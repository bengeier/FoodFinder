{"text":"We went to Scarpetta to celebrate our 9 year anniversary. As requested, they gave us a table so we could see the Bellagio fountains.  Our reservation was at 9 PM and we were disappointed to find out that the chef was no longer offering the tasting menu that evening. Our waiter, however, said we could create our own tasting - excellent!  

We started with the polenta with mushrooms - delicious, but it maybe could have used a bit more salt. Next up was the infamous $24 spaghetti. Well worth it - this is the best pasta I ever ate. Since we were indulging, the next course was more pasta. The duck and foie gras ravioli. It was good, but very rich and not even close to as good as the beef cheek ravioli from Carnevino. I am not sure why people would compare the two. On carb overload we then had the lamb which was fantastic. For some reason they also sent out a duck entree which we had not ordered. Not a fan of the spices - cardamom and clove. Nor was I a fan of the waiter attempting to charge us for it. 
Dessert was the chocolate salted caramel cake. Good, but nothing to rave about. 

Wine prices are high but on par with everything else on the strip. 

Oh, I almost forgot the bread basket and dipping sauces. The Stromboli bread with salami and cheese is phenomenal. The marscapone butter could make even cheap white bread taste good. 

Definitely worth a visit to try the spaghetti. I will be going back for that!"}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is AMAZING! We had an amazing view, the food was fantastic, and the staff, were all very helpful and friendly. The Chef, Chef Dave even came out to see how we enjoyed the food. I've never met such a great Chef!  I will make sure to come here again next time I make a trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Scarpetta is renowned Italian Chef Scott Conant's masterpiece. There are five throughout the U.S. - New York, Miami, Las Vegas (in the Cosmopolitan), Toronto, and Beverly Hills. I first heard about Scarpetta from my boyfriend's sister, as we both like to watch Conant on Chopped on the Food Network. 

We started the night off with two cocktails - Scarselli and Dolce Limone. Good, as always. They gave us complimentary bread: sourdough, french, rosemary, and a stromboli. Along with the bread were marscapone butter, eggplant and tomato-herb spread, and a citrus-infused olive oil. The stromboli was definitely the best, but the eggplant/tomato-herb spread was really good. As our appetizer, we chose the Tuna 'Susci' ($16), which as you can see is raw tuna wrapped around vegetables. The tart-marinated vegetables complimented the fresh tuna very well.

After reading so many good things about the spaghetti, I had to find out if this is really the best pasta you will ever have. Usually, I am disappointed with certain dishes because people have hyped them up way too much. But for once, the spaghetti ($24) lived up to its hype. Wow, I honestly can't believe spaghetti could taste this good. The pasta is cooked to perfection - consistency, texture, taste - everything was on point. Then there's the sauce, ahhhhh. You can taste the fresh tomatos and the basil in every single bite. I am speechless, really.

Although the spaghetti was definitely the highlight of the night, the duck and foie gras ravioli ($25) comes pretty close. Once again, the ravioli was cooked perfectly (as expected). But what really made this dish stand out was the filling. Duck - check. Foie Gras - check. Can you ask for anything more? Two of some of my favorite things to eat are mixed together and stuffed into a ravioli. It is the right amount of duck and the right amount of foie gras - not overpowering at all. The marsala reduction adds a nice and clean finishing touch to this already, perfect dish.

As for dessert, we opted for the chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce. The cake was just like every other molten chocolate cake, but the toasted almond gelato and the salted caramel sauce was goooooood. I wouldn't order it again, only because I would want to try their other desserts.

For two cocktails, a beer, an appetizer, two entrees, and dessert, our bill came out to be about $125. Not that bad considering all the food and drinks we got. The entrees may seem pricey (especially the spaghetti), but you actually get a good amount in one order. When I come back (hopefully soon), I would definitely get the spaghetti again. Everything else, I would switch out only so I can try other items on their menu. But if it is your first time going, I highly recommend the spaghetti and the ravioli. Then, you can also say you just had the best spaghetti in your entire life!"}
{"text":"Really best Italian, I'll say above average. 
Really get fooled by yelp. 
Sorry I was really looking foward to good pasta."}
{"text":"Impressed - knew of Scott Conent from his appearances as a nit-picky (and not always very nice) judge on Chopped and we were intrigued enough to try this place for dinner.

Service was impeccable, and the ambiance was sophisticated and serene - quite a contrast to the less tasteful (and less dressed) crowd outside of the restaurant.

Highlights:
- roasted diver scallops - wonderful, beautifully seared and nicely complemented by the peas
- bread basket - quite the variety and served with an eggplant tapenade
- agnolotti - unctuous and decadent tasting little pillows 
- fennel dusted cod - elegant flavors and well cooked
- desserts - hazelnut cake with poached pears and a decadent chocolate almond cake

Could improve:
- artic char was overdone
- spaghetti was done well, al dente and with just the right amount of tomato basil...but way overpriced
- wine list was clearly very very marked up 
 
Overall, very enjoyable meal and a welcome reprieve from the LV scene."}
{"text":"If I could put 10 stars I would! Food is beyond amazing from appetizers to deserts. Service excellent. Thank you so much for great time and experience! Definitely coming back again! It's a must!!!!!!"}
{"text":"What an awesome italian restaurant.  The entrance is super secluded, and as the hostess led us down an empty hallway it seemed like the place was abandoned, but the hallway opened up into a large dining room.  We were seated by the windows and could see the Bellagio fountains which was nice. 
    I got the Berry Smash to drink which was very average, a little too strong for my taste.  The bread basket they brought out was great, focacia, french bread and one more were average.  The best bread had salami and basil and maybe even cheese baked into it- SO GOOD.  There was a citrus olive oil to dip in, as well as butter, and an eggplant tomato spread.  Definitely helped to liven up the more basic bread.  
     The duck and foie gras ravioli were great.  First time having foie gras and we were not disappointed.  Rich and delicious.  The spaghetti was unreal good- I did not think spaghetti could be that great.  Finally, the veal chop looked great, and was very rich and tender.  The chocolate cake for dessert was probably the low point- it reminded us of an Applebee's dessert, although the presentation was slightly better than that.  
     The only other con was our server- he was very awkward and seemed to appear at all the wrong times to talk to us about the menu.  He rambled on about dishes just a little too much.  
     Would definitely have given a 5 with a different server and had we picked a different and hopefully better dessert."}
{"text":"This place is quite good.   I've only been twice, but the food has been good and the ambiance is great.  Try to get a table by the window and you can watch the Bellagio fountain show while you eat.  

I had the pasta and the rib cap. Both were good.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. I ate here last night with a group of three others, the entire experience was wonderful. The restauraunt is beautiful and has a great view overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. I started with the wine list. I had read one review on yelp from a reviewer complaining there were hardly any bottles of wine under 100.00, I thought the wine menu was really varied and there were many price points to choose from, types, regions. This is a fine dining restauraunt so what do you expect. I chose a Riesling from France that was perfect with our food. 

The bread, holy Jesus the bread. They have about four different kinds they bring out (and keep bringing). There is a roll with salami inside that is literally to die for. The bread is accompanied by mascarpone butter, citrus infused olive oil, and some sun dried tomatoe compote. All wonderful. We started with oysters that were fresh and perfect. 

I ordered the Black fettuccine with seafood (crab, shrimp, squid) and it was incredible. This is a dish with few ingredients for a reason, fresh seafood and house made pasta really don't need many other players. I forced my boyfriend to order the special, a lamb ragu over fettuccine after we argued for five minutes (I won). This was the best ragu I have ever eaten, hands down. Incredible, we inhaled it. The portions are really good, it looks small when they present your plate but there is a lot of pasta I could hardly finish mine. 

For desert, you have to try the strawberry soufle, it literally melts in your mouth. We also had these little light donuts filled with with banan creme and Nutella. Enough said. 

The waitstaff was wonderful, very warm and attentive. Our waiter was fantastic, everyone was. 

You have to make a reservation ahead for this place, we landed in Vegas on a Wednesday and the cosmopolitan concierge had to squeeze is in."}
{"text":"Scarpetta knows how to make a girl happy.  I went there this past Sunday for my very good friend's birthday dinner. She said she had the spaghetti a year ago in Miami and has been dreaming about it ever since.  Now I know why!
Before I get too far ahead of myself though, let me start at the beginning of my experience. My group was pretty large and scattered throughout the strip. A few of us were fashionably late but the hostess had no problem seating those of us who were there on time. That's uncommon for shi-shi- type places and I really appreciated it. The decor was a dark/ modern/ rustic all-at-the-same time- type of feel. Very sexy place :o) Plus it overlooks the Bellagio fountains and the Strip! Nothing like enjoying a killer meal with that type of view. 
The sommelier was a delight. He helped us pick out a wine that had the qualities we wanted without breaking the bank. We thought it was hilarious when he said \"How about this vintage\" while pointing right at the price. Very classy way to help price-concerned consumers w/o announcing to the entire room that we were trying to save money.
A bread basket is usually of no consequence BUT, here, it was SOOOOO good! One roll in particular had prosciutto or salami wrapped in and it was amazing! Fresh, warm, and perfect!
We shared a bunch of starters.  I got the yellowtail fully intending to share but that did not happen. It was so fresh and delicious with the shredded red onion on top that it somehow disappeared before I could send my plate around the table... OOPS!  I also managed to get a bite for my friend's creamy polenta. To. Die. For. says it all.
Next, our main course  - the spaghetti. Let me preface this by saying that 6 out the 7 people in our party ordered it because my friend hyped it up so much. We were not disappointed. I normally try to stay away from carbs and I seriously cannot remember the last time I went out and actually ordered spaghetti! It was just so good! It wasn't a heavy, flowery mess of wet spaghetti strands. It was light, tasty, cooked, and sauced to perfection. PS. it was great on its own - no meatballs or anything necessary to dress it up. That is a plate I would certainly order again. 
In sum, I had a great experience. I paid ~ $100 for bread, pasta, some sashimi, and 3 glasses of wine and I still can say that it was well worth the price.  I would go back and definitely recommend Scarpetta - Vegas to friends!  :o)"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with friends on May 6.  I believe reservations were early, 6pm.  Got there early and had drink at the bar.  Great variety....no beers on tap but some interesting bottled beers.

Our group shared a few apps.  I sampled the oysters, which if I recall had a mignonette sauce which was excellent, very \"bright\" tasting.  Also had the lentils and squid.  The lentils were amazing and the squid perfectly cooked.  

For dinner I had the \"Pici\" (pasta) served with lobster, tarragon, almond & chili pesto.  It was perfectly portioned but still a little \"heavy\".  I paired that with a side order of broccoli rabe and a nice house Chianti.  No dessert for our group.   Others had the short-rib dish (which looked great but small).

Service was fine, the waiter seemed very knowledgeable.  Great views in this hip hotel.  Would recommend/go again."}
{"text":"Service- The service was nice when it was existent. It took 30/40 mins for a glass of water and wine and then another 40 for our food. Dinner took way to long. The server kinda made up for it towards the end after we pointed it out. 

Food- the dishes are very hit and miss. Some are good and others are very basic for their price point. Overall very unimpressed for the cost of this placed

Ambiance- beautiful very dim and romantic"}
{"text":"I would rate this place a solid 4 stars for the decor, service and food. My fiancé had the duck and foie gras ravioli and I had the Pici (lobster pasta). Both entrees were good, but the dessert was definitely a delicious sweet ending. We ordered the Nutella & Vanilla Creme Bomboloni (mini filled donuts) and they were a little taste of heaven. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"A Vegas must, every time we go to Vegas we visit Scarpetta. One of my husbands favorites. We always sit at the bar, sometimes it's slow, though we still seem to have a great time and great food. When its busy the energy is definitely flowing in a positive Vegas way."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner here. Would have given this restaurant 4 stars if not for the terrible service from our waiter Roberto. 
He seemed to be completely preoccupied with the couple at the table next to us. After our entrees were cleared and we declined dessert, we waited over 15 minutes for our check before we waved down a passing busboy and asked him to send Roberto to our table. Rather than coming himself, he sent the busboy with the check even though Roberto visited the table right next to us about 5 times after our plates were cleared. We were not rude to him in any way, shape or form so I can't imagine why he chose to behave that way. He came by to say sorry as we were signing the check. Too bad because the food and atmosphere were nice and it would have been a pleasant experience if he had made the slightest effort."}
{"text":"My husband took me there on our anniversary day. He noted it on the reservation and we were seated next to the window! We had a strip view and were able to see the fountain of Bellagio. Good atmosphere and ambience.

Food wise, it was awesome! I don't hate Italian food but it is not something that I am a big fan of. But I loved the Italian food here at Scarpetta! I think I had the best pasta in my life here! I tried different Italian places in the past that made homemade fresh pasta, but they aren't as good as the homemade pasta here at Scarpetta! I am impressed! I had the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti, it tasted great!
 My husband's veal ragu fettuccine was awesome too. We loved them a lot. At the end, I had a strawberry souffle and my husband's had a dessert that I don't remember the exact name. From my memory, his dessert tasted good and had an interesting presentation. Anyway, my souffle was awesome, I think it was the best I had by far, better than what I had in other French restaurants in the past (e.g. Andres, Eiffel). Everything was awesome. We became a fan. Highly recommend this place to yelpers!
At the end, they also gave us some sweet treats for our anniversary. Those tasted good too!"}
{"text":"We tried 500 tonight after hearing many good things, and we weren't disappointed. Had some great appetizers - the funghi tartufa and meatballs were very tasty, and the arancini were fantastic!  We all had pasta, which were universally enjoyed, but next time, we try the pizza - it looked amazing!  The service was great, and Gennaro, the chef, was extremely charming. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I admit... The food was pretty good.  However, the service was terrible.  We were 5 min late for our reservation and they made us wait 1 hour at the bar (seated after 9:30)  The hostess was incredibly rude and it took almost 30 min to get service at the bar.  When we were finally seated the service only got worse.  They didn't refill our waters or wine glasses once.  They served our first course to another table and never once explained what was laid in front of us.  They knew how terrible the service was (we have said nothing at this point) so they offered us free dessert.  But... The kicker was the $50 bottle if wine that ended up as $100 on the bill.  We were amazed so we asked the table next to us how their meal was.  Turns out they were getting a free meal due to the 5 reservation changes made by the restaurant.  Hope this place gets their act together.  Currently it's an embarassment to a hotel that's trying to be upscale.  Hype not quality."}
{"text":"This will be my VERY FIRST Yelp review and I couldn't be more excited to post it! I look to Yelp on a daily basis but have never felt as compelled to leave a review as I do about our experience at Scarpetta...spoiler alert: this could get lengthy! 

My boyfriend and I were taking a mini vacation to Vegas and did extensive research on restaurants, as we wanted to treat ourselves to one night of fine dining while we were there. We found Scarpetta's Yelp listing and looked through every single photo and read a ton of reviews (even the not so great ones :( )and decided this was going to be our place! 

Our reservation was for 10p.m. but we arrived at around 9 and were told we could be accommodated immediately. I asked if there was any possibility of getting a window table, and apologized for not requesting it when we made our res. The extremely nice hostess told us that wouldn't be a problem at all and after waiting, maybe 2 minutes tops, we were taken to our table. They weren't kidding about the view by the window! The view was gorgeous and we were looking right out at the Bellagio water show(s).  The lighting IS very dark, but for us that made it even more romantic, which was the exact experience we were hoping for. 

Our cocktails were EXCELLENT. I had a \"basic\" dirty martini with blue cheese olives and it was by far the best martini I've ever had.  Our server, Julian, even brought a tiny shot glass of extra olive juice just in case it was still too dry for my taste, but I didn't need it!  

For starters, we chose the Diver Scallops and the White Corn Soup. When they were brought to our table, the server mentioned they took it upon themselves to split the scallops for us so that \"we could each get the best of what the dish had to offer.\"  Julian made the excellent suggestion of combining the crispy pancetta with the rest of the dish's ingredients, rather than taste it on its own, as that was how the chef intended for it to be eaten.  He was SO right! What an absolutely delicious combination and just the perfect portion size.  The soup was served in one bowl for us to share, and once again, we were blown away. Just enough king crab to give it a bit of body, but still a light enough soup that we were able to enjoy it and be ready for more (so, so much more!)

They gave us the complimentary basket of warm fresh breads and again we were surprised because of the variety they provided! Even most nice restaurants will give you one or two selections, but here? 5 choices and then 3 options for spreads/ dipping. 

We finished our amazing cocktails and decided to each get a glass of wine to compliment our meal.  As soon as the wine list was brought back to our table, a man came over and introduced himself as the sommelier and asked if he could suggest any wines to accompany our entrees.  I drink white and my boyfriend drinks red, and we got very different entrees, but the sommelier was extremely helpful and described the selections perfectly.  Naturally, we chose his suggestions! 

Now on to the entrees:  My boyfriend chose the duck ravioli and I went with the tagliatelle dish. Amazing, Amazing, Amazing! When I asked Julian to please give a bit more detail about the Tagliatelle entree, he described it as \"definitely more of a comfort meal\" and he couldn't have been more right.  The pasta was extremely fresh and even though the sauce itself was on the heavier side, it did not overwhelm the dish at all.  I'm not a fan of duck but my boyfriend could not say enough great things about his dish and the presentation was perfect! The sommelier stopped back after we sipped our wine for a bit and asked how the flavors were complimenting the dishes. He was just doing his job but made us feel important, none the less. 

Dinner was cleared and we were so full but they hadn't let us down yet so we chose the Amedei chocolate cake. Heaven! Just enough of everything on the plate for you to enjoy it without setting yourself over the edge. 

I do apologize for the length of this review, but I felt that sharing this absolutely amazing experience was important for anyone that might be on the fence about trying this place! The ambiance was romantic, relaxing, and quiet with beautiful views- perfect for a date night.  The service was excellent.  When we choose to \"dine\" we like to sit and relax and enjoy  and not feel rushed and we were not disappointed here.  We never felt rushed nor did we feel neglected either.  They seemed to understand that we were there to enjoy ourselves and never made us feel like we were hanging around too long/ late.  The presentation of every single plate was perfection.  The food was some of the best we've ever had. I can definitely appreciate that restaurants can't be a \"10\" every single night, and things do sometimes happen, but our experience was outstanding and will definitely be somewhere we come back to the next time we're in town!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely dreadful.  We ordered the famous spaghetti as a starter which was forgotten about by the server.  He informed us that the chef had already thrown out the pasta water (despite being 30 minutes before close).  Our entrees arrived and only 1 was PASSABLE.  Pasta was undercooked and rubbery.  Wine selection was mediocre, especially if you're looking at getting a bottle for under 150 dollars. Terrible service, terrible food.  You should be ashamed"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful addition to the Las Vegas food scene. This is not your father's Olive Garden - this is a fine dining Italian food experience. Side note - it's not inexpensive. I'm happy to say that someone else picked up the tab for my visit and encouraged me to order whatever I wanted, so I did.

The service is what you'd expect from a restaurant like this - the entire staff is attentive, polite and knowledgeable.  I had some questions about a few of the dishes and my server didn't give me the old, \"hang on, let me check\" or the bald faced lie.  

I started with the creamy polenta mostly because I've never had creamy polenta before. It was good. Not what I expected, but it was quite tasty. An excellent starter.

Since I wasn't paying, I ordered the veal chop which comes with a side of spaghetti, squash, and mushrooms.  Cooked perfectly and it was delicious.

Although I was full my host had ordered a banana souffle and I hated to see it go to waste.  Wow - just Wow.

Excellent food and service in a beautifully appointed restaurant.  No, it wasn't cheap but it was well worth the price. Note - they also have a gluten free and vegetarian menus."}
{"text":"I was really excited for our dinner to Scarpetta with some friends. The service was good, but the food was very underwhelming. I just expected more from Scott Conant. The food wasn't bad, just average and at the prices you're paying to dine here the food better not be average."}
{"text":"For the price of this place I found it to be just OK. Heirloom tomato salad was good but not great. Duck ravioli was a bit disappointing. The menu does offer many creative dishes and things you wouldn't find at your typical Italian place."}
{"text":"Scarpetta is classy, modern restaurant. The main dining room gives you a great view of the Bellagio Fountain and is a great place to take a date. I have to mention that the music was perfect. It was swanky downtempo electronic music. Awesome. 

I love beef tartars...especially the korean/japanese yuk-hoe, so as an appetizer, I decided to order the Wagyu Beef Tartare and for dinner I ordered the famous Duck Foie Gras Ravioli.

The server brought out an assortments of bread to soothe my appetite. There was sourdough, french bread, rosemary bread, and stromboli. The bread came with a trio of butter, tomato-herb salad, and a lime-infused olive oil. The stromboli was the bomb.

The beef tartar came out next and I was extremely underwhelmed by it. The meat lacked flavor and the side salad was too salty. There is also a cured egg in it, which I did not taste at all. I did like the hazelnut garnish tho. All in all, 2/5 stars for this dish. 

Finally, the duck foie gras ravioli came out and it did not disappoint. They were small pockets of ravioli stuffed with a mixture of duck liver and duck confit, all topped with balsamic vineger and scallions. The pasta was fresh and incredibly delicate. It was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. My only knock on it was that I was not full at all. 4.5/5 stars."}
{"text":"One of the top dining experiences of my life!  The food was fantastic; the strawberry rhubarb souffle may be the best dessert I've ever had.  The service was just about perfect; knowledgeable waiter; we were not rushed; beautiful presentation.  I did not think that it was overpriced given the quality of the experience.  I will definitely return when I am in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Tremendous menu and top notch service. Our host, Noe, was one of the finest I've had the pleasure of meeting. He and his staff could not have done a better job of taking care of our table for 12. Thanks to him and @MannyKess from TonightImVIP.com we had an amazing meal and experience."}
{"text":"Scarpettas in the cosmopolitan was one of the best experiences we have ever had in Vegas. The food was delicious from apps to entrees. Caesar salad with the lemon zest was amazing and they split it for the two that were eating. I had the tuna avocado salad appetizer which was the most amazing app ever!  For entrees we had branzzino which was very flavorful with a kick. The orecchiette with homemade sausage and broccoli rabe in a clam sauce was fabulous!! . The final entree was pici a pasta with lobster with a chili kick.  We shared them all and eaxh of them were exceptional. We also has the best service with Julian as the most amazing server. He was a best server and also got our silly sense of humor and went along wth it."}
{"text":"I loved everything about Scarpetta, from the food to the great ambiance overlooking the Bellagio water show. 
Scott Conant puts his own unique twists on Italian classics, starting with the bread basket accompanied creamy butter, sun dried tomatoes and citrus infused olive oil, which is a very nice touch. Let's not gloss over the bread basket like you would at most of your standard restaurants, this bread basket is special. Maybe one of my favorite parts of the meal was the stromboli bread, dipped in some olive oil and topped with the sun dried tomatoes, I could eat that all day.  
Another highlight of this meal was the braised short rib risotto primi piatti, this was a flawless dish. My best description of this dish would be, homey and earthy. The risotto had perfect texture and the short ribs were melt in your mouth braised.
Next we had the spaghetti tomato basil and the duck & foie gras ravioli. Both amazing pasta dishes in their own right. 
The spaghetti tomato basil did not disappoint, the homemade pasta had just enough bite to it and the sauce was simple but deep in flavors. The tomato sauce had a buttery richness to it, with a hint of spice from the red pepper flakes, and some freshness from the basil. It's truly a perfect spaghetti.  
Duck & foie gras ravioli is very eloquent and rich. Very deep in flavors and a smooth velvety texture to the foie gras filling. The marsala reduction rich and buttery smooth in it's own right and when combined with the raviolli gives a Mike Tyson KO punch of flavor. 
I highly recommend Scarpetta. The prices are also reasonable when you consider the delicious free bread basket, which can be a meal in itself. A very delicious meal and romantic place take your significant other, what more could you ask for. Absolutely a 5 star restaurant.

As great as this meal was the one thing that stands out to me is the stromboli bread with the complimentary bread basket with olive oils and sun dried tomatoes."}
{"text":"even though it's located in the mall-ish portion of the cosmo, place is very elegant, with great views if you get a window seat.

food was very good, we had the scallop appetizer, duck breast and duck ravioli entrees, and goat cheese cheesecake for dessert. everything came out perfect, and service was excellent."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! My husband and I actually started off at D.O.C.G. and were sat in a booth up against the wall. We had no room and were too close to the next couple so I decided we should just go to Scarpetta instead. The décor is absolutely beautiful! We sat at a table by the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains and it was stunning. So far happy with my decision. 

We had the short ribs and the tuna susci appetizer. The short ribs were good but nothing about them stood out as amazing. The risotto that came with them was just ok. The tuna appetizer was out of this world. The marinated veggies that came with were just so delicious and they went so well with the thinly sliced tuna. 

For our entrees, my husband had the NY strip and I had the Orata. The steak was seasoned perfectly and it was very good. The Orata was somewhat different from what I expected. It is a very light dish so if you are watching your waistline, I would recommend it. The fish was cooked well and wasn't dry at all, just lacking some seasoning in my opinion. The tomato based broth was also a little bland but overall it was a good dish. We also ordered the glazed carrots to go along with our meal. OMG, I couldn't stop eating these even after I was full. They were so good!! 

Overall a great dining experience. I would like to go back and try some pasta next time. I also thought the service was excellent and the staff was very welcoming."}
{"text":"Scarpetta was one of the best dining experiences I have had.  The atmosphere is quiet and romantic and we had a view of the Bellagio fountains from our table.  The pasta was amazing - my husband had the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli and I had the Branzino.  Both were excellent dishes."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely sh*t. The food was fantastic. Waited for at least 5 minutes standing at the door before someone even noticed us. Then finally seated, thank goodness for a reservation. Live music. Nice ambiance, candles included. Highly recommend trying the prawns to start. Both my husband and I had pasta. I had a tagliatelle dish with mushrooms and he the lasagna. The tagliatelle tasted much better than the lasagna but still good. Service throughout the entire experience was beyond pathetic. It would even keep me from returning. The servers seemed very disorganized and flustered and did not compose themselves in a professional manner. It was entirely frustrating. I expected more from a place that had such great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"400+ positive reviews says it all.  

Scarpetta was one of the best dining experiences that I've had in Las Vegas, and one of the best Italian restaurants that I have been to. Our group of 8 got a semi-private room facing the Bellagio fountains, and from the moment we stepped in, the service was just top notch. Our server was professional, attentive, and extremely knowledgeable about the menu and gave some great pasta recommendations...and it didn't hurt that the pastas, for once, were actually big enough for a person to have as an entree. I went with the sheep milk ricotta agnolotti with truffles and parmesan (TO DIE FOR!), but the real hit at our table was the lobster pici.

It's always the little touches that push a restaurant into 5-star territory for me, and at Scarpetta, it was our fantastic server bringing us a free tiramisu (also to die for...and I don't even like tiramisu!) for bringing one of our dishes out a tad late, and a plate of Italian cookies with a chocolate \"Congratulations\" message on the plate after finding out that one of us was getting married. If I can get a table, this is an absolute must-visit every time I go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I don't review often so when I do it's good! First time here and I came with my wife for our anniversary. The atmosphere and service was fantastic, chefs choice dinner was exceptional. You must give this place a try."}
{"text":"Amazing meal.  Went with my family after trying the food at Cochon 555 event.  The restaurant does have great views of the strip.  I like the clean design of the restaurant.  The service was great.  Every single person from hostess to maitre d to waiter to bus boys was incredibly attentive and friendly.  The food was fantastic.  We had the tasting menu.  It's a great deal for $85 per person.  So much food, you won't come out hungry. They've selected the dishes they are best known for as part of their tasting menu.  I love how the first couple courses are paired with another dish that is shared by the table.  It feels like you are having 10 dishes!  We also did the wine pairing.  Very generous pours.  My favorite dishes were the short rib agnoletti and home-made pasta.  Devine meal.  Definitely will come back and try some other dishes!  Scott Conant and his team have done a fabulous job."}
{"text":"Least favorite restaurant we have eaten at in Vegas.  I ordered the sea trout, husband got Kobe flat iron steak, friends shared a Caesar salad and Pici.  I liked the sea trout okay, not fantastic.  Husband liked his steak, but not the best for what it cost.  Friends couldn't finish the Caesar salad or Pici, & the portions are small.  They didn't like it & there was hardly any lobster in the Pici.  Expensive and food was not memorable.  The bread basket was good though.  Wouldn't come back and wouldn't recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"We had the best gnocchi and pizza ever! Also had the meatballs and arancini that was from heaven. Delicious drinks and desserts. Beautiful interior, excellent service, and reasonable pricing. How is this place not ridiculously busy? Absolutely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Made reservations and requested a window seat -- we didn't get right next to the window but we got 2nd row next to it so we were still able to look over to our table mates and see the water show. (All the tables that actually had front view of the Bellagio water show could've cared less about the water show!) The view really is amazing. The ambiance is nice and romantic, with Justin Timberlake singing in the background. The bread baskets were as delicious as everyone mentioned, and if you ask they do give another basket. Ordered the spaghetti because everyone mentioned how great it was -- it was yummy but not sure $24 yummy. Ordered a bottle of wine which was a task because they had so many options! Service was great and it was a nice fine dining experience."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews here, I decided to try the fantastic Pasta place that Yelpers are craving about.  The restaurant is located on the third floor at Cosmopolitan Hotel and it is an easy find once you reach there.  It's a nice high end restaurant and you can pick the window seat so you get to overlook the Bellagio fountain.

We are a huge party so I get to try couple different appetizers and main dish.  I have to say, it is a total disappointment.  Not to bash on their food because the food actually  taste from ok to good, but the food does not taste like the level when you are spending 50 dollars a person.  It lacks that \"wow\" factor.  

To further breakdown the night, there are two things that wowed me.  First, is their salami bread, it is really tasty and you rarely see it from any other restaurant. Second, is their creamy polenta, you need to eat it while its hot and it is delicious.

However, all the other dishes are mediocre at best.  I ordered the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli, and it is SO SALTY.  I love salty food and always add extra pepper and salt on my french fries, and even I have a hard time taking on the saltiness of its Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli.  Also, their tomato & basil spaghetti is very plain.  Taste good if it is $15, but not at $24.  

One worst part is their restroom.  They have 1 female and 1 male restroom, and you can only use it one person at a time.  So, during the night, people kept waiting in line for restroom.  I understand the fact that you can exit the restaurant and there is another Cosmopolitan restroom outside, but isn't it a little absurd when you have only one bathroom stall in the restaurant.  

Overall, it is not my best Vegas restaurant experience, I would rate it somewhere between 2.5 stars to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Had a great dining experience at Scarpetta last night but almost missed it. Tried to make an 8pm reservation on Open Table but were shown closest time available was 9:30pm.  Called the restaurant directly to see what could be done and was told no problem come at 8pm.  Restaurant was barley half full at 8pm so call directly.  Meal and staff were incredible.  Option to add shaved white truffles a gem!"}
{"text":"great ambiance, delicately prepared dishes.
love the \"free\" warm bread brought to table so quickly upon seated."}
{"text":"One of the best fine dinning experiences I've had. Everything from the dim lighting to the friendly staff and the incredible food came together for a once-in-a-lifetime meal. We sat next to the window, so we got a great view of the Bellagio fountain. I'm still dreaming of the Black Tagliolini. Order it! It's the perfect balance of salty sea, cream, and butter. It was well balanced, not overly sauced and the tobiko added a nice texture. They are famous for the Spaghetti and it didn't disappoint. The noodles were al dente and the sauce was complex. You could taste the time and care that was put into it. The Amedei Chocolate Cake was a surprise hit. There was a rich chocolate ganache inside and a coco powder dusting outside, which went perfectly with the almond gelato. It reminded me of a well-made truffle. The next time I'm in Vegas I will make sure to visit Scarpetta again."}
{"text":"This restaurant has fabulous food and fantastic service, worth every penny!  The Sommelier was great with his suggestions and he didn't try to gouge us."}
{"text":"Service here was fantastic. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and able to answer all of our questions. The food came out very quickly for our table of 5.

I ordered duck and foie gras ravioli and was unable to finish it as it was quite heavy and oily. This is probably a dish best for sharing since it's so creamy."}
{"text":"Delicious in every aspect!  We had the tasting menu,  and it was worth every single penny. Everything was delicious, but I will be dreaming of the polenta the rest of my life! We were so stuffed by the end of the meal,  but of course you have to have dessert.  We had a couple different things,  but by far the best was the coconut pana cotta with the mango soup.  To die for. Great service, great food,  and a great atmosphere.  I will totally recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"File Under: A must if you are looking for AMAZING Italian in the center of the strip with a view

{"text":"The food was Ok, we got Pici and the portion was small and very fishy tasting. The bread was great and it comes with oil and a butter and a ciabatta which is excellent. I got the roasted organic chicken which was cruncy on the outside and moist on the inside. The wine list is extensive, the glass was pricy. We had a group of 4 guys next to us that had been drinking and they were loud and obnoxious, so it was not the best for me and the wife. It is in Vegas so that maybe expected. The pricing seemed a bit high."}
{"text":"Sommelier was too harsh with the wine pouring. 
We were still working on our appetizers when they tried to rush us to move to the pasta dishes. Big no-no!! 
Dishes were good but not worth the Vegas price."}
{"text":"Once we were shown our table, our server  was right behind with the wine list and menu. Awesome. My Manhattan was made perfectly and my bf's dirty martini was made just dirty enough. We knew that Scarpetta's known for their homemade pastas so that's what we focused on - we got the short-rib and bone marrow agnolotti, duck and foie gras ravioli, lamb ragu fettucine and the Brussels sprouts as main courses. The brussel sprouts were meh. The lamb ragu was good but the agnolotti and ravioli were amazing! Had the grilled Dover scallops for and appetizer and they were awesome and the bombalini with Nutella were phenomenal. We were seated by the windows where you could watch the Bellagio water show so that made the meal even more special."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food, but the server ruined it for us.  His name was Jason and he was so arrogant and non-communicative that he simply didn't hear our needs."}
{"text":"We dined there last week. It was awful. The service...the food. The atmosphere is nice and a cool vibe, although we were seated by the beautiful fountain views and I looked up and the curtain was covered in dust balls. Ugh! 

I ordered a gluten free pasta so gave them some room on how bad the entree tasted and looked but even my husband who is not picky could not eat his short rib pasta dish. It was so greasy. The service was bad too, we waited a very long time for a waiter to come up to us. He made a rude face about another bus boy that bumped into him. It is not a high end dining experience at all. 

We were very disappointed."}
{"text":"I will open this review with a recommendation: come here for the pasta. The pasta was spectacular. If I come back it will be just to have a pasta course, maybe will even try 2 pastas. The primi and piatti are forgettable and not worth the money.

Here's the full review:

The room is pretty plain. I've done a lot of traveling for work and it reminded me of a standard upscale hotel restaurant. It actually reminded me a lot of the Keg in The Westin in Calgary, but without the fireplaces.

Primi: I had the Grilled Mediterranea Octopus, my date had the Tuna \"Susci\". The Tuna was nice and fresh, but plain and couldn't really taste the truffles. The octopus was cooked nice and tender, however it was evident that it was a bit old from a fishy smell that piles of capers attempted to disguise. The description said \"crispy potatoes\" but they were completely mushy. The entire dish was very soft and gave the impression that it may have been reheated. All in all both apps were just ok, definitely not worth the price tag.

Paste: This was by far the star of the show. I had the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli, my date had the Agnolotti Dal Plin. Both were fresh, tasty and just fantastic. The pickled mustard seeds in the agnolotti gave an incredibly pleasing texture and flavour. The pasta was fresh, delicate and made with care. The ravioli was equally delicious and the beautifully displayed triangle shapes made me feel like I was eating special little pockets of delight. Both sauces were very light and complimented the stuffed pastas without competing with the flavour. If we had only ordered pastas this would be a 5 star review.

Piatti: I had the Balsamic Glazed Duck Breast, my date had the Pork Chop (not currently on their online menu). The chop was good, not great. It was a surprisingly huge portion after the other delicate dishes. The fatty end of the chop, we guessed, had been deep fried after cooking which my date thoroughly enjoyed and was a nice touch. The disappointment of this dish were the sour cherries (which were highlighted on the menu) had no flavor. The duck breast was a big let down. It was cooked well but was tough, not a good piece of duck and under-seasoned. I believe it was under-seasoned because the dish included large pieces of speck which when eaten with the duck gave it the saltiness it needed, but the flavour of the speck was way too strong for this dish. I started picking it out because it was all I could taste and when you order duck, you kinda want it to taste like duck.

The service was attentive and polite. Our server gave a good suggestion for wine but couldn't answer some questions we had about one of the dishes. Overall it was an enjoyable evening. I just find for these prices there are better restaurants in Toronto. However as I said, it would be worth it to go and try the pastas."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great, and it builds your expectations. Prepare for disappointment, however. The \"susci\" while beautifully prepared is bland and falls flat. The short rib appetizer is much better, but disappointingly small serving. Got the seafood pasta of crab, lobster, and shrimp. The seafood portion is generous, but the flat pasta sticks together and congeals into a doughy mess. Finally, the hostess was rude and obnoxious. Come on, your job is to just seat people and answer basic questions. You can't be polite? Overall, Spago is much better bang for your buck in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience. The food and service were amazing. The menu is pricey but you definitely get what you pay for. Would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"My partner and I came in with a $35 Groupon. We made our reservation for 7 PM and ended up coming in around 6 PM, but they were very accommodating. Our waiter was friendly, but was constantly trying to upsell, which got a bit grating after awhile. We ordered the fries to start. They were VERY cooked, but the taste made up for it. For mains, we ordered the Pollo and Formaggio pizzas. The toppings were very good, though the Formaggio was super strong. The Pollo was my favourite, though I wish the toppings had been more evenly distributed. The caramelized onions gave the Pollo a nice sweet taste and the mushrooms were delicious. In both cases, the crust wasn't great - it was super hard and tasted like it was really just flour and water. I also ordered a cappuccino, but it was far too bitter for my taste, even with two sugar cubes.

The food was pretty good, and I'd give it about 4 stars, but we were also nickel and dimed in addition to the constant attempts to upsell - though our Groupon was for $35, they deducted only $34.50. The waiter informed me that this was because they had taken off items that added up to $34.50 - this made me wonder what they would have done if I hadn't ordered the cappuccino, as nothing added together would have come close to $35. When I pay for a $35 Groupon, I kind of expect to have $35 deducted from my bill. I'm not going to make a fuss over $0.50, but I found it quite tacky."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant on our last night in Vegas. The restaurant decor is beautiful. I ordered the octopus as an appetizer. It was good but not the best I've had. My entree was the crab pasta. This dish had little fish eggs in it. I enjoyed my dish. 

This is a very pricey restaurant $$$$. I could not find the prices online before going. Overall it was a good experience but for the money, I will try another restaurant on my next visit. Our check for 3 was about $212 which included 2 drinks and 2 glasses of wine. The was not a bottle of wine on the menu less than $100."}
{"text":"They had a special this week. 3 course menu for $45 with wine pairing add $25. I initially thought there would be 3 glass of wine, one for each dish makes sense no? But no. Just 2 glasses white and red can't remember their names. 

We ordered CREAMY POLENTA and YELLOWTAIL. i tasted the polenta and wish I had ordered that. It was delicious. Should have known as it was scarpettta scinserNothing I've ever tastes before.  the yellowtail was good too. Not smelly. Not bad for portions. 6pcs 

As for mains we ordered AGNOLOTTI DAL PLIN and I got SPICED DUCK BREAST Got quite a lot of pcs of duck meat like about 10 pcs.  I could not finish it all. I would have like his agnolotti dish better. 

For desert we ordered STRAWBERRY SFOGLIA and COCONUT PANNA COTTA  both very good. 

The best part of the meal were the warm bread served in the beginning. It was moist delicious and served with a Stromboli which I later found is a turnover w meat and cheese. So good. I want more now!"}
{"text":"Scott conant really is a genius. Service was attentive and part of the overall amazing experience. Matthew was our server and was incredible. Tuna \"suchi\", fritto misto, spaghetti, duck and foie GRAS ravioli were all outstanding dishes. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great place for a nice romantic dinner with a view of the Bellagio fountains! Staff is so nice and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. The beat salad, spaghetti and the sea bass! Noe put our meal together for us and made us all very happy!  Wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"In the past few weeks I've eaten at Joel Robuchon in Las Vegas, John Besh's Domenica in New Orleans and Seryna in Tokyo among many others, so I was definitely in gourmet mode as I ate at Scarpetta in Toronto. 

Firstly, the restaurant is beautiful and everything you'd expect for fine dining.  The wait staff were pleasant and attentive.

I started with the Creamy Polenta with truffled mushrooms, which is noted as a must have - it is.  It's hard to get any better.  I then had the duck and foe grais ravioli drizzled with balsamic and spaghetti with tomato and basil.  The ravioli was good, though I was left wanting more foe grais flavor - the balsamic was a great touch.  The spaghetti was outstanding, especially considering it is the middle of winter and fresh tomatoes would not be coming from an outdoor local garden.  As with the polenta, it's simply very difficult to get much better than this spaghetti, which was simple, elegant and perfectly executed.

I went in fully expecting to get the chocolate cake dessert that has been reviewed so highly.  The waitress talked me into the coconut panna cotta with guava soup & caramelized pineapple and I'm glad she did - fantastic and nice and light after a good meal.

Scarpetta is an excellent restaurant.  In overhearing conversations at other tables, I did note that the Monday night clientele were young and often inexperienced in their comments.  Perhaps, they are responsible for  giving this fine restaurant the lower than deserved reviews in the past.

I would go back and I would recommend."}
{"text":"Dinner at Scarpetta was unforgettable!  Mike was our server and he was excellent!  He gave suggestions for menu items, had a great personality and added a complimentary dessert at the end of our meal.  My husband and I had the filet (med-rare) and the duck and foie ravioli.  The filet was cooked perfectly and the pasta was incredibly fresh.  Our friends loved their dishes too (lamb and a chicken pasta).  I highly recommend saving room for dessert.  We had cheesecake, a banana soufflé and a salted caramel pudding.  Overall an amazing experience, excellent service and delicious food."}
{"text":"There was a large selection of items, so it was a nice to see a variety of menu options selected. We're told that this restaurant makes their own pasta & sauces fresh, in-house, and in my humble opinion, you could certainly taste it! The best part is that 93% of the menu can be made Gluten Free.

There were some individuals who ordered appetizers such as salads and sautéed mushrooms, while others opted to save their tastebuds for their delicious entrees. For the olive lovers in the group, some friends ordered what I believe was the delicious 'Charcuterie Board' platter as their entree that included olives, prosciutto, cheese & bread - it not only appeared quite scrumptious, I'm sure it was filling too! There was also an order of seafood linguine; a few orders of gnocchi, one mushroom special & two primavera orders - overall, it appears everyone found their meal selection quite gastronomically pleasing & appeared to enjoy every bite!

All in all, it was a good experience. We give it a 5 out of 5 and we will for sure be dining there again."}
{"text":"I was very much looking forward to my first visit to Scarpetta, I had heard great things about it and couldn't wait. 

I was surprised that the menu was so limited.  The appetizers were very limited and if you don't like seafood, tartare, or mushrooms it will be a challenge to find anything you can eat.  I wasn't able to find anything which was a bummer.  I was also surprised that there wasn't an offering of dinner salads or anything like that before the meal.  

The highlight before the entrees arrived was actually the bread, there is a warm bread that has some cheese and a salami or beef in it.  It tastes like fresh pizza bread and it is amazing.  I might visit again for this bread alone.

For the entrée, I had the veal cooked medium.  It was good but the mustard sauce was a bit tangy and was not my favorite.  I tried to limit the amount that was on my veal as much as possible.  Otherwise, the veal was cooked perfectly and seasoned well.  It was not fatty and there was plenty of meat on the bone.

For dessert I enjoyed the Nutella & Vanilla Creme Bombolini.  I had no idea what to expect but it was like mini doughnut holes filled with either the crème or the nutella in the center.  The ice cream that came with it was banana and was quite good as well.  It was a great dessert to share and I would recommend this to anyone looking for an indulgent dessert.

Service here was great.  We were checked on frequently and the food was delivered promptly after ordering."}
{"text":"Fabulous,  extremely personable service.  Every course was excellent,  from the creative cocktails through the luscious desserts."}
{"text":"Sometimes one word is enough- Perfection!

While on another trip to the sin city;) my bf and I chose to celebrate our 3 years anniversary at this restaurant after many yelping, looking for the perfect spot for this occasion .
We set at the bar area and arrived just in time for happy hour, which means we could enjoy multiple dishes and cocktails at a very reasonable price.
We orders almost the entire happy hour appetizer menu, as well as another main course from the regular menu, and were taken by every single dish.
Started with burrata crostini, short rib agnolotti (which we later ordered again since it was so phenomenal), the sea food dish, creamy polenta and the Tagliatelle
fall vegetables, truffle zabagalione & guanciale.
We finished with the most amazing Nutella mini donuts- to die for!!!
Our bar tender was ok, not very verbal, but it didn't matter since we enjoyed each other's company and the food was amazing!
If you are in Vegas, and looking for a delicious meal, don't skip this place!"}
{"text":"The past few times my husband and I have been to Vegas we've gone to Scarpetta for the Social Hour. The food/drinks were always yummy and I have a bit of a love affair going on with the potato chips they set out at the bar. So for this Vegas trip we decided to make a reservation to do the tasting menu. We made a reservation for 8pm on a Friday night (9/30/16). 

We arrived, were seated promptly, but were then left for quite awhile before the waiter came over to talk to us. I mentioned that we wanted to do the tasting menu and was informed that they don't typically do it on weekends (the website specifies that the tasting menu isn't served after 10 pm and that it must be enjoyed by the whole table, but nowhere does it say that it's not available on weekends). The waiter could see that we were disappointed so said he'd ask the kitchen. He came back a bit later and said that kitchen said it was fine, tasting menu a-go. Great! We also did the wine pairing. 

The food:
- Ok, I know you shouldn't fill up on a bread basket when you are about to do a tasting menu, but oh my god. The sourdough and the stromboli's were our favorite. 
- The first course was a duo of yellowtail and tuna that was their take on sushi. Two wonderful bites, perfect. 
- The second course was a sea scallop with corn and homemade pancetta. The sea scallop and corn were amazing. The piece of pancetta was essentially inedible because it was so incredibly overly salted (and I like salt!). It's the closest I've ever come to spitting food into my napkin. Instead, I just drank an entire glass of water. 
- It's not on the tasting menu, but they brought out an order of the polenta and mushrooms for us compliments of the chef. It was absolutely heavenly. We both kept saying we shouldn't eat all of it because we needed room for the whole meal, but it was just that good. 
- Next was the pasta course. The famous spaghetti and the short rib agnolotti. We'd had the agnolotti before during Social Hour and loved it. We were anxious to try to spaghetti after having heard so many great things about it. It was truly wonderful. Both are flawless dishes; pasta is clearly Scott Conant's specialty. When we finished this course we both looked at each other and said we'd be happy to end dinner with that. 
- Next was fennel dusted black cod. I wasn't a fan of this dish. It was too \"fishy\" for my taste, but it was my first time having black cod so I assumed I just wasn't a fan of the protein. My husband enjoyed his but ate about half as he was getting full. I should've tried his fish as he said he didn't find it overly fishy (whereas I described my piece as licking a rotting fish corpse); but, alas, I didn't. I will say, the vegetables on this plate were amazing.
- Next was duck breast. I was so excited because duck is one of my favorite things to eat. This duck was good, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't great. It was a tad overcooked and it didn't have the best sear on it. The flavors of the dish were great, the duck just could've been cooked better
-Finally, dessert. We were absolutely stuffed but dessert was just so good, an amazing chocolate cake and gelato. 

The wine:
- All I can say about the wine pairing was that each and every wine was perfect for the course and delicious. I would give the wine pairing 5 stars. 

Overall it was a great meal; but, it was just too much food. We've done a variety of tasting menus (including at e by Jose in cosmo) and this was the only one where we felt the amount of food was overwhelming. It probably has less to do with the total amount of food, as it does with there being 2 pasta courses and us having polenta. 

I would've rated our previous dining experiences at Scarpetta at the Social Hour as 5 star. I would have rated this meal as 4 star (simply because of technical flaws with the pancetta and duck breast, and slightly slow service). BUT....after we left the restaurant we started walking back to our room (in Cosmo) to change clothing before going back out. Walking down the 3rd floor hallway to the room elevators I all the sudden felt horrible. Luckily I didn't have to walk too far before finding a restroom, where I began suffering from extremely violent food poisoning. That lasted all night and into the next day. My husband was completely fine. I suspect the black cod (I'm fairly certain the issue came from Scarpetta since for breakfast/lunch we'd split dishes at other places). 

TLRD: 3 star review because while the food was amazing, the food poisoning was awful"}
{"text":"I'm torn here between 4/5 stars because of the price is high for an Italian restaurant but I have to give it 5. 

First off the complimentary bread is served with Mascarpone butter (omg nice touch). Excellent tomato/basil spaghetti...the best I've ever had. Fresh oysters, tender duck, awesome view from our booth. The clincher was the service though. Our server took great care of us and gave us perfect wine pairings. 

Thumbs up Mr. Conant..."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner at Scarpetta for our anniversary. It was the best meal we had in Vegas.  From the service to the food is five stars.  We shared the Tuna carpaccio appetizer as well as one if their special appetizers of a soft cheese,fennel and bread... I am not a cheese person and it was amazing.  For dinner I had the branzino and my wife had their famous spaghetti, both top-notch.  Be sure to ask for a table by the windows for a good view of the Bellagio fountain show!!!"}
{"text":"The service, the food and the view of the Bellagio fountains was incredible! I was very excited to eat here as I am a Chopped fan and Scott Conant is a judge on the show.  The food exceeded my expectations, it was delicious. Can't wait to eat there again!!!"}
{"text":"I used to go next door to DOCG but found out they closed, I decided to go next door  and found a plesant surprise, our favorite bartender Jessica was here! As usual Jessica made our night amazing! People like Jessica should be promoted...thank you Jess for everything you do to make our experience dining at Scarpetta amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and wonderful service from Scarpetta. Been going to this wonderful restaurant since 2013. We had our daughter's 21st birthday dinner there. Mike our server is amazing and very attentive. For starters we the divers scallops and the creamy polenta so perfectly seasoned and cooked, melts in your mouth. The duck foie gras ravioli is to die for! All the entrees from the Branzino, Filet mignon are so flavorful. Everything is made with shear perfection. The Soufflés are out of this world and worth the wait! 5 stars this restaurant should be rated!"}
{"text":"I almost never write any reviews but felt like I have to with this one - I just went to Scarpetta for winterlicious. Prior to my dinner I've read quite a few mediocre to negative reviews about this place, however I still wanted to give it a try, and I'm so very glad I did!! The key to an amazing dinner at this restaurant is to stick with the signature dishes - i.e. the polenta and the tomato & basil spaghetti. I thought the spaghetti was the most outstanding dish of the night - tastes as good as the best pasta restaurant I went to when I was in Rome, and better than many mediocre restaurants in Italy! I've been to many Italian restos around the city, including Enoteca Sociale and Campagnolo, but trust me, this pasta is the BEST EVER! Originally I thought its silly that they charge $24 for a plate of plain pasta, but after tasting it, I was thinking that I'll definitely come eat this dish again and pay full price, so I can re-live the Rome dining experience without flying there! The polenta was also amazing, with a very strong truffle aroma and was extremely smooth, however I still thought the spaghetti was more outstanding since most food would taste really good if you put enough black truffles in it. For dessert I tried both the chocolate cake and the panna cotta. The chocolate cake was so extremely rich and the sweetness was just right. However, I enjoyed the panna cotta more that night since the two other dishes I had were pretty heavy and the panna cotta was a light refreshing dessert to balance out the meal. My companion had the branzino and the short ribs.. the short ribs were extremely tender but the meat itself was lacking some flavor. The branzino was very good, I especially loved the crispy skin, but the sides that came with it were a bit too heavily salted. To conclude, my biggest tip is to stick with the polenta and the spaghetti - I can't wait to eat those dishes again!"}
{"text":"As others have said- AMAZING!

Have been numerous times and never had a bad meal or experience.  Service and food are top notch.  Scott Conant runs a tight ship- he's my favorite Chopped judge.

Highlights include the spaghetti (yes, it's pricey but worth it imho) and the agnolotti with truffles (doesn't seem to be on the menu at the moment).  On my last visit, I had a special tarragon pasta dish that was out of this world.  The stromboli bread from the bread basket is pretty fantastic too.  Have not been to the other outposts so can't compare consistency."}
{"text":"Scarpetta is at the newly opened Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas and we dropped by on a whim and are glad we did.  This turned out to be a sensational dining experience.  Every single morsel of food that passed our lips was a taste sensation.  We started out with the seared sea scallops, the chestnut soup and the beet salad.  Each was out of this world delicious!  Our entrees consisted of the black cod which was buttery and perfect, the Sicilian spiced duck breast which was tender and tasty and the duck and foie gras ravioli which was creamy and sensational.  We ended our dinner with two desserts and I would highly recommend the Coconut Panna Cotta Guava Soup with Carmelized Pineapple.  Double-yum!  Service was outstanding and although we did not have have a table with a view overlooking the Las Vegas Strip, we enjoyed our comfortable booth with room enough on the table for all the dishes we ordered. I would DEFINITELY want to return to this restaurant again and would highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to come here for our last night in Vegas. We were very excited to try the man who is very particular about his Italian food and couldn't believe how delicious it was.

We started off with cocktails, which is a MUST.
I had the IL Dolce Limone and my husband had the Moscow Mule. Outstanding cocktails.

We were lucky enough to get a seat right by the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. If you're looking for a relaxed dinner with a semi - formal atmosphere, this is your place. I loved the formality yet relaxed environment, and appreciated how friendly the staff was! 

The short rib agnolotti is like nothing else I've tried. Light yet hearty with a bit of crunch and the portion was just right. It's one of those dishes that can get monotone after a while, but this portion is just right to where it doesn't allow that to happen. 

I had the Orecchiette which was also phenomenal. The homemade sausage brought it to another level, although a bit bitter from the broccoli rabe. 

We finished off with the chocolate cake and the strawberry soufflé. They were both very delicious, but I don't think it was anything that blew me out of the water when it came to dessert. Definitely worth trying though! I'm just particular about my desserts.

All in all, phenomenal dinner. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for an early Valentine's dinner. The staff was very attentive and definitely knew their menu. I had the pici for dinner which I found delicious but a little rich and heavy. However, I do highly recommend the mushroom risotto. By far one of the best risotto's I've ever tasted!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try out this restaurant after reading all the positive reviews on yelp. I am also a big fan of the show chopped and enjoyed Scott Conant's snarky remarks. On the show he comes off as a cocky chef who is cocky because he can cook damn well.

Well, all the dishes I sampled were incredibly disappointing. The bread basket was stale. The garden salad that I ordered was soooo overdressed that it was unpalatable. I couldn't taste the sliced beets or even the spicy arugula. It was too vinegary. Maybe a better ratio of oil to vinegar would have improved the flavor. Or no dressing .. .the Caesar salad was similarly overdressed. 

For entrees, my Sig other ordered the marinara pasta with broccoli rabe, I ordered the mezzaluna with basil and ricotta salata. My sig's pasta was a bit too al dente, but it was tasty but not special. The broccoli rabe was absolutely disgusting: it was so over salted that we sent it back. We got another order which was only slightly improved. It also had an aggressive char flavor that was not pleasant. My ravioli was nothing to write home about. It tasted no better than what you could buy at trader Joe's. 

I usually love ordering dessert, but I didn't bother with this restaurant. Scott Conant needs a reality check--ironic that he harshly critiques the dishes of others while his need some serious work.

BTW, the restaurant was way too dark. I love mood lighting but this was ridiculous. Don't waste your money here. Go to beauty and Essex for the soup dumplings or Holsteins, if you are staying at the cosmopolitan."}
{"text":"We arrive five minutes prior to our reservation time and were were told to wait. The bar was full, but no one offered us cocktails or any particular space to wait. This was awkward and frustrating. 
Overall, we were rushed out in under an hour. Dinner was literally waiting for us on the side just as we were done with appetizers. For a restaurant with an extensive wine list, waiter didn't seem knowledgeable about wine and wine was not poured at our table. The Sommelier did not come to our table at any point. Overall, we were made to feel like an inconvenience. As young dinners, we sometimes get a sense of condescension from some staff - this was certainly the case here. We were not there at a busy time, but even if it had been busy we should not have been rushed out. Other tables were being rushed too. Waiter asked several times if were done with our food while I was clearly still eating. Food itself was OK, not great - octopus was very disappointing and lacked flavor. I have had much better elsewhere. 
One positive: the windows in the main dinning area provided a beautiful view of the strip and Bellagio fountains! 
Certainly, an unfortunate experience at this price point - would not return and would not recommend. Service is everything at this price point, and the iteration of Scarpettta misses the mark."}
{"text":"Was so excited to eat here. huge foodie and could not be more excited to eat here. dined at docg 2 times before and loved that restaurant, so was hoping would love scarpetta as well. 

food did not disappoint at all. foie gras and duck ravioli like every one before said was amazing! was completely skeptical about this polenta dish as an app, but I'm sorry for ever doubting this app. it was so creamy and the mushrooms added so much to the dish only the chef would have thought of this. short rib agnolotti with horseradish holy moly. i LOVE horse radish and this was so amazing. brussel sprouts with pork belly were to die for. ppl who cook brussel sprouts correctly are 5 stars in my eyes.  

the reason i gave 2 stars is the service. i almost gave 3 stars but the service really upset me. no spiel of the menu, server was an order taker and not a server. when greeted our table he said \"welcome amigos\" my girlfriend was at the table with my brother, are you kidding me? he had his hands on our 4th empty chair and that is so unprofessional. every server should have his or her own style however, \"amigo\" should not be in any style and laid back with leaning on a chair should not be either. never gave us suggestions, did not check back on courses, huge lack of service when check should have been presented, etc. he did not mark courses with proper silverware until after food was dropped. only positive note about service was the food runners. 2 thumbs up to the food runners, spieled the food, gave us smiles, friendly!!! 

check was dropped as if it was a step of service, not real thank you from server, i still tipped 20+ % but was NOT happy to do so. I'm not expecting to be treated like a king but when paying nearly top dollar and excited to dine in this restaurant i was really disappointed. will not be going back to this restaurant 100% due to lack of great hospitality. 

as stated before 2 thumbs up to the chefs and BOH staff and runners, but to my server, you should probably realize its just not just a paycheck you are collecting, if you want repeat guests you should probably try to provide good service. 

so disappointed, wish i was more happy..."}
{"text":"Came to Scarpetta for an anniversary dinner in February with much excitement after having learned about Scott Conant and his signature dish that shook the culinary world at one point. 

Arrival: We arrived around 7pm and was quickly greeted by the bartender as the hostess was busy seating someone and she was able to smoothly check us in just as the hostess arrived (Both wished us a Happy Anniversary) to walk us to the table. The restaurant itself is dark while the interior modern yet, still upholding the flair of traditional Italian restaurants seen with the white cloths over the tables. We were disappointed that we weren't able to get a seat right by the window but was instead placed awkwardly in the middle. Luckily our server happily obliged to moving us next to a window seat just as a party of two was leaving and his team quickly whisked us and our waters over. 
cia
Service: Our server was friendly and attentive and had a great feel for what type of guest we were. He never pushed items and would passionately explain various items that we had questions on in detail and gave a brief history of certain items that were famous at Scarpetta. He also greeted us a Happy Anniversary and provided a great wine recommendation that my girlfriend loved and the best part is it wasn't the most expensive one but actually matched her description of what she wanted. He was there when we needed him but he also knew when to give us our space so we could enjoy our time with each other. Overall great service all around from our server and his whole team. Also convinced he had a part in convincing the pastry chef for some extra Bomboloni for our anniversary which is an added bonus. 

Food: The best way to enjoy Scarpetta in my opinion is to keep it simple. We found that the dishes we enjoyed more were the simple ones. We started with the complimentary bread which was a variety and came with three different types of sauces which provided a different flair then the typical olive oil and Vinegar (Which is great). 

Starter: Creamy Polenta, we chose this dish based off the recommendation of our server and his explanation that this was one of Conant's more famous dishes. The polenta was rich and provided a feeling of comfort with every spoonful and even more when we dipped our bread in it. 

Entree: Lobster Pici x Spaghetti. My girlfriend got the pici while I went with Conant's most famous dish and crown jewel his simple spaghetti with Tomato and Basil. The magic in the dish is in the noodles itself. I'm a fan of thick noodles and the spaghetti is the perfect amount where it's not too hard but not extremely soft. You can taste the difference in the handmade noodle compared to many other places. Sometimes it's hard for me to go back to eating regular spaghetti after Scarpetta. The tomato and basil sauce is light and not heavy complementing but putting the texture and flavor of the spaghetti in the forefront. Such a simple dish yet just right. My only wish was for the portions to be more but it would take away from the experience. The lobster pici was also delicious but was a stark contrast to the spaghetti as the sauce was more powerful and the addition of lobster helped make the dish more intricate and intense. The touch of almonds gave the dish an interesting crunch as well. We switched dishes a couple times and in the end we both agreed the Spaghetti was our favorite. 

Dessert: Crema Bruciatti x Nutella and Vanilla Bomboloni. The Crema Bruciatti although good wasn't anything impressive and easily forgettable. The Bomboloni on the other hand is the ultimate guilty pleasure (Insane sugar rush as well). The warm nutella inside the sugary exterior coupled with rich vanilla ice cream inside of each Bomboloni is happiness in every bite and regret later on when stepping on the scale. Definitely worth it and the standard amount of pieces is more than enough. 

Thoughts: Our whole experience at Scarpetta could be described as less is more. The simple dishes is what won us over. Our service was attentive when needed but gone to leave us in our own world when it was time. Although we didn't try alot of other dishes on the menu which I'm sure is good we came for the pasta which should be the main focus when coming to a place like this. The dark modern atmosphere provided a great date night as we talked and watched the Bellagio fountains going on in the distance with the entire strip glowing beneath our feet. This is definitely somewhere where you can take someone special as the food is comforting and atmosphere intimate."}
{"text":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!

I just went here for the first time tonight, albeit for Winterlicious and I have to say I was less than impressed. In fact, I would say that the cuisine was bland and basic. If this was 1998 I may have been more impressed but in 2013 I'm expecting much more especially at $100 a person (and that's Winterlicious prices!). 

The beet salad was bland and predictable. In fact, I had a better one two weeks ago at the Crush wine bar for $12 and a show stopping one in Niagara with candied beets and quail egg for $15 that would knock this chef's socks off because it actually included effort in its preparation. The polenta was simply full of parmesan cheese, that's it, nothing more interesting. The accompanying mushrooms were bland. The striped bass was bland and predictable. The organic chicken was better and was the highlight of the meal but still rather bland. The chocolate cake was a joke, anyone with access to Youtube could make that and the accompany gelato tasted like frozen water with flavour i.e. not gelato. The \"cheese\" cake was another joke, it tasted like silken tofu with a few berries on the side. The term cheese was severely misused.

All in all a waste of time and money. Our wine choice was the best part of the meal and even that was botched in that it wasn't the bottle we ordered but the one underneath. As they hold your bottle for ransom they didn't even keep my glass filled.

You'd be better off going to Crush Wine Bar or pretty much any other reputable restaurant in the city for far less money than this place. The atmosphere is nice and it's posh but if you're looking for good food go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"4th of July weekend in Vegas - we thought it would be nuts, but we were pleasantly surprised we were able to make a reservation for Scarpetta. 

We were thrilled when the hostess seated us right next to a window, and no sooner had we sat when the fireworks started over Caesar's Palace! Our waiter was smart enough to know we having a romantic moment watching them and let us be until the end. Shortly after, he arrived and took our drink orders. I believe he was a bit new - possibly a bit nervous, but he had very good instincts and was very nice. Our water glasses did not go empty once and empty plates/glasses were removed immediately. Again, our waiter was not in a rush, but he was not ignoring us either....he really set a nice pace for us for the meal. It was nice to take our time and enjoy the ambiance, which is really a highlight of this restaurant. 

The meal: We're pretty avid fans of the Food Network, and while you'd think the celebrity chefs might be overrated on the Strip especially, I have never had a bad experience with these types of restaurants. This was no exception. The bread basket is to die for....if we knew we weren't going to pay a mint for the meal itself, we might have stuffed ourselves with that alone. Our waiter recommended the spaghetti, which the chef is particularly known for. We decided to split it (they're not snobby about that at this place which is great!) as an appetizer - and it was very good. My boyfriend said he likes my spaghetti better, but I loved it. We had the veal chop for the entree, which we also split - that was very good as well. 

Overall, I don't think our meal was crazy expensive - it was very much in line with the price you'd pay at any other of the strip restaurants. The portions were small, yes, but we also respect not gorging ourselves to death...that's what the buffets are for. 

I can't say what would make me give this restaurant a 5 star rating as opposed to a 4 star...but, I'm definitely willing to go back to find out. Enjoy the Cosmopolitan - it's stunning inside, enjoy this restaurant - the views and food are great, and enjoy each other if you're in a romantic mood - this is the place!"}
{"text":"I'm a big time blogger and I love to give my input on what's hot and what's not. I'm always on the road and I'm never in one place for so long because of my job so a mini vacay was way overdue! My first stop was the cosmopolitan, I've been here a couple of times and I love the vibe coming from the casino, it has marquee which is one of the hot spots in Las Vegas to date, a good amount of shopping stores and let's not forget the restaurants. To name a few you have Blue Ribbon Sushi, China Poblano, Comme Ca, Milos, STK, Holsteins and Scarpetta/DOCG. I've been to some of these restaurants before and Scarpetta \"WAS\" my favorite, the food is still on the top of my list but this time around the customer service was beyond horrible, the worst I've had in my entire life! I came to Scarpetta last year in mid-January 2011, this time they have new employees/managers. I walk to the host stand to check in and no one was there so I waited, then when this young lady arrived she checked me in but had a hard time working her own computer, finally when she gave me the OK can you wait at the bar it'll take just 5 to 10 minutes for your table, I said that's fine even though it wasn't busy. 10 minutes have passed and still no call for my name, finally I reminded the hostess and she goes \"oh yes your table was ready 5 minutes ago\". Instead of checking on the guest this airhead young school girl flirts with the bar back showing off her big breast, while the female manager just stands there letting her go on with her actions. I then tried to speak to the female manager and she turns away like she didn't even hear me. I finally sat on my chair to calm down, I then order my favorite the \"SPAGHETTI w/tomato & basil\", now I have explained to you guys before how this dish is. Scott Conant really put his all into this dish, his ingredients, the flavors, the texture of the pasta everything just works and I can't get enough of it! At the end of the night I did get up off my chair a happy person and the server was awesome but I did NOT leave the restaurant a happy guest, as I walked out to say thank you for the food the female manager again disappoints me. No words, no gratitude she looks at me like my money wasn't good enough, like I wasn't good enough for that place. I was told there's only one female manager so you'll know who I'm talking about when you get there. I swear this lady should get an award for being so stuck up and the worst manager ever! What happened to the old managers? Scott do yourself a favor and fire this woman, she's making your business look bad and as for the female manager, sweetheart you should relax and smile more! I definitely won't be coming back to this location or recommend this to anyone, if you really like the food just have it to go or else you'll feel like an unwelcome guest."}
{"text":"Incredible restaurant! Staff is very friendly and attentive. Sexy, rustic atmosphere feels elegant, yet not stuffy. The best pasta I have ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Had friends in town and decided to check out this place. The atmoshpere is just great from the bar area to the dining area.
Food was great three of us had the pasta and one the lamb. Great bread basket.
Service in the bar was awesome. Dinner service a little slow and server seemed distracted with other tables.
Overall great place especailly for a special night out."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the service and the atmosphere with the nice view. The waiter that we had was excellent with great customer service skills. But the food was ok. I order some white fish and it was ok, I couldn't taste a lot of flavors. I highly recommend for the atmosphere, elegant, nice music with amazing view but the food was decent."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, beautiful decor, awesome wine list, views of the Bellagio fountains. What more could you possibly ask for in Vegas!?"}
{"text":"Last Friday we came in at 9.30. The place was packed and the girls at the reception told us that we could eat at the bar or at the small tables on the opposite side of the bar. We choose to wait at the bar for a table in the restaurant, where it seemed to be more quiet. They told us the wait could be up to an hour, but we didn't really care.

We allready had a few cocktails before we came in, so I started to drink lots of water. We had to share our snack basket (patato chips, nice!) with the people sitting next to us. They shove it to their side of the bar, we didn't steal it back, so far the enjoyment of snacks. 

After about 30 minutes it seemed like more and more people came in without reservation, but they were all given a table in the restaurant. We were still enjoying the bottled water, but after an hour waiting, my boyfriend walked up to the reception and they made our table ready, thanking us for the long wait. When we were seated, we noticed that the restaurant wasn't that full anymore. We were seated at a table apart from the other guest, in the corner of an almost empty room, where it wasn't that warm. They gave us some really nice bread and I didn't want to be snobby, but I did ask for another table. They were very nice and gave us a table by the window, overlooking the B fountains. Not that we especially wanted that, but we did like to sit closer to other people. Experiencing a restaurant isn't just about the food, it's also he temperature, the views, looking at other guest and the over all service.

Anyway, after this, everything was great. My boyfriend and I shared 4 courses, which were all perfectly made: the tartare, the foie gras ravioli, the organic chicken and the goat cheese cake. I was really stuffed (I also had 3 bottles of water) and happy. Service was great, although we were asked a little to much if everything was okay. In Holland we are not used to all that attentiveness.

6 stars for the food, 4 for the somewhat weird start = 5 stars."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just ate here tonight after reading the reviews on Yelp. We requested a window table based on other reviews and glad we did as the view of the Bellagio water show was nice to see at night. The atmosphere is good, nothing amazing. The pasta and sauce dish was very good but beware, portions are VERY small. We didn't have great service either. Our waiter never came over to us once our meals arrived and never came over to us during our meal to check to see how we were doing and still didn't come over until 15 minutes after we were done. Cocktails were ok nothing great. This was our last night in Vegas and wish we tried one of the Italian restaurants over at the Venetian instead."}
{"text":"Beware unscrupulous waiter or manager! Never lose sight of your credit card at Scarpetta.
 
I gave my credit card to Scarpetta'swaiter on 12/31/12 around 11:15pm to pay our New Year Eve dinner bill. 2 preset menus, A la carte filet for my daughter, champagne and generous gratuity. Slightly over $1000.00. So far nothing wrong.
We left the restaurant and went back home. Around  0:05am on 01/01/13. someone at Scarpetta ran my credit card again. This time for $864,--
I noticed the issue a couple of days later. I did call Scarpetta and explained the situation to the hostess. She assured me that the manager would return my call and would certainly correct this mistake. The manager never called me back.
I filed a claim with my credit card company the next day as I did not want to waste my time calling Scarpetta again or drive there to try resolving this error. My credit card company credited back my account right away. However, Scarpetta did resubmit the charge along with apparently supporting documentation. My guess is that the so called supporting documentation is copy of card credit card receipt with some sort of a forged signature). Unfortunately, my credit card company had to re-bill the charge to my account and now I must provide my credit card company with additional information/documentation to support my claim.
Since I must now waste my time supporting my claim, I will also file a police report. I am probably not an isolated case.  BRAVO SCARPETTA"}
{"text":"One of the best meals of my life, with a spectacular view of the Bellagio fountain show. We started out with cocktails & enjoyed the variety of complimentary bread served with citrus olive oil, eggplant caponata & mascarpone butter. We chose the lardo wrapped prawns as our appetizer which were served with rosemary lentils & it was very flavorful. I had the black tagliolini pasta for my entree which was lightly dressed with a cream sauce & topped with dungeness crab, uni & tobiko. I told the server's assistant who removed my empty dish that, had I been alone, I would have licked the plate...it was that good. I lived in Italy for several months & had some great pasta, but never anything that spectacular. My date had the lamb trio which was filet, sausage & chop over ceci beans & baby carrots topped with hazelnut. He requested the chop cooked medium rare but it was served rare. The server quickly took it back for a re-fire & it was perfectly cooked upon its return. We enjoyed the nutella & vanilla bomboloni for dessert which was served with chocolate shortbread crumble & banana gelato. The only issue I had was that our server was a little aloof & cold, but it was late & I believe we were his last table so I understand. It really did nothing to detract from my fantastic experience at Scarpetta & his assistant, guy with a beard & long hair (cute!), made up for it with his kind conversation. Can't wait to return for another meal here!"}
{"text":"We were visiting family in Henderson and my husband and I snuck away for a date night. Friends recommended Scarpetta to us, and oh my gosh. I mean from the service to the delectable food, we were really wowed.  We had a 6pm reservation (which is really early for Vegas) but arrived early and  said we will seat you at 6, but please enjoy a drink at the bar. It was very fancy! We were seated at 6 with an amazing view of the bellagio and fountains. Our server knew his stuff, and recommended the vegetarian pasta with a truffle cream sauce for me, and the New York steak for my husband. We also had the creamy polenta for an appetizer. Everything was amazing!! Oh and the complimentary bread was too!!! Thank you for showing this mom and dad of a toddler a good time Scarpetta!"}
{"text":"Scarpetta is the best Italian Restaurant in Las Vegas. Period. It is high priced but what restaurant isn't on the strip.

Here is the secret: Make a reservation during the early part of the week and order the sampler menu. The sampler is not available during the busy times (Fri-Sun). A word of caution: don't gorge on the bread or you will not be able to finish the meal. Sampler: $90 Wine compliment:$50. I don't remember the exact amounts. 
 
If you drink wine, add the wine for each sampler. You will be very happy with their wine selection for EACH of the sampler. 

Their signature spaghetti is the best I have ever had. There was one dish they cooked up specially for my wife from her previous visit with her BFFs. 

This will be the first place we revisit when we head back to LV."}
{"text":"Had the most amazing experience, thank you so much to all the staff! I made reservations only days before our first wedding anniversary. They gave us the best table in the house, with an incredible view. The entire staff took great care of us and treated us like royalty. It made the entire night one to remember for the rest of our lives. Thank you Scarpetta!!"}
{"text":"For the money, it was the best meal we had in Vegas.  I went with 3 friends for my birthday (sidenote: Las Vegas Restaurants don't really do anything special for your birthday, no free dessert, maybe a candle on the dessert you order).  We split an appetizer, ordered a bottle of wine, and all ordered one pasta.  The bread accompaniments are fantastic!  The Marscapone \"butter\",  citrus infused olive oil, and tomato tapenade are delicious.  Each pasta we had was spectacular.  Then we each ordered a dessert (the coconut panna cotta was the best, light and refreshing, and I'm usually a chocolate person when it comes to dessert).  We had an issue with the check (they presented us with a check, then when we gave our credit card to pay the amount changed, turns out they gave us the wrong check the 2nd time around, but they went back and corrected this promptly) but other than that service was flawless.  We each paid about $60 for a shared appetizer, wine, pasta, and dessert and it was the perfect amount of food (full but not stuffed).  I went to Vegas for a food extravaganza (including going to Sage, CarneVino and Joel Robuchon's) and I would go back to Scarpetta every night if I could do it again.  The food is wonderful and the atmosphere is modern and well-done."}
{"text":"This review is based on a dinner visit.

Atmosphere - 4.5:  From the entrance it's a little difficult to get a sense of the restaurant because you can only see the long bar which you must walk through to get to the main seating area of the restaurant.  I initially thought it was an extension of the DOCG Enoteca, which is next door.  Once you reach the main seating area you will find a nicely decorated dining room that features views of the Bellagio fountains in one direction, and their extensive wine cellar in the opposite direction.

Menu - 4.5:  Great menu with very creative options.  The portions are small and the staff is really good about helping ensure you get the right amount of food.  Of course, as with many fine dining experiences you will pay for it if you are a big eater.

Service - 3:  The service was mixed.  The sommelier was fantastic; he really knew the vast wine collection and helped us find something that paired well with our group's diverse menu choices.  Our waiter, while very friendly, was just way too slow.  It took too long for everything from taking our order to getting our food.   Food delivery timing was off as one member of our group ended up watching everyone else eat while he waited.  I will say that it didn't appear that the other people in the restaurant were having the same experience.  I really think that our experience was out of the norm for some reason.  While I can't in good conscience rate the service experience any higher than 3, I would note that in my experience an establishment with a reputation for good service will usually do things to make amends when they don't deliver.  The restaurant recognized that things had not gone well for our table and took a few items off of our bill to compensate.

Food - 5:  The food was fantastic.  Especially liked the creamy truffle polenta.   

Wine List - 5:  The 3,000+ bottle cellar offered plenty of choices.  The sommelier was very knowledgeable, friendly, and didn't make me feel like an idiot.  

Overall - 4"}
{"text":"Another gem in the heart of Inglewood.  Great service, lots of patio seating.  Not a huge wine selection but decent enough.  Consistently well prepared dishes.  

Had the captures salad to start.  Lots of tomatoes and very flavourful.  Perfect for sharing between 2 or 3.  Next was the seafood linguini.  Nice and light, this was a simple clear tomato broth with lots of clans, mussels and shrimp.  Ordered some fresh bread for the broth. Just perfect.

Modern decor, lots of metal and concrete so not much to absorb sound.  Not ideal for intimate dinners, great for groups.

Did I mention the service?  Great service!"}
{"text":"Pro tip: When making a reservation, request a table by the Bellagio fountains and you won't be disappointed. 

Pro tip 2: Not your traditional Italian restaurant (see menu).  Might be better off with Carbone if that's what you had in mind. 

After our most recent Vegas trip, I've come to realize that a lot of what you pay for the many $$$ restaurants along the strip is the ambiance and the convenience of being on the strip.  The food itself is okay but not mind blowing, or at least not enough to justify the cost.  For that, I feel like you would have to go to one of the many famous $$$$ restaurants.  But who cares! It's Vegas. Scarpetta is really nice because of the view, but the food wasn't necessarily mind blowing.  The break-down:

Fritto misto: My girlfriend and I weren't really a fan of this. Seemed like a bunch of fried shoestrings served on a plate for $18 and not impressive. 
Duck breast: This dish was tasty, but nothing too special that struck out. 
Pici: Yes! My favorite dish of the night.  Very flavorful pasta with an olive oil base and chunks of lobster on top. Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a pasta that feels light and bouncy.

Apart from the food itself, we also really enjoyed the bread selection.  

Overall, despite some shortcomings from some of the food I enjoyed this meal overall.  While I personally don't see myself coming back here, would recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy a medium-high quality dinner who doesn't mind spending a little extra cash for the view and ambiance."}
{"text":"Seeing Scott on tv, I naturally thought he was full of it. Boy was I in for a surprise, the food at Scarpetta was amazing from start to finish. Most restaurants on the strip with with a celebrity chef name are just that - an overpriced restaurant with subpar food living off their name. To start I had the polenta which is to die for! They bring wild mushrooms in a sauce table side and pour it over your dish. As a second course we shared the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti, also highly recommend this dish. Main dish consisted of the prime beef once again delicious. 

For once a high profile chef and restaurant lives up to the hype. Hail to the pasta king!"}
{"text":"Last night my boyfriend and I went for the first time with another one of my friends for dinner, we couldn't have been more pleased! We had Chef Dave come out and talk to us and he offered to just send a whole Bunch of his favorite things out for all of us to try! The breads are amazing, the spaghetti is outta this world, and Chef Dave's  signature dish which is the pink snapper is just to die for ! I wish I could go back again tonight! The food was so perfectly prepared that I couldn't stop eating even though I had no room left to
Continue to eat, I just forced myself to! The wine pairings went perfectly with each dish ! We had such an awesome experience, and at the end chef Dave even brought us back into the kitchen to see where our awesome dinner was created! The kitchen was spotless! Can't wait to go again! Thanks so
Much chef Dave !!:)"}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that just inspires you. You know, like how it inspired me to open a Yelp account just so I could tell everyone what a terrible experience I had. I've skimmed over a lot of positive reviews on here, so I'm kind of shocked by how crappy our experience was.

It earns one star for the solid cocktails (I had a Moscow Mule) and the delicious bread basket. 

The service started out mediocre. We (me and two of my girlfriends) had an 8:30 p.m. reservation and arrived on time, but were still told to wait in the bar for 15 minutes despite seeing open tables. No biggie, we order drinks and hang out. 

We're seated at 8:45 p.m., the waiter greets us, he's surly and disinterested. Who cares, the bread basket has just arrived and is delicious. The bus boy seems friendly and smiles. Everything is cool. Waiter asks if we want sparkling or still water. I say still instead of saying tap, and we get the $8 bottle. Ok, so it was a little sneaky but it's my mistake for not knowing to say tap. But no big deal, still eating the bread.

8:55 - We order 12 oysters, wine, and our main dishes because we've already decided. One of the girls mispronounces her dish, and he gives her a look like she just asked which side Italy was on in WWII. He corrects her, she politely apologizes, and he tells her \"it's OK,\" even though clearly it is not.

9:00 p.m. - The oysters arrive. There are 6 instead of 12 and a bus boy brings them out. We get no description and none was offered on the menu. We plan to inform the waiter about our missing oysters when he comes by again, but I guess he's done with us because he's vanished and does not reappear until we are well into the main course (which is really only 10 minutes later). No matter, we will not be needing any additional oysters as the first 6 were disgusting. Half are covered in red wine vinegar, it's unclear if there is actually an oyster in the shell as I can't taste it. The remaining three have three large chunks of ice carefully placed on top of each oyster, indicating the ice is part of the dish. The problem with having a huge chunk of ice in an oyster is that it makes you chew your oyster multiple times until you realize you are chewing an oyster.

9:05ish p.m. - The main dishes come out. I ordered the short rib agnolotti and my friend had the duck & foie gras ravioli. The descriptions sounded better than the food tasted. The ravioli was overcooked. I can't remember what my other friend ordered as I didn't try it when she said it was also mediocre.

9:15 p.m. - Our waiter materializes temporarily to clear our dishes and to fail to comment on the fact that we've left a substantial portion of our food uneaten. I receive the glass of wine I ordered with the appetizers.

9:20 p.m. - Waiter asks if we want dessert, no thanks, and he drops off the bill immediately. Now he's all smiles.

9:25 p.m. - They take a chair from our table to put together a table for an incoming party of 10, even though there are many empty tables with chairs surrounding us. We take that as our cue, throw back our wine and leave.

The result - we ended up paying over $200 for 45 minutes of so-so food and bad service. I've had worse service before, but never at a place that had the audacity to charge me this much. We also stayed in the Cosmo during our stay and the service at the hotel was pretty lackluster."}
{"text":"Good house made Pasta. Also had the chicken breast, probably most tender and juicy breast i've ever had.

Meal was super expensive though. Really nice place, with a great view of the bellagio fountains, but I don't think i'll be back."}
{"text":"The wife and I were in Vegas on vacation and her younger cousin and his GF were in town the same week so we wanted to take them out to a nice dinner.  I didn't have a chance to check out Scarpetta when I was last here in November, so this seemed like a perfect time.  

The room is absolutely beautiful, and we were lucky enough to get seated near a window, so we could also watch the Bellagio Fountain show at the same time.  I was thinking, this night is going to be perfect right......maybe not.  So the server comes to take our drink order.  I'm a simple guy, so I just ordered a Miller Lite.......he kind of looks at me and is like \" Bud \".  I'm like ok, nevermind.  Can I get a Stella instead?  He's like Yup.  I'm like.... ok.  Then he leaves and the busser brings over the bread basket full of win~!  The bread was a salami roll, as well as some Focaccia, and what looked like some french baguette.  The busser really explained the different condiments they had for the bread well.  He had a thick accent, so it was a little difficult to understand, but he did a nice job explaining it.  He left and our server came back with the beer....a Bud.  I'm like...seriously, I just told you  Stella?  Then my wife's cousin asks him a bit about the condiments (mascarpone, some eggplant tapenade, and some olive oil) and if there is a certain one that is recommended for the different breads.   He's like I don't know, they're all good.  I'm like....seriously?  Then we get around to ordering our Apps and entrees.  We started with the braised shortribs and the fritto misto.....both were great.  The shortribs were very tender and flavorful.  The fritto misto,was crunchy and not oily either.  We then ordered our entrees. My wife and her cousin ordered the Short rib agnolotti, the cousins GF ordered the Lamb loin.  Haha, we could already tell how our waiter was, so for fun, she asked him how the Lamb was.  You would think at a nicer upscale restaurant like this, he would boast about the preparation, or the sauce, or how tender the meat was......nope.  When she asked how it was, he said \"good.\"  Really?  I thought restaurants made money by putting crap on the menu?  Anyways, back to lucky old me.  I asked the waiter about the Spaghetti with Basil (which is what lots of people rave about) or the Stracci.  He was like it's ok, but it's kind of plain.  Not sure if he was trying to upsell me, but I don't know if Scott Conant would appreciate one of his servers calling his food plain.  Anyways, I took his advice and order the Stracci.  Or did I?  Because even if I ordered the Stracci, that's not what was placed in front of me when the rest of the order came around.  I looked at the guy and was like \"didn't I tell you Stracci?\"  Oh, I'm not sure, let me check.  Seriously?  What the hell, can this really be happening.  Anyways, I waited patiently like a fool, while everybody else ate.  To Scarpetta's defense, all the entrees were really good and flavorful, just the guy serving us needed a clue.  We moved on to dessert and ordered the chocolate cake (a bit too heavy for me), the coconut panna cotta (awesome!), and the cheesecake (light, airy, completely delicious).  The waiter comped us an order of Zeppole's for his lack of service, and it too was great.  

Overall, I was just disappointed that the service was so poor.  I was REALLY looking forward to having a wonderful night with family and friends, but it ended up just being ok.  Too bad"}
{"text":"I have to say I indulged in almost every meal in my 4 day stay in Vegas, but this was by far the best. The most decadent, delicious, and just memorable. 

At the tables in Cosmo friday afternoon we were pondering where to have a late dinner before hitting the clubs. The player to my left said Scarpetta had an amazing, but simple spaghetti dish that was to die for. Keeping our fingers crossed, we wandered upstairs around 6:30 and were able to secure a 9:30 reservation and requested a tiny 2 person table in the corner with a great window view. Even though we were running about 15 minutes late, they were gracious enough to hold the table for us. 

Upon arrival, we didn't even have to give our name and check in, the host immediately remembered us from 3 hours earlier and sat us promptly at the requested table. The view of the Bellagio and the water show was fantastic! The only issue I had was that we were not given a menu or even a wine list for at least 10-15 minutes after we were seated. Normally this wouldn't be a problem I presume, but it was 9:30 and we were pretty much starving at this point. 

After we were presented with menus though, the bread basket pretty much had our full attention for a good while. The selection of bread and spreads was DELICIOUS. We literally ate almost all of it...the focaccia was incredible. I ordered a gin and tonic, and my friend a glass of moscato. They were both delicious with our meals. 

We shared the beef carpaccio appetizer, and it was absolutely delicious--just the perfect amount for 2 people to share since we weren't looking to eat a heavy meal, but wanted to try a starter. We shared 2 pasta dishes--the spaghetti everyone raves about and the duck and foie gras ravioli. Personally I absolutely savored the ravioli--i love foie gras and duck, so it was perfect. The Spaghetti my friend liked more--it was simple, but good. 

Definitely coming back here on my next trip to Vegas in May!"}
{"text":"Cold food, didn't deliver entrees at the same time, indifferent attitude. Quality of food was good, but lack of service to match makes this a nonstarter compared to other choices in town."}
{"text":"3.5 out of 5!  Great option for summerlicious! I had the braised beef and the trout as a main. Good portion size. Check out the rooftop afterwards ;)"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here last night. Our server was very knowledgable and attentive. We were celebrating a birthday and were given a table with a nice view of the strip and a free birthday dessert. Food was great and tasty, what more can you ask for?!?"}
{"text":"A business dinner. Server couldn't describe how the frito misto was prepared. The paparadelle was a starchy ball. Asked for a side of pasta, to which the server said she'd have to check with the chef! She came back shortly and advised \"the chef says no.\" From there we rarely saw our server; suspect she was embarrassed. Bottom line: contemporary design; average (though friendly) service; average food."}
{"text":"Had the tasting menu, the ravioli and the spaghetti were very good, black cod was mushy no flavor and duck breast had a game taste. They should just stick with the pasta."}
{"text":"good, pricey but apparently everything in Vegas is headed that way, or so they try to have some class but the truckloads of white trash appear with their bud light. 


I guess its Italian food, which is great but you end up paying a lot for it, and actually what's really out of range is the wine prices , its like 15-20$ a glass. its like jesus !!! It doesn't match the price or class or their food."}
{"text":"The mediocre: Although good, the $24 spaghetti is not really justified by the price. Stay away from that chocolate cake. It's the heaviest, tiniest, piece of chocolate cake I have ever had. It's good, but WAY heavy.

The better: The short rib with farro risotto. Oh so yum! How can you screw up short ribs?

The OUT OF THIS WORLD: The panna cotta with guava soup and coconut ice cream. Very few desserts I eat are memorable. This one is VERY memorable. For a panna cotta, this dessert was extremely light and had just a hint of sweetness (I thought the guava was going to make it super sweet, but it didn't). I would come back and eat here just for this dessert. No joke!

Our service was great. Request a table near one of the windows so you can see the fountain show at Bellagio."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night. We had the mussels which were fabulous! Each of us also had Tagliatelle - one with chicken and black olives in a red sauce (pollo), and one with chicken and spinach in a white wine cream sauce (alla Panna). It was fantastic, the chianti was lovely and the service was perfect! I'll go back every chance I get :)"}
{"text":"OMG GOOD! GREAT date night/anniversary spot. This is a very classy place, I absolutely loved every bite! The staff were extremely professional. I had the Duck Ravioli, delicious! My wife had the Lamb, which i tried and nearly died, SO GOOD. We even had some desert, you have to get the cheesecake, it is topped with mango gilato which does not sound appealing but was phenomenal! We spent $100 before gratuity, did not drink any alcohol. OH, and we had a table watching the Bellagio fountains! I live in Las Vegas, only two other restaraunts rival this one and they are more expensive - YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!"}
{"text":"Great views of the Bellagio fountains/strip, nice comfortable seating, and good ambiance. All the dishes we had were very good, but none were great."}
{"text":"New favorite place in Vegas. Definitely a must.

Here's the scoop: Ask for the booth - #46 (i think). It's right across the magnificent window to watch the fountain show at the Bellagio.

$35 corkage fee. Not bad considering our party brought in a beautiful bottle of cab from Napa. Their adorable great grand master somm Noeh is the sweetest, nicest guy ever. He let us see his most prized bottle. He recommended a beautiful Amarone. Best value for a bottle of wine that's less than $200. Tell him the flavor profiles that you like and he will never steer you wrong.

Titus and the gang (all the crew who helped us) are amazing. Don't like your drink? Tell them what you want. I can't stress that enough. If you know what you want, they'll give it to you. No clue as to what you want? Well don't blame them if you got something that's not good enough for you.

Take your time and enjoy the experience that is Scarpetta. The staff is very courteous and genuine. Food? It's an italian place, so don't complain if the Hamachi isn't like Nobu's. Their agnolotti is divine. It's rich - and a little bit goes a long way.

Think of quality vs quantity. Four appetizers, an entree each and 2 desserts should be an amazing dinner for a party of 5. The food is rich. You will get gustatory fatigue if you try and finish a bowl of pasta with bone marrow and octopus all by yourself. The trio of lamb is tender and well seasoned. Have little bites from everyone's plate. That's when you know that you came here with the right group of family/friends and you're ready to have a great dining experience.

In a rush? Skip this. This is not a fast food joint. Want a big slab of foie? You obviously won't find it in a ravioli."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Scott Conants restaurant since his such a A-hole on Chopped.
He's a particular S.O.B so I thought ; well his restaurant should be perfect.
Well Scott its not. I am  a retired restauranteur and your restaurant had many faults to make our experience a unpleasant one.
The biggest is : we had a reservation at 6 30 pm. We were so rushed for our dinner it felt like they had the table booked for 7pm. We had taken one sip of our Martini and our appetizers were there. We weren't even done with our appetizers and our pasta was there. Then the weirdest thing happened; we had taken 2 bites of pasta and our entrees were ready, they had to bring them back to the kitchen.
2 good things ; wine pairings excellent, and the veal chop prepared perfectly. It had sweetbreads with it but we opted to not have them and it didn't need them.
The worst was the heirloom tomato salad, we had to send it back because the tomatoes had no taste whatsoever. (the night before we ate a American Fish had gazpacho and a tomato app there that our first bite was OMG heavenly)
We didn't have dessert because of our experience with dinner.
Scott you should spend more time at your restaurant training your staff on the floor and in the Kitchen. i will not be going back to Scarpetta. It was not memorable."}
{"text":"this is one of those places that doesn't know how to use expensive ingredients.  Food preparation was on tier with a TGIFridays.  The wait staff was a self proclaimed dbag who \"hung out at XS pool party and hit on fat chicks.\"

the only reason to eat at this place is b/c of the view of the bellagio fountains.  it's a tourist trap, not a culinary experience by any means.  I'd stay away! they're pretty douchy in here.  Manager, wouldn't move us to a table by the bellagio fountains b/c we weren't dressed right, eventhough there were plenty of tables clearing out during the hour long wait for my first meal to be replaced.  No comp, no free drinks, worst $120 spent in vegas."}
{"text":"After reading rave reviews- a bit disappointed. Nice decor - waitstaff was polite but a bit inexperienced. The food runners completely described the food incorrectly  - with confidence though.... Bread was wonderful. We ordered more! Spaghetti with tomato sauce and basil quite delicious and unexpected. I had pasta with lobster - Menza-menza .... Too salty and lobster was soggy and tasteless. The side of asparagus was tasty with an eggy hollandaise-like topping. Other diner had black cod  said it was ok - not great- ordered a green salad- not on the menu - great croutons - dessert was a strawberry soufflé - underwhelming and under baked.. I was not paying the bill but I am so annoyed with restaurants that charge an enormous amount of money for food that is not so consistent or great. 
Hence 2 stars..."}
{"text":"Amazing dining experience! Was here with a group of girls for my friends birthday and we had SO much fun. The service was amazing. Our waiter was extremely attentive The food was out of this world."}
{"text":"Went recently for a friend's birthday.  I had steak tartare and their signature spaghetti.  The quality of the beef was great for the tartare but lacked seasoning.  I've had their spaghetti several times before and it has been getting worse with each visit.  The pasta was over cooked and was mushy.  Shameful!  Al dente is the way to go.  The noodle was also finer in texture than it usually is.  I am not going back.  Especially after they cancelled my reservation once due to a larger event they wanted to book.   There are so many great restaurants in Toronto, if you don't need my business, I will gladly take it elsewhere.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Excellent, friendly wait staff. I'm a bit of a dork when it comes to these fine dining restaurants and they just laughed it off.

The food is incredible. I thought it might be a bit rich for me but it was delicious and even better than I could have expected (and I went in with very high end expectations). 

I'm not a mushroom lover and I was scraping the bowl for every last drop of polenta. The agnolotti was something I could eat for every meal happily. 

The best part was the bill. We ordered a lot. Everyone had an appetizer and an entree and there were several mixed drinks and it was way cheaper than I expected. Yes it is pricey compared to your average meal but for a view of the Bellagio fountains, delicious food, and friendly staff, I would've gladly paid much much more."}
{"text":"I've been here three times since they opened in the early bits of 2013. The menu has grown and the place has evolved a tiny smidgeon. The guys (Rocco and Gennaro) always have a warm welcome for me and they are both intent on creating the best food possible.
To be honest I've only had the Tagliatelle with Mushroom ragu. I order it every time because I love it so. And the calamari fritti.
I love the vibe of this place and if I ever stayed out late I would probably end up here."}
{"text":"So I wanted to try this place just because I have heard about Scott Conant so much and I figured I has to try this tomato basil pasta that is so famous and costs so much. My mom and I got the tasting menu. The famous, signature pasta wasn't the best and there were two dishes that we absolutely both refused to finish because they weren't good. For the price and the hype, I was pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Went there based on the rave reviews, and our table of 6 was frankly disappointed with the food.

I had the duck & foie gras ravioli, and it just tasted off. Very bland, but also the meat stuffing was just not tasting right.

Also tried the spaghetti and it was just meh. I know what Al Dente should be and this was definitely under cooked.

At least the bread basket was good.  Service was just okay.

The place looks great though. That's about it."}
{"text":"Chef Conant is truly a culinary star. The polenta shows that he means business. So often polenta and risotto are served with poor preparation because the average person can't tell the difference. At Scarpetta, they are perfect, as is the homemade pasta."}
{"text":"The food is great and very tasty. The vegetarian Palenta is awesome. One drawback about this place is the service is very slow and food takes forever to come out, so leave your self enough time if you have other plans"}
{"text":"*EYE ROLL* Hostess had us come back in 15 mins or get a drink at the bar \"to be ontime.\" WELL, it was 1/3 empty when walked in on a Fri night.

My fish was awesome! But, my fellow diner/payer was disappointed. Nothing was terrible, just idk, maybe we got the \"wrong things\"? Nothing extraordinary in comparison with other Vegas/NYC estbalishments.

PS View was pleasant - but why is the window sill right on the eye level of the Bellagio fountain?"}
{"text":"Hands down AMAZING!  

Had the 7 course tasting menu ($110 per person) everything was outstanding except the fish was. . Way to fishy, but they immediately substituted it with an additional pasta and glass of wine..

Be ready to relax,  enjoy and be treated like you are an appreciated customer! 

We wanted to just sit back and enjoy our evening and that is exactly what we did!   never once did we feel rushed, the staff checked on us and asked us when we wanted the next course unlike some places that just being it out before you are ready. 

I cant say enough about this place and tell everyone that is looking for an awesome meal to go to scarpettas. .. 

(I should be getting a referral fee!  Lol)"}
{"text":"I'll admit I was a little nervous heading to Scarpetta after a lot of mixed reviews I have read since its' opening this past summer and the Yelp rating wasn't entirely supportive of this restaurant as well. But I am here to help bring up its' rating as I believe this place is a solid 4 stars.

I made a reservation a week in advance for a Wed night (if you don't have reservations for a weeknight, I noticed a lot of empty tables late in the night around 930/10ish). My date and I knew we had to try some of Conant's signature dishes ie the Creamy Polenta and Hand Made Spaghetti. We also tried the Raw Waygu Beef and the Veal Tenderloin. 

So here's the run down:

Creamy Polenta: Comes with a truffled mushroom sauce and this is by far the best Polenta I have ever had, it is just melt in your mouth goodness.

Raw Waygu Beef: This was the only dish of the night where we thought it was just \"meh\" as the true taste of waygu beef isn't brought out very well raw and the nuts and seasoning over power this flavorful meat.

Spaghetti: Magnificent and dense mountain of handmade pasta with the right hint of tomato and basil marinara sauce

Veal Tenderloin: Extremely tender pieces of meat and a dish that all guys (even gals) would truly enjoy.

Coconut Panna Cotta: This came recommended by our waiter and all I got to say is WOW. I'm usually not a huge dessert fan but this is one dish you can't pass up. 

I'm definitely a fan of the food and would disagree with a lot of the harsh critics out there. The service was impeccable and the tables are arranged with a lot of room in between so it's a very happening yet relaxed environment. My only complaints are its' lighting as it's pretty dark inside the restaurant, the hostesses in the front are sort of useless, and the seating is just ok as I started to get a bit uncomfortable near the end of dinner. If you had doubts before just go and try for yourself, I did and I'm certainly not disappointed."}
{"text":"This was the worst Italian meal I have had in a while.  The place has a chain restaurant feel to it, including the menu and food quality. Definitely one of the worst restaurants in Inglewood."}
{"text":"We decided to try a new restaurant in Las Vegas and I'm glad I did. This place has it all..the food, service, View and add a good bottle of wine with great company now that's the way to live. 

I ordered the west coast oysters which are fresh and so delicious and the black cod which is done to perfection. My friend had the spaghetti in which I tried and it was amazing. I'm not a spaghetti fan so that tells you a lot. I also noticed that they have gluten free options on the menu that is rare in las Vegas restaurants. I will definitely go back if the budget allows it."}
{"text":"Hidden on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan, Scarpetta is the place to visit to learn what really good pasta can be like.

As a pasta fiend, I am very picky when it comes to pasta.  Scarpetta has shown me another dimension to pasta that I must learn.  The minimalist approach where pasta is the star, and the sauce or other items are addendums.

Allow me to expound:

Signature Spaghetti: Normally a staple of the American diet, lifted from Italy, it is most commonly served with tomato, carbonara, or meat sauce. Since I make spaghetti at home, I always believed in what I thought I liked.  This dish showed me that a very simple, light sauce can accompany the pasta and \"show it off\" in a way that the pasta shines above the sauce.  A large portion is not required as the fresh pasta is rich and heavy.  The sauce is light, and delicately flavorful, allowing the pasta flavor to come out instead of being more of a \"texture\" experience.  When presented with this dish, one might think \"Where is the sauce?\", but when finished the response will be: \"I didn't miss it\"

Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli:  Again, simple in presentation and execution, the difference is in the details.  I normally don't like duck, and find foie gras to be overly rich and intense when served alone.  The blended filling, in just the right proportion to pasta was a grand pleasure and I will be looking or ANY excuse to have this dish again.  Again, the sauce is minimal at best and the dish relies on the pasta and filling almost entirely to achieve its goal.

Lesson Learned: Extravagant sauces are used to cover up mediocre pasta offerings

Appetizer Bonus: Creamy Polenta with Fricassee of Mushroom: This dish, served in a moderately small portion was a flavor and texture experience that reinforces the axiom that quality is small amounts is the most flavorful, and healthy for you experience.  Having watched its manufacture on the Food Channel, the secret is in the long prep.  Like tamahagane, it must be nurtured for hours (3) to achieve the complete assimilation of the polenta kernel into the dish, resulting in a creaminess of exceptional quality.

All in all, I learned the perception of the Minimalist, the discipline of the Stalwart, and the reminder that food is art in the presentation.

My most basic position:  I will look for ANY excuse to visit Scarpetta in the future.

Sundries:  As with any restaurant of this caliber, service was impeccable.  Even though I dined alone on several occasions, several people inquired as to my satisfaction each visit.  I cannot say enough.  As a lone diner, I felt as attended to as any other party and normally I can't stand eating alone as one tends to get treated like a pariah.  Not the case here!"}
{"text":"Ahhh Scarpetta. I was really expecting the food to be so good, it jumped off the plate, but this was not the case for me. 

The restaurant is beautiful, good lighting, great view of the Bellagio fountains, but not as good as the Eiffel Tower restaurant at the Paris hotel. 

Atmosphere: 
I went with 3 girlfriends and I think the atmosphere was a little bit more subdued than we were hoping. It was a Thursday night, the restaurant was 1/2 empty and was very quiet/tame. We are used to the NYC dining scene, where top restaurants are packed and noisy and give an atmosphere of fun, which is more what we were expecting. 

Food:
-Bread was absolutely delicious! we ate two baskets :) 
-duck Foi gras ravioli: very good, but was a bit too al dente for my taste 
-steak: understanding this is not a steak restaurant, the steak was not flavorful at all. I would at least expect the steak to have some pizazz. 
-wine list: very extensive and reasonable range of prices to accommodate. 

Service: 
- it was good. nothing exceptional. the best service I have ever received is from a Tom Colicchio restaurant - I wish all high end places would follow suit!  

I would probably come back here to give it a second chance, but I am in no rush."}
{"text":"We came here our last night in Vegas celebrating our anniversary. We requested a table with a view of the fountains and we got a great, intimate table. The bread basket was out of this world. We started with the scallop dish as an appetizer, followed by the spaghetti with tomato sauce and duck and foie gras ravioli. The dishes were all amazing, and it was a great way to end our trip. It was one of the best meals I've ever had, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting who wants a special meal."}
{"text":"Yeah, so I can't really comment on other people's trouble with the service, but our experience at Scarpetta was excellent - we were seated right away, and enjoyed very attentive (if not too attentive) service the whole night
But the reason Scarpetta gets a 5 star rating from me is the food - it's incredible
The fact that various media outlets are giving it a 2.5 or even 3 star and suggesting it's not as good as Terroni is a total joke. It's without question in another league. The preparations are way more complex, and the flavours way more interesting
Toronto really doesn't have a restaurant in the same league at this point, perhaps Buca, but otherwise it'll take a trip down to NYC to visit one of Batali's amazing places to beat this one
Hopefully Mr. Conant finds some happier servers to deliver his amazing food to those lucky enough to get in (given all the complaining about how snooty the wait staff is - again, not my experience) because we should be happy we have a place of this calibre in this city, and hopefully more chefs will bring this type of inventive food to our great city!"}
{"text":"This place is simply fantastic, from the customer service to the food. Reserved a table for the Saturday night of memorial day weekend. We had a group of 7 guys and they put us in a private room that had a glass wall separating us from the kitchen, so we got to watch the chefs the entire night. We also had a spectacular view of the Bellagio fountain. The waiter was attentive, but not over-bearing and the sommelier's recommendation were very on spot. 

The food was fantastic. I highly recommend the wagyu tar-tar as an appetizer. Pasta and meats were all cooked perfectly. And for Vegas, the prices are very reasonable. A great experience all around. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour 5:30-7pm at the bar. The restaurant is located right next to D.O.C.G. with a large copper door, but minimal signage so it might be confusing to new guests. I came a little before 5pm when Scarpetta was still closed, and saw a couple of folks wander in to D.O.C.G. by mistake. Service was great, food was excellent. All the happy hour menu items are $7 (albeit small plates)! I had the duck & fois gras ravioli, short rib/bone marrow angnolotti, and pork belly all super great, rich and delicious! Washed it down with a glass of red. As typical with many restaurants here, some food items don't come out until 6pm due to kitchen prep time. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Disappointed...that's the best way to describe my experience at the much hyped Scarpetta, at the beautiful Cosmopolitan Hotel.  Our group of four shared several appetizers, entrees and deserts, but none were memorable.  Portion sizes were very small, and way over priced.  Of the starters, the thimble of steak tartare was tasty, but was only served with three slivers of garlic toast, so one of us got short changed.  The oysters and polenta were mediocre at best.  Our entrees included the signature tomato and basil spaghetti, a short rib filled pasta, and a carbonara style squid ink pasta that was very bland.  None of the main dishes were served very hot, and cooled quickly as we transferred them to our plates.  The deserts were undoubtedly the best part of the meal. The lava style chocolate cake, and the sugar coated donuts were a hit.  The cheesecake had a sour aftertaste.  Service was excellent at Scarpetta, as we were attended to by a flurry of servers.  Unfortunately, good service is not enough to bring me back next time.  If you are in Vegas and want to try a new restaurant, go somewhere else, but stop by the Cosmopolitan to check out the hotel and enjoy a drink in one of the many beautiful lounges."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

I had:
Polenta with mushrooms
Spaghetti with basil
Braised lentils
Gingerbread pear crisp and choc cake

Polenta with mushrooms --- MUST get . 5 stars. Truly outstanding.

Spaghetti with basil --- lots of hype. Yes, it is good. $24 good? Not sure. Pasta is fresh and flavorful, but this is still not a WOW dish for me as other Yelpers seem to classify this.

Braised lentils --- boring dish, nothing special or unique here, made me annoyed with myself that I ordered this given my gut told me it wouldn't be that great. 

Gingerbread pear crisp and choc cake --- both good, but nothing special, creative, or unique here. Standard dessert fare for a nicer restaurant.

Did not live up to the hype. Look it's good. But $75 a person for 3 courses good? Nope."}
{"text":"I own a restaurant so five stars are not easy for me to give!  Great views of the strip and the water show but how 'bout the food?

After doing the math, we decided to go with the wine and food pairing dinner fat $85. for the food and $45. for the wine (about six courses).  If you order off the menu and consider appitizer, entree, dessert and wine, this is at least a push if not a better deal.

Waiter seconded our decision as a good deal and the night began!  Each course of food was presented with a different wine with a short explanation of each.  The flavors were described both before trying the wine with the food and what we should expect after trying it with the food.

The entire meal lasted about two hours and each dish was unique in both presentation and flavor.  If anything, we'd suggest maybe some sorbet between one or two courses for cleansing and maybe take just a little bit more time.  Five or six (we can't remember because even with about a 3 oz serving of wine, that's a lot of grape to consume!) is courses is a bunch of food and even at two hours, it was a lttile bit rushed.

Waiter was very nice, buss service great.  Lot's of corporate types having dinner, I would like to have seen management pay more attention to the guests and the somm never said hello although he was paying tons of attention to an apparient high roller next to us.

All-in-all I would recommend this place to anyone who will listen and also our stay at the Cosmopolitan was fantastic!  Very cool place, great bars, wonderful pools.  Do yourself a favor and rent a cabana, #5 is the best one to get.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am extremely weary of eating in italian restaurants because so many places dont do it well. There is nothing more disappointing than getting a pasta dish done poorly. This place is my favorite restaurant in Vegas.  Spaghetti is worth it.  Polenta is so good although overpriced. Duck ravioli is good. Almost everything on the menu is good. Service is good and its a very nice setting.  Would come back....many times!"}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Italian restaurants in the states.  Not a fan of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, but Scarpetta e veramente delizioso."}
{"text":"Went there for business dinner last night and the seafood (Halibut) and view were fantastic. Jenny, our server was fantastic and we never needed to ask for refills. Only reason this review is getting 4 out of 5 stars is the noise level. You had to lean into the conversation and the lights were flickering sometime despite normal weather. 
Overall I will recommend the food and service!"}
{"text":"Meh!  I have several criteria for good Italian cuisine.  Firstly, it has to taste good.  That being said, everyone has a different take on what \"good\" means.  That is the basis for this discussion.  Although the flavors were savory, there was a lack of complexity.  Expectations for me were also HIGH since this place is expensive.  When you start with high expectations, you are bound to be disappointed.  The signature spaghetti was flavorful, but not out of this world, but again a personal opinion.  The veal was good.  Was it worth the cost? Not in my opinion.  If you take all of the dishes and drop the price by 50%, then it becomes a good Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here this week for a Summerlicious menu and really enjoyed ourselves.

The ambience was very nice - just the appropriate fancy and an easy place to LOL and have a great time with a bunch of girlfriends.

Much to our surprise the portions were generous and filling. The food overall was delicious and the service was qucik and friendly. 

We tried almost everything on the summerlicious menu.
For starters:
Tried the creamy polenta - it was divine.
The braised ribs of beef was nice and tender over a great bed of seasonal risotto - delic!

For mains:
The trout with veggies - it was very tender and beautifully cooked.
The ogranic chicken was unbelievably delicous - i almost wish i had ordered that over the chicken

For dessert:
we tried all the desserts - the chocolate was the best and the lemony dessert was not that great at all

overall, great summerlicious experience!"}
{"text":"From start to finish, the best meal that my wife and I have ever had in our lives! Highly recommend that you do The Tasting Menu with The Italian Wine Pairings!  In particular, The Spaghetti was amazing!  Our Waiter Sato was outstanding!  Scott Conant is a genious; saw him at the bar as we came at 6:30pm on 6/30/15 but he was busy. My wife Dawn and I just want to tell him that it was the best experience that we ever had dining in our lives; thanks!"}
{"text":"I have been to Cinquecento a number of times.  From the pasta dishes to the meat and seafood plates, the food was always excellent.  Service is consistently friendly and prompt.  The decor is a harmonious blend of modern chic and old world rustic charm.  As an added special treat, on the weekend, enjoy romantic classical guitar performers or dj music.  

Cinquecento is definitely a place for not just tasty food, but for a great experience!"}
{"text":"It's-a nice-a! Spiceh meat-a ball-a! *De Niro face*

Now that I've got THAT out of the way, let's talk business here. I'm lingering somewhere betwixt a 3 and a 4 on this one -  but the weird thing is, I've got all positive things to say. But at the end of it all, I just didn't feel an overall enthusiasm towards the place. It's like in the dating world - a person can look good on paper, but sometimes you just don't feel that THING. Well I'm sorry to say, Scarpetta... it's not you, it's me.

The service was splendid; despite having a fafillion hosts/servers/sommeliers/kitchen dudes lingering about at all times, it was never invasive. I'm not used to dealing with sommeliers, so it was hilarious to me that as soon as Tara A started eyeing the wine list, he was creeping up from behind to offer suggestions. And then once he poured the wine, he took it away. Is that a fancy sommelier thing?! \"NO. ONLY I MUST POUR THE WINE.\" I'm sorry, I'm only accustomed to eating at brunch spots. This is all new to me. Not that I minded it - I liked having him be the master of all wine. 

Our servers were deee-lightful and very accommodating. Speaking of accommodating, they have a separate Vegetarian menu! POINTS!! I ordered the Bibb lettuce and Braised Lentils with Rosemary. The salad was meh - I mean, not a cost-effective selection. The lentils were KILLER! Such flavour! Such sassiness! Topped with kale and sun-dried tomato, mama mia!! I tried a bite of my friend's house-made spaghetti with a FACE SLAP of basil - SO. GOOD. I'm telling you: when that plate comes, you're like, \"come on. I could eat twice that amount.\" But nobody at our table finished their spaghetti, cause it was crazy filling.  

I asked for my lentil-y leftovers to go (about 1/3 of a cup) and the lady brought them back in a giant, Whole Foods-sized paper bag. So comical!! 

When the next reservation was waiting for our table, the hostess moved us out to the lounge and brought free glasses of Prosecco (I just typed 'prosexxo'.) Nice touch, and delicious. The lounge is a fab place to sit if you like feeling fancy, free candied almonds, watching dolled-up ladies mack on rich men and some chairs that serve fashion over function. I wouldn't mind hitting up the Thompson every once in awhile - it's very chic, and I think a terrific idea to include 3 eating establishments."}
{"text":"I was very excited to dine here and left feeling like I'd had a really good, not necessarily memorable meal. The best part was the gluten-free menu; that is always easier than \"I don't know, let me check with the kitchen.\". 

We were seated next to the bus station in spite of having a reservation, and there was a table by the window open the entire time we were there. 

The service was excellent, attentive, not obtrusive.

Wines by the glass were good, but as another reviewer mentioned, overpriced.

The food was very good. I had the spaghetti with tomatoes and basil, which many reviews mentioned as \"amazing\". I have a very similar recipe at home that I enjoy equally. The creamy polenta with mushrooms was a great starter. Everyone else enjoyed their meals.

My husband ordered a flourless chocolate cake, which he practically inhaled. There were closed eyes and moans of pleasure with each bite."}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelp reviews.  The food was delicious. The service, not so much. Homemade pasta melts in your mouth.  Thumbs up on the short rib pasta.  Unfortunately, Roberto, our server, was not very attentive to us once the food came.  Had to flag down a bus boy to get our check.  Decided not to give him any more business.  Went across the street to Mon Ami Gabi for my favorite Bananas Foster. Ordered but never received my cappuccino. Guess it wasn't our night for good service.  That is a discussion unto itself."}
{"text":"If you want something more unique than DOCG then come here.

Helpful staff, clean environment.  I was surprised that there was only one stall for this place.  They have an extensive wine menu.

Their bread and their dipping sauces for it were delicious. 

Raw yellowtail was delicious!

Also ordered the
Tuna susci not bad but I would have ordered another raw yellow tail instead of this
Taglitelle 
spaghetti
Stracci 

If I could order one of those 3 pastas again I would pick the simple and very impressive spaghetti.  it's not just your ordinary tomato with basil spaghetti. 


The guava sobert type of dessert was amazingly delicious!  A great surprise for the end."}
{"text":"I have dined at the Thompson Hotel's Scarpetta on several occassions and have found both the food and the service to be fantastic upon every visit.  The staff is always very friendly from the moment you check in with the hostess, and they are extremely attentive throughout the whole dining experience.  In fact I don't think I've been to a restaurant in the city in which the staff has checked in so much with regards to additional needs, as well as asking about how the service is - and not in an annoying way, but more so in a genuine way which really makes you feel like a special guest.

Of all the items on the menu, my absolute favourite is the 'creamy polenta with fricasse of truffled mushrooms'.  The polenta has a very smooth and creamy texture and is absolutely delicious and melts in your mouth.  The presentation of the dish as well as the pampered feeling you get when the waiter spoons the truffled mushrooms into the polenta really makes for a great dining experience.  It's definitely a must, and the appetizer is of a size that it could be shared amongst two people - although I'm not sure if you will want to share after you take your first bite!

The restaurant also offers a variety of delectable pastas of which you can tell from the first morsel that they are all made fresh in the kitchen.  I especially enjoy the 'agnolotti dal plin', which is similar to a ravioli with short rib, bone marrow, horseradish and brown butter inside, as well as the 'duck and foie gras ravioli'.  Although I'm not usually one to order spaghetti in a restaurant, Scarpetta's spaghetti with tomato and basil is like no other - don't be fooled by the size of the dish as it is extremely rich with deep flavour, and is overall quite filling.

There is also a vast selection of meat dishes, including chicken, venison, pork and duck, as well as halibut and black cod.  I have tried the roasted organic chicken, which comes with cauliflower, cippoline and noodles, and found it to be savoury and well-prepared.  

Overall, it is no secret that Scarpetta really takes pride in what it does by paying attention to each and every detail from the presentation of its eye-catching dishes to the rich flavours of its food, not to mention its top notch service.  The bright dining room with floor to ceiling windows also helps create an inviting ambiance which makes you feel at home and want to hang around for hours.  Job well done Scarpetta - until next time!"}
{"text":"We ate there last night with our friends, and we loved everything.  Without getting into specifics, some highlights were the Short rib Angolotti and the Raviolini. The tomato basil pasta is not to be missed. Service was excellent as was the ambiance. This place is not to be missed."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best italian restaurant in Vegas. We are a fan of the black linguinis and the strawberry souffle. Service is excellent and you cannot beat the view."}
{"text":"After making a reservation to dine here with a group of 10 co-workers during the NAB show, we got a call that the restaurant had been bought out and we would not be able to eat at Scarpetta. We were very disappointed, to say the least.

After some back and forth, the restaurant offered to have us to dine at DOCG (their casual restaurant next door) but order from the Scarpetta menu. Not only that, but since it was their error, they said they would comp the food and we would just pay for our wine and other drinks. We were skeptical about the level of food they would offer, but frankly the staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome.

They cheerfully brought us generous samplings from their appetizer and pasta menus and then we each chose an entree. Then they brought several selections from the dessert menu to finish. Dishes were uniformly delicious, and the wine service from Noe and the staff was first rate with a number of fantastic suggestions. 

Our entire team went home happy and the restaurant honored their offer to make us whole. 

We will definitely return the next time a trade show brings us to Vegas and I will seek out the Beverly Hills location, too. Great job, Scarpetta."}
{"text":"We had a party of 11 that stopped in Las Vegas for a short stop and chose the restaurant based on reviews and hype on Yelp.  As you can tell from the number of stars we were less than enthralled  with the food but especially the service.  To start, Two of the appetizers were served cold and on the main course one filet was overlooked and one meal for some reason didn't arrive until almost everyone was finished with their meals

At no time did anyone even come over to ask how the meal was.  Given the owners background and supposed attention to detail it was a total disappointment.   In a town with so many choices Scott conant and Scarpetta have been \"chopped \" from my list of places to go."}
{"text":"Phenomenal.

I was concerned that the famed $24 Spaghetti would be over-hyped, but it was amazing.

I dined at B&B the night before, and was disappointed that they pointed me towards the veggie sides to make my 'entree'.

Scarpetta has a whole menu dedicated to vegetarians - a touch especially appreciated on the Strip.

I booked on OpenTable, specifying that I was veg and that we had a 7pm show to get to (the restaurant opens at 5:30pm).

They had us in and out at lightening speed, and the food was fantastic. Do not miss the mushroom polenta - truffles, vegetable stock, creamy polenta.. the dish is fantastic.

The sommelier made excellent recommendations based off of our meal choices. 

My meat-eating Dad LOVED the salami bread. I was even more enamored by the fact they brought out a separate (meat-free) basket for me to indulge on.

Best meal in Vegas, with fabulous service to boot. It doesn't hurt that you have a great view of the Bellagio water fountains, either."}
{"text":"I know this is an Italian restaurant and we really came here for the spaghetti BUT what blew me away was the bread basket. Yes, something as simple as a bread basket was quite possibly the highlight of our meals. 

I went with 2 girlfriends and decided on one duck and foie gras ravioli, one spaghetti, and one tagliatelle for our meals and a polenta with mushroom fricasee to share. So we're waiting for our food and they bring out the bread basket and some butter, olive oil, and eggplant tapenade. Ok, pretty standard. But once we opened up that napkin, we were pleasantly surprised with stromboli, rosemary bread, and biscuits piping hot from the oven! The stromboli was a perfect blend of crispy outside and soft buttery inside, with the salami and cheese adding the perfect amount of salt. If that wasn't good enough, the rosemary bread. WOW. I absolutely love rosemary though so I may be biased. Anyway, we asked for another basket of bread and polished that one off long before our appetizer even touched down on the table. 

To start, we ordered the polenta with mushrooms and our server told us it was just a small bite meant for one person, but the 3 of us were able to share it without wanting more. At this point we were already getting full! Finally our entrees came and everything was on point. The rich duck/foie gras ravioli, the clean but complicated flavors of the spaghetti, and the fresh, crisp spring veggie tagliatelle. Amazing. You really can't beat fresh pasta. I paired my meal with their pinot noir which was a great complement but I barely even remembered to drink it because I was so enamored with the food. Next time, I may try not to eat as much bread...oh who am I kidding. It's too good!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is located at the beautiful spot. The ambience matches the awesome location. Be sure to ask for a window seat overlooking the Bellagio foundations for a breathtaking view while dining. 

Their food is delicious. The complimentary bread basket comes with a variety of bread, is fresh, warm, also comes with accompaniments. The tomato basil spaghetti was well made. Service was quick and the pasta was cooked to perfection, the spaghetti was sturdy, sauce was creamy with a hint of Basil. The presentation was impeccable. 

I topped it off with the chocolate cake. This was a little disappointing and hence the 4 stars. It was tough and cumbly."}
{"text":"Had the filet. Great service. Nice atmosphere. Great view. Affordable for an upscale restaurant on the strip. Highly recommend for a nice restaurant without having to spend a fortune."}
{"text":"Love Scarpetta!  Snake river rib cap is a must... not to mention you can go up the the chandelier bar and get some great cocktails pre and post.  We brought a baby and it was totally cool. Can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday night for my husband's birthday and it was phenomenal!  The service was outstanding, the food was amazing, and the wine was delicious!  I also want to compliment the lighting and overall ambiance in this place.  I know that's a weird thing to make note of, but it drives me crazy when there is a fab restaurant with crap lighting.  This place killed it in that department -- it was warm, cozy, and romantic (but it's also a great group spot -- there were tons of groups dining while we were there).

The sommelier helped us choose the perfect wine that was within our budget.  It was super earthy, full bodied, and reminded me of being in Italy!  

We had the duck and foie ravioli, the black seafood pasta, and the veal and all were outstanding!  I would absolutely eat here again in the future."}
{"text":"Food was Above average. Ambience was nice. Desert was great! Recommend it. Definitely a birthday dinner spot!"}
{"text":"So had an excellent experience here over a year ago, so came back with my brother and his wife expecting the same thing.

Service: excellent, they were on it and very helpful

View: excellent

Food: so complete mixed bag... 

*got the lobster appetizer... it was adequate, but really not terribly good and REALLY not worth the price

*bread basket was great

*aged steak... complete waste of money.  It wasn't ruined, but ive gotten similar or better steaks at mom and pop shops for 1/5 the price... not terribly good and really overpriced... cooked fine

*spaghetti and basil - still a rock star dish, even though its pretty plain

I am less than impressed than anything beyond the most basic dish is pretty mediocre, probably wouldnt recommend unless I only suggested the spaghetti and basil"}
{"text":"Bread was good, Caponata very salty. Lardon wrapped shrimp tasty, although lentils overcooked (or maybe they wanted mash, either way not great). Polenta was super creamy, and the food runner said  he was topping with truffles, while menu said mushroom fricassee. Either way it was soupy. We had asked about a greens type salad and the server said that a Caesar was an option. Dressing was great, but there was too much. Croutons were at least a week old, stale and gross. The pasta which we were most excited about was not al dente, as promised. The ragu was good, but the dish was just a bowl of noodle mush. Brussels sprouts cooked well, but were missing the promised sage pesto and the walnuts. Also I don't believe they seasoned them. We left them uneaten. Gelato-lemongrass was fine but bland, almond was icy as f. Seems like these acclaimed chefs can't control quality like they do at their flagship locations. Vegas is like the red headed step child. Scott Contant can give brutal critiques on chopped, but he may need to take some of his own advice."}
{"text":"What an incredible restaurant. Definitely come here when you come to Vegas. I sampled the entire menu and there was not a single dish that wasn't incredible. The staff is friendly and curious."}
{"text":"had romantic dinner with the wife. 
we felt over all the place was very good. dinner was nice. location is great. we had couple of drinks before at the bar just outside the restaurant at hotel lobby which were expensive but lots of fun (over $60+ for two drinks each!)

for wise, we had to start the firtto misto, the braised beef and the creamy palenta.
the last two were very good, super nicely presented and very tasty.

with the fritto misto we had huge issues. we take this dish often all over the place and this one must have been way way worse. to start it was 90% vegis that where all cut way too small and where way over cooked...hence they were all falling a part and very oily. we manage to find 2 pieces of squid and 5 or 6 little pieces of shrimp (i.e like 2 shrimps in total cut in 3 pieces each). proportion was way off...should be more like 30% squid, 30% shrimp and 30% veg.....the other 10% is usually some other fish of the day which is always nice to find as well
restaurant people - if you are reading this please please change and improve as it was very disappointing!

for main dish we went with the classic pasta the place was famous for and with bass fish. both were very good. fish was amazing. pasta was good. had to take the pasta cause it was feature on show best thing i ever ate. it was just good but not best pasta i ever had at all. advice would be to skip and try other awesome dish they surly had

we had 2 great desserts. cheese cake and chocolate cake with coffee ice cream both were great (chocolate cake and ice cream was exceptional!)

all in all with 2 drinks the total was some what expensive but we had a great evening.
all the food was very good to amazing! perhaps skip the simple pasta or try another more special sauce but every other dish was amazing with the exception of the fritto misto which was a total disaster!

the only other comment i can make which is not a real comment is that the portions where all a little on the small size. i actually know this is normal in fine dinning places and i have no real issue, however we are certain that if another chef would be serving this portions to the owner on \"chopped\" tv show - there is no doubt scott would say over and over as he usually does.....this is not an appetizer portion size....i wish i had more fish etc etc
we were only hoping he will put a little more of his profits where his mouth is - fyi scott :-)

but a defiantly 4 start and a huge thumps up for a special occasion places.

service and staff were real great!"}
{"text":"Scarpetta was amazing.  We enjoyed the tasting menu, which was quite a culinary tour.  Seasonal vegetables were well integrated into the menu.  Service was impeccable."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner because of the hype. We had a great seat with the bellagio fountain view. (Make sure you ask for that when you make the reservations) thy bring you unlimited variety of breads which were delish. For appetizers the chef made a special dish with foie gras which wasn't part if their menu and it was really good. We also got the yellowtail which was not fishy, and fresh. However when it came to the main course. It wasn't too satisfying. We got the filet mignon which was ok but not enough taste to it and short ribs didnt meet my expectations. However the strawberry soufflé was OUT OF THIS WORLD. BEST SOUFFLÉ EVER!! That's why I have them four stars."}
{"text":"This is a 5 star restaurant by any standard, in any city. The reviewers will tell you to order the spaghetti. The waiters will tell you to order the spaghetti. I know what you're thinking - \"spaghetti? Really?\" Seriously. Order the spaghetti. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I generally don't eat out at very many fancy places.  This is about as fancy as I get.  I came here with a bunch of colleagues from work, and one of the people in my dinner party was a well-to-do doctor who eats here often and knows everyone at the restaurant.  This is an awesome restaurant.  The view outside the panoramic window overlooks the fountains at Bellagio.  It's an amazing view!  I had multiple appetizers shared among my party, a pasta dish as an entree, and several desserts.  Everything was perfect.  I didn't get a chance to look at the bill, but I'm sure it was substantial.  Like several hundred dollars.  But it was worth the experience."}
{"text":"Look - I'm going to keep this as simple as I can. 

I'm astute in the world of culinary arts and have a high appreciation for an incredible meal and the impact that good service and ambiance can have on an evening out.  I also enjoy basic Italian comfort food at times and that's what I happened to be craving on this particular occasion. I found the best of both worlds at Scott Conant's Las Vegas masterpiece. With that being said... We had a slight misunderstanding when we arrived regarding the reservation and our seating preference. The manager was professional enough to minimize any anxieties and made sure we felt that it would be worked out immediately. She sat my wife and I at the bar and proceeded to make us two complimentary cocktails - herself! They were outstanding BTW.  We were seated at the window and enjoyed the Bellagio water show in the backdrop.  The food... it was absolutely the most incredible dinning experience I have had in the last 10 years. We had some of everything on the menu...  It was the equivalent to exquisite gourmet comfort food porn. The wine list is stellar and the service I received was impeccable and personable.  Our server was outstanding - DO NOT believe any negative hype about this restaurant. This is a must for anyone wanting to venture and try something new - Scarpetta will not disappoint."}
{"text":"The faro risotto was outstanding however the white truffle pasta was... Ok, I don't eat truffle very often but cook with it somewhat regularly and the flavor was underwhelming. Great service! The more a drank the water the fuller the glass was! And that never happens"}

We blogged about our dinner:

http://tipsareincluded.blogspot.ca/2012/07/scarpetta-toronto.html

It was an unbelievable dinner. We even had a table side visit from Chef Hunter."}
{"text":"What a great place! We dined with another couple, who had been here before, and raved about it.  We couldn't agree with them more.  Our table had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains -- request that if you can. The ambiance as a whole was quite wonderful -- contemporary and elegant, but still warm and inviting.  Our server was very knowledgeable and gave excellent suggestions when we asked for them. Food was outstanding; we ordered different dishes and shared. The polenta, ravioli, scallops and duck received high marks by all. We would not at all hesitate to recommend or return here."}
{"text":"I have been to Scarpetta twice now... and while the food is fine, for some reason this place is very lackluster to me. The first time I went I was unimpressed but then I wanted the give it a second chance and was still not very impressed. With all the amazing Italian restaurants in Vegas, you can do better. 

I love old school Italian food and all the pizzaz from the other Italian restaurants on the strip. Scarpetta is modern and minimal but the decor is nothing special. If you don't visit Vegas often and have not been to many Italian restaurants here this place seems great. I will say that on a positive note, yes the view is nice but you can get a better view at most of the other restaurants especially in the Bellagio. The pasta is also really great and fresh but overall the restaurant just lacks something."}
{"text":"Steak and pasta were flawless.  wine recommendation was spot on.  You will drop a few bills here, but the quality of the food delivers the value."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had in Vegas or in Italy. The creamy polenta and tomato and mozzarella salad were delightful starters and really set the tone for the meal.  The star was the Pici ..... Lobster with handmade tarragon infused pasta. It was a wonderful balance of richness with just a hint of spice to keep it interesting. This review would be remiss if I failed to mention the expert service. We had knowledgeable, pleasant and attentive servers. Thank you for a wonderful experience. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, ambiance, and service! Fantastic view of the fountain in front of the Bellagio as well!"}

I usually don't go out for Italian since my family makes homemade pasta but Scarpetta always exceeds my expectations. Also there's a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains."}
{"text":"Pasta w basil was decent. Good panna cotta."}

{"text":"Food was YUMMY. We had the steak tartare and the sirloin special.

They must have killed the cow in the kitchen as soon as we ordered because it was FRESH. We ordered medium rare and it was succulent, juicy, and ORGASMIC.

But perhaps the best part of the dining experience (aside from my date) would be the staff. The staff truly makes the dining experience and we felt utterly pampered. Honestly, they would have fed us by hand had we asked. 

The dinner bread was FANTASTIC. I totally nom nom'd on a lot of carbs tonight.

Thank you Christian and the staff tonight for a wonderful dining experience. We will most certainly return :) :) :)"}
{"text":"What an amazing view of the Bellagio hotel. This restaurant is so nice and very romantic with its dimmed lights and wonderful view of the fountain.

Our waiter was very nice and had tons of information to give us about every item we ordered. I enjoyed my meal here and the service was great. I will visit again."}
{"text":"Sincere attention not found in most Casino restaurants.... Food is a dramatic step upon gourmet chain.,,,wine list rivals all others.... View of Bellagio is fantastic"}
{"text":"When it came time to celebrate my 32nd birthday, Scarpetta, it was. I made 5:30 reservations on Opentable.

We were the first diners of the evening, we were seated at a table for two overlooking the Bellagio fountains. However, when the fountain show actually began the we realized the view was quite obstructed from the tall trees surrounding the lake. It was no bother, we didn't come for the view, we were there for the food. 
 
We started with a delicious bread basket, it had a variety of Italian breads and the real treat was stromboli with prosciutto and smoked mozzarella. Citrus olive oil, butter with marscapone and eggplant & tomatoes accompanied the bread. I could've easily made a meal from this, but I ordered the creamy polenta to whet our appetite.

I've heard nothing but praises for this polenta. It was a beautiful dish. Luscious and full of truffle flavor, but it didn't leave me wanting more. 

Next, we opted to skip the entrees and order selections from the secondini portion of the meal. Frank went with the Signature spaghetti. It's been featured on \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" so it's hard to pass it up. I went with the duck and foie gras ravioli. It was the dish that made me lust over the restaurant for the past year. 

The ravioli did not disappoint. It was the second best ravioli I've had to date. Mama Egi's ravioli over at Circo takes the cake. But this was very, very good. Well balanced and the raviolis seemed to melt on your tongue. The spaghetti was good, but hardly a best thing I ever ate. I enjoyed the simplicity of it, the al dente noodle, but $26 spaghetti should knock my socks off, it did not. 

We weren't overly stuffed so we took a gander at the dessert menu and quickly chose zeppole for dessert.

Now, this was special! I'm not fond of dessert oozing with sweetness. This bordered on savory and I love it. These little pillowy bites were filled with nutella and topped with candied hazelnuts. There was a creme anglaise for dipping. It was a perfect end to the meal. 

Service was very good throughout. Our server, Luis, was helpful and he made certain we did not go thirsty. Fresh iced teas were plentiful. The meal set us back $92. Pretty good considering one could easily spend an arm and leg here."}
{"text":"Excellent. It was a great way to start our Vegas trip. Arrived for a late dinner, seated in lounge (still nice). Server very helpful with excellent recommendations. Primi piatti octopus was so good. Scallops very good as well. Artic char cooked perfectly. Husband had the stracci and was the most perfect pasta dish. Was pleasantly pleased with this find."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place. We always come to Vegas and this place is pure class. Phenomenal food and fantastic staff. Allie and Kyle took care of us. Absolutely flawless service and impeccable knowledge of the menu. Thanks for having us!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.

My wife and I spent a couple of days in Vegas recently and based on the other reviews, decided to try Scarpetta.  Despite showing up almost 45 minutes before our reservation time, the maître d' found a table for us quickly, fulfilling our request for a quiet table as we were celebrating a special occasion.  We had a great view of the Bellagio fountains.

Service was excellent as well.  Unlike our dinner at a different restaurant the next night, we weren't constantly interrupted by an over eager waiter.  Our needs were met at the appropriate time but we were allowed the time to enjoy our meals.  Our waiter's recommendation of the Spaghetti was spot on, the house made pasta was perfect, and my wife loved the tagliatelle.

Next time we're in Vegas we'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Place was solid but it would really like to five it 3.5 stars because of the cleanliness of the bathrooms. Doors were busted and place was a mess. Food was good although a little overpriced but hey it's vegas! Had the foie gras ravioli and polenta with mushrooms"}
{"text":"I cant speak for others but the one time i went with a part of 7 we had immaculate service with the finest italian food i have experienced in Toronto.

Absolutely delicious, a little on the pricey side? yes.. but if thats not an issue then go go go.."}
{"text":"Sexy restaurant nestled in the cosmopolitan hotel over looking the Bellagio fountains.  Sophisticated flavors and thoughtful presentation...loved the Pici, Classic Spaghetti, Short Ribs, and Heirloom Tomatoes...the bread basket and accoutrements are to die for...most of all...thank you Jonathan for your impeccable service!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner Monday night.  We did the tasting menu ($110 per person), and we were not disappointed!  My favorite was the duck. . Tender, juicy, perfectly seasoned. Oh and the short rib agnolotti AMAZING! There was a substitution on the fish with a fish sauce that neither of us ate (way to fishy), but they gave us a wine paring to off set,  and it didn't take away from the meal.. great service,  great atmosphere  (ask for a window table ) and sit back and enjoy. ..! Oh,  and our Somalia was outstanding. .."}
{"text":"We had a wine pairing dinner this evening.  We have had them in California and NY, Philly, and Miami.  I was looking forward to tonight's dinner but it pains me to say it was really not very good.  1/2 the time the waiters either barely mentioned either the food choice or the wine pairing.   When asked they were barely able to name the wine or the reason for the pairing.  Severely disappointed overall.  I will give credit to the waiter however.  After about the 3rd or 4th pairing he started sharing his choices for wines and they were better than the choices on the list by far.  I hate ever giving bad reviews, but this one was bad overall.  Sorry"}
{"text":"The ambiance and view of the las vegas strip was amazing! I've tasted so many different spaghettis and the only spaghetti that I've ever liked is my moms and the one at scarpetta. The sauce was just a perfect taste. My sister had the duck foie gras ravioli and my other sister had the Short Rib and Bone Marrow Agnolotti which both dishes were amazing. The food came out in less than ten minutes. The waiters were very attentive."}
{"text":"The bread basket alone would bring me back! That stromboli is amazing! I love salami and bread, so put the two together.....FUGGETABOUTIT!

We had the tasting menu: 

- Duo of Yellowtail and Tuna \"Susci\": melt in your mouth delicious!

- Roasted Sea Scallops, Cauliflower, Bottarga, Chili and Caper Salmoriglio: Sea scallops can be rubbery and chewy if not cooked properly, but at Scarpetta, they were cooked to perfection. They had the consistency of flaky, firm fish and the roasted cauliflower was a perfect pairing.

- Spagetti Tomato Basil - simple and good, but not memorable.

- Black Cod, Caramelized Fennel & Concentrated Tomatoes - The fish was nice and flakey and the tomatoes added a nice acidity to the fish. I'm not a fan of fennel as they are too \"licorice-y\" in flavor for my taste.

- Spiced Duck Breast, Endive, Preserved Orange and Cippollini - DELICIOUS! I love duck, but I hate when its not cooked properly or tastes overly fatty. This was a perfect balance. The preserved orange cut through the richness of the duck. Yum!

- Amedei Chocolate Cake & Toasted Almond Gelato - Toasted almond gelato & salted caramel sauce. SELF EXPLANATORY....IT WAS HEAVEN!

What made this experience special was that the chef brought out a few mini appetizers with every dish served, so it was like having an \"extended\" tasting menu. He brought out:

- CRISPY FRITTO MISTO - seafood, vegetables, artichokes, herbs & lemon
- CREAMY POLENTA - fricassee of truffled mushrooms: By far my favorite dish at Scarpetta. Upon first glance, it looks like it would be too heavy and rich, but it was AMAZING!
- SHORT RIB AGNOLOTTI - brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb.
- ZEPPOLE - nutella center, vanilla sauce and candied hazelnuts. Need I say more?

I loved the ambiance and service of this restaurant. We were seated by the window facing the fountains of Bellagio. A beautiful place to take someone on a date!"}
{"text":"Wow. W-O-W. I live in LA and never been to Scarpetta here. My first experience was in Vegas. Wow. Oops I said it again but it deserves another wow. We were a group of 13 girls and every single one of us raved about the food, service & experience. We had a long big table in the back in a private section of the restaurant. Our waiter was so gracious and patient (again we were 13 girls...). He made sure to explain the different dishes and suggested what he said were the favorites. Before our food came, the bread arrived. I think I would have still given the place 5 stars based on the bread. The salami cheese bread. Holy moly. SOOOO delicious. We shared a bunch of starters. The creamy polenta-to die for. You must order it if you only order one starter. The scallops were also so tasty & yummy. I tried most of the pasta dishes. The short rib agniolotti (sp?) very good with these delicious little horseradish crispies on top. The duck foie gras ravioli were also so good (definitely on the rich side). The spaghetti was great too but not my favorite i've ever had. The seafood pasta also was great. Now onto the desserts. You must you must you must order the caramel creme brulee. Amaaaazing. And the nutella little donuts were great too. I am definitely headed soon to the Scarpetta here!"}
{"text":"Pricey but worth every penny.

The simplest dish at this place is the best:  spaghetti with tomato and basil.  It's life-altering, perfection itself, delicious, amazing, spectacular, love it, want it, dream about it, miss it!!"}
{"text":"Great good, great feel, great service.

Our evening at Scarpetta was a late one, with dinner reservations at 9:30, I was expecting a rushed and lackluster performance. However, my prediction was soon proven wrong.

We arrived and were seated immediately in a comfy booth facing the windows. Our server quickly came to our table with bottled water and began to introduce himself and the restaurant to us. His delivery was smooth and made us feel welcome.

He took our wine orders, brought out the vino and listed off the specialties of the house for the evening. Soon after departing, a waiter came to our table and delivered the first batch of goodies. A basket of treats with artisan baked focaccia, bread with salami and oozing cheese baked right in and a selection of dipping sauces. We quickly devoured one of each and were in carb heaven.

When our waiter returned we put in our main course order of their famous spaghetti and the Short Rib agnolotti. He refilled our wine shortly thereafter and let us enjoy some conversation and spectating.  This place was buzzing at 10pm with eye candy and low-lit cool vibes.

Finally, our main courses arrived. The spaghetti is unforgettable with thick noodles, creamy reduced marinara and a touch of fresh basic. The short rib agnolotti, the little perfectly packaged pockets of braise short rib and hint of horseradish bursted with slow cooked flavor.

Overall, the staff, food and ambiance was something I won't soon forget next time I am in town."}
{"text":"What a fantastic spot! I came here on a Sunday of a long weekend for a second date - it was a great spot that was the right mix of comfortable, stylish and romantic but not too romantic.

First off, the service was great. Attentive without being overbearing, knowledgeable with a few personal touches that made things seem a little more special. The food was delish too! We both started with the Arancini to start (yum) and I had the tagliatelle with chicken - really tasty. Decent sized portions too! There are a fair number of good vegetarian options (which made my guest happy) and the desserts were also yummy.

The only thing I'd change is that they were out of one of the desserts and didnt know until after we ordered - it was too bad because the server had done a great job or talking it up. The other small tiny thing I'd improve is that I could have gone for a second glass of wine - and the server never asked. I didnt really need it though.

Easy to find parking nearby too which was awesome. I'd go back and try out their pizzas next time because they sounded great!"}
{"text":"Went here for my wife's birthday. We had a table where the view is overlooking Bellagio's water fountain. Very nice. The service was awesome and the food was pretty good. First ever restaurant that we encountered where they don't give anything for birthdays. And we have been to a lot of restaurants, go figure. Anything is better than nothing. Left with a sour taste..."}
{"text":"This place is good. Definitely affordable fine dining and I would recommend friends to stop by. Is it amazing and must try? Yes and no. I'm sure there are other Vegas establishments more on the wow factor, but pricewise for food and the experience, yes. Please do visit.

I came here with a friend and were able to request and get a seat by the window that looks over to the Bellagio water fountains. Pretty cool I must say.

The bread. Oh my. They serve awesome bread here! There was a piece of sourdough bread on top of the basket covering two pieces of warm wheat type bread, two rosemary focaccia, and our favorite, cheese and salami wrapped bread!!! This last one was soooooo yummy!! The awesome bread basket came with salted butter, a tomato tapenade, and olive oil. Oh my, we finished most of the bread basket, except the rosemary focaccia and had to ask for a second round of bread to accompany our meal! Yes, that good. The salami cheese bread was probably my most favorite thing for dinner lol.

I ordered the Lobster Pici, which was good. There were large pieces of lobster meat in it! There better be if it costed $38! The pici was cooked perfectly. Nothing worng with this dish, but tasted like something I could have made at home. 

My friend ordered the Ricotta and Mushroom Agnolotti. This was really good. I had a few pieces and the wrapper on the agnolotti was super soft! It should be since they make their own spaghetti everyday.

My first choice for entree though was the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli. Un/lucky for me, my other friend went to dinner before me and had some leftovers, which I was able to try. These little suckers were really good heated up so I can only imagine what they would have tasted like if I ordered at dinner and the plate set in front of me. Drools... So, I would recommend this dish definitely!!

All in all, a really good dinner! The staff was all super professional, accommodating, and attentive. Good job staff!"}
{"text":"An amazing meal! My husband and I decided on Scarpetta for dinner pretty much at the last minute. We were able to make a reservation on-line two hours prior to the reservation. We arrived about 15 minutes early and were sat right away. We were given a table by the window which allowed us to enjoy the Bellagio fountain show (about three times during our meal!). The wait staff was attentive and very nice. They offered advice about portion size and house favorites. Bread is served as you are seated, and it was delicious and fresh. The bread basket even includes Stromboli! Yum! We ordered a bottle of wine - a very good selection to chose from. My husband ordered the duck, and I got the short rib agnolotti with a side of broccoli rabe to share. Both meals were amazing! The atmosphere was modern yet casual. It felt sophisticated but comfortable. We will definitely be recommending to family and friends!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times.They have a nice patio which catches the evening sun. Inside the decor is cool and light with artwork by Calgary artist Danielle Bartlette.   
Our first visits here were good - enthusiastic service and well prepared food. We often order a selection of appetizers - calamari, meatballs, caprese salad; they are all tasty and well presented.
Main courses are pleasant but not  exceptional; the usual pastas and pizzas one would expect at an Italian restaurant.  
Our latest visit was not a success as clearly the restaurant was understaffed. Only one person on duty to serve the whole restaurant, and after waiting too long to be seated and too long again to order a drink we decided to try somewhere else. 
I hope this restaurant can better manage their staffing very soon and I would welcome a new menu."}
{"text":"I loved it here. The atmosphere was relaxed, the view of the strip was gorgeous, and the service was excellent.

I had the casonsei which I highly recommend, especially if you're a vegetarian, and my boyfriend had the organic chicken. He said it was very juicy and full of flavor.

For dessert, we had the zeppole. It was filled with nutella. That's all I have to say for you to know that you should get it."}
{"text":"Oh Scott!! When is the last time you did quality control??? I'm a huge fan of yours as I love the Food Network.  I've been itching to try out Scarpetta for a while and made it a priority during my Vegas trip!!

OMG!  Everything was bad.  I mean bad!!! The service was bad and lacking and the food didn't save the day either.  Let's just say I'd expected much more from you and maybe a meal at Olive Garden would've been a better choice. There was absolutely no seasoning in all of the dishes and the focaccia bread was drowned in oil.  The saving grace is probably your specialty bread.  

We ordered the short rib agnolotti and fritto misto as appetizers and both were mediocre at best.  For entrees I ordered the duck and fois gras ravioli and omg, I couldn't eat more than 4 pieces of it and I'm known to polish my plates.  My hubby had the octopus and it was ok but lacked seasoning again.  My daughter had your world famous tomato sauce pasta and the pasta was tough and needed salt!  Is it a bad day or is it normally like this?

Hands down the worst meal in Vegas.  HUGE disappointment!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to do dinner here with a couple of friends after Yelping the place . The reviews were amazing and the pictures of the food looked very Yummy . I have to admit the  food was really good, but I am extremely disappointed with the service I received. Once we got the first round of drinks we NEVER got asked again if you wanted another round. Until I asked the waiter if he can get us another round . We waited for 40 minutes for our food . What really made me upset was a party of 4 sat literally across from us , and the customer service they received was the total opposite ."}
{"text":"Your typical nice restaurant with nice restaurant prices.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't outstanding in any way. The best thing about it was the view of the Bellagio fountains. Unfortunately, that didn't balance out the overpriced, mediocre food in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great view of the Bellagio fountains. Nice dark, romantic atmosphere. Started with a really great rye manhattan and had delicious pasta entrees. Minus one star for un-exciting yellowtail appetizer."}
{"text":"La pasta perfetto!

Sometimes the simplest things can be magical when executed perfectly.  This is the case with Scarpetta, Scott Conant's debut into the Las Vegas restaurant scene.  

The decor is understated and classy, in shades of black, white and gray.  A knowledgable and unpretentious waitstaff makes the experience all that much better, as they walk you through the menu.  A few tables along the wall rest next to big windows which overlook the neon shimmer of the strip below.  If you're coming here with a small group, definitley request one of these tables.  

Adesso, il Cibo  (Now, the food)

Yellowtail Carpaccio -  Four paper-thin slices of yellowtail treated with fine olive oil and a bit of garlic.  High quality fish and a gentle hand made this appetizer balanced and elegant.

Waygu Beef Tartare - Diced  Waygu beef treated in a similar fashion to the yellowtail, but with a more pronounced garlic note at the end.  Very straightforward and satisfying.

Spaghetti Marinara - As many have said, this is the best spaghetti you will ever eat.  The housemade Al Dente spaghetti is toothsome and tender.  Somehow, the chefs here are able to pull the purest essence of tomato and basil out in this dish.  The simultaneous subtley and complexity of the flavor profile here is truly incredible.  I've spent a lot of time in Italy, and honestly cannot think of a spaghetti that holds a candle to this masterpiece.  A must order!

Black Mac n' Lobster - I believe the black color of the noodles comes from squid ink, but I could be mistaken.  Very nice flavors of lobster and the sea.  The texture was quite similar to the spaghetti, which I found to be redundant, but that was an error in my ordering, and nothing to do with the execution of the dish.  

Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli w/ Marsala Reduction - The food that kings eat!  The ravioli was immaculate, formed with care and the love you'd expect from a homemade Italian meal.  I found the combination of duck, foie gras, and the marsala reduction to be a bit too heavy.  I could see people raving about this dish, but for me it was just too much of a good thing.

Branzino - Gentle white fish with a lightly crisped skin and honest flavors.  One of the best cooked fish plates I can remember having.

Dry Aged Filet - The pink/gray color of this steak is visually contradictory to what you might find at a fine steak house, but that is due to the dry aging process.  It was tender, flavorful, and neat.


Yes the bread is incredible as well, but let's not fill up on bread.  Scarpetta is a great date spot if you're looking to splurge.  Do not leave without ordering the spaghetti, its the type of dish you'll tell your grandkids about."}
{"text":"Wow! I was not expecting to love Scarpetta as much as I did. After a rather disappointing dining experience at Mastro's steakhouse the night before, I needed some Italian comfort food! From the moment we walked in I was in love. I love the lighting and the cozy booths next to the bar looked very inviting and I was hoping we would be sat at one. Thank god we weren't! Instead we were lead into the main dining room which has a perfect view of the Bellagio and Bellagio fountains! We not only had an amazing dinner but also enjoyed the fountain show every 1/2 hour. 

Now on to the actual meal. First of all, the bread selection in the basket are delicious! There was a prosciutto and mozzarella roll that was just to die for! For an appetizer we went with the heirloom tomato salad. Yummy! Next up we shared one of the pasta dishes that was on special. I can't remember what it was called, which is unfortunate because it was outstanding. Next we shared the roasted chicken, also very good! We shared a side of the carrots which were great. The combination of honey and the crunch of the nuts made the cooked carrots really stand out. 

Besides the meal itself, the service was outstanding. Since we shared each plate our server made sure that the items were split onto two plates so that we didn't have to reach across the table to get bites of food. Our water glasses never went below half full and our server was very attentive. 

I will definitely visit Scarpetta on my future visits to Vegas."}
{"text":"Unfortunately it has gone downhill - two stars for service and food - whereas it used to be one of my faves. We had a large party and the chef refused to give us the tasting menu as a few vegetarians weren't interested - Chef said via our server that it would \"ruin the dining experience\" because not everyone would do it. With our dining experience thus ruined by not being able to get the tasting menu, our party almost left, but I convinced everyone to stay because the food had been so stellar before. Which was a mistake. Service was painfully slow. My burrata was good but tagliatelle was just meh. Same mixed experience for the rest of the group. Bread was yummy but even with knowing we had vegetarians at the table, they served the meat filled bread in the same basket as the other bread - just lazy. Only bright spot worth the extra star was the sommelier who made our night with some great wines. We won't return."}
{"text":"last stop on the \"cosmo food crawl \" 

Starting to feel the effects of the crawl but we gotta make a final stop for the restaurant that allegedly makes some of the best pasta in the U.S. 

Again, sat in the lounge area of the restaurant. While waiting for the table, i tried a few of the chips that are complementary at the bar - very good ! had fried basil blended in with some bite to them - not sure if it was red pepper or not. 

While we were virtually ignored at Comme Ca, Scarpetta was the other end of the spectrum ( an not in a good way ) - our server was nice but man, way to pushy on trying to up sell, especially the drinks. 

Went with lighter wine this time - name escapes me but it was a $10 glass - nice. We also opted for some sparkling water - $9. 

Ordered the spaghetti ( $24 ) , the creamy polenta with fricasse mushrooms ( $16 ) and the branzino ( sis wanted the cod but the server almost insisted that the branzino was the way to go - she relented - $26 ) 

The spaghetti was a joy - might be tad bit too strong in basil , but it worked for me. What surprised us was a little heat to the sauce - the server was also a little surprised to hear this ... to the point i don't think she believed us. 

The polenta was extremely rich but dang good. the fricasse was better here than the mushrooms we had at comme ca and helped cut through some of the richness of the polenta. 

The branzino was perfectly cooked, simple seasoning but great taste. nice. 

We went with the amedei Chocolate cake ( basically a molton lava cake $11) with a toasted almond gelato and a salted caramel sauce ( the reason why we got it - $3) and then a separate scoop of tangerine sorbet. 

I tell ya, that tangerine was a heck of finish to our food fest - so frickin refreshing - I will go back for that every time i'm in the building !!"}
{"text":"The best meal I've ever had in Vegas! The server was extremely attentive and the food was amazing. I had the pasta with tomato basil sauce and it was honestly the best spaghetti I've ever had. The servings aren't too big either so we were able to split a dessert, got the strawberry mouse. It was a bit too sweet for me, but still delicious, and the coffee I had with it helped tone down the sweet. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a romantic Anniversary dinner after seeing great reviews by other Yelpers and we were definitely steered in the right direction. 
We had made reservation a week in advance and were hoping to get a table with a view of the Bellagio fountains, though they told us they can't promise and that we will have to try our luck when we arrive. We made it to our reservation on time, yet we still had to wait 20 minutes, which was alittle annoying considering we had made reservations. Though we didn't get a fountain view, we were too hungry at that point to care. 
Our server immediately bought out a bread basket with a trio of olive oil, eggplant and honey butter. THE BREAD WAS INCREDIBLE!!! My favorite was the salami and cheese filled one (I still dream about it). For appettizer we got the MEDITERRAEN OCTOPUS, which was cooked just perfectly! For our entrees we got PRIME FILET OF BEEF and RAVIOLI FOIE GRAS AND DUCK. Though the ravioli was underwhelming, there was lot of ravioli squares which really was great. The filet of beef, on the other hand, was absolutely amazing. It was perfectly cooked and the softest beef I've ever had in my life. This really was the greatest dish I've ever eaten in my life and I was beyond impressed. 
For dessert, we had mentioned that it was our anniversary and were given a chocolate cake with HAPPY ANNIVERSARY writing, which was a lovely surprise. Sadly,. the cake was very dry but the ice-cream helped. 
In all I would highly recommend Scarpetta and would love to come back here for our next Vegas trip!!"}
{"text":"Had high expectations after reading some reviews and friend ref. Food was good but nothing exceptional either. Ordered Brussels sprouts but never got them. Cocktails were extra tasty though and hence that's why 2 stars. 

Our server decided to ruin it for us. Within 5 minutes, decided to tell us that \" I am going to hand over to someone Mr X, and you can tell him your price range\". What made him decide on my price range? Because I looked through wine list and found no cocktails? Or I even hate to say this but I was neither a corporate client nor a rich patron? Give me another good reason to hand me over to a lower staff? After that it was just downhill for me. Give this place a shot if you fulfill their criteria of a good ticket! We were wanting to celebrate a special occasion. Thank you for completely ruining it. I have read similar condescending behavior reviews about this place but didn't want to believe those. Not anymore."}
{"text":"I was in town for a luxury travel conference and after dining at Scarpetta I know that I will send more clients here in the future . The service was amazing , we had a great seat with a beautiful view of the bellagio fountains . 
We had the braised short rib to start and it was melt in your mouth amazing . 
I then had the famous spaghetti and I am a huge pasta lover and this was just fabulous cooked exactly how I love it . 
My husband had the duck and foie gras ravioli . It was very rich but still delicious.
We tried three different desserts and every single one was good . 
I loved this restaurant and I would recommend it to everyone ."}
{"text":"Husband and I are major food show junkies, so we planned to celebrate big for our 5th anniversary. We were seated by a window with an incredible view of the bellagio fountains. The wooden floors, leather chairs, and leather placemats gave an instant upscale but hip vibe. We ordered an appetizer, two pastas, a meat dish, a side, and a dessert. All handmade pastas, the chef was so kind and split all our dishes (even when we said it wasn't a big deal for us to eat family style), and the spaghetti was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. The spaghetti with tomato and basil was so good we got an extra order to eat later. Luis, our server, was incredibly accommodating and made sure our dining experience was unforgettable. He joked with us, told us each item we were about to eat, and sent us home happy customers."}
{"text":"Adequate food, but sketchy impersonal service... We went last weekend to celebrate a birthday with a party of six... No waiter greeted us or identified himself as our sever... Nice bottle of white wine poured during cocktails to get warm... Plates were placed at the wrong guest... One of the orders was wrong and had to be redone leaving the other plates to get cold... Watch out though for the double check... Check was brought to me... I gave my credit card... When the receipt came back to sign it had been run through at $100 more without explanation.... I called the manager the next day... He expressed concern, but did nothing to correct the problem... At the end of the day, seems to be just another case of cynical strip restaurant management... Too bad, we had wanted to check out this restaurant for awhile... Probably should have gone with Milos that night..."}
{"text":"As soon as I had my flight and hotel booked for Vegas I also made my dinner reservation at Scarpetta. Even though we had made our reservation made for 8 on a Saturday night we still waited about 15 minutes or so for our table. Upon getting seated in the dining room I was incredibly impressed. The room was dimly lit, beautifully decorated and facing the fountains of the Bellagio. 

Our waiter quickly approached with our wine and cocktail lists and allowed us to look over them for a while. When he approached again we were still indecisive. We told him what we were thinking about ordering and he made a great suggestion. Now that drinks were ordered, it was time to dig into the bread basket. We loved the stromboli as well as the sourdough and focaccia bread. The eggplant caponata was also delicious. If I wasn't to embarrassed to order another bread basket I would have done so.

After we had ordered we were anxious to receive our food. We started with the shortribs over farro pasta. The shortribs fell apart and were incredibly rich. The farro was the perfect companion to this well made dish. Our polenta was next. It was creamy and topped with mushrooms. Wow. We finished with the home made tagilatelle with vegetables and fava beans as well as guanciale. Being the pasta snob Scott Conant is on \"Chopped\" I knew this had to be good. I was right. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was light and flavorful. Seeing as we weren't completely full we ordered dessert.

And what a dessert it was. The bombolini were basically dougnut holes filled with nutella and a vanilla custard. They were accompanied by a nutella powder and bruleed bananas. It was the perfect combination of textures: The soft doughnuts, the creamy nutella and vanilla custard, the crunchy bruleed bananas and the light nutella powder were out of control good.

Scarpetta is a must for Italian food lovers in Vegas. It's the perfect place for a date night."}
{"text":"Modern decor in dark earthy tones is beautiful. As for the food: Compliments to chef Scott Conant for his NYC location but not this one.  However, with more attentive service and a little less repetitive flavours, Scarpetta, italian for little shoe or small piece of bread used to dip in a sauce could be a good addition to the Thompson hotel.  though still a work in progress. Mushroom fricassee is excellent along with their silky hot molten rich chocolate cake which is a perfect fit in the warm chic monochromatic brown decor.  However the acoustic design needs to be revised: room sounds are loud and brittle."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, and I cannot say anything more then flawless! THis place is amazing.  All the food is purely fresh, and the pasta is homemade which makes it even better.  The decor is beautiful, and their food is just amazing.  Sometimes you have to wait if you want to sit in the main room, with the views of las vegas blvd, but if you sit near the bar its a faster wait for a table.  Their pasta and food is just amazing.  I would go back again and again! It is a little pricey, but so is all of Vegas."}
{"text":"Simply fenomenal! 

It was my second time in Scarpetta, the first one was in Los Angeles, a few years ago!

The pici was fantastic, the service too!

My wife asked for the ravioli, and she loved it!

The dessert was superb! I really recommend it!"}
{"text":"Prices are on the low end, food is excellent. Try the pasta, any pizza special. I've recommended this restaurant to more people than I can count. Great atmosphere. Really reasonable price."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Date night with bf - got a table next for he window with the view of Bellagio water show. The atmosphere was very romantic and calming. 
We ordered the following....
Entrees:
1) Pici, which is with homemade pasta with lobster and chili oil (so there is a kick to it!) $39
2) Special: wagyu Beef was cooked to perfection! The sear and crust on the outside of the beef was seasoned just right with a nice crunch which goes very well with the soft and tender wagyu beef. It was definitely one of the best wagyu beef I've tasted. $70
Dessert: 
We shared the Nutella Bomboloni with homemade banana Gelato (so soft with a slight chewy to the fried bomboloni) $12

It's a must try! Love the homemade authentic Italian flavors."}
{"text":"Wish we could of had a table with a view since we made the reservations months ago for Valentine's Day Dinner with our friends (table for 12)... but besides the less romantic view and unable to split checks for us, which we had to do ourselves at the end of dinner, The FOOD was amazing! ALL MY STARS GO TO THE FOOD one less star for the reservations and bill splitting."}
{"text":"This was for dinner on June 29th @ 8pm.

This could've been a 5-Star review because the food was amazing! Had the Agnolotti with the Short Rib, breadcrumbs, & brown butter, and my wife had the spaghettini their signature dish with the meatballs, fantastic. The bread basket was awesome, but there was one piece that stood out, the bread that was stuffed with Mozzarella and Salami, oh my gosh just amazing.

Unfortunately, the management and our server were so wrapped up with a couple of inebriated gentlemen who I guess deserved all the attention, they catered to there every need.

It's a real shame when this happens because it takes away from a great dinning experience and a memory in which you would've liked to have remembered for your anniversary. Just a note the restaurant wasn't that busy either, so not sure why the low grade service.

Big thanks to the hostesses, as they were so nice to greet us with \"Happy Anniversary\" when we arrived, however our server was nice and attentive, but got so wrapped up with the two gentlemen, must have forgotten it was our anniversary, and just brought our check, and went back to visiting. This accounts for the one less STAR, to bad, the managers that night and or server dropped the ball, I'm sure everyone noticed that was having dinner as well."}
{"text":"I dined at Scarpetta for the first time this evening with high hopes.  I am from New York and have heard good things about the reputation the NYC Scarpetta has from friends.  Being that Vegas is expected to bring the best of the best and be over priced I was nervous taking my parents there when my dad was meeting my boyfriend for the first time.  I am Italian and we take eating meals together very seriously.  I must say that I was not disappointed one bit.  Their decor and ambience alone was impressive.  It was elegant and slightly rustic but not tacky like you see often in Vegas.  From the very well dressed GM Kelli who seated us to the extremely polite food runners the entire experience was definitely a plus.  Having worked in the food and beverage industry on the east coast and west coast I can be a tough critic but I would recommend this establishment to anyone who isn't afraid to spend some money on a good meal.  The appetizers were fairly small portioned but paired with the entree and dessert this place is perfect to have a 3 course meal and be more than satisfied.  I hardly give 5 stars and did not take a look at the wine menu so I can not speak on that.  I will have to return in order to add another star.  Thanks Scarpetta!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times with my husband and we always sit at the bar. Neither food or service has ever been a disappointment. Tonight was no different. Bread basket with Stromboli (1 w/ prosciutto & 1 w/broccoli rabe) was fantastic as usual. Spaghetti perfect. Pici fabulous!"}
{"text":"Love Scarpetta, but the one in Vegas isn't up to Miami or NYC standards. The decor is nice, the service is good. Don't forget to order the famous pasta with tomato and basil, it's amazing always. The polenta is very good as well. Lots of great choices, small portions, and great wine."}
{"text":"i cannot wait to go back!! every bite of the duck ravioli was delectable, i cant describe how good it was. i also tried the berry cocktail which quenched my thirst and gave me the buzz i needed. and let me warn you about the chocolate cake...it's dangerous!! (in a good way)."}
{"text":"Scarpetta is one of my favorite restaurant in the Vegas and NYC area.   Not only is the food deliciously great and consistently delivers quality, the service is five stars rating itself !   My work company had their yearly convention in Vegas this past week and it fell on a Valentine's day. So I thought it would be nice to set something special for my co-workers and I.  I had called to book for their private dinning room about four months in advance. The manager signed me up ASAP. Three days before the dinner I called and asked if they can help me decorate the table and they said yes and so I dropped off a few items to them before hand. Another manager by the name of \"Cheyenne\" took care of the decorations and the results was beautifully done!! I couldn't have done it any better or ask for more.  See for yourself.  And our waiter Steve was hilariously funny as he joined in our jokes.  We had an awesome Valentine's night & dinner!   Thank you Scarpetta staff!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Beverly HIlls location prior to the Las Vegas location and both were spot on. We made reservations and got there 45 minutes early to be promptly seated at the best table in the house! We had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains. Our waiter was very helpful and had great suggestions. The bread basket is always a favorite of mine. I especially like the marscarpone cheese spread. YUMMY!! We shared the apple endive salad with beets also good. I had the spaghetti this time and prior i had the short rib agnolotti (super good). The ambience was top notch as was the service. I'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"I wanted to love Scarpetta, I really did. I was still mesmerized by the striking view I got to take in during the grand opening and determined to prove all of the reviews about the mediocre service wrong, but our waiter left me no choice but to report otherwise.

I want to point out the highlights before I rip Scarpetta to shreds. I came in for Restaurant Week so got the pre-fixe menu and chose the yellowtail, short rib agnolotti, and coconut panna cotta. I thought the yellowtail had great flavor and was presented beautifully. My only complaint was that it seemed to be served a little on the warm side to me which is a concern when it comes to raw fish.

The coconut panna cotta/guava soup was not only delicious but beautiful too. The almost tart soup was a nice contrast to the creamy panna cotta-probably the best panna cotta I've ever had! Not too rich or too sweet, and again, perfectly balanced with the cold fruit soup. I usually don't go for dessert soups, but I'd probably come back just for that.

The view is killer-great front row seats to the Bellagio water show!

Now for the bad.

Strike one: Maybe this is just me being very nitpicky, but the presentation of the short rib agnolotti was just gross. The pasta was served in a wide, shallow bowl and the appearance of pasta in one thin layer with hardly any garnish (save the breadcrumbs which had a nice flavor) was just unappetizing. Also, the pasta was incredibly greasy. I've had pasta in brown butter sauce before that didn't look like that. The filling was good, very rich and flavorful, but the sauce was just off-putting. 

Strike two: for the duration of our dinner, a toddler continuously screamed at the top of his lungs, banged on the table, stood on the booth in which his family was sitting and annoyed the crap out of the surrounding diners. As a fine dining restaurant, it's your responsibility to make sure that the experience is just that, fine dining. Which means if you need to tell this family who cannot control their spoiled infant to beat it, in the interest of preserving the experience for surrounding diners, then do it. After an hour of embarrassing behavior and ugly stares from other tables, the dad who was elegantly dressed in board shorts, shower shoes and a baseball cap removed the child from the fine dining situation. I feel like the management should've handled this earlier, but God forbid they offend one person who is offending the entire restaurant. 

Strike three: our waiter was a dud. I get it, everyone has their off days, but I think this waiter's life was a series of off days. I'm hoping that his service standards weren't lowered because we were getting what was essentially a discounted menu, but I can't help that think this was the case. Discounted menu=less tip? Not always. But if your behavior warrants a tip to match the discounted bill then that's what you'll get. It took about 15 minutes for bread to come out and for the waiter to bring water. Then another 15 minutes for him to take our order for wine. And about another 20 minutes to take our food order. I shouldn't have to flag you down and tell you we're ready to order. That's not my job as a patron of the restaurant. I wasn't in any rush, but those lapses in time mean either this dude was just straight up inattentive or suffering the early stages of dementia. Everything about the dinner just dragged on unnecessarily. He was inattentive and seemed disinterested in our table-there were only two of us and we're definitely not high maintenance so I'm not sure what the issue was.

Our waiter was in no way personable and just rubbed me the wrong way. Maybe we caught him on a bad night. Maybe he didn't feel like we deserved the attention that someone who was ordering off of the regular menu did. Regardless, in these economically unbalanced times, when so many people are opting to eat cheaper or stay home and cook, I feel like the restaurant industry should feel the pressure to give diners the experience they pay for. Even if we were getting your dishes for a reduced price-we are still dining in your restaurant and your standard of service should be equal across the board. You are a fine dining restaurant and I hold you to a higher standard than, say a Denny's. But if you perform like a Denny's waiter, I will tip you like a Denny's waiter. 


I'm not sure I would come back because I was truly annoyed with the service. Maybe I'd come back for the guava soup...and have it at the bar."}
{"text":"Let me first say that I went to Scarpetta just to try their dessert.  My friend and I had eaten dinner at a nearby restaurant in Cosmopolitan and wanted to try another place for dessert.  We first checked out the menu posted right outside the door of the restaurant and figured that the desserts sounded tasty so we should give it a shot.  When we first went in, they asked for our reservation.  We did not have any, so we elected to sit in one of the booths near the bar.  For dessert, I ordered the Peach Crostata since I really like peaches.  The dessert was described as moscato peaches, almonds, cinnamon and cardemom gelato.  It came in a clear glass.  I was expecting the dessert to be very sweet and savory, but it wasn't really any of those.  It wasn't anything extraordinary.  It just tasted like a regular dessert.  I understand that most customers do not come here just for dessert, but I figured with the great reviews and pricing that it would be something worth trying.  I guess I was wrong.  Maybe their food is better than their desserts, but there wasn't anything special on this end."}
{"text":"If the Cosmopolitan Hotel wasn't amazing enough...  This restaurant was great.

The Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli was amazing. The service was excellent and the view of the Bellagio water fountain was grand."}
{"text":"phenomenal - best meal of my entire life.

I consider myself an \"entry level\" foodie - i love food, but have not had the opportunities to try an extensive amount of high end dining. That being said, I've eaten at some top notch restaurants in  the US and Europe and this is the best overall meal I've ever had.

Should also add we were fortunate to get the corner table overlooking the belagio, which was really nice. Ask for it if possible. 

 We ordered:

Appetizers: Scallops, beef tartar
Pasta: Spaghetti, Duck Foi Gras Ravioli
Entree: Duck, Veal chop
Dessert: Bombelloni

The all stars of the evening was the beef, raviolio, and bombolloni. I rate each of these a 10/10. beef may be the most flavorful and delicate dish I've ever eaten (easily trumps what i ate in France). The ravioli was absolutely amazing with the perfectly cooked pasta and a smooth liver flavor on the inside.

We actually ordered the mousse for dessert, but our very attentive and friendly waiter suggested we go with the bombelloni instead. We trusted him, and glad we did. Hard to imagine eating donuts from DD ever again.

The other dishes were all perfectly cooked, but flavor wise they all earned an 8/10. 

Staff was excellent, atmosphere romantic, and food top notch. Highly recommended - thank you Scott Conant!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, wine was outstanding and the service was even better! Do yourself a favor and splurge on dessert, the cheescake was incredible!"}
{"text":"I always order the same thing when I bring someone new here. My go to menu options never fail. Start off with the mushroom polenta (sex in your mouth), share the duck foie gras ravioli (it's pretty rich but amazing) and believe it or not the spaghetti! I've never ordered spaghetti at a restaurant until now and I'm hooked! I even got the recipe and make it at home now! I also like the short rib risotto and the short rib ravioli :)"}
{"text":"I'm not one to typically go to the strip to have dinner. IMO a lot of places on the strip under deliver and overcharge. Don't get me wrong there are several good places that the meal fits the price. Scarpetta is one of those places!
I came here 2 years ago. I was on a date w/ my gf and I wasn't feeling well. So much that I didn't eat very much on that visit. Last month we did that date night all over again. She has always been a fan of Scarpetta. 
Scarpetta is looked by where the Bellagio fountains are. So if you can manage to make a reservation, request a table by the window to get a dinner and a show. However if you don't, the amazing food will certainly make up for it. 

Pici - lobster, preserved tangerine & bottarga (OMG! OMG! SO GOOD!)
Spaghetti - tomato & basil

She said she always gets the spaghetti. It's basic, but it's oh so good. She's right, it's SO GOOD! She mentioned that she hasn't ever had a bad experience at Scarpetta.

The dimly lit dining room is perfect to get lost in. The staff is 5 stars, they are certainly knowledgeable. Very good vibes.

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate husbands birthday and made reservation for three. There does not appear that a reservation is needed given the many open tables when we arrived. I was bummed that we can't get a window table to view the bellagio fountains because those are all two tops. 

Anyhoo the food was not spectacular and didn't blow me away. In light of all the raving reviews and food pics I had high expectations but it was somewhat of a let down in reality. Husband ordered the spaghetti and it was good but not like omg. I ordered the fried squid and it was also decent but the portion was very small. We shared a salad and shared our main entrees with our 7 year old since they don't offer kiddo menu. She wouldn't have been able to finish a meal by herself we thought so we shared but in light of the small portions she would've been just fine. It came to about 100 benjamins and we left feeling like we can still eat so we got dessert from the milk bar. All in all I would say this was an okay experience but I wouldn't be itching to eat here again."}
{"text":"Ok, so my husband and I went t Scarpetta last night for dinner to celebrate our anniversary.  I would give the restaurant 4.5 stars if I could, it was a very good experience.  However two of the dishes we ordered were less than stellar, so that's why my rating went to a four.

I give the staff 5 stars, they were prompt and courteous and seated us at a fantastic table right next to the window so we could watch the Bellagio fountain.

We ordered four dishes and split them all.  They helpfully divided the food onto 2 plates for every course - much appreciated.  We started with the seared scallop, which was excellent.  Then we had the tagliatelle with vegetables.  The pasta was great but the veggie sauce was extremely salty, and I couldn't eat it.  Then we had the pork chop - an amazing dish, a real winner.  But we ordered the mixed mushrooms to go with that.  And though they were fresh and nicely cooked, they were flavorless.  It didn't seem like there was any seasoning on them at all, very disappointing.  We split the orange soufflé for dessert, and that too was fantastic. So all in all it still was a great meal, and dining experience, and we would return to try again.  The good dishes were outstanding, it's too bad the other two weren't up to par."}
{"text":"Was staying at the Wynn and the concierge recommended this place.  We were a party of 12.  The food took forever to come out and the service was terrible.  The food was excellent though.  Was it worth the wait?  NO.  The Hotel \"scene\" itself was awesome."}
{"text":"We ate here for Valentine's Day last year and loved it. Part of the dining room has a view of the Bellagio fountains and made the evening a little more special. 

No problems with any staff and the whole restaurant seemed to operate very smoothly even though the restaurant was packed for the holiday. 

Everything we ordered was fabulous and we really enjoyed ourselves. This was a fun and intimate dinner and I'd definitely go back here another time."}
{"text":"Dark, sexy, and intimate.  Delicious Italian fare with excellent service and a view.

I've dined here multiple times and Scarpetta never seems to disappoint.  My dining experiences have ranged from a two-seated table with the view of the Bellagio fountains to the private chef's table with the view of the kitchen.  I've had the typical a la carte menu to the seven-course tasting menu.  If I had to choose my favorite experience between them all, my personal preference is the two-seated table with the a la carte menu.

The service here is very prompt and attentive.  From the Managers to the wait staff, service is priority here.  Shout out to Kelly, the General Manager, as she personally knows how to take care of her customers.

To start off the meal, you are presented with a one of my most favorite bread baskets ever.  The three accompanying spreads are vey unique and delicious. Their stromboli bread is sinfully good.

My personal favorite dishes:
-  Roasted Sea Scallops:  Simple and well executed.  My only complaint is the size of the portion.
-  Spaghetti:  Simple, clean, and classic.  FYI, the pasta is al dente.
-  Risotto:  Slightly al dente, yet creamy at the same time.
-  Tagliatelle:  Comforting dish that is full of flavor.  My personal favorite.
-  Fennel Spiced Black Cod:  Flaky yet bold in taste.

If you are looking for a restaurant with a sexy ambiance, delicious food, and excellent service, come to Scarpetta.  It's my personal \"go to\" spot for dinner dates."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere fitting for group night out, intimate enough for dates and business dinners alike. Beautiful view looking out to The Bellagio. 

We ordered:
Primi...
Yellowtail sashimi +++++ (more please!)
Tomatoe mozzarella salad ++++
scallops +++++

Pasta...
Spaghetti ++++ (pasta is made daily in house)

Secondi...
Spiced duck breast +++ (a bit chewy and star anise overpowered the duck just enough to make it not as enjoyable)

Finished the meal with Napoleon creme brûlée, and it was just divine.

I had a light Bordeaux(?) which was absolutely divine with the duck. It was one our waiter recommended so other waiters may know as it may be chef recommended.

I will absolutely come back. In fact, I feel like checking out the one in NYC now!"}
{"text":"This is the best food that I've eaten all year. I couldn't get enough of the  foie gras ravioli and scallops. The cocktails were perfect. I have nothing but great things to say about this place."}
{"text":"Really was looking forward to this dinner. We had an excellent table and the service was amazing. Great wine list!!  Unfortunately the food was very mixed.  The ravioli got rave reviews, but the spaghetti (which was highly recommended by the waiter) was bland and tasteless. Will give this another shot....but wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I have been curious about Scarpetta.  The Thompson Hotel has been a gathering grounds for the hip and beautiful for the past while.

It so happens, I ended up buying a Travelzoo voucher for a 5 course tasting.  I wasn't sure what to expect.  I don't often buy Groupon/specials for restaurants but this one turned out to be a great buy! 

I made a reservation on a Wednesday night.  When you enter the hotel, the lobby is upbeat, modern, and lively with a bar by the couch area.  We were able to check our coats and enter the dining room.  We were the first ones seated since they just opened at 6 pm.

They seated us by the window which is nice for looking outside, but there are also these insanely annoyingly bright pot lights.  Lucky for me I had a giant purse and blocked the spot light.  I didn't want to feel like I was performing while I was eating.

The service was very attentive and pleasant.  We were offered water right away and provided with the wine menus and bread.

The bread basket included four types of warm fresh bread.  The salami bread was like mini salami sandwiches, which were really yummy but filling.

The amuse bouche was a cheese taster... literally you can have a small taste of Parmesan and another nondescript cheese. 

The five courses was chef's selection, so we didn't know what we would get.

Our first course was the popular creamy polenta with truffles.  
It was definitely standout.  The polenta was so smooth and wonderful.
Along with the polenta, we were also served the shortribs which were tender and fall apart soft.

The pasta course was huge.  The Spaghetti was simple with tomato sauce and basil and perfectly cooked.  I ate some but I wanted to eat more ravioli and left half of my spaghetti.

I loved the duck and foie ravioli!  We didn't leave any of it behind and it was a large plateful.  Savoury, sweet, and fatty, one of the richest raviolis I've ever tasted.

The fish course was sea bass.  It was lightly seared with crispy skin.  A bit salty and served with earthy vegetables.  

The leg of lamb was perfectly cooked and nice and pink without runny juices.  I was so full at this point I'm sure if I was paying as much attention to the food.  However, the lamb was well prepared.  It wasn't transformed into anything creative, but I thought it was well executed.

As for dessert, they served us the cheese cake and caramel budino.
The cheesecake was deconstructed with two types of crumble to add flavour.
The budino was a bitter caramel with peanut butter and chocolate brittle
I preferred the cheesecake.

At this point, I thought I was going to burst at the seams.  We left completely full and satisfied with our meal.

We had a fantastic meal and it was definitely a pleasant surprise considering I had purchased the tasting menu with a voucher (they add 18% gratuity automatically and wine is expensive, so it's still not a cheap meal but worth it).

I'm sure I will be back.  Also, I'll have to visit the bar or the rooftop patio!"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant to go to when I come to Vegas. I usually get the tasting menu, because you get a little bit of everything. I love any Italian restaurant that uses handmade pasta. Love the ambiance here as well. I've gone here two nights in a row before to host business meetings because I favor this spot. Delightful that it's right inside one of my favorite hotel casinos, Cosmo."}
{"text":"I made reservations for 6 people at 10:30PM through the yelp app. It went smoothly!

We ordered:
PICI: it was lobster and pesto pasta (all pasta is made at the restaurant)
RIBS: SO GOODDDD. Full of fat! :)
HALIBUT W/ ARUGALA: Delicious, perfectly made. Beware, there was only ONE peice of arugala as an embellishment.
And two other orders that I can't remember. But everything was delicious!

PROS: The restaurant provides a view of the Bellagio water show.
Huge wine selection. Delicious food. 

CONS: Can't find one.."}
{"text":"I love Scarpetta!  Especially their Branzeno with a fish broth and crispy skin!  It's a shame they changed the way this dish is prepared.   Their ambiance and decor is beautiful. Service is always great as well.  Their polenta and mushrooms is a must try dish.  I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The service was horrendous. The hostess didn't smile, wasn't polite, and was visibly overwhelmed. The food made up for it. Everything we ordered was amazing; cheese plate, ravioli, lamb ragu fettuccine, strawberry shortcake... AMAZING! My advice to you, patience! My advice to the manager, hire more servers and a better hostess!"}
{"text":"I came yesterday to celebrate my birthday with my boyfriend I made reservation 2 weeks before that to make sure we will get a table next to the view...and the lady on the phone said \"she is not promising nothing and I told her it is very important to me if she can do that. Of course we came yesterday the table wasnt next to the window but when I look at the tables next to the window you can see people come inside the restaurant ask for a bable next to the window and get it....nevermind about it. The host is American but all the waiters are Mexicans,  I do not have problem with that but you Hardly can Understand what they say or when they talking between them you don't understand Because they Speak Spanish,  I Find it rude and not respect the place. When we seated a waiter come to us and ask if we want a bottle of wine,  we says \"no\" and he brought 2 glass with water and that's pretty much ends our relationship with the waiters. after that come waiter brought brad and started to explain about the brad and left. We couldnt understand a word he say. After 15 mins come finally our waiter and ask what he want to eat I told him what I want and told him the only reason I choose this restaurant because I saw you have here vegetarian menu because my bf is Vegan, so the waiter brought him this menu and left we needed to wait more 15- 20 mins until he came back to the table, and then when my bf told him what he want to order the waiter say that all the pasta made with eggs in the vegetarian menu so he can't order any pasta !!!!! After we waited 20 min !!! And after he choose something to eat! You don't want to know what he ends with! After a while when the food  came the waiter comes to me few time to ask if I finish to eat and 3 times I said no. After he took the plate he didn't offer us dessert menu he just left to different tables and ignor us for good!!! After another 15 min I needed to call him for bring the check he didn't say nothing he brought it and gone!  Very disgusting treatment , the food is actually good! But the treatment so bad! I swear I never come to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Short rib marrow stuffed tiny ravioli's = ridiculously good.
Spaghetti with marinara and basil = amazing; perfectly al dente.

Strawberry soufflé maybe one of the best deserts I've ever had."}
{"text":"The boyfriend has been pining for this restaurant after hearing about their amazing spaghetti. Also, after finding out that the man behind the restaurant is a judge from The Food Network's Chopped, I was sold.

The food did not disappoint. We had the yellow tail as an appetizer, then the famed spaghetti and the sirloin. We decided we were going to share everything and the kitchen was actually nice enough to split each dish so that it was presented on two separate plates to us. Each plate looked exactly as it would if it were the full portion. To top that off, they didn't even charge a splitting fee like so many restaurants usually would! That is what I call spectacular service. 

I'm a sucker for bread and their bread basket had me half full before we even ordered! The bread filled with salami and cheese was the favorite. It came with 3 dipping sauces, a marscapone cheese, tomato with eggplant, and a citrus oil. I thought the best combination was the citrus oil with the tomato and eggplant. 

The yellow tail was fresh and had a nice chili kick to it. There were small chunks of rock salt that added a little crunch. It came with 4 slices of yellow tail, which was actually more than we expected.

The spaghetti lives up to its reputation. It was beautifully presented, swirled up into a pile and they uncover the plate right in front of you. The sauce is perfectly seasoned and the tomatoes still have a slight acidity. The pasta itself is cooked al dente and they're beautifully thick spaghetti noodles. I had to eat this one noodle at a time so I could make it last as long as possible. 

The sirloin was cooked to our liking, but it was a bit chewy. We both loved the vegetables that came underneath it. There were carrots, mushrooms, potatoes, and probably some others and they were all so good!

At the last minute, we decided to get the amedei chocolate cake with the almond gelato and salted caramel sauce. The gelato was my favorite part of the plate, although it looked partly melted by the time it got to the table. The chocolate cake was like a lava cake, where the middle is still fudge like. It could have been warmer. I thought the plate could use more of the gelato and almond gelato to balance out how rich the chocolate is. Also, the bf ordered a coffee and it came with refills! 

One complaint is that we were seated along the wine fridge and someone would come by every once in a while and just open it up behind us. Having the chilled refrigerator air interrupt a nice meal isn't the most fun. But if you are seated by the window, there is an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains.

For the price, it was actually a good amount of food and it is quality food. I really cannot wait for the spaghetti again. When I eat my jarred Preggo tomato sauce, I'll be fantasizing about the spaghetti here."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Excellent well-thought out Italian fare. 

However, when dining at high-end restaurants, I expect a similar level of service. Tonight our server was mediocre at best. Barely checked on us at all. Never asked us if we would like anything to drink besides water. The kicker was serving half our party their desserts while the other half didn't even get to order dessert. Then, they proceeded to clear all the plates and served the other party their course afterwards. 

I also found it interesting that the server only addressed the man at the table and never the woman. Too bad for him, it's the woman who paid the check tonight and decided on the tip! It's the 21st century. Our party clearly wasn't out on a romantic date where it might have been chivalrous to only address the man. I suppose misogyny is alive and well at this establishment. 

Sadly, the service here used to be excellent but has clearly gone down the tubes. I wonder if Scott Conant realizes his restaurant is not keeping up the same standards as in previous years."}
{"text":"Warning, this beautiful restaurant is in the Cosmopolitan which is a pretentious somewhat tacky casino/hotel. Except for the hostess, who seemed a little  \"too cool\" for the guests, the staff gets an A+ for service. Titus was our main waiter but there were two other gentlemen who were on the spot and very kind.  We had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains as well. The warm bread basket with a variety of breads (foccacia, stromboli, etc) was served with a 3 different types of dips (an eggplant thing, olive oil, and butter) and they were all so delicious. We started our meals with a shared Beet salad and polenta. To say the polenta was AMAZING would not give it enough credit. It was creamy and consistent, topped with truffled mushrooms, garlic, and sauce. The serving was large enough to share. I could have had another serving of the polenta and been quite happy and full. The beet salad was crisp and came with a generous serving of gooey cheese (stracciatella), pumpkin seeds and balsamic dressing.  It was fresh and tasty.  My friend and I shared the Duck and foie Gras Ravioli and Short Rib Agnolotti. My friend loved the Ravioli and loved the marsala reduction. I felt the duck and foie gras had a weird texture and I didn't care much for it. But that could have been a mental thing since I have opinions about foie gras practices. The sauce was delicious however and perfect for dipping some bread into. I wasn't sure what to expect with the Short Rib. It was small rib pieces in noodle wrapping covered with breadcrumbs (?), brown butter and horseradish. Whoa the horseradish was strong but so delicious! If I hadn't filled up with polenta and bread, I could have finished my plate. It was so delicious. But if you find horseradish to be strong or can only tolerate a little, skip this meal! There wasn't any room for the dessert. But the options looked tempting. Oh I forgot we had Moscato de' Asti that complimented the meal throughout. The price seemed fair for the quality and service. One of the most delicious meals I have ever had."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that hasn't been said? The food was amazing, the service was phenomenal, and the atmosphere was absolutely gorgeous.

I booked my reservation through Open Table. We showed up to our reservation roughly 15 minutes early. I gave the hostess my name and thus the amazing dining experience began.

I started off asking my waiter what he would recommend for a cocktail that I couldn't get anywhere else. He immediately recommended a drink that had bourbon in it. I'm not a bourbon fan, but I decided that I should give it a try. I cent remember the name of the drink, but it was the first one on the list of specialty cocktails. What I experienced next can only be described as an orgasm in my mouth. It was absolutely amazing. 

My dinner date and I shared two appetizers. We had the octopus, which was good but a bit flavorless, and the scallops. The scallops were unreal. Absolutely awesome. Also, he bread that they bring you with the baked cheese inside of it is great as well. For our second plate we shared a lobster spaghetti plate. Once again, phenomenal.

My dinner date had lamb and it was great. The meat absolutely melted in my mouth. I had some sea bass that was also very good.

Overall, for two appetizers, 3 drinks, a pasta plate, and two main courses, the meal was less than $200. We've been to Barelotta at the Wynn, and while this might not be the same caliber of food, the price comparison makes this place phenomenal."}
{"text":"This is Scott Conant's restaurant at Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. The pasta, as one would expect from his restaurant, is great but so is the entire menu. That's why we usually have the tasting menu to see all the variety. Get it with the wine parings and experience the full range of cuisine."}
{"text":"The food was great, small portions and for non-organic food it was way overpriced. Our bus boy provided great service in contrast to our waiter. I tipped the bus boy. The desert was the best part."}
{"text":"My addiction started when my friend introduced me to their New York location 3 years ago. Since then, I am absolutely adamant about visiting every time I'm either in la, nyc or Vegas. I even planned a work event at the Vegas location because I love it so much!! 

I typically stay with the pastas on my visits because while the proteins are all solid, the pasta is something hard to get anywhere else. My absolute favorites are the spaghetti, short rib agnolotti, and polenta. I've had their prime  rib carpaccio and that is divine but I think was a unique special of the night. 

Until next time Scarpetta, I'll see you on my Yelp pages late at night during my next random craving. 

Love you Scott Conant."}
{"text":"Scarpetta is located in the Cosmopolitan in Vegas. My wife and I went to see Celine Dion (amazing btw) and headed here for dinner. As per usual in Vegas we were late after the show ( over 30 min) however they accommodated us very quickly on the Windows over looking the The fountains at Bellagio. The food was good, Italian, small plates. The desert was good and they had a good wine list. Pricy however it's Vegas. I would recommend this place next time you are in Vegas, great staff and great service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.

Location isn't a huge factor to me.  As a local in Las Vegas, I avoid the strip when at all possible.  That being said, being sat at a window overlooking the Bellagio fountain show is a nice view to see (no matter how many times you have seen it.)

The server (Joe) was nice, funny, and informative.  He knew how to sell without selling.

First off, bread.  With a place called Scarpetta, you should expect great bread... which they have.  One of them has salami in it, and I was happy just eating that.  The bread came with olive oil, a tomato chutney-like sauce, and a pesto.  All were great, but the olive oil blew me away.  I enjoyed it so much, I bought a bottle.

Appetizers, I got the \"creamy polenta\" which turned out to be the creamiest polenta I have ever had.  It was served with mushrooms and was amazing.  My date had the roasted sea scallops.  The service size was a tad on the small size, but she seemed to enjoy it nonetheless.

Onto the Entrees.  I'm a Food Network addict, and saw Scarpetta while ago on \"Best thing I ever ate\" where they talked about the Spagetti with Tomatoes and Basil.  I had it, and it was good.  It wasn't the best pasta dish I have ever had, but a solid 8/10.  The pasta is fresh, and had a great texture to it.  The sauce was heavy on the basil (a good thing,) and there wasn't a ton of it weighing down the dish.  Next time I go, I'll try something different.

My date had the Duck and Foie Gras Ravoli.  She seemed to be very much enjoying it, and let me have a bite.  I then understood why Scott Conant is looked at as this great master of Italian cooking.  This dish was outstanding.  I might just get this next time I go.

Lastly came dessert.  I was informed there was no Tiramisu on the menu (my favorite Italian desert,) so we looked at the menu.  Our server recommended the Coconut Panna Cotta.  My date got that, and I got the Crispy Sweet Risotto Crepes.

The only downside to the meal, I would have to say is the Risotto Crepes.  It isn't that they were bad, it is just that they were more like Taquitos than crepes.  They were little rolled and fried pieces of batter with a sweet risotto in the middle of them.  For the amazing meal we had up to that point, it was a letdown.

My date's Panna Cotta, however, was fantastic.  It had that light and fresh taste that you want after eating a lot of pasta.

I will definitely be going back, I'll just get the Ravioli and Panna Cotta instead."}
{"text":"Was looking for a nice restaurant to eat at that was near to Vdara, good but not super pricey. This place fit the bill nicely. We had a 9:30pm reservation and was seated on time. The place was about 50% full. The service at the start was incredible but tapered off towards the end of the evening when they swapped out waiters on us. Wait staff however all very knowledgeable about the wine and the food. I started with Octopus which was delicious followed by the lobster pici. The pici was very nice indeed, tasty and pretty rich. The pasta itself was very dense and cooked al dente which took a little more effort to eat than perhaps it should have. It was a good size portion. I had a cheesecake for desert but at that point was too full to really appreciate it's intricate flavors. My wife started with the lobster salad which was also excellent followed by the Branzino, again delicious. Modern décor with a chilled yet sophisticated ambience. I wore a jacket but pretty sure you could dine here in a t-shirt if you wanted to. We dropped just over $300 for the evening including a modestly priced bottle of white wine. If this wasn't Vegas I would say it was not worth that kind of outlay. Seemed a little overpriced. But who knows."}
{"text":"I have been dying to try this restaurant for a while, hearing all About their special  spaghetti really had me hyped. Of course as soon as I got a reason for a celebration I choose Scarpetta. It was honestly underwhelming. I was expecting the food to be out of this world but unfortunately it was lacking in flavors. I got their butternut squash soup with lobster to start with and found the flavors to be very odd paired together. They were not complimentary to each other. We also got a steak which was good. Short rib pasta was great as well. Although very greasy. The service was great as expected from a 5 star rated restaurant. I liked the atmosphere. It was modern and seductive. Sadly, with so many Italian restaurants in town Scarpetta will not be the first on my list to visit."}
{"text":"First 5 star review of the year means it was that good, folks.
We had the filet mignon,veal chop (cooked medium plus), cauliflower and mushrooms. The flavors were incredible and well balanced.
Not to mention the portions were great for the price.
The views are amazing (ask to sit by window).
Ambience is romantic and sexy.
I would recommend you come here. It did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I was slightly disappointed with the food here.  From all the reviews I read, I thought that the pasta here was going to be exceptional. First off, let me state that the waiter I had was absolutely great and the view of the Bellagio and the fountains was fantastic as well.

Since none of the appetizers sounded appealing to me, I decided to order two pasta dishes.  I first ordered the spaghetti.  On the menu, it simply states \"Spaghettti-tomato and basil.\"  As I started eating it, I realized that it was actually spicy and felt my lips burning.  Given that this is their signature dish, I expected to be blown away and I was not.  I feel that if the food is going to be spicy, they should let you know-this spaghetti certainly had more to it than simply tomato and basil.

The next dish I had was the Stracci-which was their seafood pasta dish that on the night I was there included crab, shrimp, and lobster.  The seafood was laid out on top of thin ribbons of black and yellow pasta.  While the seafood was tasty, I thought the dish was somewhat unimaginative.

Between these two pasta dishes and the bread that came out, which was fantastic, I was full and had to skip dessert.

Would I go back to Scarpetta?  Probably not, especially when considering there are so many fine restaurants in Las Vegas and the fact that with tax and tip, I spent close to $90 just for one person.  At the end of the day, I thought that the food was good but I just expected a bit more."}
{"text":"Superb service, great food. 
There are so many choices in Las Vegas it can be overwhelming. We wanted to try Scott Conant's Scarpetta because we had heard it was very good. We made reservations and arrived on time. They were just opening and we sat at the bar and had a drink. The bar is gorgeous and the bartender was very friendly. 
After we were seated and ordered drinks they brought us a really nice bread tray. I recommend the salami and cheese bread as the best of the bunch but everything in there was superb. The marscapone butter was a nice touch. 
I ordered the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms for an app. Super dish, and creamy really does describe it. I could make a meal out of it. 
For my main course I had the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti which are like mini ravioli's. It was very rich and savory. The bread crumb crust on top was crispy and added some texture. Don't let the term bone marrow scare you it merely adds a depth of flavor. 
For dessert my wife had the flourless chocolate cake with homemade gelato. There was nothing wrong with my coconut panna cotta, a custard like dessert but after tasting her cake i wish I has ordered that as well. 
All in all a great meal at a reasonable price. I would definitely go there again on our next rip to LV."}
{"text":"Food was amazing as expected!  Coconut Panna Cotta with Guava was Devine.  Wine list was way overpriced, but it's Vegas right?  Still gets 5 stars because overpriced drinks in the newer Vegas spots at just the way it is!"}
{"text":"I have dreamt about eating the spaghetti here for years. For years. And when that spaghetti and I finally met and dined together, it did not disappoint. The spaghetti noodles are cooked to an al dente. Rather than the spaghetti sauce poured on top, the noodles are simmered and cooked with simple sauce. The starch from the noodles holds onto the flavors bringing together the noodles and sauce. The spaghetti here is divine.

In addition to the spaghetti, our table also shared the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms, the braised short ribs of beef, and the raw yellowtail. All of which were equally as good.

The service was subpar. Our table had to constantly flag our waiter down. For a fine dining establishment, I felt like we were jipped. On top of the inattentiveness, my friend encountered a shard of plastic/glass in her salad. Lemme tell you, whatever she bit into was hard. HARD. Everyone at the table felt it and indeed, the shard was tough and hard. We sent the dish back to the kitchen and the chef simply said that we were mistaken and that shard was actually just a piece of hard sea salt....uh. Okay. Clearly that piece of salt sea did not melt in my friend's mouth and it was HARD. Sea salt my ass.

The food is good, but go to the one in Beverly Hills. This place sucks. And maybe they cater toward out of towners who don't know any better, but for the vast majority- we know what fine dining should look and feel like and this certainly is not it."}
{"text":"Had dinner here by myself yesterday.  It's very elegant, I had a table with a view of the Bellagio.  I had the spaghetti, they were delicious. The wine selection is top-notch and the dessert (Strawberry souffle) was great. Service was also very good."}
{"text":"Duck foie gras ravioli.

Really, the review could start and end with just those four little words. I mean, really, what else do you need to know? You're going to sit down, you're going to order that, you're going to enjoy it because, believe it or not, it's better than it sounds. And you're going to leave a very happy person.

OK - I guess a little bit more is in order.

I've been here three times now, and not once have I been disappointed. But the absolute highlight has to be the dinner for my 40th birthday.

(Yes, I know - cliché to visit Vegas for one's 40th. Don't judge. It was a blast!)

In any event, we made a reservation for 10 of us. That managed to land us in one of their private rooms (which I didn't request, mind you) overlooking the Bellagio fountains. That right there was enough to make us all feel like rock stars. And, as an added bonus, we got to control the lighting and music volume in the room (I really don't like the music they play there, but it's easy enough to tune out.)

The service we received was absolutely impeccable. The waiter came along and explained the entire menu to us, calling out the highlights. We did an appetizer course of our own mix and match - just ordering a bunch of stuff off the menu, including the above mentioned duck foie gras ravioli so everyone could have a taste. For my entrée I wound up going with the lamb, which was out of this world spectacular - probably one of the top lamb dishes I've ever had.

The couple of little gripes I have - the wine menu is very expensive. I don't think there's much in the way of a bottle for under $80. The music (which I mentioned above).

Next time you're in Vegas and wanting a great dinner, this is an absolute must visit. It's a must visit for me every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about the views of the Bellagio fountains, but I didn't think that they were that great.  We got a great window table since my friend is in the Vegas business, but the view is more of a side-view.  Nothing spectacular.

And the food was just ok too.  I guess their specialty is the Stromboli that is included in the bread basket.  Meh.

And the rest of the dinner was pretty forgettable also.  The place has a nice vibe, but overall, I would say that I wouldn't go back.  They do stuff the tables and chairs in, so it's kind of cramped."}
{"text":"First off, I would have to say Scarpetta's service is impeccable.  If we could just rate our waiter alone, we would give him a 5 star rating!  He was knowledgeable, friendly, and humble.  I have seen far too many waiters in Vegas who don't care, or are extremely snooty because my husband and I look young even though we're not.  

As for the food, we order the scallops as the appetizer, and the duck and foie gras ravioli and the spaghetti as our entree.  For the scallops-I feel that it was good-but I have had better.  The duck and foie gras ravioli is their stand out dish!!  The wine reduction and marsala sauce on top of the ravioli made it so delicious.  The actual ravioli themselves are shaped like triangles.  I can tell there that is this delicacy to the outside when they were making it.  The duck and foie gras inside is very unique, and not like anything my husband and I have tasted before.  This dish deserves a 5 star.  Finally, for the spaghetti.  I was extremely excited to try this dish because I read all these reviews on yelp explaining that it was amazing.  However, we were a little disappointed maybe because we were expecting so much.  Don't get me wrong-the pasta is still good.  However, it's not the amazing that it was made out to be.

Overall, if I could give Scarpetta a 4 1/2 stars, I would.  My husband and I will definitely be back if when we go back to Vegas."}
{"text":"The final meal of our Vegas escapade was well spent at Scarpetta. It wasn't completely perfect but most of the night made up for the little missteps (we'll get to that later) so for the most part, I had nothing but a good time. Attentive service, rich indulgent food, all housed within an intimate space with gorgeous views of the Ballagio fountains, we closed our trip in pure hedonistic style.

We started with some of their signature cocktails as we browsed the menu. Upon the recommendation from our fantastic server, and the joys of libation, we decided on the tasting menu ($99) and accompanying wine pairing ($49) since several of the dishes that we wanted to try were on it anyway and boy did we pick right. That was the beginning of six courses of pure pleasure.

We started with a sashimi plate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=YvhgCFf5CQSIopYC83uWwA) which consisted of yellowtail with a drizzle of ginger oil and red onions. The other half of the plate sat the tuna susci - tuna wrapped marinated vegetables. The fish was so fresh and the flavors were delicately balanced. The bread basket came shortly after and there was a nice selection including yummy foccacia and stromboli. As part of the tasting menu, the chef also threw in a couple of surprises and we were treated to a delightful seafood fritto misto for this course. Perfectly crispy fried but not oily, every bite was yummy and the rock shrimp just melted in my mouth.  

The next course was a perfectly roasted sea scallop. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=06QYvnXBie8HfTnYKN4OBw) It was a joy to eat and the velvety salmoriglio sauce was a nice accompaniment to the sweet and juicy scallop. The chef's extra this course was a polenta with a truffle mushroom stew. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=gtRWGpR4xggHmw0rVryaNw) For the record I hate cornmeal and thus hate grits, tamales, and polenta. Yet, I could not stop eating this polenta. The flavors of the mushroom stew combine with the impeccably smooth polenta. (I suspect there's a whole lot more butter in it than what Chef Scott Conant lets on) It was a nice double headliner with the scallop. 

Next up was the pasta course and Chef Conant's signature tomato & basil spaghetti. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=JQRLJQ4G8BgIzxS0bC8Bow) Fresh made pasta in a simple tomato basil (+ quarter stick of butter) sauce but just perfectly executed. While I thoroughly enjoyed it, the chef's extra this course, the short rib agnolotti with brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=wzfcOlEkTVylois628h_Ag), totally blew my mind. Wow who would have thought that the combination of short ribs, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs could be so sublime? I miss it already as I speak. 

The next course was the black cod. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=2TmOcEavT5T4aeu8J6ItRA) Again perfectly seared but wonderfully moist in the middle. The fatty fish absolutely stands out against the sauce and caramelized fennel. Delicious. The next entree course was a the duck breast. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=BR1FRH72URaVJtrhiq6w-A) While this was my least favorite dish of the night, it was still absolutely delicious which tells you the quality of the food all night. The orange and spices (I kept picking up 5 spice) worked well with gamy duck. All in all, a successful combination. 

Final course and dessert was a chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and caramel. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=uDi5aPZQgQwUQcGjVUkoSg) This is where I really had to throw in the towel after all that eating. The chocolate cake was really rich and decadent and I could only finish half of it but I just couldn't let the toasted almond gelato go to waste. It was just delicious. You can totally taste the toasted flavor. 

Now on to the kink of the night. Since we were seated by the wine cellar, the sommelier came by several times to retrieve bottles of wine. Each single time, he let the door hit me as I was eating without even acknowledging it, much less apologize. Not that it was a deal breaker but you expect a little more basic courtesy especially when you're dropping good money on dinner. 

Still for a wonderfully decadent meal paired with friendly and attentive service, we had a good time and I strongly recommend Scarpetta if you want to treat yourself to a fine meal on the strip."}
{"text":"Our party of 4 came to celebrate a friend's bday based on a recommendation. All reviewers who had previously mentioned about the great view of the Bellagio fountain is correct. Though, you'd get a much better view if you were a party of 2 seated right by the window, of course! 

Service was great! Our server gave great recommendations and the other wait staff were fantastic! They kept bringing basket after delicious basket of bread with that citrus-infused olive oil and refilled our drinks constantly!

We ordered the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms to share, duck and foie gras ravioli, pan-seared escolar with sun chokes, American Wagyu rib cap and a lobster pasta  that was the daily special. The polenta was AMAZING!! We shared it but I was ready to order another for myself. The polenta itself was so fine that it added to its creaminess and then topped with the truffled mushroom sauce added to its heavenliness! All our entrees were delicious (as evidenced by the fact that nothing was left behind), except the  lobster pasta. While I enjoyed the fresh and sweet lobster and LOVE the freshly made chewiness of the pasta (think udon in terms of thickness), the combination together with the sauce was not incredibly tasty. It almost resembled a lobster bisque type sauce and I think it made the dish too \"seafood-y.\" Hands down our table's favorite was the American Wagyu rib cap - WOW!!! The meat itself was incredibly tender and so divine that it just melted in your mouth. Even without the sauce reduction that accompanied it, the beef was naturally flavorful and worth its price tag. You don't get much but, you definitely get a phenomenal piece of meat! As for the ravioli, like others have mentioned, it was a bit on the salty side and even before our order, I mentioned it to our server and he gladly told us that the dish can be altered to fit our tastes. The escolar, not on the menu, was perfectly cooked and just as juicy and flaky as fish should be - delicious! 

Overall, the order came out to be a bit over $200 with 2 iced teas, 1 appetizer and 4 entrees. It was well worth the deliciousness that filled our bellies, the unique experience of being in such a gorgeous atmosphere and great service! I would visit again in a heart beat and save my $$$ for the next special occasion."}
{"text":"Very Impress with the wine sommelier he went out of his way to show us how fresh the Colorado Lamb was. Great place at a great price. If you like Pizza, Pasta and Lamb this place is worth the visit."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant.  Rounding my 4.5 stars up to 5.

Sexy ambiance.  Lovely, low lighting and a fabulous view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip.  

Absolutely beautiful service.  Our server and every runner and busser were friendly and classy.  Attentive but completely unobtrusive.  Perfect.

The delicious meal started with their bread basket.  All of the breads and accompaniments (mascarpone butter, citrus olive oil and caponata) were great, especially the Stromboli.  That was certainly a nice surprise!

We started with the Yellowtail which was well-seasoned.  I loved the little crystals of flavored salt.    My guy had the Stracci, a wide, flat pasta served with seafood.  Very delicious and simple.  I had the foie and duck ravioli which was pretty amazing.  Both dishes were very light on sauce, which I enjoyed.

The desserts were very good as well.  Man-friend had the chocolate cake with almond gelato.  Very tasty.  My mocha cheesecake was absolutely delicious.

Great restaurant for a sexy date."}
{"text":"Great ambience and food! The only thing holding me back from a 5-star review was our aloof server who never seemed to be present when we needed him, and when he was present, wasn't very interested in our dining experience. We started with the risotto balls and meatballs - fantastic!! Pizzas were tasty, as well as the pasta dishes. Prices were very reasonable and I'll definitely be back to try out the other dishes."}
{"text":"We went here for one of our dinners in Vegas this weekend. We were able to get a good reservation on a short notice, and were seated near the window overlooking the Bellagio fountain so that was a nice touch.

Server was extremely knowlegable and even shared some additional knowledge he had about the Sommelier. Turns out he is one of four master sommelier's in Las Vegas, and has his own vineyard. Nice guy to chat with.

Now the food... We started with the Yellowtail, moved on to the Black Farfalle, and ended with the Aged Sirloin. Yellowtail was awesome, though could have been sliced a little thicker. If you have never had Black Farfalle, I suggest getting it here. The server mentioned it would have a shelfish taste, but I didn't find it to be overwhelming, instead a nice balance. The Aged Sirloin came with perfectly prepared Gnocchi, which is a hard task seemingly for many chefs to pull off. But they did tonight! The Barolo Ragu was a perfect addition to bring the dish altogether.

The only thing I would say is the wine list was a tad overpriced in comparison to what I would expect from retail / dining out. So that is what made the 4th star come out. 

Definitely a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Romantic and Intimate, Scarpetta is definitely a date night spot... Not for a company dinner for twelve.

Since there were twelve of us, we were seated in a private room with a spectacular view of the Bellagio's fountain attraction.  As the sun went down, the room got really dark to a point where everyone was falling asleep...

The best way to describe the food here was \"comforting\".  The chef here definitely turns complicated Italian dishes to something very down-to-earth. My favorite dish of the night was the appetizer Scallops with Mushrooms.  The combination between the two was harmonious from taste to its texture.  My second favorite dish was Pancetta-wrapped veal loin.  I love veal, but I ordered this mainly for the side of sweetbread, peas and carrots.  I am HUGE on sweetbread since I have fallen in love with it at Animal in West LA.  Every since then, I have tried sweetbread whenever I see them on the menu, but this one was by far the WORST sweetbread side ever :(  The cripy frito misto appetizer was too salty and mushy.  Probably need higher heat to fry them...

I would definitely come back here again and try other dishes.  I have been here before and tried the duck and foie gras ravioli and black cod and they were both amazing!  The Aged sirloin beef here is very dry."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Italian restaurants I've ever been to. Delicious from start to finish.

Yummy cocktails, pea soup with rock shrimp, and beet salad. Then Kobe rib cap, short rib agnolotti, ox tail gemelli, and spaghetti pomodoro. All were amazing. That simple house made spaghetti was really fantastic. My son inhaled it! Great service too.

We would definitely return."}
{"text":"I have to say the food was amazing and the chef came to our table and took the time to talk to us. I would rate the service and food a 10/10 and would bring client or friends anytime.."}
{"text":"Dined at Scarpetta for the 1st time.  Really enjoyable place.  It's dark and intimate so it's good for dates.  Had a view of the Bellagio Fountains bc we were seated at the window.  Very sophisticated decor.

Service (Luis) was very good. He seemed very passionate about food choices and pairings.   Very knowledgeable and personable.  

Their bread is served with  a nice trio of sauces.  We started with  beef carpaccio app.  Really good.  The combination they add on top really make it.  For entrees I had the octopus and shrimp risotto.  A bit of a kick to it so you won't have to add salt or pepper.  Great dish.   Wife had the cod.  Really creative presentation and she left her plate clean.

I do wish they had more wine selections by the glass.  Also, most of the meat dishes were really pricey.  

Nice night at Scarpetta..  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Food is yummy! Free assorted bread is yum. Venue is dark and sexy. Perfect view of bellagio fountains. Service could be better though"}
{"text":"Wasn't super impressed with this place at all. Food was just ok. Obi-ounce was insanely loud. I felt like I had to yell at my dinner companion. Not some where I'd come back. Great view thou!!!"}
{"text":"Had an interesting experience at scarpettas last night. After doing a lot of research on the Internet, we made reservations there for our 21st anniversary. When we arrived we were told their kitchen was closed due to a \"mishap\" but we could order from an alternate menu. We were a little confused but decided to go ahead since we were all dressed up and ready to eat. Once we were seated and looking at the menu, we realized that they were serving food from their sister restaurant next door. We were very disappointed since we've read so many good things about their food on yelp.     Then they brought out a complimentary appetizer which was very good. Had the meal and then they brought us 2 delicious desserts, one had \"happy anniversary\" written in chocolate on the plate. Very nice. Then the big surprise came when the waiter informed us that the meal was on the house!!!  Totally unexpected! maybe the waiter sensed our dissappointment earlier in the evening, but we hadn't complained at all. 

So... I can't give an honest review of their food. However, the fact that they gave us our meal free says A LOT about how they feel about their customers. Very classy.  They made things right in a big way. 

As for ambience... Very classy, dark, contemporary and cool. They sat us by the window with a nice view of the bellagio fountains. 

Again, can't tell u about scarpettas food, but how can I not give them 5 stars when they treated my wife and I so well."}
{"text":"Where to begin...  I went here 2 weeks ago and let's just say from the start it was sub-par.  First, the restaurant is practically hidden on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan.  Trendy, loud hipsters abound, bad sign.  There is a tiny sign that you have to walk down a half corridor to see if this is indeed Scarpetta.

The hostest, why are they all idiots, sat us in a half circle booth behind a party of 8.  So much for the view of the Strip.  Then it got worse, every waiter, bus-boy, customer as they passed behind us used the back the booth as a rail.  Pat, pat, pat 6 inches behind my head.  Awesome!  The interior of the place is the cause of this bad layout.  Giant columns everywhere, wrapped in god-awful brown padding.

I got the waiter and told him we needed to move.  He scurried away to get the manager?!?  She came over and did move us, hence the extra 1/2 star.  She moved us to the window, so I got to see the Strip with a large drape in the way, that hadnt been dusted in forever.  

On to the food, achoo!  Yes I sneezed my way through the dust cloud from pushing drape out of the way.  The salads were good, we split a garden salad and an heirloom tomato salad.  Then I ordered duck & foie gras ravioli & my dining companion ordered the halibut wrapped in pancetta.  Oh Scott Conant, yea of pretty hair and arrogance, you can't cook pastas right!  It was over cooked.  Here is a hint, if all the raviolis stick together its over cooked.  If they are gummy and mushy its over cooked.  The halibut was dry, really dry, I mean damn I need a lot of water to eat this dish dry.  For dessert we split the donuts stuffed with vanilla cream or nutella, they were pretty good.  

The waiter was ok, he got his wine varietals mixed up and he had a Richie-Rich hair do, not kidding, that was humorous.  The bread guy is priceless, an old italian guy with good bread who should have been running the place.  He probably forgot more about pastas than Scotty-boy knows.

All in all a forgettable experience, unless you like overpriced, mediocre food.  The rest of these 4 star reviews I got to wonder about, I mean their fav thing was the bread so 4 stars?"}
{"text":"Great dining experience. 
What I loved: duck, short rib appetizer, bread
What I liked: spaghetti, lobster salad, strip steak
What I meh'd: fois gras duck ravioli (super rich)"}
{"text":"This, like so many other places in Toronto, is on the cusp of a 5 Star delight, but is knocked down a touch for price. So listen up folks, if you can afford it, this is where you ought to be. You'll be cheering from the rooftops (here, a gorgeous and city-best rooftop patio) about your meal.

We went with a group of 7. My GF and I showed up early and grabbed a drink at the bar. A delicious pinto grigio will set you back $17 which seems steep, but they don't serve glasses of wine here; rather carafes. Maybe a glass and a half worth of wine, so at $17 it was actually a fine price for a delicious drink. When our group all arrived we were quickly whisked to a beautiful round table. Floor to ceiling windows let light in from one side while the glow of a bajillion-bottle wine collection illuminated from the other. The noise level was great, with big groups at big tables all suitably spread out so that conversations did not overlap. The decor was great and apart from the fact that the bar looked more like a hotel lobby with a liquor license than an actual bar (it is, to be fair, a hotel lobby after all) it felt like a very swish and yet very warm joint. 

A wonderful selection of bread and dips came as we ordered and, courtesy of the house, we received unbelievable Creamy Polenta with Fricasse of Truffled Mushrooms which made my mind melt and my soul sing. For apps I had a great meat dish with cheese and oil, which I am not doing justice. For dinner Laura (the ol' GF there) ordered fois gras and duck ravioli which she immediately declared the best she had ever had (food-wise, I'm sure...) while I had the steak. The steak was well presented as two think slices stood on their ends, so you sliced down the grains as opposed to against them as you would regularly. I forget what else was on my plate to be honest, the steak really was the focal point, but it was overall a great dish and the steak was cooked just right.

We enjoyed a great cheese plate afterwards and settled up the bill to have a nightcap on the roof. Sadly there was some Mario Andretti party going on that night (you win again Andretti) so we couldn't head up, but the staff was very kind and apologetic and even without the beautiful view it was still a great night.

It's not a place to eat much more than once or twice a year (unless you're really rolling in it) but those one or two visits will stay with you for quite some time. Great, exciting, luxurious place that's sure to make the belly big, even if it makes the wallet skinny."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came here for a bachelorette party and we had such a great dinner here.  The service was phenomenal and the decor was so classy and glam.  I thoroughly loved my duck foir grois ravioli and the desserts were so gorgeously presented and delicious to boot.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"While in Calgary on business last week, we met my customer for lunch at 500 Cucina...what a find!  I always drive through Inglewood and want to stop, but am usually in a taxi and on my way elsewhere.  Very modern place, lots of seating and a huge outdoor patio, and surprisingly pretty empty for lunch on a Tuesday.  I had the insalata misto salad, and took the waitress' suggestion to add prawns...probably some of the best shrimp I've ever had, perfectly cooked and super fresh, they were heaven on top of my light salad, that was dressed in a sweet balsamic vinaigrette.  And who doesn't love mozzarella cheese that tastes like it was made moments ago?  My customer had the caprese salad with prawns, and also enjoyed.  The only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is because the paninis came highly recommended, but the other two persons in my party just thought they were \"good\".  Regardless, I'm stopping in Inglewood every time I'm in Calgary from now on!  Oh, and my customer highly recommends all their pizza too!"}
{"text":"What a GEM! I am in L O V E. 

I'm gonna give you the play by play... but really all you need to know is to JUST GO.

Appetizer:
Heirloom tomato and burrata salad. Sounds typical, and honestly not terrifically unique, but it was done well. Perfectly ripe tomatoes with the creamiest burrata. Microgreens on top added just the right balance of herby bite.

Pastas:
SPAGHETTI. HOLY MOLY. Who knew that some plain spaghetti could have such nuanced and delicious flavors. I looked up the recipe online as soon as I got back to my hotel because you know this is making an appearance ASAP at home.

Pici with pesto and lobster. Very solid. I don't think this is an attempt-at-home pasta. It was excellent though.

Short rib agnolotti. Solid choice. Very flavorful.

For all the pastas, they were cooked PERFECTLY. Spaghetti really stole the show though.

Entree:
I had the fennel dusted cod. Honestly I was already getting pretty full by then... so I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I would have without the pasta binge. However, it was cooked perfectly and the first few bites were delectable. I actually couldn't finish because after our shared app and pastas, I was already getting full. The accompanying veg were also expertly cooked and paired well with the fatty fish.

Everyone else opted for the duck, veal, and filet. Meat eaters I guess.

Desserts:
PANNA COTTA. This was the second recipe I researched as soon as I got home. I am SO EXCITED to make this. Hawaii is my favorite place on earth and this is just hawaii in your mouth. Silky, smooth, and perfect.  Coconut, guava... so so tasty.

Chocolate souffle. I'm not the biggest souffle fan, but even I can appreciate the technical skill and mastery that went into the baking of our souffle. It came with a spiced choco sauce and cookie dough bites and fancy buncha crunch. It was delicious, just not my favorite.

I also had a perfectly crafted cappuccino. 

In short.... can't wait to try the bev hills location."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of vendors for dinner and we were not disappointed.  We started out with some of their signature cocktails which were good, I didn't have any of them, I'm a vodka soda kind of girl so I can't comment on the quality or taste of their drinks.  We also had an amazing bottle of italian red wine that complimented our meal perfectly.  The bread was fantastic...not only did we have different dips (marscapone butter, olive oil and eggplant tapaenade) but they also included meat and cheese stromboli!  Delicious!  

For dinner I coudln't decide so my friend and I shared the proscuitto wrapped veal loin and duck and foie gras ravioli.  The veal was good and the sauce was delicious.  The ravioli was the winner for me though, great combo of duck and fatty foie gras and the sauce of balsamic complimented it well.  For dessert I tried a bite of the blue cheese with dried fruit preserves and that was excellent as well.  

All in all and enjoyable meal and I would go back again."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised to dine at strip Italian restaurant that serves some REALLY GOOD Italian food. Even better when you get to see bellagio fountains as you devour awesome food.
We were started off with their signature bread basket with an assortment of 4 types of bread. The focaccia and ciabatta were my fav and my husband loved the broccoli mozzarella bread. Served with butter, olive oil and eggplant tapenade. 
They don't have a kids menu but have 2 pastas on the menu spaghetti in red sauce and another pasta in white sauce that kids can enjoy. Priced around $27-$30 pretty pricy for kids and portions are enough for a 9 year old. We ordered filet of beef which was by far one the best in town. My husband had the black cod which was delish and I had the raviolini served with Parmesan broth and truffle ricotta, so AWESOME and perfect temperature. Never had anything quite like this! So yummy!! 
It was a busy Sunday night and I only saw 2 servers and a lady who took care of water and dishes, stefania who was so sweet,  and a bread server. 
They do have a sommelier on site and he is very helpful with wine selections. Wine by the bottle is pricy, mostly all over $100 and very few in the $60s range. We decided to do wine by glass and they are all priced at $15 and up. I had a glass of prosecco $16, husband started with Pinot Noir $19 and then Chianti $15. 
Corkage fee is $35 as long as you don't bring a wine on their wine list. I would highly recommend bring your own bottle and pay the $35 coz their sparkling and white wine selection is pretty limited. 
For dessert we ordered tiramisu  $11, which was too good! Served with dark chocolate Scarpetta cookies, so yummy. Pic attached.
This is a pricy place, you are looking at $75 plus Per person but well worth the food and ambiance."}
{"text":"Very happy we came here. Nice seat facing Bellagio fountains. Started with the crispy fritto like - a fried julienned mix of zucchini and squid. For those opposed to squid or seafood this may be a nice introduction. Hubby ordered the veal chop. It was stellar- the grill flavor, tender all the way through and that can be iffy with veal. I had the spaghetti- what a simple dish, right? But the fresh ingredients with the perfect al dente of the pasta, highly recommended. Finished with , embarrassing forgot the name ! I would say nutella filled donuts. Given our seat I understand and appreciate the low light in that the Bellagio fountains are the star here. Yet it was a tad dark to my personal taste- or maybe I was just in a mood that night."}
{"text":"Super....great food....Super service...will def.be returning for a super meal...and they pour a great drink...don't miss it"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant, but slow service and bland taste keeps from being great. Group of 10, had 2-3 waiters sho had trouble remembering to come back and take care of us. We ordered a variety of steaks, pork chops, and duck, and the food was good and prepared to order, but the flavor was noticeably lacking. The most flavorful item we had was the side dish of homemade pasta. That is a sad statement considering that is a side dish on a fairly robust menu. I personally had the duck and while it was cooked properly it was just a very tough piece of meat. I truly wanted to like this place, but being raised Italian I would call it Italian only by name. The bread was like Cracker Barrel biscuits and the olive oil was thin and unflavorful.  I'm not sure we would go back, perhaps only in a pinch."}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to try this place after I watched Scott Conant make his famous spaghetti on Food Network. We made reservations and were seated next to a window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. The service was great and my husband's fettuccine with veal ragu was outstanding. I got the famous spaghetti with tomato-basil sauce and the noodles lived up to the hype - the most amazing pasta texture I've ever experienced. The sauce, however, was disappointing. Watching it being made I expected a fresh tasting tomato-basil sauce. What I received was an overly salted tomato sauce with no visible signs of basil that sadly reminded me of the sauce you get with spaghetti-o's (albeit not as sweet)."}
{"text":"Terrific dining experience on the strip! Service and food were excellent. They sat us at a table with a breathtaking view of the Bellagio's fountains next door and the northside of the strip - what a great way to get us to stay longer and spend more $$$ 

My wife and I ordered split plates (which they were happy to do - as elegantly as if you had ordered individual plates) which allowed us to try several dishes and still have room for desert. Their selection of freshly baked breads was delicious and included focaccia and other assorted Italian breads. Since this was our first time dining here, we played it pretty safe with our selections. We shared the roasted beat salad, burrata, duck & foie gras ravioli, and sirloin. For dessert: we shared an italian version of a beignet the name of which I can't remember. It was served a la mode and it was delish. 

All in all, I can't wait to return to try some of the more intriguing items on the menu."}
{"text":"One of the most amazing meals I've ever had. The bread basket alone was fantastic but we also ordered the spaghetti and pici. It's a good thing I live in Atlanta or I might frequent Scarpetta weekly."}
{"text":"Hate to do this but here goes:

Fave chef, perfection in Manhattan, many missteps in Vegas, who would have guessed. 

Severe drop off In service, and cook execution. Way overly salty, server promised to die for for pasta and steak specials total $140 that were complete salt and meat uncutable by knife.

Meal comped, let me say if you have been to the Manhattan restaurant don't bother here. 

Scott is The best but obviously cannot reign his tight control over his new ever growing empire. I thought he was better than this but everyone has their price....."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains and they hold back the seats nearest the windows for couples, making for a romantic setting.  The staff was professional and helpful, especially the manager.  Decent wine selection for individual glasses.  I had the Pici, a pasta with perfectly cooked lobster that was tasty.  Apps were good; I had the scallops and my wife had an asparagus soup that was light and creamy.
The highlight of the evening was the Ricotta and Truffle Agnolitta! The most perfect, light and tasty pasta ever made.  If you eat nothing else in Vegas... try that."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to Scarpetta for my birthday and it was a wonderful experience. If you're cheap don't bother with this place because you won't appreciate all of the ingredients and love put into the dishes.  We had a view of the Bellagio fountains and it was amazing! I had a pasta dish with fresh veggies and this sauce that was delicious. The pasta was homemade, so It had a smooth buttery taste to it. Overall great food and a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms is to DIE for!!! In fact, if it were (one of) the last thing(s) I ate, I could die happy. Exquisite flavor and display. Just love how every dish comes out with a dome cover and when ready to serve, the food is unveiled. Gets me giddy with joy every time!"}
{"text":"Leftovers for lunch yesterday, basically pasta all mashed together in a tupperware bowl, nuked into a hot mess. Didn't have a fork, but ended up using 2 plastic knives as chopsticks to eat at my desk in front of my computer while I worked. First bite I had,  first thought was, \"OMG!!! This is the worse pasta I have ever eaten in my life!  I can't believe I'm eating this!\"  Then I proceeded to eat half of it, constantly thinking, \"WHY AM I EATING THIS!!?!?!\" before I finally throw the rest of the contents away in disgust.  Why write about this experience?  Because throughout that experience, I kept thinking of the best pasta I had ever eaten which was the spaghetti at Scarpetta.  The texture, consistency, taste, and bite of the pasta was AMAZING!  The sauce was awesome, had a little bit of a kick to it.  I have to admit I have had better sauce, just barely, but that's because I really like a lot of garlic in my sauce, but the combination of the sauce and the spaghetti was incredible.  The rest of the meal was very good, the tomatoes & burrata dish, short ribs, polenta with truffles and assorted mushrooms, black cod with roasted tomatoes and fennel, coconut pannacotta, and crème brule were all excellent, but that pasta kicked this restaurant up another notch.  If you make reservations, ask for a window seat since we had an amazing view of the water show at the Venetian."}
{"text":"There was a lot of pomp and circumstance regarding Scott Conant's Scarpetta restaurant in Toronto before it opened. First there was the new Thompson Hotel and then of course there had to be a signature restaurant befitting such a hotel. So, I was very excited to try Scarpetta upon an invite for a girlfriend's birthday event. 

Intro. Never having been to the Thompson hotel before, I was expecting modern, edgy, chique boutique very much like the Delano or Tides of South Beach. 

Friday night. Where was the entrance to the hotel? Where were the valet people? I didn't notice so no problem. I was late anyways and in a rush. I found the entrance to the hotel and there was no one to open the doors for me...is this a first class hotel? The lobby is filled with side-cap boys and baggy jeans. This is Thompson Hotel right? There were two ladies behind desks which I assumed was the check-in area so I asked them where Scarpetta was. One responded \"to the left, walk a little bit and its at the end.\" I passed through what appeared to be the lounge/drinks area, and voila, I entered Scarpetta. 

Food. Isn't it funny that the one thing I remember the most was the tuna tar-tare with olive oil, salt, and greens. It was very yummy. The rest of the meal was entirely forgettable. To be fair, my girl friends and I did not try the pasta dishes which apparently is what Scarpetta is known for. I had the trout (yummy, but I can have trout anywhere) and my other two girl friends had meat. I asked them how it was and they responded good, but nothing spectacular. 

Ambiance. At first, the restaurant was quite quiet, but as it got later, the noise level increased. As we exited the restaurant, we entered the lounge/drinks area and it was packed. There were people standing and drinking and it almost looked like a club! I could not fathom how proper conversations could ensue in such noice, but meh, who cares about words...bring on the Veuve right? 

My girlfriends and I decided to explore the hotel a bit, and the lobby was full of younger looking girls dressed in clothes that showed too much. I felt like I was in high school again. 

Scarpetta is a restaurant where you would go to if you happened to be in the area. Food is good, but its nothing special. I would not go out of my way to eat at Scarpetta's. Next please."}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner on our last night in Vegas.  We would have given this place 5 stars but our main course and dessert weren't as good as our salad and pasta courses.

My husband and I were happy that we could share each course so that we could try a few things without feeling stuffed. I highly recommend the polenta and short rib angiolotti as appetizer and pasta courses. The polenta was smooth and creamy and the angiolotti was heavenly! The trio of lamb was so-so and might have been better if just the lamb chop was served. 

Our server was very attentive and we would definitely recommend coming for good food, service and a beautiful view of the bellagio fountains!"}
{"text":"First Impressions: Classy, classy, classy! Scarpetta is located on the 3rd floor in the Cosmo and everything about this restaurant screams class. 

My reservation for Scarpetta was for 1/1/2014 at 7:30 pm. The actual reservation was made about a week prior and I had put in a request to be seated with a view of the Bellagio fountain show. Upon arrival, the hostess said they had tried their best to accommodate my request but that we would be seated one row away from the window view of the fountains. Nevertheless, I appreciate the honesty and their earnest efforts. 

The service was impeccable and up to the standards of a Scott Conant restaurant. My bf and I were seated and presented with the menus immediately. Our waters were filled and a wine menu was brought to the table. My bf decided to order the duck and foie gras ravioli with marsala reduction ($27) and I ordered the endive and apple salad with heirloom beets, gorgonzola cheese and candied walnuts ($17). 

Once our orders were placed, the breadbasket was brought out. I truly appreciated the attention placed into informing the patrons on the different types of breads and dips. It was helpful because now I knew exactly what types of gourmet breads we would be feasting on! From what I can recall, I remember a small ciabatta, a piece of foccacia, and two breads with mozzarella and salami baked in. The breads were warm, and enclosed in a cloth napkin with another piece of traditional Italian bread placed atop it. The bread basket was divine and each piece of bread paired nicely with the soft, spreadable butter, salty eggplant spread and the citrus-infused olive oil dip. As a matter of fact, the bread was so good that I asked the server for another basket and that was brought out--only to be devoured again! 

As for the entrees, the presentation was extremely beautiful for both dishes. The foie gras was plated on the plate with the marsala reduction drizzled beautifully over the top. The ravioli was plentiful and this surprised my bf since he was only expecting a handful of ravioli. My endive and beet salad was truly one of the most beautiful salads I've ever seen. The endives were sliced thinly and the bitter after taste of the endives paired quite nicely with the sweetness of the beets, apples and candied walnuts while the salty gorgonzola cheese bits added the necessary salty punch to the sweet and bitter. 

The ambience was romantic, dim and quiet. My bf and I really enjoyed dinner that night. The overall price may not be cheap but for the quality of the food, it was well justified.
 
Bottom line: I would return for that breadbasket alone!"}
{"text":"We got last minute reservations and were surprised to get a table for 2 at 7:30.  We were even more surprised being seated at a table that overlooked the Bellagio fountains.  Terrific view.

The bread basket was great, but the stromboli bread full of meat and cheese was amazing.  Worth it just for that.  Wife started with the creamy polenta - 5 hour cooked polenta with mushroom and truffle sauce, each served in their own pot, whilst the sauce is meant to be spooned over the polenta.  Very good, not as truffly as we both expected.  I got a very pretty beet salad with homemade mozzarella.

Agnolotti and spaghetti for our Primi courses.  As good as the other reviews say.  Extremely rich.  Black Cod for Secondi that was not quite as memorable as the pasta or bread.  Could have skipped this.

Highly recommend.  Best service, best ambiance of our stay."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for the weekend to celebrate my birthday. Came here with a group of friends who lives in Vegas. We got the private room that overlooks the Bellagio water fountain. I was impress with the view, decor and service. I got the foie gras ravioli and it was amazing! Ravioli was perfectly cooked, foie gras filling was not too overwhelming, sauce was well balanced and complimented the dish very well.  Sommelier Kyle was very helpful in helping us decide on a nice bottle of wine to go with our dish. Staff was very patient and attentive with us especially because a few friends were running late.  I didn't feel rushed to put in an order. It was a nice relaxing evening catching up with some old friends."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant because I was looking for a place where 5 large business men (my bro-in-law is here for a conference), my sister and I could all eat and be happy. I was a little worried because I'm vegan and they are very big meat eaters and they are super fancy with a lot of money. 

This restaurant could not have been NICER! we ended up doing the tasting menu for the table and they did a whole separate tasting for me (without making a big deal out of it which I REALLY appreciated). My food was so incredible and I didn't feel like an outcast. I can't tell you how grateful I am and was. 

This place has an incredible view of the Bellagio fountain and all the food is outstanding. The service was wonderful, super accommodating and had a really mellow, positive and professional energy. I loved it and I will 100% come back and recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We have been here before and typically enjoyed our dinner, however this time was certainly different. Garvin tried to be attentive, however it was clear that if we weren't going to spend a certain amount we were not ok from his perspective regardless of who ordered what. We also had to ask for more bread twice. Despite my husband and I ordering a fair amount and asking for our friend's name to be spelled correctly on her dessert for her birthday party (showing Garvin how it was spelled) it was incorrect and disappointing. On top of that, the waiter hit me in the head with the plate as he served the table behind us. Really?? Conant we had more stringent expectations of your staff....."}
{"text":"Our 10th Anniversary/Valentine's Day celebration dinner was perfect, thanks to our wonderful meal at Scarpetta Tuesday night.  I made a reservation at Scarpetta for Valentine's Day based on great reviews, a great Chef running the place, and the fact it wasn't overly pricey.  I am so glad I choose this gem!  The restaurant decor is so lovely and romantic.  We were sat next to the window overlooking the Belagio fountains... how perfect!  My Husband's view was somewhat blocked, but we really enjoyed the atmosphere.

The food is great.  We absolutely LOVED the bread basket with dipping sauces.  Each was great in their own way, but the butter and eggplant was awesome.  The stromboli (included in the bread basket) was literally to die for.  We shared the short rib appetizer, which was small, but tasty.  This was our least favorite thing we ate, but it was still really good.  For our entree we shared the duck and foie gras ravioli.... it took my breath away!  It was so rich and delicious- I will be thinking about this one for awhile.  For dessert we had the zeppolis, which were a great way to end a fabulous meal.

We loved this restaurant and love the vibe in the cosmopolitan.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a review for their social hour, which is 5;30-7 M-Thurs. It is a perfect place for a drink and good quality quick bites before a show--everything on the menu, including cocktails, is $7, which was a spectacular deal, especially for the location. We ordered the truffled polenta, which was rich and full of umami flavor. 
-fritto misto was tasty, has shrimp and squid in it as well as veggies and lemon
-arancini were crisp and flavorful
-short rib agnolotti had good amounts of beef in there so you could really taste it, but they were a bit oily

A big treat was complimentary house-made potato chips that were still warm. You get a big bowl of them! 

It's a nice way to be able to sample several dishes from the regular dinner menu, and service was excellent."}
{"text":"We arrived at our reservation on time and were seated promptly. The restaurant has nice views of the Bellagio fountains. 

The meal started with their freshly baked bread and spreads which were divine. We started with the beef tartare and the polenta. Tartare, very fresh. The polenta, honestly, some of the best I've had. So cheesy!! I would come back for this dish alone! For my entree, I got the pasta with lobster. The dish, when brought out I thought was on the small side, but once I took a bite, I understood why. Extremely rich. A little too rich for my tastebuds. I actually couldn't finish it, which doesn't happen often. Delicious, but just too rich. Dessert, we ordered the bombolini that were filled with either vanilla or chocolate filling. Highly recommend these. Also ordered the chocolate cake, good, but I'm not the biggest chocolate cake fan. My brother-in-law who loves chocolate loved the cake. 

Good service and food with gorgeous views."}
{"text":"A lot of ups and downs for us on our stop here!

As per yelp, we requested a view of the Bellagio fountains.  Absolutely gorgeous!  However, there is a horizontal opaque support bar right at eye level if you're 6'0, so you have to duck or stand up a little bit to actually look out the window.

Service was great as you would expect at any nice Vegas restaurant.

Appetizers were delicious!  We had the scallops and the polenta per our waiter's recommendations.  Among the best you can ever find among appetizers.

Our entrees were a different story.  I don't feel the spaghetti was that special.  A former reviewer referenced \"Asian hand-pulled noodles\" and was dead on.  Any quality housemade noodle will taste like this, and it is very basically seasoned.  Not quite a great entree in itself, especially a meatless dish for a carnivore like myself.

The lady got foie gras ravioli, as she is a foie gras FIEND.  However, even this dish came out a little salty with only a hint of foie gras detected.  The pasta was still good.

Maybe our expectations were too high after the appetizers.

We also didn't get any wine, though I heard the wine list is fabulous.

The price is very reasonable too.  We'd probably come back.  Well, there are a lot of places to try in Vegas, so maybe not."}
{"text":"Really didn't expect to order a steak here.  Yet had one of the best bone in ribeyes I've ever had anywhere (was a special).  Was 24 oz of amazingness.  Ate at SW steakhouse the night before ... And this blew it away (also had their bone in).  

Went with my girlfriend and also wanted to sit by the window for a great view.  They accommodated.  Service was solid and they tossed in a free dessert (not sure why...said \"congrats\" on it....but we never told them we were celebrating anything).  

All in all, a great experience and meal."}
{"text":"We had the most amazing time here! While in Vegas, for my bachelorette party, we called the day of for reservations and they were able to accommodate. They even sat us in a private room in the back of the restaurant with views of the Bellagio fountains. Our waiter was fantastic! He recommended the best wine and had great suggestions for food. Everything came out timely and he made sure our glasses were full. After dinner, they brought out a desert plate that had \"congratulations\" written on it. Above and beyond! Going to Mora Italian in Phoenix next week, also owned by Scott Conant, and I cannot wait! Thanks for such an unforgettable dinner!"}
{"text":"A fantastic dining experience. The staff was attentive an knowledgeable. The view was wonderful and included the Vegas skyline, plenty of greenery and the periodic excitement of the Bellagio fountain show. The food was memorable from the bread basket to dessert and everything in between. The spaghetti is as good as you've heard and the creme brulee napoleon was stunning.  More accessible and less intimidating menu than some of the other top tier restaurants in Las Vegas, but the food and service is every bit as good. Can't miss with Scarpetta, I will go back for seconds."}
{"text":"Scarpetta has amazing food and is in a great location with nice views. 

The yellowtail and polenta appetizers were both delicious with the yellowtail being slightly better.

The short rib agnolloti and the duck and foie gras ravioli were two amazing pastas that are very unique to the restaurant.

The entrees did not live up to the first two courses but the baby goat was satisfying. I wouldn't recommend the halibut.

The head chef Scott Conant was in the restaurant which is very rare for Vegas. When you head to this restaurant stick mostly with the pastas and appetizers and you will have a unique and enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"Squid ink pasta with seafood and tobiko was so decadent and good for the soul . Branzino was also cooked perfectly. Chocolate soufflé was good but not great"}
{"text":"We had a wedding reception at the end of May 2018. Therefore, my review is based on private dining. We had the Vino Room booked. There is a maximum seating capacity of 30 I believe and a minimum spend that must be met in food and beverage. There was 24 of us and two long tables were set up. We weren't crowded and had the right amount of room for us. Our menu was one we chose ahead of time and served family style except for our main which we chose there but served individually. We had a dedicated server by the name of Luis and he was amazing. Very attentive and always making sure dishes were cleared, water was filled, and drinks were topped up. Our starters were scallops, burrata salad and a wild mushroom truffled polenta. The scallops were cooked to perfection and fresh tasting, burrata salad was refreshing and the polenta was creamy and light tasting.  The pasta selection we had was tomatoe basil spaghetti, foie grois ravioli, and short rib angliotti. The tomatoe spaghetti was one of our favourite, the foie grois ravioli and the angliotti were also very good. I chose as a main black cod. It was so moist, flaky and cooked perfectly. I tried the tenderloin beef. So flavourful and tender. I wish I could've had more. The deserts were all good."}
{"text":"Service: Top notch
Food: Great
Ambiance: Great

Sat myself at the bar area. Very small awkward area with the little tables next to the bar, would be pissed if someone sat me there. A very nice dude named Nikolai welcomed me with a smile and gave me a menu. Immediately decided between the Spiced Duck Breast and the Short Rib Agnolotti. Nikolai the bartender/server suggested the..

SHORT RIB AGNOLOTTI
brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb $25

If the restaurant wasn't a fancy one, I would have licked my plate. My only complaint is there was not a large helping and I would have liked a little more food (when dont I want more food?).

Drank two San Remo's (fruity.. yum!) and a Billionaire (too citrus-y.. eh and I really like citrus-y things).

Service was good, my drink was always full and the bread was good. I'd recommend reservations highly, the dining room area seats about 100 people. Some of the tables even have a view of the Bellagio water fountains.. cooooool. Will definately have to be back for a full dinner one night (and not when I'm just trying to get something in my stomach before I drink alot of booze at the Blvd Pool).

After 3 drinks and my entree bill was $73 before tip."}
{"text":"My favorite thing at Scarpetta is the meat bread and it's not even something you order! I came here with a big group of girls as part of a bachelorette weekend. The ambiance is very classy and the service is impeccable. I ordered the pici pasta -- amazing! Since then, I've heard that the dish they're known for is the spaghetti, so I'll have to try it sometime when I get the chance.

{"text":"Amazing experience!! Started with a couple cocktails at the very hip/swanky bar. Was led to our table by a stunning hostess. We overlooked the Bellagio fountains, by far one of the best veiws in Vegas. 

We took our seats and were greeted by a very friendly server who offered great suggestions and answered all of our food questions. 

 We looked thru the wine list and decided to ask for a somm to guide us. A smartly dressed younger gentleman came to our table and convinced us to try something new and interesting. It was a little more then I usually spend but decided to trust him. I have to say he really nailed it! Amazing wine, we wound up buying another bottle half way thru our meal!

Speaking of the meal....spectacular!! Perfectly cooked pasta, my duck was incredible. The service through out was impressive to say the least. The best I've had in Vegas in quite a long time. We will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"I love Scarpetta :)

The spaghetti there is delicious. I ran into Scott Conant at the South Beach Food & Wine Festival and he insisted I try out his restaurant. I'm glad I did. When I lived in Miami I frequented the Scarpetta in the Fontainebleau. The bars in the Miami Scarpetta v the Vegas Scarpetta are very similar. I like the layout of the Vegas Scarpetta better but the views of the two restaurants are the same. Miami overlooks the Fontainebleau pool area and water and Vegas overlooks the Bellagio fountains. The most recent visit to the Vegas Scarpetta was my favorite. One of the specials that night was a black truffle pasta. AMAZING. It was so delicious and filling, total comfort food. Granted it was a $60 (small, probably nutrionally not good for my figure) bowl of pasta but worth every penny (and bite).

Of course service was spot on and the house Riesling was great."}
{"text":"I was planning on giving it 2 stars but decided to give it 3 since the manager was so apologetic and assured me that my concerns would be taken care of. 

SERVICE: 1 star
FOOD: 4 Stars
Drinks: 3 Stars
Dessert: 1 Star
Atmosphere: 4 Stars

OVERALL: 2.6 

SERVICE: 
Our server Micheal was very condescending...I don't speak Italian so don't get upset when your table asks you what an Italian word on the menu means. He forgot our second bread basket... I had to ask 3 times for it (they have amazing bread lol) and when we asked if they do anything for birthdays he gave us a look that was like \"really?\". Terrible service and if I'm going to pay $50-$60 for a meal, I should receive great service. At the end of our meal we ordered coffee. I worked at a coffee shop for 5 years and was hoping they knew how to make my drink. They didn't which was fine but the server was so disgusted by my order which I thought was kinda funny. It's a Cortado which is equal parts espresso & equal parts steamed milk. Not that complicated. It's similar to a macchiato but it's not a macchiato. So he brought out a macchiato... cool

FOOD: 
- Bread 5 STARS: So good we asked for TWO baskets! Their bread baskets had a variety of bread with Sourdough, Ciabatta, some kind of bread with salami (I think it was salami) and cheese, and one other kind that I didn't get to try. 

- Colorado Lamb 3.5 STARS : I had the lamb...this one was a little disappointing. I've had way better lamb from another high end restaurant and paid half as much. I ordered it medium well and they gave it to me with a lot of pink left. It was also VERY FATTY... not a fan of fatty meats. There was also a piece of foil left on my meat from how they cooked it. 

- Filet of Beef: 5 STARS- my friend ordered this bad boy. It was cooked to perfection!!! I wish I ordered that! I honestly can't say much about it since it wasn't my meal. I had a little taste though. My friend loved it and said it was some of the best steak he's ever had. 

- Raviolini 4 STARS - the vegetarian of the group ordered this. She loved it so much that she finished it before I could ask for a bite! She said 4 Stars because it was such a small quantity and she's had better before. Feel free to disregard this part since I didn't try it. 

DESSERT... 
This was a joke it was so disrespectful that I wish they never brought it out. I didn't even eat it I just left it. They said \"oh yeah let me bring the bday boy a special treat.\" They might as well have slapped me in the face lol look at the pics and you'll see what I'm talking about. 

DRINKS: 
Way too strong and way too expensive. We ordered a gin and tonic along with a vodka cranberry. Both of them must have been at least 50% alcohol lol. I like to enjoy my drinks... we kinda had to just power through them lol. We also ordered some coffee which was whatever honestly. Their average bottle of wine cost anywhere from 120-200 a glass of their cheap Chianti cost 15. I expected expensive but not THAT expensive. Corking fee is $50 so bring your own bottle. 

Atmosphere:
Super cute and super romantic. We even had a view of the Bellagio fountains! The only drawback was how dark the lighting was. Waaaay to dark. We sat by the wall of wine which was really aesthetically pleasing but also annoying because we had employees grabbing bottles from the wall. In order to get a bottle they had to squeeze in between us and the wall. That happened about 5-6 times while we were there."}
{"text":"The fois gras ravioli are as good as they sound. The ambience is a bit strange, but the food more than makes up for it and the service is very attentive."}
{"text":"5 star restaurant!! Just left this place and cant stop talking about how good it was. Starting with the service which was beyond excellent to the gourmet food and the delicious desserts. Enjoyed every minute of it!! If you are staying at the cosmo or happen to be in the area make sure you visit this amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"So let's begin....Jason was our server at table 65 on May 21, 2017 for a 945 reservation. I had to ask him if there were any specials(which there was 1) and never stopped once to asked us how our food was. I ordered a cappuccino that never came. How can I remind him if he never came by?!!!!  It's not about the food, it's about customer service. We had appetizers and food in less than an hour."}
{"text":"Phenomenal restaurant. I've had the pleasure to dine at some pretty great places around the country and this was in the top 5. 

Let's start with the food. Delicious. Basically perfect. One down side - they were not offering the tasting menu the evening I was there. As a fan of tasting menus (especially with wine pairings!) this was disappointing. Anyway, as others have mentioned, the bread is great. We also started with the short rib risotto appetizer as well as the fritto misto. Both were delightful. As far as the entrees - myself and my 3 dining partners all got pasta. The spaghetti (again, as many other reviewers have commented on) was wonderful. I don't think I've EVER ordered spaghetti at a restaurant and probably wouldn't had I not read the rave reviews on yelp (though the waiter did highly recommend it). It was simple yet extremely tasty. The only gripe I have is it seemed a little overpriced given the minimalistic dish (~$24) but was fair given the prices of other dishes on the menu. We also tried the duck and foie gras ravioli which was rich and delicious. The beef short rib pasta was also very good, though a little too horseradishy for my taste. 

The food would've earned the restaurant 5 stars in my book regardless, but the service made the experience one of a kind. Maybe the waiter has the same \"routine\" for everyone, but who cares? He was attentive, friendly, professional but not at all annoying. 

The only bad part about the night is I didn't get to try dessert (too full)!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just went to Scarpetta the other night.  The food, overall, was delicious.  The service was ok.  The bread didn't come out until the appetizers which is a huge pet peeve, but whatever.  The big problem was the portion size.  My tiny little turbot cost $38.  My husband's chicken was half a breast at best.  $250 later, we ended up going to Secret Pizza at the Cosmo for a slice after our dinner at Scarpetta.  Secret Pizza, on the other hand, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I mangia'd molto bene at Scarpetta during my most recent trip to the Strip.  The ambiance at this sophistocated Cosmopolitan restaurant is very sexy, and we were fortunate enough to be seated by the huge picture window with views of the Bellagio fountains spraying in the background.  To enjoy your meal at Scarpetta as I did, follow these instructions and thank me later:

1) Start of with a glass of Gosset.  There aren't many wines by the glass to choose from on the menu, but a glass of Gosset (even if it'll set you back $20 for a singular champagne flute of this nectar from the gods) is worth it.

2) Sample the fritto misto and Wagyu beef tartare to start.  Sure, these are old Italiano standbys, but they do it up here, adding cured egg, parmigiano, toasted hazelnuts, and sea salt to the tartare.  SO GOOD.

3) Devour the black farfalle (with Maine lobster) and the spiced duck breast (with endive, preserved orange, and delicious cippollini onion).  I split these dishes with my friend and it was the perfect portion size, not to mention SCRUMPTIOUS.  Jersey was a good choice to wear during this meal.

4) Polish it all off with the Zeppole for dessert, if you're a fan of Nutella.

Grazie mille, Scarpetta, for a wonderful experience!  I will definitely be back to try your famous spaghetti."}
{"text":"So I won this 5-team parlay and decided to treat my parents to a nice dinner and we were all in the mood for pasta.

This was my first time being introduced to a Scott Conant restaurant and was certainly not disappointed. I can't even tell you how many dishes we ordered but we had to go big! Black tagliolini, prime filet, veal chop, duck and foie Gras ravioli, mushrooms, broccolini, polenta and of course the spaghetti. 

To be completely honest with you the dishes were all solid. Nothing wrong with any of them. HOWEVER, the humble spaghetti, boring as it may look and sound, stole the show entirely. It was so good it made me regret ordering the tagliolini and all the apps when I could've gotten two of the spaghettis! 

If you come on a date night I highly recommend each of you ordering another main and then ordering the spaghetti to share so you can get a good variety of dishes while also being able to enjoy Scarpetta's best dish."}
{"text":"It is a clean trendy restaurant with good food, but it is a little pricey and I expected a little more after reading all of the reviews.  I would recommend going in with lower expectations and you will be happy.

Food
The food was very good, but it was not the best pasta I have eaten.  That honor goes to Babbo in New York.  I would give Scarpetta an 8/10.  It was rather pricey so not a good bang for the buck restaurant.  Dinner for 2 was $150 with 1 glass of wine each.  So it was good, but not great.
Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli.  This was the best dish of the night.  There were about 10 small raviolis and they were cooked just right.  They were tender and full of flavor.  9/10
Tomato & Basil Spaghetti.  It is a simple dish and the pasta is cooked al dente.  I would have preferred a little more tomato or basil flavors with the spaghetti, but it was good.  It looked small at first, but there was a good amount of pasta with the dish.  8/10.
Colorado Lamb Loin.  The lamb was cooked medium rare and it was tender.  It was less gamey than other lambs and I think I wanted more flavor from the lamb itself.  6/10.  I expected more for $40.
I had both the Rosso and the Rubrato red wines.  Both were excellent and they had a very through wine list.  9/10  

Ambiance
It is quite a scene in the Comsopolitan.  There were a lot of women hitting the club on the level above the restaurant.  The restaurant itself had a view overlooking the strip.  Unfortunately, not all of the tables have that view and our table did not.  I would recommend making sure you get a table with a view.  You should for the price.  The restaurant looked clean and modern, similar to the hotel itself.  The chairs and tables were a little strange.  The chairs were hard to move and the table seemed to slide when you pushed away from it in your chair.  10/10

Service
The waiter was attentive and kept checking on us throughout dinner.  He knew the menu and was informed about the dishes.  9/10"}
{"text":"Bread basket with Stromboli, focaccia and other more basic roll.  The bread basket came with butter, eggplant areas and citrus olive oil.  The citrus olive oil was amazing paired with the Stromboli!

Berry smash - this drink was very good

Yellowtail sashimi - 4 stars. rock salt used was unique and yellowtail was tender.  

Signature Spaghetti dish -  5 stars. This dish was really incredible.  Delicious in it's simplicity.   The noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce light yet flavorful.  I have not had anything like it before and I will be trying to recreate it at home.

Short rib agnolotti -  5 stars. This was excellent!  It has a very strong horse radish taste so you have got to really like horse radish!  

Pici - 4 stars. This dish was very good.  The noodles are cooked al dente. A little too mu/ch so for my taste.  There was tons of lobster.  I enjoyed the lobster paired with the tarragon.  I do not normally like pesto but I really liked the chili pesto in this dish.  

The restaurant is very nice however we were a party of 5 and were seated right by the exit sign and bus area.  It seems this restaurant is more suited for parties of 4 our less. as there is not a lot of seating for a larger party."}
{"text":"So, I was in Vegas for a fab Race/Scavenger Hunt event, and met up with friends the night before the event at Scarpetta for what I hoped would be an excellent meal.  It did not disappoint.

There were some nice-sounding appetizers on the menu, but we bypassed those in favor of ordering the day's pasta special as our starter.  it was linguini with truffle, and it was perfect.  Possibly the best pasta I've ever eaten.  Seriously, I wish I'd ordered that again as my meal.  And then maybe again as dessert.

Table faves included the aged sirloin, the orata rossa, the scallops and the sunchokes.  The roasted baby carrots were also pretty great.  The spaghetti was fine, but, honestly, after that starter, it just couldn't compete.  The gingerbread-pear crisp was the fave dessert, though all were good.

The fave wine of the night was the super tuscan, though it was crazy with sediment (something I'm surprised they didn't notice before serving it)."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible. We tried the tasting menu with wine pairing and the first dish to arrive is sushi. If it had been good, no problem. However the yellowtail smelled and tasted funky and the tuna was ruined with truffle oil. The flavorless dishes kept rolling and the service was equally terrible. 

We walked away feeling completely ripped off by a restaurant with an identity crisis. When i spend upwards of 300 on a meal, i expect good attentive service and good food. If a full plate goes back, i expect someone to notice and speak to us but no one cared at all. 

For a guy like scott who is so critical on these cooking shows, you really should revisit your own house. There are just too many places in vegas for places like this to survive."}
{"text":"Returned to Scarpetta last night!
It is consistently one of the \"Best\" dinning experiences in the entire city of Las Vegas.
Mike the Wine Steward made it even more special, thank you.
Just trust me when I say this, from the time you enter the restaurant to the time you leave, everything from service, wine, food is exceptional.
The Staff is really really well trained and very very nice.
Make you feel like family."}
{"text":"The food and customer service at this place was beyond incredible, you can taste how the food is freshly made and every bite you take into your meal takes you a step further into paradise. I've been to many restaurants down the strip in Vegas and I could tell you this one really stood out to me & every time I'm back here I make sure to make a reservation in advance since this place is always booked (which trust me is a good sign)"}
{"text":"A-OK is what Scarpetta was. I was very excited to finally taste the famous pasta from the man himself-Scott Conant. I have been watching Chopped for weeks and was curious what exactly does he think amazing pasta is. Well Scott maybe Pasta is the only thing you should stick to.

We have ordered the Hamachi, Tuna, Polenta, Foie Gras Ravioli, Black Cod and the Tasting Menu.

Let's start from the beginning. First of all I would like to say that the service was beyond reparable. We sat at the restaurant for almost 3 hours. It took the server to give us the menu for about half an hour and every time we looked for him he wasn't there. After hinting and hinting that we would like our food right away the longer it took to the point where we just left.

Here is the breakdown:

Hamachi: nothing special-Nobu beats this dish any day of the week.

Tuna Susci: If you think wrapping tuna over a bunch of carrots is creative-think again.

Polenta: I really enjoyed this dish. It came in a small pot with a mushroom sauce on the side. This was one of my favorite appetizers.

Black Cod: it was A-OK. I wish it had more flavor and was more moist. I guess beggars can't be choosers. 

Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli: The dough was chewy and hard. The sauce on top ruined the whole dish in my opinion. The inside was tender and rich. I think if the ravioli were smaller and more tender it would come together better.

Tasting Menu:

Fritto Misto: A-OK. I like anchovies but I don't think this dish brought anything special to the table.

Spaghetti with tomato and basil was the best dish of the night! It was tender, flavorful and tasty. I would have this again any day!

Dessert: the chocolate cake was dry and even with the gelato on the side it still left a bitter rough flavor in my mouth!

We tried a few other things which I don't even care to discuss on the Tasting Menu

The bread basket was also pretty amazing! It came with 3 sauces which we ordered a second round of!

Overall I am not impressed by this Italian Restaurant. This has nothing to do with price or the atmosphere. I think as a food critic what you look at is the freshness of the food and the service. I have seen a lot of bad service but ignoring your patrons will not bring you very far.

So Scott Conant I am giving you a C+. You have been chopped!"}
{"text":"My GF and I ate there on Easter for dinner.  When we arrived at like 5:15pm the place was virtually empty and there was more waitstaff and other workers than diners.  We were promptly seated by the hostess but st ther for like 10 minutes plus without anyone waiting on us.  Finally I got so frustrated I got up to leave and I told the waiter that was servicing the table next to me that I had had it and was leaving and he promptly apologized and said there must be a mix-up but that he would take care of me which he did....I think he threw in a free beer.  Anyway, the food was good...salad and pizza and the decor is nice.  

I almost ever complain about service as I am very low maintenance but this lack of being initially waited on was very off-putting."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and service. 

Competitive pricing and food very tasty!"}
{"text":"My Wife and I had dinner here during our trip to Vegas. This is one of the restaurants located inside The Cosmopolitan Hotel. 

Bottom line up front, it was an \"okay\" restaurant. Not worthy of your time but if you insist, don't say I didn't forewarn yah.

Menu. Small and limited a with a few options in each of the sections you'd expect.

Drinks. Expensive as expected . Moscow was pretty strong, however it was tart and not sweet enough.. could have used a shot of simple syrup. 

Food. I ordered their Filet Minion, medium rare of course. The inside was cooked fine, however the outside was way to seared... it was basically charred. The meat, was pretty dry and the sauce they provide on the plate was for decoration and not enough to last your $48 piece of meat.  The Wife ordered some ravioli in some lemon sauce which was okay, but I like my sauce thicker and richer. 

Ambiance. A scooch to dark, but it was the bar area since the restaurant was booked.

In conclusion, I recommend passing. To expensive for the mediocre food and drinks you get in return."}
{"text":"This review is actually 4.5 stars!!!  I visited their NY location last year and luckily was able to visit this one during our stay in Vegas this passed weekend.  Nothing was amiss in terms of service and cordiality.  Was very tempted to try the famous $24 spaghetti again but decided to expand my horizons and try something new.  (Yet we still had the creamy polenta.. orgasmic). Boyfriend had the Sheep cheese ricotta ravioli with truffle shavings and I had the Prime Filet of Beef - Med. Rare w/ potato puree... fricken delicious! I was naseous for most the day.. even at the beginning of our meal but I scarfed down the steak and finished off most of my plate.  Didn't care so much for the rainbow chard as I found it a bit salty.  Boyfriend agreed.  We completed our meal by sharing the Coconut Panna Cotta w/ Guava Soup - so good and regreshing!  Would come back just for that on a hot day if I could.

Our server was this tall guy w/ a beautiful Trinidad accent who had a very kind demeanor about him.  Forgot his name but make sure you get seated in his area. ^_^"}
{"text":"Don't let anyone talk up pasta like it's going to change your life, it's just pasta...
With that being said, the pasta at Scarpetta is pretty damn delicious. If you're going to pay $25 to $35 for a pasta dish, Scarpetta is the best place to do it.

We visited Scarpetta at 8 PM on a Thursday and sat at the bar until our table was ready. The bartender, Nicole, was a delight. She opened a bottle of Sauv Blanc for me since they did not serve any by the glass, and that's what I was looking for. I can always appreciate someone who goes above and beyond to make sure that the paying customer gets what they're looking for. The \"crack chips\" at the bar are highly addictive, don't even start...

We were seated shortly after taking a few sips of our drinks at the bar, near the window where we could see the Bellagio water fountain show. I was expecting the view to be more romantic and clear - there are beams and walls that are kind of in the way. Regardless, it's a very nice view (I just feel that they advertise it a bit differently than it actually is). The service was great and so pleasant. We ordered a braised short rib appetizer that was delicious, along with the spaghetti dish, pichi dish and the side of mushrooms. Everything was damn near perfect. I prefer my pasta a bit more cooked, but I can appreciate that the Scarpetta way is how it should be done, with hand made pasta, in house. The sauces are so amazing, the flavors are just perfect...

We didn't have any room for dessert but next time, I swear I will get into those bombolini nutella things, they were on every table and looked so good.

The ambiance is quiet and calm and it felt so good to get away from the chaos that is Vegas. I've eaten at many vegas restaurants and I feel that Scarpetta is perfect for a date and low key evening to enjoy one another's company and some GREAT italian food!"}
{"text":"Based on the excellent reviews we decided to try 500 Cucina last night. We took a cab both directions so we could enjoy a nice evening with good food and wine. The food was nothing special and the waiter seemed to not enjoy serving us. I would consider all four of us easy going and not demanding at all. He seemed annoyed if he had to give us another minute to decide on drinks, food , dessert, so then he would not come back for 10 minutes. The place is small and not bus,y so  not sure why? At the end of the night we wanted to order shots to celebrate one of our birthdays. The waiter actually questioned our friend on whether he indeed wanted to participate and then started to quote ALCB laws. It was very strange and awkward. Like really... I think he is capable of handling himself and you just put a downer mood on the whole thing. It did give us something to talk about  on the cab ride home, we talked about how we will not return."}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG!

If you're in Vegas you have to, MUST GO! eat at Scarpetta Words can't describe the yumminess of it all. 

All their pastas were perfectly al dente. Foie raviolis were my favorite."}
{"text":"Yum, Yum, Yum! I really enjoyed this restaurant. The decor was very sleek and we were seated next to a window with a gorgeous view of the Bellagio fountains. We started off with the orgasmic Raw Yellowtail as an appetizer. As an entree i had Stracci which was pasta with lobster, crab, shrimp and basil breadcrumbs. It was very light yet flavorful. The ambiance was quiet and intimate, perfect for a romantic dinner and conversation. The service was not memorable not extremely attentive. It was just okay, but the view, ambiance, and food outweigh the lack of service."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful! The somm was a great guy, very personable and connected with all the tables. I highly recommend checking this place out. Amazing cauliflower rabbit soup. Awesome pasta. Well done, I will be back."}
{"text":"I was anticipating an extraordinary dinner and experience, but was let down. Our server seemed to pre-judge us and gave us terrible service. She seemed to be fake nice and barely did her job. She gave us the bread after she served our dinner, and never asked us how we like our food.  I hate going to a nice restaurant and getting crappy service. Our bill was $124 and we still have her $20 for bad service. If I had the guts to give her what she really deserved, I would have given her $5. 

I ordered the Spaghetti because I read other reviews of how good it was.
The pasta seemed like it was cooked way before they served it. I asked if they could make meatballs. They said yes. They served me tiny little meatballs, like from a Chef Boyardee can. 

All in all, the service was not up to par, the food was overpriced, and disappointing."}
{"text":"This was a solid 5 star meal for me and my two friends this past weekend. Firstly, our server was amazing. I'm a bit of a pain and he was patient and helpful and very professional. He had great advice, and was very understanding of my gluten allergy (and I was thrilled that they had a separate gluten free menu). Every dish ordered was an 'oh wow you gotta taste this\" moment. My friends said the stromboli bread basket with the choice of marscapone butter, lemon olive oil and eggplant caponata kicked off the night. Other standouts included the short rib agnolotti, polenta with mushroom ragout and the chocolate cake with almond gelato and salted caramel. Even the music was great. I had been hating being in Vegas- the riff-raff, over-designed spaces,  overpriced fussy but mediocre food, but this restaurant redeemed the trip. Note to the management- if you already have a gluten free menu why not put it on the website with the other menus?? I wish we had known about this place earlier."}
{"text":"The view----gorgeous. The setting, intimate, modern, subdued. The service, perfect. The food, nothing too surprising- good enough a quality, on par with my expectations, but didn't exceed it. Again though, the restaurant itself was so peaceful and powerfully refined, and this was itself a good enough reason for us, because its hard to find peace in Vegas. Whats nice about the restaurants at Cosmopolitan is each has its own character. And so depending on your mood, you can dial in what you prefer. 

If you stay at the hotel, everything is a breeze too coz their reservation line is all connected into your tv. Fancy.  The Cosmo has it up there with selection of good restaurants. You do have to pay for it, of course. Thats Cosmo. Its $$$, but they do it well."}
{"text":"Everything I hoped and dreamed. Our group of 12 was severely hungover from day drinking at Encore and most of us were struggling to just eat anything. I personally had to power through each bite just to keep it down but it was so worth it. Short rib and risotto app was phenomenal. Perfectly cooked risotto and short rib that just melted. But the real star was the spaghetti. I have been dying to try this forever. Truly life changing. Amazing al dente noodles enveloped in a rich and creamy tomato sauce with fresh basil folded in. It was heaven. I could eat that every day. Due to our state of being at the time, dessert was not an option but next time I will be definitely be indulging. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed dinner here with a few old friends I hadn't seen in a while! Our waiter Roberto was patient with us as we were so busy catching up we took a long time to look at the menu and order. Service was on point, professional, friendly, informative and unobtrusive. Every dish we tried was amazing! My favorites were the buratta salad and truffle sheep milk ravioli! My friends were speechless when they tried the short ribs with farro. The wine sommelier Paulo was very attentive and fun to talk to. Managers Mario and Kelly both stopped by the table to check on us and make sure every thing was perfect- which it was. Save room for dessert! The cheesecake was the best I have ever had! Highly recommend Scarpetto and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It was pretty much a perfect evening!

We celebrated our 11 year anniversary here & not sure why it look so long to get here as we've tried everything at The Cosmo except for this place! 

Walking in was a little awkward because you go down a very narrow space & pass the bar to get to the beautiful main dining room. It was the perfect combination of feminine & masculine which happens to be my favorite combo for any space! Lots of wood, very warm color palette yet there were sexy curves everywhere like the furniture, lighting & seating arrangements. Everything about the space was very beautiful. It felt like a man & woman got together to create it. 

The view of the Bellagio Fountains is always stunning as it never gets old for me and the service was on point. Thank you to our waiter for the complimentary champagne & dessert which was banana soufflé (AMAZING)!

Now for the carb overload ~ the classic spaghetti is popular as it should be because it was perfect. Fresh noodles, sweet sauce with a hint of basil & garlic. The famous polenta! WOW! Creamy heaven! The duck & foie gras ravioli was beyond decadent and then the short rib & bone marrow agnolotti (climax) I wanted to lick my plate! I was so full but I savored every single little bite as it's possibly one of the top dishes EVER! I still think about it...

Had a few cocktails as well & just sat back & enjoyed ourselves while watching the fountains. It was a beautiful evening & I cannot wait to go back! It's very rare to enjoy everything but I really did."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and it's been consistent. Serves different variety of breads along with tapenade and olive oil.   For large groups, they have a private dining room."}
{"text":"So disappointed! I have eaten here multiple times as a local. The Som, Kyle is GREAT, but for 3pp and  a $450 meal our service SUCKED! I walked in thinking of one specific pasta dish, that I absolutely adore! The server told me, \"no\" absolutely don't get that, pick something else without any reason.  I assumed it was because something was bad in the kitchen, chose something else, was completely unhappy but couldn't tell my server because he never came back to check on us. We were rushed to order because the kitchen was closing, then why did the restaurant allow a 10pm reservation???? We were rushed through our meal, and after appetizers our server didn't return until the table was clear to \"push us\" dessert. 

I haven't been this unhappy about a meal on the strip in a long time. They are getting 2 stars because of the Somm"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of pasta because I usually try to avoid carbs. I see it as a waste of valuable tummy space that I should reserve for other food. BUT I have to give it to Scarpetta for changing my mind.

We came here in a group of six on a Sunday night. We made reservations like two hours prior, but we showed up about an hour early and were seated immediately. 

Right away, we were impressed by the variety of the bread basket and the dips. I can't remember exactly but there were about six different types of bread. What really got our attention though was the eggplant dipping sauce! It was so yummy that we kept shamelessly asking for more. I think we got at least three refills of it (but hey, we had six hungry girls!).

On to the real food... My friend and I shared the Lobster Pici and the Short Rib and bone marrow agnolotti. The pici is dressed with a chili pesto sauce, and since my friend can't eat spicy foods, they split the portion for us and served it on two separate plates. I got extra chili pesto on the side in case I wanted to add more. I loved that we didn't have to try and split our dish in half ourselves. So much more convenient and I can get straight down to eating! However, it turns out that the chili pesto sauce isn't even spicy at all. If anything, it's just salty, like REALLY salty. The pieces of lobster meat still tasted good and wasn't that salty, but the pasta sat directly in the pesto and it definitely could've used less sauce/salt.

Now on to the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti... it was the last entree to come out! All the food came out already and the agnolotti was nowhere to be seen. We got sidetracked by the lobster pici and kind of forgot about our 2nd entree to share. When we realized, we asked the server where it was and if the kitchen had forgotten about it, but he assured us it will be coming out shortly. By the time it came out, everyone was done with their food. I'd say it came out 10-15 mins later than the other entrees. It wasn't so bad considering we were sharing another entree, but had we not shared, one of us would've sat there without food. Considering this is a fine dining restaurant, that is unacceptable. 

But you know what, it was so delicious that I didn't care it was late. I think this has become my favorite pasta dish of all time. The flavor was very rich and smooth, with a little crunchy texture from the garlic chips. I personally liked it better than the duck and foie gras ravioli that I tried from my friend's plate. I would order this again and again. Luckily for me, there's also a Scarpetta in NY! Guess where I'll be going to dinner soon!"}
{"text":"Food was good and a great view of the bellagio fountains.  Service was on point.   Good spot for a date.  Worth spending a little more and skipping docg."}
{"text":"If I come here again, I'll just take two of the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli.  The pasta is shaped like a duck's tongue. It has balsamic reduction on top. If you like foie gras, you'd enjoy this. Keep the sauce and dip it with the complimentary bread.  

We got a couple of other plates, but honestly, I don't remember!"}
{"text":"One of the very few (if not the only one) restaurants on the strip where the Vegas location is a LOT better than the one in NYC. Scarpetta LV is light years ahead of its namesake in Manhattan's Meatpacking district. 
The service is, without a question, much better here than in NYC and so was the food. Scarpetta NYC, on the other hand, has a quirkier, much more interesting wine list featuring Italian wines exclusively. 
So, I guess you'd have to visit both locations and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"For the price I am not impressed with the service. I like to be honest in my reviews and I honestly feel that for the price we are paying for fine dining. We were seated and waited 15 minutes to get our menus. Food took forever to get :( 

Food finally came and was definitely a 4 out of 5 but I have to drop the rating due to the poor service."}
{"text":"It was my first time actually being treated out to such a fancy restaurant , and it was absolutely amazing ! We had our own private room with a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains which made our meal extra special. The ambiance was very romantic and dimly lit. I recall having more than one server , but Titus was very personable , he was great. I ordered their creamy polenta and spaghetti based on reviews and they did not disappoint ! Their short rib agnolotti was fantastic as well. We also ordered a variety of desserts , and the winter parfait was our favorite out of everything. I felt that the food portions were just right. The food was really expensive , but that is the price you pay for for the fine dining experience and being on the Strip/Cosmopolitan."}
{"text":"A hotel contact set me up for dinner here on a Friday night after a long day of touring venues for work.

Finally it was time to unwind!

The dining room is dimly lit and a great place for a special occasion/ or pre show dinner with your significant other.

Our server was quite nice, and attentive.

I was in the mood for some bivalves and got 1/2  a dozen. They were really small and disappointing and not really the best that I've had.

We also had the beef tartare which was also quite good, but not as good as the one at BIX in SF. 

For entrees the husband had a ban seared fish, what type of fish it evades me, but it was cooked perfectly; crispy on the outside, soft and moist inside.

I had the lobster pasta of some sort, very rich and al dente,  I could certainly taste the flavor of the fresh herbs used in the butter sauce. I shared this with the husband and he thoroughly enjoyed it.

The highlight was the fish entree and also the desserts.

We had the trio of bombolini-some kind of fried dough/beignets looking things. But when we bit into them, they had this glorious melted chocolate inside! Every fried bit of goodness had a different filling, one chocolate, the other custard, and I forget what the other ones, but they were fried bites of perfection!  It had nutella and vanilla creme inside. Yummy!

The other dessert was this fruit and creme concoction, sorry the name escapes my mind but it was definetely really good and really rich. 

The server made a mistake and gave us a third dessert- the chocolate molten cake. It was also super good but by that time we were desserted out. 

I don't know what the bill was as it was comped but I imagine maybe $150 for two with a glass of wine. Not bad for some really good bites and sinful dessert to go with it!


I would recommend if staying at the cosmos."}
{"text":"When you are in Las Vegas you have more choices for great food than anywhere else in the U.S. sorry New York but let's be honest some food there sucks.

This place is a for sure try.  The Caesar salad is fantastic.... The bread you get before your meal comes with 3 dipping sauces and is a nice touch.

A wide variety of gourmet dished with the chicken being my favorite."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Food at its finest. We had the tasting menu and wine pairing and I would have paid triple for this experience. The service was professional and flawless. The food can only be described as art!  Texture, taste, and creativity are in every bite.  Wow!  This is bucket list worthy!  Check my other reviews, I am generally not this kind."}
{"text":"What do you have to do to make a reservation for a group here?  I've called reservations they said I had to call group reservations which I have a few times. Nobody ever answers so left messages. It's been a week and no return call?  If you can't accommodate me then at least return my call and tell me.  Ate here last year and the food was great but service/management clearly lacking."}
{"text":"We were there on Sunday night and I was looking forward to eating there after seeing the place a few times. Went with a small group and the place was busy but not full. They were out of 2 main entree items and it took 1 hour to get our order. The server did not acknowledge the slow service nor was anything offered to us by the restaurant for the delayed meals.  Pizza was good but it did not outweigh the poor service.  I will not return nor will I recommend or encourage others to try it."}
{"text":"Scarpetta is a dark, intimate, upscale Italian restaurant with nice views of the Strip and the Bellagio fountains in the distance.  We had some really good dishes here and would definitely recommend, especially if you like seafood with pasta.  Service was friendly but timing a bit off with the fish coming out way before our pasta dish and them forgetting about our side dish.  Still, solid 4 stars!

Their free bread basket is one of the best - nice variety of plain and some with some nice, Mediterranean-inspired filling. You get a triple-dip tray of olive oil, a savory tapenade, and mascarpone! 

The Berry Smash cocktail is sweet with the mix of blueberries and white cranberry juice.  It goes down smoothy but a few minutes you will get the buzz!  

For apps, we shared the grilled octopus. It was tender, well-seasoned of course and what made this dish a winner is that their olives and potato condiments also had a nice balanced taste. Olives not too briny nor salty - just perfect.

I got the Branzino with saffron broth, a pretty good dish albeit on the lighter side.  It had some nice clams and shrimp pieces to go with the fish, which was cooked perfectly and seasoned enough for me.

My wife's black pasta dish with sea urchin and crabmeat however, was outstanding.  It looked super rich and tiny at first, but after mixing everything up it turned out to be very filling. Best of all, it wasn't super rich.  This has got to be one of their signature dishes - why need sauce when uni and crab meat are already perfect together.

For dessert we shared the mascarpone cheesecake and Greek Yogurt (sorbet?).  Excellent dish that easily feeds two.  We dislike dense cheesecake that tends to be too heavy and rich, but Scarpetta's version was light and smooth.  It almost had a panna cotta texture.  The Greek Yogurt was sweet and chilled and reminded us more like a side of ice cream. No reason you can't make a sorbet or have Greek Froyo I suppose. Wonderful dessert, and perfect end to a great dinner."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here alone last night at the bar.  When they first opened a former BF and I ate here in the dinning room.  Although the food was amazing the first time, I think the dinning room is not configured well for romance.  Tables are close, like cafeteria kind of close.  In addition the service was just a disconnect...  But let's discuss this visit.  
Amazing.  Sat at the bar and got phenomenal treatment from the bartender.  As all the parties paraded by or waited for the tables, the bar staff not only took care of those folks but some how made me feel i was not eating my dinner in a waiting area.  I started with the roasted Scallops YUMMMMMMM.  Then I had the most magnificent piece of red meat that has ever passed between these lips...  Kobe Rib Cap.  Oh glorious rib cap.  Never have I had entire plate of rib cap,  In fact I had to Google it to know what it was.  Worth the effort to research and read up on it.  LOVE LOVE LOVE.

So amazing service, great cocktails, nice wine selection and the best steak I have ever eaten.

My new favorite."}
{"text":"This low-lit place is very classy and romantic. The service was excellent. Our food came out pretty quickly after we ordered. And there are seats next to the window with a nice view of part of the strip.  

The food:
-Complimentary bread: A real breadwinner! There was an assortment of breads that were warm and delicious: focaccia with rosemary, one with mozarella baked into it, one with salami, one with a leafy green in it, and bite-sized one that were crunchy. The bread comes with softened butter (it was so soft), an eggplant tomato sauce, and an olive oil-based dip. 
-Duck and foie gras ravioli: It was delicious. It was plentiful and full of flavor.
-Endive salad with beets: My gf really enjoyed this. It was presented very well. It had a nice, slightly bitter taste that was well-complimented by the sweetness of the beets that were on the side."}
{"text":"Like almost any restaurant, Scarpetta has its pros and cons. Let's start with the positives.

Ambience: when you walk in you have to go through the bar to get to the dining room. The bar is long and narrow. It is quite inviting and incredibly attractive. They have small alcoves that seat two on the right hand side that would make a wonderful place to come to have a romantic drink before your evening starts. The main dining room is also beautifully decorated. If you were lucky enough to get a seat by the window, you have a terrific you of the Bellagio fountains as well as looking down the Las Vegas Boulevard Strip. The tables are very nicely spaced so that you can have quiet conversation with the friends with whom you are dining and not be bothered by conversations from other tables. 

Food: the meal starts with a small basket of breads placed on the center of the table. If it were possible to have a \"bread orgasm\",  then the four of us had that shared experience on eating the breads. Wow, it was that good! We decided we would share the Pici ( normally a main course) as an appetizer for the four of us. This dish was incredibly good. It consisted of a green pasta cooked al dante with a generous portion of lobster meat mixed in. The sauce was a bit spicy but it was delicious. I had the New York strip steak as my main course. The quality of the meat was really mediocre even though it was cooked appropriately. I expected it to be much better in a high end restaurant. It came with some vegetables that were delicious. In addition we ordered a side of mushrooms for the table. This too was incredibly delicious. We shared a chocolate cake for dessert. The chocolate cake was a rich dark chocolate with a small scoop of gelato on top. The cake made me feel as if I had died and gone to heaven.
Service: while our waiter did nothing wrong, he certainly did nothing to make us feel welcome. The service runners brought the food in a timely fashion although it was a little surprising that they did not know who was supposed to get which dish. The bus boy was it quite good. Our water glasses never got below half full."}
{"text":"Las Vegas is my least popular destination in the US, but business takes me here twice a year. I visited Scarpetta for a business dinner today and I'm effusive about the experience. The food and service were absolutely sublime.

The menu was a culinary tour of pleasures with a full palate of distinctive flavors. Everything I sampled was exquisite.

Simply put: Scarpetta is an extraordinary restaurant that I would recommend wholeheartedly.

Understand that it's a premium price for a premium product, but well worth the money."}
{"text":"The entire experience was wonderful. The waitstaff was charming and attentive and very well informed about their food. When I mentioned I was vegetarian, I was provided with a special vegetarian menu, with a couple of additional items not on the regular menu. (this is not exactly a positive. Put all your dishes on the menu. I mean, you aren't actually starting to cook your farro for the farro risotto when a random vegetarian offers it, right?)

I was drawn to the restaurant by the marketing copy. (it's impressive!) The burrata salad made me add it to my very short -must-try-while-in-Vegas list. And it did not disappoint. I have a running pet peeve about chintzy servings of burrata, and this is possibly the first place I've eaten that provided a balanced proportion of tomato and burrata. The variety of heirloom tomatoes, served roasted, and fresh, was a wonderful surprise. And there was enough burrata (lightly salted with shaved crystal salt) for every bite of the dish. Divine.

Two other stellar standouts (aside from the view of the Bellagio fountain show) were the olive oil served with the table bread-- some of the best I've ever had-- and the dessert. We split the Bomboloni, and it was divine. My description will not do it justice, but I'll try. Essentially, 5 small donuts covered in crystal sugar, and filled with Nutella, served with a heavenly banana gelato.

All that, and in a peaceful oasis of a casino hotel that barely forces you to cross the casino floor, and makes it easy to enter and leave the building. I'll be back, should I find myself in Vegas ever again."}
{"text":"After having a great experience at D.O.C.G., I will really excited to dine at Scarpetta.  However, I walked away a bit underwhelmed by the food.  BUT the view of the Bellagio fountains at sundown was fantastic and the service was the best I have had anywhere.  We had half a dozen oysters to start with, duck foie gras ravioli, and truffled pasta.  The first bite was very good but after that everything was very one-noted and boring.  Taste buds were not enthused by the end of dinner.  While the staff was VERY good the service can get slow.  We almost missed our 10:30pm show as we were at dinner for over 2 hours. My only regret is that I should have tried the Spaghetti!"}
{"text":"My husband took me here and I fell in love with the food and atmosphere. Their pea soup is to die for. And they have a great sommelier. I love coming here and highly recommend it for any special night out or even just to try the food for all the foodies out there."}
{"text":"Loved their Pici entree --- green pasta in a pesto spicy sauce with lobster. And of course their spaghetti pasta is delicious.  I had their squid and octopus appetizer with fennel and was pleasantly surprised.  

Ordered a Manhattan on the rocks and they gave me a big serving .. more than what I expected which was awesome.  Definitely coming back here again when in town.  Prices are comparable or cheaper than other fine dining restaurants in the top swank hotels on the strip."}
{"text":"A fantastic restaurant. A very unique dining room with spectacular views of the Bellagio fountain. The design of the dining room is open and not your traditional tables lined up next to one another. The food is sensational. The portions are on the smaller side - but that was refreshing considering the ounces and ounces of steak i had during my Vegas trip. The pasts dishes are exquisite and the sashimi was perfect. The bar scene was non existent on the Saturday night i was there, but the dining room had a great pulse. I recommend a pre dinner drink at the many cool spots of the Cosmopolitan Hotel and then come enjoy a fantastic meal at Scarpetta."}
{"text":"Great food and good portions for a light eater. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Thank you for having real Italian food in Vegas worth the price! It's in the Cosmopolitan. 

FOOD:
Complimentary bread: Good variety, soft, addicting. 

Truffle Polenta (5): OMG can I have you every day. I could have left after just eating this and been so happy. So creamy and flavorful. Truffle flavor came out so well, and the extra crunch you get from the mushrooms made it perfect. Gorgeous dish also. 

Special-Cheese ravioli with black truffles (5 stars): Had to get the special since I love black truffles. They shave on a good amount too. The ravioli was really good and the black truffles and foam made it amazing. Very filling. 

Chicken Entree (5 stars): So moist and flavorful. Seasoned almost like Mediterranean/Indian chicken. Really liked it.

VIEW/ATMOSPHERE (5 stars)
Sat right against the window and saw the beautiful Bellagio fountains go up every 15 minutes. Gorgeous. Definitely request the window seats if you can. The place itself is nice and quiet. Great for a date night. 

SERVICE (5 stars)
Girls who work at the front are both beautiful and nice! I was in heels and she warned me as I was walking that the back area was slippery, which it was! So if she didn't warn me I probably would have ate it. And the waiters were on top of everything and nice too."}
{"text":"One of the best meals of my life.

I will preface the review by saying that we got the supreme hook up.  I am an acquaintance of Chef Dan Rossi and he saw to it that we experienced Scarpetta to the fullest.  A huge thank you again to Chef Dan and his hospitality and talented team.

The atmosphere: Sleek, elegant, and sexy are the first words that come to mind.  The sound track puts you in the right mood but doesn't overwhelm.  One of the few hot spots in Vegas where you don't have to shout to your dinner companions- I greatly appreciated this.  It is warm and inviting with these great S shaped booths.  Yes, the waiters appear over your sholder when you're dining at the booths, but I didnt really mind that.

The food: I do not exagerate, one of the best meals of my life!
A break down-
Polenta with mushrooms- I could have drank that sauce and been satisfied, my bf who doesnt even like polenta went back for seconds and thirds!
Heirloom tomato salad- simple, clean, delicious
Yellowtail carpaccio- i dont know how they get fish this fresh in Vegas! Light citrusy sauce with some crunch from the salt on top. Perfection.
Short ribs- I dont usually eat meat but when i saw that these babies basically fall off the bone as soon as a fork comes near, i had to try.

Taglietelle with veggies and truffle cream- this is not a light dish! The homemade pasta is cooked to a perfect al dente and the sauce is everything that something with truffles should be.  My bf's fave of the night.
Short rib ravioli- a special that night.  Again, I'm vegetarian and this was my fave dish.  It its offered when you go, dont miss it.

Branzino with leeks and asparagus- light and refreshing after the heavier pastas.  Crispy skin on the fish. Leeks roasted till they carmelized.  I could eat this every night and be a happy girl.

Gingerbread and pear tarte with cinnamon gelato- ORDER IT!!!!

I'm not usually this long winded in reviews but I was just so happy with the entire evening.  In addition wines by the glass are generously poured and therefore worth the steep-ish price.  I'd recommend this as a place for couples, non-rowdy bday parties, and those looking for an elegant evening without a bass infused club sound track.

Thank you, thank you Chef Rossi."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome! Service was good. Booked through open table. One of the best 3 course meals I had in Vegas ! I came here with my sister for a nice dinner. Bread basket was so good I wanted more, it came with butter, eggplant spread and olive oil. Each of the bread was different. They put it in layers and it was warm. We ordered the yellow tail, short rib agnolotti and fennel black cod. We were able to sit near the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. We ordered cocktails as well. I got the berry smash it was fruity but not too sweet just the right bite of alcohol. My sis got the scarpetta  Cosmo it was equally delightful. There was no room for dessert we were both full. I like also how they split our dishes because we were sharing. I want to go back for more and try other pastas as well."}
{"text":"Came here after our vow renewal.  We had a great view of the fountains, our server was very nice and had no problem getting a new salad for my friend who did not like the one she originally ordered.  Drinks were about average priced for any nice place in vegas, avg. $16 each. My friend got a cosmo and she said it was perfect.  They had a good bourbon selection for my picky husband.  I got the branzino and it was very good. My husband got the waygu cap steak that was on special and loved it! Still talking about it.  I think it was about $65, it filled him up. We did not get salad (extra, not inculded). My friend got a caesar and it was beautiful! Loved the presentation.  They both get the filet and they said it was perfect.  Tip, 2 entrees and I think 2 drinks was $156. Not the most we have spent on a meal.  FYI for weddings, they charge between $6- $13 per person to bring in your own cake."}
{"text":"Very romantic atmosphere, great food, excellent service! I had the polenta which I didn't want to stop eating. I also had the spaghetti and I don't know how some people gave it bad reviews. I would come again just for the spaghetti, it was perfect. My husband had the fois gras and said it was the best he's had, as well as the halibut. For dessert we finished with the Nutella bomboloni, yum! The view of the bellagio fountains was a nice addition."}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner here 2 weeks ago--much anticipation given the Chef behind the restaurant!

Host staff was very pleasant--we were seated immediately at our table which had a decent view of the water-show at neighboring Bellagio.  The adult beverages were VERY good, and wait staff was excellent and well-informed about the menu.  One of our party was newly enamored of a drink she had previously had at the Chandelier bar at this same hotel--they did not have this drink at Scarpetta--but our waiter discussed it with the bartender and they came up with an excellent version of the cocktail--which may have surpassed the original!

I agree with the prior comments about the bread basket--the bread with the salami was the best thing we ate all night.

We ordered many things off of the menu--from the basic spaghetti to the seafood pasta--all of it was served very quickly and at proper temperature, etc, and presentation was great.   The pasta portion of the seafood pasta was overdone, but the rest of the meals were very good (though nothing I would say we had to go back for, except that bread!).

Desert was basic and boring--nothing exciting.

Overall the ambience was great--excellent place for date night, drinks, and decent food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this scarpetta :( the view is beautiful but the service is bad and the food was cold!"}
{"text":"Came here while on a business trip with a friend. The atmosphere is super romantic and definitely high class. I ordered the sea bass which was divine. I just wish there were more options that didn't include pasta. I know Italians are famous for their pasta but c'mon, pasta isn't the only food they are famous for... and what.... there are no low carb Italian dieters??? If that's the case their workout regimen must be intense AF. I will definitely come back.. but on a cheat day :)"}
{"text":"I'm almost surprised that the complementary bread isn't a menu item in itself...it was that good.  But let's not forget the rest of the menu.  During our visit we enjoyed the Mediterranean Octopus, Short-Rib Agnolotti and the Pici.  Everything was awesome, but the standout was the Pici...I'd almost go all the way back to LV just for that alone!  OMG!"}
{"text":"Came here with my bf on my recent vegas stay.

I ordered the duck & foie gras ravioli.......
the best morsel I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Handsome and I are celebrating our annual Vegas trip this weekend and this review is a year overdue!! 

We stayed at The Cosmopolitan and we really wanted to eat at Scarpetta. We love Chopped and Scott Conant is one of our favorites. His restaurant is located on the third level of The Cosmo. 

We walked in and we had a reservation so we were seated promptly right by the window and we could see The Bellagio fountain. It was so romantic. 

We ordered wine (I don't remember which one) but it was amazing. For our starter we got The Yellowtail and The Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli. Both were spectacular. 

For dinner Handsome ordered The Veal Three ways and I ordered The Pan Roasted Halibut. Handsome loved his veal and my halibut melted in my mouth.

For dessert we orders the Rhubarb Soufflé and I think that was Handsome's favorite part. It was so light and fluffy with such a delicious flavor. 

Our whole experience at Scarpetta was amazing from start to finish. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'd give it more stars if I could. I've been to both the LV and the BH locations and it's definitely one of my favorite restaurants on Earth. From the bread basket to the agnolotti to the famous spaghetti to the caramel budino to the gorgeous view -- it's all simply amazing. The service is wonderful which makes the experience even better. I make a stop every time I'm in Vegas and I hope to try his other locations too!"}
{"text":"I thought Scarpetta was supposed to be a step up from DOCG, but unfortunately found it to be the opposite. Have had several great experiences at DOCG, but rather than topping it, Scarpetta didn't even compare.

STARTERS
BREAD BASKET: Five types of bread (the olive-studded one and the rolled spinach and cheese were favorites) and three dipping sauces (really liked the tomato tapenade, lemon olive oil was aromatic).
RAW YELLOWTAIL ($18): Four thin slices of yellowtail sashimi, accented with ginger oil and red onion, and what seemed to be sea salt? Liked it but not worth the price.
ENGLISH PEA SOUP ($19): Much better than the version at Giada's. I liked the mint accents and flavorful rock shrimp, though there could have been more of it. Note that this is a hot soup, not chilled.
MEDITERRANEAN OCTOPUS: Not the best version I've had but good, I liked that it was a pretty plate formed using one whole octopus tentacle rather than pieces as elsewhere. This is plated with ceci beans and what seemed to be hummus. 

PASTAS
SPAGHETTI: BF's pick, and his favorite for the night. Classic but well-made spaghetti with tomato and basil. I agree with another reviewer who said this dish tasted like the pasta version of a margherita pizza.
ORECCHIETTI: \"Little ears\" pasta with broccoli rabe and a house-made sausage. Neither of us really cared for this and wished we had opted to split one of the fish entrees instead. Note that this was on the night's menu in place of the gnocchetti sardi on the online menu.
AGNOLOTTI: Short rib, brown butter, and horseradish bread crumbs. Ordered this dish because it was one most recommended in reviews. It was rich and I enjoyed the actual pasta, but the combination of flavors didn't especially work for me. 

DESSERTS
CAPPUCCINO: Very well made, no bitterness or acidity or burned taste at all, just pure, strong coffee, and a ton of foam. 
STRAWBERRY SOUFFLE: Another dish that was significantly better than one I had at Giada's (hers was lemon flavored). This was like eating a cloud, it was so perfectly executed. The strawberry gelato was among the most flavorful versions I've had, and the fresh strawberry accents were so ripe that this dish didn't need the accompanying creme fraiche. 
AMEDEI CHOCOLATE CAKE: For the chocolate-lover. This was extremely rich and dense, more like a brownie than a cake. The almond gelato had almonds on top for texture, which we liked, but the flavor of the salted caramel sauce was minimal and the cake itself was a bit overcooked and hard.

The appetizers were okay, the pastas were okay, and the desserts were okay. As I left, I wished I'd just gone next door to get the incredible salted caramel bundino at DOCG, which blows both of the desserts we had here out of the water.

Service was attentive, and I appreciate that we were able to get a seat in the second row from the windows even with a last-minute reservation. Location is dark and romantic, making photos nearly impossible (and largely inappropriate). Overall quality of food was less than expected. I'll be returning to DOCG instead, even though it is more casual... they have a better wine list, too."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying I am loving the Thompson hotel lounges and restaurants however, Scarpetta, for the price that comes with the food, isn't overly worth it. The Spaghetti which is comprised of sauce and oil is $24. A bit too much for the portion as well.

The atmosphere is that of a nice hotel restaurant and the servers are pleasant although a bit lacking in attention to detail. The woman across from us was using a napkin that the server had spilled wine on and it wasn't until someone at our table informed them that they went and got a new one. Also when it came time to paying, we all had separate forms of payment and my girlfriend was over charged and when they went to fix it, they recharged the same amount to her CC (3 times this carried on!)

I did enjoy the meal however and their bartender sure does know how to mix a cocktail. I would suggest going to the lobby bar and having a cocktail. I would also suggest getting the meat stuffed olives (they are lip smacking delish!)"}
{"text":"Scarpetta's ambiance is so nice!  The decor is beautiful and romantic.  We had great drinks at the bar and when we were seated for dinner we had a view of the Bellagio fountain show.  I went with my husband and we are both vegetarian.  It was great to see that they had a separate veggie menu to choose from.  We ordered the artichoke soup, risotto, spaghetti, and donut dessert dish.  It was all so delicious.  Our server was superb and very attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"Delicious and varietal bread basket!
Butternut squash soup delicious
Chicken; juicy, moist, tender - a little salty.
Short rib pasta..  raviolis with short rib inside.  Kinda like a way better version of chef boy-r-dee ravoilis.
All food was a tad bit salty but overall pretty delicious.  I would go back.  We had an intimate booth for two in the lounge which was pretty romantic!"}
{"text":"Simply put Scarpetta is my favorite Vegas restaurant. 
I've been a few times and each time I've left as satisfied as possible. 

For an appetizer, I've had the squash soup, the tuna susci, and braised short ribs. The squash soup is some of the best I've ever had. The tuna was good but I wouldn't get it again. The braised short ribs were perfect and while I have no idea what was in that sauce, it was heavenly. Probably will get the braised short ribs the next few times I go.

As for entrees, they are famous for their duck and foie gras ravioli and believe me, it lives up to the loftiest of expectations. It's such a unique dish and the duck and foie gras compliment each other perfectly. It doesn't feel too heavy, goes down sooooo smoothly and has this great sauce on top with just the perfect amount of cheese. Ive had it multiple times and plan on getting it again in the future. 
I've also had the short rib agnolottie which is almost as superb. The short rib is great and you get this really tasty hint of horseradish in the sauce. It's far from overwhelming, just a hint of it, but after a full plate of the agnolotti, you can certainly tell its there. But it doesn't take away from the dish, the short rib and pasta are both great.
While I've not tried the black cod or the steak, my companions have and they have reported being very happy with their choices.

Oddly enough, I've not had dessert at Scarpetta. Maybe in the future I will, I'm sure it will be tasty.

A few other things to note: the view is superb, definitely ask for a window seat and you'll get a side view of the bellagio fountains. It's just a matter of luck and if they have a table available, ask when you make the reservation. The portions are great. So often Vegas portions (especially at nice restaurants) are so small, but these are adequate and leaves you filling full but not overly full (as often dishes are so heavy with fat and cream and such). The price is very appropriate. Nothing is exorbitantly pricy, nothing is cheap, the price is correct."}
{"text":"Great views, delicious food, very nice waiter!!! My bf(now fiancé) took me to dinner here and proposed!! Everything was perfect. First off, I'm a bread lover and their bread basket is by far the best I have ever had!!!! We tried the short rib appetizer-very good! I had the spaghetti for my meal-it was amazing! My fiancé had the special of the day which was a seafood pasta with crab, a lemon sauce and breadcrumbs-he really enjoyed it!! They also gave us champagne and a cookie assortment as a congratulations!!! ALL DELISH!! Definitely a must try!!"}
{"text":"After much research on where to dine for our five year wedding anniversary, my husband and I decided on Scarpetta. The menu looked delicious and the prices weren't outrageous. We called about three weeks in advance to make our reservation for seven people. I was surprised that they only had one time left but was very happy we were able to get in at 7:30pm. We were all super excited to dine there. I tweeted about it and they even tweeted back at me, which I thought was a nice touch. 

We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and only had to wait about five minutes for a table. We were hoping for a table by the window but didn't get one. We were near the wine wall but could still see the Bellagio fountains. 

I'll break this review into two parts.

SERVICE:
I'd never been to a higher end restaurant like this before, so I was expecting exceptional service like I had never previously received. While the service was very good, it didn't live up to my expectations. Our waiter was a really nice guy, but I think he might have been newer because he seemed a little bit awkward and shy. Also, I asked him to take a picture of our whole group and he forgot. Then two people had to leave so when he finally did take the pic, not everyone was there. There was another man (Paul?) who was in charge of the wine and he was another story. He was so suave and charming. I wish he could have been our waiter! There was a major glitch in our evening considering the type of place we were at. We receieved our bill, and as we were looking over it we realized they put two $125 bottles of wine on it rather than just the one. I'm glad we noticed, because that's a fairly big mistake to make. Service in general was on the slower side. There were many gaps where nobody came to our table. We were there for about two hours. The guy refilling the water glasses was really nice, though.

FOOD:
Between the seven of us, we ordered:
-Crispy fritto misto (x2)
-Heirloom tomato salad
-Creamy polenta
-Tagliatelle (x2) (this is what I ordered)
-Duck and foie gras ravioli
-Spaghetti
-Pea tortelli
-I know I'm missing one, but I can't remember/obviously didn't try a bite.

I had bites of everything and it was all delicious. Of course, the bread starter was fantastic. The polenta was great and rich. The ravioli was so rich, I wouldn't have been able to eat it as my main dish. It was also incredibly salty. It might be nice in a smaller size as a starter. The vegetables in my tagliatelle were super fresh - such a difference fresh veggies make! The spaghetti was very good, fresh and delicious, but it didn't knock my socks off like it has for some other people. Of all of the pastas I tried, I would order the pea tortelli next time. The portion sizes are not large, but just a nice amount to leave you satisfied and not bursting. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice. Not as intimate as I wanted, but I think we would have had to spend more somewhere else for that. I was sort of surprised that there were a lot of skimpily dressed stagettes and dudes in t-shirts and BASEBALL HATS! 

We had a very good experience here but it just fell a bit short of my expectations based on the many other reviews I read."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 
So hip. Great lighting. 

Dishes: 
-Oysters (Appetizer): Classic. Good. Perfect start. 
-Braised Short Ribs of Beef (Appetizer): YUMBERS. The meat is so tender. Risotto was perfectly cooked and tasty, and I don't usually like risotto.
-Halibut (Entree): Cooked to perfection. Asparagus, mushrooms, and potatoes were salted well. YUM
-Nutella & Vanilla Bomboloni (Dessert): Basically nutella filled donut holes coated in sugar, with a side of banana gelato. So good, will try to recreate this at home.

Drinks:
-Billionaire: Absinthe, need I say more
-Berry Smash (or something like that): If you don't like acid-y drinks, this is for you. 

tldr: Every time I go back to Vegas, I'll always have a dinner here."}
{"text":"This place is really a gem.  The food is excellent (particularly the banana nutella dessert and the lamb) and the service is top notch.  Also, the restaurant has beautiful views of both the strip and the Bellagio fountains.  Overall, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This meal was pretty average, so I'm not sure what the hype is about here. Everyone raves about the spaghetti, but it's nothing special. Neither is the service given how disinterested the waiters seemed. The best part of the meal was the drink and the view of the fountains (though you can get a better view from restaurants at the Bellagio or from a fountain-view terrace room). Probably will not return."}
{"text":"The Scarpetta brand is renowned for exceptional food and service. The NYC meatpacking location is one of my faves, so I was VERY excited to try the Vegas one. How silly of me to forget that EVERYTHING IS BETTER IN VEGAS. Here we go...


I had the MOST delicious pasta course I've ever had in my entire life. It was short rib ravioli with a balsamic reduction. I try, TRY! not eat bread except when I'm at a restaurant like Scarpetta. Then I will destroy the bread basket and order a refill. I'm gross but if I finally get carbs, I'm going hog wild. Oink.

Onto the entrees and wine. Pete had the Osso Buco and thought it was good. I had the branzino. I don't remember the sides, not to say they were forgettable, we were just so obsessed with the ravioli appetizer. The wine was great, as was the service. Expensive AF and make sure you make a reservation."}
{"text":"this place was so disappointing. i based my selection of this restaurant on the number of yelp reviews it received and what others commented about it. the quality of the food was not that great and we ordered a totally overpriced bottle of wine. this was a visit for a bachelorette dinner and everyone, including the bride, were unimpressed by the food. who has been posting these rave reviews...?
i would not return. 
the only pro that this restaurant has is the wonderful view from the dining room. other than that, service was as expected, but the food really did not shine. short ribs that were highly recommended by the server were just ok. meh."}
{"text":"Interesting menu items and unique tastes accompanied by a strong wine list makes this a definite 4 star.  The menu is a little limited and the a bit pricey especially for the beef/steaks.  I was very impressed with the wait staff's knowledge and recommendations.  He wasn't shy about recommendations and potential wine pairings.  Very knowledgeable.  

Something to consider - The six course meal with wine pairings looks great and the wine recommendations looked very good."}
{"text":"Is it just me or did I miss something? 

We had a late dinner, and since Raku was booked we opted to try here. It's romantic and intimate, but I left feeling disappointed. 

Braised Short Ribs of Beef - It was good, the short rib was braised well although a bit salty. I didn't really understand or like farro risotto. 

Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli - I like Foie, but I just wasn't a fan of this. The texture reminds me of cow brains. It is also very rich. 

Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti - This was OK, but nothing spectacular. It was also a bit rich, and the horseradish was a bit too much at times. 

Mediterranean Orata - The seared fish was good, but nothing too special. Fish was almost too slimy. 

After reading all these great reviews, I'm starting to feel like I missed something. I'm not sure if it's my palate or if the food is just overrated? Everything I tried was really rich in flavor, and I left both pastas half finished. Maybe I went in expecting too much? If anyone feels the same as, please let me know. I can't be the only person that feels this way right? 

Service was good, except the host looked like she wanted to go home badly."}
{"text":"THE HYPE IS REAL! 

TL;DR: must try: creamy polenta with truffles mushroom; spaghetti and the mascarpone cheesecake. 

We went during the restaurant week and everything was SO good! If I'm stranded on an island and can only eat one thing for the rest of my life, I'd pick that polenta. The cheesecake was made from mascarpone, so it's not heavy like the New York cheesecake but A LOT smoother and creamier. In fact, probably the smoothest and creamiest I've ever had. 

I also love the design of the restaurant. Intimate, not too loud, has a glass wall facing the Bellagio fountain show and seemingly much larger tables than other fine dining places (lol). I also noticed a couple semi-private rooms for larger groups and events.

Edits: almost forgot about the bread basket. They had like 6 different breads with all kinds of flavors and textures. Never thought that I would be craving for some broccoli bread."}
{"text":"There are some more favorable seats, definitely grab a booth or something by the window to view Bellagio's fountains, unfortunately due to the proportions of my body, I had to peep over or under the metal strip on the window.  

Great Italian wine variatels by the glass: Falaghina, Vermentino & Rosso Di Montalc.

Eats:
*Complimentary bread is a meal in itself, there is a selection with salami and cheese between excellent toasty bread.  The accompaniments were housemade, mascapone butter and marinated eggplants.
*Waygu Beef Tartare, cured egg, parmigiano, toasted hazelnuts & sea salt, the nuts were a unique touch, flavors were delicate & clean, the beef shined
*Duck Foie Gras Ravioli, lovely marsala reduction, the filling was so heavenly, but I thought the pasta was a little thick
*Black Farfalle, lobster, bread crumbs, perfectly al dente pasta, sweet generous pieces of the crustacean
*Branzino, leeks, white asparagus, pine nuts and gremolata, LOVED this dish, crisp skin and nicely cooked flesh.  
*Aged Sirloin Beef, gnocchi, wild mushrooms, parmigiano & ragu, rich, hearty and robust flavors, the cut of beef could have been better

Wish there was a green leafy salad, the only thing I spied was the heirloom mozzarella.  Doesn't cut it for me.

Seamless service and solid food, one of the better choices for Italian on the Strip, the ambiance is there, if you want to go purely for food, Batali or bust."}
{"text":"Amazing food particularly the burrata, scallops and steak with potato gnocchi very delicious. The amazing service was provided by Jason and Adriana tonight who took great care of my friend and I. I will come back again!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. I come here lookong to have a great time and i am rushed thru the entire experience. First i was asked if i wanted an appetizer within minutes of getting the menu we orderd and within 5 minutes the food was on the table befor our drinks or even the bread was on the table. We then orderd dinner and that showed up within out last bites. We were only there for a total of 45 minutes.  If you like being rushed thru dinner this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We picked Scarpetta for our 25th wedding anniversary dinner based on the menu.  We are so glad we did!!!  Absolutely delicious!!  We chose the tasting menu with the wine pairing. They were 6 delicious courses, so glad we didn't eat lunch and that we were told not to eat the bread.  We would not have been able to finish if we had eaten the bread.  Jason and Elaina our wait staff, took very good care of us all night.  We did not want for anything during the meal.  It was a very very nice evening.

My favorite course was the short rib agnolotti, and my husband loved the scallop with foie gras and polenta.  The salted caramel sauce was so good I asked for a bowl to dip my cake in.  The dessert wine was a little weird for us but all of the other wine selections were perfect.  

We will be back for another big event, we enjoyed our evening that much.  Thank you Scarpetta for making this special evening so memorable."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with the meal here. For me personally, if I wanted a great Italian meal, I would rather stick with Buca. The food was OK it wasn't exceptional. It wasn't bad either. I had the halibut which was REALLY weird. It was like goopy and I thought \"how odd...\" I inquired thinking maybe this is how it was meant to come but they realized that there was something wrong with the fish, promptly apologized, owned up to the mistake, and when I asked for a different dish, they really rushed it and I wasn't left waiting for too long. 

Honestly, the best way any food mistake by a restaurant I've seen handled (the owning up to the mistake and rushing to get the second dish ready was probably the best / most perfect response to a situation like this. They did not comp or discount my dish though. Obviously didn't charge for the fish but the second dish I asked for to replace the fish showed up at full price on the bill- which is fine but thought I should mention that the extent of rectification was great communication and nothing more). 

Bottom line for me is, that the food was just ok and I've had better at several different placed in and around the vicinity. I went with a group of 8 and got to try a bit of everyone's dish- everything was just \"alright\" (we had venison, steak, pea soup, agnolotti, spaghetti, halibut, another fish dish etc, and several desserts)."}
{"text":"Had a bachelorette party here. Food was decent but the service sucks!! We had a large party so the gratitude was already included. However, I guess that was why they lost their motivation to make our visit comfortable."}
{"text":"In the mood for pasta. The whole family ordered it and the homemade variety did not disappoint . The duck fat ravioli was unique and a rare find in any Italian restaurant.  It was fantastic and didn't want the meal to end. Excellent service with real Italian waiters."}
{"text":"What a great night out.  There are several Italian choices in LV and I'm glad that we chose here.   The bread and especially Stromboli with eggplant was amazing, we asked for more.  The polenta with truffle was wow!   We had the short rib and spaghetti main courses and I would do it again. The broccoli was a little too bitter for me.  The wine menu is certainly one of the more inflated I have seen but we got a nice Groth for a little higher than going rate.  We couldn't get last minute reservations but could get a nice private booth in the lounge which was perfect and probably better than the main dining area. I would come back!"}
{"text":"Love love love!!!  

The food was delicious!   Right away we were sat under our 6 pm reservation and they gave us a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains. The waiter we had was very attentive and asked us if we had any allergies to any food! 

I ordered their cocktails while my husband had wine. They came pretty quickly and the water was even faster.  I ordered the 1/2 dozen oysters and scallops for our appetizers.  Excellent!  Wanted to order more.  For our entree, I ordered their short rib pasta and the husband had Filet Mignon.  My short ribs were probably a 6/10 but my husbands Filet Mignon I tried was really yummy.  

I really enjoyed the meal and the experience. The decor was amazing.  It also looked like they had what looked like romantic small tables near the front and if you had a larger group, there was a private room that could seat maybe 12-16 people  in the back of the restaurant or group seatings as well."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing - my two friends and I all had various pasta dishes and could not stop eating off one another's plates. However our service was HORRIBLE. Just because your clients are young does not mean you pay them any less attention (we are 23 each) because you think we are going to tip you less possibly? Also one our friends had gotten pick pocketed the night before. She had asked the waiter respectfully about alternative forms of ID that were understandably declined by the manager who then went on claiming how strict they were about IDing individuals.....but then did not even ID him when it came time for our one male friend (we were both females) to order a drink. Not sure if he meant to come off as sexist but I can promise you that it did - and quite rude in his mannerisms. However we took the high road and didn't pull the manager aside to complain about his waiting staff and instead gave our waiter a 40% tip. Promise you I won't be back until I've aged at least 10+ years because they simply don't enjoy young individuals."}
{"text":"Wow this restaurant is amazing. Atmosphere is chill with great music playing. Our waitir was so sweet and told great stories. My wine was fantastic and OMG the food is out of this world! Try the farmers salad, corn soup and the carrots! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I went with some friends to the 'Chef's Table' at Scarpetta last night. The food was outstanding -- we had the tuna carpaccio, special pastas, veal, steak....everything was superb. However, the sommelier was pretty much of a con artist. Because there is a dining minimum, he sold us a very expensive (think $450) bottle of a white Burgundy which had almost no flavor at all.  (When he asked, we said we were disappointed, and he gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne, to be fair.) But beware!!!!!  

We did have a lovely view of the Bellagio fountains and the kitchen."}
{"text":"Request a table by the windows for views of the Bellagio fountains.  We came here for a late dinner on a Thursday night.  We walked into a narrow room with no hostess to be found.  A little confused, we waited to see if we were in the right place. Along came a waiter to assist. He sat us by the windows. We got lucky.  We saw the amazing Bellagio fountain show every 15 minutes. It was pretty cool.  Dinner was good but pricey. I ordered 1/2 dozen of oysters to start and it was delis.  The homemade cocktail sauce was so perfect.  For my entree, I ordered the tagliatelle and it was okay. The first few bites were good but got heavy after a while, that and i'm not a fan of peas and carrots with my pasta.  My husband ordered the prime filet of beef with 
potato-lardo purée, rainbow chard & barolo sauce.  He loved it. The rainbow chard and barolo sauce was probably the best thing on the dish. We spent about $140 on dinner. i wasn't that impressed for the price but still good overall.   The view makes up for it. I'm a big fan of the Bellagio fountains and it never gets old."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences in Vegas to date.

To start off I must say that our waiter, Matt, was amazing.  He was so knowlegeable, friendly, and answered all of our questions.  He really knew the menu well and could give reccomendations with amazing detail.  I loved the staff here.

No joke, that bread basket with trio of citrus infused olive oil, eggplant spread and mascarpone butter...is to die for!  I could live off the stromboli filled with salami and smoked mozzarella.  So delicious.

As a starter, I tried the Raw Yellowtail.  The presentation was simple and clean with four thin slices of yellowtail topped with olio di zenzero, microgreens and sea salt.  It was so simple but you could taste the freshness.

For my next course, I ordered the Short Rib Agnolloti.  Perfection.  The brown butter and horseradish sauce was flavorful and had the right amount of kick to pull the dish together.  It was a very small portion but was perfect for a light dinner before going out.  My friends ordered the Spaghetti with Tomato and Basil, Black Tagliolini, and Orata Rossa.  They all enjoyed their meals and the experience at Scarpetta.

Our amazing waiter Matt, surprised our table with a birthday plate of an assortment of Italian cookies which were an amazing finish to a great meal.

Great ambiance, view of the Bellagio fountain, service, food...overall an amazing dinner!!"}
{"text":"This place will never let you down. Came with a group of 6 and we got access to the private room with a window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Our server Luis was a delight. At one point my husband dropped his steak knife and before he could even ask for a new one Luis had arrived with a new one. Seriously, amazing job.

I don't have to go on and on about the spaghetti again but seriously. Get it. You won't regret it.

My husband also got a filet that was one of the best cooked filets I've ever had. It was also served with this amazing swiss chard and onion that had this bright acidity that really balanced the steak well.

Crudos are tasty as well.

dessert we had the Bomboloni and the Budino. The budino was heaven in a jar. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner with friends to celebrate a birthday!   We were treated like royalty.  We sat at a table just off the kitchen with an incredible view of all the talent in the kitchen and a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  Mario (the GM) was so gracious.  Noe (the sommelier) was hysterical and kept us laughing all night long.  Thank you to everyone at Scarpetta that helped create incredible memories for our group of five."}
{"text":"Scarpetta is delicious! Great food and good, friendly service. I ordered their ubiquitous spaghetti, but I also got to try their daily special, pasta cooked with peaches and lobster, and their duck ravioli with foie gras. All dishes were excellent, but my favorite was the spaghetti with basil--simple and just different enough to distinguish itself as the best spaghetti I've had. 

The pasta and lobster special was light but the duck ravioili tasted rich, probably better shared, IMO."}
{"text":"We came here for our Anniversary and was really looking forward to what looked like an amazing dinner. The best part about our experience was the bread basket and dessert. Everything inbetween was a disappointment unfortunately. 

*The bread basket was amazing 

*The tuna and avocado appetizer was so bland. The waiter told us guests had complained of too much citrus added to the dish so they took it away. WTF 
So now Im paying almost $20 for a piece of tuna with sinew running through all of our pieces and plain avocado. It was a slight joke. Im sure it was better with the citrus dressing they got rid of. 

*The spaghetti was good I ate all of it but I added the meatballs which were also a joke. They were so tiny and tasted like baby food. 

*The short Rib ravioli dish was good

*The mascarpone cheesecake was heaven. 

*The service was great, almost a little too attentive like they were trying to rush us through the meal for table turn over. 

*All in all it was ok. The view of the Bellagio fountains was a bonus. I felt like I was paying more for the view than the food. I love Scott Conant, I love Chopped, there are so many restaurants to choose from in Vegas and I was reaaally looking forward to going there but I was a bit let down. If we were to return to Scarpetta it would be for a cocktail and dessert."}
{"text":"The hours posted are very wrong. I made a reservation for 5:30 on a Thursday, apparently they don't open until 6. I asked the girl standing inside about why they weren't open when I arrived at 5:30 and she was extremely rude. The concierge at The Cosmopolitan had told us they open at 5:30, their website says 5:30, this yelp page says 5:30. The girl I interacted with was short in tone, condescending, slammed the door on us and in no way helpful or apologetic. Since we had a show to get to at 7, we didn't stay and wait for them to let us in at 6. She wasn't just rude to me, she was rude to an entire family waiting as well.

I was really looking forward to finally trying this place. I come to Vegas often and I can say I won't ever give this place a try again. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't think you can go wrong with ANY restaurant in Cosmo. I've been to 3 so far and each one has been phenomenal. My friends and I decided to give Scarpetta a try since it's Restaurant Week! 

Scarpetta is an Italian restaurant that is located on the 3rd level of Cosmo. It overlooks the Bellagio fountains which makes it great date spot. It's also pretty dark and romantical in there too. If you're coming here for a date, definitely ask for window seats. 

Onto the food!

Appetizers:
     - Braised short rib with vegetable and farro risotto: this was delicious! The short rib is sliced (instead of the chunky ones I'm used to seeing) and the risotto was super creamy
     - Creamy polenta with truffle mushrooms: this was a amazing! I love anything with truffle and if I didn't know may better, I would've thought the polenta was mashed potatoes because it was so creamy!

Entrees: 
     - Prime filet of beef with Swiss chard and barolo: I got this medium well and I absolutely loved it. The steak was juicy and paired well with the swiss chard 
     - Spaghetti with tomato and basil: cooked al dente, sauce was perfect. However, this wouldn't be something I'd get again mainly because I need some sort of meat in my meals

Dessert:
     - Nutella bombolini: Fried dough rolled in sugar. Reminded me of Chinese fried donuts but with Nutella inside. This was good but wasn't my favorite. 
     - Amedei chocolate cake: definitely hits the chocolate spot. It's more of a dark chocolate cake which is my kind of jam!
     - Mascarpone cheesecake: my favorite! It was so smooth and not overly sweet. I ate the whole thing! 

Since it's Restaurant Week, this 3-course meal was $50 which is totally worth it in my opinion. Just go with someone so you can share multiple things on the menu :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were staying at the cosmo over the Christmas break and we decided we wanted some good Italian food. And we got it
We got;
Side of wild mushrooms
Grilled octopus 
Wild boar spaghetti 
Basil and tomato spaghetti

Everything was perfect and excellent, their staff was very friendly and attentive. 

They will not seat you earlier than your dinner reservation, so don't go too early. Their lounge/bar area is comfortable to eat at."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Scarpetta several times and while we have enjoyed it each time, it's not the best value - the portions are small and kinda fussy. 

The view is great and the service is always good. But if you are near the window, either you are looking over someone or they are looking over you, it's not comfortable."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend so we went with another couple that was with us in Vegas. We had so many dishes I can't even remember it all (or all the fancy names) but it was amazing! I had the pasta with clams & my husband had their spaghetti. Both excellent! I am SUPER picky about my pasta being over cooked but this place was on POINT! I had the raw tuna appetizer which was just heavenly! We also had the polenta with mushrooms which was delicious!!! I don't even like mushrooms but this was soooo good! 
Desserts were the highlight of this dinner! My good friend is a BIG DESSERTS girl so when our table was covered in desserts she about died. We had 5 different desserts the 4 of us shared and every single one was thoroughly enjoyed! Yum! My husband and my friend said the cheesecake and the souffle were by far the best they ever had! Personally I LOVED the homemade soda/fruit dessert that came out! It was so different and SO YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Dinner reservations at 9:30pm on Sunday. Food was decent but nothing wow. Service was a little off and made the experience a little sour. Ordered Mediterranean octopus, duck and foie gras ravioli, black tagliolini, spaghetti, fennel dusted black cod, broccoli rabe, and strawberry soufflé. The stand outs were the octopus and ravioli. Everything else fell flat. Our spaghetti came out crunchy; well under done. Sent it back to get it cooked a little longer and it still came out not cooked through. I question if the pasta is made in house. The soufflé was undercooked as well. They sent a plate of bite sized desserts to make up for it but I was over it by that point. Took forever and a day to close the bill. A little weird when the restaurant was empty but, whatever. A plus was the view of the bellagio fountain and plate presentation."}
{"text":"My partner took me here for my 22nd birthday. It was one hell of a treat. 
He was able to get us a chair near the windows with a great view of the Bellagio Fountains. The lighting was dim, but not too dark and surprisingly quiet and romantic. 
He ended up purchasing (not sure what the hell it's called) this sort of sampling type thing...expensive, but we had about 8 courses of food or so. By the time we got to the dessert, I was stuffed. The food was amazing. The service was spectacular. The place looked nice, but expect to spend a little money for this amazing place."}
{"text":"Food was good, not great. Service severely lacking, at least at our table. Portions not comparable with the prices but could have been overlooked had our waiter been more professional and customer service oriented. 

Management really should choose their employees more carefully, and that would include front of the house.

As for the window seating....where to begin. It really needs to be stated that even though there is window seating with view of the strip, there is a very large horizontal beam (which happens to be at eye level when seated) that obstructs your view. Restaurant should have made design considerations with regard to seating and tables to accommodate for that beam. 

Better places -hands down- in Vegas to spend a little less of my hard earned money and receive a better meal and better service!"}
{"text":"I visited Scarpetta quite a while ago, but the experience was a negative one and therefore I feel the need to share, for the sake of diners who are looking to spend some money on a nice dinner.  I'm giving Scarpetta one star for the bread. It was the only remarkable part of the meal. Service was alright... A bit on the snooty side despite the fact that we ordered the most expensive things in the menu and lots of wine.
The most disappointing moment if the evening was when I ordered the truffled egg noodles, which were supposed to be dressed with shaved truffle at the table. I don't know what our waiter grated on my pasta, but nothing about my meal tasted like truffle. It was nothing more than buttered noodles. The price for this pasta dish was an offensive $60. No matter how passable anything else was (the diver scallops were nothing special), I could never justify being robbed blind for such a sad and disappointing main course. 
Perhaps judging a place by one dish is unfair, but truffles and pasta are special to me. A place that charges this much for Italian food should be doing it above and beyond."}
{"text":"Came here for a girl's weekend out. What a great experience! 
Scarpetta is located on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. It's quite swanky, so you will want to dress up so you don't stick out like a sore thumb. The ambience is classy /sophisticated. The lighting is a bit dark, but that's why this is a great set up for looking out the window at night to see the Bellagio water show. It's a great place to take a date or to just have a \"let's get dressed up cuz we can\" night out with the girls.
We had a reservation, so we were seated immediately. May I just mention that the service here is magnificent. There was just the three of us, but they still sat us in a huge booth that can easily sit 6 people. It's a circular booth, so I was a little apprehensive about scooting with my little black dress on. Without saying a word, our host slid the whole table out, so that we can walk to our seats instead of scooting. From then, they had already won me over =).
 Ok, let's get to the food shall we? We started with the \"Braised short ribs of beef\" which is placed over root vegetables and risotto. Delish. The short rib was soft and delicate and melt in your mouth deliciousness. Not over seasoned at all. There are four small pieces, but each bite is delightful. The other appetizer that we decided to share was the \"Roasted Sea Scallops\" which is served over cauliflower, bottarge, cili and caper sauce. Aaaaaaaaaa-mazing. If I wasn't so nice, I would've eaten both pieces instead of share it. ;-)
The complimentary bread came with three spreads - butter, eggplant, and olive oil. All three tasted great and the different types of bread were warm and soft and all kinds of good =P. And since I love bread... this just won me over even more.
So since this is an Italian restaurant and the chef became famous because of his spaghetti, we all decided to order pasta. We ordered \"Duck and foie gras ravioli\", \"spaghetti,\" and \"stracci\"... all of which were heavenly. The ravioli was soft, but not mushy and filled with such great flavor that my friend, who was already really full midway, ate the whole entire dish. Spaghetti - you think it's just regular good ol' spaghetti... not at all. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was on point. Not too salty, not too sweet. perfect. My dish was the Stracci - flat pieces of hand made noodles with lobster, crab, shrimp, and basil breadcrumbs. If you're mouth has not watered just reading that - something is seriously wrong with you. This is probably my most favorite pasta dish. They did not skimp on the blue crabs (I at least believe it's blue crabs, though, I can't be entirely sure), the lobster mean, and the shrimp. I wanted to save room for dessert, but I just couldn't stop stuffing myself with this dish. I loved that the flat noodles didn't stick to each other and it was soft and just really well made. I loved loved loved it!
I wish I could tell you we ordered dessert. But the three of us were just so full that we decided to opt out of the dessert. Though all of them sounded amazing.
In any case, I rarely give out 5's. For me, something has to stick out. In this case, though the food was extraordinary, the service and the view puts it over my usual 4 stars into  a 5 star yelp review.
Bottom line: I would definitely come here again.. so there's not reason why you shouldn't try it out =)"}
{"text":"delicious food, the view was beautiful, the fountains at the Bellagio, classy ambience, good for couples, or group of friends, it is very nice, the food, starting with the bread omg it's soooo goood, we tried the pici pasta, duck raviolis, fennel spiced black cob, mediterranean orata and the prime ny steak... everything was sooo delicious, the service was perfect, the waiter was very nice... the price is standar for vegas for a nice restaurant... I want to go back... for sure!!"}
{"text":"I went here on a very specific mission: duck & foie gras ravioli. I barely even glanced at the menu - all I needed was confirmation that the ravioli was still there. And while it took awhile to get to the point where I got to finally eat the ravioli, it did not disappoint (an oh-so-divine 5 stars).

When we arrived, we were promptly seated. However, we were actually seated more in the bar area than the actual restaurant area (which appeared to have a decent view). Where we were seated was ok, though. It was a curved booth that had a very private feel to it. But it was near impossible to take in and experience the ambiance where seated.

Our server was nice and knowledgeable. I stated what I planned on eating and he was able to recommend a glass of wine to pair with it. However, when our food arrived, there was no ravioli. I had been delivered some other duck dish instead. Having to send it back and sit there while the others I was with completely finished their meals was quite awkward. And while the server who actually delivered the food apologized, our main server, who took our order, said nothing. 

The whole mix-up experience seemed very un-Vegas. No apologies, no \"dessert is on us\", no nothing. I honestly felt treated like I was the one who screwed up (despite being very clear on what I wanted - and it was my sole purpose in dining here - and having witnesses who can vouch to what I ordered).

So despite the ravioli being a home run, I have to deduct stars for the rest of the experience. 

But OMG the ravioli is beyond fantastic. I literally sat there and considered ordering a 2nd helping. Move over Mario Batali - your beef cheek ravioli now has some serious competition. In fact, the duck & foie gras ravioli at Scarpetta may actually be better than B&B's beef cheek ravioli. I'm going to have to that 2nd helping in order to confirm, but I may indeed have a new favorite Vegas dish.

So yeah, fab food, but not-so-hot first dining experience."}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant in The Cosmopolitan.  Cocktails, food and desserts... stellar.  Ask for a table by the window."}
{"text":"We visited here during a recent weekend to celebrate my brother's 30th birthday.  As we had planned poorly and did not make reservations, it was excellent that this restaurant had a high table available in the bar area for immediate seating.

Drinks - most of us went with Old Fashioned (various bourbons) and service was prompt and correct every time.

Food - most of us ate pretty light as it was our first night in Vegas, but there were a few notable items:
1.  The bread selection was amazing!  The different selections and butter/oil to pair was great.
2.  The duck fois gras was amazing!  Great taste while not overpowering everything else.   

Our experience was great, but the billing (covering for my brother on his birthday) caused quite the confusion when billing everything out.  The receipts almost needed an accounting expert to discern, but everything ended up correct in the end.  Overall 4 stars with a NEAR higher rating.  I had seen that some were able to get a tour of the kitchen, but it did not appear this was in the cards for us tonight!  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"I expected to be blown away by the food but I wasn't.  I tried the corn soup, and while I loved the smoked mozzarella pieces in it, the soup itself was a bit too sweet for me. I also tasted the pork chop with apple mostarda, which was tasty, but again I felt it lacked salt. The bread service was exceptional - breads stuffed with different things like salami and broccoli rabe, served with sides like citrus olive oil and caponata. Service was excellent. Based on the meal, I most likely won't return, which sort of saddens me because I really was hoping for a more exciting food experience."}
{"text":"This place was just awesome all around. Food was top shelf and classy. View of strip/Bellagio Fountain were awesome. If you don't mind spending a little extra this is a great date night place."}
{"text":"THE DRILL-

Come early and enjoy the incredible mixology. Each and every cocktail is unique and memorable. Pick your poison or venture out, either way you won't be disappointed. 

As for the food, be prepared for a sudden indecisiveness to overcome you. It's not easy to narrow it down by any means. As for us, I ordered the Black Cod while my husband opted for the Duck. We also ordered the Spaghetti to split since it was noted in many of the reviews. We both absolutely loved our mains and definitely had a low key food fight of sorts over the spaghetti. Definitely more than enough food, but not so much that you regret ordering one extra main to split. Do not skip the spaghetti, I guarantee you will regret it. If not for the way it is served (under the dome) but definitely for the simplicity, yet amazing flavor.

As for the finale or dessert, we opted for the Amedei Chocolate Cake. Completely phenomenal and a rich brownie, fudge-like indulgence. Remarkably not nearly as rich and heavy as you would think, which ultimately made it the perfect finish to our meal. 

Scarpetta, we will be back. (Probably not soon enough in our books)."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant with amazing food.  We stayed at the Cosmo and the concierge was kind to make reservations for us.

We had a great time!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the Cosmo, this restaurant is intimate and has a great view of the Bellagio fountain. I made reservations through Opentable and it worked just fine. We even arrived a bit early but they had our table ready and were able to seat us right away. We had an awesome seat by the window across from the fountain and basically had dinner and a show. It was perfect. Service was good, water was constantly filled, plates taken away and made sure we were doing okay. Food was so-so... yes, I said it... it was just okay. I had the duck and foie gras ravioli and the bf had the short rib agnolotti. I actually enjoyed his dish more than my own.. but both pastas were only okay. Somewhat lacked flavor, or I just might be more of a tomato sauce kind of girl. I did however enjoy their assortment of bread and the butter, and other dipping sauces they had. That was delicious and we had to have two servings of that. We also had a Caesar salad which was delicious and had a hint of lemon flavor that was refreshing."}
{"text":"Highlights of our truly amazing meal at Scarpetta include some of the best handmade pasta dishes I have ever had. While the more complex agnolotti were delicious and certainly worth a repeat order, the best of all were the simplest: spaghetti with tomato and basil; pici with lobster. 

Appetizers and meat courses were also terrific, but secondary to the pasta. The one notable exception was a rib cap (cap of the rib eye), which I have never seen on a menu. It was tender, perfectly cooked, and literally bursting with a rich, fatty, beefy flavor. 

Service was top notch, though we were in a private room with dedicated wait staff. The bar, though narrow, offered a fine selection of liquors with bartenders who know how to make a decent cocktail. For an aperetif, I strongly recommend the Aperol Spritz."}
{"text":"No comparison to NYC or Miami locations. 
My favorite dish - that I was SO looking forward to in no way compared to the same dish in NYC. (Beef short rib pasta )
All pastas were served more than al dente. 
Would not dine  at this location again."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided that we wanted to try Scott Conant's Scarpetta; what a great decision. The atmosphere and view from our table was excellent for a romantic dinner. We were wowed by the wine selection, albeit pricey, and the initial offering of bread and accoutrements laid the groundwork for an amazing dinner. First course consisted of the braised short rib risotto which was so incredibly tender and rich. I also ordered the beef tartare and quail egg which was top notch but came with no surprises. My wife went with the famous spaghetti for her entree and let me tell you, it blows the doors off Gordon Ramsey's beef Wellington (and it's only a few simple ingredients and fresh pasta!). I ordered the lamb with grain mustard and kale which was expertly cooked and delicious. For dessert we had the chocolate cake and the watermelon parfait. I'm not a fruit dessert kind of guy so the parfait didn't appeal to me much but my wife loved it. It did seem rather refreshing. My chocolate cake was insanely rich and delicious but made me wish I had a glass of milk to go with it, haha. All things considered it was my favorite dinner during our trip to Vegas (among visits to Gordon Ramsey's 'Steak', Wolfgang Puck's 'Spago' and a handful of buffets). We will absolutely be going back. Love you Scott Conant!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  I felt that my Branzino was just okay I didn't like the bland broth they poured on it. My sister whose birthday we were celebrating took one bite of the duck foie gras ravioli and pushed the plate away did not like the brown sauce on top. A good thing we also ordered an uni truffle pasta so she ate that instead.  Beef carpaccio appetizer  was good.  Ordered the mushrooms for my side and it was super salty.  After a couple bites I've had enough. 

A lot of leftovers.  Would I come back? Yes, but will try something else the only thing I would order again though is the beef carpaccio."}
{"text":"Had a later reservation, 9pm, expected a larger crowd but the restaurant wasn't that busy. We were seated in the larger dining room with an excellent view of the Bellagio fountains show - did not realize the fountains could shoot that high into the air?!?! Wow!

Ambiance was nice, relaxed, easy. Selection  on the menu was great, something for just about everyone. Wait staff gave us 5 star service. Value was a 3 because although the meal was decent, we had read so many excellent reviews and this restaurant came highly recommended by peers from work, yet the food didn't blow us away. We ate recently in Napa at Bottega and paid the same amount ~ $125 for the meal and neither of us could stop talking about that meal. At Scarpetta, the $125 was expensive for the food. We shared the Burrata salad, which was delicious. - I recommend it. I had the turkey dinner special (a Thanksgiving special item) it was good, but the taste was average. She had the lamb and we thought the turkey was better. No dessert. 

Wine selection was excellent. I'd recommend the restaurant but wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again."}
{"text":"Simply said (weird for me) this is the best pasta I've ever had. Tomatoes and basil. That's it.

Order that. 

And wine. Ok, and short ribs. 

The bread is fantastic.  He's a genius! 

Wow."}
{"text":"The best part of the meal was the bread basket, it was seriously the best bread I've ever had. We had the polenta and short rib appetizers and both were amazing. The short rib and bone morrow agnolotti with a brown butter sauce was excellent as was the duck breast. The pici noodles were perfect and perfectly spiced. The flavors were wonderful. The prime filet of beef was ok. We were all stuffed but we had to have the bomboloni and chocolate cake, yum!"}
{"text":"I generally do not write reviews but our experience this past weekend requires that I warn others before you drop serious $$ for dinner. Net: Good service, nice ambiance, marginal food, outrageous cost. I've had fine dinners all over the world and this would rate on the bottom in terms of taste, portion, and quality. It would also rank as one of the most expensive. I ordered prime tartare--it was (no joke) 1 inch in diameter and virtually no taste. It cost $22! Our other guest ordered spaghetti and it was very average. There isn't a single bottle of wine under $100. This place is a complete rip off (we dropped $450 for four people) and not worth your hard-earned money. You can get better tasting food, better portions, and a fair price somewhere else. Stay away unless you prefer to throw your money away."}
{"text":"Short rib agnolotti wins for the best pasta. And the spaghetti a close second. Shared those and the duck foie gras ravioli with my husband and we were very happily stuffed. Three pastas is kind of overkill (especially with the bread! The BREAADDDDD) so next time I'd get a vegetable instead of a third pasta. But overall, an excellent dining experience in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Friday night in Vegas.  I've seen Scott Conant on Chopped a hundred times and he always comes across as a little too full of himself, claiming to be the master of pasta.   With this in mind I was actually looking forward to criticizing his restaurant, but I just can't.  

I ordered the creamy polenta appetizer and shared it with the table.  It was amazing, with the truffled mushrooms blending perfectly with the polenta whose \"creamy\" descriptor in the menu is both descriptive and right on.

I then ordered the duck and foie gras ravioli.  I thought it would be too rich, but the portion was just right and somehow, despite it being duck with foie gras, was not too rich.  The pasta was cooked perfectly... damn you Conant.  

For dessert we had the Bombolini and the Strawberry Souffle, both were great, with the Bombolini being the favorite for the table.  

The dinner was absolutely lovely and everything was very flavorful, in perfect portions and made just right."}
{"text":"The ambiance is perfect for a small group or a romantic date.  We came here to meet up with some good friends.   We sat at a quiet candle lit table.

The food was good and served promptly.  The only issue that I have is that our server suggested that we order several dishes per person to share.  I felt that he was pushy and was trying to upsell.  I had the pici, and that was plenty for me.  Had we followed his suggestion, we would have had a lot of leftover food.  

I do recommend that you try out their specialty drinks.  Those were superb.

Overall, Scarpetta is about a 3.5."}
{"text":"Originally went to the location in Miami at the Fountainbleu and was so impressed and ecstatic to find out there was one in Vegas at the Cosmo! 

Best spaghetti I've ever tasted (as always). My girlfriend ordered the truffle pasta and it was pricey, but very much worth the $65! 

The wine enthusiast was very nice and made the dinner even more enjoyable by offering us complimentary wine tasting. 

Truly one of a kind in fine Italian dining! Would recommend to everyone who enjoys delicious eats, hospitality, and great service!"}
{"text":"Scarpetta is a definite must go! The ambiance is warm and inviting. Everything from the short rib appetizer to the signature spaghetti with tomato and basil was prepared perfectly. I can't say enough good things about this amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow...yummy!

I had wanted to try out Scarpetta having been a huge Chopped fan and knowing I was going to be staying next-door in the Bellagio. OpenTable didn't have a reservation available for that day and I thought I was out of luck. We happen to be at the Cosmopolitan anyways and went upstairs to do a drop in... luckily they had a table for two with a Fountain view and all!

I can't say enough good things about the breadbasket it was amazing. The caponata I could've eaten 10 bowls. 

But I wisely left some room for apps and the main. I had the beet and burrata salad. The dressing on the beets was tangy and the burrata very rich and smooth. It was also beautifully composed. My companion had the polenta. Which was just as sinfully creamy as they said it would be.

For main I had the bone marrow agnolotti. Rich little pillows of beefy heaven. And the breadcrumb crunch on top...perfect. And of course we had to try the famous spaghetti. There's a reason they're famous for it. Sauce clings to the noodles and transports you to Italy...get it."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about eating here after the not-so-hot reviews in Toronto Life, and pretty much everywhere else, but I was pleasantly surprised.
The food was great.  I know it sounds crazy, but the bread basket was a standout - fresh spreads (marscapone butter, oil and garlic, and egglant), combined with 4-5 different types of bread.  Delicious.  
I started with the creamy polenta, which was completely delicious, and a good size for $15.  
For the mains we had the spaghetti, which was delicious and decievingly filling for the size.  I also ordered the Agnolotti, filled with a cheese and meat stuffing.  Also delicious.
Finally the dessert: A chocolate cake which might even surpass the awesomeness of the Terroni Chocolate cake.  Believe it.   So dense, almost liquid on the inside, it was perfectly paired with a small scoop of gelato.  Amazing.
Service was impeccable - much better than perhaps the earlier experiences of some of the reviewers.  It seems that Scarpetta just needed to get in its groove and hire people that are not only pretty faces, but who also excel at customer service.
Altogether a great spot for a nice meal!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and view of the Bellagio fountain was amazing. However the food did not live up to the reviews on here. Granted people raved about the spaghetti - which I did not get. Why? Because I couldn't justify spending $24 on pasta with marinara sauce. Throw in a meatball or two and you would have had me sold. But my boyfriend makes some damn good spaghetti at home and it's free. So I decided to pass on that. Instead I went for the lobster with squid-ink farfalle (I think it was around $35) and was NOT impressed. The pasta was too undercooked and was almost chewy. Furthermore, it had garlic, tomatoes, and basil breadcrumbs. Sounds good right? For some reason it tasted horrible. I pushed most of it to the side and ate all the lobster.

My boyfriend had their bone-in ribeye special ($56) which was HUGE! Although the meat tasted like buttery goodness, he literally sliced almost half of it off because it was nothing but fat. And I'm not kidding - I'm talking a good half of his steak. After cutting all the fat off as well as separating the meat from the bone, we realized we should have ordered something else because there was almost nothing left. However, I will give the place props for some delicious horseradish scalloped potatoes. They were so good! 

All in all, I thought for the price we paid, the food was way under par. I probably wouldn't go back to be honest. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Meh. Overpriced restaurant that was both hit and miss. For apps we had the polenta (good for polenta, decent otherwise), diver scallops (I've had better and it's hard to mess up naturally sweet scallops at a half decent restaurant), and a pile of over fried tower of seafood and various veg (awful. Bland. The shrimp and calamari were sad little lumps and shreds. Can't believe the waitress recommended it). My main of duck & fois gras saved this from being a two star review as the dish was truly unique, rich and tasty.

While the atmosphere is classy, the ambient noise and the acoustics from the high ceilings make it difficult to have a conversation."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant, mainly for its classy atmosphere and truffles!  I found the pizza I had a bit bland but the other food was really interesting and tasty."}
{"text":"I tried the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli which had a very rich taste. Service was not up to par. When the manager stepped in to serve our table it was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to to get in with short notice and everyone was very nice.  From the host to the bartender and throughout the whole evening everyone was extremely nice and helpful.  

The food was also great.  Even with high expectations going in we left knowing that we had a new favorite spot.  The breads were great the meal was exceptional and the deserts were also spot on.  

We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"It is very rare we brave The Strip. We went to celebrate so many years of being in love. They sat us by the window, which had a beautiful view of the Bellagio Fountains. The Twenty Bench Cab was delicious, and the Espresso Old Fashioned was spectacular. We ordered the Duck Foi Gras Ravioli, Short Rib Marrow Agnolotti, Creamy Polenta with Mushroom Ragu, and the Branzino. I feel like what I described is the food of the lower class 100 years ago. But sometimes, good, comfortable ingredients, prepared perfectly, and served by Roberto, who had a great personality and style, well... it is worth it. Thank you Scarpetta for making our night memorable and delicious!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite meals in Vegas! 

Pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. Even the plain old spaghetti was divine. It was actually my favorite noodle dish here, since the simple sauce helped me appreciate the perfectly cooked noodles even more. 

The mushroom truffle risotto special was so savory and so balanced (truffle can sometimes be overpowering) and I have to say, it outdid my favorite mushroom risotto with scallops from Cafe Hiro (located in Orange County, CA). Scarpetta, you ruined me forever! Makes me almost regret coming here. 

Food came out exceptionally quickly (even to the point of suspicion: Do they make it in batches? Do they anticipate order and make them beforehand? Who knows? Restaurant secrets). This was very much appreciated since we had to make a 9:30 show.

The wine expert was also very helpful with our wine selection. Just name some tastes you like and a price range and voila! Don't remember the name of the bottle we got but it was enjoyed all around.

Dishes to order: Mushroom risotto, spaghetti, diver scallops, market salad

Dishes to skip: Pici (not very memorable and at $38, big disappointment)"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a table by the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains, which was lovely. The restaurant itself is very nicely decorated and feels warm and intimate. The background music was kind of random as it felt like Frank Sinatra or some jazz music should have been playing.

I am going to start with the food because that is whats really important, isn't it?? The breads are a lovely way to begin the meal especially because they offer a variety of dips and breads. The citrus infused olive oil was divine as was the extra soft butter. The salami and cheese stuffed bread looked amazing but I don't eat meat so my husband was able to eat 2 pieces to himself. He said it tasted as good as it looked. 

The menu is small but offers some great choices. We started with the beet salad and a root vegetable soup. Both were excellent and the presentations were beautiful. For our main courses, we had the lobster pasta dish and the cheese agnolotti with a truffle butter sauce. I loved the agnolotti - it was a simple dish that didn't have to try to be anything else. Butter + truffles = love. My husbands dish had generous chunks of lobster, a delicious sauce, and perfectly prepared handmade pasta. We were in foodie heaven with every bite. We were sorry we didn't get dessert but we were so full so only ordered coffee. 

If this review was for food alone, I would give it 5 stars but here are some of the reasons why I wont give this restaurant a 5 star review: 

The service was only OK.  It wasn't over the top as one would expect from this type of establishment. Our waiter was pleasant but did not  go over anything on the menu. I am sure other diners had a better experience b/c we heard him talking away with the table next to us. It was strange b/c he did not offer one recommendation to us nor did he talk about any of the dishes or how they were prepared. 

The didn't \"sweep\" the table between dishes. Normally things like this don't bother me but we had bread crumbs on the table and when you are eating at an expensive restaurant you are paying for food and overall dining experience.  Which brings me to one more gripe, they didn't offer any extras like other expensive restaurants typically do. There was no Amuse Bouche (yes this is a French thing) but places like Tom Colicchio's Craft gives you a tasting to start with in addition to your breads. 

Overall: I would like to give this place 4 stars b/c the food was excellent but for the price and reputation, I was expecting a better dining experience. I am wondering if the Beverly Hills Scarpetta would be better?"}
{"text":"I had dinner 2 nights here during a recent tradeshow.  Both nights the service was unbearably slow, the food mediocre (w/ the one exception of the spaghetti pomodoro which was outstanding) and I would not opt to go back with so many other great dining options in the area.  The ambiance is very nice, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars rather than 2 - so if you're not too concerned about the quality of the food and want a nice, quiet restaurant for a work dinner this wouldn't be such a bad option."}
{"text":"The diners: 9 ladies celebrating a bachelorette weekend. 
Reservation time: 7:30p Sat night.  We were late about 15 min. but we called ahead to let them know and they were cool about it. 
Some things we ordered:
-Calamari: thinly cut and deliciously flaky and salty.
-Yellowtail Appetizer: nicely flavored but oh-so not enough!  5 thin pieces
-Scallops: meh but then again I'm not a fan of scallops
-Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli:  extremely rich, definitely get as appetizer and not an entree
-Black Farfalle: the presentation didn't look that appealing cuz it is literally a dish of black pasta, but taste-wise it was pretty good; small but sufficient amounts of maine lobster
-Halibut: on the drier side
-Stracchi: interestingly small squares of flat pasta
-Desserts: Napoleon was popular with the group, Zeppole was so-so, Chocolate Cake was really rich but imo yummiest of all the desserts, and lastly....the Cheesecake....BLECH!

Description of the Cheesecake dessert on the menu...\"Cheesecake.  Mango Granita, Pistachio Brittle\".  When you order cheesecake, you expect to get a sweet creamy cake made from cream cheese, right?  Not here!  It's GOAT CHEESE people!  So if you like goat cheese cheesecake you'll love the cheesecake at Scarpetta.  Most of the food was actually pretty good (4 stars worth) but because the stupid bald older waiter of ours failed to tell 2 of us who ordered the cheesecake that it is made from goat cheese, AND THEN proceeded to argue w/ me saying that \"goat cheese\" was written on the menu...uh NO it was not, can you read English?!...that took it down a notch for me.  Not sure I'd go back myself.  If I do, I'll make sure not to have that guy wait on me again."}
{"text":"The resteraunt was awesome. The atmosphere was nice. Very trendy, dark, romantic and upscale. Perfect for dates. The service was quick because the staff is very attentive and polite. Ofcourse it being in Vegas, the prices were high but the entree I got (chicken.. cant remember the exact name) wasn't great for the price I paid but definitely heavy. My friend got pasta and it was absolutely amazing so maybe it was just my entree i didn't love. I would still recommend going there."}
{"text":"Full disclosure- one of the employees treated me to dinner here, so I was able to sample more dishes than I might normally. And I must say, I am SO glad that I did! This may rate as one of the best meals I've had in 2015.

Scarpetta is a beautiful, dimly lit restaurant in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. We opted to dine in the lounge, so I wasn't able to see much of the decor, but from what I did see, it was comfortable and elegant.

Service was top notch. All of the servers were knowledgable and friendly, and the presentation was lovely.

Of course, I cannot remember the official names of all of the dishes, so I will just touch on some of the highlights. 

The octopus appetizer- delicious. Warm, tender, not too chewy, served with olives and tomatoes. 

The scallops- one of my favorite seafoods, and it was definitely done justice. The little pieces of meat in the dish were an awesome surprise, and the scallops were cooked perfectly. They were served over white beans, which were a bit unnecessary, but still a fantastic dish.

We had a side of spaghetti, which was cooked to perfection. Easily the best pasta I've had- simple and delicious.

The cod- melted in my mouth. Just amazing. 

And the cheesecake for dessert, served with a Greek yogurt gelato, granola, and blueberries. Words can't even describe how fantastic this was. I loved every single bite.

Of course, a meal this good comes with a rather significant price tag, but it is worth the cost. I hope I have the opportunity to return!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with a great view of the strip. From where we were sitting, we can see the Bellagio water show. Romantic kind of feels. It's located on the 3rd floor where many of the other restaurants are, near the Boulevard elevators. My friends and I came for restaurant week to try their dinner pre fixe menu. My selections were:

Creamy polenta- this was my favorite! They topped it off with some truffle mushrooms. It has a little bit of a kick, very creamy, smooth, and delish.
Spaghetti- noodles were perfect aldente with just the right amount of sauce. 
Nutella bomboloni- sugar coated doughnuts with nutella inside. It was pretty basic. 
Lets not forget about the bread basket! Your table will get a variety of breads as well as mascapone butter, lemon olive oil, and an eggplant spread. The breads alone got me full! I think there were 4 types. The ones I can remember were.... rosemary bread, sourdough, and the salami and cheese. 

I was very impressed with the service. They have a great system of distinguishing each persons order. For each course, a different server brought out the dishes, and they knew what dish to place in front of you without asking who ordered what. Our main 2 waiters made sure our waters were always filled and cleaned away the used dishes/utelsils promptly."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review to 4 stars after my most recent visit. I was excited to bring my mom to my favorite restaurant in Vegas, but our experience was a little disappointing. I still rate (most of) the food 5 stars, but the service wasn't as great as the 4 other times I dined here. It was, in fact, quite poor service. Waiting 20min from the time you finish your main entree to receive a dessert menu from someone that wasn't even our server, was frustrating. He was just never around the entire time we were there. 

I also recommend NOT getting the vanilla lemon cake for dessert. It was dry and flavorless. There was more sorbet than cake, and the sorbet was bitter and sour. 

As always, the black tagliolini was to-die for."}
{"text":"I went here for a business dinner and I was very impressed by the decor, service, food, and wine. I was really excited to come here for dinner after watching Scott Conant on the Food Network.

We were a bit early for our reservation, so we sat in the bar beforehand. The service and ambiance were great. Interesting enough, we had potato chips to munch on with our drinks.

Once we were sat for dinner, the ambiance carried into the restuarant. I had creamy polenta to start. I finished a lllllllll of it. For my entree, I had lamb. It was fantastic. I also had a bite of the duck and foie gras ravioli. It was quite tasty.

The evening was complete with a couple (maybe a few???) bottles of Il Borro Toscano and Badia a Passignano Chianti."}
{"text":"Being from Nyc I've been wanting to go and try Scarpetta after hearing many great reviews about it. I was heading to Vegas in a few days and realized that Scarpetta was also in the Cosmopolitan, so I decided to make reservations for the group of 8 that I was with. (Walking through the Cosmo later that day I noticed Chef Scott Conant who is the owner walking into the restaurant which is nice to see the care for his restaurant)  So after arriving a few minutes earlier than the rest of my party, I decided to check in with the host. After talking for a minute he mentioned to me that they had the Chef's table available if interested, to which I responded YES! As we walked through the dining room passing many full table we entered a private room with floor to ceiling glass with a few of the kitchen and the other wall was the same but with a few of the Bellagio fountains which was beautiful.  Soon after the waiter and sommelier (Noel) entered to find out which wine that we would like for the evening. I didn't deal the \"wine man\" but did enjoy a nice Cabernet with my dinner. Good choice sir. Waiter placed some delicious bread (even from being from NY) along with a mascarpone butter, citrus infused olive oil, and eggplant caponata. All were excellent. On to the primi piatti, we ordered a few for the table including the tuna susci, Mediterranean octopus, braised short ribs, and polenta. All were fixed to perfection, the octopus stood out to me because it's a very delicate item and easily under or over cooked. The short ribs had a hard time staying on the bone. Tuna was cubed and paired with avocado, close to a perfect bite. I will only speak for myself when it comes to my entree which was the famous Spaghetti with tomato and basil (unfair to call it a sauce when it's so much better than just a sauce.) Living in nyc all my life where pasta is \"supposed\" to be the best I'm very picky because most Italian restaurants don't put any care into the dish. QUITE the OPPOSITE, on the record going to say probably best pasta dish I've ever had. Seasoned fantastically, silky/savoy tomato/basil, pasta was cooked perfectly. $24 dollars seems like a lot but if you taste how good it is...you'll probably think it's one of the best deals in Vegas next to the $9.99 lobsters. Everyone else at my table seemed to enjoy their various pasta dishes( orecchiette, tagliatelle, pici). Only 2 problems. ONE the waiter was hard to get a hold off and didn't stop in frequently enough, probably due to being secluded in the chef's table room. TWO my girlfriend order a soufflé for dessert and it was slightly raw, which was taken back. Besides those slight setbacks I've really it was an excellent experience. Definitely would go back especially after missing out on the foie grad ravioli. Soils 4 stars!!! Good job Mr.Conant!"}
{"text":"The food is 5 stars.  The service is 5 stars.  The wine list is 5 stars.  The price is 5 star-level pricing.  But who cares; it's the best Italian food in Vegas.

But the music is WAY too loud for fine dining.  Do I want a hard rock band screaming at me at obscene decibels when I bite into 4 paper-thin pieces of the best Yellow Tail I've put into my mouth, ever?  No, not for $16.  That's 4 bucks a bite, and the hard core, fingernails on a chalkboard in a megaphone screaming is free.

The wine list is awesome.  Splurge and you'll never regret it.

Their famous spaghetti is famous for a reason.  $26 for pasta and some sauce.  That's it?  Yes.  And it's worth every penny.

The veal is stellar on every level, with the chanterelles, mini-me artichokes, fruit reduction, a hint of cumin, and sweet breads (my sweet breads were a little dry, though).  The veal itself is all the crispy outside, tender/moist inside, and intensity of flavors you're hoping for.

The coconut/guava ice cream desert was very, very good and light.  5 stars.

The cheese course was only okay.  Three small pieces of cheese the size of my thumb underwhelmed me.  I would pass on this next time.  We were spoiled by Providence's cheese course, though.

Awesome capuccino."}
{"text":"The food was great the service was really bad . It was a Saturday night and maybe they were a little busy but when I go on restaurant like this I have high exceptions especially if it's my first time . We ordered the drinks came 20 min late and the server brought us the wrong ones . When we ordered the food it came out fast the only thing it came all out together and got cold so we didn't really enjoy the soup because we were trying to pick up from everything . After we prefer another round with the busier because the waiter  despaired   for a while . It took another 15 min to finally get the drinks but this time he got the order right lol. The duck ravioli and the short rib ravioli were excellent . Also the complimentary bread was delicious. I wish we had a great service that would've been great ."}
{"text":"Having been to the OG location in Manhattan's Meatpacking District, my expectations were going to be high!  

I've been a fan of Scott ever since I've tried out some of his recipes from Bold Italio.  Whom I refer to as the anti Mario Batali.  Conant's sense of `new Italian' cooking is also different from Mario, who, with his love of ramps (a type of leek).  Scott sees himself as adapting the Italian concentration on local ingredients with those ingredients which are local to the farms. 

I started out with the Mussels and Asparagus Soup was hearty which a nice assortments of spring veggies. The polenta with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms was as usual excellent and the Grilled Bread and Goat Cheese Salad were also great starters.  The boneless Osso Busco with orzo pasta was phenomenal.  It was braised in a boldly flavored sauce.  

The spaghetti with tomato and basil seems simple but delicious, a must-try!

This restaurant is in a great spot with nice window views of the Bellagio Fountain ,  Hip and Happening for a Upscale Trattoria and based on how packed it  has hit the ground running on the Strip."}
{"text":"We went here for a bachelorette party dinner during a trip to Vegas.  I would definitely say save your money and go elsewhere.

The restaurant is nice inside the Cosmopolitan but the food was extremely small portioned.  I paid $35 for appetizer special of the day: 2 scallops!  For entree I had the scriti pasta dish.  Good squid ink but very bland in seasoning and also very scant for the price.  Service was good waiter was attentive.  Ambiance left something to be desired.  Someone puked in the ladies bathroom and wasn't cleaned.  

Skip this place and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  We didn't have reservations, so we ended up sitting in one of the booths in the bar, so we missed out on the views that people are speaking of, but there was a full menu there and we didn't feel like waiting for a table.  My husband and I both had the Pici and it was the best pasta I have ever had in my life. Homemade pasta, cooked perfectly and while it was spicy, the spice didn't take over the dish and take away from the flavor. It had huge chunks of lobster in it and was well worth the money.  Bread was delicious as well, along with the eggplant spread."}
{"text":"Food was exquisite. I think turning pasta in general into something amazing is the hardest thing just cause there is not a lot to work with. The ability to match pasta with the right sauce and meat is and art in itself and this place does it for me. I loved my experience and will dine there again"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Cosmopolitan on a Sun night and decided to pop in to Scarpetta after having missed going to the NYC location twice. As a party of one, I ate at the bar and chatted it up with a couple great bartenders - Rico and Jon.  Gave so many good Vegas tips I couldn't keep track...

I get the sense that Scarpetta doesn't book as many reservations as say, STK or Blue Ribbon (my server confirmed they get good overflow traffic) but it'd be a mistake to overlook this place. Overall, excellent food, friendly service and cool scene. I'll be back soon.


Appetizer: Tuna 'Susci' - interesting dish with tuna serving as the nori by wrapping vegetables. so fresh so clean. nice recommendation by the staff and exactly what i was looking for.

Entree: Spaghetti - just very simple and perfectly done. i believe this is something Scarpetta is known for and it delivered.

Dessert: Coconut panna cotta - amazing w/coconut sorbet. not too heavy, great end to the meal."}
{"text":"This is the fine dining restaurant at Cosmopolitan that I've been looking for.  Beautiful restaurant.  Impeccable service.  Great food.  Hip music not played too loud.  Perfect.

We started with the roasted scallops ($17) which is 2 scallops with porcini mushrooms and sunchokes.  It came with some sort of sauce that was unidentifiable.  The flavor of the sauce just didn't come through and was overpowered by the mushrooms and sunchokes.  Still the scallops, mushrooms, and sunchokes were all perfectly cooked and tasty.

Next I tried the Orata Rosso ($33), which is red snapper that comes with tomatoes, chard, and clams (out of the shell).  So yummy!  My husband had the halibut ($30), which came with potatoes.  An interesting combination but really tasty.

The show stealer was the lobster pasta ($35).  Black farfelle with lobster and basil bread crumbs.  Excellent flavor combination, texture, everything.  Black farfelle is kind of interesting to look at, too.

For dessert, we had the peach crostada ($11) - kind of like a peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream and blackberries.  Very good.  We also had the zeppoles ($11), which are beignets stuffed with nutella and covered in chocolate with a very yummy vanilla sauce.  Our latte and cappucino ($6 each) were also very good.

We had a couple glasses of wine which were good.  Pinot Grigio ($10) and Falanghina ($16).  The wine list is a little confusing because they list some wines by the glass and others as quartinos.  But the quartinos are not any larger than a normal glass of wine.  I should have gotten clarification about the difference.  Maybe next time.

The view is decent but not as good as Comme Ca.  Still, I am looking forward to coming back to this restaurant and trying the tasting menu. Hoping this can make my Best of the Best list."}
{"text":"As much as I am critical regarding the outlandish folly that which is the Strip, there are, in my opinion, a few exceptional culinary experiences that you can only get here and nowhere else; with breathtaking, majestic feats of visionary engineering, the Strip personifies man's ability to create way beyond his present environment and envision a future filled with unlimited possibilities.  And when a night on the town includes that man-made wonderland, you get magic, an 'Umami' of all the senses.

Scarpetta by Chef Scott Conant encompasses that dining experience, and out of all his venues bearing the same name, I enjoy the Vegas restaurant by far.  Although all the restaurants are elegant with great food, this restaurant takes the Vegas experience and showcases style with understated design gestures.  'Scarpetta' means little shoe in Italian, a reference to the menu's 'soulfulness'...  Guess my mind wandered to other references...like, the foot fetish variety - shrimping anyone?  No? Too far?

The design is deceptively tame; meaning that it's not drenched in the typical Vegas gaudy, interior so-five-seconds ago gimmicks that cause visual Norovirus.  But once you situate and settle down, you notice the lyrical design flow lending itself to a relaxing, calming evening. By then the Fountains at the Bellagio will have sprung into full effect, with sweeping side views of the Lake and the beautiful architecture as a backdrop for the dynamic geysers bursts - a stunning piece of visual entertainment lasting the night.

After dining at Scarpetta on numerous occasions, I've come to the conclusion that although everything on the menu is good, I naturally gravitate towards the Pasta section of the menu.  I enjoy all of the home made pastas and the balance with the ingredients that Chef Conant pairs with them.  And to be honest, I'm just tired of entrees, they've become burdensome, overpriced and unusually large with the same old formula: big ass protein with some creamy mush underneath it with a side of blah..yawn.  If anything, I'd get some apps, but I've eaten most of them on the menu; I do recommend the Creamy Polenta + Fricassee of Truffled Mushrooms, The Heirloom Beet Salad and the Braised Shortribs of Beef. (They push the Yellowtail as their signature classic- really...if I wanted Sashimi, I'd go eat at a Japanese restaurant where it's served pure, you really don't need any heavy Onions or Olive Oil or Jalapeños to mask the flavor of this delicious protein.....TRUTH).  

Spaghetti + Tomato +Basil: An all time favorite of mine, this dish is as simple as it can get (it's up there with Spaghetti all' Aglio Olio e Pepperoncino) but so fresh and light with just a few ingredients, the Pasta shines through as the main character which, being the carb addict that I am, is harmonious!  It's presented as the first dish, based on its levity and absence of protein.  

Ricotta + Truffle Agnolotti: The second dish in the fete de pasta is a deep contrast to the acidity of the prior dish, the fluffy pillows filled with Ricotta and covered in a light Truffle Cream Sauce.  I love using the term 'pillows', it describes these soft chewy bite size packages of pasta like a metaphoric squishy rest to the head; that, \"ahhh\" moment when your cranium sinks into a downy cloud.....I love sleep..  The creamy Truffle white sauce has just enough weight to coat your palate without any buyer's remorse and the quantity is perfect for two.

Black Tonarelli + King Crab + Coddled Egg + Smoked Trout Roe: I'm always excited when I see Squid Ink Pasta on any menu - I relish the slightly briny noodle that goes well with all Seafood toppings.  With this dish, it's even more decadent with the introduction of the Coddled Egg, coating every strand with a sticky liquid goo. It's such oral satisfaction.  Oh, and there's Crab, you really can't go wrong when there's Crab.  

Pici + Lobster +Preserved Tangerine + Bottarga: Pici is thick cut pasta, a fat spaghetti, akin to Udon.  It is hearty and appropriately the last pasta course of the evening.  The Pici is paired with Lobster, Preserved Tangerine and Bottarga, a cured fish roe.  The Bottarga amps up the salty briny element while the the juicy Lobster gives a sweet delicate flavor - all the ingredients manage to balance out with the Pasta.

Caramella Milk Chocolate Mousse + Sautéed Yellow Peaches + Praline Crunch + Pistachio Bastoni: Okay, this was a bit of a surprise-under our waiter guidance, we ordered this dessert for the first time... this plate of what can only be described as a kindergarden art project with chocolate squares and pistachio logs....  I wonder if the chefs are so bored that they need to play with the food and at the same time give us less.  And in the end, it didn't really have much flavor as compact as it was- it was like a plate of Mignardises that usually come with a post-meal hot beverage.

{"text":"I went there with my Groupon which was enough for two pizzas. The pizza was good enough but not spectacular. Drinks are pricy 16oz Peroni for $10? Come on."}
{"text":"Yes. I am back again. They should start a loyalty program!

We ordered:

1) Fritto Misto:lacked seasoning and portion was too small for $18. Will pass next time.
2) polenta with Trumpet mushroom: still amazing and love how they portion the food into two sets
3) basil and tomato spaghetti: I like this dish a lot and skipped the meatballs this time
4) Pici but replaced the standard pasta with the tagliatelle. It was perfect.

Service excellent and loved bread basket.  I wish there were some new items after coming here so many times in the last 2 years. But will be back"}
{"text":"The pasta is quite good and the place has great ambiance and view but I wouldn't recommend it because it's extremely pricy for the quality."}
{"text":"We ate here celebrating Valentines and my boyfriend is not a big fan of Italian food yet he loved the food as well as I. The ambience was intimate with great view, excellent service very attentive,  lots of options on the menu even the bread was delicious. I'm very selective with Italian food so it was a pleasant surprise and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Where to start? Wow. I really enjoyed this restaurant. The ambience, the service, and the food were truly impeccable. Now, you may think I'm neurotic about lighting but I don't care - it adds a lot to a dining experience. This lighting was just right. Goldilocks would have given a stamp of approval. Likewise for the portion size, which I thought may be too small like most pricey restaurants but it was just enough. The food was amazing. My fiancé had the veal. Mouthwatering. I had the bone marrow and short rib pasta. Tasty. And with my Pinot - extra tasty. Now I'm not a sweet person (you can read that many ways), but the Nutella dessert was worth every last cent! Perfection. Service - impeccable. Well informed, classy, but not intrusive. And he had interesting hair. He also suggested an espresso martini, which was palate-ably scrumptious. And if you go, sit next to the window for a killer view of the Bellagio fountain at night."}
{"text":"We had an absolutely perfect experience at Scarpetta. From the ambience to the service to the food, everything was exemplary. Furthermore, we lucked out with getting a window table with a view overlooking the Bellaggio fountains next door. I started with the legendary tomato-basil spaghetti and quickly understood why it receives such rave reviews! The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the sauce was delightful. My friend was equally pleased with her truffled polenta starter and second course of short rib agnolotti. The roasted scallops I chose were divine. We also shared a side of mixed mushrooms, but could hardly make a dent in them although they were delicious! In true Vegas style, the portions are quite generous. Don't skip on having a cocktail either - our frothy grapefruit gimlets were superb!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I dined here tonight to celebrate his birthday. First, the food was delicious, however the service was not. When we walked in there was no hostess at the podium , so the very nice and attentive bartender went to the podium to greet us and acknowledged my fiancé's birthday. Then the hostess finally came back and showed us to the table. The ambiance was very nice, we had a nice table next to the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. 

When our server finally came, he seemed very rushed and was VERY short with us. The appetizers were not listed on the menu, so we asked him what appetizers we had to choose from and he seemed irritated that he had to explain. After choosing our appetizers we also ordered our entrees before he could walk away. 

My fiancé had the beet salad to start with and I had the spring salad with \"blood orange\" dressing, both were tasty. Then we both had the short rib agnotoli which was delicious, however if you plan on getting stuffed this is not the place to do so since the portions are small. 

Once we finished our entrees after quite some time, the waiter finally came back and we ordered some dessert. We waited about 10-15 minutes for our dessert! I've never waited that long for dessert in my entire life! 

When it was time to pay, we gave the waiter our card. After he ran the card and had our bill in hand, he walked right past us without giving us our card back! After about 5-10 minutes he finally came back! Smh! We've had better service at the Cheesecake Factory! 

Although the food was delicious, we just don't see ourselves returning to the restaurant in the future due to the bad service."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday dinner & it was exceptional.  I just ordered the spaghetti, because I think that's a good measure of an italian restaurant.  They make their pasta in house, and it was delicious.  The sauce was also perfect.  One of my friends got the shortrib ravioli, and it was the tiniest portion ever.  The spaghetti was a good portion though, and the shortrib appetizer was also a good size.  My other friends ordered some special and changed it around about and weren't happy with it, but I think that's what they get for messing with the recipe.  Their bread was also awesome, it was cheesy with pepperoni, delicious.  I would absolutely come back"}
{"text":"I STILL DREAM ABOUT THIS PLACE. 

My boyfriend and I came here one evening in October for dinner. It was probably the best meal I have had in Vegas. Thankfully he made a reservation before, so we got seated with no problems. We were seated close to the window that overlooked the Bellagio fountains. Such a pretty sight!

For dinner, I got the Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti. It was heaven on earth! Such a fresh and flavorful dish. And it was perfectly portioned! I don't remember the names of any of the drinks, but they were delicious and had fresh fruit as well! 

The service wasn't the best, and the set-up seemed a bit cramped, but amazing food and ambiance! I'll hopefully be back when I am in Vegas again!"}
{"text":"The most expensive spaghetti I've ever eaten. But the BEST I've ever eaten. Don't be fooled by the baseball-sized portion. It fills you up (must be the carbs..mmm..). Handmade noodles cooked PERFECTLY al dente and the clean and fresh sauce.. 

Their polenta is delicious as well.. And pretty much all their bread with their little accompaniments. 

It's carb heaven.


But heard the duck ravioli sucked. Just saying."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved eating here. We had another birthday dinner here so we got a table that was overlooking the Bellagio Water Fountain show. We were being a pain to the waiter because we were all undecided by the wines there, but he was patient and I enjoyed their Riesling selection. They have lots of Duck dishes which is not what you'd expect out of an Italian place, but everything is very delicious. If this is your first time, try out the Spaghetti. Sounds plain, but it is really good."}
{"text":"I'm used to the packaged spaghetti and Prego with ground beef and maybe some hot links and mushrooms if I'm feeling fancy. When I saw spaghetti here for $24 and it only had tomato and basil I thought \"How the eff can this beat my fancy spaghetti, there's not even meat!\"
Reading reviews and hearing the waiter's recommendations I figured why not try this \"fancy\" spaghetti. It was a good thing I did because it's the best I've ever had!
The spaghetti noodles were a perfect texture, firm but not too firm, just the right amount. The sauce was a very simple tomato sauce but it was so creamy. It was such a basic dish yet the flavor was so rich. 
If you're lucky enough to sit by the window you can see the Bellagio fountains go off otherwise you'll be seated on the interior which is a little too dark."}
{"text":"Scarpetta, you got my 5 stars!!  I love this place. It was a great night with awesome company. We originally had reservations for Nob Hill but we decided at the last minute to eat here.  

First of all, the seats had soft plush leather.  Luxurious. You know you're in for a treat.  The lighting was perfectly dim. Not too dim you can't even see your hands like some other places. 

The food, the wine, desserts, service is top notch.  Wine was perfect temperature according to one of our diners. Well, the server asked if it was the right temperature before serving it (that was nice touch!), it was a little warm but no problem, he came back and gave us the right one. 
We had from what I can remember, Braised Short Ribs of Beef. (Hey you know this was cooked for a long time, I'm not a chef so I don't know this but the taste had a lot of levels to it) Roasted Sea Scallops that I want to eat forever. Biggest surprise was the Spaghetti. I've never had this pasta before.  It was thicker, definitely cooked right and the sauce was heavenly. We had to order 2 plates of it.  Agnalotti which had guess what in it? I don't know. It doesn't matter, it was terrific.  Everyone picked on my plate when I ordered that one. Then for dinner Black Cod which was cooked to perfection. I'm in love. Where's the heart icon here on Yelp?  

For dessert, we ordered everything they had and the waiter wrote \"happy birthday\" on my plate with chocolate souffle. Sorry I didn't eat the other desserts but they were all raving about it.  

First time I had this type of Pinot Noir. Seaport? Not sure about the name but I didn't get a headache the next day. We were out until 3 am. We went to Marquee, got in, right away and didn't have to get in line (maybe because we had dinner at Scarpetta?) and I was up cheery eyed at 9:30 the next day."}
{"text":"Meh, food is pretty average. Not to mention they were closed by the health department at one point in time. Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant was incredible. Our server was wonderful . The food was delicious and the ambiance was incredible. Definitely request window seating because we got a pretty decent view as well! 

I got the lobster pici with chili almond pesto and it was absolutely delicious! My sister ordered the bruschetta and the seared scallops. Both dishes were very well made although there were super SMALL portions! I highly recommend this restaurant! Especially if you are looking for high quality italian fusion. 

I recommend making a reservation because we were in there on a Tuesday in the summer and it was still packed!"}
{"text":"During my first stay in Vegas I knew I needed to plan out where I wanted to fine dine. After combing through many reviews I made a reservation at  Scarpetta a week in advance. The three stars are given more for the ambience then the food. Our table looked out to the Bellagio and we were able to watch the fountain show as we dined. 

Great disappointment fell over me as I began to eat the Farmer's Market Salad. Beautiful yes, full of wonder fresh veggies BUT unless you got a mouthful of pecorino in every bite it was severely under seasoned. 

We both ordered pasta dishes. My bf the duck foie gras ravioli and I the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti. The pasta itself was light and delicious. The Marsala reduction on the duck foie gras was a little powerful over the duck flavor but overall a good dish. However, the horseradish flavor in the agnolotti was so overpowering it left my palette craving to be cleansed after each mouthful. 
 

I'm glad I tried Scarpetta but based on this visit not sure I would be willing to give it another opportunity to disappoint."}
{"text":"I tried the tasting menu with wine pairing and I nearly died from how full I became.  I ordered the tasting menu because I was unsure about what to chose from the menu - there were quite a few dishes I was torn between and I decided to just give them all a shot since a lot of the items i wanted to try was on the tasting menu.

The food and wine pairing was a great experience.  The service was impeccable - they gave me extra dishes to sample in addition to my tasting menu.  The fresh made potato chips sitting at the bar was also a temptation that I kept on coming back for.  

The stand out dishes I tried that night were:

Polenta - wow, never had I had polenta as silky as this before.  The mushrooms and sauce were perfect with the polenta.  I savored every bit of it.

Spaghetti - this definitely hit the spot.  The noodles were hand made and the sauce was quite simple, but elegant.  A very simple dish but I was in love with it.

Short Rib Agnolotti - The first few bites were surprising, but what I loved about it would be the kick the horseradish that was in the sauce gave it.  Each bit teased my tongue and I couldn't help but go back for seconds!

Spiced Duck Breast - My favorite dish from all of the ones I tried that night.  The duck breast was very tender, had a bit of au jus in them and didn't have a game-y taste to it.  The duck breast was cooked to perfection, with the meat being so very tender and the skin having a bit of a crunch to it and the endive and sauce went so well with it.  

It was a lovely dining experience.  I wouldn't mind coming again and ordering one of these delightful dishes a la cart."}
{"text":"I ordered the spaghetti and was not disappointed. It was excellent. The views of the Bellagio fountains were amazing. Make reservations and get a nice table in the back-don't sit in the bar. Dress up. Very classy place with extensive wine list."}
{"text":"I didn't have reservations and it was a last minute decision to dine here for a party of 6. The host was very accomodating but we had to wait 30-45mins for a table... not that big of a deal but I was starving! Ambience is nice, could be very romantic. However, we were seated right under the ac vent and it was fuhreezingggg

- Braised Short Rib - the beef was soo tender and flavorful. I definitely recommend this as an appetizer. The risotto was good in texture, however wasn't too crazy about the vegetable medley they had in there.

- Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti - I liked this pasta the best (of what I tried). It just seemed weird that the agnolotti seemed to be cut in half, is that normal? In any case, rich in flavor, the short rib was good and went well with the sauce.

- Ravioli - I can't find it on their menu online.. but it was delicious and had burst of great truffle flavor. Very creamy though and not sure I would be able to eat a whole entree of this myself. But definitely worth a try for anyone who isn't scared of cream & cheese!

Oh yea, and the house bread... BOMB. So goood. Each slice was like a surprise, either with basil(?) or bacon and served with butter (of course), olive oil, and a bruschetta type spread that was very fresh and light.

Overall, very happy with the experience -- but it could also be because i was super hangry :)"}
{"text":"This is one of the finest establishments in all of alas Vegas. The service is incredible, it is second only to the food. My girlfriend and I came here for our three year anniversary.

{"text":"My wife and I came here for our 2nd year wedding anniversary.  I made a reservation that morning for 8 pm. We had the following:

Corn soup with King crab fritters $19

Short Rib Agnolotti $26

Alaskan Halibut $40

Coconut Souffle $15

When we arrived at the restaurant, we waited about 20 minutes on a Thursday with reservation. We could see it was extremely busy which made me really excited to try Scott Conant's food. When we were seated, we were surprised to see what an awesome view of the Strip the resto had. As far as the food, it was pretty good. My wife said she loved the corn soup as it was not too sweet and they actually left some kernels in the soup to give it a texture contrast. The agnolotti was good. It was quite a rick tasting dish so maybe next time I'll ask for a lemon to squeeze on it or something. The halibut was a good dish after the pasta as it tasted very healthy with the vegetable broth surrounding the fish. The coconut souffle was awesome! It goes on my top 5 dessert list in vegas for sure. The service was great. We were seen by our waiter numerous times and our water was always filled. The only thing I would say negative was that the pasta was a little saturated in butter too much for my liking. Overall, I would scarpetta is a good romantic resto if you're looking for upscale italian food."}
{"text":"Reserve a table!
This place is great! We were barely able to squeeze in a reservation during Labor weekend, but it was well worth it. The staff is extremely nice and tentative.

Their starter bread is amazing! They give you a basket with different varieties of bread as well a three toppings: Mascarpone  butter, eggplant, and citrus olive oil. This is probably one of these best bread starters I've had.

The best dish was the Short Rib and Bone Marrow Agnolotti. Cocktails were delicious as well."}
{"text":"Great Italian food!  I went there last night with my dad and sister.  Everyone loved the food.  The pizza looked really good.

It looked very yummy.  I will be back!"}

We made a reservation here and were all excited to be judgmental pricks about the food (you know, the way Scott is on Chopped). But IT WAS AMAZING. WE COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING TO JUDGE HARSHLY.

First, try to request a table by the window/with a view. The restaurant has an amazing view of the Bellagio fountain at night. 

We did the tasting menu and it was TOTALLY WORTH IT. One of the best meals I've ever had and SO FILLING. Second tip: DO NOT fill up on the delicious bread at the beginning of the meal if you are doing the tasting menu. We were so stuffed but we actually finished our whole meal. The waiter commented that we were the first to actually finish the tasting menu in a month because everyone fills up on bread and ends up not being able to finish their dishes. 

Amazing food. IMO highlights were the creamy polenta and black cod."}
{"text":"So while at a convention in Vegas, my two co-workers and I came here for dinner on 10/6/13 on a recommendation from a friend who claimed it's the best restaurant in the city. All three of us did the tasting menu ($110 per person) and two of us opted for the wine pairing with it (additional $45 per person). With all the delicious looking options on the menu, it seemed this was the way to go. Here's what was included: 

-DUO OF YELLOWTAIL AND TUNA \"SUSCI\". Wine pairing: Adami, Prosecco, Veneto, n/v. The \"susci\" was the first tasting and my least favorite of all. Nothing special to me. Or at least I didn't get what was supposed to be special about it. The roll with the carrots was kind of gross actually. I was hoping things would turn around quickly, and they did. Ohhhh they did.

-ROASTED DIVER SCALLOPS, MORELS, SUGAR SNAP, WATERMELON RADISH & PEA FROTH. Wine pairing: Iberian Remix, Albarino, Edna Valley 2009. 
The scallops were cooked perfectly and I enjoyed the puree that was served on the side. My friend however didn't enjoy the wine that was paired with it. He's a big Albarino drinker and said it tasted like \"it was sitting on the shelf a little too long.\" I didn't really notice that until he said it, but I have to agree. That could have just been a bad bottle though and not an accurate representation of the wine itself.


-SPAGHETTI TOMATO BASIL & SHORT RIB AGNOLOTTI. Wine pairing: Il Poggione, Rosso di Montalcino, Tuscany 2008. I don't care what anyone says- the spaghetti was fantastic. I'm drinking the Kool-Aid here. Yes, the sauce is very simple, but it really made me notice and appreciate the texture and freshness of the noodles more. Sometimes spaghetti is better when it's simple I guess. I would definitely order it again. 

The short rib agnolotti- dish of the night. The three of us unanimously agreed on this. One of the best pasta dishes I've ever devoured in 10 seconds. The horseradish breadcrumbs were a great finishing touch.

-FENNEL SPICED BLACK COD, CONCENTRATED TOMATOES, MANTECATO & BLACK OLIVE OIL. Wine pairing: Jermann Red Angel, Pinot Noir, Friuli 2008. 
The cod was spiced well, but maybe a tad undercooked for my liking. I still finished it. 

-SPICED DUCK BREAST, ENDIVE, PRESERVED ORANGE &
CIPPOLLINI. Wine pairing: Feudi di San Gregorio, Rubrato, Aglianico, Campania 2009. The duck was perfectly cooked and had tremendous flavor. My friend sitting next to me was already so stuffed by this point, that he couldn't eat his, so being the fat fuck that I am, I ate his too.

-AMEDEI CHOCOLATE CAKE TOASTED ALMOND GELATO. Wine pairing: Quinta do Noval, Colheita, Tawny Port, Portugal 1997. I'm normally not a big dessert guy, but this cake was outstanding. Perfect way to cap off the tasting.

...and here were a few complimentary items our table was given to share:

- BREAD BASKET. It was served with three different dips (citrus olive oil, tomato-eggplant, and marscapone butter). Some of the pieces of bread had salami baked into it, and those were amazing! Just try not to fill up on them if you're doing the tasting menu, because you have A LOT of food on the way.

- CREAMY POLENTA WITH FRICASSEE OF TRUFFLED MUSHROOMS. The polenta was definitely one of the highlights, although it could have benefited from being a tad thicker since the mushroom sauce liquified it significantly, once mixed  in. But great flavors, nonetheless.

- SHOE STRING CALAMARI AND ZUCCHINI. I think there was some fennel in here too. We finished every last string.


All three of us immensely enjoyed the tasting menu. To say that we were not left disappointed by the portion sizes would be an understatement. We could barely walk out of there without toppling over. I certainly didn't have much room for alcoholic beverages for the remainder of the night. Probably a good thing, knowing me and Vegas.

You might notice I didn't have much to say about the wines. That's because unlike the food, they were all pretty unremarkable. I'm a pretty avid wine drinker and I didn't recognize any of these wines by name before they were poured for me, so it was almost expected. If I ever did the tasting menu again, I'd most likely skip the wine pairing option and just order a bottle of something decent and familiar off their wine menu. 

My biggest gripe about this place was the waiter. Although friendly and accommodating, he could barely be heard over the background noise, and with his thick accent, it made him very difficult to understand. Tastings obviously are supposed to be interactive and I had to ask him to repeat everything he said at least once. This became a little frustrating and kind of depreciated the experience for me. I wish he had left a copy of the menu on our table so I didn't have to go to their website afterward to finally discover what some of the things I ate were.

The bottom line is I would definitely return to Scarpetta, especially since I just realized there is one in Beverly Hills (doh!)."}
{"text":"Recently dined at Scarpetta during a work trip to Vegas and loved every minute! First of all, The Cosmopolitan is a beautiful hotel; arguably the nicest the Vegas. It's so chic and luxe, you can't help but feel sophisticated while there. Scarpetta itself is also very, very nice. My co-worker and I were seated by the window with an amazing view of the Bellagio water show. Fabulous! But more importantly, the food was delicious! Everything from the cocktails to the bread basket was wonderful. We ordered the berry smash cocktails (perfect and not too sweet!), scallops, heirloom tomato salad, spaghetti (simple yet amazing), short rib ravioli and the best dessert on the planet, the cinnamon sugar donuts with warm nutella in the middle and caramelized bananas on the side (are they for real?!?). 

Bottom line, if you're in town you MUST go to Scarpetta. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Scarpetta has been on my list of restraurants to try for a long time.  I never got a chance when I used to live in NYC, so during my trip to Vegas, it was an obvious choice.  I was so excited!

We ordered the yellowtail carpaccio and the octopus to share. Although both were good, it lacked the wow factor I was expecting from a restaurant of this caliber. The pink salt on the yellowtail was a nice touch but was missing a lot of the acid I usually like with my fish. In other words it was quite bland. The octopus was nothing to write about. We opted not to get the famous spaghetti because another pasta dish caught my eye which in retrospect was probably a mistake. But, how can you turn down squid ink linguine with lobster? This dish was decent, not great. There was a lack of sauce altogether. The squid ink although pleasing to the eye, was too mild in flavor for my liking. For the main entree we got the black cod and the branzino. The cod was delicious. I loved the flaky buttery meat and the roasted tomatoes which gave this dish some Italian flair. The Branzino was overly rich and neither of my girlfriends finished the dish. 

Maybe this place was too hyped up for me.  It was a huge let down. The ambiance was quite nice, dark and sexy. But we did not get a window table with a view of the fountains as I had requested. Probably wont be trying the one in NY"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and amazing service! Will definitely be coming back tomorrow! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I would say, \"so so\".  Ambiance was nice.  But food did not feel special. I had the short rib ravioli with bone marrow infused.  It was eh...

The ribeye was just \"alright\".

If you are bringing a client there, great choice.  But for fine dining, there are better choices.

Price is reasonable, but not cheap.  Our check came up to $315 for 4 people (excluding wine)."}
{"text":"The view I had was amazing! I was able to look out and see the Bellagio dancing fountains! I tried the chef's tasting menu and everything I had was delicious! It was pricey, but you pay for what you get and I definitely had way more than I thought I was going to get! The servers change your dishes and silverware every time there was a new dish. I love places that do that because that is great service and quality. Definitely a date place. I love it! Must try!"}
{"text":"Open Table wasn't showing any reservation openings and we wanted to go after seeing the K? Cirque Du Soleil. My husband called and easily made a reservation. When we arrived we were seated right away (even after arriving early). 

AMBIANCE: is beautiful and we got seated next to a window with a great view of the Bellagio water fountain. 

BREAD: The bread came in a delicious assortment along with citrus infused olive oil, marscapone butter, and eggplant. SO GOOD. 

BEVERAGE: I ordered a cocktail which I am having trouble remembering the name but it was great. 

FOOD: I ordered the Tagliatelle (Truffle zabaglione, guanciale & spring vegetables). The pasta was perfection in both texture and tasta. Very tasty, good portion, & I would definitely order it again. 

SERVICE: was wonderful (because we are young we often get treated with less quality service at more upper class restaurants - no issues here though)

Scarpetta is on the pricier side of Las Vegas dining but we didn't walk away regretting anything."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Scott Conant fan. His food is my food, yo. 

Went back last weekend and the boyf and I went full throttle. 3 pastas! That's how we roll! 

I've never had an entree here, I could leave most of the appetizers (except for a ridiculously awesome gazpacho), but the pasta is SICK. 

Ratings:
#1 Spaghetti with tomato sauce:  OK- how does he do it? It's some pasta, it's some tomato sauce. Why is this heaven? It's tart, rich, chewy- this could be a whole meal. I've scoured the interwebs and come up with a pretty good approximation of his sauce (hint, infused olive oil, fast cooking times, butter, fresh basil, and grated parmigiano play a big role). But that pasta, how is it fresh and al dente all at once? The waiters are all coy minxes about this one. 

#2 Foie Gras ravioli: Very rich, cloying in a good way: super umami and flavor town. This doesn't skimp on the foie. We love it. 

#3 Stracci- Leek and shellfish rough cut pasta. Subtle and awesome, the pasta is again the star of the show. It's silky and coated in a wonderful leek sauce. I'm a salt nut and thought this could have been more heavily seasoned. 

#4 Truffle tagliarelle- Special last weekend. We had to try it. This was almost too subtle. It was almost refreshing, which you wouldn't expect from a cream and truffle based sauce. 

#5 Lobster Black Farfalle- Actually, the truffle and the lobster were at around the same level for me. This was again very subtle, deliciously textured pasta, the lobster was happy, but not the star. 

It's all great here, but if you don't get the spaghetti with pasta sauce, you're doing yourself a disservice. 

Atmosphere is fine, if you can, request a table close to the window to view the Bellagio water show. 

Waitstaff is generally good. The sommelier really upsells his wine, especially the expensive stuff, which is lame (I bet he'll tell you to try some Peter Michael stuff which is like 3x+ the retail here). But on the plus side, the wine he's chosen is truly good. We had an insanely awesome white burgundy and I have to stop this review right now to go look up the name."}
{"text":"An absolutely fantastic meal.  Mike was our waiter and he provided absolutely phenomenal recommendations.  We had the scallops which were truly orgasmic and out of this world,  the raviolis with foie gras was a heavenly savory dish.  The lamb and octopus/ calamari we had were also deliciously decadent. Our wine expert steered us to a spectacular red that worked with every course. And then Mike surprised us with a dessert that blew our minds: Italian doughnuts that made my girlfriend believe in angels, God, and the afterlife. In essence, our best meal in Vegas and perhaps for many months."}
{"text":"Located on the third floor on restaurant row and a hallway's distance from the newly erected Chelsea, the restaurant was elegant with a cool jazzy swagger to it. Warm Edison style lighting cascading above with a panoramic window view of the Bellagio fountains! What more could you ask for? Well, yeah great service comes with your reservation as well. Our server Titus was a pro! He was thoughtful friendly and attentive. That said, the supporting staff and sommelier were equally charming and helpful.  

I decided on the New Year's Eve pre fixe, no brainer right with a bottle of bubbly to accompany the memorable experience. 

Our first course was a tuna tartare prepared with pine nuts and topped with micro greens. The texture was light with a supple mouthfeel. It had a subtle nutty flavor to it tasting almost like a steak tartare, which I adore.  Two small toastettes accompanied this whimsically delicious starting dish, as well.


Second course was a roasted sea scallop topped with foie gras and served with a butternut squash raisin caper caponata. Now I've had my share of scallop dishes and for the most part I'm usually left feeling underwhelmed  but not with this dish. Foie gras and scallops are like a match made in foodie heaven. The thick and beautifully seared scallop medallion paired with rich velvety foie gras and the sweet & salty tang of the creamy butternut squash and caper caponata made each bite a flavor explosion in my mouth. Superb!


Just when I thought it couldn't get better, the following dish blew me away! A pumpkin ravioli topped with crumbled amaretto cookies. The Hand made ravioli was soft and perfectly cooked, the creamy pumpkin coupled with crunchy amaretto cookies was a play on all my senses! The sweet flavor and fragrant aroma also made this intoxicating dish not only decadent  but a satisfying flavor journey I'd gladly take again and again! 


The final savory dish was a wagyu beef served atop a creamy mash with spinach. Now this dish speaks for itself. You simply can't go wrong with perfectly medium rare wagyu beef. It just melts in your mouth, literally! It's a symphony of delights from start to finish. Encore! 

From the amazing cuisine, exceptional service, sleek & cool environs and awesome view, I really couldn't ask for more out of a wonderfully unforgettable NYE dinner.

Bravo Scarpetta!!!"}
{"text":"Very good. My NY Strip was excellent. Pasta also very good. Chicken was good. Nice setting. If you get a seat by the window you can watch the fountains at Bellagio."}
{"text":"Umm wow!!

Where do I start??

VIEWS, BREAD, POLENTA, PASTA!

Best views of the Bellagio fountain show while enjoying a top notch dinner! I had a window seat and it was just amazing to watch the water show every few minutes while overlooking the strip.

The bread was amazing! Eggplant dipping sauce yum!

The following was ordered:
Mushroom Polenta - give me a pot of this I will down it in one sitting. So flavorful. Such great texture. I know what you're thinking \"why would I come here to order a mash potato dish\" don't be fooled people- it's pure heaven.

The spaghetti - by far the best spaghetti I've ever had. The tomatoes and Basel sauce was to die for. The pasta was cooked just perfectly -al dente .  It's simple but great.

Short rib agnolotti - what can I saw - sweet yet savory. Filling yet not enough to cut your appetite to see what's next.  Remember gusher the fruit snack? This is like an adult version... No joke!

Pici - pesto lobster pasta with tarragon. Warning this can be a little spicy for some people, but if you like spicy this is your dish. The amount of lobster in the dish was perfect and so fresh. The dish in general is something that is so unorthodox - like a spicy pesto? Who does that- well Scarpetta did and they did it perfectly!

We didn't have enough room for dessert but at least I got to try 3 pastas that are now on my top 10 list!

Service was five star also!!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What do you do when you're too cracked out to go clubbing in Vegas? You eat at a fancy restaurant of course. 

Despite the reservations we were not seated as promptly as I would like, but the wait was not too long. We did request to be seated where we could see the fountains, a wish that went unfulfilled.I understand Vegas was at its capacity that weekend so I suppose it is forgivable though disappointing. We had the braised short ribs, spaghetti, and the duck & foie gras ravioli. We ended the meal with an unmemorable custard. 

Our waiter was excruciatingly nice, checking up on us every few minutes, never daring to let the water drain completely from our cups. He even remembered my boyfriend from his last business trip there.

The eggplant spread, short ribs, the spaghetti were nothing short of magnificent especially the spaghetti which lived up to all of its hype. I could eat an entire barrel of that spaghetti in all its simplistic perfection. My only issue was that my ravioli was so salty I could barely eat it. It won't deter me from coming back again though."}
{"text":"It was a nice modern style restaurant. The menu noted that the pasta was imported from a place called Scarpetta. (I'll look it up one of these days) The ambience was nice but however it might have been too dark and dim mainly because my eyes started to hurt after awhile. (*I ate with a large group. We were given a private room which was a bonus.)

I ordered a Mediterranean Branzini (fish). It looked beautiful on the plate which is always nice. After taking one bite, I noticed that the skin was extremely crispy but unfortunately the fish came out a bit dry. The dish was really depended on the sauce for it to work for me. The dish was also served with thinly sliced leeks, two tiny shrimps, and two mussels. The shrimp and leeks were delicious but the mussel was a bit gritty. I'm not sure if that's really my thing but the flavor was good though. 

This dish was worth a shot but I preferred the dishes that others in my party enjoyed such as short rib Agnalotti, Kobe beef, and some kind of chicken dish. The chicken that I sample was completely moist. I was very surprised and at the time was very jealous that I didn't ordered that instead.

Anyways, there was a complimentary salami/cheese bread in the bread basket. I recommend it. Don't forget to try the creamy dessert of pana cotta and guava. It was very sweet, refreshing, and light."}
{"text":"Beautiful new restaurant at the Thompson Hotel on Wellington just shy of a month old.  With a grand open space concept, large mahogany booths that snake through the center of the room and   full height wine racks that require a ladder to reach the top shelves.  With your meal illuminated by soft blue spotlights, this place tastefully whispers \"Yes, I want your beautiful, sophisticated money\".

The Italian menu focuses, and highlights season ingredients while keeping the traditional items you'd expect to see at an Italian restaurant.

For starters we had the Raw Waygu Beef with mushrooms, hazelnuts and parmigiano.  Smooth and silky textures with a beautiful hint of dare I say.. Dorrito flavours.

We split their Tomato & Basil Spaghetti because that's what they're known for, and it didn't disappoint. Their pasta is handmade and cooked to perfection.  The sauce was flavourful, but not overbearing and stuck to the pasta very nicely.  It was an amazingly light and tasty mid course.

For mains we had the Ocean Trout and the Duck Breast, I liked the Trout far more than my Duck.  It had amazingly crispy skin, accompanying fatty tender meat. However, my duck wasn't hot when served and felt chewier than I would've liked.  They listed mustard seeds as one of the ingredients, and I could see it, just not taste it.

The service was impeccable and our waitress and sommelier were incredibly friendly.  The bus boys were attentive and professional, and kept our wine flowing and our table clean.

Dinner came to $210sh before tip, which included a bottle of wine, dessert and coffee.  I want to give it 4 stars, but my main was just disappointing enough that I can't.  I would go back and try their other dishes when they've been open for a bit longer and found their groove."}
{"text":"I have been the Scarpetta in New York City about 4 times. And each time I go, I have to get (at least for an app) the exact same thing. I cannot recommend the spaghetti marinara strongly enough. The rest of the food we ordered was great-- but this is just the perfect bowl of pasta.

Having said that-- the NYC restaurant had superior service. They were busy, but it seemed like our waiter, who had our table first, had about 5 other tables sit down at the exact same time after us-- so our service was quite slow. (although, still very friendly). I think that is way more the problem of management to sit 5 tables in one waiters section all at once. I felt like it took at least 20 minutes to flag down the waiter to get our check delivered to us.

Again-- food was great, service was slow because it was so crowded... they should do something to rectify that situation."}
{"text":"Service and food was spot on.  Even though we came earlier than our actual reservations, the hostess was still able to seat us immediately and we also got to sit close to the window to see the Bellagio water show.  Our server was friendly and very helpful.  We ladies weren't sure what wines to drink with our dinner so our server was nice enough to let us try a few of their wines so we can decide on our choice.  

My DH had the beet salad and the duck ravioli.  He was in heaven.  Every time he put a ravioli in his mouth, he was saying, \"Oh my god, Oh my god this is so good.\"

We also had the creamy polenta for appetizer, that was also a big hit.  I had the spaghetti.  It sounds plain, but was the best I've ever eaten.  Seriously.   I wanted to hate this restaurant so much because Scott Connant is such a stickler for his pasta on \"Chopped\".  I was ready to pounce out a bad review because the pasta was not right, or the seasoning was off.  But I have to say I had nothing to complain about, it was utterly a fantastic experience and the pasta was awesome! Even the stromboli bread that they brought out left me speechless.  Ok, so not speechless where I couldn't ask for more, but you get the picture.  Scott, well done!!!"}
{"text":"We had late reservations on a Sunday, but it was still extremely crowded and even with reservations we had to wait 20 minutes. I was a little annoyed by having to wait, especially that late, but we ended up with a table that overlooked the Bellagio fountain so that was nice.

As everyone else has said, the portions are smaller than what people are used to but I actually liked that as my friend and I were able to split an app, and then each order an entree and split an additional entree as a middle course. The middle course was the spaghetti as we had heard good things, however we didn't find it to be anything special and it came out luke warm. However, we also had the Creamy Polenta, Stracci, and Black Farfalle which were all amazing!"}
{"text":"Thomas Keller needs to eat here.

Why?

When Keller was contemplating opening a restaurant in Vegas, he refused to consider putting up a branch of The French Laundry there because, in his opinion, Vegas was too informal and boisterous for an experience which intended to be intensely focused and all-encompassing.

Scarpetta, however, proves that this idea is outdated.

This is a restaurant, located right in the center of the action on the Las Vegas strip which, despite the non-ending commotion, offers an experience in which the diner is able to enjoy the entirety of a meal without nary a distraction.

Las Vegas, instead of detracting from the experience of a fine meal, is now enhancing it."}
{"text":"Waiter was unfriendly and not welcoming.    Waited overlong for him to come to table.   He came too take and only said, \"do you have any questions\".   We said , \"lots, what do you recommend?\"     He flipped open a menu, pointed at each section and said something like top 3, top 2' etc as he pointed at each section.   No other comments, such as why they are recommended, etc.....then said, \"any other questions\".  We said ,\"guess not\".  And he walked away.....no drink order request, nothing.....waited about 10 minutes and got up and left.   At least 4 employees watched us leave and never acknowledged us.     Will never return.   Fyi ate dinner at Giadas at the Cromwell the night before....it received 5 stars.   Go there instead."}
{"text":"Amazing. This place succeeds in every way, from the food, to the service, to the atmosphere. As it should when you're paying $$$$ for dinner. Another bonus is that if you're not impressed by all the meat and seafood dishes on the menu, they have a separate vegetarian menu for freaks like me. All you have to do is ask. I was beyond happy. Much to my surprise, elegant dining can be found on the strip."}
{"text":"Came here Friday night for dinner, to celebrate my friend's birthday. One of my friends had heard about the original NYC restaurant and it came recommended, so we were excited to try the LV outpost. The food did not disappoint. First, I'd like to give a shoutout to the service - our waiter was fantastic and actually remembered our food preferences, which is so nice of him. The service was speedy but they didn't hover - we never felt rushed, which was what every restaurant experience should feel like.  We started off the complimentary bread basket - this was the most amazing bread basket I've ever had. There are several varieties of bread - there is a non vegetarian bread too, so if you're vegetarian let the waiter know beforehand and they'll bring out the vegetarian versions only. For the table, we ordered the seafood antipasto appetizer. The kitchen did accommodate our request to have the seafood and the vegetables be separated to keep it vegetarian, which was class. My favorite of the vegetarian antipasto was the squash, which was perfectly complemented with the Calabrian tomato dipping sauce. Onto the main course - one of my friends and I shared our dished. We ordered the the spaghetti (no meatballs) and the parmesan ravioli. To finish off, we ordered the chocolate cake to share between the four of us. It was good, but the interior wasn't as molten as I would have preferred. One thing to note - they didn't add a candle for my friend's dessert, even though we mentioned it on our OpenTable reservation. Not sure if they don't do at all, or forgot to for us. Still, it was a great dinner and a restaurant I recommend dining at in Vegas, especially if you like pasta."}
{"text":"Came here for a special occasion after Nora's Wine Bar closed.  We needed something that would wow us.  The ambiance certainly did, the service was great, and the food certainly did at times.

We did the tasting menu.  And the bottom line is that we were very happy, but not as happy as we could possibly be.  The expectation was high, and so was the price...so at the price we really needed it to come through for a 5 star rating...it ended as a 4 or 4.5 star experience for us.

There were a few items that left us wanting.  The spaghetti was good, but not the best thing I ever ate good (pasta or tomato... either way it was just above average good.)    The spaghetti was simple and lacked anything to set it off as truly amazing--coming off above-average, but slightly flat.  Likewise we enjoyed the duck & foie gras ravioli, but not at the raved about level we hoped for. The raviolis were overly rich and lacking balance...we were vary happy to just have a small portion in the tasting menu.

Some of our favorites were black cod, branzino, yellowtail, and creamy polenta with fricassee of truffled mushrooms.

We were also happy with the bread basket...how can you not be though?...a bread basket that includes a stromboli of rolled with cheeses and salami...yes please!

We had an amazing seat overlooking the Bellagio Fountains."}
{"text":"Simply Amazing.


There is a very tough choice when dining at the Cosmo because they have amazing offerings.  Scarpetta is one of those choices that I believe is a must.

The ambiance is very nice, and if you get there at a good time, you can request a table by the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains for some dinner entertainment.

There were 7 of us in my party, so I got to try quite a few things.  Service was on par with any high end restaurant which is good.

Bread - They give you four variations of bread, all good.  The standout is the Stromboli.  The bread comes with three dips which are Eggplant, Olive Oil with Lime and Marscapone Butter.  The eggplant dip was amazing.

Steak Tartar - This dish was fabulous and is my main recommendation for appetizer.  It is perfectly seasoned and finished off with a tiny quail egg on top. The toast points are also seasoned, buttered and toasted to add that buttery nutty flavor to the bite.

Fried Lemon Grass and Char - This dish was unique.  It was little strands tempura-like fried bits of lemon grass and fish mixed together.  I said Char because I believe that is what it was, but I cannot be for certain.  It was very simple and very good but I could take it or leave it for the price.

Scallops - Careful with this dish as you only get two.  I understand they are a luxury type item but for 21$ or how much ever it was, two scallops did not go a long way.  They were your average good scallop.

Foie Gras & Duck Ravioli - The star of the night.  This dish was simply perfect.  From flavor balance, quantity of food, to execution...it was a hit.  If you come here and don't at least try it, you are missing out.

Filet - The filet was cook medium rare (which is the way I like it) and was very soft as it should be.  That being said, it was a filet.  A normal good filet that you can get from any great steakhouse.  The star of that dish was actually the accompanying potatoes.  Mashed with garlic, sauteed spinach, sun dried tomatoes and a cheese that I could not recognize.

Chicken - OK yes, someone ordered chicken.   The one dish everyone always passes over at restaurants because...well, its chicken.  That being said, I was given about a fourth of the chicken because they were full and I must admit.  It was tasty as hell.  The skin is cooked on it to make it very crispy with seasonings that go a long way.  The bird itself was moist so that you had to use hardly any effort for it to shred apart in your mouth.  If I ever ordered chicken in a restaurant, this would be the one.  Its also a HUGE portion in terms of high end restaurant portions.

I would go back here in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Fellow Food Network junkies don't even need to be told why I lobbied to get to this place. I only need say one name to explain anything: SCOTT CONANT.  His rep is for fine Italian dining, and after having been a fan of his for umpteen years, the time had finally come to see if there was substance behind the style.

The answer is YAAAASSS, baby, and in spades, deuces, clubs...however you want to put it!  The restaurant is appointed in blond and dark woods and beautiful, but the real selling point is the HUGE picture windows that open out to the Strip, but ESPECIALLY the Dancing Fountains across the street at the Bellagio.  When you make a reservation or walk-in, make sure you ask for THAT seating.  You won't regret it.

The menu's not WAR AND PEACE-sized, so it wasn't difficult to make choices.  We opened with the Creamy Polenta (an absolute bull's-eye for me) and the Diver Scallops and Foie Gras for Bear, (which he shared generously - not a seafood fan at all, but the foie gras was fatty, sumptuous and completely decadent.)

Now, if you follow him on the Food Network, everyone knows that he's the \"pasta guy\", so I expected it to be pretty much close to perfect, when I ordered the Short Rib Agnolotti and the Spaghetti.  And how were they? Let's just say I have no idea where the hell that Agnolotti has been all my life, but if I weren't married to Bear already, I might have had to look into the possibilities of pledging my undying love to a plate of pasta.  And the Spaghetti?  Fits RIGHT in with Scott's philosophy about what makes it perfect: not soggy and not toothsome, with the right 'mouth feel', as they say, and a terrific marinara to grace it with. Meanwhile, Bear kept on the seafood tip with the Branzino, and gushed that he hadn't had fish that delicate or deliciously prepared, since our experiences at our adopted \"second home\" in Baltimore's Little Italy, La Tavola.

Now, with Chef Conant's and this place's rep, and the food being FANTASTIC, you may ask why not a full five stars? Well, there is a reason, and it has to do with the service. 

We were gifted with a $200 Cosmopolitan gift card, which is what prompted me to urge Bear to give this place a shot. We'd already been to other Cosmo eateries, and the experiences were fine, but we were looking for EXCEPTIONAL, which this almost was...until the bill came due.  Turns out, the waiter explained when he came back the first time, that he didn't know how to process the card, since the number on the back wasn't working - something like that.  Bear, getting understandably perturbed, asked him to try it again.  And again, he came back, very sheepish and apologetic, and said again that the card wasn't \"taking\".

Not sure how this whole thing was ultimately resolved - I do believed the manager had to get involved at some point - but this hitch at the end was a SNAFU that dampened the whole experience for us.  We will probably be back...but it may not be for a while."}
{"text":"Couldn't be more happy with my experience here. The ambiance was beautiful and we were seated at the window with a fantastic view of the Bellagio. Then the staff was sublime. All of them were so friendly, knowledgable, and the service they provided was top notch. Our waiter Matt even gave us a plate of complimentary treats to congratulate me on my graduation from nursing school. 

Now for the food. The drinks were great and even the bread basket was next level. The Stromboli were amazing as well as the spreads for the bread. The special carpaccio was outstanding providing bursts of flavor and texture. Then my creamy polenta with fricaseed mushrooms was out of this world life changing. My mom's squid ink pasta with crab and uni was unbelievable! And my duck and foie ravioli was so luscious. Our coconut Panna cotta was a wonderful way to end a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"Love this place.... good vibe, romantic and good good food. I will definitely be back for the bone marrows pasta!!!"}
{"text":"What a memorable night it was! First, I definitely would request a window view of the Bellagio water show if you can, because my boyfriend and I saw three shows while enjoying our dinner. Scarpetta's very romantic but is also just a great place for a one-of-a-kind Italian meal. 

We started out with sharing a glass of Pinot Noir, which was delicious and smooth. For an appetizer, I highly recommend the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms...then you must dip the bread they give you into the mushroom mixture. Deliciouso! I ordered the simple, but unforgettable Tomato and Basil Spaghetti and my boyfriend ordered the Short Rib Agnolotti, which he devoured. All their pasta is made fresh at the restaurant and can't be compared to any other pasta I've had. You must try it for yourself!

Reservations can be made online, and I definitely recommend this to anyone who is visiting Las Vegas with their significant other or wants to make a good first impression :)"}
{"text":"I visited Scarpetta Saturday, June 4th at about 8pm to 10pm. When you first look at the entrance to Scarpetta all it looks like is a long narrow hallway from a distance, but it is so much more. The restaurant opens up to an \"L\" and overlooks the Bellagio fountains. It really is a breathtaking spot and the atmosphere is to die for. Besides visiting the pools view of the strip, this restaurant has to have the best view of the fountains. When i arrived at the restaurant it was very busy so we sat at the bar. The bar is a great room of lights, atmosphere, and helpful people. While staying there we had many custom cocktails (Scarpetta creations) that the bartenders made that were delicious. We also enjoyed the bread, which they said came for D.O.C.G., which was fabulous. The bread was homemade and there were several different types, all of them great flavors. We ate their spaghetti and their ravioli, both were excelt. The cost of the meal and drinks was around $100. It was a little more than i usually spend, but when you buys drinks it can become alot more. I thought for the spot it was at, the food quality, and the atmosphere the price was right on. I would highly recommend this place, and if you already had a meal and just relax there with some of their drinks."}
{"text":"(1st review of 2013!)

My goodness, Scott Conant - you gave us THE best meal in Vegas, EVER!

Located in the new Cosmopolitan Hotel, Scarpetta's chic, dark, ambience welcomes you and your party (I observed some ranging from business meetings to bachelorette parties and everything in between, with different types of seating arrangements to  match) and the vibe was always cool and collected. The service felt disconnected - I would've removed 1 star because of that, but the food was so superb that I won't! We didn't have reservations because it was a last minute decision to dine there, but we were seated right away regardless.

We skipped appetizers and went straight for the entrees. My eyes went straight to the DUCK & FOIS GRAS RAVIOLI! My heart jumped for joy realizing that fois gras is completely legal to sell here! I ordered it and it was the right decision! The pasta was cooked perfectly and the savory filling had a creamy texture that was bursting with flavor. It was like the perfect marriage of poultry and red meat flavor. Definitely unforgettable! My husband enjoyed his TAGLIATELLE (with fall vegetables, truffle zabaglione & guanciale) - it was very comforting and hearty.

We were full, but were able to make room for dessert: NUTELLA AND VANILLA CREME BOMBOLONI which consisted of Nutella ganache, caramalized bananas & Nutella powder. WOW! The bomboloni (like donut holes) were lovely fluffy and crispy, filled with either chocolate or vanilla cream. The bananas were fantastic, as were the ganache and powder, adding decadent levels of texture.

So glad our impromptu evening of dining led us to Scarpetta. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"I was honestly really disappointed with this place. I had high hopes. It was myself and 6 other girls for a Bachelorette dinner. Felt like the server thought he was better than us. The dishes really failed to impress me. I ordered the Halibut and felt like all it really needed was a dash of salt and lemon to really pick up the taste. One of the girls ordered extra marinara or something for her calamari, so I put that on my fish and it gave it the flavor it NEEDED. The bachelorette had the Polenta as an appetizer, which she loved. But overall, we were not impressed with this place or the dishes. And come on, $24 for spaghetti!? Even if I made it from scratch, it'd cost less than $10. Just sayin'"}
{"text":"Had the signature spaghetti and meatballs. This was an OK meal... meatballs were small and tasteless- a bit hard as if they had been cooked hours earlier. Sauce was nothing special. Nice homemade noodles. Not worth $ 32. Mixed greens salad with beets was a basic salad. Decent flavor but, again, not worth $ 16. All in, for spaghetti and meatballs, mixed green salad and glass of house wine, our bill for 2 people was $ 170. I live in LA so I'm used to paying a lot to eat out, but this meal wasn't worth it. Too many other great places to eat in Vegas. (Bread was delicious!)."}
{"text":"The food was average- nothing more or less. Pretty good service. Exceptional breads. Expensive."}
{"text":"A lovely dining experience! Very attentive service and great ambiance (we had a window seat overlooking the Bellagio fountain). The best part of our meal were the appetizers- we had the butter poached lobster chestnut and parsnip soup and the creamy polenta. The flavours on both soup and polenta were amazing. The lobster was cooked perfectly and I love the toasted almonds in there. The polenta was so smooth and the truffle flavour was present but not overwhelming.  We also really enjoyed the complimentary breads and tapenade. One of the best tapenade I have ever had. Perfect with the bread. 
Entree is where they loose one star. My husband and I shared a veggie tagliatelli. The noodle was cooked perfect but the sauce was too salty. We also had 3 sides- mushroom medley, cauliflowers and butternut squash. The squash was too sweet and could have been roasted a bit more. The raisin and pine nuts in the cauliflower had a clash of flavours. The mushrooms were good but nothing too special. I was expecting something a little outside of the box than just sautéed mushrooms. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Do not go in with high expectations. If you do end up here, try to go with their more classic dishes, as they do feature a lot of non-traditional pastas like foie gras ravioli. The intention is good but ours was off on the spices and a little disappointing. One perk though, was their gourmet bread basket with tasty dipping sauces."}
{"text":"Wine & appetizers at bar. Very good wine list with knowledgable bartenders (because I dont know my Italian wines). Yummy apps. Can't wait to come back & dine in main room with its gorgeous strip views. Scott, I love u."}
{"text":"Pricy but good food. Had a great dinning experience here. Food was delicious. A good place for a fancy night."}
{"text":"The absolute best Italian food I have ever had! The flavors were unique and fresh. The bread was unbelievable. We ordered PICI and were astonished by the flavor. Fantastic atmosphere, attentive service, and extraordinary desserts. Panda ending"}
{"text":"Great place will Definitely go back. Had the grilled octopus appetizer. Had to be the best octopus Ive had. For dinner ordered the salmon omg it was mouth watering and my other half ordered the lobster pasta. Off the hook. 5 stars"}
{"text":"4 thumbs up!   What a great place to have a romantic dinner!    The wait staff was very knowledgeable regarding all the items on the menu.  Portions are a bit small, so I suggest ordering a few items for each course and sharing.  The octopus app is a good starter, all the pastas were made fresh in house and tasted amazing!"}
{"text":"Had our tiny rehearsal dinner here in the private room with a lovely view of the Bellagio fountains. Everyone I interacted with prior to dining and throughout our actual dinner was extremely kind and accomodating. Our menu was selected in advance and consisted of 4 spectacular courses all served family style except for the entrees: small shared plates (scallops, shortribs, apple endive blue cheese salad), 3 pastas (short rib bone marrow agnolotti, and another raviloi I forgot about bc I was drooling over the agnolotti), entrees (organic chicken, black cod, or ny strip steak) and dessert was these nutella filled doughnut holes rolled in sugar w/ a side of banana gelato, chocolate cake and cheesecake. Everything was delicious but if I had to pick one of each it'd be the short rib appetizer, the short rib bone marrow agnolotti, the chicken and the nutella balls. Go here if you have the opportunity!!"}
{"text":"Things that come to mind about Scarpetta Vegas- Flawless, immaculate, delicious and mind blowing.  Service was absolutely amazing- our waiter was extremely knowledgably about the food and wine selection and made the dining experience quite enjoyable.   Food was literally out of this world.  Fresh, beautifully cooked and flavorful pasta dishes, creative and inspirable appetizers and mouthwatering jaw dropping desserts.  I am not even going to go into details about which appetizers were the best and which entrees rocked my world because honestly no matter what you chose you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"want to make it clear that this review is based on two things.  the food; and what I feel is arguably just as important if not more; proper billing/customer service.

let me start off with saying that the food is great.  I had the duck/foie gras ravioli and my wife had the New York strip steak, absolutely no complaints and the service while IN the restaurant was solid.  Paid the bill with a card (lets say it was for $200.51) and went home to the kids.  This was on 2/27...

a couple of days later I viewed by bank transactions and I see that on 2/28 I was charged 2 additional times for equal amounts (let's say they were both for $140.51).  I liked the food but I didn't like it that much to go 3 times within one weekend.  we're a middle class family who doesn't have that kind of income to justify that kind of spending.

so naturally I called my bank to dispute the charges and I called the restaurant since apparently they have to be on the phone to corroborate my story and fix the problem.  Since the restaurant is closed in the daytime I elected to leave a vm.  A few hours later I did receive a return call from someone who seemed genuinely apologetic and she said that the night manager would have to be the one who can truly solve the issue.  she asked if I could be patient and wait a few hours until they can get back to me....this was on 2/29

Today is 3/9, it's now been a week and two days later and I'm still waiting for that night manager to call.  I left a second voicemail today on the same line and my family is short roughly $280 in our checking acct.  so I had to call my bank again and explain how I still haven't gotten a call back and they did tell me that once my monthly transactions clear I should be able to dispute the charges and possibly get my money back next month.

if you're looking to go out for a nice dinner with your spouse/significant other I would think twice before going to a restaurant whose service level goes down to 0 once they have your money"}
{"text":"Since we were staying at the cosmopolitan my husband and I decided to go back to Scarpetta. This visit did not disappoint. We started with the lobster and grilled peach salad with burratta. It was just over-the-top delicious. I ordered their signature spaghetti which was absolute perfection.  My has been was still dreaming about the last time he ordered a fillet there so he ordered it again and it was absolutely amazing. Service was fantastic as well. The bread basket and the top and nod and butter that they bring with it are just as amazing. If you are nearby or staying at the cosmopolitan in Las Vegas you must try this beautiful restaurant. They also have a great bar where you enjoy a glass of wine and an appetizer. We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Graciously hosted by Gina(chef), Domenic(Somm), Mario, and Noe this was the best dining experience ever.  Evening started out with there combination meat and cheese......fresh Parmigiano reminiscent of my trip to Parma, salty, nutty, and firm.    Now, for those who know me, I take 'Sauce' seriously as I was raised by a full blooded Sicilian mother.  I'm excited to say they Sauce was bright with acid, rounded out with olive oil and basil and finished with a hit of butter.  The polpettino were delicate pillow of lamb, beef, and pork with a nice crust gently tossed into the sauce.   Wines were perfectly selected by Noe and Domenic.  Should you get a chance reserve the private room for an intimate view of vegas.

Thank you to Noe and team for the memorable experience.  See you all at CES in January."}
{"text":"I was part of a large group that had lunch here.  The place is very elegant.  Staff was professional and friendly. The view is terrific.

The food was excellent.  Appetizers, meal and dessert were exceptional. We were able to sample several of each and all were delicious.

Highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"The first sign should have been that only two tables were occupied at prime dinner time. Even though nearly every table was empty, we got sat in the back, despite every window seat being available, we got sat nearly two tables back.

The food was mediocre at best. I had the goat cheese ravioli and was bland at best. Was covered in some foamy like topping that tasted like soap.

The bread was good but wasn't served into nearly 30 minutes in.

Considering how empty they were, you would have expected service to be better but definitely could have used improvement.

Overall, definitely not worth the cost. I don't mind paying for good service and a good meal but this was not that."}
{"text":"This was the best meal I had this visit to Las Vegas! I was just in town a month prior and did some research about where to get good Italian food this time. Based on yelp, I was all set to get the spaghetti. But, based on my waiter's suggestion, I went with the short rib agnolotti and my mother got the tagliatelle with lamb bolognese. Our meals were good (hers more than mine) but I just didn't feel satisfied. So we ordered a third meal to share of the spaghetti. And WOW!!!!! It was the most basic, flavorful, al dente pasta I've ever had.  The basil came through every bite and the sauce was so smooth yet complex. Sometimes simple really is best.  I think about this spaghetti at least once a day and will definitely make a point to get it (maybe even twice) the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary with a romantic date night here.   The food and the service were both fantastic; however, we both were plagued with food poisoning that evening.  My episode kicked in about 2 hours after dinner and he was up all night super sick.  

My disappointment doesn't lie in the fact that we were displeased with our meal or the service, but rather in the service I received the next morning when I called to let them know about our food poisoning.  The manager on the phone immediately became defensive instead of apologetic and told me that food poisoning does not kick in until 8 hours later and that it was probably something else we had eaten during the day.  Mind you... this was the only meal and time that my boyfriend had spent together all day.   I had also called only 30 minutes after they had opened for the evening and she told me that it couldn't have been the food because they didn't receive any other calls regarding any episodes of food poisoning and we ordered popular items on the menu.  (Braised short rib, chicken, and a pasta dish). I still can't believe that I had to justify our ill feelings with someone who showed no compassion and was challenging me on the authenticity of my statement.

She eventually transferred me to security to fill out a report.  Four days later im still waiting to hear back regarding some sort of follow up.  

Never going here again."}
{"text":"The best I've had in Vegas!! Everything was amazing, we had the tasting menu which for the value was one of the best in Vegas!  The flower and Tabasco cocktail was awesome and then thank god  the server guided us away from more cocktails and towards the amazing wine pairings!  It was from start to finish one of the best meals I've ever had"}
{"text":"Great Italian food in an even better setting.  View of the strip while dining on indulgent pasta?  Yes, please.  The bread they serve before dinner is worth it alone haha. You just can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal here. The scallops appetizer was excellent thanks to the squash bed and accessory toppings. The Veal Loin was about as perfect as humanly possible. The Nutella Bombs were a nice sweet finish. All was helped by a polished professional waiter."}
{"text":"The restaurant is gorgeous with views of the fountains and a classy cool atmosphere. The food was impeccable, and the staff was top shelf. The menu can be pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here and really enjoyed the experience.  While we weren't seated near the window, we could still see the fountain and a lot of the view of the strip. The staff was friendly and accommodating and the food was delicious.  I highly recommend the foie gras ravioli, and any of the house made pasta for that matter.  One recommendation would be to make reservations as early as possible as the restaurant appears to be very popular and is relatively small."}
{"text":"High end, classy dining. Good foods, great service. Expensive and small portions (as one would expect honestly). Great Italian wine selection"}
{"text":"Amazing food, and ambience. The restaurant is very elegant, and was very quiet during our visit. The service was awesome. Highly recommend the duck breast. The mascarpone cheesecake might be the most delicious thing I have ever eaten. We're going to go back just for that."}
{"text":"Romantic, classy, with a great view of the Bellagio fountains. It's located in the new Cosmopolitan hotel. Service was impeccable and food was innovative and had very distinctive flavors. Their free bread basket is so good - had to resist the urge to ask for another basket before the meal. I wasn't the biggest fan of the short rib and bone marrow starter or the duck and foie gras ravioli (it was good but maybe I just don't have the taste for it), but their diver scallops and polenta with mushrooms were amazing! Overall they pasta main courses were fine, but didn't blow us away. The black cod entree was a small portion but delicious. The atmosphere and experience of a nice Vegas restaurant with relatively reasonably priced (by Vegas standards) with several chances to catch the fountain shows... That's what gets you!"}
{"text":"Perfectly romantic restaurant overlooking the Bellagio fountains and strip if you're seated near the window as we were.

Menu had great variety which made choosing pretty difficult. Fortunately there was a fantastic bread basket with 3 types that kept us going.

Drinks we got the Gallardo and San Remo. Gallardo was a nice appletini-ish drink and the San Remo was delicious.

We shared 3 dishes: the tuna+avocado and yellowtail to start. The tuna dish was more or less as expected with great quality fish and a nice garnish, also plentiful. The yellowtail came with 4 or 5 paper thin slices, also as expected served with a very subtle ginger/salt sauce. I was a little dissapointed with this given the quantity and quality.

We shared the branzino as an entree, which was incredible and served in a killer shellfish broth with small pieces of lobster, mussels, and potato. 

Service was definitely a little slow for our table (others were being served quicker) but we weren't in a rush so it wasn't a big deal. 

Overall, 4/5 stars based on what we ordered for the price and the service, could easily be 5/5 based on other items so I'll return to try it out in the future."}
{"text":"12/29/15 dinner for 6 at 6:00pm. Solid 4 stars, would of been 5 but service was poor and I felt we were treated differently because we are young couples and not old rich people. 
3 couples, sat right away in a large circular booth that only fit 5. One member of our party had to sit in a chair. He missed the fountain show and blocked others. I guess the can't accommodate a party of 6. Service was poor, had to ask for water, ask about specials, had to ask about the menu and it just felt like we weren't good enough for the wait staff? Anyway, if someone from the restaurant ever reads this you should put more effort into training your staff to treat everyone the same and work on service recovery! 

Okay food: it was amazing! I tried all 6 meals and both apps. Everything was amazing! To bad the staff wasn't amazing."}
{"text":"Disappointing; Three of us for dinner with drinks. 

The Pinot Grigio house wine was very good. We started with the Misto salad.  It had a nice assortment of tender greens, a wee bit of buffalo mozzarella but the only dressing on it was olive oil.  It needed a little pizzaz like lemon or vinegar, herbs, garlic or mustard....anything more than olive oil. For $15 I expect some flavour. I ordered the Linguini Pescatore;  a very small portion that offered 3 types of seafood:  squid, shrimp and clams.  The squid was almost non existent, 3 tiny clams and two nice quality shrimp. It was swimming in too much sauce that was too acidic - like tomato paste.  I didn't like it. My husband had the lasagna, he said it was ok but felt the portion was too small. My cousin had the pizza which had good flavour but it was too thin with a sauce that was too thin.  This created a soggy mess - too bad as it's easy to correct.  Just quality control.  The water refills were only offered at the time of payment. We all agreed we wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Really nice place for dinner. I was sad about not having the opportunity to dine at Scarpetta in LA before it closed so I decided to try out the one in Vegas. We were with a group of 8. Most of us got pasta and two people got steak. Everyone loved their food. I got the spaghetti and loved it. My friends got the Pici and loved that as well. I also liked the assortment of bread. The restaurant has a really nice vibe and offers pretty nice views. Four stars instead of five for the following reasons: 1) two of their drinks were not good at all and we had asked the waiter ahead of time if they were sweet, were reassured that they weren't 2) even though we sent one of the drinks back because it was just so gross we didn't get an apology, an offer to replace, or a comp. I expect better attention to detail when we're spending almost $700 on dinner. Other than that, everything was great. A nice addition to the great restaurants at Cosmopolitan."}
{"text":"3 - appetizers - Creamy Polenta (perfect flavor, slightly thin), Tomato and Mozzarella, Braised Beef (both small, but excellent).

2 - pastas - a beautiful mini-ravioli excellently sauced and thick noodle in tomato sauce that was less successful (too thick and chewy).

Entres were OK, but the staff confused who got what.  My filet of beef was undercooked and uneventful.

Desserts - flour-less chocolate was ok, otherwise, unmemorable.

Very nice dining room (some get beautiful views of the Bellagio Fountain).

Service was adequate."}
{"text":"I was planning my friend's bachelorette party in Vegas and she wanted to do one fancy shmancy dinner.  I had two restaurants in mind and when she told me she wanted Italian, Scarpetta was the way to go.  I requested a table by the window so we can see the Bellagio water show.  The hostess said it was not guaranteed, but they will try their best to accommodate.  When we arrived at the restaurant, we were led into a private room with the view we requested.  I really couldn't have been any happier.  SIKE!  The food was effing amazing.  I was afraid some of the girls wouldn't eat (picky eaters), but everyone enjoyed their meal.  I ordered the veal chop ($68).  No regrets there though because I practically licked my plate after.  It was so juicy.  Normally, I don't like any pieces of fat.  I will literally gag at the table and throw up right then and there, but it melted in my mouth.  It was like a clean fat.  I honestly don't know how to describe it.  Ohmygawd.  We ended our dinner with dessert.  I was not disappointed in any of our choices.  

Don't forget that bread basket at the beginning!  I think we asked for two refills.  Another great thing about this place is that they make their pasts in house."}
{"text":"I must admit, my expectations were somewhat low for Scarpetta, as I usually find the Las Vegas outposts of famous restaurants to be more about decor and overpriced menus, and less about food.  I was glad to be proven wrong.

Although Scarpetta definitely delivers in the \"Las Vegas Hip\" decor, with a gorgeous dining room that has a glass-enclosed wine cellar on one wall, and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Bellagio fountains on the other, it also delivers on the food front.

At the waiters recommendation, my group of three decided to share a Primi (app) and Pasta, and order our own entrees.  Before our first course came out, we were brought fresh bread basket which I can honestly say was the BEST bread I've ever had.  A mix of rosemary ciabatta, focaccia, and this to-die-for bread that had salami and mozzarella in it.  The accompaniments of Olive Oil, Eggplant spread, and Mascarpone Butter were equally satisfying.  Here is a by-dish review:

Heirloom tomato salad w/ stracciatella, salsa verde & marinated eggplant:  This dish was good, if not a bit common.  It seems so many restaurants have an heirloom tomtato & burrata dish, that if you've had one, you've had them all - although I was happy to learn that stracciatella is an equally awesome burrata-style cheese.

Creamy polenta w/ fricassee of truffled mushrooms: Hands down the best polenta anyone at our table had ever had.  It was so creamy and rich, and went great with the mushrooms which were served from a separate pot.

Duck & Foie Gras ravioli w/ marsala reduction:  This dish was very well received by the two people in my party who'd never had foie gras.  I am a huge fan of foie, and found the dish to be lacking the richness that usually comes when it's served on it's own - but overall a great dish.

Pancetta-wrapped Veal Loin w/ sweetbreads, peas & carrots: The veal loin was my favorite dish of the night.  I am used to having sweetbreads battered and fried, so it was interesting to have them in a more natural state - small chunks cooked and mixed in with the vegetables.

Zeppole w/ nutella center, vanilla sauce & candied hazelnuts: WOW - we were blown away by how good this dessert was.  Little chocolate donut holes filled with nutella - YUM.

I will say that their wine list leans towards the expensive side, with only a few bottles in the $60 - $70 range.  We ordered the Castello di Bossi Chianti Classcio Riserva Berardo, which was $105 (retails for $30) - a good wine, but a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Had the spaghetti, and it was delicious. Definitely better than spaghetti I've had elsewhere, but not the best (The best was at Marea in NY). Like another person said, the consistency of the noodles was exactly like Chinese hand-pulled noodles I had growing up. The sauce was incredible. Had a bit of fire, although most people would not notice unless they were looking."}
{"text":"Wow - an unsurpassed experience.  The food was amazing ; make sure you order the charcuterie board,  The Tagliatelle with 5 kinds of wild mushrooms, the rib eye to share and the chocolate mousse cake for dessert.  The 'If You See Kay' bottle of wine @ $60 / bottle is amazing. We had Roger as our waiter and I can't even begin to explain as to how awesome he was.  Also, band on Saturday eve was amazing; great choice (I bought CD!)"}
{"text":"I was in here on Saturday night with friends.  The place was busier than  I expected and had a good vibe.   Unfortunately the service wasnt good and the food was quite average. 
Our server was friendly, but kept forgetting things, and had this \"cool man\"  kind of attitude like we were all best buddies. This would be fine if the service was good - but when the service is bad, it just gets frustrating and annoying. 
We ordered the olives to start which were pretty basic - mostly green olives with some sundried black ones on top - they were heated? and I could taste bits of fennel seed, which I liked. 
 My main was a basic pasta and tomato sauce - I asked for spaghetti and so did someone else in our group of 9.  When it arrived, there was a huge difference in the plating, I had a small portion and my friend had a big one -consistency would be great. 
Another person at the table ordered a different penne pasta and the portion was massive... what is the rhyme and reason of portion control and perceived value?
The gnocchi that arrived were perfectly uniform -and although my pasta tasted fresh, the uniform size of the gnocchi made people question if they were store bought.  All of our entrees arrived except one - a lasagna and we all sat with our food in front of us waiting for this last dish to arrive. About 8 minutes later it did.  No apology from the server. Someone else dropped it off, and again no apology. 
When the bills arrived - some people were overcharged, others undercharged( we corrected him) and it was all just a gong show. 
Did we have a good time? More or less, would I go back - never."}
{"text":"The chicken was super good. Complimentary bread. Portions are very small. Very nice restaurant.  I was very disappointed in the short rib w/ risotto though.  It was about $30 for 2 thin slices of beef & a scoop of rice."}
{"text":"We've been to Scarpetta's every year for the last 3 years. We've made sure to go every time we are in Vegas. We were just there for my birthday last week, and it's the same experience everytime. Stellar. The food is wonderful, the view is gorgeous, and the staff is courteous, and prompt. We look forward to dinner here every year."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a long time....appropriately priced and amazing quality. The ambiance is amazing and the staff there is impeccably trained. Even the bread (with the variety of spreads) will knock your socks off. Just make sure to save room for the actual entrees...

The duck and foie gras ravioli is their signature dish and reasonably so. It's amazing. Delicate and refined is probably the best way to describe it. 

Colorado Lamb was amazing. The lamb was not gamey at all and the different components of the dish worked in harmony. I will admit that I still like the Colorado Lamb from Stage restaurant in Honolulu...

I remember one of my friends having a really delicious pasta (mint infused?) but I can't remember all the details regarding it. I just remembered it was heavenly. 

Strawberry souffle was amazing. Light, aromatic, and slightly sweet. It blew my socks off and definitely put Maison Akira's souffle to shame. 

Zeppole are AHH-MAYYY-ZIING. Deep fried dough nuggets (so light and airy!) filled with a rich nutella center. Even if you're full, you need to get these...or you will regret it forever. 

Definitely a great place to hit up for a bite to eat when you're in Vegas. I definitely will be returning during my next trip!"}
{"text":"We love love love this restaurant. It is one of our most favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. We loving dressing up to come here and the View Is out of control amazing!!! They are always extraordinarily helpful and cautious when it come to my food allergies and the fact that I am vegan. The whole staff is awesome here. I would defiantly recommend them, and I will defiantly return!!"}
{"text":"I just love this place! I have to write another review and tell everybody how great it is!

We came here to celebrate two birthdays the other day and the service, like last time, was awesome. Everybody thoroughly enjoyed their food and had ZERO complaints! We had a party of 8 and there were a few picky eaters amongst us and seriously everybody LOVED their food! I ordered the scallop with foie gras for an appetizer, lamb for the main course, and this guava soup thing with pineapples for dessert. Scallops were AMAZING and probably my favorite part of the whole meal. The lamb was different than the last time I had it but still good. The guava soup (per our waiter's suggestion) was light and refreshing...so good.

I whole heartedly recommend this place to everybody who wants to have a great meal and a great dining experience"}
{"text":"Visited here over Thanksgiving while staying at one of my fave hotels, The Cosmopolitan. Scott Conant's famous restaurant overlooks the Bellagio fountains if you get a window seat, and has a wonderfully romantic but classic vibe. Not too loud, not too trendy, just elegant. I started with my favorite, a burrata and heirloom tomato salad with roasted eggplant which was quite a large portion and was very fresh. It needed to be considering what I was following it up with...Duck & Foie Gras ravioli. I know. Whenever out of CA right? Homemade pasta stuffed with melt in your mouth pockets of foie gras drizzled with a barolo reduction. I'd never had anything like it and probably never will and it was truly amazing and truly rich. I started with a cocktail that I don't remember the name of, but it was a usual concoction of my favorites, gin, basil, apple juice, and something else delicious and fresh. I wish I could remember more what Tristan had...he started with a fresh soup of some kind, pureed italian pea poured over veggies and hazelnuts I believe that he went nuts for. He also had a pasta (all homemade needless to say) with a lamb ragu. I'd absolutely go if you have the opportunity."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! Our waiter David was so patient, he not only went through almost ever item on the menu but also provided great recommendations!  We had a fantastic dining experience and enjoyed every dish (we had pasta and soufflé). Definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"It was pretty dark inside but maybe you might like the extra dim lights. The spaghetti was our tables favorite. 

I ordered the chicken and asked the waiter twice if the sauce had liver in it because it says fagato on the menu and he said sometimes that sauce is made with liver but our is not. Turns out he was wrong as when the food came out I asked the guy who brought it who seemed to know the food better and he said it was made with liver. I don't like the taste of liver and the sauce was all over my plate. The servers should know their food better so that is why I'm giving it 3 stars."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The pasta was served in a covered dish that was unveiled upon arrival at the table. It was fresh, hot, full of flavor. We started with the scallops and foie gras which was my favorite dish of the night! The foie gras just melted in my mouth!  I got the pico with lobster, tarragon, and chili pesto. It was light and a little spicy, but delicious. My friend got the tagliatelle with vegetables, truffle, and guanciale. Hers was rich and even yummier than my dish! I can't wait to try this restaurant in Beverly Hills!"}
{"text":"Was here this past year for CES, and we had 2 events here.
One was our company dinner in the private room with a view of Bellagio Fountains and the other was a upper management meeting with a client over wine tasting in the private seating area which is in the kitchen.

For the wine tasting, it was pretty awesome, except the room is probably equipped to seat 8 people comfortably, maybe 10, we squeezed in 12.  We enjoyed some awesome wines and some desserts, which hey mistakenly sent to our table, so they ended up comping those and bringing more, it was very good.  

The cool thing about this private room, is that you have to walk through the kitchen to get to it and it is located next to the kitchen, with glass floor to ceiling so you can see into the kitchen as they work and cook and the background is a view of the Bellagio Fountains and the strip.  

The second occasion was for our company dinner a few nights later since they were able to accommodate our group of 16 in the private dining room that is in front of the restaurant and our big boss loves Italian food.  

Although you can order single entrees off the menu, we had our waiter set up our dinner family style with some of his recommendations and some of the things we wanted to try.  

Also, our big boss had a request for something off the menu and the chef obliged with no problems.  Keeping the boss happy is always key!

We had the following dishes.
Apps - Braised short rib of beef, Creamy polenta, Raw yellowtail and Tuna Susci
the short ribs and the polenta were my favorite, the Susci was just ok.

Entrees - Duck and Foie Gras ravioli, Short rib agnolotti, Sheep milk ricotta agnolotti.  All were awesome, but the duck and foie gras raviolli is very rich.

We had dessert, but I don't actually remember what I had.

Service was great and except the bar was slow, so they comped certain drinks that didn't show up in a time fashion.

The minus one star was for the Sommelier, who seemed to enjoy the sound of his own voice and didn't really consider the requests of the guests at the table.  I understand he is very knowledgeable and he is an expert, but he could dial back the ego and work with the guest.  

Other than that, great place, I recommend it and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and views but the food was just ok and service also not that good. I really don't think its an Italian restaurant either. The octopus was great but nothing unique or special. Had the duck breast. That was good just not great. I think the service level is just not quite there. It felt a little unfocused and we had to wait a long time just to get our plates cleared and I found myself flagging someone down more than once. Service and food really don't match the price if you ask me. I think it's mostly about ambiance. If you want to take out of towners to an Italian restaurant that is both cheaper and frankly much more satisfying food, go to buddy v's up the road."}
{"text":"Pretty phenomenal place. Let me start with the drinks. Most were on the fruity side, but they were all delicious. The main room has a window view of the Bellagio fountains, which set the mood and were going off every 15-20 minutes or so. Food was pretty good for the most part. Lady had the prix fixe and I had a few a la carte choices. The tuna app was super fresh and perfect for the evening. The celeriac soup was silky and very good. The bread is awesome. I know it sounds weird to rate the free shit, but their \"stromboli\" bread with the marscapone butter could be a meal in itself. Pumpkin ravioli was great. The filet and short rib mash was on point. The only thing that I was disappointed in was the foie/duck ravioli. It just wasn't what I thought it would be . It was good, and a rather large portion, but I expected something else. Dessert was ho-hum as well. Regardless, I would come back as the service was great and the ambiance was great."}
{"text":"A real disappointment...we own a business in Inglewood and wanted to support a fellow business in the community.  So, we decided to have our staff Christmas Party at 500 Cucina.  We talked to the manager/owner Rocco and he said he needed a deposit ($1000) in order to save our reservation for the large group we were feeding. He said it was just to hold the reservation and that we would be reimbursed the $1000. We paid our bill for the night (which was a large bill) and as it turns out he also charged our credit card $1000 which he said was only a deposit. It is 15 months later and he still has NOT reimbursed us the \"deposit\" and claims it is the banks fault. Bottom line is he is dishonest and has taken advantage of good people who were willing to give him business and support a community member, only to be ripped off."}
{"text":"Mostly Exceptional Food, Mostly Forgettable Service. 

I've been wanting to come here ever since seeing this place featured on Food Network's 'Best Thing I Ever Ate.' We came as a party of 5 to include my parents, 2 year old son and wife.

We came in and the hostess was less than friendly. She asked my name then took us to our table without a word. 

We sat down and waited much too long for our waiter. This became a theme throughout the night. He finally came by and simply told us the daily special and asked what we wanted to drink. I've been to many upscale restaurants around the world, and this would be unacceptable at any of them. He didn't take any time to explain the menu, how people normally order, etc. 

The menu was divided into courses which led me to believe people ordered many courses. However, with the price of each dish this would get prohibitively expensive quite quickly. I asked the waiter and pointed out that people ordered at most 2 dishes and that they were not family style. I'd expect the opposite with authentic Italian.

The drinks took FOREVER to come out, nearly being outpaced by our appetizers! We didn't order anything outrageous: 2 bourbons neat, 2 martinis and some milk. The bourbon list was one of the most extensive I've seen in a restaurant, mind you I just returned from 3 years in Japan. 

Our appetizers came out and were presented well. I ordered the creamy polenta into which the waiter scooped in fricasseed mushrooms. It had wonderful texture and taste; my wife hates polenta but loved it, even more than her butternut squash soup. It was ok, but had a Chinese five spice taste to it we found off putting. The bread and spreads were good and my dad enjoyed his Endive salad, despite the waiter giving it to my mom at first. Again, at this price point, unacceptable!

For the main course three of us ordered the spaghetti with tomato and basil and one got the short rib / bone marrow agnolotti. Both were mind blowing: must haves. 

Two of us got chocolate soufflé for dessert; I got the bombolonis and my mom got the panna cotta. The chocolate soufflé had that nasty five spice flavor to it again. Gross! I was certainly not a fan. The bombolonis were a can't miss as they were filled with Nutella, although the banana gelato was an awkward pairing.  The panna cotta was wonderfully fruity and refreshing. My mom got the best dessert for sure. 

I would come back here for the spaghetti, panna cotta and bourbon list, and hopefully we'd get a better waiter."}
{"text":"Great experience here! My boyfriend and I only had one night in Vegas, and we wanted to go big for dinner. We chose Scarpetta, and were so glad we did! Our waiter was very knowledgable and helpful, and the service was great. The decor was gorgeous, and had great ambiance. I would say it was very romantic with the dim lighting and lots of dark hardwood. The view was also beautiful, and we could watch Bellagio water show while we ate. 

Now onto the food...

First off, we were very impressed with the complimentary bread. One of them had spinach and smoked mozzarella baked into it! We started with the crispy fritto misto as an appetizer, which was great. It was delicious on it's own...no aioli needed! I had the Pici for my entrée. Tasted really great, but there was quite a bit of spice to it. It had a chili pesto sauce, so I should have expected it. It had a good amount of lobster in it. My boyfriend had the Tagliatelle, and we both decided that was the winner. The creamy truffle zabaglione sauce was to die for! The fresh vegetables and pancetta mixed in made it not overly rich as well. The pastas are made fresh there, and we could definitely taste the quality! We each had a glass of a nice Pinot Noir to enjoy with our pastas. 

It was a little pricy, but the quality is just so great and overall experience made it so worth it! There are so many great restaurants to try in Vegas, but I know I will be back to Scarpetta. Definitely one of my top dining experiences!"}
{"text":"Where to start? 
Service... almost impeccable! 
Wine selection, even by the glass, incredible!
The food? Maybe better than being in Italy! We started with the Soft Polenta & Truffle! No words can describe this creation. Then the Burrata salad came out, very nice, yet he watermelon cubes were not for us. For the main course we shared the Kobe Cap, OMG! The Pici Pasta, a true creation from God! And the traditional Spaghetti, a masterpiece in simplicity! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  Really superb.  I enjoyed a lovely glass of cabernet as I waited for my  short rib agnolotti.  I was staying at the Cosmo and wanted to dine on my balcony, so I ordered carry out.  This meal was absolutely amazing...delicate and flavorful pasta, served with a selection of delicious breads.  I cannot wait to visit again to enjoy this lovely meal."}
{"text":"Ate there in March for a birthday celebration and was NOT disappointed.  This place is great and highly recommended.

The ambience is great. You do walk through a rather long narrow bar area, but when you get to the main dining area, you will be impressed. Great views of the strip.  We were seated in a very private booth with floor to ceiling \"booth\" - it was intimate and allowed the 6 of us to really talk.  

The service - attentive.  Not overbearing, not pushing (i..e we weren't that hungry and didn't order apps).  The breadbasket - yummy!!!!! 

Several tried the black cod - delicous!! I had the duck - it was wonderful and cooked just right.  Portions are on the smaller side, so if you are hungry make certain you order an appetizer.  The entrees were mostly in the $30 range, though some a bit cheaper.

They brought a lovely molten chocolate lava cake thing for the birthday boy, which was really tasty.

The wine list is huge! Not cheap, but some good selections.

Overall - certainly a place I would return."}
{"text":"Hold up. WHY does Scarpetta only have 4 stars? This was easily the best meal I had in Vegas, and quite possibly the best Italian I've had outside of my study abroad experience in Florence, Italy. It's got the perfect dining ambiance (perfect for a date with a significant other, or if you're me... your mom) with a view to boot (we watched the Bellagio fountains go off all night)!

Our waiter was absolutely adorable and I don't know how they managed to crank out their food so fast, but we were in and out within an hour. I wasn't really in the mood for anything heavy, but I'm a sucker for carbs and a good pasta dish, so I went with the short rib agnolotti, and my mom had the tagliatelle. Hoooly mother of all that is savory and delicious! The portions seem small, but man that plate of pasta will fill you up just right, while saving JUST enough room for that nutella and vanilla bombolini dessert, which I HIGHLY recommend. In fact, I wasn't even quick enough to snap a pic of this delicacy for Yelping purposes prior to absolutely devouring it, so you KNOW it was good.

The night definitely wasn't our cheapest meal in Vegas by any means, but it was definitely worth the splurge."}
{"text":"Food and service - Perfect , delicious , but the bathrooms , not so much ! I will definitely go back as the menu is amazing and it wasn't too loud as some of these places can be."}
{"text":"I had a group dinner here last weekend. From the start to the end, the manager and staff at the restaurant were very accommodating and attentive. The manager, Kelli, was very helpful on setting up a family style dinner and was amazing to work with. The food was delicious and the portions were very generous for a family style meal. We had 3 of their staff attending to our table. They even accommodated one of the guests who had celiac disease at the last minute! We had an amazing time here and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The hallmarks of an elite Las Vegas restaurant are outstanding food, personable service, and a great atmosphere. If a restaurant can hit on all three of these, and do so at a reasonable price, they deserve a fifth star. Scarpetta doesn't even belong in the same sentence as some of the amazing Vegas hotspots. Lets start with the good- Scarpetta has a nice location with a good view of the strip and prides itself on a swanky and sleek atmosphere. Its dark, the jazzy music is loud, and the table settings a slick. The other \"views\" are good too- as the younger crowd will probably afford you a few peaks at some match.com dates happening around you. Your jaw will even drop as soon as you see the cans on the hostess, but its all downhill after that at Scarpetta.

To start, the restaurant was a hot box, so bring a wet towel to cool off. The service was atrociously impersonal and inattentive. Great restaurants have teams of servers constantly working your table, making suggestions, and guiding you through the experience. We had no sommelier to talk about wines with. Our waiter was a smug and unsmiling grump who detracted even more from the average food. The pasta dishes we ordered were step above Barilla pasta with some canned Ragu sauce. The beef tar tar was tasteless. How could some many be so wrong about this place? OVER-RATED! Clap, clap. Clap, Clap, Clap. If you want overpriced, average food with a forgettable personal touch slathered all over your plate- hit Scarpetta. If you want to enjoy a meal- look elsewhere."}
{"text":"5 star! We were in Vegas celebrating a bachelorette party this past weekend and I made reservations for Scarpetta at Cosmo.  It is one of my favorite places in LA and I figured I couldn't go wrong at their Las Vegas location.  They exceeded expectations.  I made reservations for 7 on opentable and due to a very long taxi line at our hotel we were running a bit late, I called them and they were kind to let me know that they would seat us when we arrive and not to worry.  Dinner was remarkable per usual as was the excellent service.  They were aware of our celebration and the staff made sure to congratulate our bride personally and with a desert! The waiter and his crew were extremely friendly and before we knew it 2 hrs had passed us by and we left happy and very full. I cant wait to go back!

What we ordered:
Farmer's Market Salad
Crispy Fritto Misto 
Creamy Polenta - AMAZING
Roasted Diver Scallops
Braised Short Ribs of Beef
Spaghetti - 4 out of 7 of us ordered this dish and all of us finished the entire bowl
Fettuccine  - If youre going to order the pasta dont be foolish order SPAGHETTI
Prime Filet of Beef - amazing!

The drinks were also delicious! The lemon drop martini and shots especially."}
{"text":"I've been here twice already on my trips to Vegas and enjoyed my meal both times. We called the day of each time and were able to get a reservation for the same night! Scarpetta is located on the 3rd floor of cosmo and offers a great view of the water show on the strip! 

They have a changing menu and amazing bread basket that comes with each meal! The bread is so good, I actually found myself most excited for their assorted focaccia, ciabatta, and sourdoughs that are served with lemon olive oil, an eggplant dip, and marscarpone butter. 

We had the:
Risotto with summer truffles: 5/5 this dish was amazing!! We ordered this as an appetizer to share but after one bite I wished I had ordered one just for myself 
Duck and foie gras ravioli: overly salty and didn't have as much foie as I had hoped
Short rib agnolotti: 5/5 favorite pasta dish of the night!
Tagliatelle with lamb bolognese and truffle burrata: 5/5
Black calamarata: 4/5 didn't have as much uni as we hoped for but still good

Overall, the food was great and service was amazing and I'll definitely be dreaming of that truffle risotto until our next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Scott Conant's Scarpetta boasts lavish, dimly lit and woody decor, complete with a view overlooking the Bellagio fountains from the Cosmopolitan. Be sure to make a reservation and if there are only 2 of you dining, request to sit by the window. All of the staff are well-trained and highly professional, delivering an upscale dining experience from start to finish. 

My sister and I came for a quick dinner before the club and didn't want to get too full, so we only indulged in the starter bread and 1 entree each. The bread basket is exquisite and features 1 piece each of Sourdough, Ciabbata, a salami Stromboli, broccoli Stromboli, and another that I cannot remember. It is accompanied by a white wine olive oil, mascarpone butter, and some type of tapenade. 

I ordered the famous Spaghetti. As far as I know, this dish only contains 3 ingredients. Noodles, tomato sauce, basil. Yes, the noodles were a perfect al-dente with just a little bite to them. Yes the sauce was fresh and light, sticking to each noodle. Was this worth $24? No. For only $2 more (and more deserving of the price tag), my sister went with the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli. The ravioli was optimally thin and there was almost no sauce, making the meat the star. It was a rich dish and could easily be shared if you're also getting an appetizer.   

I'm happy to have had my Scarpetta experience and I enjoyed the food and the ambiance, but I don't see any need to come back here for the $24 spaghetti, which is why I settled on 4 stars."}
{"text":"For years, I've always felt that -- among the casinos -- the MGM Grand has the best restaurants.  This may be changing, and Scarpetta is *certainly* one of the biggest reasons why.  

Lynn and I followed up our \"good\" dinner Wednesday night at Comme Ça (also Yelped) with dinner at Scarpetta the next night (followed Friday night by LoS, but that's been written up way to many times).  

Being a Celebrity Chef is a double-edged sword . . . it certainly gets your name out there, but then you (typically) aren't there to defend it -- someone ELSE is in the kitchen is, but if it sucks, you get the blame.  A potentially dicey proposition at best.

Scott Conant need not worry; his Vegas outpost is in excellent hands.

The six of us began with a bottle of n.v. Champagne from Chartogne-Taillet (Cuvée Ste.-Anne), and ordered a round of appetizers \"for the table.\"  (The table, too, apparently was hungry -- not just the six of us!)  

Finishing the Champagne just as the appetizers arrived, we moved into a 2008 Bruno Giacosa Arneis.  We enjoyed the yellowtail crudo, the creamy polenta with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms (the winner of this round, IMHO), and the roasted sea scallops with porcini and sunchokes . . . all were delightful!

VEGETARIAN ALERT:  this place is *very* cool, and vegetarian-friendly.  They have a totally separate vegetarian and vegan menu available for the asking (as one in our party did).

Moving into the pasta course, we had the spaghetti with tomato and basil (so simple to say, so profound to eat -- nothing can describe the layers of flavor that you get here; magnificent!), the duck & foie gras ravioli with marsala reduction (OK, this is to die for!), and the short rib agnolotti with with brown butter horseradish.  Of course, we also moved into a stunning Piedmontese red, the 1999 Barbaesco Riserva Vigneti in Ovello from the  Produttori del Barbaresco.  Just gorgeous!

Our entrées included black cod with caramelized fennel & concentrated tomato, sirloin with potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms, parmigiano & barolo ragu, a veal chop the size of Baltimore (and much more tasty), and the aforementioned spaghetti with tomato and basil (as an entrée portion).  

A little dessert, a little Porto and coffee, and the world is a perfect place!

P.S. In case you haven't figured it out yet, their wine list is not only incredible, but there are some true gems on this list that remain real bargains (if you know how/where to look)."}
{"text":"On Saturday night we were invited to Scarpetta  for dinner by an old friend. We had dinner reservations at 8:30 pm and it was hard getting into the Cosmopolitan Hotel because of all the traffic. We got seated right next to the window overlooking the Bellagio Fountain. The menu is very simple. We had the following:

Softshell crabs             3/5 stars the crabs were extra large. Deep fried and kinda
                                                         greasy.
Polenta                           5/5 stars off the hook good. excellent must order!

Heirloom Tomato Salad 4/5  stars   good fresh and dressed well.

Yellowtail sashimi           4/5  stars   4 small thinly slices pieces. Normal sushi fare.

Duck Foie Gras Ravioli     4/5 stars OK not the gastronomic orgasm as other yelpers
                                                              mentioned
Spaghetti                           4/5 stars excellent al dente, 

Barzano Fish                     5/5 stars best entree' of the night well cooked.

Cheese cake                     4/5 stars OK small poker chip sized.

Strawberry Souffle'           5/5 stars AMAZING ! light great strawberry flavor with a
                                                              dollop of vanilla ice cream. 

If you can get a seat next to the window over looking the Bellagio Fountain and the Las Vegas Strip the meal is well worth the prices. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"simple elegant food. I would recommend this place to the most discerning of palates! The scallop was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The Spaghetti was simple but addicting! The short agnolotti was super flavorful and the Tagliatelle with root veggies was absolutely devine!"}
{"text":"So so so good! We started out with the bread basket and Polenta. The bread was delicious- I almost filled up on just that! The polenta was different for me, but I am happy I tried it. For our main courses we tried the pork chop, veal chop, duck breast, and spaghetti. I can't stop talking about the pork chop! So much flavor! Definitely my favorite out of the four dishes. The spaghetti is such a simple dish- but a classic and they made it perfectly. The veal was very tender and my husband loved it. I think out of the four dishes, the duck was everyone's least favorite. We HAD to try dessert so we went with the cheesecake and chocolate cake- both amazing. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly, the service was awesome. Highly recommend and we'll for sure be back! 


Update* went back to Scarpetta and the menu was totally different and our waiter was not as friendly or knowledgeable. The food was still good but this time around I was a bit disappointed and I don't think I'll rave about it AS much."}
{"text":"Came here for a nice dinner after watching O. I really liked both the food and ambience at scarpetta. Since it was after the show, we walked in without a reservation and were able to get seated by the window. 

We shared the duck & foie ravioli and the black tagliolini with a side of mushrooms. I liked all 3 dishes - Even though you can't really taste the foie in the ravioli. The waiter told me they normally have a seared foie in the fall, but this year it wasn't here yet in october =( sad times. The mushrooms were really good! and I liked the black taliolini a little more than the ravioli. Overall, a great experience at a fairly reasonable price for vegas standards."}
{"text":"Scarpetta is certainly not an inexpensive meal, but it is well worth the price. The dining experience was wonderful. We had excellent service, great ambience, and the food was unique and delicious. 

After ordering a nice bottle of wine we started the meal with appetizers. I ordered the Salumi platter (italian meats) and was thoroughly impressed (although I did not enjoy the Lardo) by the variety of meats served. My wife had the beat salad and it was remarkably different that your typical beat salad and she loved it. Next we shared an order of the Cassinoi (sp?) pasta. It was homemade and tasted so. Tiny pasta dumplings stuffed in a light sauce...an excellent primi course. Next we both ordered mains. I had the Tenderloin in the Foie Gras reduction and my wife ordered a main course size version of the Polenta appetizer. Both were fantastic. Also, the bread at the begging is excellent, especially the bread laced with prosciutto. 

We won't be eating here regularly, but for another special evening out, we will definitely return. I highly recommend Scarpetta for anyone looking for a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"Im giving one star for the decor, one for the delicious spaghetti and one for the service. I'm being generous with the third star. We ordered the halibut (over cooked and kind of  bland for my tastebuds) burrata (good), mushrooms (dry, hard, tasteless with bits of dirt granules), the spaghetti (very delicious) and the Nutella donut balls (ok). But I wouldn't go back just for the spaghetti."}
{"text":"No more buffets in Vegas.  A crop of amazing restaurants are making Vegas a food destination.

Must Order:
Tomato & Basil pasta
Duck & Foie Gras pasta

The protein dishes were decent.  

Recommend the Pumpkin Cheesecake to end the meal."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious!  We got the lobster pasta with pesto, the scallops and yellow tail.  Everything was great, and so was the service.  I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I really can't give it 5 stars, as a matter of fact, quality of food vs price , most things we orders were not worth the prices. It's pretty much capital grill prices or even higher with lesser quality food / service. Their bruchetta was whateva , and the fillet was ok also. I asked to cook medium, and if came out fully cooked.  I think the best part was maybe bread and their hostess Lydia."}
{"text":"Owner Scott Conant (the dude from Chopped) hates raw onions. Therefore, I don't trust him... half kidding

I think Scarpetta is more like 4 stars, but I knocked off a star because our party definitely felt a little sick after eating here. Maybe it was an off day (we think it's from the cheese in the potatoes of a side dish).

Undeniably a beautiful spot to eat. The large windows display the neighboring Bellagio water fountain show, where my girlfriends and I packed into one side of the booth, so we could watch and eat at the same time.

Oysters West Coast - good, fresh raw oysters. I loved the horseradish sauce that came with it, and a gravy boat of tabasco was brought to us upon request

Stracci - a flat noodle pasta with lobster, crab, shrimp. There were generous portions of seafood and the pasta and tasted creamy/good.

Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli - I actually have to go against the hype to say that it was just okay, and not that great. The dish was a tad bit colder than luke warm, and just the richness of the foie gras/drier duck made it hard to finish the whole dish. Maybe a couple bites and I was pretty much done with it :-P

Black Cod - So soft and melted in my mouth (I think I ate a cloud..). 

Ribeye of Beef 24 oz - For $62, this had better been some good ribeye. Although I know that Scarpetta doesn't specialize in steak, I thought it was a bit overpriced for it being standard and nothing special.  Even though it was medium-rare, the steak was still a tad tough.

**don't fill up on the bread** Scarpetta has fantastic bread. The bread basket had 3-4 different kinds of breads, one of them being a melted roll of salami and cheese (a meal itself). And the bread came with mascarpone butter (LOVE), eggplant dip, and olive oil

One of the better restaurants in the Cosmo. Did anybody realize the restaurants in the City Center area (Cosmopolitan, Vdara, Aria) are not that great? Hmmm"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of pasta there is no place better than here.  Everything was spot on and high end.  A little tip, if you're going to reserve a booth make sure it's facing the Bellagio lake.  Everything we tried was really good, but the simple taste of that pasta and sauce is what's going to keep me coming back.  Perfect!  There are so many places in Vegas to choose from, but the pasta here is definitely the best!  Manja!"}
{"text":"Having been to the Scarpetta in NYC a few times we knew of the restaurant quality. The Las Vegas location did not disappoint in terms of food, service or ambiance. Our table overlooking the Bellagio fountains was spectacular. The caponata which is brought out with the bread basket is truly amazing. For appetizer, the Spaghetti was incomparable. It may seem too basic to order Spaghetti at an upscale, inventive restaurant but if you love house made pasta just do it! Their recipe is beyond fantastic and the dish is simply heaven. 

For entrée, we ordered a mezzaluna pasta which was one of the specials and probably one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. The pasta was stuffed with, if I remember correctly, goat cheese and spinach, topped with a light sauce, roasted cherry tomatoes, fried basil and ricotta salata. For desert, we opted for the classic Tiramisu cakes and it came with coffee gelato. The lady fingers were well soaked in kahlua and it tasted great.

Just a suggestion: The wine list is huge and has a very large selection but be careful, there are some very expensive bottles of wine on that list. I would recommend, if you are not a wine expert, telling the sommelier your preferred price point and types of wine you enjoy and asking him or her to make a selection. On this visit, we enjoyed a very nice Malbec after informing the sommelier of our tastes and food we had ordered from the menu.

Over all, the restaurant is beautifully decorated and the staff did a great job throughout our dinner. They brought out the bread basket and described the different types of bread. They answered all our questions about the menu and were very attentive. The whole experience at Scarpetta was wonderful and I look forward to returning again on my next trip to Vegas in few months."}
{"text":"Great view of the Bellagio fountains, romantical, ok food....

Located in the Cosmo, my man took me here for my birthday, so I would love to give this place a 5.  But we both agreed for how much you're paying, the food is just ok.  Service was attentive and our waiter made recommendations on the menu.  The ambiance is nice and of course if you can snag a table by the window, you'll have a lovely view of the Bellagio fountains.

*Complimentary bread basket with three different types of dipping oil:  citrus infused olive oil, eggplant, and mascarpone butter.  Would have been nice if the bread was warm.  The eggplant and mascarpone butter is soooo good.

*Short rib agnolotti-  little tortellinis stuffed with short rib in a brown butter  horseradish sauce topped with bread crumbs.    I love short rib so I had to order this.  I could hardly see let alone taste the short rib and the dish seemed like it was drenched in horseradish, making it really strong.  I don't mind some but wow I felt like it was coming out of my nose.

*Ribeye of beef- I laugh because I don't know why my man decided to order a steak at a Italian restaurant, but he was just in the mood for one.  But basically it was average, nothing wow.  Stick to Italian.

* Zepole- Nutella filled donuts topped with candied hazelnuts  with a vanilla dipping sauce.  O.m.g. Sooo deelish.

I don't know if I\"d come back but if I did I'd try the spaghetti.  Small little bowl of simple pasta for 24 bucks, but everyone keeps raving about it and even our waiter recommended it.  So it must have some kick ass sauce and noodles..."}
{"text":"I have been here several time for company events. Impressed with how they served the large group. Both times we took over the whole restaurant. 

Calamari, ravioli, salad and beef tenderloin I had left nothing to be desired. The house wine they served was tasty. 

I would come back here on my own."}
{"text":"Scarpetta was a great find in the Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas.  The decor is intimate yet trendy - as you walk into the restaurant along the bar there are several tables set into nooks along the wall which seem pretty cool.  The main dining room is full of comfortable tables although the aisles do get a bit crowded from time to time.

The service was good.  Our waiter was a bit verbose and over-the-top with his descriptions of the menu items but he provided answers to our questions and recommendations throughout the meal.

The food is the real star of the show here.  It was outstanding from the bread basket through dessert.  We ordered several appetizers including the polenta mushroom soup (creamy and rich), the beet salad, and the braised short ribs (outstanding flavor and cooked perfectly).  Several of us ordered the spaghetti for dinner and really enjoyed it - the sauce was nice and light and the basil really popped in the dish.  We also commented on the quality of the homemade pasta noodles.  A simple yet well done dish.  Others had the ravioli and tortellini dishes which were equally good.

For dessert they offer a banana and nutella dish with doughnuts.  This dessert is not to be underestimated - it was fantastic!  We also ordered the chocolate cake dessert which was very rich and full of chocolate goodness as well.

I highly recommend Scarpetta for dinner if you are in Vegas, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Scarpetta is a lovely italian restaurant inside The Cosmopolitan. We were seated near the entrance but still had a good view of the Bellagio fountains which became more spectacular as it grew darker outside. They had a nice assortment of bread to start along with a healthy list of specials that included diver scallops and foie gras, which my husband ordered. I started with the white corn soup with Dungeness crab which was sweet, buttery and one of the best soups I've ever tasted. For my main course, I ordered the duck and foie gras ravioli. My dish might have been better if I didn't try my husband's dish which had actual pieces of seared foie gras. Holy duck liver, Batman! With my dish, I thought that combining the duck and the liver in the ravioli just muddied the flavors of both food items that I found so enjoyable. We finished the meal off with coffee and shared a delightfully light mascarpone cheesecake.

The prices are a bit high, as expected from a fine dining establishment on the Strip, yet not prohibitive. The service was spot on, warm and unobtrusive. Let the waitstaff know if you are vegetarian or on a gluten-free diet and they will provide you a separate menu."}
{"text":"Romantic space with great view. I had the Duck Foie Gras Ravioli, which was quite good. Tasted a lot like beef stroganoff. I don't drink, so I asked for the bartender to make me something non alcoholic that was fruity & sweet. Not sure exactly what it was, but it was quite tasty. The chocolate cake did not meet expectations though. It was dry & not sweet enough. My husband & I did not finish it."}
{"text":"Just okay. 

Perhaps I should have ordered that spaghetti that everyone raves about. 

I ordered the short rib agnolotti instead. It was just okay. 

The foie gras ravioli was just okay too.

Our table, however, was amazing. It overlooked the window with a view of the Bellagio fountains. We got to see the water show several times during our meal. 

Overall three stars."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining on the strip in a classy restaurant like this. My friend booked a private dining room for 12 people. It had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains by the window. Our server explained the menu to us and brought out some delicious bread too. Their rosemary one is very savory. I got the Pici which had a nice texture and a bountiful amount of lobster. Worth the price. It had a bit of a spice to it too. But oh goodness I tried a bite of my friend's pork chop and I'm obsessed. It was tender and fall off the bone good. Even the pairing of vegetables like charred fruit that was on the side was divine. I also tried my friends duck and it was very well cooked. Will definitely be trying a protein dish there the next time I go back. Only 4/5 though because I wanted to bring in a dessert but they said they would charge $7.50 per person for a cake cutting fee. I get that it's the strip but that's overdoing it a bit."}
{"text":"I went with a few friends for my boyfriend's birthday. Our table was ready over half-an-hour after our reservation. Not a big deal.

The service was friendly and very attentive.

The food was good, not exceptional. Except for the bread basket and the polenta with mushrooms. They were both so good! There are other, less expensive or equally priced, Italian restaurants in downtown Toronto that I l like more, so I probably won't be back very often."}
{"text":"Yes I'm a fan.... wife and I went here on the recommendation of a colleague and man was he on point.  He suggested i order several thing for starters the polenta and the octopus. Also, suggested the spaghetti. To some that may sound so simple but to me i judge all Italian restaurants by the spaghetti.  If they can not get that right then they don't deserve a repeat visit. Scarpetta's pasta was delicious and the gravy/sauce was good too.  I'm not into Italian fine dining too much ... im into the family style eating pounds of pasta and gravy with some huge meatballs and sausage kinda guy ... and im Filipino go figure!!! but when i do go to a fine dining establishment that Italian scarpetta is my choice.... try it you might like it!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on Saturday night with a friend.  The bread with 3 dippers (olive oil, a tapenade and a butter/marscapone spread was wonderful.  We moved on to sharing 3 appetizers, the scallops, tuna and a caprese salad.  The tuna was our favorite, but they were all quite good.  I had a spaghetti dish called Pici.  Lobster and spaghetti in a sauce with a spicy finish.  The ladies had the short rib agnolotti which was also very delicious.  We decided that the Pici was the best of the two just because of the wonderful spiciness. All of the pastas were cooked perfectly.  The service was great, and we were never rushed to decide what we wanted to eat or to finish anything.  It was a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Dined here for my birthday and the staff did try to make it memorable. They seated us next to the windows to watch the Bellagio fountains at sunset. 
We ordered the mushrooms and polenta for an appetizer. I could not stop eating it! Creamy polenta, completely smooth, mushrooms in a jus- I wanted to drink the sauce. Rich, thick, savory. Be sure to order that. 
We both ordered the short rib agnolotti for our main dish. It does say it has horseradish it the dish but we were expecting just a hint of it. It was overwhelming. That was all you could taste. That's why the 3 star rating. 
They did bring me a dessert tasting menu for my birthday that was delicious. 
I would go here again, but would order a different main dish."}
{"text":"Normally, I'm not an Italian foodie fan -- my man and I lean towards Asian flavors.... so when Scarpetta was suggested for a business meal, I rolled my eyes and thought: oh well.  Wow, I was wrong!!  Ambiance is everything you expect from a Strip resto -- seductive and stylish, modern but comfortable... the list goes on.  The wine was fantastic, as was everything I ordered (read: tuna 'susci;' their special pasta of the day made with squid ink -- app. portion, if you please; and the branzino... WOW!) Didn't think I had any room for dessert... but made room for heaven when it came to the table -- the zeppole was all that... and then some.  Service was sometimes slow, though the servers themselves were extremely knowledgeable about the menu and were quick to make suggestions once given info about preferences. Love this place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I came here with a slightly odd combination of diners - my husband, his parents, and my cousin and his girlfriend.  Yet between the food and ambiance, I had a great time.

One of my complaints during my time living in Toronto was that there wasn't much memorable food.  Granted, when I was a student I would in no way have been able to afford to eat here, but now for a special occasion I'd highly recommend it.  Scott Conant got rave reviews when Scarpetta opened in New York, and finally, another great chef has opted to open up an outpost to the north.

The restaurant is located in the Thompson hotel and is all forms of swanky.  The booths are round and go around a serpentine piece of wood.  The interior is very modern yet also airy.

We were promptly served delicious homemade bread with tapenade and a delicious butter-mascarpone spread.  We split a few appetizers, including the Tuna \"susci\" and the hamachi crudo.  Both were really fresh and delicious.  My husband and his dad opted to split a squid dish and were also fans of that.

Now, for the entree there weren't too many non-meat options, so I stuck with the spaghetti with tomato & basil.  I'm not the biggest fan of basil, and I usually opt for thinner pastas than spaghetti, so I didn't know how well this would fly.  But no, this is what pasta is, people.  It was a perfect al dente - not too mushy, but also not too hard.  The sauce was luscious and creamy and the basil tasted fresh and didn't overpower the sauce in the slightest.  And while the portion size is not nearly as large as what you'll get at a generic red-sauce restaurant, it was still plenty large to fill me up.

Everyone else also enjoyed their dishes, though I can't recall exactly what they ordered.  The service was very attentive and our water glasses were constantly refilled.

The meal wound up being pricey since some members of our group chose to have wine or cocktails (when we eat out solo, J & I rarely order drinks) but the entrees themselves were on the high side of moderate.  The only other fine-ish dining place I've been to in TO is Susur Lee's Lee, so I'd definitely be up for adding Scarpetta to my \"special occasion Toronto eateries.\""}
{"text":"I originally went to Scarpetta in New York and LOVED it. After moving to Los Angeles, I went to the one in Beverly Hills pretty often (until they closed recently) and enjoyed every experience there, too.

We got to Vegas fairly late on a Friday night and I was excited to find out that Scarpetta was still open. We were seated quickly and I knew everything that I wanted to order (short rib risotto, spaghetti, and the chicken). 

Directly in front of our table, there was a table of 4, one person that was visibly very intoxicated. I wasn't surprised at all since it is Vegas and a Friday night. However, the waiter kept serving the entire table more wine, even as this guy was slurring and barely able to hold himself up. 

I'm halfway into my risotto when I notice him put his head down on the table. The restaurant is fairly empty at this point so there are a lot of staff just standing around. By the time I'm done with the risotto, he's completely lying down in his booth. My spaghetti comes out, and as I take a bite of my delicious food, I look up to see the guy projectile vomit. It's splashing all over the booth and the sound is as gross as the actual view.

The staff get over there and start cleaning up and a few minutes later, someone stops by at our table to see how we're doing. I tell him we've obviously lost our appetite and he asks if we would like our plates (which are nearly untouched) packed up. They bring us our food in to go boxes along with the bill.

So I'm not an unreasonable person. I don't blame Scarpetta for a drunk person in Vegas on a Friday night. The issue I have is that they continued to serve drinks to him, leading to him vomiting in front of other patrons. After that, we don't even get an apology, the manager doesn't stop by, and we're asked to pay for the entire bill. 

The situation was handled poorly by their staff, and I still had to pay for the entire crappy experience."}
{"text":"I loved Scarpetta in New York, and the one in Las Vegas did not disappoint. The food, atmosphere, and service were all incredible. They seated us by the window, so we could enjoy the Bellagio fountain show every 15 minutes. 

All of the food was fantastic, including the bread basket they bring out in the beginning. Our starters were the grilled octopus and beef carpaccio. The beef carpaccio definitely stole the show, and went great with the accompanying parmesan crisps. I got the foie gras duck ravioli, which was solid and full of flavor. My bf got the short rib agnolotti, and if I could do it over again I would have done the same. While my ravioli was good, the agnolotti was excellent. Either way, you can't go wrong with their fresh-made pastas. 

Unfortunately we were too full to get more than a glass of wine or dessert (thanks to an all you can eat brunch buffet), but I'm sure the dessert and cocktails would have been great. If I am in NY or Las Vegas, I will definitely come back to Scarpetta!"}
{"text":"I can truly say that I've had a complete Cinderella experience here during my sister's Bachelorette party. Our host Bex was amazing and truly opened the door for us to experiencing the world of V.I.P.! The staff was very polite and helpful. Our private room was spectacular-we had an amazing view of the Belagio Fountain!

The executive sous chef came out to talk to us and gave us an intro on their specialties. I am the type of person who cannot make up their mind on what to order so the chef gave me some suggestions and there we began our round of unforgettable appetizers. 

I definitely lived it up that night-felt so important and spoiled to have the staff wait on us the way they did. Small details like having the chair pulled out for you, the napkin laid across your lap, even the pretty bottles of water all added up.

The food, of course, was other worldly. Everything from the main course to the desserts were such a dream. I could not believe I was eating all the delicious food that I see hyped up so much on tv. 

I notice a lot of small details and absolutely everything-even the atmosphere as well as the design of the restaurant was beautiful, unique, and classy. The whole experience at Scarpetta exceeded above and beyond in all areas. I have never been so pampered my whole life and I simply CANNOT and will NOT do Vegas any other way! I highly recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was definitely overpriced for the food. My boss was not too happy at all with the food. We took one of our colleagues who was born and raised and still goes back and forth from Italy and he did not like the food for the price. The service, however was amazing and so was the view. Definitely s romantic place."}
{"text":"Great fine dining! Love the atmosphere! Was here was my husband and did a full tasting with wine pairing and to my surprise portions by the time you hit the 4th course it was definitely filling! Had a romantic table overlooking the Bellagio so it was really nice! It's pricey but well worth it!

Came back again with just my 8 year old daughter for mommy and me getaway and my little one has a fine palette! The best thing still is their spaghetti!

Service is always good but regardless you repaying to be a a fine dining place and atmosphere. We also stayed at the Cosmo and ll their rest is to only convenient but all delicious!"}
{"text":"Social hour review.

My friends and I decided to check out the Social Hour at the Cosmo. It was everything you expect it to be: dark, trendy, sexy. The drink menu for Social Hour was kind of limited, but it had options that I liked sooooo works for me.

They put chips out on the bar that I could not stop eating because what even is willpower.

Definitely recommend for a trendy drink spot during social hour."}
{"text":"This was our fancy splurge celebration dinner while we were in Vegas. I tried to make reservations for 10 online through their website, but I was told that there were no reservations available within 2.5 hours of our reservation time (830pm on a Sunday) for 8 weeks. I called instead, and they were able to accommodate us. 

When we got there, we had to wait for a little while for them to get our table together, but the cocktail menu was beautiful. I indulged in the Gallardo, Hendrick's apple, lime, and basil. It was fresh and clean, really light and flavorful. It also came with a basil leaf floating in it, and was gorgeous. 

When they seated us, they'd given us a private dining room for our large group, and we had an amazing server who was knowledgeable, friendly, and willing to make suggestions. 

The meal started with fresh baked rosemary bread served with a trip of condiments. There was soft, whipped marscapone butter, a rich eggplant tapenade, and simple quality olive oil. I order the spring pea soup with dungeness crab, almonds, and pea tendrils as a starter. It was so delicate, fresh, and really lovely. It tasted like spring. The crunch and nutty flavor from the almonds and the sweet meaty taste of the shredded crab was such a nice balance of the pea flavor. It was spring green, and melted in my mouth. I'm not even a huge fan of peas, but this is such a good example of how fresh, high-quality ingredients can elevate something simple to culinary art. 

For dinner, I had the Pici with lobster that the server suggested. This is the best pasta I've ever eaten. And I've eaten a lot of pasta. It's house made and fresh, and this is how al dente is supposed to be. It's firm and chewy, but still delicate and flavorful. It was made with tarragon, so it was green and herby. The pesto was made of almonds and chili, so it had a little spice to it. I could've handled more spice, though. There was almost no heat, but it's OK because the other flavors were so perfect. This is also the best cooked lobster I've ever had. I'm used to lobster in butter, or pieces so small thrown into dishes to give them an upscale feel, but these were beautiful, pink large pieces of lobster. They still benefited from the fat in the olive oil pesto, and it brought out lobster flavors I hadn't tasted before. They were tender and meaty, and balanced well with the pasta and pesto. It was simply one of the best pasta meals I've ever had in my life.

One of the house specialties is spaghetti with tomato and basil. Sounds easy, right? Once again, one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had in my life. The ingredients and technique are so high-quality that they elevate even the simplest meals into a once-in-a-lifetime experience. 

The filet was tender and flavorful, although my companion felt is was little more medium-well than the medium he ordered. The potato puree it rested on absorbed the steak juices and every bite tasted luxurious. 

The honey glazed carrots with toasted pistachios were roasted to perfection. They were soft, but not limp or mushy, and the pistachios added a pleasant nutty crunch. They were sweet, but not cloying, and well balanced. Again, I'm not a huge carrot fan, but these made me a believer. 

My one 21st-century complaint is the lights are so low, I wasn't able to get great pictures, but really, that's probably a plus. It was intimate and romantic. 

Indulge at Scarpetta and you won't regret it. Take your time and savor the flavors at this masterful restaurant. There's a lot of work and knowledge going into these meals, and if you're privileged enough to eat here, relish every bite."}
{"text":"Food was phenomenal. The bread was very fresh and spreads were great. I had the lobster ravioli and demolished it. The portions were perfect but higher pricing. 

The wine by the glass list was disappointing. Out of al the bottle options, you would think the glass list would be more fruitful but it was very limited. 

Service was great and everyone was attentive. Great ambiance and we had a great view of the bellagio water show!"}
{"text":"Went to Scarpetta for Winterlicious this year. I did dine there previously yet my review is still the same- just okay.

For my starter I go the Braised Short Beef Ribs- these were real good, fall off of the bone and delicious, however the risotto that came with it was not that great. It was just fine. If they just gave me the beef, I would have enjoyed it so much more.

My second course was the Organic Chicken. The first breast it came with was amazing. The crispy layer on time is a wonderful touch. However when it came the my second and third piece it seemed like the end bites were undercooked and were very chewy and slimy...had to force it down. 

The last part was dessert. I had the Coconut Panacotta. Let me say this was tres yummy. It also came with a coconut ice cream which was equally as good. This was the high light of the meal.

The atmosphere at Scarpetta is very snooty. I mean the price tag matches it, when I went their last time my meal cost $100 + tip, Winterlicious helped me dine with half the price tag!  Service was decent. The waiter forgot my drink and admitted he did, also I originally asked to change my reservation, they stated it couldn't be done, yet when I was there it wasn't packed, there were multiple tables so they could have switched it for me. Also, I was sat at a pretty not so hot table, I mean cut me some slack, its not packed there give me a good table.

So based on all of those factors its a 3. Had they switched my reservation, brought me my drink, and had a tad better food, they would be a 4, but they didn't"}
{"text":"Been to Scarpetta in both LV and NY and this place doesn't disappoint! Everything I've tried has packed so much flavor. In LV we had the duck & foie gras ravioli, the beet salad, the uni & lobster tagliolini, and the branzino. Everything came out perfect. My fave of the night was definitely the uni & lobster pasta -- SO GOOD. Creamy but not overly rich, and the roe added nice texture to the dish. Can't wait to come back to this restaurant! FYI, corkage fee is $35."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Scarpetta for over five years and I'm very glad I did. 
When I sat down I ended up waiting for seven minutes, no water, no menu. (I had reservations too)
Servers kept looking at me and it was almost 10pm so not a super packed house. 
No apology for the wait, and especially dining alone, they should have at least given me a menu or some water. I would have left if it hit the 10 minute mark but I was here for the food.

The food definitely delivers, and it was some of the best pasta I have ever had and reminded me of my time in Italy. The flavor of the pasta took me back. I had the short rib - bone marrow agnolotti. The crunch on top made the entire dish that much better.

Also order the diver scallops with foie gras. Very rich, but the marriage of flavors works beautifully. 

Nutella and vanilla bomboloni -with banana ice cream. Yup. It's good. It's really good. 

I give this location a 4.5/5 stars."}
{"text":"Seriously love this place. Tend to come here allot after work and the food is always amazing and so good!!"}
{"text":"My number one, oh wow, surprisingly fantastic meal of my most recent Vegas trip. I say suprisingly because we came here on a whim after the group decided we wanted Italian for dinner. Based on the yelp reviews, and the fact that they are in the posh Cosmo, we were able to make a last minute reservations. 
    The uber contemporary interior was very inviting while giving some great views of the strip and the bellagio fountains. The star of this dinner was by far the spaghetti. The absolute best cooked pasta I have ever had.  The best. House made pasta cooked to a perfect al dente. It actually had that slight \"crunch\" a perfect pasta should have, but raaaaarely does. All the other pastas were fantastic as well.  Scarpetta is a perfect combination of style and execution. I would say a must try."}
{"text":"There is nothing to hate at Scarpetta. 

The service, views, food and ambiance were top rate. We had the scallop appetizer, and instead of us sharing off one plate, they put one scallop on each of our plates so we could individually taste what a perfectly cooked and garnished scallop tastes like. 

Next, my husband had the foie gras ravioli which he didn't shovel into his mouth because he wanted to enjoy and savor each bite. I had the gluten free spaghetti with tomato and basil sauce. You'd think something so simple wouldn't get your heart racing, but there was nothing simple about the flavor of this beautifully done dish. 

Finally, we ended with the gluten free chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce. This was not the dinky salted caramel sauce you get at a coffee shop - this is the sauce that ruins all sauces on desserts. If it wasn't so upscale, I probably would have licked the plate and asked for a gallon of this sauce. The gelato had a perfect rich, creamy texture, and it complimented the cake and the sauce instead of taking over the plate. The textures and taste of this cake alone is a reason to come here. 

Everything about Scarpetta is excellent. Try to get a table near the windows to catch views of the Bellagio Fountains while you enjoy some of the best food in Vegas."}
{"text":"As guest we felt like a burden instead of welcomed and we found the foods  we tried as one dimensional and under seasoned , flat and the dessert awful . Maybe they just weren't in the working flow of things yet or maybe it just was an off night I don't know.

The door was wide open at 5:25 so we walked in and the hostess told us to make a reservation for 5:30 and to leave and come back in a few minutes . We thought that seemed odd but thought it was just because she was very young and figured that was all it was and came back a few minutes latter .

Too start with I received a white lint filled napkin on top of my black pants , but I did notice they have black linen napkins they use for the wine bottles. 

We felt uncomfortable the whole time dining because most of the time I saw up to eleven members of staff were standing across from us with their backs against the wall just looking out into our direction . I glared at them a few times but they didn't budge .

We started with the tuna susci -described as marinated vegetables with preserved truffles , everything was raw and everything had little taste.

We shared the short rib agnolotti , that were like mini raviolis filled with short rib that had a baby food texture inside the well made pasta. Maybe ten percent of the  agnolottis we topped with a scant amount of toasted  crumbs slightly laced with horseradish for flavor that were resting in some browned butter.

The black cod although cooked nicely would have been forgettable but was not , only because of the concentrated tomato that I found interesting .  this dish was extremely mild and under seasoned with a few pieces of fennel that were nicely caramelized .

My husband had the duck breast and he said it was his least favorite one he ever had since the skin wasn't crispy and also lacked flavor , he thought it wasn't seasoned at all .

We had a little time to kill before the show so we thought maybe dessert might be good . We ordered the zeppole I don't mean to be mean or disrespectful but honest to God they tasted just like the chocolate muffins of the Sweet Tomatoes salad bar buffet , the zeppole were bread like , not sweet , almost not chocolate flavored and only a few zeppole not all had essence of nutella in them . 

At this price range they don't have this much room for error."}
{"text":"Lovely surprise.

Randomly picked this place to take my boss and another colleague. 

Ordered the Spaghetti (tomato & basil) based on the server's recommendation. Have to admit thought it was rather bold of the dude to suggest the spaghetti as the pasta to try. But it was very good, al dente handmade noodles with the right balance of sweet and acidity of the tomato & basil sauce. 

Also the field greens was rather good even though it wasn't listed on the menu. There is a smear of some kind of nut butter, candied walnut and uber fresh greens with light vinaigrette salad."}
{"text":"Very attentive staff, gorgeous decor (albeit a bit dark), quality food:

Braised short ribs with spring vegetables and farro rissoto: Fall-off the bone tender, perfectly seasoned, and I enjoyed the twist on the rissoto

Roasted sea scallops: Cooked to perfection, not too briny or rubbery, to go very well with the white truffle asparagus, not too overwhelmed by the rich truffle oil.

Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli: Delicious, but too decadent for my taste. They give you a huge portion, too, about 3 times the amount I actually was expecting, even for an entree. Filling, with a good salty bite. Finishing this was the death of me, but a very enjoyable self-indulgent death.

Spaghetti: I love when simple, basic dishes are just beautifully executed. This was just the perfect spaghetti. I would be perfectly okay walking into a restaurant like this and ordering it. It is divine.

Mediterranean Branzino: Seafood party in my mouth. Branzino had a nice caramelized crust and the medley of vegetables and shrimp/clams/etc paired really well with the light broth.

Aged Sirloin of Beef: cooked to bloody medium-rare excellence. Enjoyed the salty/nutty bite of Parmagiano.

As for cocktails, I can recommend the Gimlet and the Gallardo."}
{"text":"What a giant disappointment. We saved Scarpetta for our final night in Vegas because it was my first choice of a new place to try. We won't ever return.

We had reservations at 6:30. We arrived at 6:24. I know this because the hostess pointed to the clock and noted that she would seat us in 6 minutes, since our reservation was for 6:30 pm. They were not busy -- no one else was waiting to be seated and only two people were sitting at the bar. We had to ask twice to check a coat, even though they have a clearly marked coat check.

At this point, we just figured the hostess was inexperienced or having a rough day. Once we were seated, we were promptly greeted and placed our cocktail orders. Our drinks took almost 20 minutes to arrive -- although we could see there were fewer than 20 people in the entire restaurant and there were at least 5 servers standing around chatting. The rest of the night, the service remained scattered, at best. We were rushed through our first course, but had to flag down the server to order dessert. 

On top of this, the server was constantly pushing us to \"upgrade,\" after telling us that most of the plates, as is, are pretty minimal and that most people end up having to add to them with a second round of orders. For example, I ordered the fritto misto salad, which runs $18. The server warned me I should order a second primi, as well. He wasn't kidding -- I got two bites of greens with a dusting of lemon and seasoning. In short, the portions are small even for an upscale, trendy restaurant.

This place has one saving grace: the tomato and basil spaghetti. I admit I'm pretty picky about Italian food after I lived in Italy for a summer. I understand that it's rarely as good in the States. Although it's not as good as you'd get in Italy, the tomato and basil spaghetti is done well here. It has a nice light sauce (it's not arrabbiata -- it's a pureed sauce), and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.

I had the strawberry souffle for dessert. It was adequate, although it was fairly cool by the time they got it to the table. The coffee was fine, but the server forgot the extra shot of Frangelico I requested.

On the plus side, it's really beautiful. If you can get a seat in the windows, they overlook the Bellagio fountains (unfortunately, the window seats also overlook the Bellagio gardening sheds and dumpsters...so don't look down!). Overall, the decor fits in well with the contemporary vibe at the Cosmo. It's urban, beautifully designed, and hip. It's fresh, upscale, and open without being fussy or stuffy.

As beautiful as it is and as great as that pasta plate was -- I won't be back."}
{"text":"The view and ambience says it all. 
The impeccable service to exceed expectations of a nice, memorable, romantic dinner is absolutely the best. 
The dessert menu definitely gives that amusingly delightful smile after the initial to the final bite of soothing silky smoothness of that caramel sea salt dreamy pudding. Then the pastry chef's delectable dessert of the night... Absurdly decadent. 
This establishment is a \"must revisit,\" type of place."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Vegas, and my dear friend treated me as farewell meal. Even though I'm leaving Vegas, when I visit I will always return here. This is my 7th time here and I always try something new. This time it was the pasta with octopus and bone marrow,  topped with very delicious bread crumbs! The name of the dish was Gargnelli or something like that, regardless it was exquisite! My friend and I shared the polenta, because even if you come here 100 times you MUST have the polenta with fricasse mushrooms!  That is in my top 5 list for sure, but tonight something was not spot on I must admit, but I still enjoyed it. If you like cocktails the San Remo is the bomb. I have learned to make them at home because I enjoy so much! Luis our server deserves a huge shout out because he was wonderful.  This is another fabulous part of Scarpetta HOSPITALITY is A+++ all other places should send their staff here to learn from the best! I sincerely enjoy this restaurant and have turned many others on to it and they would agree :-)"}
{"text":"Owner Scott Conant should be ashamed!!

We, my wife and I, arrived and were seating at a nice window table per our request. 
After that, its ALL DOWNHILL.

Server, some jackass who really could care less about being professional and more concerned about the table of 3 girls a few table away giving them free food all night.
He finally arrived at our table about 5 minutes after being seated, took our cocktail orders and then....disappeared.
He came back with our drinks 15 minutes later and blamed the \"bartenders were backup up\". Really? Because our martinis were warm when you served us which were very ordinary and especially at $15 per.

Busboy brought us bread which only one type was decent so we just asked for that only instead. Waiter \"I will make sure to get that out to you immediately\" That never happened.

Food: 
Heirloom tomato with Burrata- meh! I know its very simple and the wife wanted it but was as if Olive Garden made it. Really nothing special and was not seasoned properly.

Polenta with morels- again meh! Average at best.

Spaghetti what he is known for- very good not great. Would I order that again, no.

Halibut- dry! 

This place is a joke and we got duped! 

Pedestrian Food, Awful Service, High Prices = Avoid!"}
{"text":"Started off with the squid & octopus appetizer, followed by the duck & foie gras ravioli, which were both delicious."}
{"text":"This is a late review as I've been really lazy but I'm trying to catch up! I came here with my boyfriend in November 2013 for this birthday and had the tasting menu. It was nothing short of amazinnng!  I will warn you, the portions are large for a tasting menu and you will get full! Ladies don't make the mistake of wearing a tight dress like I did! I was iffy about the tasting menu because I normally wouldn't choose to order most of what was on it and my boyfriend isn't a huge seafood person but we were feeling adventurous and wow were we surprised. The items I remembered the most were the raw yellowtail, fennel dusted black cod, spaghetti, and the desserts! Who knew simple spaghetti could be soo good! They were also sooo nice to give us three extra items on top of the tasting menu! Oh and also, their bread basket is the best I've had. Stromboli bread. Oh my goodness, I have dreams about this bread haha. The  ambience is very romantic and dimmly lit yet didn't feel stuffy or stiff like some higher end restaurants. I wish I took pictures but since our table was in the middle of two others tables I didn't want to disturb anyone with the flash of my camera. Oh and the view is really pretty! I hope to be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Party of 10. Ordered entrees, no appetizers & the service felt forever! There was no friendly gesture of the long wait or even up sale on appetizers or drinks. Don't get me wrong though food was amazing."}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary which I booked reservations in advance.  We arrived at 6:35 and by 8:00 didn't have our main courses served.  Multiple other tables, whom arrived either when we did or after, had their meals consumed before we got ours. We orders three appetizers and only two showed up.  

When the meal did show up, the Lamb Chops (no idea why they called them chops when they were rack of lamb) were BLUE!  They took them back to the kitchen and while two people in the party continued to eat their meal (while they were still close to warm because they showed up already on the cold side).  The lamb came back and was now over cooked!   Even the ends/bone that is exposed were black/burnt.   By this time I ate was presented only because I was starving. 

The real question here is why two stars.  Correction, why one star because originally was going to give two but I cannot in good conscience give more than one.  One is for bring your own wine.  

Needless to say, we will never go back."}
{"text":"When I die, my heaven will include a daily dining experience at Scarpetta.  My boyfriend and I absolutely loved every minute.  When I come back to Vegas, I will be returning to this restaurant and having the exact same meal.  The scallop appetizer was perfectly paired with the foie gras; the beets and burrata appetizer had elements of sweet, savory, and sour (provided by the vinegarette).  But my favorite part of the meal was the simple, fresh spaghetti.  So divine.  The fresh ingredients and pasta sings in every bite.  I would eat this for breakfast lunch and dinner if I could.  Panna Cotta and Bananas Foster souffle to finish.  We left stuffed and happy.  Ready to take on Vegas!!  There is a gorgeous side view of the Bellagio fountains.  However, there is a large bar that extends the entire window so it perfectly blocks your view if you sit beside the window.  Why the designer would not just put floor to ceiling windows, thereby providing an uninterrupted view is beyond me."}
{"text":"A very nice alternative if you want a break from the Vegas buffets!  The creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms was amazing.  Had the duck and foie gras ravioli and it was equally as amazing....a bit rich but not overly rich where you felt sick after.  Was able to polish off the entire dish with no problem - and the portion was pretty generous considering you're at a high-end restaurant.  Normally at great Italian places they tend to skimp on the portions but they didn't.  My mom had the black cod and that was tasty as well.....but since their pasta is fresh I would recommend trying one of their pastas.  Bread basket was great, they have this salami bread that was awesome!  

Definitely have to try the one in Beverly Hills now!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends brought me here for my bachelorette dinner. Our server Titus was awesome and they had a pretty decent wine list.

The food fell a little flat for me. 

The complimentary bread basket was phenomenal. My favorite was the focaccia with prosciutto.  Bread came with three different spreads: whipped butter mascarpone, eggplant caponata and a lemon infused olive oil.  Thy were all delicious but I especially enjoyed the eggplant caponata.

I ordered the Wagyu beef tartare as my appetizer. The beef wasn't as red as I would've liked it to be. It looked brown but I couldn't tell if it was from the bad lighting of the restaurant. The dish had no flavor and I basically had to force myself to eat it.

I ordered the duck and foie gras ravioli with a marsala reduction for my entree. I like that they make their own fresh pasta but the dish lacked the debt of flavor you'd expect from the components of this dish. It was like waiting for a climax that never came.

My friend really enjoyed her pea soup but the other girls didn't really rave about their dishes. 

The desserts (I forgot which ones we ordered) were great! We all definitely enjoyed that. 

The restaurant's decor is okay. It's somewhere between modern and classic. The lighting is really bad... Or good if you like it on the darker side. I like being able to see my food when I eat."}
{"text":"Server was knowledgeable and polite. Seated in the corner by the window over looking the water show. Amazing. Spaghetti is a small portion, but delicious and filling. Meatballs are very tiny like pellets. I loved it. Oysters were delicious with the Champagne. Great place for a date. My date really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Dangit this place is good. 

We made a reservation because they were packed on a Friday night. It was last minute so we couldn't eat until 8. We were ready for some food! We both ordered the gnocchi with bacon and truffle oil. 

Sadly our order got lost after it was taken to the kitchen  and we ended up waiting 40 minutes for food. But the whole time, the waitress was so nice and apologetic and I could tell the kitchen was really embarrassed. When the meal came it was divine. That's the only way to put it. I had died and gone to heaven. 

Because of the mix up they offered us some yummy desserts on the house. The cheese cake was great! I was expecting more dessert options and it was weird that the waitress was kind of complaining about how only some of the desserts are tasty. But whatever. Free dessert!

At the end even with the free dessert the bill was a little high for us lower class folks but Dangit if we won't be back because the food was insane and the service was friendly.

If you like real italian food, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Unreal spaghetti. I know, it's spaghetti you say. Easy enough. It's amazing. Saw it on the Techniques episode of No Reservations, tried it, then had to punch myself for not trying it sooner in NY. Everything else was great too. Yellowtail and fritto misto to start, spaghetti and black cod to finish. Highlight was the spaghetti though."}
{"text":"Service was just what you would hope for in a restaurant of this caliber. Attentive to every need, but never in your space. 

We started with the octopus and squid salad. A fantastic choice. It was served some clover, chick peas, and a slice of octopus that was so tender, I couldn't believe it! The squid was rolled up plated with some greens as well. It was delish!

The pasta we chose was the house speciality - tomato and basil. It was so fresh and so basil-y! There was just something about it - almost creamy, but not creamy. The texture was all to do with the tossing of the pasta and sauce with a little EVOO as a second step. Yeah, I asked. 

For dinner I chose the veal chop, and I'm so glad that I did. It was cooked perfectly and was just the right size portion. My husband had the fennel crusted cod. It is prepared with the skin on, and was very nice (so he says, because I didn't get a taste!). 

Then dessert was a spectacle to behold. The anniversary trio was complete with chocolate-filled doughnuts, strawberry milkshakes, chocolate toffee brittle, and ice cream, too. It was unbelievable. 

We will definitely make this a regular stop in the LV book!"}
{"text":"Scarpetta was very good, I am pretty mad that I did not order the duck ravioli though.

We brought a bottle of nice vino, and corkage was $35. Steep compared to Jaleo which only charged us $25. 

The pasta was amazing, very doughy and fresh. Apparently they make it hand-made every day, crazy. I had the Pici Lobster which was good but needed more sauce on it.

The heirloom tomato salad was great, but it came with a massive amount of cheese. So it was very rich and filling so be prepared to eat a lot of good cheese.

Skipped dessert, two people was around $200."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for her 40th Birthday and they knew we were coming and the reason. 

This was our first time here. We arrived minutes after 9PM.

The restaurant was dimly lit. The atmosphere was LOUD. Nothing romantic about this setting at all. 

HOSTESS

Her greeting was like listening to an answering machine. We had a 9:30 reservation (90 min before closing) and got sat in front of a pillar. I could not see the Bellagio fountains that seems to influence everybody's reviews. About 20 min later, 2 tables opened up that were right against the glass. In my reservation I let them know it was a special occasion. 

SERVER

Like the hostess, it was like watching blue man group after 3 straight performances. 

Just going through the motions. 

We were not interested in cocktails or wine, but were focused on some great cuisine. The server did stop once to go over the menu, but all he did was say \"these are the apps, these are the pastas, these are the main courses\" etc. etc. They must get a lot of people who never viewed a menu before. 

We ordered the Misto fritto, Farmers salad, Fennel Black Cod, and wrapped Veal loin. (I did not take any pictures this time, I did not want my review to be a distraction of the occasion) 

FOOD

My wife loved the complimentary bread which included dippers of olive oil, roasted eggplant and tomatoes, and truffle butter. The bread was varieties of an Italian Sourdough, foccacia, stromboli, and a vegetable stromboli. 

They automatically split our app & salad which I appreciated. 

MISTO FRITTO

The menu description was very vague, but I figured it had to be a spin off of fried calamari. Tempura battered squid, white anchovies, cauliflower, and the stems of chives. There were no anchovies in my plate, and happened to be my wife's first bite on her's which she did not like at all. I would not have known about the anchovies (which I love) if I did not finish her plate. The fry was perfect, and I really liked the seasoning which included rosemary. 

FARMERS SALAD

The presentation was beautiful. Some of the vegetables (green & yellow squash) were almost shaved. It was a nice salad, but not much flavor. There were only 2 choices of salad on the menu and I chose this one. My wife ate only half of hers. 

VEAL LOIN

There is a picture of this dish in the archives. 3 (2oz?) wrapped pieces of veal perfectly cooked. A few pieces of carrots and another vegetable. I tasted some sort of mustard on this dish with another sauce. The menu (again) was VERY vague. As I ate, I was wondering what the expense was in making this dish that carried a $38 price. 


BLACK COD

Presentation was standard, Looked to be about a 5oz filet. My wife was half way through her dish without a sound. Knowing my wife, this means she did not want to disappoint me in saying she did not care for it. I tried a bite and thought it was weird for Cod to be so mushy. It was not pleasant at all. Maybe even undercooked. 
My wife at all the vegetables and there was half of the filet sitting alone on the plate when the busser took it away. Sad that no one noticed that half of what was supposed to be the hero of this dish was being tossed out like a used tissue. 

We passed on dessert because to me, dessert should be the perfect finish to a perfect meal which this whole experience was not. My wife liked the complimentary bread the best and I liked the Fritto Misto the best. There was some woman in a very loud group making noises that reminded me of farm animals in heat. 

It shouldn't be this way in a restaurant of this price point.   

I asked for the check (1app, 1 salad, 2 entrees) $116.00 

As we were getting up to leave, a person came by with a dish that said happy birthday and had 2 biscotti\"s , a cookie, a salted chocolate thingy and a lit candle.

Would have went better with a cappuccino but the check was already paid. 

This was a disappointing experience, even more so because I wanted it to be special for my wife's 40th. She liked the complimentary bread.....

If I can say something positive and relative, I would recommend going to D.O.C G. instead. Same Chef, different menu. Been there 5 times and loved it."}
{"text":"Staff are really nice! Ordered beef carpaccio w/ truffles, veal, mushrooms, some pasta etc...

Once we got the food we just had a little taste of everything then just took everything for take out. 

I definitely did not like the mushroom. Beef carpaccio w/ truffles is the only thing I liked w/ what we ordered. Spent more than $300 for something we didn't like :(

We liked the complimentary bread more than our actual dinner."}
{"text":"I ate at Scarpettas with two of my friends.   I would have given it a 4, but the service was poor.  You go to a place like this expecting excellent service.   I think our server took our order and dropped the bill off and that was about it.  The poor bus boy was stuck answering our questions,  taking drink orders.  He had to run and ask a server for some answers.   The food was good, just there is so many choices in Vegas."}
{"text":"This will become one of my go-to Vegas restaurants! I read the reviews on the spaghetti and yes, it's probably the most unassuming this on the menu, but for sure the BEST spaghetti I've ever had!! It would be hard for me to order anything else on the menu, yet there are so many more things I want to try. And dessert. Get dessert. The Nutella and vanilla italian donuts were amazing. I could have eaten a plate of those for dinner.
They have a very extensive wine list, but it is all pretty pricey for a bottle. A bottle of Oyster Bay Pinot Noir was $84. I don't mind paying for a good wine but Oyster Bay is far from worth $84. However, we did find a nice bottle for $115. But their wine list ranged from $84 to about $8000. So there is something for almost everyone."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. Great food the portions are a little small. I would not recommend getting a salad because the menu has many so many other options. I did get the New York  steak and it was a good size portion. Great meal and good wine. Overall the experience the friendly staff really get a five star."}
{"text":"I dined at Scarpetta this past Saturday night.  We arrived 20 minutes early for our reservation and were seated right away.  I loved the atmosphere. Quiet with smooth hits from the 80s playing in the backround. 

The service was great and our server was very knowledgeable about the food and wine.  He recommended a great wine based on our specifications.

I tend to judge a restaurant by their breadbasket and Scarpetta gets an A+++. Skip the Italian bread they put on top of the basket and get to the cheese and pepperoni Stromboli.  I could have left happy after that.. it was amazing! The bread comes with olive oil, whipped marscapone and a tomato type sauce. 

We started with the Scallops and beet salad.  Both were excellent.  The Scallops ( 2 good sized scallops) were cooked perfectly.  The beet salad was nothing super fancy but I knew that when I ordered it.

My parents both opted for meatier entrees- Dad the veal chop and mom the NY strip.  My moms meat was slightly undercooked but she opted not to send it back to be cooked more.. Both were excellent.  I had heard so much about the Spaghetti that I decided to try that.  It was the best spaghetti I had ever had so it is definitely worth trying if you want a pasta dish.

For dessert we go the chocolate molten cake and it was the best Id ever had! The salted caramel sauce was a nice touch.  

I'd definitely go back to Scarpetta.  I liked it better than the other Italian options I've tried in Vegas (B&B, Carnevino)."}
{"text":"This place is the best. We love this place so much, we always come here when in Vegas. We actually came two days in a row this time. The spaghetti is to die for and the braised short ribs appetizer is great. You can skip dessert here, not their strong suit, but the food is killer."}
{"text":"Excellent suggested Irish whiskey 
Beef cheek ravioli was fantastic.
Service was also very, very good."}
{"text":"Located in the Cosmopolitan, Scarpetta is a romantic Italian spot that came highly recommended to us from friends.  We were able to get an early reservation the day of for a party of two and there were several tables open when we arrived so you might be fine just walking in.  

The som helped us with a delicious bottle of wine in our price range.  To start we had the braised short rib with risotto cake and veggies.  It was a huge let down to start the meal. Think chicken pot pie down to the peas, carrots and corn. It did not match the vibe of the menu or ambiance at all and I would not recommend this dish.  I would, however, highly recommend everything else we ordered. The tagliatelle bolognese was rich and filling. The true star was the spaghetti though. I could not get over how dynamic and flavorful it was! So delicious and famous for good reason! Get this dish no matter what! And I can't pass up a dessert with amaretto in it so we split the chocolate cake with amaretto ice cream and drifted out of there blissfully content."}
{"text":"::Updated Review::

I came back to Scarpetta because I had such a wonderful experience when I first ate here.  Unfortunately, my recent visit was not as great.  Although, the ambiance is still nice and classy. 

::Drinks::
The Berry Smash was a hit but when I got it again, the flavor was different.  The alcohol was strong which was good but the drink was not as fruity.

::Food::
I got the Lardo Wrapped Prawns before and I liked it, but on this visit it was too salty.  The Prime Filet of Beef was tender but there was no \"wow\" factor.  My highlight of the night is still the Short Rib and Bone Marrow Agnolotti; it's so good!!

::Dessert::
I picked the Nutella and Vanilla Creme Bomboloni.  It was warm and fresh but nothing special.  

::Customer Service::
The customer service was superb on my first visit.  The second time around, surprisingly it was not the same.  I was a bit disappointed.

::Tips::
-Try the Short Rib and Bone Marrow Agnolotti!
-Request to sit by the window so you can watch the Bellagio Fountain Show. 
-Please read my first review for more information or if you are curious about my first visit."}
{"text":"Scott Conant would have \"Chopped\" his own restaurant last night!!  Dinner with 11 friends, reservation made weeks ago. We were seated in a location that the staff had to continually pass things over one person to another as they wasn't enough room to walk around the table to serve each person.  The apps came out in a scattered pattern and the hot ones were anything but hot!  We even had to send one back as it was downright cold.  The entrees were marginally better. They arrived with in minutes of each other! And of course they had to get one wrong!! Which took almost 15 minutes to get right and out to our table! The $50+ steak, that was recommended and ordered medium rare came out medium well.  The veal chop that I ordered medium rare came out medium and obviously had been sitting on the pass line as it was room temperature at best.  When we explained the continuos problems to the Manager/sommelier he response was these things happen. Well these people will not happen to be going back to Scarpetta.  In a town with hundreds of choices that go out of their way to make your dining experience enjoyable, this one should be Chopped off your list!"}
{"text":"Have I known that this place was known for its spaghetti then I would have gotten it. I just can't see paying $15-25 for spaghetti. 

But the atmosphere of this restaurant is hip & modern-like the hotel itself. Our waiter was super friendly and gave us great service as well as the bussers and host. I ordered the blackened cod and my BF ordered the veal, ick..I don't know what veal is supposed to taste like since I haven't had it before but I tasted it and didn't like it. But my blackened cod was really good and we ordered the seared yellow tail for an appe-teaser! OMG, it was the best I have ever tasted, I highly recommend this! It had a lemon nutty flavor that just melt in my mouth! So good!! 

And they give you bread before your meal, yummy, they had different varieties that you can choose from and trust me all of them are good! 

Definitely would go back but going to try the spaghetti next time.."}
{"text":"I been to the Scarpetta in Beverly Hills, was a bit disappointed in the food there but decided to give this one a try.

GOOD CHOICE! I loved the venue, on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo, mid dark light very elegant, though it is a bit more crowded due to the small space, but the bar area is very cute.

We got 4 diff appetizers, beet salad, pork belly, scallops and Beef I liked them all

Then 4 entrees: black cod, foie gras ravioli, diff meats ravioli and i forgot the last one! but again it was delicious, the black cod melts in your mouth!

Different we got an apple pie sort with ice cream and raspberries.

Def coming out here again next time  invegas. Cosmo is just beautiful and elegant hotel very modern, but trying STK next time"}
{"text":"I had dinner here the other night and went in with moderate expectations and closed the evening happy, and smiling from ear to ear. 


Atmosphere =  fantastic. We had a table for 2 with a view of the Bellagio Fountains. 

Service = excellent. The waiter was amazing and started us off with a delicious glass of wine.  My friend and I told him what kind of wine we liked; a heavy red. He brought an amazing glass that was delicious. I don't recall the name, but It was a blend from Santa Barbara and exactly what we wanted. 

Food = delicious. I couldn't make my mind up and asked the waiter for a suggestion between 3 pasta dishes I was considering. His suggestion was the Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti.  I've never had \"bone marrow\" anything, but I was willing to give it a try. I ate every piece and nearly licked the plate.  What I respected the most? The waiter wasn't trying to sell me on the most expensive dish. In fact, it was one of the less expensive pasta dishes to choose from! 

Desert = Heavenly & Sinful. I am not a \"sweets / desert person,so I \"passed\" on ordering a desert. My friend ordered a desert that were like cream filled donuts. The waiter brought me out a tiny little spoon to \"taste\" the desert or was teasing me.  He ended up bringing me a full on desert spoon! Delicious! 

Not too expensive. Great ambiance, fantastic customer service and delicious food. I will def return and suggest Scarpetta. ;-))))"}
{"text":"It was hard to give this place 2 stars as the food was DELICIOUS!  The location is awesome and we had a great table by the window.  The view is great.  The service was horrible.  They were having some computer problems.  It would have been great if the server came and explained that to us, instead he just disappeared and I guess was trying to fix it.  I am not a needy diner by any means, however, our wine glasses were empty for a while (which we spent $70 per glass for), we would have ordered dessert but it just took too long.  It was almost like we were forgotten.  Spending almost $300 for 2 people should get you AMAZING service."}
{"text":"My sister asked me to find a good place to have pre-Christmas dinner with our Mom in Las Vegas and I actually found Scarpetta by searching for top rated restaurants near the strip with foie gras. Seriously. I need my foie gras.

With the recent foie gras ban in California keeping me from one of my favorite delicacies, I definitely wanted to have it if I was crossing state lines.  Scarpetta stuck out to me because it wasn't a French restaurant, but an Italian one, which is my Mom's favorite... and a great way for everyone to be happy.

Scarpetta was perfect. Situated in the new and beautiful Cosmopolitan hotel, it has an amazing view of the Bellagio and definitely has that upscale \"we are dining somewhere really fancy\" vibe.  The server was really enthusiastic about the dishes and described them each eloquently (I read one person's review that found this annoying, but I thought it was great!) and helped with recommendations for what to order.

Starter:

POLENTA with Mushrooms. Oh. My God. To DIE FOR. Seriously.  Wow.  Best dish of the night and that's saying a lot because everything was great.

Mains:

Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli - Obviously what I ordered and obviously I loved it.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the portion size. Usually when you order ravioli you get like, 4, and are left being hungry, but not in this case. It was a generous portion.  I would have loved there to be more foie gras but that's just being greedy.

Fennel Spiced Black Cod - My mom ordered this and it was probably the least interesting thing that we had, but still delicious.

Black Tonarelli - My sister ordered this and it was also amazing, al dente, just as it should be.  It took about 10 minutes to come out after the rest of the dishes and they kept apologizing profusely for it and then sent out TWO free desserts to make up for it.

(FREE!) Desserts:

Mascarpone Cheesecake - lighter than your average cheesecake, which made me like it more.

Amaedi Chocolate Cake - like a lava cake, but better.. the perfect texture / consistency with hot melted chocolate inside... served with almond ice cream...

This was one of the best Italian meals I've ever had outside of Italy,  and I've tried all of those overrated high end Italian restaurants in Los Angeles. I was expecting much less, thinking this was a bit of a tourist trap that I was buying into for the evening. It ended up being so much more. I was so pleasantly surprised and happy with the experience. Also, no BS portion sizes.. these are hearty portions and you will leave full.

Definitely one of my top (if not the top) Italian restaurants outside Italy.  I just may need to go visit the Scarpetta in LA."}
{"text":"I came here just for desserts, so my review is based solely off of that. We actually came here twice just for dessert despite having other dessert places to check off on my 4 day trip to Vegas. We liked it that much. I am a huge huge coconut fan, give me anything coconut and I'll have to try it. With both their cheesecake and their panna cotta having that coconut element, I absolutely had to indulge. The panna cotta is absolutely divine, the base is coconut and it's layered with a \"guava soup\" - the dessert is totally an experience. Now the cheesecake, the cheesecake was just unforgettable we loved the mango sorbet that accompanied the cheesecake to counter the sweetness, it was the perfectly balanced dessert - needless to say we devoured the whole thing."}
{"text":"Bravo to scarpetta for an excellent dinner this past weekend.  We were lucky enough to sit at the \"chef's table\" and we had a clear view of the kitchen at work.  We even heard the chef shout out orders like hell's kitchen: One risotto, two spaghettis; we had a party of 9 for a birthday and they treated us like kings.  The waiter Titus was an amazing help and made the meal excellent.  The food that was prepared was spot on! I had the world-renowned plate of goodness known as the spaghetti, but let me tell you this is not your typical pasta dish.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the infusion of fresh tomato and basil all concentrated into the smooth pasta was a burst of flavor in my mouth.  For my appetizer i had the polenta that \"has been stewing in the kitchen prepared by grandma for three hours.\" It was amazing; the best polenta i have had topped off with a truffle sauce mixture with mushrooms.  For dessert, I recommend the panna cotta, like i say a great panna cotta's consistency should jiggle like a nice woman's bosom and this dish jiggled perfectly.  The melt in your mouth dessert with a hint of coconut was a perfect end to a grand evening.  GO here and try it over and over again because the spaghetti is addictive."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food and house made pasta--the only way to enjoy Italian food. Scarpetta was a lovely experience. The duck foie gras ravioli was great but the stand out was definitely the spaghetti--cooked to perfection. The orata (branzino) was nicely done, too. While I'd pass on the chocolate cake which tasted a bit generic, my favorite of the night was the pana cotta--delicious! The service was decent--slightly snobby but it comes with the territory. I'd love to dine here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I could not wait to dine at Scarpetta in Las Vegas after having a perfect evening at the Scarpetta Miami months prior. Unfortunately the service at this location is so disappointing.  Our greeting was frazzled and rushed, our seat was lovely looking at the fountains nice and private. Our server from first greeting had an awful attitude-rather snotty really and never shared his name. Our food was absolutely perfect but our overall experience was ruined by lack of service here. I specifically said I would like wine with my dinner as my last experience in Miami was heightened by the perfectly selected glass of wine by the charming sommelier.  Here our glasses were left empty our entire meal!  My husband had finished his cocktail before the appetizer!  When dinner arrived we were over half finished before our server asked if everything was fine.  Clearly this was disappointing which then caused us to decide to not have another drink nor coffee and dessert as we had hoped.  When we asked for the check the server asked if there was something wrong which was frustrating and we chose to not bother as it seemed that could be confrontational. 
Again, our food was perfect it was just a completely different feel than expected-one I would not want to repeat."}
{"text":"Went in on Sat night and felt like I was in Rome the food was that good.  Wow!  Tremendous experience.  The service is probably the best we've had in Vegas, they're that talented.  And the pasta is really that good!  I strongly recommend it here.  Mario the GM came over to see how our meal was which shows how caring their team is.   I noticed as walking out they have a really nice private dinning room for special partys that faces the water show at Belligiao..."}
{"text":"Fine dining at it's finest!

Came here a Saturday night during my last trip to Vegas for a bachelorette party (apparently we weren't the only ones) and we were seated right in the middle on a long table which was nice for a party of 7 girls. Our waiter and busers were on point and our waiter was really nice and always conversated with us and made our experience fab!

Let's talk about that bread basket...how crazy is it that they actually have salami in one of the breads. They also have sourdough and herb focaccia  . They have butter, olive oil and this roasted tomato eggplant as a spread to go with the variety of bread they give. I liked the herb focaccia bread the best with the butter...it was toasted and soft in a small square (good for portion size). For my meal I got the black cod with tomato's and fennel because I love butterfish and I only eat seafood and I love vegetables...although I was debating on getting this or the halibut, I'm glad I went with this because it was so divine! I wish the portion was bigger but it's one of those restaurants where it's quality over quantity. We ordered 2 whites and 1 bottle of reds that night, and because my stomach was not having it, I only drank a glass of the 1st bottle. Some of the girls ordered the lobster, scallop appetizers, split pea soup, foi Gras ravioli and steak and everyone said everything they ordered was great. For desserts we got the hazelnut mini donuts, strawberry cheesecake/shortcake in a cup dessert over a bed of crystallized sugar...I didn't get to try any of them but everything was all gone so it must've been delicious. 


Overall the ambiance is beautiful, food is amazing/drinks and bread, awesome service and fine dining at it's finest. The portions are a little small and the price is a little pricey but worth it especially when it's a special occasion like a birthday, anniversary, valentines day, mothers day or bachelorette dinner =)"}
{"text":"I had wanted to dine at Scarpetta since I first laid eyes on Scott Conant via Chopped. The man is downright foxy. My favorite food happens to be pasta too, so clearly it was meant to be. 

Located in the swanky Cosmopolitan hotel, the first thing you see are cascades of chandeliers and purple backlights throughout the main floor. The restaurant itself is dimly lit with lots of stone and dark accents creating a chic yet inviting space. 

I suggest making reservations (we did so through Open Table) and also be sure to ask for a window table if available. Those have a clear view of the strip and Bellagio fountains. Sadly they were all taken the night we went, but they sat us as close as they could so we still had a nice view from our seats. 

They start your meal off with a complimentary bread basket, and we enjoyed the variety of it. There was sourdough, a rosemary focaccia, I believe a wheat of some kind, and two which were stuffed with goodness including pesto and cheese. Spread on some mascarpone butter or dunk in the citrus olive oil and it completely elevates it to another level. 

My husband couldn't help himself and ordered another after we devoured it. They obliged, but seemed surprised by the request. I'm guessing not many people ask for refills. We are carb people, what can we say? 

I knew ahead of time I would be ordering the $24 plate of tomato and basil spaghetti, and it was worth every penny. I'm almost certain I read he doesn't use cream in the sauce, but he sure fooled me because it was deliciously silky. When they set our plates down they removed a lid which had sealed in steam to keep the pasta fresh, and the aroma automatically made us salivate. It was the sexiest plate of pasta I had ever seen and tasted in my life. 

My husband opted for a vegetable pasta which came dressed in a luxurious truffle zabaglione. When it comes to Italian food he almost always picks a meat dish over pasta, but he ate every last bite. 

Our dinner was simply impeccable. My expectations were well exceeded and I cannot wait to make a return visit. The staff are wonderfully hospitable and helped make our evening that much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas over the 4th of July weekend with some friends and family. We decided to give Scarpetta a try since it sounded nice and was close to our hotel. The restaurant is beautiful and the wait staff was great (very friendly, polite and professional). The view from the restaurant is on the Bellagio fountains, which was very nice (you actually get a nice panoramic view of part of the strip). As for the food, I was pleasantly surpised. I had the duck foie gras ravioli and it was quite nice. My girlfriend had the Pici pasta which was absolutely amazing! If you are in Vegas and looking to have a nice dinner I would say head over to Scarpetta."}
{"text":"Recently had dinner here. Reservation at 7:30, seated at 8:10. Staff unapologetic. Limited choice, small portions, food mediocre,expensive.
The room was so dark, we needed a flashlight to read the menu. I definitely will not return."}
{"text":"I had heard about Scarpetta multiple times on Travel Channel (Anthony Bourdain) and Food Network (Best Thing I ever Ate).  Scott Conant is also a celebrity chef that is on some Food Network shows.  I happened to be at a conference at the Cosmopolitan (my new favorite hotel in Vegas, BTW), and I figured I might as well stop by and try out the food at Scarpetta.

The inside of the restaurant has a good view of the faux lake at the Bellagio.  Big windows and a nice decor are the first thing you notice.  The food is what we were really there for, so I was excited about that.  For appetizer, we ordered duck and foie gras ravioli's with a wine reduction sauce.  This was just amazing....heavy and rich, but it is foie gras, so you should expect that.  Since it was a regular menu item and not an appetizer, they split it in half for my co-worker and I.

Upon receiving the raviolis, our server (who was very good....attentive and knowledgable) brought over a basket of 3 breads.  One was ciabatta, one was a focaccia (or something similar) with pork (prosciutto, maybe?) and cheese rolled into it.  I can't remember the third bread, but it was also good.

Next up was the main meal.  I ordered the spaghetti (with tomato and basil), and my co-worker ordered the branzino.  The spaghetti is what I had seen featured multiple times on TV, and I am always a skeptic.  I didn't think it could possibly be the best spaghetti I had ever had, but I was wrong.  This spaghetti was the absolute best I have ever had.  There was so much flavor concentrated on FRESH pasta.  Every bite was heaven, and for $24, I would order it again for sure.  Vegas (and NY) are both expensive for nice restaurants, so the price tag is high compared to your local favorite Italian place, but the pasta just isn't the same.

My co-workers branzino was also excellent.  Served with some greens and onion, it was cooked perfectly (crispy skin), and the flavor was very fresh.  

I can't say enough about this restaurant.  I highly recommend anyone going to the Cosmopolitan check this place out.  Definitely one of my better dining experiences for Italian food."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Our waiter was a pompous jerk who came back to our table twice until our bill was due and then he was back every two minutes even though our wine wasn't finished. The manager came to the two tables next to us and offered free wine and said nothing to us. Very disappointing considering we are huge Scott fans."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas last weekend for a birthday, and as Chopped fans we had to go. We spent the week prior drooling over the menu but that didn't help, we were still having a hard time choosing what to order. So many great options!

I went with the Pici while the bf went with the Prime Fillet. The Pici was spicy and unbelievably delicious. The Fillet was tender and probably the best piece of meat I've ever put in my mouth. 

Scarpetta has ruined Italian food for me. Pasta is freshly handmade. I'm getting an Imperia and never eating pasta out of a box again."}
{"text":"Scarpetta fits well in the sophisticated Cosmopolitan Hotel. Tucked away into a corner, this restaurant is unassuming at first approach. The lights are dim and there are curvy booths on the right side facing a long bar. The walkway is narrow but keep the eye on the prize at the end because that's where the true \"meat\" of the restaurant is. Tables and booths are snugly placed in a modern yet cozy dining area. For our group of 10, the broad shouldered guys probably felt a little too close for comfort to make room for all of us to fit, but it wasn't a problem for the girls. 

Last Saturday, we were in a mad rush to eat and run because we were trying to catch a 9:30pm showing of KA at MGM. Our dinner reservation was 7:30pm so we cut it close. We asked the waiter to divide our check between 5 couples and to make things worse, we did not sit next to our significant others. We brushed off the sommelier by accident because we wanted to find our waiter just to order right away. In spite of our group being a nightmare, they made our plans happen and with time to boot! The food was amazing, our checks were split perfectly, and the waiter even offered detailed directions how to get to our show quicker. 

The duck fois gras ravioli and the short rib agnolotti were the two dishes my husband and I shared. We loved these dishes. The guys in our group ordered steaks which were all well prepared and the girls ordered appetizers and a couple dishes to share but I think Bry and I were the happiest out of the group with our choices, which is surprising because I always choose steak over anything. 

Looking back, I feel bad that we put the staff in a position where everything needed to be rushed but overall, our entire group was impressed with the food and service. Thanks Scarpetta for that!"}
{"text":"This place left such an impact that I almost went back to my room to write a Yelp! OMG I just finished writing and realize no one in their right mind will ever read this- it's an essay!

Just got back from an impromptu b-day trip from Las Vegas. Had an amazing time w the guy and the memorable meal of the trip was a b-day dinner at Scarpetta- great recommendation from a friend.

Everything here is phenomenal but I want to start w the service. Mathew our server,  was cordial, friendly & extremely informative. The table next door said he was Captain Morgan come to life but he reminded us of a younger refined Gary Oldman mixed w someone else. :)

One thing I really appreciate in any server is someone that shares their experiences w various dishes and points you in the direction you want to go. We filled him in on the 3 dishes we knew we wanted and he put real thought into helping us choose the final dish. Not only that, he was exceptionally personable; and we had great small talk- always love that.

Alright to the review and apologize in advance for the blabbering!

To Start: 
An unassuming covered basket of bread is left on the table. On the outside is an inconspicuous piece of sliced sourdough on top... nothing special right?
I'm thinking \"PASS trying to cut carbs!\"
Surprise!!! 2 types of STROMBOLI (I believe it was Pesto/Cheese and Salami or a Tasso Ham and Cheese) and fresh rosemary cibatta inside. Proceed to annihilate entire basket.

We ended up sharing everything we ordered so they portioned out everything for us, it was perfect and presentation was beautiful. 

Starters:
Vancouver Island Oysters: Fresh Oysters, enough said.

Dungeness Crab and White Corn Soup: My rule of thumb is to always order soup if it's on the menu and isn't a house soup. I've been unsuccessful in making a solid corn soup, leave it to the professionals I say! This was the perfect, hot, super creamy, flavor filled soup I wish to one day master. The corn scent wafted into your nose as the base was poured over the  chunks of crab, table side. I definitely conjured Toucan Sam (corn soup version) for a second.

Pici: (pronounced peachy like the folders) 
Homemade pasta sort of like a thicker fettuccine noodle on steroids. Parsley and other goodies are blended in the flour which adds a green hue and extra umph. It comes w lobster and a taragon, almond and chili pesto. I'm not a huge pesto fan but luckily for me it's not a traditional pesto; it's not even a sauce. They give you the perfect amount to coat but not over power the dish and it has a serious kick. Very generous portion of lobster, and a staple at the restaurant. MUST TRY IT.

KOBE BEEF RIB CAP: This was $68, on our last trip to Vegas we had the Japanese Waygu at Cut which I think has permanently changed my views on the price of steak.
This was 7 oz and extremely rich, barely needed a knife, and it just melted in your mouth. It came w potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms & a reduction that is seriously making my mouth water in retrospect.

Peach Costata: Salted Shortbread covered w Cardamon ice cream and chunks of peach. It was a spicy dessert (take note if that's not your thing) that complimented our decaf cappuccino's! The decaf cap's were suggested by Mathew when we originally ordered just decaf coffee. Great suggestion, paired perfect w the dessert.

Oh MAN 2 things I left out- 
I had a dirty martini w blue cheese filled olives; holy goodness; i hope i can order this at other places.

Lastly; we were here on the 4th of July; right when we were paying Mathew mentioned we could wait because the fireworks at Caesar's were starting in 10 minutes. They allowed us to stay and watch for 30+ mins (late start) even though the restaurant was filling up. I thought that was really nice of them (they didn't even know it was my bday!) haha and there was no rush to get us out the door.

Taking into account service, ambiance and quality I put this in my top 3 best dining experiences ever :) also you can  tell I loved the service considering I mentioned the server by name 3x in the post!? Foie Gras Ravioli, you're next!"}
{"text":"Scott Conant's place in the Cosmo is really nice and the food is delicious. The service was first class, I felt like I was aboard the titanic, haha. The waiter knew his shit and helped me and my buddies pair our dishes perfectly with some wines, and we're not quite wine guys, but we all enjoyed it. The desert, chocolate cake, was so rich and delicious and the caramelized almond sorbet made it. Eat here and smile . Thanks place."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and very good view of Bellagio fountains.  Food was too salty the first time but very good the second time."}
{"text":"Made a reservation three weeks before dining here and requested a table with a view of the Bellagio fountain.  We came 15 minutes early and we're seated away from the window.   I noticed an open table next to the window and requested to be moved there.  The hostess informed us that the table was not ready and that it was already reserved.   Really?  Sure... Bad start to the evening. .."}
{"text":"Chef Dave was amazing!! The food was delicious! We went there for a bachelorette party and thanks to Bex for being able to get us seats at the chefs table! If you ever plan on going to vegas please ask for Bex!!"}
{"text":"I might as well start with the one thing that the restaurant got right: service. Everything else was a disaster.

Let's start with the menu. I am still trying to figure out how they came up with this menu. Did they Google \"fancy Italian menu\"? Did they copy Olive Garden's and just add in some more fancy ingredients? One will never know. What I do know, however, is that a 44 ounce steak is probably not something one eats in Italy. I'm also pretty sure vegetable medley and dishes served with only a starch are not something I've ever seen in a fine dining establishment.

Now, let's move on to the food: the absolute worst part of the evening. I ordered the osso buco, which I'll understate as absolutely disgusting. The tomato sauce was sour, watery, and lacked any flavor or complexity whatsoever. The veal shank was dry and not seasoned at all. The polenta had no flavor and was covered in bland cheese. Had my server brought me Pizza Hut instead, it would have been an upgrade.

If somehow Cosmo could move the excellent servers to another one of their restaurants and then bulldoze the daylights out of the disaster that is Scarpetta, the world would be a better place. Save yourself the money and eat at the many restaurants in Las Vegas that are actually good."}
{"text":"After visiting Scarpetta in LA, I cannot wait to see what the Vegas one has to offer. They serve the same menu but the ambiance there is totally different. The Vegas one has a gorgeous view of Bellagio's fountain and the decor is more old, rustic and not as classy and glamorous as the LA one. The waiter here is very helpful and funny. 
 
The food here is delicious:

+ Beef Tartare: Cooked with lime juice so quite sour but refreshing. Very different from traditional beef tartare.
+ Raw Yellowtail: It's okay. Pretty typical, but I'm surprise how non-fatty the fish taste considering hamachi is a fattier fish.
+ The spaghetti: good as always--al dente with a sauce that's sweet with a hint of tang. 
+ Tagliatelle: A pasta with spring veggies. This tasted too green and peas-filled for me. The cream sauce also too thick. 
+ Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli: This was delicious but the foie gras taste is very mild. 
+ Mediterranean Branzino: The fish has a really, really nice sear on the outside and it was very soft and tasty. 

Don't skip dessert! Dessert was phenomenal! 

+ Strawberry Tart : The tart crust was amazing! It has that crunch and the cream was so light. The meringue that came with the dessert didn't taste like basil as described, but it was still really good. 

+and the Nutella & Vanilla Creme Bomboloni: Reminds me of hot bigne with creamy nutty chocolate center! It's so good. And I have no idea how they caramelized a banana. It has the crunch and then creaminess of the fruit."}
{"text":"OHHH, Scarpetta, why do you have to be soooooo good? After this weekend and the amazing service we had from Travis. All I can do is dream about my dinner. WHATTT? You can order meatballs on your crack spaghetti? Hell yesss and if you think you loved the spitball than, wait till you have them with these tiny little meatballs. Now, I have a new addiction.. THE HALIBUT! WTH??? and the scallops! Talk about not eating much seafood, but Friday night I was seeing a lot of SEAFOOD and loving it! By the time I had a drink called the Smashing Blush and some other specialty drink with whiskey, yup, you heard me... WHISKEY, I guess I was blushing smashed. Overall, service and food was impeccable and the desserts, were enough for me to think about not taking the leftover few strands of spaghetti back to my hotel room. Now, THANK GOD I did, since after my Pitbull Concert and another cocktail from the show, I stumbled in my room hungry and hungover and cold spaghetti at 12:00 AM, was still delicious!"}
{"text":"Very high priced, semi-Italian fusion type of food.

Some really good fish dishes, try the halibut from the meat menu.

Definitely gotta make a reservation in advance. 

if you're a party of 6 or more, request to be seated in their private room with a view of the Bellagio fountains water show."}
{"text":"Ate here last week when I went into Vegas for a concert. My friends truffle pasta was delish and hot. I got the Al Ceppo and it wasn't anything fabulous. My food actually came out barely room temperature. I don't think they had it sitting under the salamander considering my friends Truffle pasta was piping hot. I was told their entrees were small and I should order two meals or a salad so I did. The salad I ordered was pretty tasty. I do think it's all overpriced. Not worth the money spent although I heard their basil spaghetti was really good. The complimentary bread with salami was delish with the eggplant! Must say tastiest bread I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"This place was a total joke! We go out for dinner frequently and love to try new places.  We sat for over 15 minutes without even being acknowledged and finally left. No one even bothered to ask why we were leaving and staff were just standing around. What a waste of a good location in Inglewood! We then wandered down to The Ironwood to grab a drink and try to figure out where to go for dinner and had a great time! Amazing service, awesome staff. Highly recommend them. Don't even waste your time at 500 Cucina aka Scarpettas."}
{"text":"We had great seating next to the windows viewing the Bellagio fountains as requested.
The food was much better presented and tasteful than other Italian restaurants I've visited in LV.

The bread basket is delightful with the trio of accompaniments: marscapone butter, Eggplant in tomato ragu and citrus infused oil.  For appetizer we had the creamy polenta. Enough for one or two to share as it is extremely rich as a separate duo of perfectly creamed polenta and truffled mushrooms. If you haven't already gobbled up your breads, make useful tool to sweep up the last juices.
Three of us got the black cod which is superbly moist and light with a crisp skin, but the vegetables (fennel/peppers) were a bit too sour to match with.  And the other three got the duck foie gras ravioli which was rich and poignant with flavor but not unpleasant. The balsamic glaze was apparent and not overwhelming. I would have finished the entire plate.  

Why the three stars? LACK of consistent service :(
I don't include the guy who kept our water glasses filled. But we were all (party of 6) sourly disappointed with the main waiter. He only presented himself to take our order and serve the appetizer.  Didn't even refilled our breads as asked.  Then with empty plates, we all sat there for 15 minutes watching our server chummy up with a table of 3 girls and another table drinking it up with ample wine bottles. An assistant manager in a suit, bless him, came over, asked how our dinner was, saw our plates and decided to clear our table himself and also bring us our check.
Although we weren't completely dissatisfied with the whole dining experience, it's just unsettling when the server is MIA with you and present elsewhere. 
So, maybe next time. If there is a next time."}
{"text":"Great view, good food, we had family style, and we were a bit hurried, but the service was great, and the food was good, Im not sure I gave it a full run through, as we were headed out for the night, the service was good, its small and can feel a little crowded, but overall, id try it again.   I did NOT dig the Cosmopolitan Hotel, we went to my friends suite, and it was unimpressive, and the night club scene was for a bunch of wannabee 23 yr olds."}
{"text":"Modern decor, nice view looking over Bellagio'd fountain on the window side. 
Service was great, food was good but not that high as I expected. Daily special linguini was good but salty. If saltiness of this dish was perfect, it could be the best dish of the day. Signature tomato home made spaghetti , fresh pasta was great but again the tomato sauce was heavy because of butter I guess.  If you're looking for authentic Italian, this is not a place to go."}
{"text":"Picture four girls who have been drinking all day downstairs at the Marquee Day Club, starved out of their minds. Not really the way I imagined myself dining for the first time at the famous Scarpetta, but hey, at least I was ready to eat.

We crawled in in our flip flops and denim shorts right when the restaurant opened. The tables were already all booked (at 6pm!), but they have some nice booth seats by the bar. 

First off, the complimentary bread. My god. Warm and chewy, stuffed with sausage or spinach and cheese, with olive oil for dipping. We had to get a second round of this, it was so fantastic. 

We also shared four pastas:
- spaghetti (with tomato and basil, that's it!)
- duck & foie gras ravioli
- pici (with lobster, tarragon, almond & chili pesto)
- short rib & bone marrow agnolotti (the toasted breadcrumbs added such a fabulous texture and crunch!)

All the dishes were phenomenal, but the spaghetti was by far my favorite. Typically spaghetti doesn't do it for me, but now that I know what it's supposed to taste like, I've changed my mind. So simple, yet so delicious. It was cooked perfectly al dente, and so rich and full of flavor I didn't even miss the creaminess (or cheesiness) of other pastas. 

A MUST-VISIT IF YOU'RE EVER IN VEGAS!"}
{"text":"There's no word that describes Scarpetta better than perfect. The decor is inviting, and cozy while still giving that \"Las Vegas feel\". 

The service was prompt and the food was excellent. Every dish we ordered was fresh and full of flavor. I ordered the short rib pasta which was absolutely delicious. 

I absolutely recommend to anyone looking for a memorable dinner in LV."}
{"text":"For our last night in Vegas, we were looking to splurge a bit for our dinner out. I got super excited when I learned this is one of Scott Conant's restaurants because I love Italian food and I see him on Chopped all the time.

The restaurant is located on the third floor, just take the escalators up near Marquee and Chandelier. I made reservations using open table for 10 pm (a bit late, but we just got drinks in Chandelier beforehand) and were seated shortly after 10 at a table near the windows. We could see the Bellagio and the watershow - very nice view.

First off, the bread basket and the toppings for it were so good! A butter marscapone, eggplant, and olive oil were provided to go with the different breads. There was a sourdough and some other types, but my favorite was this bread with mozzarella baked into it. And, I don't even like eggplant, but my favorite bread topping was the eggplant - it was that yummy.

Based on other reviews and what sounded good to us, my friend and I ordered the polenta to start, which was split into two separate dishes for us. Amazingly tasty. I have to say I haven't had polenta before, but I figured this would be a good place to try it, and boy was that a good decision. It was just so creamy with a little bit of a gritty texture, but mmmmm. I don't know how else to describe it.

For my entree I had the tagliatelle with vegetables, guanciale, and truffle zabaglione - housemade pasta! Another very mmmmmm dish. My tastebuds were happy. And for dessert, I had the coconut panna cotta with guava \"soup\". Perfect end to the meal since it was lighter, fresher, and sweet. 

All in all, I thought the food was great and I would consider coming back if I was splurging a bit. Only thing I didn't really care for was the bathroom. There was only one stall for women and it wasn't that great, and my friend said there was a line of about 6 women when she went. I would expect a nice restaurant to have a nicer bathroom."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Scarpetta a couple weeks ago with friends.  The ambiance of the place was nice. Service was excellent and the sommelier was great with his suggestions of wines.  Had a very nice refreshing wine from Cake Bread which went well with our meal.

I gave this place a 3 stars only because the food was ok.. it was good.. but not great.  Perhaps I was expecting it to be a bit better based on the previous reviews from other yelpers (ie. going in with too high expectations).  Don't get me wrong, it was a nice dinner.  Just not as great as what I anticipated it to be..

Don't think I would go back as there are plenty of other great restaurants in Vegas for italian.

Peace out.."}
{"text":"The best view on the strip for a romantic dinner facing the Bellagio's water show.  The only minor detail that could have made it much better was the structural beam that went right across us at eye level.  Apparently the space was originally designed to be the kitchen and not the main dining room.

Anyway, the food, the meal, the experience.  We did the tasting menu which was AMAZING & EXPENSIVE but AMAZING!  To wrap it up in a nutshell we enjoyed duck, fish, scallop, shoe string calamari & zucchini, polenta with a mushroom broth, tomato basil spaghetti (famous on FoodTV), & decadent warm chocolate cake and delightful peach soupy thing for dessert. Yes!  All of that in one meal.  I almost needed a wheelchair just to get out of there.

Our server was so attentive and the wines that were paired with each dish was just perfect.  Heaven.  Enough said."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite splurge dinner places in Vegas. My friend and I came here during our annual girls weekend. We are both big fans of eating out so we were very excited to come here. Our waiter was very attentive and we did not feel like we had to get his attention to order or get our check. One of the things I love about dining here is that they have one of the most extensive and delicious bread baskets ever (4 types of bread and 3 spread/dips). 

As for the food and drinks, we ordered a nice bottle of sauvignon blanc which was reasonably priced compared to their cocktail prices. We shared the polenta to start, which the restaurant kindly split between 2 bowls for us, which was a very nice gesture. For our entrées we shared the short rib agnolotti and the black fettuccini. Both dishes were delicious. However, the short rib agnolotti was clearly the stand out and probably my favorite dish here. On a past visit, I have also ordered their spaghetti which sounds plain but is super flavorful. 

We were pretty full and did not order dessert, but based on a prior visit, I highly recommend the bomboloni."}
{"text":"One of the most over priced Italian restaurants I've experienced. The portions were miniscule while the prices were stratospheric. The quality was so-so. My raviolis were so dry they were hard to swallow. The gingerbread desert was unremarkable for $11. Pasta dishes were in the $20-30. Better make sure there is a McDonald's in the area to hit after this dinner!!!!"}
{"text":"i came here in a large group, and we got the private room in the back.  we had a minimum we had to meet, which i don't think was difficult.  we got a set menu w/ 4 courses.  all the courses were served family style except for the entree.  

for the first course, there was a really tasty tomato salad and a polenta w/ mushrooms.  there was also a beef and farro dish, but i didn't taste that. 

for the second course, there were 2 pastas:  the signature spaghetti, and a  tagliatelle w/ peas and guaciale.  both pastas were delicious, but i preferred the taglatelle.

my entree was the cod, which was fine but nothing to write home about.  there was also a steak option.

there were 3 desserts:  a choc cake w/ salted caramel, apple tart, and a coconut cream thing in a guava/pineapple soup.  the choc cake and apple tart were amazing.  

everyone also raved about the stromboli bread.  drinks here were good too.  i'd come back to dine in the main restaurant next time."}
{"text":"So much potential here, the experience was really 3 star but I'm optimistic.

Great layout with large S-curved bank seating and a nice north facing view of the Bellagio fountain. Service is great but the kitchen timing needs work. Food came out a bit slow and a bit cold which is normally a big time no-no but they are new and working out the kinks.

Food is delicious, apps of short ribs and polenta truffles with mushrooms make for a great start. Polenta was creamy and truffle accents were spot on. 

Pastas are house-made and cooked just al-dente. Easy to do but somehow few places get it right. The spaghetti with creamy tomato and basil, just perfect, a great representation of Italian food in its simplistic goodness. Black cod done well, cooked nicely. 

Duck and foie gras ravioli was a bit salty and cold and the agnolotti seemed too one dimensional. Both were slightly warm and would have been better paired with a side. Plates seemed a bit bare.

Desserts-  very creative. Napoleon-  deconstructed creme brulee with blood oranges, sweet and creamy, amazing combination. 

Nutella warm molten chocolate bites with hazelnuts were also deliciously comforting. 

Overall, given the lack of decent Italian eateries with value on the Strip, it's worth a visit. Once they get the timing down, the kitchen and the service make this a sure-bet for a quality meal."}
{"text":"Headed over to 500 Cucina for pizza night to try a new place.  The lighting was bright; there were TVs.  I don't know, I just can't get excited about this place.  I'm writing this review a few months after dining here and I can't remember anything about the food.  I'm sure I had pizza and it was probably good but the lighting and the TVs are all I can remember.  Maybe not a bad choice if you have a group and you're in Inglewood.  Not a great choice for date night."}
{"text":"Delicious! We weren't starving so asked the waiter to select four appetizers that we could easy split. Such a great idea! See the pictures but we had tuna roll, octopus, lobster pasta, shrimp and oysters followed by these little pastries similar to a donut stuffed with either chocolate or vanilla cream. It was a wonderful experience and our waiter was top notch!! I would definitely go back and recommend anyone else to also."}
{"text":"Late review from dinner in Feb.  

Great ambiance and view of the Bellagio fountains.   Order the duck foie gras ravioli or short rib bone marrow agnolotti.   Favors are incredible!   Even the bread basket is amazing.   Pricey but definitely worth it.   Cosmopolitan has a great selection of restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Chopped and love Chef Scott Conant so when I heard he has two restaurants in Las Vegas I couldn't wait to try one. Let's me first share that the staff was extremely friendly and when we shared we had show reservations they were prompt and made sure we were out in time. Our table was by the window over looking the Bellagio. We had the perfect view of their water show. We asked our server what his favorite items are on the menu and he has excellent taste! Everything was simply amazing!!! From the appetizer to the pasta to the dessert. I never order spaghetti as I find it too simply but Chef Conant's is beyond amazing! It was truly the best Italian dinner I ever had!"}
{"text":"Very expensive. $24-27 for vegetarian pasta plates. However, I enjoyed my basil tomato spaghetti. The pasta are freshly made and tasted great. The bread basket and dips were delicious. The ambience is wonderful, upscale, and unique. The service was a little slow but we had a large party. The waiters were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"After reading the most recent reviews I thought it could be a little risky but the menu looked great and the ambiance was what we were looking for to take out a client.
Bummed we ended up going.  The food wasn't great and the server was rude and clearly needed to turn the table.  He literally kept returning to the table every 2 minutes until we ordered and then would stand at the table while we were in mid conversation and I stare until we stopped talking.  Not what you expect at a nice restaurant!
We ordered the $70 porterhouse which came smothered in a cheese sauce (who puts cheese on that cut of meat?!), the cod which looked like a dry pork chop when it came and was smothered in a tomato paste, and the duck which was far from tender and cam in these two huge chunks.
All in all super disappointing.  Maybe pasta is the way to go there."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this day for month.... I am back in Vegas and tonight I am having my favorite pasta ever!!! I wish I could have it twice, but was not able to get away!!!
They have the best past and polenta ever!!! I have had it twice on my last  visit and twice on my visit before! 
Black inc w uni ( plenty of it) and creamy crab is INSANE!!!!
Scarpetta, I am coming at 6pm!!!"}
{"text":"This place is swanky/trendy so prepare to spend some serious $$. It overlooks the Bellagio fountains which is pretty cool. 
The service is extremely well-trained and professional. 
We started off not ordering drinks but felt kind of funny, almost like it was *expected* we order a cocktail. If you're concerned about the cost, just don't go here. We sucked it up and ordered 2 drinks (cocktail was $18, wine was $15). 
We started with the raw tuna appetizer with caviar, granny smith apples and truffle crema. It was delicious. It comes with 4 pieces and because we split it, they put 2 each on separate plates which was a nice touch. 
Also, to note, the bread basket is insanely good. They bring a few different types and serve it with citrus olive oil, whipped mascarpone with sea salt and a tapenade. 
I had the duck and foie gras ravioli. I did enjoy them but they were a little one note. Perhaps they could have been a little heavier handed with the balsamic drizzle for a more complex flavor? I also was pretty full at that point after eating half the bread basket. I did wrap the rest to go and they tasted really great heated the next day. 
My bf had the $55 steak which he really enjoyed but didn't understand why it was worth $55.
We finished the meal with the chocolate parfait since it was the only gluten free dessert option. It was fine. Pretty light and refreshing. 
Overall we enjoyed our experience once we got over the $$ aspect. It cost $200 for 2 people. Definitely check this place out if you are gluten free since they have many GF options. Just ask your waiter for the GF menu when you're seated. They are very accommodating."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favorite places. I love everything about it! 

The ambiance is very close and cozy, perfect for date nights or business dinner!! The staff is very sweet and they are always checking on you whether it's their table or not. 

The menu is perfect, they have a little bit of everything. For starters they have this amazing yellowtail sashimi and it melts in your mouth(one of our favs). They also have this short rib ravioli/pillow and that you must must get. I have never tasted anything more delicious in my life (we get it everytime). For their entrees they have this chicken and it's so tender and the skin is perfectly crisp.

Everytime we try something new and we are never let down! This place knows what they're doing! Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"We dined on Friday April 8 rather late in the evening.  Jason was our server.  After initially looking at the menu, I was very intrigued by the variety and interesting plates.  We decided on the octopus appetizer, which they very nicely split between two plates for me and my date so that we didn't have to do it on our own.  For an entree, I had the veal chop which came with potato mash, green peas and sweetbreads.  It was cooked to perfection and a large portion (you always worry about portion size at rather expensive restaurants, or at least I do--the last thing I want to do is leave hungry).  My date had the pork chop, which came with vegetables and an apple compote, which he said was very good.  And for dessert we had a coconut panna cotta that had grilled pineapple and a papaya \"soup\".  It was light and a perfect way to end the meal.  Jason was great and he had recommendations on wine pairings and helped us pick out the delish dessert.  We had a lovely view of the Bellagio fountains as well, so that was beautiful.  All in all, this was one of the best meals I've ever had, and would certainly love to return next time we are in Las Vegas--hopefully with a Chef Conant sighting next time too!"}
{"text":"The service was very attentive, the food was out of this world and don't get me started on the desserts.  They had this amazing caramel pudding, yes pudding, that I could not stop eating!

The sommelier was pretentious but funny.  He has great recommendations once he was past the fact that, yes, we can afford what we just ordered.

I love how once the appetizers were served, they split them among everyone at the table so it was easier to share.

It really was a beautiful restaurant, romantic ambiance and fantastic food."}
{"text":"Long awaited dining experience!!
Scenic View. Impeccable service.
Arrived and seated in a timely manner.
The entire staff was overly accommodating and the atmosphere was both ambient without being too romantic of a setting for two.

Made it easy by handing over $300 and having the server pick out our entire six course meal. We are industry, so I am sure we we taken care of beyond that.

Yellowtail Sashimi
Risotto
Spighetti 
A delicious creamy truffle soup dish
Halibut
And lastly and Meat/steak dish which I was too stuffed to finish.

Topped the mean off with chocolate soufflé  and and parfait/sorbet desserts. 

Oh and I had a glass of Cabernet chosen my our server and \"if you see kay\" 

Wonderful Experience"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is pretty expensive, but it is worth every penny. 
The service was spot on. Everything you would expect where you'll spend about $100+ per person on dinner. 
Portions are small (well actually portions are normal size, they just seem small compared to most other places that try to impress you with mediocre food by giving you a lot).  
For starters we had scallops - very good, cooked perfectly.  Seared perfectly for a nice crunch, and tender on the inside. And we had the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms. Wow, the polenta was full of flavor, and the truffled mushrooms were amazing. One of the best things I have ever ate. 
We also had a pasta course (cannot remember what it was called), but it was almost like a ravioli and was stuffed with a meat puree of chicken and veal. The texture was super creamy, like a pate. This pasta was amazing.
We also had the duck and foie gras ravioli. Even more amazing than the previous pasta. Tender pasta, the sauce was perfect, and the duck and foie gras was in a perfect balance. 
For our main course we had 2 orders of veal loins wrapped in pancetta and served with sweetbreads and roasted vegetables. Let's just say there was nothing left on my plate. 
Next we had dessert.  Tiney doughnuts (zepolle) filled with nutella and served with cream anglaise. I was so full, but managed to eat every one. We also had the cheesecake. Which was very very good. 
This place will not disappoint. But you will spend some money. Our bill was 300 after tip, an we did not have any alcohol. Add a bottle of wine and it would have been about a 400 meal.  But no regrets. I'd go back as often as I could afford to."}
{"text":"Ate at Scarpetta's on a Wednesday night, week before New Year's so it wasn't packed, got seated by a really friendly hostess. Upon sitting down we were offered two types of water, nice touch. A few minutes later passed and we were greeted by the assistant manager Kelly, asked if this had been our first time and we replied yes. 

Knowing the Executive chef Dan Rossi, we were treated to having him select our food and then having his wine sommelier (Paulo) pair wines with each course. If you know very little about wines, like myself, I would highly recommend Paulo making the decisions for you, this guy is a master at his trade. Our wines complimented each course perfectly and it truly made the night one to remember. 

Trying to remember everything we ate would be a six page review so I'll just touch on a few must haves, not that we didn't thoroughly enjoy every dish, because everything was an orgasmic explosion of flavors on the tongue, but I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Polenta with a five mushroom ragu, unbelievable. Their signature spaghetti, out of this world. Ravioli's with Foie Gras and duck, I could have eaten 20. Some Carmel pudding dessert with this homemade salted Carmel toffee with crushed pretzels was insane. That was just a few of the fifteen things we got, also Fritto Misto, is a must. 

Basically your not going to go wrong with anything in this place, food is off the hook, service staff paid attention to every detail and the view of the Strip is the best. This will be on my stop every time I visit Vegas from here on out, period."}
{"text":"Wow.  Hands down the best restaurant I have been to in Vegas.  All of the food items were perfect.  I started with a salad with burrata, mixed greens, beets and hazelnuts - well designed and delicious.  For my main course I had the babay goat (I think it's called capreto) - also excellent.  My table companions had the branzino (delicious) and the out of this world, must have lobster with black macaroni.  The desert was a chocolate cake, but the star of the dish was actually the accompanying gelato, served on some sort of chocolate crubms - yum

the bread here deserves a paragraph by itself.  Between the three of us we ate four baskets.  There was a big piece that they put on top that was good.  Inside there was bread with some kind of meat in it, delicious rolls, and then some sort of bread that they had toasted so that it was crispy - it came out crunchy and airy and was perfect with the marscapone butter.

My only complaint is that the wait staff hover around you and the second you finish something they come in an snatched the plate away.  It was very noticable - do they think that this constitutes good service?  But our waiter was excellent.  They have a good wine list, and the prices are good for this quality of food

So definitely go go go!"}
{"text":"I have now been here a few times and enjoy the food overall but the first time dining at this place was a huge disappointment.  

Made a reservation for Valentine's dinner so I was super excited to try out this restaurant with my husband but the host lost our reservation and when we arrived they made us wait for over 45 minutes.  We were both starving at this point but waited patiently and when they finally sat us we got seated in the entrance area in the corner which wasn't very romantic at all.  The food also took forever which made us even more annoyed.  

I decided to try this restaurant a few times after this incident and have had a better experience so I do think they have improved.  

The ambiance in this restaurant is actually very nice and enjoyable."}
{"text":"We came here twice.  The second time service was awesome!  The waiter we had was so attentive and cool as in hip to everything.  The food was amazing and deliciously consistent with the New York location, but you're in Vegas!!!  
It's nice they have seasonal items so there is always something new to try.  I started with the autumn vegetable soup (dreamy and creamy), my husband had the tartart special.  He loved it and wouldn't share.  Then we had a pasta course, I can't stop getting the spaghetti.....i can't!  Colin got the short rib agnolotti, which was very buttery good...  Then we had the nerve to share the 24 oz ribeye,  it was soooooo good, tender and perfectly seasoned.  We actually ate it all!  plus the sides, horseradish mashed potatoes....

Mario, the manager was extremely nice and helped us out with a service problem we experienced on our last visit and made everything perfect for this visit.  We did not expect the extra desserts brought out for us to try.  You have to try the little donuts (bomboloni) and the coconut panacotta was very tropical with a guava sauce...My favorite group, Depeche Mode was playing and when they found out, they changed the playlist to only play their songs!  
There are so many choices of places to try in Vegas and this is a must.  Worth every penny and worth several more visits."}
{"text":"Deeeeelicious restaurant. Everything from the delicious bread they serve ahead of the meal down to the actual espresso. My husband and his parents are Italian and they were pretty impressed with the ingredients. 
However, to give a accurate review let me tell you in detail what made us take off one star.
To have an Italian restaurant, at least make the menu accurate. PRIMI means PASTA dishes in Italy. Not appetizers. Please adjust so it feels authentic! Secondo are the carne...meats.

Pasta was cooked perfect al dente but lacking a little salt. Servers were very attentive, but I think we had about 3 or 4 different people ask if everything was ok, including a man in a suit. That's a bit much but if they just want to make sure we are ok then I am fine with that haha.
My mother in law and myself ordered the vegetable Tagliatelle and it was perfect (minus the salt).
My father in law had the pici but was disappointed, he said there was no taste.
Husband had the duck and foie gras and was very happy, it was tasty but hard to digest. 

We ordered 3 contorni: mushrooms; they had zero taste. Creamer potatoes; best thing from all the contorni, but that's sad cause they are in the end just potatoes. And last, we had Broccolini. No taste and a little raw.

For a celebrity chef owning the restaurant, he could kick it up a notch for the contorni."}
{"text":"Honestly, I wasn't expecting great food from a swanky restaurant in Las Vegas on the strip... but I was wrong. Scarpetta offers wonderful Italian food at reasonable prices, for the quality and service.

Their bread is to die for... Seriously, I could eat a loaf of that gooey, spinach bread with butter. I also loved the rosemary foccacia.

We enjoyed the tuna appetizer, the filet, and their signature spaghetti dish and everything was perfectly executed and delicious.

The bombino (sp?) dessert was a great way to end the meal.

Honestly, we had zero complaints and just had a really wonderful dinner.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great service and well thought out menu and flavored. The pasta was perfectly made. Our favorite was an uni and crab squid ink pasta."}
{"text":"In short; the food was five stars, the service was three stars. 

I can't say enough about the food! We loved it! Unfortunately we had really bad service. We had two guys waiting on us. I don't know if the main waiter was busy or they were training, but it was obvious the second guy was more junior. He was trying to avoid saying, 'I don't know'. For example we asked what the parts were in the lamb three ways dish. We were told chops, short rib, and one other part that I can't remember right now. The chops made sense. When I commented that short rib was usually beef he agreed. So I said 'the lamb three way includes beef (which I don't eat)?'  He said yes. This sounded weird to us so we asked the first waiter and got a completely different answer. The dish included chops, shoulder, and a third type, maybe shank or something. Ultimately we decided against the lamb so I can't tell you what was really in it. 

For appetizers we got yellowtail. There was three of us and I believe the portion came with five pieces. Instead of giving us an extra piece to round it out, they gave us three pieces and kept two in the kitchen. That seemed odd so we questioned it. The junior waiter apologized and said the kitchen staff was new. Who knows!!

The yellowtail was good and an additional serving came out of the kitchen. 

We knew we had to try a pasta dish here as they are all handmade and Scott Conant does Italian food so well. We had a few dietary restrictions at the table so we ordered the tagliatelle. We were told that it came with short rib, but it could be brought on the side since I didn't eat beef. The pasta arrived and it was delicious!!!! We were told the kitchen was figuring out the short rib for us. Guess what? It never arrived! I wasn't surprised at this given how everything else was going. In fact I knew we were being duped the minute the waiter said it. The pasta was so good on its own so we didn't miss it or bring it up, but it was another problem with the service. 

For entrees two of us got the halibut and it was amazing! My husband got one of the two beef dishes. The waiters disagreed on which one was liked best by patrons, but there weren't any problems with the dishes coming out incomplete. 

For dessert we got the bomboloni. Oooh they were divine!

So again, food was top notch. There was not one thing that we did not like. I'm hoping service was only off the night we went. We weren't put off by it. We were actually laughing at everything that happened. It's a must try restaurant in my books."}
{"text":"Great Italian food here. I have to warn others that the portion is very small!!! I got the steak and my friend got a pasta ravioli. We were planning to share it but my steak was literally 5 pieces after I cut it, and her ravioli was 5 pieces. We both had 5 bites total. The food was sooo good. But why is it so small??"}
{"text":"This review is for 4.5 stars.

Some of the best pasta I have ever eaten.  You can tell it was freshly prepared and so much better than any other pasta you've ever had.  The service was strong, maybe a little too intrusive at times, but overall very good.  

We went with the polenta with mushrooms as an appetizer, spaghetti, and duck ravioli.  The bread bowl to begin was just your typical bread.  I'm not sure why there is such great reviews for it but it was pretty average, albeit perfect dipping utensils for our appetizer.  The polenta was a great started and had a cream of mushroom taste.  The spaghetti was the best spaghetti I've ever had but it's still very plain.  The ravioli was wonderful.  A little chewy inside with freshly made pasta.  And it was actually quite filling which was very surprising considering ravioli is usually a small dish with only about 5-6 large pieces.  This dish came with about 20 medium sized.  I recommend that dish to anyone.  

They have an extensive wine menu specializing in Italy but from all over the world.  This is one of your better Italian restaurants on the strip.  It has the European feel not the New York feel, so if that is the type of cuisine you're after, then give it a try.  It will run you at least $30/entree, $15-20 for appetizers, and $15 for a single drink.  My tip is to make a reservation and try to get a view of the Bellagio fountains."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service and great food.  Who could ask for more?  And we didn't even have any of Chef Scott Conant's famous pasta.  If so, this would probably be the first 6-star rating on YELP.

Not cheap but definitely worth the money.  An experience I would gladly do over and over again!"}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to try this establishment during our trip to Vegas, first weekend of April.  All I can say is from top to bottom, fantastic.  The ambiance, the service, the food all top rate.  The greeter/hostess at the door wasn't overly warm but I can get over that usually if the food and ambiance is good.  

We could only get a 6 pm seating on a Thursday (and I booked a week ahead) so I thought that was a good sign.  When we got there it was EMPTY.  We got a great seat by the window.   It started to fill up during our seating.  We got a fantastic basket of breads and spreads almost right away.  The best bread I have ever had in a restaurant bar none.  I could go either way on bread before a meal, but this was outstanding.  

My wife got the Tagliatelle which was light, yet filling enough for her to be full enough so I could play clean up at the end.  It was fantastic.  I had the duck and foie gras ravioli.  WOW.  Had a wonderful balsamic like reduction on.  They don't wow you with portion sizes, but I did not think one \"boy am I getting ripped off here.\"  Honestly the last thing I like doing is wasting food and in Vegas I don't want to be walking around with a to go box after a meal.  I'd say it was perfect portion sizes for the dollar.  

The service was superb.  Almost too good.   We were in and out in an hour which was a little disappointing because we had a great seat in the place.  But that is the business.  Turn over.  I will say we didn't linger either as it was our first night in las vegas.  

Definitely Recommended for people who want more from their pasta than the Olive Garden has to offer."}
{"text":"Scarpetta is all hype and price - not worth either.

The space is cold and vacuous. - not as scenster or happening as I would have expected.  Everyone seemed over dressed - like they were on a big night out from the burbs...not at all like the vibe on the roof top.  Reminded me of Vegas or the Time Warner Center in NYC - a fake environment plopped down in a hotel.   We had a group of 12 in the private room and they limited our choices - always annoying!  Wines were overly marked up - 10$ more than other restaurants - really expensive menu - and the quality and presentation was hardly amazing.  Price for the sake of price.

My spaghetti was very good - much better than the beef tenderloin most people ordered - if you go, get pasta...even at 30plus a bowl it is a better option!

I won't return.  Not an authentic spot and not worth the moola."}
{"text":"A new Vegas restaurant that's not ready for the big time yet. I find owners and management of restaurants that originate in NYC tend to run their restaurants the same way here in Vegas and in general the wrong way here on the west coast. Management is rude and thus rubs off on their employees. Service is slow and we found ourselves asking for everything water, drinks, desert menu etc....small portions and ridiculously high prices. Food was luke warm and unseasoned. chocolate cake for desert was good. This place has a long way to go. Stay away and eat at one of the other 100 great restaurants Vegas has to offer."}
{"text":"After years of wanting to dine at Scarpetta, my husband pleasantly surprised me for our Anniversary dinner. We had reservations (highly recommend), and were seated by the window with an enchanting Strip view overlooking the Bellagio fountains. The server promptly greeted us to take our drink order - their wine and cocktail menu had a nice selection.  Another server dropped off a bread basket filled with a warm variety (including spinach filled foccacia, sourdough, and a salami baked roll), along with marscapone infused butter, and citrus olive oil for dipping. Service was attentive and the ambience romantic. For an appetizer we tried the Frito Misto (lightly fried veggies, calamari, and shrimp). Our main entrées were Kobe flat iron (seasoned well and accompanied by creamy gnocchi) and short rib aglonotti (which was rich in consistency and flavor from the brown butter and horseradish breadcrumbs). Our evening was memorable, and the chef has done well for himself here."}
{"text":"Black Tagliolini - Best uni pasta I've ever had. Uni, crab, and tobiko mixed together. It's was the bomb pasta, seafood freshness with classic pasta"}
{"text":"I was so excited to go to Scarpetta and I was not disappointed. Our server was so personable and helpful. He recommended a bottle of wine that went perfectly with our meal. On top of that, when we mentioned how were interested in the wine industry, he went out of his way to write down a couple of documentaries for us to watch. Just above and beyond.  The heirloom tomato salad is just indescribable. The best salad I've ever had. I had one of the specials of the night--  pappardelle with burrata and prosciutto in a tomato sauce.  So great. I really wanted to try the spaghetti, but my dining partner forgot to share. It was that good.  Overall, great!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a few friends. Started with the truffled polenta and \"suschi\", then we had a ravioli and followed with the fillet. The raviolis were under cooked and we definitely should have sent them back but that was our fault.  Everything else was really nice but my biggest complaint is that the polenta, ravioli and fillet all had the same demi glace. It was too rich after the second dish and my taste buds got totally bored.  For the price I would go else where."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and was blown away by the view. You can see the Bellagio fountains from the side. Make sure to ask to sit by the window. The lighting in the restaurant was a bit dark to see exactly what you are eating but the food was great. Not mind blowing, but great.

Bread service (complimentary) - was fantastic. I loved the variety.
Scallops ($23) - were cooked perfectly but I've had better back home in SF.
Creamy polenta ($18) - was really smooth and tasty. I think it needed a pinch of salt but this was our 2nd fave of the night.
Spaghetti with tomato and basil ($24) - was not mind blowing but it's the best dish of the night and I can see why people are crazy about it.
Pici ($36) - tasted fine but the spaghetti tasted better.
Black cod ($33) - was good but not memorable.
Chocolate souffle ($15) - typical souffle but it was properly made which I appreciated. It was big, enough for the two of us.

Service was fantastic, we shared everything and our server had most of the dishes come already split. We never felt abandoned. Someone would always be around to make sure our glasses are full. Portion size is on the larger size which is great to see nowadays. We didn't know this so we over ordered by about two dishes.

We have great modern italian restaurants back home (SPQR, Quince, Flour + Water) so my standards are a bit high. I do however still recommend this place if you were craving for modern italian.

The place looks dressy but we came in jeans and were fine. There were others in jeans as well. And of course there were some who were WAY over dressed."}
{"text":"Yelped this place and saw some good reviews so I booked a reservation on my birthday during Memorial Day weekend. I loved the view, we sat right next to the window viewing the bellagio fountain. The food was OK , I ordered the pasta and I just did not like the taste of it, it had no flavor and I just tasted better. Now for the service I get it was a holiday weekend but the stuck up hostess just ruined the whole experience for me, came a little early and asked if it's possible if we can sit next to the window and she told us no it was not possible even though I made sure to book a table right next to a window on the reservation notes ? Luckily the manager was standing right behind her and told us there was a table available right now next to a window so me and my husband just agreed to be seated already. I just rolled my eyes at that rude host and walked away while the manager walked us to the table."}
{"text":"The food and the ambiance were 5 stars!  I really liked the décor here, someone put a lot of thought into the design, it's sexy and sophisticated.  To drink I had a whiskey cocktail off their menu, it was tasty.  For dinner I had a duck and foie gras ravioli which was sooo yum, the picture I took doesn't do it justice.  The service was just okay."}
{"text":"The worst part about Scarpetta is that you eventually have to leave. It was a sad moment when I took my last bite of amazingness and realized I was already having separation anxiety with my Duck and foie gras ravioli. Not to mention the mouth orgasm I had after over indulging in the Bombolini dessert with nutella dust. (Went back the following night for an encore performance ). I am not going to sit here all day and rave about how perfect the beef tartare was or how life altering the short rib angolottis were, but what i will do is tell anyone who has anything bad to say about Scarpetta, you honestly don't have a clue what good food is all about. I just read 30 reviews and one person had said \"The duck ravioli flat out sucked\" Dude STFU and have some respect. I guarantee you are the type of DB that enjoys the food at Olive garden. Get a grip. Here is my run down from a foodie who has traveled the world in search of great cuisine and spend 10 years running kitchens:

Service-
From the hostess to the table service, everything surpassed my high expectations. Very attentive without being over bearing. Luis was very sociable and you could tell he wasn't trying to up-sell anything and he gave his honest opinion when needed. Very knowledgeable about the menu and was honestly fantastic.

Ambiance-
Very comfortable, modern atmosphere complimented by great music and bellaggio fountains.

Food Quality-
FRESH PASTA! Come on how can you complain about fresh pasta  I guess if you like rubber olive garden garbage pasta and you didn't enjoy the king of pasta's execution then your review is null.

Overall Food Experience-
There is only one way to sum up Scarpetta so the common man can understand how great this experience is: 

If you like the fake bread sticks and man made olive oil at Olive garden then you aren't going to like the FRESH baked bread and stromboli complimented by lemon olive oil, eggplant capanata, or marscapone butter.

If you like frozen pasta that been frost bitten for 2 years, then your aren't going to enjoy fresh made pasta stuffed with delicate meats such as duck or short rib.

If you go to the outback and are really wowed by the meat quality then you aren't going to understand the complexity of meat that they use here. 

So for you complaining feeble minded yelpers, stay away from Scarpetta, you do not deserve to enjoy and embrace what this amazing restaurant has to offer. To the foodies who share my same enthusiasm for this amazing restaurant, you know how excited I am to go back."}
{"text":"What is with me and over-hyped restaurants for the end of 2012?  Scarpetta definitely belongs in this category based on the taste vs price category.  I mean, the restaurant looked nice, and the service was decent (if not spotty)...but the food just didn't do it.

Here's what I got to try:
Bread:  Bread was good, but not amazing like how some reviewers portrayed it.  I will give points to them having stromboli  =)  .

Fritto Misto : Nice portion size but $17 for fried seaweed (super oily) with little bits of shrimp?

Scallops: Smelled great and was very tasty.   $17 for two scallops.

Raw Yellowtail: $16 for 4 REALLY thin slices of yellowtail.  Jaws not happy.  #AVOID

Spaghetti:  At $24, I expected my mind to be blown into spaghetti heaven, maybe even meeting the dogs from Lady and the tramp.  However, I was really underwhelmed by the sauce.  There was little to no seasoning so basically all I was tasting was a bit of crushed tomatoes, cheese, with bits of basil.  Simplicity does not mean bland.  The noodles were cooked al dente and had a nice texture, so that is the lone bright spot. Ugh....BLAND BLAND BLAND.

Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli: $26.  Foie Gras in a ravioli? Must be amazing right?  Instead it was so dry that I felt like I was eating melted sand paper.  I thought duck meat was supposed to be tender and juicy?  I guess mixing duck meat and foie gras was a bad move.  The marsala reduction was delightful as I wish there was more of it to compensate for the dryness of the filling.

Roasted Chicken : Finally, a delicious dish.  It was cooked perfectly and finally seasoned correctly.  I don't mind paying a pretty penny for food...as long as its delicious!  But do keep in mind that this was still $29.  

Chocolate cake: Standard.

Doughnuts with filling:  It is what it is.  Doughnuts tossed in sugar with chocolate/vanilla filling.  I couldn't overlook that this dish was COLD when we ate it.  I understand that the filling could have caused that...but still... doughnuts should at least be warm!

Bottom line: Good environment, spotty service, and overhyped and expensive food give this place 2 stars."}
{"text":"Ugh, pretty disappointed with this place.  We should have chosen somewhere else to have our \"nice\" dinner to celebrate our friends anniversary.

Our party of 4 booked a reservation on OpenTable the night before, and 8:30pm was the only timeslot left available.  Everything went smooth upon checking in.  They serve complimentary bread which is actually a variety of different breads which was pretty cool.   Unfortunately that was just about the only good thing of the evening.

The entire night we felt rushed by the waiters and the staff. Our waiter seemed impatient while we were ordering and even when they brought the food out, they would come up from behind us and put the food on the table and then disappear. It took forever to get more bread and refills on water.  Our waiter seemed irritated when we asked for more bread.

As for the food, it was meh. The best tasting thing was our appetizer, the grilled octopus and squid ($20).  For entree, I ordered the foie gras ravioli ($28) since I'd never tried foie gras before.  If it's supposed to taste wonderful, then I obviously ordered the wrong dish.  I didn't even eat half.  The two boys at our table ordered the Short Rib Agnolotti ($26) and it was good for the first few bites, but the taste was bland after you ate a few.  They didn't finish their pasta either.

I've definitely been better to Italian places, with much better service as well. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, delicious drinks, great atmosphere, but let's be honest what's the primary reason for going to a nice restaraunt?  The food.  

We'll keep it simple, the food was meh for the price, and we are the type of people who are easily pleased. We started with the spiced artichoke soup.  It was brought out looking beautiful but it was bland:  light, but very subtle on the artichoke flavor and little to no \"spice.\"  Our entrees were the tomato basil spaghetti and the tagiatelle, a truffle pasta with veggies.  For $24 and $27 respectively we were expecting the best tomato basil pasta and truffle pasta we ever had.  Unfortunately we were not blown away.  Neither dish had anything special going on with them, other than the spaghetti being a perfect al dente.  Then we chose the chocolate cake served with an almond gelato and salted caramel.  Nothing special, seriously so dissappointed, although \"happy anniversary\" was written so beautifully on the plate it almost made up for it.  Looking back we should have gotten the bananas fosters because we heard about how great it is but unfortunately we didn't, because my wife wanted chocolate.  We were told the soufflé (bananas fosters), marscapone cheesecake, and the filled doughnuts were the top 3 deserts.

We appreciated the staff and the service and we tipped well at the end because of it, however when you spend $150 on a meal, with just 2 drinks, you just expect a bit more from the food."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant but overrated . The waiter rush us to order after giving us the menu . When we asked what was good he rushing us . He seems distracted when the restaurant wasn't busy . I ordered wine than he took the menu and didn't bother to ask the rest of the party what they wanted. So I had to ask him to take the others drink order. 
We were hoping food would be amazing after the bad service , sadly it wasn't even good . Everything was salty. My party and I drank so much water .
Maybe chef had a bad bay ."}
{"text":"I had HIGH expectations coming to this place. EXTREMELY high expectations. For all the attention to detail and harsh criticisms that Scott has on Chopped, I anticipated a true culinary masterpiece. 

My girlfriend and I weren't that hungry, because we had already had an early dinner, but decided to give this place a shot because it was the only day that would have worked with our trip to Las Vegas. We thought the best thing to do would be to just order an appetizer and only one course each, as opposed to the traditional multiple courses with a true Italian meal. We ordered the short ribs as an appetizer, I ordered the spaghetti and my girlfriend ordered the roasted chicken.

The best part of the meal was the bread. You heard me. The BEST part of the meal was the bread. I must say, I had high hopes going in, higher hopes after the bread, because that was good bread. The focaccia was tasty, with the right amount of rosemary and well developed. It tasted fresh and airy. The other breads were also very good. 

We got our appetizer, and it was very small - which is usual for a good Italian place, since it's expected that you order multiple courses. This wasn't an appetizer though, it was basically an amuse-bouche. The ribs had good flavor, and the risotto was good as well, it good texture, but I would have liked it to be cooked a little longer - it wasn't crunchy, but it was still slightly underdone. 

Out come our main courses. 

My pasta is placed on the table, and the server removes the cloche. My first impression? \"This is a main course?\" I counted how many bites it took me to finish that pasta, and it was nine. Literally nine. It was such a small meal that I was still slightly hungry afterwards - even though I wasn't all that hungry coming in. And as for the flavor? I think Barilla pasta and Prego sauce tastes about the same, as long as you add some fresh basil, which was the only saving grace. But for $24, this was ludicrous. The pasta was just about al dente as well, so there was good texture. And as for the chicken? Horrible. Absolutely horrible. And small. I asked the server about the preparation, and he noted that it is brined with anise and some other flavors, which were conspicuously missing from the flavor of the dish. I ended up spending around $80 on just these three items, and definitely was left wondering why. Scarpetta gets the award for most over-promised, under-delivered food experience I've had so far. It was so bad that any time I see Scott on Chopped or any other show, I feel like he has no idea what he is talking about. Avoid this place, and go to Secret Pizza just down the hall instead - you'll save money, eat tastier food, and leave with a better experience."}
{"text":"I find it sad that some people haven't had a great experience at this restaurant.  I found the service attentive and friendly, the space gorgeous, and the food exceptional.  Having said that, the food wasn't without flaw - the frito was salty (for me, that's a rare complaint).  The star of my evening was the spaghetti with tomato/basil - it was cooked so perfectly and the flavor was nothing less than spectacular.  I know, I know...  it is just spaghetti.  But if you are a fan of pasta, just try it.  You'll see.  Our party also had scallops, a couple wagu ribeyes, chicken, lamb - all of it was great."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. Ask for Server Julian, he is one of the best. He is on top of your needs and has great recommendations. We had an awesome time. Bar tender made some great drinks too. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"High quality food delivered very poorly.

This restaurant came recommended by a foodie friend I trust. After eating at a lot of great places on the strip, I had high expectations. My friend got the food right but our overall experience was greatly lacking.

After explaining to our server that we had no other places to be, I expected a slow, thoughtful dinner where we could savor each course. Rather it felt like the staff was trying to flip the table. Everyone in our party of four felt like the food was being served without passion. A full course meal for four was served and eaten in about an hour. I was hoping for at least a relaxing two-hour dinner. 

The food itself was quite good--not the best we've had on our trip to Vegas--but delightful. The price we paid seemed a bit on the high side for the quality of food but for the most part seemed appropriate. The foie gras ravioli is a must do.

Our server was polite but inattentive. One drink we ordered (mine) failed to make it to the table--an honest enough mistake as these oversights can happen now and then. However the server failed to notice and not once throughout the entire meal checked on drinks. I completed my meal without ever getting a beverage. When I was charged for the drink and the error was called out, the server made no effort to make it right.

The support staff was overly attentive. Empty plates were cleared promptly. However my unfinished main dish was almost taken twice before I was finished. I had to stop the food from being cleared before I was done enjoying it. Again, it seemed like they were trying to flip the table. One of the support staff also topped my unfinished sparkling water with tap.

Plate prices are on the high side and the many missteps were inconsistent with the quality I expected. There are myriad great places to eat in Vegas and service is a key differentiator. You can find better, more unique food to enliven your palate and, based on our time there, more invested humans to help you experience it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!

I arrived with a group of 8 others and we were sat at the chef's table, which is through restaurant and kitchen in a little room. The room is overlooking the whole strip with the bellagio fountain nearest. 

We started with a bunch of appetizers: tuna, oysters, octopus, bread, beef tartare. We actually ordered 3 dishes of the tuna bc it was so good. 

For the mains, people got the branzino, pasta, steak, lobster. Everything was so tasty except the steak was pretty well done when asked for medium rare. We got some side potatos, greens and mushrooms as well. 

The wine selection was perfect and service was great. I will definitely be returning back! I also love the cosmo hotel."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his 30th birthday last weekend.  Located in the Cosmopolitan, this restaurant is upscale and super trendy.  The bill was super pricey, but it was worth every penny.  We would go back in a heartbeat!

Dimly lit and super chic, this place fits right into the Cosmopolitan!  We were seated right next to a window that overlooks the Bellagio fountains.  We got to enjoy the show a few times during our dinner, absolutely beautiful.  The only eye sore is that down below are the \"hidden\" extra plants, dirt, etc that the surrounding resorts use.

A basket of five different types of bread is served with citrus olive oil, mascarpone butter, and eggplant/olive/tomato spread.  These were all absolutely amazing and they brought us another basket of bread for our meal.  This was a nice, unexpected treat!

For our primi piatti, we ordered the creamy polenta. It is usually served in a large bowl to share among the table, but they separated it for us.  The taste was so luxurious.  I could have made this my entire meal--I would highly recommend it!

For our entrees, my husband ordered their spaghetti.  This is one of their most well known dishes and it did not disappoint.  The best spaghetti I've ever tasted, hands down.  I ordered the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli and it was perfection.  The ravioli practically melted in your mouth.  I would definitely recommend both of these options!

For dessert, we ordered the Strawberry Souffle served with vanilla gelato & berries.  The best souffle I've ever had.  My husband, who isn't a sweets person, said it might be the best thing he has ever tasted.  This is a big deal coming from him.  

It was an amazing evening and this dinner was a huge part of it.  The only reason I didn't give the restaurant a 5 star review, is because I found a piece of bone in my ravioli that hurt my tooth.  When you are paying for a fancy dinner like that, you don't expect these types of things to happen.  Regardless of that slip-up, it was amazing and I'm already craving it again!"}
{"text":"Try to go in a group. I've been here twice, once with my lovely wife and once with a bunch of coworkers. This is definitely a group restaurant. Please order the spaghetti. Then, order it again, and then take an order for carry out!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to spend a semester studying abroad in Rome and Sicily, it was easily the greatest experience of my life. Ever since I have been on never ending search to find an Italian restaurant that can match the authentic flavors that Italy is famous for.... the search is over, Scarpetta is that restaurant. 

Squid ink pasta is a staple of Italian cuisine, yet it's almost impossible to find on a menu in the states. Scarpetta does it justice. The \"black fettuccine\" is cooked to perfection and topped with king crab, squid, shrimp, and lobster corral breadcrumbs... ho l'acquolina in bocca. 

Scarpetta also has the best Italian dessert I have tasted in years. The bomboloni is heavenly. They are nutella filled donuts lightly fried and served with banana gelato. They conjure up memories of sitting on the banks of the Tevere river eating bomboloni and people watching in the Italian sun. 

La vita è breve, festeggiare con gli amici, l'amore come non c'è domani."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food 
0 for the service!!!!  (and if there was anything below 0, that would be it!) 

I saw the famous Scarpetta spaghetti on Food Network's \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" and since that episode, I have been obsessed with going to Scarpetta. So excited that one opened up in Beverly Hills last October! However, I've been too busy to make the drive out there. 

I was in Vegas for 1 night on April 1st and while wandering around The Cosmpolitan Hotel, saw Scarpetta! Super excited! Made reservations for 8PM. Arrived on time and was seated promptly. Then waited, waited and waited! Really, 10 minutes before our waitress even came by our table (and empty seats all around us at this time)! Mind you, we had a 10PM show so I kept looking at the time... She took our drink order then returned 15 minutes later with our drinks!!! So almost 8:30 and have not even placed our order. She says she'll be \"right back\" and another 10 minutes.... Ahh, if it weren't for that spaghetti, we would have walked out! So 35 minutes after we arrived, she takes our order. 

Spaghetti for me and braised short ribs of beef for my husband. OMG.. our food arrived at out table at 9:30! Ate fast (because we had tickets to a show at 10). BTW, the food was amazing!!!! 

Had to ask another waiter to find our waitress so we can get the check. She came back to our table at 9:50 (without the check of course) and I explained again we had a 10PM show (which we ended up being late for) and needed to get out of there! 

So the food was as good as I thought it woud be but the service (or lack of) ruined my first Scarpetta experience :("}
{"text":"Had a birthday dinner for 9 people for 8:30 pm on a Friday night.  By the time our party arrived and we were seated it was 9:00 pm, and this was not an issue.  The server was very attentive and carefully took our orders, making helpful suggestions.  When queried about wines, the sommelier was sent our way -- and proceeded to make excellent white and red recommendations tailored to our likes.

The meal itself was well presented, and quite good.  The short rib I had for a primi was well portioned and had a delicate blend of flavors.  The spaghetti which was highlighted as the signature dish was quite good and subtle in its preparation, with the tomato and basil flavors present but not overpowering.  At our instruction, the server even had a chocolate dessert with candle brought out for the birthday girl.

Overall, it was an excellent albeit pricey meal.  Expect about $100/person for both appetizer, entree and wine."}
{"text":"Is it bad if you go to a restaurant in Vegas that you've been to elsewhere? I don't care. My sister and I went here for an incredible dinner. The service was fantastic. We were seated next to the window so we got to watch the fountains the entire night (contrary to what you might expect I did not get bored watching them over and over again). We started with the polenta w/mushrooms because I love it, the yellowtail, which was delicious and super fresh, and the scallops which were awesome. My sister had the infamous spaghetti which she loved (and I did too). My dish was out of control - it is called the black macaroni and if I could eat it all the time I would. It is squid ink pasta (not macaroni) with lobster and BASIL BREAD CRUMBS. I cannot describe how perfect this dish is - or how obsessed I now am with basil bread crumbs. Truly amazing. We got the zeppole for dessert. *Love* - truly excellent and wonderful - I wasn't expecting this level of awesome. I need to go to the one in nyc now so I can have the trifecta."}
{"text":"great spot in Cosmopolitan.  Maybe best Italian on the strip.  I had the black cod which I would get again.  Pasta was also outstanding.  Cool, dark space with  view of Bellagio fountains.  Good spot for couples."}
{"text":"Food was good. Had a party of 10 so got a really cool room with the view of the Bellagio fountain. 
Wine list wasn't very good for us as we typically order sub $100 bottles. Except for a few, most was at least $100+. That's disappointing. 

Had a good time. Service was great. Food was good. Our $110 bottle of wine recommended by the sommelier was not."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously pricey for what it is. The menu is small and simple, so every dish feels somewhat unjustified. We tried the spaghetti, which was super plain - literally just noodles, a light tomato sauce, and some basil. Granted, it was well-made, as the noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. But seriously...I don't think anyone should have to pay close to $20 for a mere plate of noodles, especially one that doesn't even have protein. We also tried a short rib dish in an attempt to get in some protein, but the portion size was laughable and the short ribs weren't even that good. I've had much better short ribs at other New American restaurants before. Had we not been staying at The Cosmo, I definitely would have gone elsewhere for my Italian fix instead, considering how expensive and just whatevers this place is. Do yourself a favor and skip it!"}
{"text":"The last time I went to dinner with the girls it was a wreck. We did not receive proper service being dolled up for dinner as we was. And the food was heavily overpriced for the quality it was.. I had the foie gras, it was pretty mediocre and bit salty. My side dish of spinach was very salty... Not sure I'll come back for another girl's dinner next time I'm in vegas."}
{"text":"I must say, I've been looking forward to visiting my favorites chefs restaurants in Las Vegas. I was thoroughly disappointed at the pasta preparation at Scarpetta. My pasta was actually crunchy, not al dente, Mr. Conant. My wife enjoyed the lamb ravioli, but agreed the pasta was undercooked. 
Talk to your chefs."}
{"text":"The service was VERY slow.  The potato chips were great.  

The food was OK but nothing memorable.

My wife had halibut which was overcooked.  I had a short rib pasta that was OK.

We DID love this eggplant dipping sauce and bread.  That was great!"}
{"text":"Restaurant Week 2011. The wife and I only planned on going out only once for Restaurant Week, but after perusing all the menus we were persuaded to try one more place -- Scarpetta at the Cosmopolitan. We were seated at a two-top by the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. One of the better views in town, it makes for a great spot for a romantic night out. The clean lines and modern motif of the restaurant interior add to the upscale and elegant atmosphere.

Scarpetta might have one of the best bread baskets around, but that can solely be attributed to the stromboli found within. Warm, chewy and delicious, it's almost a meal itself. The focaccia isn't bad either.

The first two dishes were yellowtail and polenta. The raw yellowtail consisted of four slices of fish topped with olio di zenzero, pickled red onions and microgreens. a couple slices were bland and under seasoned, while others were perfect. The other app ordered came on the recommendation of our waiter. And, I'm glad I listened to him. The creamy polenta came in a decent sized bowl along with a pot with truffled mushrooms fricassee, which the server promptly spooned into the polenta. The rich and savory dish was unlike any polenta I've had before. 

The aged sirloin beef entree came sliced, cooked medium rare as ordered and was accompanied by a few light and fluffy potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms, barolo ragu, and topped with paper thin slices of parmigiano. The sirloin was good, but not nearly as good as the other entree.

The short rib agnolotti didn't look like much when it was placed on the table -- a shallow bowl filled with a modest amount of small stuffed pasta. But, the flavor from each bite was amazing. Each piece was a thin, delicate piece of pasta stuffed with tender short rib, with an intensely rich sauce. I loved the added texture that the bread crumbs added. It was a great dish on every level.

Desserts were tasty, as well. Amadei chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce was dense and moist. The coconut panna cotta with coconut sorbetto, guava soup and pineapple was surprisingly light, creamy, and not too filling. It was a beautiful presentation with the guava soup covering and contrasting the panna cotta below.

Our service was a perfect compliment to our meal. Luis timed everything perfectly and provided the kind of personalized, friendly service that every top-notch restaurant should have.

I've had plenty of underwhelming experiences over the years for restaurant week, but this was definitely one of the best. I'm already thinking about when I'll be able to come back and hopefully enjoy more great food and service."}
{"text":"Nice place. I ordered sea scallops with truffled white asparagus pink graitfruit and uni aoili. This was an appatizer but they only gave me two scallops. My friends were raving about the bread with ham in it and if I would have known I would only get two scallops I would have tried the bread but by the time the food came there was no more bread. The servers werent the nicest and took them about an hour to serve our food. Which none should have taken that long."}
{"text":"Another place I ventured into because of YYC pizza week that I've never been to before.  500 Cucina was defending thin crust champion (a title they reclaimed in 2015).   I don't eat pork so their entry was judged by my husband who was close to swearing off all other pizzas he loved their entry so much and I ate the fiat.  Generally I like pizza but vegetarian pizzas can be so incredibly boring without some funky toppings so I didn't have high hopes for the fiat from the list of ingredient and was pleasantly surprised.  All the vegetables on that pizza had flavor.  Perhaps they were cooked, marinated or seasoned by fairies but they were all given attention before combined on my pie that's for certain.  The resulting pizza was wonderfully complex and bursting with flavor.  I'm also pleased to report left overs were just as tasty (an important rating for all pizza).   

All the food I tried was very new world Italian,  I loved it,  but it's way more flashy than the simple elegance of traditional Italian food.  While we were there it was pretty busy,  I recommend a reservation.   They had live music come on half way through our dinner which was also nice.  Our server was great,  we sat at the bar watching the pizza oven (I imagine that's a punishment for some folks but I like watching kitchens work their magic).  

I'd need more than one visit to know for certain,  but I think they may be a new favorite place for a nice dinner out among a few other favorites.  Probably my favorite new world Italian in the city though."}
{"text":"Scott Conant, you are very good my friend. Hats off to you. The spaghetti was probably the best spaghetti we've ever had, period."}
{"text":"Man, I had high hopes for this place... but can we say overrated?!  I have a theory about Vegas restaurants: they're all very hyped and expensive but tend to fall short on meeting expectations.

I was in Vegas for a convention so went in for dinner.  I ordered the duck and foie gras ravioli and it was so salty I couldn't eat more than one.  It actually felt weird on my tongue because it was so salty.   I normally don't like to send things back but there was no way I could eat the dish.  They gladly took it back and apologized.  I ordered the spaghetti in its place and they brought it out quickly so that I wasn't left waiting for my food while everyone else was eating.  Everything that the others had were alright but definitely not memorable (I don't remember what they got).  The service was great and the food was ok but those two factors along with the ridiculous prices, I would probably never go back."}
{"text":"Nailed it again!  Great food.  Amazing service.  Great ambiance.  One of my favorite restaurants in the world."}
{"text":"Solid. Never knew how \"gourmet\" pasta could get, but YES it surely can to that level. Believe it. 

Entrees:
Short Rib Agnolotti: this dish was perfection. the little ravioli-like pieces were well stuffed with flavorful short rib and the toasted breadcrumbs were the perfect topper. totally recommended.
Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli: the richness of the filling makes it a dish to remember. c'mon it's foie gras! may be too fatty/heavy for one, but a delectable dish to share. 
Spaghetti: took a bite of my friend's. pretty damn good for a traditional spaghetti dish, but it's really not like your mama's spaghetti at all. them al dente noodles were on point. 
Chicken: chicken is just chicken, to me. wasn't particularly exciting.
Prime Filet of Beef: this was another item for our table. pieces of steak were cooked med-rare, which made the pieces juicy. good, but not \"steak-house good.\"

The desserts were shared were the Grapefruit Panna Cotta and Bombolini. Both were so delicious! I'm typically hesitant about ordering fancy dessert, but these were worth it! 

In addition, we got the perfect view of the Bellagio water show from our table. And to top it all off, our server (a mid-aged Asian man) was incredible hospitable, genuine in his recommendations and considerate of our party's needs. The service really made it a great experience for our bachelorette's dinner. 

Scarpetta, thanks for making our Vegas trip a classy one."}

Whisked away to a great table for 4 overlooking Bellagio fountains.
Showered with appetizers and other taste treats.
Incredible service from various characters that epitomized and demonstrated the highest level of food service professionalism.
From the various fresh and unique breads to the delightful complimentary taste treats the meal started with a bang.
Too many dishes to mentioned but all outstanding.
Mario and team hovering over the table at critical times to ensure great service and presentation.
The meal culiminated with 4 deserts which absolutedly sealed the deal - establishing this restaurant as a staple for outstanding LV italian cuisine.
Seek out Mario - Make friends - Enjoy some great food.
Do not doubt me on this call.

{"text":"Very romantic!!! Food was very good.....love the assorted bread baskets....you could see the Bellagio water show!!!  Pasta was delicious!!!!  you must have those donut holes filled with nutella!!!! Omg that was heaven!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice elevated view of the Bellagio fountains so try to get one of the tables that take advantage of this.   

The bread basket they bring to the table was very good - many varieties.  The Buratta Salad and Branzino were also very good.    The other 3 people at the table also enjoyed their appetizers and main courses.  I had tastes of the Pasta special (Boar) and the Short Rib Agnolotti which were both very good.      The table shared a variety of desserts which were all excellent."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place between getting destroyed by craps and the gasping for smoke-free air. 

Really happy that we made time for Scarpetta on our laundry list of vegas pit stops, it was well worth it. 

Such an eye for detail and dedication to the craft of their food, I didn't see a plate saunter back to the kitchen that wasn't already licked clean. Would highly recommend the dessert section and pretty much any pasta dish.... you literally can't go wrong. 

If you're looking for authentic Italian on the strip, you better believe this is the place to go! 

My only gripes with the place:

The toilets are black... semi gloss... black.... in a candlelit dark room. Literally had no idea where the hell I was peeing. 

The servers have name tags... What is this CHILIS?! Drop the nametag you're a fine dining establishment."}
{"text":"OMG!  LOVE THIS PLACE  view of the fountains with food and drink,  best Italian food in VEGAS"}
{"text":"They don't serve tasting menu on Saturday but I still inquired. The waitress was kind enough to check with the chef and he/she agreed to it. There was a lot of food. Not only they brought out the items per the menu but also some courtesy dishes to sample. Very nice view by overlooking the Bellagio water fountain."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends for a nice sit down fancy Italian style restaurant and had a great meal. There is a good wine selection and there is a fair selection for vegetarians. The service was very good"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about Vegas is not the casinos, shows, or nightclubs (although the latter is a close second), but the abundance and quality of fine dining.  One of my girl friends requested that we dine at The Cosmopolitan on our Vegas getaway, so I picked Scarpetta because it was spendy but not quite a splurge like é by José Andrés or Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill.

As far as Italian food goes, Scarpetta was scrumptious, though overpriced like everything on the Strip.  My girl friends and I were seated at a big, chic horseshoe booth--and if it weren't for our next destination (dancing at Tryst and XS), I likely would've drank and ate more here. 

For my appetizer I had the spring pea soup ($16) with gulf shrimp, guanciale (Italian bacon), and reisling gelee.  It was the most delicious pea soup I've ever had in my life! Incredibly balanced, fresh, flavorful, and masterfully presented.  

For my main I had the duck & foie gras ravioli ($26) with marsala reduction.  I absolutely wanted to love this dish due to the presence of foie gras, but I could barely taste the foie gras, let alone the duck.  I did appreciate, however, that the pasta was homemade.  Crystal L.'s main course, the short rib agnolotti ($25), with brown butter horseradish and toasted breadcrumb was a much better choice for pasta--I was so happy when she literally gave me half!  I knew then and there that this was going to be a wonderful night!

If you like classic trattoria fare, I wouldn't go to Scarpetta.  But if you don't mind fancy, modern Italian, look no further."}
{"text":"Have to say quite disappointed for fine dining.  Service was good, just way to rush in sending out the courses.  Had a tasting menu with wine pairing.  Have to say price is not expensive, but food was not the best.  Especially signature dishes as spaghetti and duck breast.  The spaghetti is like random home made tv dinner.  Noodle was too thick.  Duck breast is way over cooked.  Expect a bit more from Cosmopolitan fine dining.  For usd 250 per person, the package should be a bit better."}
{"text":"Well, we had a nice dinner but after eating at STK the night before, Scarpetta let me down a little.
The bar is somewhat awkward, more like a long hallway with a slight \"walk of shame\" ambiance to it.  We were seated at our table - it is a beautiful room.
The bread is good but I'm not sure why some of it was cut up stromboli slices.  Hell, we are from Philly but it's very filling before dinner.
The oysters were absolutely delicious!!! The best dish we ordered without a doubt!  
Our waiter then expanded our table by lifting the sides on our square table making it a larger round table to make room for our entrees.  Unfortunately, on my side there was a huge glob of chewed gum that became visible when the waiter lifted my partition.  This was not my waiter's fault but it was still gross.  Of course, my waiter quickly worked on removing the gum but yuck! That's Vegas for you! 
My husband and I both ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.  Both dishes were warm not has hot has I like.  It was OK.  I'm kind of a pasta snob (Thanks Babbo)
Our friends felt the same about their pasta dishes, it was OK  Not mind blowing.
We ordered two bottles of Cline wine - can't go wrong there!
Dessert was good but still not out of the park.
Our bill for 4 people was about $800.  Now for 4 people in Vegas, this is the norm but this night, I don't think it was worth it.
I know a lot of people LOVE this place, maybe it was just an off night."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm easy to please (doubtful) or just as not as sophisticated as some, or maybe they have had some off nights. I've seen some not-so-great reviews of this establishment. Frankly, I don't know what it would take to please them. My new bride and I went there for our \"fancy meal\" during our honeymoon. I wanted it to be a nice and memorable experience for her as she has not eaten in as many fine dining places as I have. Scarpetta delivered. When making my reservations weeks ago I asked for a window table with a view of the fountains at Bellagio in a quiet area. We sat at what is probably the best table in the house. The wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable. Having read all of the posted reviews I knew I wanted to try the spaghetti but we didn't want it as our main dish so we went \"off script\" a bit and ordered it as an appetizer. They spit it for us perfectly. That dish alone could have ended the night on a high note. House made pasta cooked perfectly with a simple tomato and basil sauce. Heavenly. Oh, I forgot to mention the bread. The bread. Neither of us are big carb eaters but my God that bread was good! I ordered the pork chop and she ordered the fillet. Both were cooked and seasoned perfectly. We both had unforgettable desserts as well. I had the chocolate cake and she had the Bombolinis. Even the coffee was one of the best cups I ever had. 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a over the top meal at a great place. We will be back."}
{"text":"Nothing terrible and nothing good. An attractive place but with the numerous choices in Vegas I would not return. I honestly cannot remember what I ate- that tells the story"}
{"text":"Overall, I enjoyed my meal here and thought it was affordable for a nice meal on the Strip with a large group of friends. I think this is probably one of the better restaurants on the Strip. I enjoyed the ambiance and the view was relatively nice. 

My fiancé and I ordered the truffle mushroom polenta, the filet mignon, and lobster pici. Everything I ate was pretty solid. The steak was tender and cooked well and reasonably priced. The pici was a bit pricey, but it tasted pretty good and I appreciated that is was more unique than other pastas I've had. The sauce was nice and spicy and the lobster was cooked well. The pasta is homemade here which is a plus. I didn't mind paying more for it. The truffle mushroom polenta was also yummy considering the mushy texture of polenta. It was flavored well. Some of my friends ordered the Sphagetti with basil marina sauce (no meat) here and I had a try. I wasn't too impressed and wouldn't spend the 20ish dollars on it for something so plain and simple and without any meat. They raved about the sauce, but honestly I can get something similar at Trader Joes from a bag and I actually think it tastes better. Eek. 

The service was okay. The only big negative is that they forgot my pasta, which was unfortunate. 

Overall, I'd definitely come here again for the food if I want a nice decently priced fancy dinner on the strip and I wouldn't hesitate taking friends here."}
{"text":"It's a super fancy restaurant with cool decoration and some seats with nice view. The tabling service is old and kinda impatient to guests with no reservation. We ended sit in the bar, and luckily waiters at the bar are nicer. 

The food is kinda pricey but the taste is decent. I usually don't order ravioli (thought it taste like fake dumplings) but I actually almost finish the entire plate of their duck ravioli. Really tasty and sauce is quite matching. All 3 cocktails that we orders tastes not bad. 

Regardless of the price, I will recommend the food and drink, and remember to reserve the window seat then."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here the other night and it was tremendous. The atmosphere is stunning with sweeping views and the Bellagio fountains right outside the window. The waitstaff was the most pleasant of any restaurant we dined in on our trip; sociable, charming and very attentive. 
I ordered the Grilled Spanish Octopus & Squid with ceci beans, caperberries & smoked paprika vinaigrette, the Short Rib Agnolotti with brown butter, horseradish & toasted breadcrumbs and the Mascarpone Cheesecake with harry's berries, rhubarb, pistachio cream & milkshake. The meal was one of the best I've ever eaten; truly exceptional. The dessert was DIVINE. I can't say enough about this place. I am still dreaming about my meal! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Oh, that spaghetti. It's the most unassuming thing on the menu--nothing fancy, just house made noodles with tomato sauce and basil. Completely simple, and totally delicious. It's worth coming to Scarpetta just for this one dish ($24). If you're sharing it, they'll split into two perfect servings that are big enough to enjoy and small enough that you can still order other stuff. 

I'm getting ahead of myself, though. Before you get to the spaghetti, enjoy the dark, modern, understated ambience. If you're lucky enough to be seated by the window, you'll be able to catch the Bellagio fountain water shows. 

The bread basket they being is not your run-of-the-mill sort of deal. There's a serious assortment of delicious options (the rosemary focaccia is amazing!) served with mascarpone butter, eggplant caponata, and citrus-infused olive oil. 

They have a nice selection of wine, including maybe a dozen options by the glass. Didn't have much experience with their cocktails, but the old fashioned that my husband ordered was way too sweet. 

Besides the spaghetti, other menu highlights were the asparagus, which was cooked perfectly, with an egg yolk vinaigrette (hollandaise-esque, but not too heavy) and capers, and the creamy polenta with truffled mushroom fricasee--so flavorful and umami. The polenta was so loose it was a little difficult to eat without dripping all over, but the buttery mushroom goodness happening way more than made up for that shortcoming."}
{"text":"Wanted to go to a nice Italian dinner for my 21st and happened to stumble upon Scarpetta and I'm SO happy I did. Everyone in the restaurant was so attentive and helpful and our server Roberto went above and beyond. All of our dishes were amazing and the perfect portion. I recommend the spicy lobster pesto pasta! So good. Cannot wait to come back here for my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience on the strip of las vegas. I didn't expected the food to be so good. We went there for dinner in November and the first course and main plats were all outstanding!
I had the beet salad which was fantastic. Then, my entree bronzino was so flavorful as well. The service was impeccable and the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because the receptionists who were off putting making us wait needlessly even though there were plenty of seats."}
{"text":"By far one of the best filet's I have ever had. Luis the server was very knowledgeable as well and they met my gluten free dietary needs. The atmosphere is very pleasant. If your in Vegas I highly recommend giving this place try."}
{"text":"A good spot with great food. Excellent customer service. I recommend it!

First restaurant we went to upon moving to Calgary. Been back numerous times with family, friends and colleagues. Never disappointed.

Regards"}
{"text":"Scarpetta is the best kind of restaurants in my mind - elegant ambiance with a view, absolutely delicious and innovative food, coupled with perfect service! 

We had a quick meal here on our last night in Vegas before heading to the airport. We got the burrata special, which was easily the best burrata I'd ever had - it was so fresh and creamy, and the pairings were perfect! For mains, I ordered the uni black tagliatelle and my 2 girl friends ordered al cempo and foie gras ravioli. Mine was pretty good but the foie gras ravioli gave me straight up food orgasm - simply perfection!! Our server was also very nice and responsive.

I recommend dates or group dinners here, as the round tables are large but intimate. Try to get a view if you can because the restaurant sits right above the Bellagio fountain."}
{"text":"We loved it.. Small menu but very delicious. Loved the spaghetti .
We don't have reservations but we didn't have to wait too long . They sat us in the front bar area and it was good for people watching . Drinks were pricey - but good 
Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"If you are looking for best pasta on strip, this is the place! If you want the best view of Bellagio fountain from dinning table at Scarpetta, table 84 is your answer. The ambiance was quiet and intimate. It's perfect for a romantic dinner and conversation. I came here few times and never had anything I didn't like. Scarpetta serves very tasty breads. Don't fill yourself up with those yummies before your real food arrives! All pasta noodles here are hand made fresh. Lobster Pici( thick, hand-rolled pasta) is my love on pasta menu. It comes with big chunks of lobster and very tasty spiced sauce. I also really enjoy Spiced Duck Breast, Mediterranean Branzino and Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli from entree menu. One more thing you have to remember! Save some space for deserts! COCONUT PANNA COTTA is a MUST ORDER. It's very light and refreshing. It's a perfect way to end your dinner. I totally fall in love with Scarpetta as soon as I discovered this gem on strip. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do."}
{"text":"Had an amazing NYE dinner here. From start to finish it was nothing short of spectacular. Had a beautiful view of the fountains and some of the best drinks during our staycation at the Cosmopolitan. Starting with their delicious bread basket the Stromboli was fantastic. Warm cheesy meaty deliciousness. For appetizers we had the polenta and short ribs. Entrees were the Branzino and Aged Sirloin. Shared an order of their tomato basil spaghetti. The bombolini was our finisher. I would order everything again except for the Branzino, my shrimp were overcooked and it was very one dimensional. However everything else was so delicious it didn't linger very long. It was pricey but well worth the experience. I cannot wait to go back. I'm salivating just thinking about it..."}
{"text":"yelpers, your reviews hype it up again. the service was good, but the food, in my opinion is eh, okay."}
{"text":"Modern, warm and romantic restaurant featuring amazing vegan dishes by Scott Conant. My recommendations are the focaccia, roasted garden vegetable soup, rosemary braised lentils with broccoli rabe and oven dried tomatoes and tagliatelle with vegetables."}
{"text":"Lobster Picci unlike anything I've had. Pesto/pasta fresh and so tasteful. Lobster topped on pasta was more than I expected. Cauliflower soup so good. Ambience of the place is very upscale, romantic. My cousins got the spagetti which is well known even amongst the locals.  Prices obviously high, but well worth the experience."}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars for the ambience. It is very romantic. We asked for a window seat but it was too loud so we asked to be moved to one of the intimate booths. The food was mediocre. They seem to be trying too hard. Too man flavors in each dish."}
{"text":"I'm a little sad to give this update... I love Scarpetta.  I returned here for dinner after about a year and a half and there was something that just wasn't the same about it. The restaurant itself is still outstanding. And the food is great, EXCEPT, one thing just didn't seem the same anymore.  The shortrib appetizer.  All of us at the table agreed that something changed and it really wasn't good.  In fact, it's definitely now something I wouldn't order again.  The meat was dry and the flavor just wasn't there. And as for service, our waiter was nice...but there was a server who continued to hover around our table.  Attentiveness is appreciated but hovering when we're trying to enjoy our dinner was a little annoying.  And my last gripe - I ordered the chocolate souffle for dessert. Normally, the servers set it up for you and show you how to pour the chocolate over, put the toppings, etc.  But nothing.  They just placed this gigantic beautiful souffle in front of me and I stared it at like how am I supposed to eat this.  It was great, but I just thought it was weird that they didn't offer any help.   I still love Scarpetta but ... this night they were a little off."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is perfect! Views, food and impeccable service! I wish there was 6 stars."}
{"text":"A fancy italian restaurant, with hand-made pasta and a gorgeous view. 

Tips: 
- make sure you reserve a seat by the window or at least facing the window to see the Bellagio fountains 
- order the farmer's market salad, short rib & bone marrow agnolotti ravioli

Ambiance ~5 stars 
Restaurant located on the third floor of the cosmopolitan hotel and the seats and placed to face the window that has a view of the bellagio fountains. 

Food ~5 stars
Various types of bread served with olive oil, egg plant tomato spread, and ricotta cheese. I couldn't get my hands off the eggplant tomato spread. 

Farmer's market salad: definitely one my favorite salads that has pine nuts, arugula, truffle...i didn't have to force myself to eat it because it was delicious

Diver's scallop: 2 scallops that were cooked to perfection, tender

Foie gras ravioli: rich and buttery in flavor but I prefer my foie gras to be complemented with tart ingredients, I could hardly notice that it was foie gras

Short rib & bone marrow agnolotti ravioli: the menu list horseradish as an ingredient and that is something that I do not like but I couldn't taste it one bit, I preferred this dish over the foie gras ravioli since there was more flavor

Picci: pasta was interesting with chili pesto sauce and large chunks of lobster

Chocolate souffle: i was not impressed with the texture of this souffle, it was not as fluffy as I would like 

Service ~3 stars
The restaurant was understaffed on a busy new years day. We were seated but did not receive the menu until 10 minutes later. The waiter was hardly present and we had to get service from other waiters."}
{"text":"Foie Gras Ravioli- rich as hell and amazing every bite
The tar tar was also wonderful and tasted like meat heaven in my mouth
Agnolotti had perfect texture, powerful taste and left me wanting more
Fettuccini- rich and crazy good. The lamb was done perfectly and everything meshed into a perfect bite.
We had a couple bottles of wine. Both good. both recommended and not very expensive. 

service was obviously good, we pretty much had a server assistant another waiter our waiter or the manager check on our table every 2 minutes. They didn't always say anything but I consistantly noticed them doing a glance over at us."}
{"text":"We ate at Scarpetta yesterday evening go celebrate our friends' engagement. He had booked a private room overlooking the Bellagio fountains which was so nice! Our experience here was pleasant and very memorable :)

Ambiance - dark, romantic, trendy, upscale. Great for a date or fancy dinner with friends/family 

Service- excellent. Waitstaff was super attentive. I never had an empty water glass! 

Food- delicious but a little on the heavy side. Definitely come hungry! We had gotten the pre fix meal with several modifications. They had also added a few complimentary items which was nice! We started off with a bread basket which came with marscapone butter and eggplant tapenade. Some of the bread rolls had ham and cheese! I had to stop myself from stuffing myself from the bread. I don't remember everything we ate but some of the highlights were: polenta... it was so creamy and smooth! I've never had polenta like that. And we had some steak which was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The lobster Pesto noodles were also delicious and came with several lobster chunks and al dente handmade (seemed like it at least?) noodles. The bone marrow pasta and duck and foie gras ravioli were so interesting and tasty. Portions were pretty big and we left sooo stuffed. I also loved the desserts- the strawberry pana cotta had an extremely dense yet smooth texture which paired well with the strawberry gelato on top. We also loved the bombolini which were basically sugar coated donut balls. 

Value- we spend around $200 a person after tax and tip which was not bad considering all the food we got! It was good to try but I might get a la carte next time :p"}
{"text":"The foie gras ravioli and the truffle polenta nom nom nom!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Scarpetta's and it did not disappoint!  Not only is this restaurant located in the beautiful Cosmopolitan Hotel and from the restaurant you can see the water show at the Bellagio, but the staff are really friendly and the food is the best I have ever had in my entire life!  We tried a variety of dishes and even after I was full, I kept eating because the food was so good.  I'm still thinking about how delicious the food was and want to go back so I can eat here again!"}
{"text":"Came in for the spaghetti - walked away full and completely satisfied. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"I had a pleasant meal at the bar.  I got their mushroom polenta which was absolutely delicious.  The polenta was really creamy and the mushrooms flavored perfectly.  It complemented my duck foie gras ravioli really well.  The ravioli was not as good at the polenta.  I thought the skin was too thin, and the filling not substantial enough.  It was a smooth, light filling but I was left hungry after finishing it.  I probably should have gotten the other ravioli dish.

For dessert, the panna cotta with guava sauce and pineapples was a refreshing way to end the meal."}
{"text":"Salty. Just salty, but I was so hungry I ate it anyway.

$17 malbec
$18 yellowtail appetizer - 4 small pieces, good for one person
$28 duck foie gras ravioli - SALTY, but good portion size

great service made up for mediocre food.  $80 for dinner and I left slightly drunk, so that might have made up for it, too 

This is Vegas, so everything is expensive. If it wasn't, I'd give it 3 stars"}
{"text":"Came for social hour, which was a good way to try the place at a great price. Social hour is $7 for small bites and select drinks from 5:30-7:00pm on weekdays. Service was friendly and great. However, the bar does not get a view of the Bellagio fountains. 

Highly recommend the Il Limone cocktail and the Short Rib and Bone Marrow Agnolotti. We would go back there just for the agnolotti. 

The Duck and Foie ravioli, while well made, felt like a let down compared to the agnolotti. The foie, rather than adding buttery richness to the ravioli, accentuated the gamey-ness and tasted more like regular liver. 

We also got the Arancini and the Fritto Misto. The arancini was pretty standard. The fritto misto comes out as a pile of thinly sliced fried vegetables on some small bits of assorted fried seafood. There was a tiny subtle pleasant kick to the fritto misto that also added to the uniqueness of the dish."}
{"text":"Scarpetta is just one of those restaurants in Vegas that you must check out. The atmosphere is quite different than the usual Vegas type (loud and filled with buzz) restaurants. Its romantic, intimate and just has a classy atmosphere. It was relaxing to have wonderful, kind servers there to help you choose a cocktail or a good mix of entrees. 

We went to celebrate a friends birthday, and let me tell you we have never eaten better. We ordered a few appetizers, entrees and were too full for dessert. I remember the veal entree being my favorite dish of the evening. Everything was on point from the presentations to flavors. I would say that the wine list was excellent but some of their cocktails are an acquired taste. The server was gracious enough to replace one of the drinks when asked. 

I cant wait to eat here again. A favorite for sure."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here with seven other friends a few weeks ago and the atmosphere is lovely, the service was bad.  Everyone we talked to before coming here said the spaghetti was awesome! 2 friends got that and it was okay, noodles slightly too undercooked and I like it aldenti, and two people got a lobster tagalini and their stomachs were upset after,  I got the roasted chicken and when I cut into the wing part it was bloody and I discreetly let the server know and he left the breast half with me and took back only the wing, he was gone for about 15 min, nowhere to be found, when he returned I explained that I wasn't eating the breast part and he explained that is the way they cook it, with his hand in my face I had to back my chair up, that was rude and not true, my Aunt got the same dish and hers was cooked through... I would not return after this experience."}
{"text":"Celebrating in LV is unlike celebrating anywhere else.  Not only are you in the Cosmo which is beautiful to begin with, but at Scarpetta you're in heaven.  My group and I were so hungry that we headed straight for the entrees.  I had the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti.  It was so delicious.  The brown butter sauce was perfectly nutty.  The pasta cooked by a seasoned pro no doubt.  And that yumminess from the bone marrow - orgasmic.  I know it sounds brash to put it like that, but this is the experience you're likely to have!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and will come back again, willing to try the one in Beverly Hills as well. So I made reservations here this weekend knowing that my friends would enjoy the ambiance and food. Was a success, they kept thanking me for bringing them. 

This time I tried the Duck Foie Gras ravioli, it did not disappoint. I also recommend the mushroom polenta soup, very rich in flavor. The duck breast and veal chop which I had last time were amazing so I wanted to try other dishes. I shared food with some of my friends which is an excellent way to try multiple items, we don't mind, sharing is caring. The lamb my friend ordered medium was very good, although I would have ordered it medium rare it would of been better. 

As far as the service goes, they we're very attentive to filling our waters and replacing our drinks. When we paid, I gave the waiter a coupon which they emailed me for 15% off the entire meal, no problem. One of the waiters also helped me put on my jacket, very courteous. Every detail counts!"}
{"text":"Great service, so so food. Their menus are ridiculous. They try too hard. Stick to good ingredients and execution. Like many things in Vegas, their restaurant is more showy than tasty."}
{"text":"Once again Scarpetta takes the gold. Every time we come to Las Vegas and your restaurants, we are never disappointed with the price, service and quality of food. The great experience starts with Noe who always takes care of us and makes us feel like family every time we dine here. We were seated next to the windows that had a view of the Bellagio fountains. The staff is very on point and really make you feel like you are at a Michellin Star restaurant.  

The basket of fresh baked bread was a mixture of to die for breads. They are such a great start to the meal you are about to endure. We had a five course meal and every one is posted on the review. The plating of each dish was tasty to the eyes. The Tuna and Yellow tail appetizer was the smallest bites but they were the bites to remember.  Fresh, packed with the right flavors and textures.  The beet salad was very pleasant. I never like to eat beets but I could eat this beet salad every day. The earthy ness of the flavor was amazing and the dressing was so good. The creamy polenta was to die for. I could not put my spoon down to stop eating this. Every bite had a mixture of great flavors and a bite of truffle mushrooms.  The plate of green spaghetti was sooo good. It was fresh  pasta that had an amazing kick to it. It had a small kick of spicy on every bite but the creamy sauce mellowed the spiciness.  The shrimp in the spaghetti was the perfect combination of flavors. 

The braised beef was perfectly crusted and tender in the center. The two sauces that accompanied the meat was so tasty. And finally the dessert was very very very yummy. We had he Nutella stuffed doughnut balls with banana ice cream and the coconut panna Cotta was sooo good.  A must have.  The prices were soo affordable and we will always visit Scarpetta every time we go to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance and great food! The only reason I have to do 4 stars instead of 5 is really the service. Upon arriving at the time of our reservation we were told the table was getting prepared. So we decided to sit at the bar and have a drink while we waited. We ended up waiting for 15 mins and when they finally walked us back to our table the restaurant was not as packed as I had expected. Strange that it took that long to just get us seated. We started with the diver scallops YUM! And then both ended up getting pasta. We got the lamb bolognese and the Pici lobster pasta. Both were delicious! I preferred the bolognese, amazing burrata on top and plenty of meat and pasta. The lobster pasta was different but not bad at all! Our server barely checked on us and was much more interested in other tables (tables buying expensive wine, etc.) I understand giving maybe a little more attention, but at least come and check on us! I would come back because the good was that good, but maybe just sitting in the bar next time. They have nice intimate booths that would have been perfect!"}
{"text":"The food was great, but for the sparce seating, the service was lacking a bit.  It seems the rest on their reputation, rather than catering to each guest's needs.  The music was WAY too loud for dinner conversation."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner experience! Easily one of my favorite Italian restaurant in town.

Came here for dinner one night with a good friend of mine and we took advantage of the 3 course dinner offered for restaurant week. Our waiter was awesome! We got a seat not to far from the window and got a small view of the Bellagio fountains. We ordered 2 appetizers, 2 entrees to share, all were extremely tasty, but my favorite had to be the fish, crispy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside, seasoned well and definitely not overcooked. The desserts were amazing too. 

Our waiter provided the best service, super attentive, anticipated our needs, refilled our drinks constantly, catered to us which is exactly what makes or breaks a meal. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing view. Flawless service. 

Scarpetta is one of those restaurants that will sweep you off your feet. The view that you get while dining here is just breathtaking. 

I could begin by talking about how delicious their appetizers and main courses are but I would rather talk about their desserts. 

OMG. Their desserts are to die for. Their strawberry souffle is out of this world. It was light and fluffy as souffles should be but not too sweet. Melts in your mouth the second it touches your tongue. Light and slightly sweet...thinking about brings me joy. The vanilla ice cream adds to how amazing devouring this warm delicious souffle was. 

We also had the coconut panacotta with guava...silky smooth and just so so good !!
The Amaedi Chocolate Cake is what every chocolate lover craves when they think of dessert. Warm melted chocolate in every bite with ice cream on the side *-* 

Please prepare yourself and do not over eat during dinner. You do not want to skip dessert!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for date night while we were in Vegas. We really enjoyed our experience. We got a table that overlooked the fountain at Bellagio, which was beautiful. Our waiter was the nicest gentleman. We had a great time chatting up with him. We had heard wonderful things about the spaghetti so we both got that and devoured it. Their drinks were delicious and so was the complimentary bread. They catered to us very well and we were delighted. We were so stuffed so we didn't have room for dessert but I'm sure they were just as good. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant on the strip! I come here with family for every major occasion. Noe makes everything so special every time we visit. He always treats us like family. Food here is to die for. Best classic spaghetti I have ever had. Beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains. Lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"3.97 stars.

After a long day traveling to Las Vegas via Los Angeles, we were hungry and ready to celebrate our rather short weekend in Sin City.  We were able to get a booth in the designated bar area that was a bit more casual than the beautiful main dinning room.  Oh \"Little Shoe\", how pretty you are.  Ambiance:  4 stars.  

We started with a few appetizers:  The Beet Salad (2.5 stars) that my friend said was just okay and average at best; The Chestnut Soup (4 stars) was actually quiet nice and sort of like a bisque with nice chunks of pickled brussel sprouts that I usually never have, but really enjoyed; and The Braised Beef (3.5 stars) with fall root vegetables and faro risotto.

One dinner entree was the Tagliatelle pasta (3.75 stars) with fall root vegetables, truffle zabaglione and guanciale (Italian bacon).  This was the lighter of our three dishes and came in 3rd place.  The runner up dish was the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli in a marsala reduction (5 stars!)  Wonderfully rich and decadent, like buttah!!!  We thought the best dish was the Short Rib Agnolotti (5 stars!) of brown butter horseradish.  A stellar dish that had such an intriguing zing of fresh horseradish.  Giddy up little doggie, giddy up!!

Service was okay, a bit non existent initially and it took awhile to get two additional settings for our party of three; then ask for a missing bread dish.  Other than that, the waiter made his Italian wine recommendations that turned out to be not bad.  Service:  4 stars.

Tally:  
Ambiance:  4 stars  (\"New Romantic\" 80's music, a tad bit loud)
Beet Salad:  2.5 stars
Chestnut Soup:  4 stars
Braised Beef:  3.5 stars
Tagliatelle pasta:  3.75 stars
Duck & Foie Gras ravioli:  5 stars!
Short Rib Agnolotti:  5 stars!
Service:  4 stars
4+2.5+4+3.5+3.75+5+5+4= 31.75/8= 3.97 stars."}
{"text":"Damn this was such a good meal!  My friends and I dined here for Restaurant Week 2013 and all of us, but one, ordered off the Restaurant week menu.  It all began when I made reservations on Open Table, courtesy of the Yelp App on my iPhone.  I didnt have any preference of where we sat, but where the hostess sat us was remarkable!  We got a window seat facing the Bellagio, so not only did we enjoy a delicious meal, we also got to enjoy a fantastic view of the strip, the Bellagio, and also the Bellagio Fountain show all at once!  Now this was a meal to remember!  Service was top notch, there were no disappointments there; the waiter we had was very attentive and helpful in helping us make our selection from the menu.  

Course 1: Braised beef short rib - very tender pieces of sliced beef on top of what they called a risotto (not the traditional type of risotto) but it was still delicious!  The \"Risotto\" was basically diced pieces of vegetables which supported the 3-4 pieces of beef on top.  Very good combination of flavors and textures.  Very impressed.  

Before the second course came, we were all scarfing down their stromboli bread which is complimentary with our meal!  It came with other bread, which were not that memorable.  The bread was also served with three types of spreads, an eggplant marinara spread, olive oil, and something else I cannot remember. On a side note, one of my friends even asked the waiter to bring an entire basket filled with the bread, which he did!  That made her evening! haha.  

Course 2: Jidori Chicken - Now I didn't know what a Jidori chicken was, so I asked the waiter.  This whole time, I thought it was the way the chicken was cooked!  But instead, it is the type of chicken used to make the chicken, like using kurabuta pork.  I can definitely tell the difference with kurabuta pork and regular pork, but this jidori chicken was a bit more difficult to tell the difference from regular chicken, besides the fact that this chicken was MOIST throughout!  Maybe that's what makes Jidori chicken so good?  Well, next time I will know! =D  

Not only did I have the second course as my main meal, I HAD to try their handmade spaghetti everyone RAVES about!  So I ordered a dish for everyone to share!  In conclusion, it was pretty damn good.  What makes it good is the noodles!  The texture is not too over or undercooked, but just right!  I guess the handmade pasta really makes a difference in a pasta dish!  

Course 3: Chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream - Now how can you end a meal without dessert!?  My stomach was SO distended PRIOR to the second course, but I had to taste everything!  By the time dessert came, I swear I have a second stomach!  I devoured not ONLY MY dessert, but my friends dessert too!  She ordered the stuffed donuts with nutella....what?! NUTELLA in fried dough?  Yes!  Nuff said. ;-)  

I'd definitely come back to Scarpetta again!  Quite pricey for a student like myself, so probably come again with my family, during restaurant week, or when I start making the big bucks!"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful here. I came with a few friends on our Vegas vacation and was super surprise. The fettuccini with veal is my recommendation as well as their cauliflower soup."}
{"text":"The food was bad to average. The duck was gross and had a weird aftertaste. The lamb Rague was decent but it was a little bitter due to the broccoli it had in it. The yellow tail sashimi again was very average. The service was really bad. So if you want average food with bad service you should eat here... Otherwise go somewhere else. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant is very nice, but in Vegas that's pretty much true of most nice places."}
{"text":"Started with variety of bread. Had one with salami n cheese. With 3 dipping sauces- oil, cheese or carbonata. Carbonata was tangy,chock full of eggplant and delish.  Beef tartare was good. Had truffles on top.Truffles tasted bland. I thought they were supposed to be amahzing?!  Oysters, $24 for 6 minuscule oysters that weren't properly cleaned nor did it come with minonette. Could have gotten caviar with it.  But the duck foie gras ravioli was really decadent. Bit salty tho. The veal.chop was juicy and tender but tasted like.chicken. guava panna cotta was really good. The st.germain spritzone was refreshing. great service"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. The view is fantastic. Service has always been very attentive. I always go for the simple old favorite of straight up spaghetti and have never been let down. The sauce is excellent."}
{"text":"You know those few precious moments when you're absolutely falling in love with a dish? Like your eyes roll back and you carefully savor each bite, wishing the experience will never end? It's an ecstasy that only a few restaurants can deliver. This describes my dinner experience at Scarpetta, when I delicately pulled apart my fennel dusted spiced black cod. A bed of tomatoes and roasted fennel added a tangy zest to the fish. My lawd. This must be a dream. It's too good to be true!

BAM! Snap back to reality. As I used my fork and knife to draw another piece of that tender cod to my mouth, I spotted a thin black line. Hmm, that's an interesting lookin' spice. Let me tug at it some more. Lo and behold, it was a piece of hair, and it was definitely not mine. The hair was embedded in the cod's skin! I politely informed my waiter of the situation and he apologized, then asked if I would like to replace the cod with a different dish. I just wanted another cod. I wanted to return to that euphoria I was experiencing before my foodie world came crashing down on me when I discovered that unfortunate piece of keratin. 

Like Forrest Gump says, sh** happens. I understand that, but I'm at Scarpetta. This is a high-caliber restaurant, one of the best in Las Vegas, owned by the famous Chef Scott Conant. It's not something I would expect to happen here. My waiter was professional though, he quickly brought out another cod (since my partner was already done with his dish) and our dessert was on the house. I totally appreciate these gestures. Yet, when my second cod arrived, it did not taste as heavenly as the initial one. I noticed that my second dish came out a lot faster than my first, which meant it was cooked in a shorter amount of time. The meat of my second cod looked a tad raw and it was almost rubbery in texture, not as moist and soft as my first one. There goes my foodie high. Womp womp.

The kitchen staff probably invested less time and attention on my replacement dish. I know there was a slight rush to bring out my cod ASAP since my boyfriend already finished his entree. However, I was still paying for this dish and it was executed poorly compared to the first one. 

This could have easily been a four or five star review. We asked for a table next to the window and the views of The Strip and the Bellagio Fountains were stunning. So romantic and beautiful. My boyfriend and I started our dinner with the Tuna \"Susci\" with marinated vegetables and preserved truffles. This is essentially tuna wrapped around vegetables. It was almost like a sushi roll, but there was too much going on. We couldn't really tease out the tuna flavor.  

My boyfriend ordered the short rib & bone marrow agnolotti. It's cooked in brown butter, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs. He said it was good but not amazingly tasty. He was still quite hungry after finishing his pasta. 

The complimentary Amedei Chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce was decadent. The chocolate was not overly sweet and the almond gelato was creamy.

It wasn't purely the hair, but the fact that my second cod was unrecognizable compared to my first one. The rest of the items are pretty solid. The view is the best thing Scarpetta has to offer. And maybe that black cod...when it is cooked properly."}
{"text":"I was there two weeks ago with some friends and we decided to have Italian before heading out to Marquee that night. Food was okay, not really that great. Ordered a steak ($55 or so ) and it was pretty tiny. Ordered another plate of a pasta and it wasn't that good. The sauce tasted bitter to me."}
{"text":"Scarpetta is on one of Las Vega's best place for restaurants;  the third floor at  Cosmopolitan.  It is nestled next to some excellent restaurants and it more than holds its own.  I have eaten at Scarpetta many times and have never been disappointed.  

The atmosphere is semi dark and very luxurious.  We had a terrific view of the Bellagio fountains from our table.  Since their pasta is so good we ordered three pastas and one main dish.  The three pastas were the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli, the Short Rib Agnolotti  and the classic Spaghetti with tomato and basil.  Each one of these dishes are superb. Each one gets a 10 from me.  We followed the pasta by sharing a pork chop which was also excellent. 

If you are looking for an outstanding Italian restaurant look no further."}
{"text":"The service was awful: although with courteous and knowledgeable staff, we were rushed through the main course. Portion size is decent, but for American standards it might seem too little. Other than that its a great spot."}
{"text":"Awesome scenery and great service. Not to mention the food was spectacular. For a nice dinner night I would highly recommend. Be sure to get reservations"}
{"text":"So far my Favorite Italian Restaurant in Calgary, the staff are always friendly, the service was great everytime I went there. I always start with the sambuca prawns, and caprese. Both amazing appetizers, and shareable. I do have a hard time sharing the prawns. I have tried a few entrees and all have been great, the lunch sandwiches are fabulous, killer deserts and gotta end it with a cappuccino or an Expresso, the quality of the food, the authentic Italian flavors, it's definitely my Italian Fix in Calgary, Chefs Rocco and Gennaro always know how to satisfy my taste buds, I highly recommend 500 CUCINA or aka Cinquecento CUCINA to all my friends and everyone, Buon Appetito!"}
{"text":"Came here late night after the Dane Cook comedy show on June 2 2018. Awesome service, very attentive staff. 
I love the ambiance and the window views of the city. 
The candle light was nice and the food was amazing! 
We had the appetizer of short rib, a potatoes cake thing with peas that was so good. Also I got the spaghetti which was so delicious with the fat noodles and tangy marinara sauce. The bread they served to our table was also so good and fresh, soft and warm. 
I can't wait to come back to this place!"}
{"text":"It was a red-meat night. My husband and I shared a beef tartare served with a quail egg. I was worried about eating the raw meat and was glad we shared it, otherwise I don't know if I could have finished it by myself. It was delicious. We also shared the main meal, prime rib with lardo mashed potatoes and honey glazed carrots. So yum and tender! I highly recommend it. 
We shared the entire meal in order to make it to dessert only to find that the dessert there doesn't cut it. I mean it was okay, just not worth the price. I tried their Nutella & vanilla creme bombolini. It was okay. I hate saying this, cause I'm a nutella fan, but the nutella really brought the dessert down a notch. It didn't taste like a fine dining dessert. The banana bombolini tasted like banana pudding, so that wasn't good either. My husband tried the chocolate cake and he thought the presentation was lacking and the cake was only okay. Their esperesso was very strong, a good way to end the night.
FYI the drinks are delicious and pleasantly strong. I tried the berry smash and my husband had a few billionaires, both were good.
Overall: The food is super delicious, but skip the dessert."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to me by a friend, but I was disappointed with the flavours, as it just didn't compare to the likes of other neighbouring restaurants, such as Brassaii. Had the food been priced more fairly, it would have stood a chance. 

Scarpetta didn't quite live up to its name. The majority of the dishes were bland or just scarring *coughs - Spiced Mushroom Sott' Olio side dish*. The noteworthy dishes (i.e. Creamy Polenta and Black Cod) were prepared well, but not enough to redeem the whole experience. I would not recommend anyone to dine here for this price.

{"text":"Loved our dinner at Scarpetta!  We miss the Los Angeles location so were pleased to find we also love the one in Las Vegas.  The lobster pasta was so delicious and the entire staff was super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Scott Conant truly has created an amazing dining experience here in Vegas. The views of the bellagio fountains makes for a great ambience. But it's the food that makes this one of the places to eat in the city. Italian food done right can't be beat. And that's what they do here.

As others have mentioned, the duck & foie gras ravioli as well as the short rib agnolotti are to die for. 

We have been here a few times now and can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"Since I can't have access to foie gras anymore in California, it was a no brainer I would order the duck & foie gras ravioli in vegas....and an excellent choice I made.  The portions looked small but it does fill you up.  The beef tartare was also pretty amazing!  Great cozy ambiance in the beautiful cosmopolitan hotel.  I would definitely come back.....after my wedding of course."}
{"text":"Restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip are known to be overpriced, underwhelming, and catering to free-spending high rollers. As a local, I often try to avoid these tourist traps. The expensive menus often provide amuse-bouche after amuse-bouche-sized appetizers and minimally larger entrees leaving you wanting more (quantity). So, I was pleasantly surprised to find a restaurant that finally live up to the bill. I've been wanting to try Scarpetta since seeing its dineLa menu back when I lived there for a short while last year. My girlfriend surprised me with a birthday dinner here with an awesome table overlooking the Bellagio fountains. She was specifically interested in their signature tasting menu, which we later found out was not offered on the weekends. However, after speaking with the chef, our waiter was excited to let us know that it was available. 

For $110, each person gets a 7 course meal complete with an amazing bread basket and they even added an 8th course (or side dish). Three of the courses feature their signature dish including the scallops, spaghetti, and duck. Dinner starts off with a bread basket, which our waiter warned us not to devour. Having experienced fine dining before in Vegas, I completely ignored his advice and dug in. The best piece was the meat and cheese-filled stromboli. The bread spread came with marscapone butter, eggplant caponata, and citrus-infused olive oil. Since my girlfriend is gluten-free, I pretty much ate the entire bread basket myself. No regrets.

Next came the first course: a duo of  yellowtail and tuna. These two pieces of fish were just plain amazing. The pinch of sea salt really elevated the flavor of both pieces. Clean and simple. The diver scallops is a classic dish with a nicely seared scallop atop cannellini beans, and mushrooms. This came with a wonderfully fragrant side of the most creamy polenta with truffles I've ever had complement of the chef. The third and fourth courses were the freshly made spaghetti with tomato & basil with a shared plate of the short rib agnolotti. The spaghetti was simply perfect, the pasta version of a wonderful margherita pizza. My favorite dish of the night was the agnolotti. These small pasta morsels were filled with tender short rib and topped with brown butter and horseradish bread crumbs. My girlfriend compared these to chicken biskit crackers if you close your eyes. At this point, I was starting to get full. The fennel dusted black cod and spiced duck breast courses were a blur. I was getting delirious from the food coma I was about to enter. God, why did I eat that entire bread basket. I had to box the duck breast and muster all that I had left to prepare for the dessert. The amedei chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato was the perfect ending to a marathon of a meal. 

The experience was fantastic and this is by far the best value you will get on the Strip for a prix fixe meal. Both the food and service were extraordinary. A must-try restaurant for any special occasion (or if you're just looking for a fantastic treat)."}
{"text":"Superb food
Excellent service
On our last night in LV we wanted a good meal before heading to the airport
Since we have not seen the cosmopolitan hotel yet we decided to go there 
Then we checked the restaurant ratings of course on yelp
The restaurant was rated 4 stars as supposed to the lower 3 star ratings of the other restaurants
So we proceeded
We informed the maitre'd we were in a rush and we had to get out at a certain time
They went into action
Sat us...took our order...we had 2 waiting staff and 1 food runner... got our breads and drinks...took our order...made sure our drinks are always filled...food came out perfect...
The staff was so efficient that we did not feel we were being rushed... no feeling of stress at all from us or the staff...pure efficiency
We even had enough time for dessert
Btw dessert was excellent
Keep in mind that this is a very nice restaurant where you have a fancy meal and take your time to eat
We ate well and got out of the restaurant 2 minutes earlier than our deadline
Next time we are in LV, I'll definitely come back to this fine establishment and on top of that I will recommend it to everyone I know
Thank you Scarpetta and their excellent staff !
Highly-highly recommended"}
{"text":"Such an average meal...I can't see what all the raving is about......the food was just ok with the exception of the polenta. ..this was the highlight of the meal, but an app shouldn't be the best item of the night.....the bread people were raving about, eh...nothing special except for the mascarpone spread....the spaghetti was just alright. ......yes the noodles were homemade and thicker than the average spaghetti noodle, which I liked......however the sauce , what a let down....boring, bland uneventful......I was able to try pici, it didn't blow my hair back....I didn't bother with dessert because what was the point..........on a side note the tables are way to close to each other, not easy to enjoy a romantic meal when you can hear the details of 3 different conversations.....sorry not a fan"}
{"text":"Tasting menu was great.  Highlights were all the appetizers and  pasta dishes.
Duck was ok, fish was good, but skin wasn't perfectly crisp and a little too chewy.  Wine pairing was appropriate.

Overall very nice dinner, very nice setting and view.  Service was good, not perfect."}
{"text":"Scarpetta is one of the best spots to visit here in Vegas. I've been here a few times already and always had an outstanding experience. The view from the restaurant is terrific. When making reservation ask for the table at the window so you can enjoy Bellagio Fountain Show. 

Our night started with Creamy Polenta, Burrata and a complimentary basket of bread. As an entree we decided to go with Black Tagliolini and Branzino. It was so delicious that my friend said: \"if I was allergic to one of the ingredients of this dish I would commit a suicide\". Can you imagine how great the food was... Yum!

Don't forget to leave some space for dessert. Their Chocolate Cake and Coconut Panna Cotta are simply delicious.

Scarpetta is a must try. See you very soon :)."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love this place!  This is by far my favorite Italian restaurant!  The last time I went we got the chiefs choice which is pricey but it is so worth it.  You get tons of food and you can get wine with it as well and their wine selection is amazing.  It is your classic Italian restaurant so you know what you are walking into.

They  have amazing service from their waiters/waitresses to their sommelier.  Their sommelier is extremely knowledgeable and very professional.  Everyone makes you feel right at home and the food is amazing as I have already said.  

The atmosphere is very pleasing and they have a good view of the Bellagio fountains and you can definitely see a show.  I recommend this place to anyone and anytime my family comes in or one of my friends wants to take someone on a date I always recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fresh pasta that made 2 people near me say \"this is the best pasta I've ever had\". I loved the regular spaghetti and the vegetable sides. Intimate environment and great service."}
{"text":"Excellent Restaurant!!!!

I went here for my friend's birthday and it was amazing. It's located inside The Cosmopolitan hotel, and it's a bit of a walk from the lobby, but it's definitely worth the walk. I had the spaghetti, which is what it's famous for and it was incredible. My friends got a mixture of Braised Short Ribs, Pesto Pasta, and Spaghetti. Everything was FANTASTIC. The service was GREAT and I would definitely go back. The only downside is that it closes early....about 11pm. It's definitely not a late night spot. You also need to make an appointment. It was definitely the best meal I had in Vegas. Go check it out!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went her in Las Vegas during there happy hour. The food was pretty yum. The food and drying are 7 bucks each.  Regularly this place is pretty prices so happy hour was a great option for us. My fav was the pork belly but there is a different options like duck foie ravioli. If you go enjoy."}
{"text":"My 300th review and what an enjoyable experience.  This review honors the restaurant as well as my fellow yelpers who always seem to make the right call.  

The strongest recommendations were the following and the yelpers were right on:
Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli - pretty amazing
Black Farfalle - bowtie pasta with lobster was delicous - the texture of this pasta felt like someone may have actually tied it in a bow

The spaghetti was good but serves more as a filler and does not stand out next to the other dishes.

I had the sea bass (branzino) for my main dish which was also good but again, on this night, it was all about the pasta."}
{"text":"An incredibly romantic restaurant. With the Bellagio Fountain in the background, the dim lights, the candles, the wine flowing...it's the perfect setting to fall in love. The service was spot on. Attentive and helpful. The sommerlier helped me pick out a unique bottle of Italian red to compliment the meal.
We started with the oysters. (Because romance was blooming). And shared the duck and foie gras ravioli and the lamb trio. The ravioli was amazing. Rich and delicious as anything with foie gras should be. The lamb trio is the reason I knocked off a star. Although the dish overall was good, one of the lamb preparations was dry and tough. The plate of complimentary italian cookies at the end was a wonderful touch. Scarpetta will always be meaningful and I plan to be back with my love."}
{"text":"Came here just for the famous spaghetti. Delicious but definitely pricey at $24. I'd say this is probably a once in a while treat, but when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Had a really good dinner here. Probably should've gotten the pasta as everyone raved about it, but I got the black cod instead. The cod was really delicious though-cooked perfectly and had a nice flavor to it. To start we had the grilled octopus and burrata--all really good. We had the sommelier help us pick a wine and we had a red blend that was amazing."}
{"text":"Wow! The best Italian restaurant in Vegas for sure! Recommend getting at least a half pasta order to at least try the spaghetti with tomato basil dish."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Scarpetta on our recent anniversary trip.  It was amazing!  We started out with the scallops appetizer and it was great, delicious and cooked perfectly.  My husband had the spaghetti and I had the stracci.  Both dishes were delicious.  We ended the night with a gingerbread pear crisp with cinnamon ice cream.  Everything had was great.  To make the night even better, the service was the best we could ask for.  Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable.  We will definitely be back when we go to Vegas again."}
{"text":"Long awaited dinner at Scarpetta. We make a version of their tomato basil pasta at home, so I wanted to try the real deal! 

Between two people, we ordered the duck / foie gras ravioli and the tomato basil pasta. The ravioli was delectable, and I ate my fair share even though I am not a huge fan of ravioli. The tomato basil pasta was good, but a bit disappointing given I expected to be a ton better than the one we make at home - it ended up being just ok. In fact, I think I might like my version of it better. 

What I loved though was the bread basket! So many different breads and dips to try. Yum! Got me pretty pull before our main pasta dishes came out.

Also, I had made a res on open table, but came early and did \"walk in\" instead. The hostess was still nice enough to sign me in for open table (without me asking) so that I could get my points. Other places have been known to cancel the reservation. So I thought that was really nice, and left me with a great impression of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Good, real good.  Had the short rib risotto and crab, shrimp, lobster pasta.  The waiter said that the portions would be really small, European sizes, and he recommended to order a couple of things if you were hungry.

Well our group was hungry...

But after ordering the short rib risotto and seafood pasta dish, I was beyond stuffed.  I would have been completely satisfied with ordering just the seafood pasta.

Talk about overselling, but I don't think he meant to do that...who knows!

It's expensive, but Vegas in general is expensive.  If you're looking for a great meal but don't mind spending the $$$ then you should check this place out.  While their menu isn't extremely extensive I think it has a little something for everyone."}
{"text":"Tried the Scarpetta in NYC and it was an easy 5stars. The Vegas version has a great location in the Cosmo, but the food and service didn't quite knock my socks off like the genuine article. Try the fritto misto and spaghetti with tomato and basil for a great taste of Italy, but if you want to experience what Scarpetta can really deliver you have to go to NYC!! Definitely worth a shot if you're rich and hungry for Italian lol.."}
{"text":"Leave the superficial snooty attitude at the door because this Scarpetta is everything but that. You'd think you'd be dealing with staff that think they have better things to do than tend to your every whim but you get just the opposite. I was a little disappointed that we didn't get a table looking out to Bellagio's fountains but we got somewhat of a consolation prize and sat along the windowed wine cellar. 

Everyone rants and raves about their bread basket. I can tell you right now none of it is exaggerated. You get a wonderful medley of bread but the one that takes the cake is the stromboli bread. Packed with meat and cheese, you could easily fill up on them. Fight it kids. Fight the feeling! Eat one and just wait for your main entree to come out.

The roasted sea scallop was one of the largest scallops I've ever encountered. Plump, juicy and flavorful. It was served on steamed cauliflower with a splash of creamed cauliflower sauce. Both the scallop and cauliflower complimented each other perfectly. What kind of irked me was the menu described the appetizer as, \"Roasted Sea Scallops.\" When you see the word \"scallops\" you assume you get more than one. Breaking news. You only get one. It's big nonetheless but remember that you only get one.

Scott Conant's twist on the spaghetti may seem simplistic at first glance but once you taste it you can tell there is a lot more that goes on behind the scenes. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the dish fell short. The noodles were well undercooked. I like my noodles undercooked but with every bite, I could taste the rawness of the noodles in the middle. The cheese and garlic olive oil is already infused in the pasta but it was overly cheesy. I thought it took away from the tomato and basil flavor. What I did enjoy was the bit of spiciness you get. It gave the spaghetti some life. 

Overall the service was nothing short of elegance but the food, with the exception of their bread basket, was painfully average."}
{"text":"*** Review is for Restaurant Week August 2014 Menu ***

Another restaurant that I've wanted to try now marked off the list.  The Restaurant Week menu is somewhat limited in selections, but what it has was very good.

I was seated next to the window overlooking the Bellagio and the fountains which added to the good atmosphere of the restaurant.  I was brought menus and an iced tea.  I had to ask for the Restaurant Week menu and it was brought.  I had already made my choice from the online menu but sometimes things change so I wanted to make sure.

I was brought a nice bread basket with sourdough and three other breads.  Accompanying it was a trio of bread toppers/dippers--mascarpone butter, caponata, and a citrus infused olive oil.  All three were good, but I could have eaten a plate of the caponata!  The mild citrus flavor in the olive oil made that my second choice.

For the starter, I ordered the creamy polenta with fricassee of truffled mushrooms.  The polenta was brought in a white dish and the server then spooned the onion and wild mushroom mixture over the polenta.  The dish was excellent.  I almost took some bread to wipe up any leftover polenta.

For the main course, I got the fennel dusted black cod on a bed of concentrated tomatoes and roasted fennel.  The fish was cooker perfectly and was moist and soft but with a crisp crust.  The crust had a mild anise flavor from the fennel.  The tomatoes beneath, concentrated by baking until some of the water was rendered which gave the tomato a prominent flavor.  The roasted fennel was tasty.

For dessert, there was no choice but that didn't matter.  The bomboloni was a wonderful way to end a good meal.  The bomboloni consisted of two filled with Nutella ganache and one was filled with a vanilla cream.  Alongside was a small scoop of banana ice cream resting on crushed chocolate shortbread pieces.  Excellent!

Service was good for the most part.  Two small things--when your posted opening time is 6 PM, open at 6.  Seating people almost 10 minutes late is not the best form especially if someone has a show they need to get to.  Also, I had two Sweet 'n Low wrappers on the table that neither a runner nor the server cleared even though both were by several times.  That's something you wouldn't expect from a restaurant of this class.  I'm sure Chef Conant would point this out if he were dining there.  I wish I didn't have to ask for the Restaurant Week menu.  It was a sheet of paper.  Bring it with your large books of wine and dinner menus."}
{"text":"Possibly the BEST restaurant in vegas!!!  Also the pasta and dessert entrée was fantastic and we'll worth the wait!!! I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves food!!  A+++++"}
{"text":"This place offers a first class dining experience. My fave restaurant in sin city by far!

I come to this restaurant pretty much every time I go to vegas (that is pretty often) and have ordered many things off the menu. However, I keep going back to the duck and foie gras ravioli. OMG it is so freakin good! The paste of duck and fois gras in it is so smooth and silky within the ravioli pasta which is perfectly cooked al dente. Then comes the balsamic marsala sauce on top which is slightly sweet but not overpowering."}
{"text":"Went here for Vday, made a reservation. Beautiful atmosphere, romantic and delightful staff. From greeting to being served at our table, I couldn't have asked for more. The bread they give you to start off with is delicious, make sure you try the eggplant on top! Recommend getting any kind of pasta, it's their speciality (we had parm ravioli and sausage penne). Calamari here is a must for an app! Wine selection is huge, and it's nice to see how knowledgeable the servers are. Staff was polite, professional, and wouldn't let my water get half empty. New fave date night spot!"}
{"text":"OMG, this place is great!! Love Love the ambiance, very modern chic, romantic and fancy place...the service was great! We were in Vegas for the Elton John concert and wanted to have pasta for dinner so we tried this place. We have no regrets, waiters were fantastic, first course was delicious (short ribs). I had a glass of sauvignon blanc...went perfectly with my pasta! As we finished our dinner, we asked if we could take a glass of wine to go, (as we were running late to the concert) and the waiter did not hesitate and brought us our drinks! Lovely service, would definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"Nothing like fresh pasta made in house! Came here with girlfriends and had top notch service. We all chose a buddy and split our apps/entrees, and Scarpetta was nice enough to halve our plates for us! 

Definitely recommend the truffled foie gras ravioli! 

The wine list was beautiful but appallingly marked up (300%). So we brought our own vino! ($35 corkage fee)"}
{"text":"Simply AMAZING in details and taste! A must for the love of food."}
{"text":"Just wow. My new favorite place to dine in Vegas. Super swanky interior. The lights were dim and the crowd was pretty quiet when we went Friday night. Perfect after nursing a hangover all afternoon.

The basket of bread was thoroughly enjoyed by all at the table. It was accompanie breadd with marinated eggplant tapenade, evoo, and some whipped butter. Some had prosciutto and cheese marbled in them.

To start, the Kumamoto oysters were fresh and light. The cocktail sauce and mingionette were both great. We also had the grilled prawn and diver scallop with foie gras. They portioned it out for all of us so that was really nice. The vegetables in both appetizers were very well done. Everything paired nicely. We also had the uni, crab, tobiko capellini which was just ok. When you hear uni the expectation bar is set pretty high...

For my entree I had the famous spaghetti which I enjoyed. The fresh tomato and basil flavors were well balanced and the pasta wasn't too al dente which I like. My bf had the black cod. I thought it was ok, nothing special.

To end the meal, we had the bomboloni, recommended by our server. I'm glad my party didn't skip on dessert, because it was SO GOOD. The freshly fried Nutella filled donut ball was perfect paired with the light banana gelato. I'm typically not a huge fan of heavy fried desserts...but man oh man...with that gelato it was to die for.

Overall, food and service was excellent. Of course it cost a pretty penny, but what do you expect in Vegas? Definitely recommend Scarpetta if you are looking for some tasty eats."}
{"text":"Upscale Italian on the top floor of the Cosmo.  Only had an appetizer and pasta, so limited view, but think I'd go back for the full experience if I was looking for a high end (expensive) Italian option.  Pricier than the new spot over at the Cromwell, so might consider that first (see my review).

Jimmy the bartender is one of the best I have seen in the business. He knows his stuff, is personable and owns his bar; helpful and pointed in keeping it running with the staff.

Food was excellent, as was the drink."}
{"text":"a great pre-christmas dinner

started with:
tuna susci: caviar, granny smith apple and tuffle crema (just ok)
lardo wrapped prawns with chili oil and rosemary lentils (great)

moved onto:
capellini with ricci di mare (uni), dungeness crab & tobiko
pici pasta with  lobster, tarragon, almond & chili pesto 
tagliatelle with vegetables, true zabaglione & guancial 
all of which were so delicious 

capped off with:
three kinds of cheese served with seasonal compote, spiced nuts & honey comb

shared a bottle of rose 
a wonderful, wonderful night

p.s. our server was amazing.  his name is titus.  you can't beat a name like that."}
{"text":"Outstanding. The food and service were both exceptional. My girlfriend had the Kobe Flat Iron Steak and, I had the Short Rib Agnolotti (SRA). Her steak was great and my SRA was extraordinary. The SRA was crisped with brown butter and the texture/flavor was simply phenomenal. The bread at the start of the meal with the lemon infused olive oil and mascarpone butter was so good it almost ruined the deliciousness that followed.

I wholeheartedly recommend Scarpetta - for its food, service, and even decor. 

Bravo!"}
{"text":"Service & quality at an all-time high. This place was an amazing experience. Our server was Titus, he was great! Went here for our anniversary, we had their spaghetti (perfectly al dente!), some other pasta dish (beef ravioli), tuna & avocado (best appetizer), their Berry Blast drink, and their lava cake with ice cream a la mode. 

Definitely an upscale restaurant so don't be surprised if the bill goes well over $100 between 2 but like any place, definitely an experience to just try at least once.

Atmosphere is dim and fairly quiet with good background music, so it's very relaxing and calming while you enjoy your food and company. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had our 1st Valentines dinner here last night. Luis was our server and made sure we were well taken care of. Our table was right by the window and over looked the bellagio fountains. The decor was modern. The only complaint I had was the wine list didnt have any Moscato options! But highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"As others have said here, if you're a Vegas tourist who thinks that the Olive Garden is good Italian, and you just want to treat your girlfriend while in Vegas -- this probably isn't the place for you. You're going to feel the portions are small, and you may not appreciate the things that make this restaurant extraordinary.

First, price -- be prepared. WIth a first and second course, without alcohol or dessert, it's easily $40 to $50 per person. I enjoyed a glass of wine and the famous spaghetti, and my meal was $46. The wine was over priced -- Scarpetta should compare its wine pricing per glass to other similar restaurants in Vegas, and I think they would find that they are a bit too high. $15-17 per glass is a bit much.

Second quality -- The bread basket alone was incredible. I swore that I would have only one piece, but I could not resist the hot stramboli with proscuitto and cheese, and the salted butter spread was amazing. The spaghetti also was extraordinary. It is a simple dish with tomato and basil only, but the flavors combined with the thick homemade pasta made the dish memorable. It is one of the few dishes I've had where I felt that the fresh and homemade nature of the pasta really made a difference.

Finally--the view. It is one of the best in Vegas, overlooking Bellagio and the Bellagio fountains. The dark woods, the view, the candle lit room -- a wonderful place for a romantic dinner. If I'd only had a date. :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant overlooks the Belagio fountains, and there is a sophisticated and lovely ambiance. I had the pasta, because duh... it's an Italian restaurant known for pasta. It was delicious. A bit pricey, I probably won't come again because I'm not the biggest fan of Vegas in general, and I feel I can get everything I got here somewhere else for cheaper. There's nothing that really stood out as amazing and worth coming back for."}
{"text":"My friends were headed to Bacchanal for dinner and... I'm not really a buffet guy, so I walked over to Cosmo and ate here... at the bar.  I'd heard so much about that damn spaghetti dish that... I was excited to try it.  AWESOME bread basket.  It came with an eggplant thing (very descriptive, I know) that was f'ing delicious.  The spaghetti was good, but not \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\" good.  Hell... I make better spaghetti at home.  The noodles were a bit too thick for my taste (and undercooked).  Sauce was decent.

Would I go back?  Yeah, though I'd probably try something else from the menu."}
{"text":"Its killing me to give this place 3 stars. I really wanted to love this place. I watch chopped and have mad respect for Scott Conant. Every single foodie I know has recommended his very simple yet delicious spaghetti dish to me. So, we ordered it as an appetizer and BOY were we disappointed. The taste was wonderful but the pasta wasn't cooked right (Ironic I know since he dings people on this very issue). 

We told the server our pasta was a lil too al dente and he quickly corrected me that fresh pasta can't be al dente. I continued to clarify that its a big tough in the center and doesn't taste like its cooked all the way through. I completely understand that pasta should still have a touch bite to it but this was practically raw on the inside. Like I said before I REALLY wanted to love this dish and the server made me feel really stupid for not \"getting\" how pasta should be cooked. The restaurant took the spaghetti off our bill which was really nice but I wish they'd offer us a redo of the dish. 

Regardless, I haven't given up hope just yet. Every restaurant (even awesome ones) can have an OFF day. I do wish the server was a bit more understanding but what-ya gonna do right? Anyways, hope to try Scarpetta again and LOVE the spaghetti."}
{"text":"Was really impressed with the service and the food we had. Special mention to Chef Betty for the spectacular desserts. 

A must if you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"The pasta was soo good. The portions are small and food is expensive. Worth the experience to try it once. The bread they bring is you delicious. Amazing!"}
{"text":"5 stars goes to the truffled mushroom with polenta
3 stars goes to the basil spaghetti
4 stars goes to the ambience
4 stars goes to the service"}
{"text":"amazing food kind people Great environment and the owner is very cool. One of the best Italian restaurants in Calgary ."}
{"text":"My friend had tried the Scarpetta in LA and had raved about it, so when she came to town we had to try the one at the Cosmopolitan Hotel. She was absolutely right (she usually is ;) and I have been back several times since first trying it with her. 

The restaurant is beautifully done .. very contemporary and chic .. and most every seat boasts a fabulous view of the Bellagio Fountain show. It's a great place for entertaining out-of-town guests for sure. One time we even had the privilege of being seated at the \"Chefs\" Table (which is in a private room) with a prime view of the Fountain Show and the entire kitchen. 

The food .. what can I say .. everything we've tried there is spectacular! My favorites are the Short Rib Agnolotti, which is simply melt-in-your mouth goodness and the Tagliatelle with Fall vegetables, truffle zabagalione & guanciale, which is just the right amount of truffle and is nice and light. I've also tried that famous Spaghetti .. it's good, very good, but not something that I would order again. Some of my dining partners have tried the Lobster Pasta, the Black Cod and the Duck Breast and the little bites I tried were good, but not necessarily items I would order. 

From the starters, my favorites are the Creamy Polenta, again with Truffle :) and the Braised Short Ribs of Beef. The Calamari and the Scallops are also good, but we keep going back to the Polenta. 

Dessert .. the most important part of the meal .. the second time we were there, we saw something at another table that looked delicious and right up our alley .. turns out it was not on their menu but from the neighboring Scott Conant eatery DOCG Enoteca. It's called the Salted Caramel Budino with Pretzel Toffee.  It is super creamy and  the perfect balance of both sweet and salty at the same time. We shared it the first go-around but now order one each whenever we go .. and that rarely happens. 

The service is impeccable, friendly knowledgeable servers and bussers who go the extra mile and have great personalities. The first time we were there my dining partner mentioned she was heading to DC the following weekend and our server came back with a list of fun things / places for her to do while she was there."}
{"text":"Excellent -- excellent .... what a great birthday dinner experience.  The portions were perfect and the service OUTSTANDING!  had a table near the window so could enjoy the fountains at Bellagio while waiting for the meal.

All the courses were terrific and tasty.  Beef rib pasta was perfect and the dessert really great!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were seated with a view of the Bellagio fountains and it was great! Service was good. 

The 4 different types of bread were really good. I had to stop myself or I wouldn't have room to eat my main course. 

I had the duck and foie gras ravioli. The pasta was cooked perfect and the filling was rich but a little too salty for me. The wine reduction added a good balance to the pasta.

But the star is definitely the spaghetti. It had an amazing flavor with a slight bite that goes very well with the perfectly cooked pasta. 

The Amedei chocolate cake was delicious! It was a perfect balance of richness and decadence for a chocolate cake. 

My biggest disappointment was the soda drinks. I asked if they had other soda options besides fountain like Gus and Dry sodas but Scarpetta doesn't. I asked for a Ginger Ale. Without notification and with my assumption that fountain drinks are unlimited refills, I had 4 tiny glasses of mostly ice and maybe 4 oz of soda. My soda bill was $16. I had the waiter removed the extra charges.

Overall, it was a great restaurant with good food, service, and view. I'll try it again but look at other drink options."}
{"text":"Had a delicious tasting menu Sunday night - pre Valentine's.

Best seat in the house next to the window overlooking Bellagio fountains - terrific, attentive service.  

Delicious food - the executive chef, Dan Rossi worked with Alex for 14 years...therefore, good technique, now cooking Italian very nicely.

Vita Shanley's desserts are delicious.  naturally....

Masterful front of house....  plus Antonello's back in town.  

Great team of some of my most favorite professionals in a spectacularly lovely location making great food....  

Any questions?"}
{"text":"The consensus among our group about Scarpetta was pretty meh. While some of the food was well done, we expected more given the price, and several of the dishes fell flat in terms of flavor. We were able to get a last-minute reservation late on a Saturday night, but from my experience, Vegas is built to handle so many people that reservations anywhere but the most exclusive restaurants aren't necessary. 

The restaurant looks out the side of the Cosmopolitan, and you get a decent but not amazing view of the side of the Bellagio fountains (the giant Bellagio sign gets in the way somewhat). The vibe is trendy upscale, and the prices reflected that. We couldn't find any wines under $100/bottle (but if a $4400 bottle is what you want, Scarpetta can accommodate you (and yes, that's not a typo)). Consulting the sommelier revealed only 2 such options, one of which was only a red blend. The few wines I recognized were priced about 3x retail, which isn't outrageous, but it's not great either. The cocktails were strong and priced typically for Vegas at ~$16 apiece. Mine was tasty but not anything special. My wife's made her sick later that evening, despite being the only thing she drank that night (she is sensitive to cheap alcohol or alcohol with lots of sugar).

The service was average. We were promptly seated, but when it came time to order drinks our server was nowhere to be found, and he often left the table too quickly to notice that some people were trying to get his attention. This improved as the night went on, and by the end of the meal, I didn't really consider the service to be a problem.  

The appetizers are not made to share, and you should prepare to drop some cash if you want to get anything for the table. $26 for 2 scallops is hefty with a group of 6. We settled on oysters, which were the only reasonable choice we could find. Luckily, a variety of freshly-baked breads (some with meat/broccoli and cheese) are served with a nice array of spreads/dips, and all of them were tasty. The bread will keep coming if you want it, and this could easily serve as your main appetizer.

The lobster pici pasta was creamy and decently flavorful, but the portion was small for the price, which seemed to be a theme for the evening. The only exception was the Tomahawk, which was enormous and impeccably prepared. I wish I had gotten it myself, as the few bites I had were hands-down better than the NY strip I had at a steakhouse the night before. One of my friends found the short rib agnolotti quite lacking, with not much flavor to speak of. My wife had the spaghetti with meatballs, which was rather plain, to be honest. The pasta had a nice texture, but I've had better sauce out of a jar and the meatballs were underseasoned and bland. 

For dessert, we settled on the chocolate cake, which was OK but not mindblowing. It was moderately rich, but I've had richer cakes elsewhere. Additionally, the cake itself was quite small, which I found disappointing. 

Overall, I wouldn't go back to Scarpetta. It was too overpriced for the small portion sizes and unpredictable quality of the food. It would do better at a slightly lower price point or with more impressive menu items. The menu descriptions all sound great, but the execution was lackluster too often for my liking."}
{"text":"wow this place was really good. As much as i love trying restaurants that they dont already have in LA (pretty new), id heard about Scarpetta when I was visiting NY so we decided to check it out. 

I had the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli which ws delicious! a real winner! They were so flavorful that even John (notorious for his 5 minute meals)  was forced to eat slowwwly.

I also ordered the sea scallops- so juicy!  & the veal was alright, nothing to write home about.

I wish i had known to request the table with the views of the fountain! We were sitting by the wall, but that was ok.

I would definitely come back, this place is one of the better restaurants in lv at its price point."}
{"text":"Went here for an anniversary dinner. The service was great. Requested a table with a window view of the Belagio fountain. The food was amazing. The place itself was dark and pretty intimate, with top 40 music playing in the background. They had a book of available wines that was about 20 pages long, if you're into that stuff. I stayed with my old reliable Jack and coke.

Its a pretty pricey dinner. we had two entrees, two appetizers ($23 scallops which were amazing), and a few drinks by the glass. All of which rang up to about $150. 

Definitely a place I would recommend be prepared for a pricey bill however."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. We had a great view of the Strip and the food was beyond good. I think I ate more bread than I did pasta - they brought us citrus oil, mascarpone butter and bruschetta with freshly baked breads (complimentary) to start. Our meal was delicious, we started with a beet salad and scallops. For mains, my date had the short rib ravioli and I had a creamy vegetable tagliatelle. I love trying new places in Vegas but I'm super tempted to go here next time I visit since it's worth returning to."}
{"text":"The boys and I had a very good, relaxing meal here last Friday night.  Very nice restaurant in Cosmo restaurant row. Place is classy but not the least bit stuffy. Like everyone mentions, the bread selection is great. Mini Stromboli's w/ sides of marscapone, tomato/garlic...really good. Went through several of the pasta dishes for the table to begin. Duck and Foi Gras Ravioli, Risotto w/ short rib and Short Rib and bone marrow angolotti all good to excellent. Nothing better than home made pasta. Polenta w/ truffled mushrooms might have been even better that the pasta dishes...must try! I had the Veal Loin and Pork Belly. The loin was a bit dry, but flavorful..the Pork Belly was spectacular.  Friends had steak and halibut, all were very happy. Wine list is amazing..tons of Italian wines...pricey! Found a good bottle for around $100.  Overall, pretty reasonably priced meal for Vegas.  Good stuff Scott!"}
{"text":"I cheated: I sampled a few of the Scarpetta dishes at the media opening of the Cosmo. So I knew their pasta was ace. But I wanted a full plate, and I finally got to indulge when some friends from out of town wanted to chow somewhere classy but fun, cool, not outrageously expensive, etc. 

Their spaghetti w/ tomato sauce accomplishes so much out of so little. Like Rao's, it's all about the ingredients. The pasta itself has such a consistency and texture that you want to chew each mouthful until it's too fine to chew anymore. I could have downed another plate (just not at $25).

Oh: The tuna \"roll\" appetizer is delish, too."}
{"text":"The pasta was cold and we were rushed out by our server who could't give a damn about us. I guess that's just Vegas, but I was dissapointed considering how excited we were to try this place. The bread basket was killer though."}
{"text":"We had the tasting menu with wine pairing.  A++++++++++!   I highly recommend ordering this if you want to try the different flavors here.  Be come here hungry too!  Don't fill yourself with the bread basket if you're going to order the tasting menu.

Every dish was great, and this Scarpetta location is as great as the Beverly Hills location inside the Montage BH.  

I'll definitely return here again.  This outstanding meal was the highlight of my trip!

For the $7 Happy Hour at the bar area from 5 to 7pm, it's satisfactory.  The food plates are tiny so expect minuscule portions."}
{"text":"We loved our meal at Scarpetta and the view of the Bellagio fountains was a bonus. My husband had a salad and pasta dish which were superb and I had the corn soup and a lobster pasta dish. Dessert was the chocolate cake with almond gelato. Fantastic!  Wonderful meal."}
{"text":"I don't eat Italian food too much so this was definitely a different experience.

It was my brother-in-laws 30th birthday and we came with a party of 16.
The server was knowledgeable on the menu. Recommended a few good dishes. Since we were a party of 16, I understand we probably took a little longer to order as we were all deciding on what to order, but the server did not rush us at all. Everything came out in a timely manner.

They had 3 different types of bread with three different spreads, butter, some eggplant tomato-y dip, and citrus herb olive oil (definitely the best one). Just that alone was yummy. Most of us skipped an appetizer as we weren't too hungry. One guest, however, did order their yellowtail. The few bites I was able to sneak were tasty! It had a citrus flavor to it, and if you know me, then you know I drown everything in lemon.
For the entrees, I ordered their lobster pasta dish. It was very pleasant. With higher end restaurants, dishes tend to be more salty or over seasoned, which I cannot stand, but it wasn't at all. The pasta was thick and cooked perfectly. I was also able to taste the foie gras. I've never had it before and did not like that at all. The guest who ordered it, however, usually loves foie gras and didn't like it either. She said it tasted too bland. She wanted to speak to someone about it, but the waiter hardly checked on us. I also tried the short rib and bone marrow pasta dish. It was delicious. I loved the fried garlic to give it more of a crunch.

For dessert, most of us ordered their Nutella dessert, which by the way, is superb! I grew up on Nutella, and it brought me back to my childhood. It was pretty much sugar donuts filled with warm Nutella with a side of banana ice cream. Yummmmmy. Another couple at the table shared their guava dessert. It was the perfect mixture of fruits, not too sweet either!

Now for the bill splitting. We all individually calculated how much was going on each card, which was extremely time consuming and inconvenient that we had to do it ourselves, since he \"couldnt do it\".  The bill altogether wasn't too bad, and they didn't charge gratuity for that large of a party, but for this nice of a restaurant, I'd expect atleast a little happy birthday for my brother in law, but oh well. The food was worth the price. I recommend it, but I'd have to try other places before I decide on coming back."}
{"text":"A solid Italian restaurant with exceptional service. My fiancé and I sat along the window and had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains and the Strip. Our waiter was highly attentive and very friendly. Our glasses never went empty, as there was always someone rounding the tables to refill our drinks. 

My fiancé had the spaghetti and I had the pici. Both were very flavorful and the portions were just right. 

Overall a great experience. I definitely recommend this place for romantic dates!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this restaurant since it was our first time staying at the Cosmo, and it was recommended by the concierge. He even called and booked the reservation for us. We even got all dressed up for the occasion to have a romantic dinner together. 

After being seated, it took 20 minutes for the waiter to even come over. He did not greet us, introduce himself, or even offer recommendations. He just asked us what we wanted then left. 

I ordered the fish and my boyfriend ordered steak. He was pleased with the temperature of his steak, but my fish was completely raw. I had to wait another 15 minutes for my meal to be cooked while my boyfriend finished his. 

When it was all said and done, it was a $200 meal for substandard food and service. I even told the manager how displeased I was and all he said was to contact a different manager and come back and try them again. 

I work for a review site so I am willing to speak with someone on my concerns before posting a negative review online, but it was clear they get enough business and do not care how they treat guests of the hotel. Sad because with so many options in Vegas, I will be sure to let friends and colleagues who visit the Cosmo to definitely go to a different restaurant."}
{"text":"I almost filled myself up with their pepperoni and cheese bread.  Simply amazing.  Since it's complimentary, it's easy to go crazy on them without ordering an entree.  But who would be foolish enough to do that?

The service here is what you would expect of a nice fancy restaurant.  There's never a moment where my water was empty.  The waiters will give you a great recommendation for wines to pair with your meals.  Since you're already at a nice restaurant, you might as well have some wine with your meal.  If you're not an alcoholic, now is the time to start!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my 5th anniversary. They set me up with the best table in the house. Food was great. Wine recommendations were amazing"}
{"text":"I'm SO happy to write this review. My husband and I had an incredible dinner at Scarpetta to celebrate our one year anniversary, this past September. The food was perfect - we had the creamy polenta with truffle mushrooms (my favorite dish, by far. Ever. In my whole life), spaghetti (classic and wonderful - I've never had fresh pasta before, and I was in heaven!) and I think the other dish we had was a ravioli of some kind (I can't be sure, because I was in a complete state of oblivion from my polenta and spaghetti). Either way, it was ALL fabulous.

Besides the incredible food, the service was fantastic. Our server was so sweet and helpful. The view was amazing. AND, at the end of the night - because I'd told my server about how much I loved head chef/owner Scott Conant (my favorite Food Network guy/Chopped judge!) - he had Scott himself come over to our table to take a picture with us (and he was so great!).

It was the BEST night :) Thank you to Scott Conant and Scarpetta for a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"We ate here because we thought the restaurant was the same people that sold the Scarpetta vodka sauce on Amazon. Our waiter didn't think that it was their chef that sold them so we were a bit disappointed but we got the spaghetti and the sauce was very similar! Our waiter was nice and took our picture for us with the view of the Bellagio but he mistook our order and we got spinach instead of broccoli. We still got charged and did not get our broccoli which was a bit sad . However, the truffle spinach was AMAZING and the truffle mushroom polenta was our favorite. The beers were okay and the free bread assortment and spreads were a great plus! Overall, very expensive and some great dishes."}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant that provides great food and service.  We were celebrating our friend's wedding and let them know when we booked the reservation.  We assumed we would get a nice booth but the server surprised us and took us to a private dining room that had a clear view to the kitchen and over looked the Bellagio fountains.

Jennie was our waitress and she did a great job as well as the waiter helping her (I think his name was Rod or Rodolfo).  Jennie walked us through the menu and provided recommendations and was conscious of the vegetarians in our group.  Everything we ordered was great and the ambiance just added to the experience.

This restaurant is on the pricey side but a definite must for any special occasion or splurge."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Food was overpriced for the portion size, not cooked properly (pasta undercooked and lobster over seasoned), and just lacked any creativity. Service was non existent. It took 15 minutes to get a soda and 20 to get bread. 

Try something else in cosmopolitan before this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to dine here for our 5 year Anniversary, the food was very good but the service was not what I was expecting given that it is considered a fine dining restaurant. The waiter seemed to busy with his older guests and barley checked on our table. It was our first time going to the restaurant and the waiter did not explain the menu at all, he just dropped off the menus and then came back around later and asked if we were ready to order. When the dessert came I was expecting something written on it saying Happy Anniversary, but unfortunately there was nothing written on our plate. It was pretty disappointing, it was our 5 years and we were hoping to celebrate it at a nice place together. My boyfriend and I are younger than the clientele that was their, so maybe that was why the server did not pay attention to our table, but if that is the case they should really reconsider who they are hiring to work for their restaurant. The hostess and busser were very nice and friendlier than our server."}
{"text":"I am eager to go back to this restaurant and be in \"heaven\" again. Have you tried its Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli yet? It is beyond delicious! Given CA has banned Foie Gras, it makes the Las Vegas location much more appealing than the Beverly Hills one (although please comment on this post if you are certain that the Beverly Hills location still can serve the same dish!). 

The restaurant is inside Cosmopolitan hotel, so you can certainly dine your way to delish land and continue the party at Marquees club. As a cherry on top, service at the Las Vegas Scarpetta is amazing as well. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"What a great spot for yummy Italian food. Scarpetta has a very romantic feeling and the large windows give you a great view of the fountain at the Bellagio. 

Whenever possible, I order homemade pasta and last night was no exception. I had the Al Ceppo, which has house-made sausage, porcini, and lots salty olives. So good!! My husband had the veal Chop Parmigiano, and it was outstanding! The bone-in chop was tender and crispy with just the right amount of sauce and buratta.  We were too full for dessert, but the selection looked great. 

If you're looking for a romantic date spot, I would highly recommend Scarpetta."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! Here's the breakdown:
Ambiance- the decor was very modern, there were some very cool light fixtures above the bar and in the bar seating area. My only issue would be that the tables were VERY CLOSE together- it made it difficult to navigate the restaurant to get to the bathroom without getting in the way of the waiters trying to work. 
Service- A+ from start to finish. We did not see an open reservation on OpenTable so we called  and the maitre d' was so wonderful and gracious and was able to fit us in! We got a great table by the window and our waiter was just great. He took us through the menu, made great suggestions and really made us feel taken care of. 
Food- overall very good. For starters my fiance and I split the diver scallops (a small portion but we were not very hungry). The scallop was cooked perfectly, and the marcona almonds really added a delicious flavor and crunch. My only complaint would be the lack of flavor from the golden raisins that the menu said were in the dish. I was hoping for that sweet flavor but I never tasted it. For dinner we got the Pici and the Short Rib Agnolotti. These were both great! The Pici was spicy (which I enjoyed but my fiance thought was a little too much), and the Short Rib Agnolotti was phenomenal- possibly one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had! For dessert we had the coconut panna cotta which was actually quite tasty- not something I would have normally ordered but I was pleasantly surprised -a good mix of flavors and very refreshing!
Overall- I would absolutely go here again and I have already recommended this restaurant to two other friends that are planning upcoming trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Prime location, delicious food, and great service...our meal at Scarpetta was definitely one of the highlights of our Vegas trip. There were a few missteps on our food adventure, but not nearly discouraging enough to detract from the overall experience. 

We made reservations for 6:30 on Thursday night, which seemed to be the latest time to arrive and get one of the tables overlooking the Bellagio fountains. We got the last one available. The only issue with the view is that there is a giant metal bar running exactly eye level across the window, so you have to pop your head up like a little meercat just to get a glimpse of the fountains. Oh well.

We ordered the tasting menu and told the waiter that we'd like a bottle of white wine, somewhere in the semi-sweet to semi dry range, full-to-medium bodied, in the $50-60 range. The waiter brought us two options to taste, and we went with a delicious riesling. The bread course came with a lovely tray of marscapone cheese whipped butter, lemon infused olive oil, and a delicious fresh tomato spread. We didn't eat too much, because we knew we had seven courses of awesome heading our way:

1) The first course was yellowtail and tuna sushi. The yellowtail was served with thin pink rock salt wafers that complemented the fish perfectly. The tuna was rolled around marinated vegetables and served with preserved mushrooms. Everything was light, fresh, and flavorful. An excellent way to start a meal. A crispy fritto misto came on the side - the tempura fried herbs and lemon were a delicious addition to the standard tempura fare - shrimp...veggies...etc.

2) The second course was a sea scallop served on top of cauliflower, with a cauliflower puree, chili oil, and a salad with capers on top. - The capers were a bit salty for my liking, so I pulled them off, and the cauliflower with the cauliflower puree was a little redundant, but oh. my. goodness. That scallop was the best I've ever had. The crust was perfectly carmelized, and the scallop inside was tender and melted in your mouth. The small trace of heat from the chili oil added an unexpected twist to the dish and really took it to another level. 

3) The chef added in course number three - creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms. My biggest complaint here is that I can never eat anyone else's polenta again. Amazing doesn't even begin to describe it. My friend and I dove into this lake of creamy, buttery, savory goodness with reckless abandon, knowing full well that we were completely spoiling our appetite for the four remaining courses. If nobody had been watching, I would have licked the bowl. We took a little break before moving on in the meal.

4) The pasta course was both a super high and super low note in the meal. After seeing Scott Conant revered as the King of Spaghetti on television time after time, we finally got to see what all the fuss was about. The simple spaghetti dish was amazing. I have never had pasta so perfectly al dente. There was a bite to it that other pastas lack, almost to the point where you feel like it will stick in your teeth, but it doesn't. It was served with a fresh tomato basil sauce that was so perfect, it didn't need any fancy infused oils or architechtural garnishes. It was just pasta perfection. 
HOWEVER, the short ribs angnolotti with brown butter horseradish sauce was just awful. The horseradish sauce blew away every other flavor on the plate, and it wound up tasting like a big plate of mustard. This is the awkward thing about not liking a dish in a tasting course - we were only halfway through the meal and we'd had such good courses previously, that we felt a little awkward sending it back...so we just moved forward with the meal.

5) The next course was a black cod with concentrated tomato sauce and carmelized fennel. Perfect crispy skin, rich, flavorful sauce, and crunchy fresh veggies - definitely a hit.

6) Spiced duck breast with endive, cippolini onions, and a preserved orange - this dish was ingenious. The duck, endive, and onion were perfectly cooked, but it was the addition of the super thin slice of sweet preserved orange that really made the dish. 

7) Dessert - simply outstanding - a chocolate lava cake on a streak of carmel sauce with toasted almond gelato on a bed of chocolate cookie crumbs, with a delicate twirl of chocolate as a garnish. 

The only problem with this meal is that it was so delicious, there was no way you could leave anything on your plate. My friend and I polished off every dish - which left us feeling so full that we barely made it out of the restaurant.

If you decide to attempt this delicious seven course food adventure - open your wallets wide - food, drinks, and tip set us back $350...but it was well worth it."}
{"text":"Six of us and the most exciting dish was for my vegan friend who ordered the risotto. Everything else was just okay."}
{"text":"Very unique place. The food is good and they have a great wine selection with good service. If i have any complaints, it is a bit too expensive and it is noisy. The pasta is the best selection. Prepared aldente just the way I prefer my pasta. I had a lobster and pasta and it was very tasty. The sauce was over the top good. Make a reservation in advance as it is not easy to get into this place."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian spot in Vegas! If you love seafood, try the Black Tagliolini with sea urchin, Dungeness crab & flying fish roe. For dessert, my favorite is the coconut panna cotta in guava soup. It's very light and perfect tart and sweet combination.

Update: Tried their tasting menu for the first time. It didn't disappoint! It was a lot of food though, felt stuffed and couldn't finish the dessert. We had already switched it from a chocolate cake to the panna cotta. The pasta was perfectly al dente, but the portion size was slightly too big for a tasting menu."}
{"text":"Wow!  First time to a Scott Conant restaurant on 12.8.16. Walked in ready for the signature spaghetti and excited for the bread based on the reviews. Other guests wanted the tasting menu, sure!

I'm super glad we went with this. We got to try so many amazing dishes. I admit I couldn't move after dinner, and that doesn't happen often, but it was well worth it!!!  Others got the wine pairing and thought it was awesome. 

1. Start with the bread. Maybe the best bread basket I've had.  The salami and cheese bread was delicious. I could've just had that for my meal. 
2. Duo of yellowtail and tuna. Raw fish is not my favorite but I cleared the plate. This was delish. There was so much flavor. It was light and clean and tasty.  Yellowtail had pocketed red onion.  Tuna had avocado crema, pickled peppers, Granny Smith apples, and crispy quinoa. 
3. Fritto. I do wanted to try this and we got a bonus dish!  It was delicious. There was even lightly fried lemons with the veggies and seafood. 
4. The diver scallops was tender and delish with the mushrooms and blood orange. 
5. The polenta was another off menu bonus. So many people loved this, so happy I got to try it. Mixed with truffles, it was good. 
6. Spaghetti. Tomato & basil. I ate it all. It was as good as I hoped. 
7. Short rib agnolotti. A star. Very tender short rib. Very rich.  Brown butter. Horseradish. Toasted breadcrumbs. 
8. Fennel dusted black cod. I ate it all. Asparagus. Mushroom. Enough said. 
9. Spiced duck breast. I don't eat a lot of duck but this was good. 
10. We got the coconut soufflé instead of the chocolate cake. It was a late change and the soufflé was very liquid. Not sure if this is normal or not. It was good but I prefer it more cakey. Lemongrass gelato was good too. Note they did up charge for this.  $5 when on menu it's $4 more.

My fav were the duo of yellowtail and tuna, spaghetti, fritto, and the bread basket!!!

Service was good. 

Wow. There was a view of the Bellagio fountains throughout dinner. That was amazing too!

I'm full just thinking about this meal. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is at the top of my list for foods that u must try while in Las Vegas. I found this place through yelp and I called to make a reservation. From the other reviewers suggestions, I asked for a table with a view of the Bellagio Fountain light show. The food here was excellent. I wished I could have eaten here a few more times before I left Las Vegas. The service here was excellent. I was with 2 friends and I have to say all of the food here was amazing. Even the bread that they brought out was delicious."}
{"text":"I have to say, our experience at Scarpetta was one of the best fine dining experiences that I've had in Vegas yet, and I've been to a good amount of restaurants on the Strip!

I had made a reservation for Sunday night at 6:30pm through Open Table, but had cancelled it because we weren't quite sure where we wanted to eat for sure yet. I saw that there were still a few time slots for around 6pm left on Open Table, so I didn't bother to make another appointment when we decided to just go there. 

We showed up around 6:15pm and asked to be seated in the dining room. The hostess told us that all the tables are booked and that we need a reservation. I kindly told her that I had a reservation, but cancelled it because I saw that there were still many time slots left. She just looked at me and started walking us to a table. (This was kind of strange haha).

The bread that was given to start was amazing. There were 5 different kinds of bread and 3 sauces: citrus olive oil, eggplant tapenade and mascarpone cheese butter. I had to get two orders of the eggplant tapenade...so good.

Our server Roberto was extremely helpful with helping us looking over the menu and to order. 

For our appetizer we ordered the Mediterranean Octopus which was very tender. For our pasta we ordered the famous Tomato and Basil Spaghetti. It was cooked perfectly al dente. I would have to say it was the best spaghetti that I've ever had. I'm pretty much drooling thinking about it right now..

For our entrees I ordered the Fennel Dusted Black Cod and my boyfriend ordered the Filet Mignon. He had ordered medium rare, but they served it to him as medium well. I told him to tell our one of the employees (Julio) to send it back. Julio was very accommodating and made sure that my boyfriend received the second steak cooked perfectly the way he wanted. 

Roberto even included a Coconut Panna Cotta on the house for dessert because of their mistake with the steak. It was so good!!

I just wanted to give a big shout out to Roberto and Julio for making our first time experience at Scarpetta amazing, even if we had to send back my boyfriend's steak. The Tomato Basil Spaghetti was the highlight dish of the night. We will surely return to Scarpetta whenever we are in Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Loved the wine list. 
Loved the polenta. 
Loved the duck. 
Loved the service. 
Great restaurant."}
{"text":"Dinner on Saturday evening @ 6pm.

Excellent service from every person we interacted with at the restaurant.  The hostesses were quick to help us and friendly. Our server Garvin did an above average job describing dishes and being attentive without being intrusive. Even the guy filling our water and clearing our plates was amiable and professional!

Ordered the short rib ravioli which was AMAZING. Even better than I had imagined - and I day dream about pasta. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"So everyone has said a lot about the bread basket already but I am still thinking about the salami bread with the eggplant spread..it was so good & also very filling!

My friend and I split the farmer's market salad and the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti. The agnolotti was a little oily and had a wasabi aftertaste (we were later told it was horseradish) that was a little weird. The texture of it was good but didn't make up for the flavor. I liked the farmer's market salad - it was crisp and crunchy and the hazelnuts were a really nice touch. Also, I asked for warm water and was given a whole teapot of it, which was great. 

One of the girls didn't like her meal and when we told the server, he took it off our bill, no questions asked. That was really nice of him and even though one of our side dishes never got sent to the table, the amount of food we ordered turned out to be just right. 

Not too pricey, but not sure if I would come back. It was good but not great."}
{"text":"One word: delish!!! Although I feel their customer service is not up to par. Since one is paying big bucks, one should expect great service. On yelp the restaurant indicated it closes at 11pm; when I called the person on the phone (female) stated they'll close at 10:30 if it's slow.... Ahh... This is Vegas"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible. I had the tuna and avocado appetizer and it was perfect- the tuna had a ton of flavor, the avocado was fresh and had a hint of lime and salt. For the main dish I kept it simple and ordered the spaghetti (something I never order in restaurants). The pasta was cooked al dente, the sauce was PERFECT and clung perfectly to the noodles, and the basil tasted like it was just picked.

Also, the view was absolutely amazing. We got a table right next to the window and overlooked our hotel (the Bellagio), the fountains, and part of the strip. The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant was also intimate and gorgeous. My friends and I didn't have to shout to hear each other.

Overall, amazing meal."}
{"text":"Scarpetta never disappoints!  Above and beyond friendly service and amazing food.  We started with the scallops.  They were roasted with just the amount of crust.  Next was were the braised shorts ribs - tender and so much flavor!  The creamy polenta with mushrooms - OMG!  I so want to lick my plate!  I had the Duck and Foie Gras ravioli - rich and smooth and yummy!  My GF had the lobster pasta.  The pasta was perfect with a delicious spicy sauce (I know because I \"helped\" my friend out when she stepped out!)  For dessert, we shared the coconut panna cotta.  It was a sprint, our spoons flying.  Next time, we will get our own!"}
{"text":"By far, our best meal this trip to Vegas!

Views and Service were great.  We had the tasting menu, which was outstanding.  Lots of different tastes and textures - all memorable.

We also had the wine pairing with the tasting menu.  Wine pairing was good, considering the price point ($45 for the pairing), but we would have gladly paid more for a premium wine pairing option.

Outstanding evening.  Don't be in a rush - I wouldn't go here pre-theater.  Dinner took about 2 1/2 hours - we enjoyed every minute."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food, and ambience. One of the best in Vegas. An all around A+ restaurant. Highly recommend!!! Ask to get a window view--well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Dined with two others.  It is DARK.  Not romantic, just dark. Got a headache from everyone around us using their cell phones to see their menus, the food, anything!!  The bread was ok - nothing to rave about.  When my husband requested an additional slice of sourdough to have with his salad, the bread they brought was cold, like fridge cold.  For starters we had oysters, buratta salad and polenta. Hands down polenta wins, exceedingly rich so we split it three ways!   Other apps ok. Main dishes short rib agnolotti, spaghetti with meatballs and the tomato basil spaghetti. Short ribs were ok, meatballs good and the plain spaghetti meh - overwhelming tomato with not even a hint of basil. Deserts Amedei chocolate cake, Nutella & vanilla bomboloni and mascarpone cheesecake. Best course of the night - only the chocolate cake was disappointing. We had lovely wine from a B+ list and espresso to end. 

Our reservation was at 6 and it was made clear to us that we would not be seated until 6 pm. Front desk staff could use a customer service skills session. At about 7 pm, I needed to visit the restroom.  The single stall restroom was horrible. Trash cans overflowing, floor littered with water, paper, etc.  Hard to believe it could get in that condition in an hour?!? We have visited Vegas every year at least once for the last 20+ years. Lots of dinners in those years - this wasn't the worst but certainly not the best."}
{"text":"Been to both the one in Beverly Hills and Las Vegas now.

I feel that the Beverly Hills Scarpetta is better tasting that the one in Las Vegas; however, the service at Las Vegas was better than that which I received in Beverly Hills."}
{"text":"Food: Three stars
Service: Two stars
Decor and ambiance: Four stars

Went to Scarpetta with a group of 9 for the slow period between Christmas and New Year's.  The reservations were easy to come by as it was a Monday night and the place was not too busy.

The food was solid.  Started with the yellowtail appetizer that was simple and refreshing.  The secondi was the short rib agnolotti.  This was by far the best dish of the night.  Plentiful, tasty and the texture was superb.  The primi was the veal chop which was a good size portion but the quality left a little to be desired.

The service was off for a slow night.  They didn't have the scotch that the wife ordered so they default brought Macallan 12 saying that it tasted like the one we had ordered.  Also, my agnolotti came way after the others were served, they had forgotten it, but they comped the dish, so I guess that was ok.  There was just some general confusion here and there about who ordered what.

All in all, it was ok.  Over-priced for what it is."}
{"text":"Calgary's hidden gem is located in the heart of Inglewood along the main strip. The taste of Italy comes out at this cozy and genuine Italian restaurant. 

The Caprese Salad is an awesome starter.... I have never had a Caprese salad with so much fresh flavour with their amazing Buffalo Mozzarella flown in directly from Italy. 
They are known for their terrific pizzas which are raved about from everyone I talk to... Still need to try! 

We had the chefs specialty where the owner Rocoo catered a unique and off the menu dinner to celebrate our anniversary. Definitely won't forget the evening with the perfect wines to complement each course of the meal. 

Hands down the best dinner experience in Calgary with great service, top notch flavours from the chef and a personal touch from the owners. Which shows how much effort and care they put into every experience. 

Try it out. They have live entertainment on the weekends and an outdoor patio in the summer."}
{"text":"THE BEST MEAL IN LAS VEGAS. The beau is a Italian food snob and he is so picky about Italian food since he lived there for six months previously.  The bread basket is wonderful and so full of options. We could have gotten full just eating that. We had the hamachi which was so fresh and melted in your mouth.  The highlight of the meal was the DUCK AND FOIE GRAS RAVIOLI. Yes I just said that, and it was the most beautiful pasta I've had in my life. The pasta was so fresh and light, cooked perfectly. The filling was creamy and decadent. I want to go back just for that.  The service was impeccable as well."}
{"text":"The spaghetti is amazing. I almost ordered another. The veal parmigiana was so delicious. The service was amazing and so was the view looking over the bellagio fountain.

Well I could not wait to get back to have the spaghetti..so delicious!! Thank you so much again!"}
{"text":"Excellent service (Luis) 5, ambiance 5 and food 4.  They sat us exactly at the time of reservation.  They gave us an excellent table overlooking the Bellagio fountain. The waiter split our meal - very thoughtful. There were two items that we ordered that really wasn't that great 1- carpaccio looks delicious the flavors didn't blend that well. Strawberry Soufflé had great flavor but the sugar crystals was not good. 

The bread is to die for.  The pasta was amazing. Overall very good!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Italian restaurant I've been to so far! During the July 4th holiday, after trying so many restaurants, we were craving for something Italian. Being staying in Cosmo gives us easy access to this place. We're glad we did pay a visit! We had an early dinner so we were able to sit without having a reservation during a holiday long weekend. 

Their PRIME BEEF CARPACCIO* was mind-blowing! The best I've ever had! The beef was sliced so thin and it's so tender! It's cooked just right! When it's put together with the greens and cheese,, that's what you came to Vegas for! We really wanted to get a second order of this but we were too full after finishing all dishes! 

I didn't know broccoli can taste so good until I had GNOCCHETTI SARDI.... The way they did it made it such a good combination of broccoli and pasta! Best pasta ever! Very tasty, creamy but not greasy or tasting too heavy! 

Their STRAWBERRY SOUFFLE was another sweet surprise! We were a bit hesitated about getting this one as we thought it's some gelato on it. But we didn't regret after we got it! It's not too sweet but just the right amount of sweetness. The souffle is so soft and puffy. Love it! Will definitely go back again next time we in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Extreemly small portions!! Expensive. Not that good. Dont come here if you are hungry bc you will have to eat 3 bread basketts to satisfy your hunger!!"}
{"text":"WOW! What more can you want from a Las Vegas experience. Such a great experience that I actually ate here three times  Amazing service, I mean just stellar, the staff was polite and attentive. 

They accommodated a large party of 12 for us in a private room with just an hour notice. 

Onto the food: 

The mushroom polenta was divine. I had it two nights in a row. Creamy rich yet not too heavy, not overly salted, and a great mushroom to sauce to polenta ratio. Honestly one of the best I've ever side dishes I've ever had.

The pasta... Where can you go wrong here, I tried three of the pastas, squid ink pasta with roe and seaweed was amazing. The combination of the three textures the unctuous earthiness mmmm!
A simple pasta with marinara, handmade of course the sauce was buttery sweet lightly salted, and lastly my absolute favorite... 

The short rib stuffed pasta. I seriously don't have words to describe this. It had a nice crunchy crumble on top, some fancy reduction drizzled evenly over every piece. Just delicious. Bite sized, al dente, at first I thought the portion was small at first sight but wow it was so filling.

On my next visit I went with a friend:

Apps included the Yellow tail crudo with a unique and delicious infused oil I believe. 

The seafood fritto Misto which was good, but I will say it's the only thing I wouldn't get again. Fried lobster, calamari and crab I believe. It was good but too much and with everything else, I didn't want to waste any stomach space. 

The Watermelon burrata salad ... Again speechless, I mean did they grow the watermelon here? It was so fresh, juicy, crisp, the tomatoes were clearly hand picked for us lol. It was just so fresh and refreshing a great palette cleanser, and duh burrata makes everything better. 

Entree: We split a bone in ribeye. They even chopped it up nicely into two portions, more than enough to share. Medium rare cooked to perfection, I got a photo of this one, you can tell it's high quality, rested well, and extremely juicy. 

Paired with a wine, selected by the manager, it was just a great combination. They know their stuff!

No room for dessert.

On my third visit (yes all in one trip) 

I came for the black cod, tuna \"susci\" and dessert. 

I put this black cod dish up there with Nobu! It was that good. I also felt dumb not realizing it was (sushi) a fun play on words ... (Whoops) another delicious raw appetizer. 

The black cod had a caramelized onion fennel tomato topping. Cooked to perfection, flaky, buttery mmmm. I am bias as this is my favorite fish to eat. 

Onto dessert: I really really wanted the chocolate banana cake but ... I'm allergic to bananas so that was a no go but everyone around me had ordered it and it was highly recommended. 

I went with the Panna cotta, and I'm not typically a huge fan of Panna cotta due to my dislike for the texture, but man they nailed this one as well. Sweet but not toothache sweet. Smooth, dense ish. You gotta try it. Also it has a citrus pineapple caramelized fruit topping I believe. I forgot to get a photo of this one. 

Lastly the decor: 

The place is dark, classy, upscale, but they have a cool bar, and little private bar tables, great for any occasion honestly. The wine room had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains, and the main dining room was so comfortable, I didn't want to get up from the round booth. 

All in all 5 stars, I'd eat here every day if I could. Many thanks to the staff, barterders, management Etc. 

See you next time !!!"}
{"text":"I was here for a group dinner and though I am a vegetarian, the chef was able to make a very delicious lentil plate and good pasta dish. I saw the others in the group enjoy their dishes and I have been to Scarpetta in NYC so I knew this Scarpetta wont disappoint me and it surely did not."}
{"text":"Had high hopes. I ate at the bar and service was competent, but cold. I ordered a glass of Pinot noir that was delicious. I also ordered the yellowtail which was bland and overpriced, though the fish was really fresh. For my entree I had the veal ragu with fettuccine. It was ok, but something I could have made better at home. Plus, it was overpriced for what it was. The best part of the meal was the bread basket that contained a Stromboli with a side of marscapone, caponata and olive oil.

Overall, it's fine, but there are better Italian places in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Our server went out of his way and asked the chef to prepare our meal as per our request. That was really nice of the chef. Food was amazing and there is not much to say. Great food great service."}
{"text":"Good service. Thought the food was good but wasn't blown away by our meal. Had the ribeye cut. Didn't see many wine bottles below $170."}
{"text":"Love the food, the service and everything about this place. The servers and staff were great and the wine awesome...  Try to book early to get the window seats which are facing the Bellagio fountains."}
{"text":"Scarpetta is awesome.  The food, the service, the location...I loved all of it.  Yes, it is over-priced, but all Vegas restaurants are over-priced, so in my mind it's all relative.  I go into it from the beginning expecting to pay more, but I also expect the restaurant to hold up its end of the bargain and give me something that doesn't make me regret spending $100 a person.  Scarpetta definitely holds up its end of the bargain here, and now that I've addressed the price issue, I can write about the more interesting things!

We tried the short ribs for appetizer and spaghetti and branzino for entrees.  The short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth juicy good.  I've never had freshly made spaghetti before, and it was amazing...now I can confidently say that I really understand al dente!  The branzino, which I typically find simply prepared in other Italian restaurants, had a very creative and delicious preparation.  It came as two filets (with crispy skin!) on top of a hodge-podge of seafood (baby shrimp and mussels) with some kind of seafood jus that is added at the table (interesting pink color, but very nice seafood flavor).  The mascarpone butter and citrus olive oil that accompanies the bread is delicious!  

I tried a couple of cocktails, and the one that stands out the most to me was the Gallardo.  I was hesitant to try it because it included apple juice (which I don't enjoy), but the waiter assured me it didn't taste too apple-juicy and he was right!  It was flavored mostly by the basil and was so aromatic and fresh...perfect accompaniment to spaghetti!

I think the most amazing part of the meal was the strawberry souffle.  I want to go back to Vegas just to have it again.  I can't even describe it.  Just get it and try different bites with the ice cream, rhubarb and the other sweet sauce it comes with...pure eating pleasure sensations.  We also had the bomboloni, which were very good, but at the end of the day just still  felt like donuts and weren't as special as some of the other items I tried.

As mentioned by many other reviewers here, the view over the Bellagio fountain is pretty sweet, and it is just so lovely right around sunset.  The interior ambiance of the restaurant is classy and fun.

On a side note, I am totally addicted to the show Chopped and love Scott Conant and was so happy his restaurant did not disappoint :)"}
{"text":"Picture a classy Italian restaurant with the Bellagio Fountain water show in the background and you've got one heck of an intimate dinner experience. 

I searched high and low for the top restaurants on the Strip and Scarpetta came to mind because of it's location and well known cuisine. With the dimly lit atmosphere and fine modern decor, I had a good hunch this would be the perfect place to share a late night dinner. 

We came without a reservation but was immediately seated in the main dining area. The server immediately placed our menus and brought out our waters. He returned with a bread basket filled with a variety of freshly baked breads and a side of olive oil, eggplant tapenade, and cheese. Each bite was intoxicating and we had to forcibly stop to avoid getting too full. 

I dared to be adventurous and ordered a Billionaire $16 (homage to homie Bobby Axelrod from \"Billions\") and thoroughly enjoyed this bourbon based cocktail with a touch of pomegranate and absinthe. This is worth coming back to at least sip at the bar to pregame or as a nightcap. My guest ordered an Eagle Rare 10 Year ($18) in addition to our meal. 

We love to share our dishes and decided to exclusively order two seafood plates:

- Mediterranean Octopus ($21) olive oil poached potato, tonatto sauce & salsa verde
- Fennel Dusted Black Cod ($35) asparagus, hedgehog mushroom 

The grilled single tentacle of the octopus was cooked perfectly without the excess chew or toughness. The lightly seasoned potatoes matched well with the texture of the octopus. This is a must order for any seafood fans. We scrambled to see who would get the last bite and I bet you can imagine who got it. 

The server was kind enough to split our black cod order for each of us to enjoy. The acidity of the tomatoes worked nicely to cut the velvety richness of the cod. With a mix of the mushrooms and sauce, the dish became ordinary to extraordinary. 

Dessert was left to another venue but would like another opportunity to make room on a future visit. 

Our server took care of us from start to finish. At the end, we felt slightly rushed because we were one of the last diners but overall, felt acknowledged throughout our meal. 

If you're looking for an upscale meal with finesse, attentive service and a gorgeous view, consider making an OpenTable reservation here. Every bite and moment from the dinner was memorable. For now, my restaurant experience at The Cosmopolitan (STK, Rose Rabbit Lie and now Scarpetta) have been very positive and I can not wait to try the rest of their eateries."}
{"text":"We were starving when our flight landed in Vegas. Luckily, they were flexible on our arrival time with the reservation, but I guess it wasn't totally full anyway even though it was a Friday night. 

The warm  bread basket was a nice way to start: 
- Broccoli strombili: broccoli raab and cheese in bread 
- Salami stromboli: better flavor with the fatty meat
- Ciabatta: doughy 
- Focaccia: good olive oil flavor

These came with mascarpone butter (very subtle), lemon olive oil (nice), and an eggplant caponata, which I liked.

Pastas: 
- Short rib agnolotti: better with some extra cheese. The first few bites were good, but it got pretty monotonous, and I wish they had a smaller portion of this. It was pretty rich
- Tagliatelle: with lots of vegetables. guanciale, and a truffle zabaglione. I wasn't expecting much from this dish, but the textures and the flavors turned out to be really good

Sides: 
- Mushrooms: a pretty good portion, slightly oily, but good flavor 
- Cauliflower: I liked the gremolata on top, and it actually went well with the agnolitti since the pasta was so rich

We tried ordering some cocktails, but most were pretty unremarkable, and they definitely weren't the craft cocktails I was hoping for.  Food came out shockingly quickly, and I actually wish they had slowed it down a bit rather than bringing it all at once, since things got cold. 

The view of the Bellagio fountains at night was beautiful (we got a seat by the window)..  While the food was not bad, it wasn't as great as I expected, and I doubt the Vegas version does the original Scarpetta justice."}
{"text":"I was visiting Vegas with a group of girls and wanted to eat at one of Vegas's top restaurants.  Searching through Yelp, Scarpetta seemed like a good choice.  I knew it was more expensive but from the reviews I was assuming it was worth it.  I definitely do not think it was.

The food was good, but not worth the price tag.  The pastas were the best part so if you do make it to Scarpetta I would suggest sticking to one of the pastas.  The total bill for the 6 of us was around $500.  We ordered a few drinks and a couple bottles of wine and though I don't have anything about the food to complain about I just don't think it was worth $500.  Normally when I have a meal with that price point I am expecting some experimentation with foods or unique pairings.  Scarpetta did not try anything new.  Steaks, typical pastas, decent portions, but nothing new.  

There are so many choices for restaurants in Vegas so I just can't recommend this one."}
{"text":"Actually quite a nice experience here.  We had a light early dinner here in the bar/lounge area.  We were not allowed in the main dining hall due to a friend's attire (he had just got out of Marquee, their pool club).

I don't even fine italian food very often, but color me happy here.  The bread basket was awesome!  They had a salami bread in there... ask for extra :)  The olive tapenade they served it with was also stellar.  I could eat that stuff alone.

Ordered the duck + foie gras ravioli.  It was really good.  Friends ordered the spaghetti due to some rave reviews from my friend who had been here before.  I thought the spaghetti was good, but not $25 good.  The duck+foie gras ravioli was possibly worth the $27 they charged for it.

We sat in the lounge, so maybe didn't get the full dining experience, so charging the full dining room price for lounge food knocked the experience down some. 

Almost a 5 star place imo."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. My review of the NYC location received 5 stars. As of now my wife & I visited 2 different Scarpetta locations both NYC & Las Vegas & while both restaurants were great, Scarpetta in NYC blew me away!!! This time I tried the infamous Scott Conant spaghetti & must say, it was really good. The flavors were alive & the pasta was perfectly al dente. Very good. Still, the NYC location is better. Even the bread basket was slightly off in Las Vegas but still good. I guess the difference in chefs changed things a little. Not to mention service was a little lifeless & cold. Still I'm affectionate about Scarpetta. In NYC that is lol."}
{"text":"Even better the second time around, had the prix fixe menu again. Our waiter Mike was outstanding and really added to the great dining experience."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night and I agree with most of the reviews on yelp the food and service did not disappoint from start to finish.  We started with some cocktails a White Russian and the berry smash.  For appetizers we had the yellowtail crudo and the scallops oh my..... the yellow tail melted in my mouth and the scallops were perfectly cooked.  We shared the world famous spaghetti and the spiced NY strip the spaghetti was perfectly cooked and let me tell you I'm not a fan of spaghetti but this was really good the sauce kinda tasted more like a vodka sauce.  I would definitely get again but next time with the mini meatballs.  The NY strip was good but I think if we are ever in Vegas again we would try the filet or the brazino.  For desert I had the coconut pan a cotta and my son picked chocolate cake with the toasted almond ice cream.  One word to describe the dessert.....decadent..... oh so good.  One of the better meals we have had in Vegas.  Will definitely be back here the next time we are in Vegas.  And oh our waiter Michael was attentive, professional and patient we couldn't of asked for a better waiter."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!! Great service, ambiance and delicious food.

I was originally a bit turned off by the poor service of the hostess taking our reservation over the phone, but once we arrived the staff (especially our waiter, Mike) was very friendly and accommodating. We loved the ambiance: dim lighting, candles on the tables and stylish decor. We requested a table with a view of the Bellagio fountains. It was really nice being able to look out from time to time even though there's a big bar on the window right at eye-level that makes it difficult to watch the fountain show without needing it lean over awkwardly.

Food: Overall, we really enjoyed our meal! Though there were a couple items I'd recommend against, we loved most of the dishes we tried. Here's a quick review of each item we ordered:

APPETIZERS

- Beet Salad: I enjoyed this, but it was my least favorite of the apps we ordered and could have used more beets.

- Roasted Sea Scallops: If you like seafood, this dish is a must! SO GOOD. It was my favorite item we ordered, and my mouth is watering just thinking about it.

- Creamy Polenta: Another amazing dish! Creamy, buttery perfection.

ENTREES

- Spaghetti: My boyfriend loved this! He said it was the best spaghetti he's had here in the states. The noodles and sauce reminded him of spaghetti in Venice, Italy. :-)

- Mediterranean Branzino: I was disappointed in this dish. The fish was bland and the overall flavor was nothing special.

DESSERTS

- Amedei Chocolate Cake: Loved this!! The only thing that would have made it better is more gelato. It only comes with a tiny scoop and goes quickly with how chocolaty the cake is. Simple solution: request extra gelato while ordering.

- Zeppole (with nutella center and vanilla sauce): We debated over getting this and splitting the two different desserts or just getting two chocolate cakes (which we knew we'd love). I'm so glad decided to give it a try as it ended up being our favorite!! I'd definitely recommend it to others dining here."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian food I've had in this country in a very long time.  The wild mushroom polenta was creamy, rich, and very flavorful.  My husband and I went with the pasta.  He had the sheep milk ricotta agnoletti and I had the spare rib agnoletti.  Both were savory and melt in your mouth good.  For dessert we had the bombolini, which were quite delicious.  

The service was excellent and I disagree with a previous yelper who said service came with a serious attitude.  Our server was kind, helpful, and not at all pretentious.

The only thing that I would like to see on their very extensive wine list is more mid-range bottle options.  There were hardly any bottles of wine under $100.00."}
{"text":"Incredible food and fantastic staff and owner! If you find yourself in Inglewood, this spot is a must!"}
{"text":"Best dining view in the Cosmo.

We went here to enjoy dessert and coffee. We were sat in front across from the bar in a private booth. The dessert was delicious! Chocolate cake with gelato and Carmel sauce. Out of this world. My husband enjoyed dessert as well which looked like doughnuts filled with Nutella. The food was so delicious we wanted to come back, however they close down for 10 days prior to the holiday season. Our waiter was so kind as to give us a tour of the restaurant dining room that overlooked the Bellagio fountains. They also have 2 private rooms. One for events and another that is the chefs table. We got a tour of the kitchen which is impressive and impeccable. The exterior doesn't do the size of the restaurant justice. It's full scale and top notch. Our waiter recommended the pasta for next time, since we already had eaten prior to our visit. Due to their Holiday closing, we took his advice and tried the DOCG next door which was amazing. Next time we find ourselves in Vegas we will definitely eat here and if possible reserve the chefs table."}
{"text":"By FAR my favorite pizza in the city!
My group of girlfriends have been going to 500 Cucina exclusively for the last couple of years.
We used to alternate where we would eat, but after a while it was clear that 500 was everyone's favorite!
Just thinking about their pizza makes me drool.  Fantastic crust - not too thin, not too thick, just the right amount of chewiness yet still light.
The toppings are 5 star and their sauce is light and flavorful.
I always get the Diavolina with spicy jalapenos. I think they are marinated or fire grilled or something but they are soft, fresh, and abundant.
The pasta looks amazing too - the porcini pasta is a huge bowl of fresh noodles, tomato sauce and tons of mushrooms.
On Saturday night they have live music, but I have yet to experience it.
Also there's a lot of free street parking near by, as it's on the west end of Inglewood."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing, honestly mind blowing. But service was horrible. I came here with my two girlfriends for a birthday and we weren't checked on once for the 45 to an hour that we were here. Our server, Giampaolo walked by our table multiple times and never asked how the food was or how we were doing or if we needed anything. I come to a nice restaurant to be treated with respect and not looked down because of my age. I understand we look young and you may think that we won't tip you well but I'm in the bar industry and he would have gotten well taken care of, for sure. I always tip well. He had overheard me talking to my girls about the situation and then tried to not have me pay for the wine to make up for it, without saying something about the horrible service. It's very upsetting when you expect good service and you get belittled."}
{"text":"This place is a great restaurant all around!  Great view, great ambiance, and great service.  We where seated with a great view of the fountain show at Bellagio.  I usually don't like Italian food, too much garlic.  But after this meal I fell in love with it all over again.  The Oysters-West Coast where amazing, the Spaghetti was delicious, and I cant rave enough about the Mediterranean Branzino!  The meal was excellent! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really good Italian food. It may depend on what you order because mine was outstanding and my wife's was simply good but for a non-Italian food lover like myself, I was duly impressed.

The decor was very nice. The tables are a little tight so if you need to navigate through the room, you may have to turn sideways or take an odd path. My wife and I were seated at a two seat table overlooking the Bellagio fountains. She got a beautiful view of the fountains and I got a view of a wall. Other than those two things, The ambience and atmosphere were very nice.

I had the beef tartare appetizer and the lobster pasta and they were both off the hook. The handmade pasta is the real deal. My wife had the oysters appetizer and swordfish. Both were very good but not out of this world. 

The service was nice and accommodating. 

May depend on what you order but, based in my experience, I give it a smiley face!"}
{"text":"I ate here the first week of July and had the pork chop.  The pork chop was so fatty and juicy that I ate the whole thing!  The dining area is very cozy and dim with windows that lined the walls.  The waitstaff was friendly and our waiter surprised us with free cookies to congratulate the future bride (not me, someone else!)."}
{"text":"In Las Vegas for a long weekend just a few days after the grand opening, i ended up at Scarpetta for a late dinner seating. The concierge at the Cosmopolitan hotel was about as nice and as accommodating as you could hope to have and she hooked me and my smoking hot date up. The place looks amazing and i dont now who they thought we were but we got the million dollar table. It must have been that new Calvin Klein dress i was wearing that made them think i was deserving of a table that overlooked the Bellagio fountains. I even asked my hot date if he tipped for that table, he swore he didn't. Whatever I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth i just enjoyed the amazing beautiful view and got ready to eat. 

The service... Impeccable. Charming on the ball waiter with not too much sass but just enough chit chat. The food was prompt and delicious. I had the creamy truffle polenta and  super yummy black macaroni with lobster and Mr handsome across the table from me had the goat which was really good too. I know because even though i dont eat goat cuz i think its gross, he made me taste it and it was.. well, really good. And that's from a goat hater! The wine list is deep but not over complicated, even a wine Jr leauger like myself could find my way around it.

It was a real romantic fairytale night out, exactly what you think fine dinning should be. It was fancy with out being stuck up, tasty with out being weird. Scarpetta LV is a real winner."}
{"text":"Even though the food was good (not on par with the NY location though), I can't give more than one star because the service sucked. 
So it's Restaurant Week in Vegas. I wanted some pasta and Scarpetta's RW menu online looked good. It was our last night there and we had to catch our flight, so we booked the earliest table possible. We walk in and are handed the regular menu, no RW menu. We're sort of hungover and tired and I think maybe i read the dates wrong, so we go ahead and order off the regular menu. No big. 
Then other tables start coming in. They are all given the RW menu enthusiastically. I ask our waiter if it is RW. He says yes, we just started it tonight. I ask why we weren't given the chance to participate--it IS for charity, after all. 
He says, oh...ummm...well...it's by INVITATION ONLY. 
Waiter, you are a LIAR. 
Oh, really?, I say with an eyebrow. 
Yep, sorry, he says, and walks off. 
Just say you f'd up, and comp our dessert or something. Don't treat me like I'm some idiot. 
I wonder what Scott Conant would say."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a group for work.
The best appetizer was the grilled octopus.
I had the lamb, it was terrible.  Dry and about 5 pieces.  Not good at all.
Colleagues said veal chops were good.
Wine sucked.  Their suggestions were crap.
I'd go back for the appetizer, nothing else.
The service was really good and they were very attentive.
Seems very overrated and overpriced."}
{"text":"If you are let looking for the best dining experience come to Scarpetta. The GM Mario made our night with his exquisite staff. Luis was our waiter and took the best care of us from start to finish with his stellar recommendations. The sommelier Kyle served us the best wine and will forever remember this dinner with great friends. Thank you Mario and Scarpetta staff for everything that you do"}
{"text":"I'd have to agree with the other reviews on how amazing this place was. service was top notch. food was fantastic. drinks were delish! definitely exceeded my expectations of food, service, and beautiful view of the strip and bellagio fountains. 

Drinks: the bartender knows how to make his drinks. my sister got the berry smash which was made with fresh fruit. very yummy! not too sweet and just the right amount of fruity. I got an old fashion. I've been searching las vegas for the best old fashion and this place wasn't too bad. only thing lacking was a cherry

Food: 
1) braised short ribs with root veggie and risotto- the risotto was a perfect pairing for this dish. it was super delish! if the meat was tender enough to cut with a fork i would say perfect. don't get me wrong it was still tender, but i think this dish would be PERFECT if it were just a tad more tender
2) sushi slices- pass on the raw fish. save room for the other stuff (good and fresh but there is so much other stuff to try)

3) roasted scallop- I'd have to say this was my fave of the night. i have a thing about scallops. they always seem to disappoint. but SW at the Wynn and Scarpetta have won me over with these amazing scallops. YUMMMMMM

4) polenta with truffle mushroom- i love mushrooms and this went perfect with the polenta. it came in two separate pots that you would mix together. super fab. it seems like an odd side dish for the food but GET IT ANYWAY!

Pastas:
5) spaghetti with tomato and basil- i wasn't impressed by this basic spaghetti that a lot of yelpers raved about. but the noodles were really good. home made noodles a little bit chewy and more dense than the standard spaghetti noodle you make at home
6) duck and foie gras ravioli- i'm not a big fan of foie gras but everyone at the table loved this dish. they said it was the best pasta dish we got.
7) stracci- lobster, crab, shrimp, and basil- this was my fav pasta dish. it was bursting with flavor. the shellfish was perfectly delicious. MUST TRY

8) lamb- my goodness this was the best lamb i ever had. if i didn't know any better i wouldn't even have known i was eating lamb. there was almost zero gamey taste that is commonly associated with lamb. YUMMMMMM

dessert:
we had about 4 desserts. but the best i think was the gingerbread pear crisp. get a little side of gelato/ice cream. it was so good. i was stuffed to the brim at this point but i had to have more!

we also had some fish but i would go with the other amazing food rather than the fish dish. would love to come back here. its quite expensive but also quite yummy. my tummy was more than satisfied when i left :)"}
{"text":"No Reservations....Packed - Living like a VIP!   We had a group of 7 and NO Reservation around 8 PM - What to Do - After a 10 minute wait, we were ushered into the Private Dining Room!  I must say - FABULOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE!  

As we wait...we see the CHEF himself in the house.... What a Night!

- The drinks were fabulous!

Things I tasted... Heirloom Beet Salad and Crispy Fritto Misto (This is a MUST - Perfectly prepared and delicious)  / Black Fettuccine /  Pici / Coconut Panna Cotta (I recommend ordering 2 or 3 of these for yourself - so Yummy!

We will be back! oh... Can't forget the BREAD!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite pasta places in Calgary. The pizza is pretty good to.

Been here a few times and more recently I'm hooked on their Gnocchi Alla Panna. It is just that good. Had it again for lunch the other day.

Their pizza is lovely. Shared the Rochetta a couple weeks ago with a friend and we were not disappointed. Their Triple Pig 1 and 2 from YYC Pizza Week were equally delicious.

We enjoy watching Gennaro cooking and chatting away with all his customers. His stories are endless and his passion for his food always shines. Husband and I shared the 500 Fries and we were seriously fighting for the last crumbs.

It's a beautiful restaurant in Inglewood and we've always had great service and great food. Worth the visit the next time you want pasta - or pizza!"}
{"text":"Sheer brilliance. The short rib agnolotti is worth the trip back. Service was impeccable and the wine selection divine."}
{"text":"This review is actually about an experience i had on Valentines day. First of all, i made the reservations over a week in advance, After reading all of the reviews here, I requested to be sat next to the windows to see the fountains. Upon arriving there, they sat us in the 2nd row from the window. I asked about it and they said it was 'first come first serve', even though i had requested it in my reservations. Luckily, the couple next to us heard and switched us seats because they had already eaten there before and seen the view. It was really sweet of the couple. We actually had to wait for our menu, even though we had already sat down, which was really weird. It took maybe 10 minutes or so for them to give us menus. 

We ordered the yellowtail appetizer. For entrees, I ended up ordering the short rib agnolotti and my boyfriend ordered the chicken with a side of brussel sprouts.  The yellowtail was so so, the fish was fresh but it didn't really have enough umph. The bread course was AMAZING. They had mascarpone butter, citrus oil and an olive tapenade that was to die for. i wasn't crazy about the agnolotti...I was actually pretty disappointed. There no actual sauce to the pasta, which for me was a misstep. Short rib and marrow are in nature very rich and oily but when i had it for leftovers, the oil was excessive to the point of it being disgusting. The brussel sprouts were the star of the night for me. Side dishes aren't usually that special but i could eat an entire bucket of these things if someone let me. I liked the chicken my boyfriend had but he didn't care for it. We ended the night with the nutella and vanilla bombolis and those were super delicious.

All in all, i think i would go again, but i would definitely order different things. I know he's known for his spaghetti and i totally regret to getting that."}
{"text":"I was actually really excited about this place, but to much avail, this place is mediocre at best.

I really think this place is over-hyped. The food here is marginal and the prices exorbitant than its actually worth. I got the duck and foie gras ravioli, which was ok but not quite flavorful. After trying cucina enoteca in Irvine, CA, I always have to compare every italian place to it and Scarpetta cannot compete. Cucina Enoteca is always a good half price cheaper! 

I also am NOT a fan of their service. My wine was forgotten and only came at the tail end of my dinner. For $18 a glass, this is unacceptable. I know waiters work long hours but it seem like everyone was crabby who worked there.

I'll have to say though, the window view is pretty good as it faces the fountain of the Bellagio."}
{"text":"Scarpetta has a very small happy hour window, I think it was Mon-Fri 5:30-7:00pm and I was determined to try it this week...just made it under the wire. We had the creamy delicious Polenta with mushrooms, warm assorted olives, fresh farm salad, burrata crostini, seafood frito misto, bone marrow ravioli, and wine...it was a fantastic sampler, all was delicious and exactly as described in their menu for just $7 a dish/cocktail."}
{"text":"The environment is cool and classy.  You can get away with casual attire, but a little dressier would fit better.  This is definitely an option for a romantic dinner as well.

The service team was attentive and friendly.  The bread basket is filled with tasty options.

For my meal I ordered the Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti.  It was very good.  It also has brown butter, horseradish and bread crumbs as part of the meal.  The horseradish is very subtle, so do not get scared away by that.  The bone marrow helps give it deep flavor.  The meal is very good.  The portion is modest, so definitely consider an appetizer, soup or salad to pair with it."}
{"text":"I have no intention to return to Scarpetta after having dined there last night on the pre-fixe menu for Restaurant Week. First I will state what is warranting the one star: a wonderful Chianti and delicious heirloom tomatoes. 

This is what I was served:

Heirloom Tomato Salad - I thought the presentation was lovely and all the flavors were good and spread out. The heirloom tomatoes were very tasty. I was not disappointed with this dish.

Aged Sirloin Beef; Potato Gnocchi, Wild Mushrooms, Parmigiano & Barolo Ragu - I am fairly certain my dish did not have ANY mushrooms in it and I was very disappointed in this fact. Was it because we were dining on the RW menu? I guess mushrooms only go to those paying full price? The sirloin was O.K.. nothing special. I will admit the waiter suggested I get it medium and I opted for medium-well, maybe my mistake here - but the fact the meat had quite a bit of fat on it and gristle was NOT my fault.

Amadei Chocolate Cake Toasted Almond Gelato & Salted Caramel Sauce - The cake was very rich and I was pleased with it, however I felt as though it was something that could be served up at an Applebee's for goodness sake, not a fine dining establishment.

On to the even worse (because the food was actually okay) was the service. Our waiter was horrid. Just absolutely, down-right inattentive and spaced out beyond belief. He was an older gentlemen. Mistakes made:

- Incredibly slow service
- Offering us a wine menu, but not taking our wine order until we gave it to him ourselves
- The wine took forever to arrive and in the mean time he did not return to take our meal orders
- Had tap water poured into our water cups that were filled with the water we PAID FOR
- He did a poor-ass job of describing the meals, as did the others serving us
- Just the most bland service EVER; did not ask us how our food was, did not chat with us at all, just did not care in general

Was it because we were there on the RW Menu? Maybe. And if that is the way an establishment runs a wonderful event for a good cause for a charity than I have absolutely no intention of ever returning to order off the menu. There are better places I can go in Vegas to have fine Italian dining. Scarpetta is not one of them."}
{"text":"First time on a recommendation, plus I have eaten at Mora in Phx which was excellent. Jason was our server and ordered for me. Meal was amazing to say the least and my pork chop was over cooked. There was 2 of us and we split the burrata which is a MUST have. Also had the scallops with Foie Gras as an app. Deeelish. Entrees were the Branzini, Agnolotti and the chop. Disappointed in the chop but had plenty of food even though I sent back the chop and didn't ask to replace it. The highlight was dessert. Tried the cheesecake, donuts and the Budino. OMG the Budino was probably the. Eat dessert we have EVER had. Definite must try and we are foodies who grew up in the restaurant business back East. Ask for Jason to guide you through the menu!  Cheers."}
{"text":"They don't open until 6pm, so we were concerned we wouldn't make our 8pm show at the palms hotel. But the service was very fast. so fast, it made it pretty obvious that our lardo wrapped shrimp was precooked albeit very, very tasty. but a bit dry. the cocktails were delicious...the agnolotti rich and delicious, but the ny steak was the highlight & perfectly cooked. we finished with  the banana souffle and coffee. the coffee was great but the souffle was more of a meringue than a typical dessert souffle. also, a highlight was the attentive service. actually the best we've ever had in vegas! thanks to garvin. we had 6pm reservations and were out by 7:05pm."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Scott Conant from Chopped fame but I have to say the Las Vegas outpost of his iconic NYC restaurant just did not live up to the hype.  I went with a group of guys and we ordered the tasting menu.  They were nice enough to allow us to order it on a Friday night since it is usually not offered on that night of the week.  We tasted 8 dishes for $110 pp.  The quantity of food was great - really full at the end of the meal - but most of the dishes were just ok.

The real highlight for me was the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms.  Wow, that was delicious.  Probably the creamiest polenta I've ever had and it paired so nicely with the earthiness of the truffles and mushrooms.   The chocolate cake served for the dessert course was also terrific, served with toasted almond gelato.  Too bad I was so full by that time I could only have a couple of bites.  Nothing else was particularly memorable.  

Disappointing for me was the restaurant's signature spaghetti - a seemingly simple preparation of pasta, fresh tomatoes and basil.  It arrived very simply plated -  a perfect cylinder mold of spaghetti covered by a clear plastic cloche that I suppose is meant to preserve the freshness of the preparation or perhaps to concentrate the aroma.  The cloches are removed with a flourish releasing nice smells of tomato and basil.  The pasta was a bit overcooked and the sauce, while wonderfully creamy (how do they do that?) was just too sweet, as if Chef Conant and Chef Boyardee had a bastard love-child.

Another disappointment was the black cod.  In the past I have found this fish to be among the most delicious owing to its high fat content and buttery texture and flavor.  Scarpetta's rendition of this fish, pan-roasted with concentrated tomatoes and roasted fennel, was so overcooked that it was unrecognizable as black cod.  Just a piece of fish.

Other dishes were a bit more successful including the raw preparation of yellowtail and tuna, the diver scallops, the short rib/bone marrow agnolotti and the duck breast.

The wine list is voluminous and expensive.  The cocktail menu offers some nice selections.

There is certainly a lot of eye candy to be enjoyed at this swank place in the Cosmo.  However, one annoying thing was the lighting.  Over every table there is a large fixture containing multiple yellow/gold colored lights.  This lighting casts the food in a weird color and makes taking pictures of the food impossible.  All the food looks bad in the pictures I took - I suppose that's no surprise that the pictures were a disappointment too."}
{"text":"Decor is amazing. They have a beautiful view of the strip and the interior is quite cozy with the low light setting.

The food in general was pretty good. The scallop and spaghetti were both so yummy! The noodle was slightly too al dente for me, but the sauce was so amazing. The Duck Foie Gras Ravioli had a strong foie gras taste to it. I couldn't really taste the duck. My least favorite of the night had to be the veal dish. The meat was dry and very lackluster.

The most amazing thing was the bread basket. It comes with a variety of dips and breads. There is one warm bread with salami embedded in the inside. I wish I have a whole basket of that!

Anywho, I would definitely come back for the bread and to try the spaghetti again. :)"}
{"text":"I had a really great experience here. We went here for our birthday dinner and had amazing service from start to finish. Jason was our server and did an outstanding job making our birthday dinner special. We had the best seat in the house with a direct view of the strip. We took advantage of the opportunity by taking lots of pictures, obvi. We started out with some kushi oysters. I love oysters so it was a must, very fresh and sweet. The lobster pici was absolutely delicious, tasty, complex, flavorful, and very unique. For dessert we had the bomboloni with Nutella and the chocolate soufflé. We also got a cute little sampler of tea cookies and biscotti for our joint birthday. Overall, would definitely come back again for the food and service."}
{"text":"I have a select group of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. It is a small list of places I would go every visit, and even though I like to try new places, my special list always beckons...

The time has come to add a new place to this Elite list...welcome Scarpetta.

Reservation made for Christmas dinner 2015 (made it 3 days in advance), located on level 3 of the Cosmopolitan and we requested a window seat overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Upon being greeted by the lovely set of hostesses (who were very classy mind you), our request was honored, and our table was AMAZING.

We had some awesome servers helping us, our main waiter was Garvin (I hope I spelled it right). He was extremely nice, great attitude, plenty of \"just right\" conversation, funny, personable, and I could not have enough praise for his knowledge of the menu, Las Vegas cuisine, and his general awareness of what it means to be a good host for a restaurant. He gets 5 stars alone!

The ambiance is dark, seductive, and enchanting. The place is mostly \"quiet\" and intimate, with dim lighting, gorgeous wood flooring and well-appointed décor. 

We ordered a couple drinks. I had a variation of the Moscow Mule  and it was superb. My gf (who always takes forever to pick a wine) had two she was interested in, and our waiter brought both for her tasting. She finally chose a Pinot Noir, and really enjoyed it. 

Our appetizers were:

- Warm Beet Salad...AMAZING IN EVERY WAY! The temp was perfect. The beets were soft and tasty, the shaved parsnip was bitter and palate pleasing.

- Tuna and Avocado. This was divine. Tuna, Avo, micro greens...just perfect.

The bread basket (free):

- Yes, I will rave about the free bread. I don't normally even eat bread but it was Xmas Dinner so sue me! Haha...the stuffed \"Stromboli Bread\" oh my god. good. The sourdough, the ciabatta, the olive oil and rosemary squares...holy hell on a stick Batman...!! The bread was delicious and it came with an eggplant tapenade, marscapone butter, and a light olive oil...oh man...wow.

The Pasta:

- I got the Short Rib Agnolotti.  The flavor depth of the wagyu short rib, the bone marrow broth, the dark rich sauce and the fresh mini-ravioli pasta...was amazing. It didn't look like a huge portion, but looks were deceiving...it was a lot of food. This is now a TOP 5 dish favorite in Las Vegas. 

- My lady got a Gluten-Free variation on the Spaghetti & Sauce. It was the same tomato and basil fresh sauce, with gf noodles and they added just enough garlic, olive oil and shaved cheese to it. This was simply an amazing spaghetti and sauce. I mean...wow again.  Simple, flavorful, and filling. 

On the side:

- We added Brussels sprouts to our mains and they were great. Toasted macrona almonds with just a bit of smokiness. Lemon oil, garlic, oh man these sprouts were luscious. I am going to try to make these at home. This side alone was so worth it (seriously). Try them.

***  ***  ***  ***

All of the food came out in good order to not clutter the table. The servers and staff always knew when to clear a plate or fill something. They were ever-present but not annoying. Honestly, the service was perfect. This was a great Christmas dinner, and one to remember for so many reasons...they even brought out a light dessert course for us since it was my birthday the week prior (with a lemon bar, a berry jelly candy, a chocolate, and little cookie).

If ever I write 1,000 words for a Yelp! review let it be Scarpetta. People, you cannot go wrong here. With drinks, appetizer, salad, and two entrees, we were around $150, throw in a well deserved great tip, and it was a delightful dinner, perfectly executed for under $200 in an amazing seat to see the Bellagio show and enjoy a quiet and intimate atmosphere. 

I'm coming back soon, I promise!"}
{"text":"The reviews are all true.  4 of us had dinner there this past weekend and we can honestly say everything was amazing.  From the bread and appetizers through to dessert, we were passing our plates and sharing as every selection was beyond delicious.  The highlights were the spaghetti and the polenta.  We will definitely be back on our next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Overall the place is doing it right with the ambiance and service. Our servers were spectacular; they took the time to converse with us since it wasn't busy yet and it was very pleasant to get to know them. Can't remember their names but they have tattoos hidden under your uniforms (we were chatting about tattoos and they showed us theirs haha).The hostess on the other hand had some attitude problem when we asked to be seated some where else that happen to be right next to where waiters would enter in and out of. I'm still wondering why she sat us there when more than half of the room was empty...

Anyways, on to the good stuff that matters. THE FOOD. 

I had the Spiced Rubbed NY Steak. It tasted fine; however, after sitting for 10 minutes, the steak started to taste really dry. The spices on the steak were great though...I'm just sad that halfway through my steak it started to taste dry. Maybe it was old steak. ::shrugs:: I've had steak at Delmonico and it was significantly better over there. For a renowned restaurant, I was expecting more. 

My boyfriend had the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli. This dish was amazing! I'm a huge fan of liver but this dish was out of this world. Mind you, I'm not big on italian food. The cream that it was submersed in was light and wasn't thick like many other italian places I've dined at. This is a must if you're ever a first timer here!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The ambiance was nice, but the room was a little dim. I had the duck foie gras ravioli--it was quite tasty. And I liked the bread. The service was alright. Not once did the waiter come back and ask how we liked our dinner. The place was quite busy-so make reservations."}
{"text":"We chose this place due to the high recommendation here on yelp and I'd think to thank everyone for not letting me down!  The service was top notch and the food was extraordinary.  You must order the pasta....it's so fresh!"}
{"text":"service is the worst I've experienced in Vegas, food was not bad but loses it's flavor with bad service, Scott Conant the owner needs to read these reviews and start screening staff. I for sure will never step foot into this sad excuse for a restaurant ever again. A week later I was in Beverly Hills with the same group of friends and we saw Scarpetta, we avoided the restaurant and ate elsewhere, proving how lousy service means loss of business."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend Scarpetta to anyone traveling to Vegas. This was one of the best Italian restaurants I have ever been to. They have one of the best views of the fountains and the strip. I had the short rib agnolotti and the chocolate cake for dessert. The pasta was like little pillows of heaven. In addition, Neal, Mario and the rest of the staff were amazing. Five stars!"}
{"text":"I picked this place for a special occasion. 
We were seated in the corner next to the windows with a view of Bellagio's water park. We were greeted by Mike, very professional and easy to talk to. The cocktail and wine list had a lot of variety and good choices. The menu was the same, variety and delicious choices. Mike made a couple of great recommendations, I went with his advice and was not disappointed. We both loved everything that was served. I would definitely come here again and would request Mike. 
Thank you again"}
{"text":"Great ambience, lighting and music. Good service. Weird Caprese, felt cheap with little cherry tomatoes and the cheese was ultra soft like raw egg whites. Prawns were good; I enjoyed the sambuca sauce."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!! Everything I've eaten here has been delicious. I've been here a few times and have had pasta, steak, Kobe rib cap steak everything has been awesome. I die for their creamy polenta and their Stromboli bread. Every time I come to the Cosmo I have to eat here!"}
{"text":"Oh my WOW. So very good. We came here with friends that have been to Scott's restaurants in New York and LA and loved them both. And our food was amazing! First off the bread they give is amazing. You get various traditional Italian breads including stromboli. The olive oil butter was fantastic with it. We then got the endive and apple salad and polenta. The salad was fresh and delicious but the polenta was heaven!! Even the mushrooms (I only tried the juice from them) was great. I could eat that polenta everyday. As for dinner, we tried various things but most of us tried the spaghetti. It was funny because my friends recommended it and I almost laughed with them recommending the most basic dish on the amazing menu but I listen. Glad I did- I now have dreams about the spaghetti. I actually asked to go back the next day and get it again but we didn't have time. I have now scoured the internet to get the recipe. Very very highly recommended. We also tried the Pici and Agnolotti. Both were to die for. The agnolotti was actually a huge hit at our table. It is heavy and rich but just melts in your mouth. 

This place was great and the service was very good. Honestly not a bad thing to say about it. I live in So. Cal and am planning a trip to go back to his LA restaurant as soon as I can."}
{"text":"3.5 stars- food was really good but over priced. I had a plate with chicken in it, the short rib pasta, and Palenta. If I was chief Ramsy I would say that the mushrooms on the Palenta were too hard. 

Basically you are paying for location on the strip.  

Service was ok (a little on the slow side). Waiter was really nice."}
{"text":"Among my favourite Italian mini chains. The spaghetti is out of control good. Cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Expensive but worth it. A very short menu that was fun to share items off of with others in our party so we could all try different things. Great food with a unique flair. Their bread choices were very unique including a bread with meat in it.  They need more servers. Our bar and food service was slow. They only had one bartender working, while she was great, no one could keep up alone with the volume of a full restaurant. We liked the location with its view. Also they presented the food to you when it came very well. We will go back."}
{"text":"Great service!! Me and my lady shared spaghetti (tomato and basil), broccoli (seasoned with garlic) and braised short rib appetizer!! Good proportions, and yummy bread with three different types of spread. I could eat five bowls!!"}
{"text":"I can not say more great things about Scarpetta.  The food and service are perfect.  Yes, its pricey but you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Had a phenomenal dinner here. I got the black pasta and my boyfriend got the beef ravioli and both were great. If you go you should definitely make a reservation because they get booked. Of course we were able to sit in a spacious lounge area and eat dinner without an issue. Service was quick and attentive. Overall delicious food and a good time!"}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant in Las Vegas. 
Such an amazing pastas, great fish entrées and an awesome view to Bellagio mountains. This restaurant 'hiding' in a small hall at the 3rd floor at the Cosmopolitan and when you go inside it's a huge restaurant."}
{"text":"When I was browsing through Yelp to choose a nice restaurant before going to see the Banda MS concert, I decided to tryout Scarpetta. I wanted to compare it to the other Italian restaurants in town. Scarpetta has a magnificent view, the customer service was excellent, and my Veal Chop Parmesan was not cooked thoroughly. We started our evening with some fresh oysters which were complemented well with a bottle of white wine. My guest had a chicken breast, and she said it was good. I brought my concern with Julian, my server and he did apologize on behalf of the restaurant's inconvenience. Julian brought my guest and I complementary dessert which we both enjoyed. Overall I think Scarpetta was excellent but I think the food at Nora's is far better tasting ( well at least the Veal). Scarpetta by far has the best view compared to the other Italian restaurants I've tried out in town. Would I come again? Probably. Did I get for what I pay for? Yes. Is, is the best Italian restaurant in Las Vegas? It has potential!"}
{"text":"The reason this review is not five stars is because our great experience was tainted by the negligence and poor service given by the sommelier. 

After ordering our bottle with him we were offered a taste of champagne, but after out first course came and went he hadnt returned with our bottle so we complain to the server. She comes by with a glass of champagne as a peace offering while she tracks the somm down. Our main course is half eaten and he walks over with the bottle half open and apologizes for forgetting us. He didn't ask us if we still wanted it, especially considering that dinner was 15 mins from being done, he just opened it.

We get the bill and the bottle's not on it so we thought that was a nice gesture for makes us having to wait all dinner. He comes back and says he forgot to put the bottle on the bill and rang our cards with the corrected bill... I'm like wtf is wrong w you. He drops the check with someone else's card and bill. We have to send it back. 

I know it's just two ladies so our bill was only $200 but still... Wtf is wrong with you. Nice service should come no matter how high roller your table is. He was terrible. The hotels getting an email about it too."}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience!!! Our waiter was very knowledgable and attentive to our requests and needs! 
We had FETTUCCINE  with lamb ragu, broccoli rabe & pecorino to start with .... It was very good
 Main course: PRIME FILET OF BEEF with potato-lardo purée, rainbow chard & barolo sauce and SPICED DUCK BREAST with eggplant gratin, pine nuts & duck jus!
 Both were very tasty and balanced in flavors!
For dessert we had  NUTELLA & VANILLA BOMBOLONI (nutella ganache, banana gelato & chocolate shortbread)....... Interesting ........ Didn't impress me much as I was looking for more uniqueness !!!! It  reminded me of donut fi

For drinks we had:
IL DOLCE LIMONE  and San Remo!!!

If you are looking for a romantic dinner with you loved one, this is a very good choice!!!!"}
{"text":"I am forced to drop the star rating from 4 to a 3 because of the lack of consistency, which is a factor at high end restaurants.  Their spaghetti over this past weekend was terrible.

In fact, I actually returned the first batch. It was watery and the noodles were overcooked and broken. The second batch was only slightly better but definitely not the same in flavor, texture and consistency that I experienced in Miami and again in Vegas last fall.

It's still excellent service and probably the prettiest and fanciest restaurant at the Cosmo. They will always hold that title."}
{"text":"My great friend was moving the Australia so I decided to take her to a nice dinner as her 'going away gift'. I figured it was more practical than something she would have to pack, lol. 

We both order some drinks, which were quite strong; I was pleased! We decided to split the endive and apple salad. It was so flavorful and the heirloom beets melted in my mouth. It was the perfect size as I was looking forward to my main course: truffle ravioli (I do not recall the real name of the dish!).  I love truffles and it was like eating something little angels made. I was so happy! We were too full for dessert but the waiter still brought us some petits fours (complements of the chef). The food was simply amazing, every bite was so delectable! 

We also had a view of the Bellagio fountains show and that was very beautiful!

I cannot wait to frequent Scarpetta again (:"}
{"text":"I ate here recently and was very impressed
To start, we shared the braised beef short ribs
What impressed me was that they already brought the dish out seperated into 2 even portions so we did not have to share from 1 bigger plate in the middle
This type of service and attention to detail is always appreciated
Although the meat was tender and the risotto was very nice and different, I wouldn't order this dish again
The portion of meat is very small and it tastes as if just braised in a tomato/stew-type sauce
I was more impressed with the risotto than the meat

However, the entrees were just delicious!
I have the Black Farfalle with lobster ($35 - their most expensive pasta)
This dish is perfect
The pasta seems to be cooked in a lobster broth and tastes of lobster, which was just amazing
Also, they don't overpower it with sauce
There is a dusting of basil breadcrumbs, which are delicious and the pasta and lobster are tossed in a basil, chopped tomato, garlic butter concoction
This is a perfect pasta dish - lobster is tender and meaty, pasta is cooked perfectly, the basil and tomato and garlic go so well
The garlic is even thinly shaved (this reminded me of Goodfellas - if you've ever seen the movie, perhaps you remember how one of the characters would shave the garlic with a razor so thinnly that they said the garlic melted in the oil)

My boyfriend had the black cod, which he thoroughly enjoyed
The fish was cooked perfectly, with a great crispy skin

Unfortunately we didn't have dessert (too full) but I would definitely return and try another pasta creation!"}
{"text":"Before I went there I had read a few yelp reviews and I have to say that I expected something more. Not that it's a bad place, just nothing to write home about.

The interior is very classy and elegant - dark wood, candles and comfortable white couches. The light is soft and dimmed, so it's a perfect spot for romantic, candlelit dinners. As in the majority of such sophisticated Italian restaurants the menu is very short and well-considered. There is no banality there, the flavors are mixed in surprising, interesting ways - you can see that the chef wanted to do something different. They also have a lot of vegetarian and gluten free dishes, which is not so common. The waiter was very professional and knew exactly when the food should be served or taken from the table. He also recommended great drinks and desserts.

The bread they serve as a apetizer is fresh, soft and savoury - delicious. For a main course I decided to try short rib agnolotti with brown butter, horseradish & toasted breadcrumbs. It tasted good, but was a bit on a small side and left me still hungry. My friends' portions were a bit bigger and they were satisfied with the flavors. The really good part were the desserts, we ordered mascarpone cheescake and banana souffle. They were perfect, not as heavy or as sweet as I though. The Berry Smash was also great! I had a few and I have to say there is waaaaaay more alcohol there than in Poland, where I live. It's easy to get tipsy.

So why only an \"ok\" grade? The prices are pretty high and the food is just ok. The concept itself may be interesting but the result is no so great as to overpay. There is probably a lot of Italian restaurants which are just as good or maybe even better."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I've eaten at some pretty incredible places in Vegas, spent a lot more money than I did here, but I absolutely enjoyed myself at Scarpetta just as much at a fraction of the cost. Everything was spot-on for our visit. Despite having made last-minute reservations, we requested and received a booth where all four of us could see the fountains. The appetizers were amazing: we tried the pea soup, polenta, scallops, and short ribs. For entrees, two of us had the duck and foie gras ravioli, which I will be dreaming about for a long time; the aged sirloin; and the spaghetti. One of us had dessert (yeah, that would be me), a coconut panna cotta in a guava soup. Perfect. My only complaint: the wine prices. They are, in a word, astronomical. I expect to pay double retail prices usually, maybe a bit more in Vegas, but Scarpetta is at least quadruple. So my husband chose beer, and I went with two glasses of wine and called it a day, rather than having to sell myself on the Strip for a bottle."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend for the small plate happy hour. The menu was limited, but good. We got the creamy polenta and the foie gras ravioli. The polenta was okay and the ravioli was honestly the best ravioli I had ever eaten. The environment was cool and intimate. We sat in a very secluded booth, which there are about 8 in a row like that. There was a table there too that overlooked the bellagio fountains which would've been neat to sit at with a bigger party. Our drinks were okay and I don't even remember what they were, but there were just three to choose from. 

Overall a cool environment to experience and get some good food and okay drinks for a decent price. And you get to walk through the cosmopolitan which is neat. Would recommend."}
{"text":"The food here was high quality, though slightly small in portion for price, but the service timing was tremendously off for a high quality place which was the biggest setback.  

We waited well over 20 mins for our starter drinks, though randomly one person at our table got a glass of wine, while the rest of us sat waiting, and the timing on everything else with the service was excessively off. Our drinks went unfilled for extended periods of time (not the water) and other things that highlighted a real lack of attention on the server, whether over extended or just lacking, not normal for this standard of restaurant. It is tightly sat with lots of big party tables so perhaps the reach is too much, but food quality wise, it is excellent. It's a bit aggravating to me that the server wasn't around to address drinks and other items we shouldn't had to be looking for him for but was blazing fast to get the bill to us and closed in 30 seconds. 

The one upside was that the service was not aloofly arrogant which can be standard with some places like this in Vegas. 

Random note - I would not recommend the octopus for a group to share."}
{"text":"Amazing.

Fantastic service, food, and ambiance.

Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Delicious, with a nice ambiance. 

The service is attentive. They seem to have a sixth sense about your needs, and take care of things immediately.

The sommelier gave us a very good wine suggestion based on my very limited description of what I would like. Their wall of wine is quite overwhelming, I was very glad for his assistance.  

The prices are a bit steeper; but you go to a place like this for the pleasure of the taste buds; and good taste bud pleasers, need to be rightfully rewarded. 

Everyone at my table, avid lovers of delicious food, loved their meal. 

I, a tasteaholic, will definietly be back for some more.

P.S. I do not care how full you feel, you need to try one of their desserts. It is 100% worth the potential explosion of the stomach."}
{"text":"What a stellar place! Before we begin, the address of 500 Cucina is actually 1003 9th Avenue SE, NOT the address listed on Yelp.

We were a bit lost in the beginning given the incorrect, but luckily, we called the restaurant and someone actually walked out to find us!  Amazing.  Great start to the evening already.

We came on a Monday night at 6:30PM.  It was a bit quiet at first, but the crowds started flow in around 7:00PM. 

Ok on to the food itself.  We ordered three dishes in total. 

First, we had fries with truffle oil to kick off the evening.  These were delicious and we polished these off so quickly that we were tempted to get a second order.

Next, we share one of the pizzas and one of the pasta.  For the pasta, we were recommended the seafood linguine.  I'm not usually a big fan of seafood pasta, but this one was pretty delish.  As for the pizza though, this was amazing. We had the \"cowgirl\" which came with a healthy serving of smoked porschetta and arugula.  The dough was just right, loved every piece of it.

Will be back again with a bigger group (so that we can try all of the other pizzas).

Thank you Yelp for this great find."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. My fave of the trip! We were a group of 8 and they were extremely accommodating of our budget. The waiter never treated us like we were anything less than VIP. We had a amuse Bouche, foie gras/scallop stater and  surf and turf. Nothing was short of amazing"}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance, impeccable service, picture perfect views but underwhelming dishes. Was expecting  palatable flavors of love, however we weren't thoroughly impressed.  They have all the right ingredients, for one exceptional restaurant, maybe the kitchen was off on this particular evening."}
{"text":"Carpaccio.  Need I say more ???    Amazing.  Service is great.  Spaghetti is ALWAYS perfect."}
{"text":"Best. Pastas. Ever.  We showed up at around 5:30p for an early dinner with our son, who just turned 21 (in Vegas!) and were happy to find out they had a social hour until 7:00.  Do not miss on that menu - short rib bone marrow agnolotti and the duck and foie ravioli - literally \"last meal\" worthy.  Also, the pork belly was amazing.  The $7.00/glass Sangiovese was surprisingly great (we ususally don't opt for happy hour wines).  We also ordered The Spaghetti with added meatballs from the regular dinner menu.  It was the best spaghetti we have ever had.  Dessert was the incredible mascarpone cheesecake with a perfect double espresso.  We luxuriated in one of the curved booths close to the entrance which was private but let you observe the comings and goings of the restaurant.  The decor, music, ambiance, etc. is first rate.  Last, but not least, the service was superb.  Friendly, efficient and professional.  This was a true 5/5 dining experience and we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We recently ate at Scarpetta in the private dining room for a family event. While we didn't have a normal menu, our event menu was built off of regular menu items. 

The meal itself was pretty good. The best thing out of the appetizers was the short rib and polenta. 

Best pasta was the duck fois gras ravioli. And the best part of the desert was the cheesecake (oh my god it's the best I've ever had). 

It was pretty good stuff all around."}
{"text":"A few years may have passed, but Scarpetta is just as outstanding as ever.

I dropped by on a Friday night, immediately after a show at The Chelsea had let out.  Thousands of people were descending on Cosmo's P3 restaurant zone all at once, and I had to select a dinner spot as quickly as possible, or else no open seats would be left.  Scarpetta was the ideal choice, since I could squeeze in at the bar.

The place was a madhouse, but I didn't mind.  Service at the bar was just as spot-on as in the dining room.  I was also luckily enough to be seated next to some very friendly and sociable solo diners who *love* talking about food.

I started off with a glass of Riesling, which I sipped while nibbling on some freshly baked bread.  Scarpetta serves one of the finest breadbaskets in Vegas, with abundant olive oil, eggplant tapanade, and whipped mascarpone cheese for spreading.

For my app, I tried the braised beef short rib with farro risotto and a slice of lardo.  Ladies and gentlemen -- you will never taste short rib as tender and delicate as this.  Absolutely perfect.

For my entree, I tried the spaghetti, which is apparently a specialty of the house -- and I can totally see why.  Thick, plump noodles with a smooth and flavorful sauce will totally upend any preconceived notions of what spaghetti should taste like.  You think spaghetti is simple or boring?  Not after Scott Conant has his way with it.  

There are so many fabulous restaurants in the Cosmo that picking a single favorite is close to impossible...but Scarpetta is definitely high on the list!"}
{"text":"While perusing menus for a special dinner in Vegas, I quickly narrowed it to Scarpetta because of their robust vegetarian offerings (both on the regular menu and then an additional veggie menu) and price point. It is less than some of the fanciest restaurants on The Strip and I can now confirm that the food is equally as good.

Ambiance- We chose Scarpetta without even realizing until later that it was located in our hotel (The Cosmopolitan). For as loud as the hotel can be right outside the restaurant, the inside was quiet, calm and classy. The hostess mentioned that we were sitting at her favorite table and we could see why. Our two top overlooked the Bellagio fountain and the strip. It was great. The tables were far enough apart that we didn't feel too close to other diners.

Food- I read a lot about Scott Conant's famous spaghetti 'baseball,' so we had to try it. Our waiter managed our expectations by explaining that the simplicity of the sauce, herbs and fresh made pasta made it delicious. We split all our dishes and this one was easy to share, as they gave us each our own tiny little ball of pasta. It's not a stretch to say that it is in fact, the best spaghetti I have ever tasted. The consistency was perfect and flavors well-balanced. I can assure you I would never spend over $20 on spaghetti anywhere else, but I'd probably do it again at Scarpetta.

I had my eye on a few meat or fish dishes, but honestly the veggie menu easily tempted this carnivore away. I started with the tuna susci (sushi) and it was some of the best I've had. Each piece almost melted in my mouth and the flavors melded nicely together. I was truly sad when it ended.

My girlfriend had the polenta and we both agreed that it was the creamiest we've ever tasted, without being overly rich. And add truffles to anything and each bite turns into heaven. 

We accompanied our spaghetti with another pasta dish off the vegetarian menu, the agnolotti. This was easily my girlfriend's favorite, as each dumpling was filled with (and covered by) the right amount of cheese, cream and truffle. Our meal ended with three warm and perfectly textured zeppole (tiny donuts) and vanilla almond dipping sauce.

The wine pairs were delicious and pours were generous. Our server was down to earth, perfectly attentive (but not overly) and mindful of our needs (both relative to food and time so we could make our show). 

It is unusual for me to return to restaurants in Vegas, as there are so many good ones, but Scarpetta will be my exception. The combination of excellent food, service and price make this one of my new favorite dining haunts."}
{"text":"Well rounded menu
Service felt rushed with little explanation of dishes. 
Good presentation (plates)
Auxiliary staff could use some polishing however."}
{"text":"We've been to (and loved) Scarpetta in NY.  The bread basket there was astounding and so memorable we wanted to come here for that, even 6 years after our visit to the NY location.  We enjoyed our meal here very much (and it's not a bad value for the strip) but the bread basket was definitely less amazing than I remembered.  They still have the meat stromboli, as well as some very good sourdough and the rosemary focaccia, which used to be my favorite but now seems to be made with whole wheat dough and is no longer quite as good.  

We shared two pasta dishes, the duck and foie gras ravioli and the (beef) short rib agnolotti ($26).  The short rib agnolotti was absolutely fantastic.  The duck and foie gras ravioli (which is what I had before) was ok, but there's not much foie flavor and this time the sauce had a spicy kick to it that I did not care for.  Though the waiter warned us that the pasta portions were light (in between appetizer and entree size, he said), I actually found them quite filling. I think we got about 12 raviolis, which is a very decent portion.

The restaurant has a lovely view of the strip + Bellagio fountains.  Try to get a table near the window."}
{"text":"Great service, good food.  Our waiter Luis did an excellent job of keeping our drinks fresh.  Great venue for a reception dinner"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dinner with girlfriends here.  We enjoyed the tasting menu that was full of extra bonuses from the chef.  Everything was so tasty and well presented.  The waitstaff were knowledgable and helpful.  My favorite was the simple spaghetti course that was so flavorful and left me searching for the recipe online after dinner."}
{"text":"It's good food, no doubt about that. But browse the menu before dining so you're not surprised by some of the prices. Variety of complimentary breads and butters/jams/oils. Pasta is made fresh, so be patient for your meal. I was disappointed at first with them only having one vegetarian option (spaghetti) but it was great so I'm glad it worked out. I'm sure if I told them my food choice concern, they would have offered to make substitutions but I just didn't want to go through the drama that night."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, had a table overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  Service was top notch as is with most higher end restaurants in LV

Duck & foie gras ravioli - very good 
Polenta with mushrooms - really exceptional.  Smooth and real depth of flavours in the sauce.
Spaghetti - just so much depth and flaour in such a simple dish of pasta, tomato & basil.
Lamb - well prepared, 

Wine Selection - great selection $100+"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday at 6.  Totally dead which is sad because the food and service were so good.  Maybe it picked up after I left?

The bread was excellent and I usually don't like bread at Italian restaurants.  They had a focaccia, ciabiata, standard loaf, and crazy one with meat in it.  As a vegetarian I had the first 3.  In addition there were 3 dips - an amazing butter, a eggplant option, and citrus infused EVOO.

I began with the white artichoke soup.  Great presentation.  Mushrooms and croutons with a nice foam and greens, then came the creamy artichoke soup.  Cleaned the bowl.

Then the famed spaghetti.  The $24 spaghetti that apparently is amazing.  I had to find out for myself.  I hadn't ordered spaghetti from an Italian restaurant in a decade (in high school I'd order it on dates to save money).  It was honestly - ok.  I found mine to be too al dente, but perhaps this is personal taste and preference.  Still good pasta - but don't feel like you have to get the spaghetti.

The service was great.  The waiter was quick, knowledgable, and professional.  The manager came over and chatted with me for 15 minutes which was great.

They sat me at the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains - can't complain about that.

Go here.  So you can say you ate at Scott's place and because it's delicious."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife for a getaway from LA.

Food 5/5
Ambiance 5/5
Service 5/5

My friends and family thought its weird that I like this particular restaurant so much, but I really do!

There is nothing like overlooking the fountains of Bellagio and having a romantic meal with the woman I love. Made me feel like a millionaire (although I'm not ... yet).

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best food I had in a long time. I did not know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious, very refined, well balanced, and the service was outstanding. I had the creme of polenta, the brazzino and the caramel with chocolate mousse. These were outstanding, very well prepared, well balanced, not to much of one or another flavor. The service was great well attentioned. The reception as usual need major upgrade. She made us wait although we had a reservation and the place was not busy, and looked at us with an attitude when I asked how much longer we will have to wait. But beside that it is an outstanding food for the price. Ii can definitely compete with the well known 3 stars restaurants of las Vegas. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Food and ambiance was perfect! The service was immaculate. We had 5 people taking care of us. About the food- it was absolutely delicious! I tried salmon, which was perfectly seasoned and moist, mushrooms- perfect choice of variety in yummy sauce, and the plate of octopus, which was my favourite! Definitely recommend it if you are a foodie and want to spend a romantic dinner with someone special or your friends."}
{"text":"I loved loved loved Scarpetta back in NYC. Their bread basket is second to none. Their truffle mushroom polenta I still dream of til this day. Their panna cotta taught me what the gold standard should be. Imagine the excitement I had in bringing my in laws to the Vegas location. 

Our dining experience certainly did not disappoint. It was definitely all of my family's fav on this trip! 

Short rib agnolotti, spaghetti and meatballs, uni black tagliolini, duck and foie gras ravioli, and Branzino - every dish was beyond delicious! Our table couldn't get enough. 

My personal fav is still and will always be their mushroom and polenta. I don't understand why they don't just offer a full entree portion! I can eat a whole bucket worth - so so so so good. 

Desserts - I had three baskets worth of Stromboli swimming in my stomach by this point (along with their polenta and whole plate of duck, foie gras ravioli) but I just couldn't refuse their dessert menu. Coconut soufflé (so airy!), cheesecake (decadent!), donuts (bursting with heavenly Nutella and banana cream), and chocolate cake (brownie like exterior - very rich and perfect for all chocolate lovers) - no options can go wrong. 

Overall - all around 5 stars! Foods, services, ambiance! Would be back every time we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Very nice Italian restaurant. 

The reception at this restaurant was warm and friendly. Our waitress was prompt and helped us pick out stuff from the menu. 

The ambience was nice. The food was fantastic. Best lasagne was probably the best I've ever eaten. Everything else we ordered was great too. It seemed to be real Italian food cooked by Italian chefs. 

I will be going back to this restaurant during my short stay in Calgary."}
{"text":"Authentically Italian food with a modern twist in an understated, elegant and comfortable dining room. The restaurant was happening on a Saturday night but there's enough space between tables that we still had a feeling of intimacy. Everything was perfectly cooked in perfect combinations of ingredients. We had two starters: braised short ribs and brussel sprouts. We shared a pasta chocked full of lots of different vegetables. It had a very earthy flavor and flavors only achieved from patiently creating a reduction. The two entrees of lamb and black cod again featured flavors from painstaking attention and time in the kitchen. Our waiter, although busy, was attentive, friendly and professional. Very nice meal and I love being a little overstuffed(that's why no dessert)."}
{"text":"After reading all of the great reviews, I am really excited to go to this restaurant.  We made a reservation because, online it said that they were recommended, but there were not many people in the place. We got the suggested appetizer of the Tuna Susci and it was delicious! The waiter even had the kitchen split it onto two plates so my boyfriend and I could share.  It was delicious with white truffles in the middle and very well seasoned. My boyfriend ordered the black squid pasta with seafood because the reviews raved about it--it really wasn't that great.  It actually smelled and tasted a little overly fishy, but he was a good sport and ate it all.  I order the duck breast, and the duck was cooked perfectly.  The only suggestion I have is that the duck was cut VERY thick and there was not enough of the delicious orange glaze.  It was good, but not over the top amazing.  We were pretty full but ordered the strawberry shortcake for dessert---OMG AMAZING!  It definitely made up for the mediocre dinner. The service was really great, the dinner was blah, and the dessert was really good.  I would recommend this place, BUT I would not come here again.  There are too many other great restaurants in Las Vegas, this definitely has the atmosphere but I do not think our dinner was worth 150$."}
{"text":"One of the best in terms of quality and service.  Excellent food and awesome wine list."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar- waiter recommended the octopus salad off the regular menu as a light option. It was tasty- had beans similar to fava and a tasty hummus like paste under the octopus, which was likely pan seared. There were also some half sliced baby tomatoes and Brussels sprouts which were seasoned well. It was also happy hour, so I ordered the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti- it was completely delicious!!! It's very rich, close to being a little over oiled, but tastes amazing! They highly recommended the duck ravioli also, said its better but a little heavier. Will definitely order next time. The portion is half what the full dinner portion is, and I found it perfect. Most people could order 2 items off happy hour, which are $7 a piece, and feel satisfied as a meal- order 3 if you're really hungry. They had some cool specialty cocktails on HH all for $7 also, with two beers and their choice of a red and white wine. The best happy hour I've seen at Cosmo! Atmosphere is quaint and romantic. Excited to go back to try more options!"}
{"text":"We tried this place because we watch the Chopped on Food network all the time and wanted to try chef Scott's food. 
I think I definitely have had better fine dines than my experience here. Very beautiful and intimate place as being a luxury in LV is kinda basics. Anyways, we tried their pasta dish with short rib, which the short rib was missing on that plate. I don't know where it was incorporated. If I was a chopped judge I would have taken points off for not really tasting this main ingredient in that dish. The horseradish was definitely the main kick in that dish. We also tried the Bronzini fish dish which was pretty good and made to perfection. We tried our friends dish who got the foi gras ravioli and that was the highlight of the table. For desert we got the little round donuts which were pretty good. I have to mention that the bread service was definitely one of a kind with some bread baked with some kinda salami."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!   Customized everything we requested, very friendly staff, and the vegetarian options were incredible.  I had the creamy polenta as a dinner option and was blown away.  David had the fois gras duck ravioli and was so happy!  Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Great food, Scarpetta manages to offer a level of refinement above its peers in every dish starting from the bread.  I just had oxtail agnolotti from Faith & Flower in LA, Scarpetta's short rib agnolotti blows it out of the water.  Cannot believe there is such discrepency in same star rating, of course everyone has their taste.  Service is sufficient, but I am here to eat, not to be pampered."}
{"text":"we weren't looking for a very high end place to dine... just something average so i guess this place is OK? i still had higher hope then what i actually get... but the $$$ is reasonable so i have no complain.

we tried the duck and foie gras ravioli that everyone is talking about... it's OK... also the black cod... which was OK too... the bread was pretty good w/ the three different kinds of dips they have... desert was what i liked the most... the napoleon and panna cotta were both amazing... 

service was NOT good at all though. our waiter wasn't attentive at all and many times that we had to wave him to order, get more water, or even asked for bread.  and no, the restaurant wasn't busy!

oh well, at least i tried."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Scarpetta in New York and Miami many times and it was simply fantastic. They let us down this time. Pasta wasn't cooked very well. The short rib agnolotti that we had in NYC might have been the best thing we have ever eaten. Here it was just ok. Filling was coming out of pasta and it was very chewy. Hopefully they get it fixed."}
{"text":"Scarpetta finally contacted me and invited us back. There was confusion, my email was forwarded to the wrong person. We don't live in the area so the next time we were in town we made a reservation to return. Mark the manager apologized profusely when we arrived, he also checked on us several times. Our waiter was Roberto, he was flawless. It was night and day with the waiters. Our first waiter really left a bad taste. Roberto not only explained different foods and made recommendations but, gently encouraged us after we made our choice to a different item. He was right. He couldn't have been more spot on. He was very attentive. Ivan was his assistant and was very attentive as well. The food was a beautiful experience. We had the polenta, a must have, carpaccio, melt in your mouth. My husband originally wanted the rack of lamb, but Roberto encouraged him to try the lamb ragu instead. The pasta was freshly made and he thoroughly enjoyed it. I had a steak filet. After wanting another cut, Roberto encouraged me to try the filet. Spot on. I love Gallagher's, but, this was better. Don't tell anybody. The desserts were fabulous, the cheesecake was so yummy. Why not 5 stars? Because of the previous experience. Next time we come we will book with Roberto, he made the difference. If you make a reservation ask for Roberto for an epic meal."}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm giving it two stars is because the server or busser who ever was refilling my drink actually did what he was supposed to. 
For an expensive, high class dinner.. we expected for them to at least make my cousin's husband birthday to be specially. Yaknow, the whole dessert with candle thing. We ordered so many dessert for crying out loud, they didn't really need to give us a free one. At least a candle ? THAT'S STRIKE ONE. 
The second one is.. I got the duck liver pasta.. I expected to get checked on while eating dinner. Yeah, there were a lot of us.. but we also had TWO SERVERS!!! Didn't get asked at any point what so ever how I liked my food (it had no flavor by the way) so I had no choice, because of my hunger, but to bare that food rather than ask for a different one because there was no one to request it from. THAT'S STRIKE TWO
Then the server, didn't tell us the last minute that they could only split checks in the beginning until we needed our checks in the end. In the freaking end!! THAT'S STRIKE THREE 

OVERALL, mediocre food, service was okay, for an expensive price. You're pretty much paying for the name and location of they restaurant.. i suggest skip it and go to a neighboring restaurant instead.

Idk.. maybe it's different for everyone :( but I'm just not a big fan :( I'm a foodie. I love food adventure and food full of flavor. & I just didn't get that.. on the up side, Nutella dessert was great but nothing special"}
{"text":"Favorite spot in Vegas so far. The quality of food & service is great for the price. We ordered the lobster pasta, scallops, brussels sprouts and tuna crudo. We liked everything with the lobster pasta being the best dish. My mom and I had an awesome experience there for Christmas Eve dinner. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Wonderful presentation and food!! If you want great service ask to be seated in jonathan's tables and tip appropriately for the service. Fine dining for foodies for sure."}
{"text":"I went all out Vegas and ended up with a bill that ran me over $90 for just myself. But the black truffle fettuccine and orange soufflé were worth it. The bread basket was the perfect way to kick off Starch Madness and our table ran out of the butter halfway through.
My entree was, for $75, definitely worth every penny. Shaved black truffle on top of truffle infused pasta? And so much parmesan. Everyone was sticking their forks in my bowl! For dessert, we got the orange soufflé which was beyond decadent. I normally can't stand figs but the gelato was surprisingly incredible. Sinking my fork into the ramekin while the Bellagio fountain show went on in front of us was pure bliss.
This is pure Vegas extravagance and I am all for it."}
{"text":"Had a late dinner on 12/3 (10pm).  We were greeted and seated right away.  The restaurant is tucked away, but had a great view of the Bellagio fountain show.  Service was great.  Their wine is is fair.  They had a couple of choices for 1/2 bottle pinot noir at a decent price.
Oysters- The kumamotos (sp?) were pretty good.  They came with a vinaigrette added already
Creamy Polenta- Very good.  
Short ribs Agnolotti- The best dish of the night.  Loved the hint of horseradish amid the butter sauce
Spagetti-  A tad on the bland side.  But liked the home made pasta.
Creme Brûlée-    Not your typical creme brulee.  This was a deconstructed version and was \"interesting\".  Probably wouldn't get it again.  

All in all, a good meal."}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant with a nice menu and ok service BUT if you expect a great restaurant, you will be disappointed.  The prices are high for the quality of the food and the wine prices are exceptionally high.  In fairness, I have been generally disappointed with the restaurants in LV.  Getting close to NYC prices but unfortunately not close enough to NYC quality."}
{"text":"Yes, their food is delicious...but I'm here to tell you about their service.  OMG!  They were awesome!  Came here for Father's Day dinner and everything was on point.  They were so awesome and my parents loved the presentation for all the dishes.  They brought all the entrees each covered by a cloche.  Then they did one of those tata deals, we found that so fun...it's the little things that make an experience grand.   They figured that out, thank you!"}
{"text":"Even though I live in NYC, I've never dined at Scarpetta in NYC.  Very much enjoyed Scarpetta in Las Vegas in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  Service was very friendly and attentive.  I was dining solo, and was seated at the best table in the restaurant with a perfect view of the Bellagio Fountains that are splendid.  The stromboli in the bread basket is delicious!  Loved the duck and foie gras ravioli with marsala.  Very generous portion.  The main course of duck with endive was very good (very soft), but I've had better duck dishes (Le Cirque and Robuchon in LV).  The zeppoles were a bit overdone (too dark) and there was too much nutella filling."}
{"text":"Dined here a week ago with one of my friends and enjoyed the meal.

We each decided to order a couple of courses.  I went with the yellowtail app and 2 pastas, my friend went with the yellowtail, a pasta, and the duck.  We both thoroughly enjoyed the yellowtail.  For the pastas I had the black tagliolini and the duck & foie gras ravioli.  Both were excellent, although the foie ravioli was a little too rich for how much they gave you.  My friend liked the spaghetti but he did say it was a bit over sauced for his likings.  He did rave about the duck.

Overall I would come back.  The pastas all looked great and would do something similar of trying a couple of them."}
{"text":"Dear God. Perfection. Not a misstep in a two-hour dinner. 

Bread basket.
Polenta.
Mushrooms.
Pini (I think that's what it was called? Crazy pasta with lobster and chili pesto)
Cod.

The service was smooth and personable without being phony. The view of Bellagio was phenomenal. Scott Conant, you are my hero."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! One of my all time favorite dinners and I go out to eat a lot. The portions are on the smaller side but hey when you're in Vegas you don't need a big stuffing meal, need to save some room for drinks :)

We ordered the short rib appetizers' with polenta (VERY small portion). They were beyond anything else I've tried. Everything just melted in my mouth. For dinner I ordered the mushroom raviolis I think it was called foie gras ravioli. Again this plate was just outstanding nothing like anything I've ever had before. The grated cheese literally foamed on the plate. I can't stop talking about this meal and recommending this restaurant to others. 

Another plus was the window seating which had beautiful views of the Vegas strip. The place is dimly lit so adds a romantic feel."}
{"text":"Excellent service doesn't describe how great the serving staff and Owner was. Top marks for the staff knowledge of how the food was prepared.  The food was the best New York Italian food, and the best dining in Las Vegas. The deserts were exploding with flavor. A must eat place. - Doug Morneau"}
{"text":"After going to DOCG in Las Vegas, we really wanted to try Scarpetta here in Toronto.
It is a part of the richyrich Thomson Hotel, and was lucky to find parking on the street instead of the pricey lots nearby and valet.

Reserved through Open Table.
The service was pretty quick and attentive. It wasnt too busy, it was Saturday of the Labour Day weekend, but steady.

I had the scallops (which were really good!), while my girlfriend had the creamy polenta (which she thought was outstanding).
We both had pastas for dinner, i had the braised short rib and bone marrow agnolotti (which i could eat all night! the cheesey brown butter sauce was great!) and my girlfriend had the cavatelli (which was awesome too! i stole a few bites!)

definitely glad we made it to Scarpetta in Toronto.
is on the list for Vegas!"}
{"text":"After reading all the great yelp reviews we picked this place for my wife's birthday. Here is your ex-elite yelp renegade review.  I hope it is good enough for you.

Our waiter helped with the wine list and led us in the right direction.  Huge win, you shouldn't have to study beforehand to be able to order wine.

The bread is in fact good. But remember when you review a restaurant that knowing the bread is good is not actionable info.  Actually by knowing this I ordered a strong drink knowing the bread could save me, so good tip.

The appetizers we had were rich, interesting that all of them looked rich. Polenta was good.  Crab corn chowder was great because it came as a plate of just crab - where's the chowder? They pour it on right in front of you, that's where. Fun and effective, lots of nice flavors all stood out. The appetizers were big.

So then we tried the spaghetti because of the yelp reviews. It's tomato basil sauce on spaghetti. Everyone who raves about it is questionable. Have you ever had spaghetti with tomato basil sauce before? It is like that but over twenty dollars. Ours was super salty which I didn't like. This dish would be chopped for sure.

We had two fish dishes both were pretty good but the fennel black cod was the best, cooked just through.

Dessert was 5 huge doughnut balls and really surprised me. Simple and delicious. They were perfectly done. Not a thing wrong. Super satisfying. Service had ramped back up for dessert.

The setting is sweet. Windows overlooking the bellagio fountains. Cool looking wine cellar. Plan your visit to be there through sunset as the strip lights come on.  It had a comfortable relaxed atmosphere but still classy.  We had a lot of fun.  I'd go again."}
{"text":"I come every single Vegas trip. Betty, the head pastry chef is INCREDIBLE. not only does she make the meanest desserts of all time, she is also incredibly generous. The entire staff there is! They sure know how to make you feel pampered. All the other appetizer, pasta, and meat dishes were on point and phenomenal. 

That spaghetti... And Betty..... Keep me coming back for more....!!!! Lol. Till next time!"}
{"text":"We've walked by so many times and wanted to try this place out because of Chef Conant. In fact, last year, I asked my parents-in-law if they wanted to have dinner here but after looking at the prices, they decided against it, so we didn't.

A few weeks ago, I went back to Vegas with my husband so we decided to check this place out, finally. We didn't have reservations so we weren't sure what was going to happen, but we got a corner seat for two. There's a dining room with views of the water show that we can kind of see from our seats. 

My husband wasn't that hungry because we made the mistake of eating at a buffet earlier, so we didn't get an appetizer. I did get some red wine and so didn't my husband. They served us bread to start and it wasn't just any bread bowl, it was freshly baked bread and they were all delicious! I could have just eaten the bread and be happy about it. 

So we finally ordered and I got the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti, it was topped with panko bread crumbs for a nice change of texture. I loved it. It was also very filling! I was really uncomfortable afterwards because of the buffet earlier. My husband got the gnocchis with foam, it didn't have flavor to the foam, just for presentation, I guess. 

We didn't have room for dessert, but we'll come back and have it some time soon. It lost a star because we were seated in the corner there because we didn't have reservations, or so we were told. People who walked in and said they didn't have reservations were able to be seated in the dining room. Please be consistent about it. You can tell us \"the dining room is currently full, you can wait for it to open up or we can seat you now in the corner, which would you prefer?\" Instead, they just made the assumption and seated us. Took away from the experience a bit, I'll be honest.

I posted the photos on my instagram and Chef Scott Conant liked it!!! Then I posted a photo of him liking my photo and he LIKED THAT! yay!!! Very cool! He seems like a cool guy and to top it off, a really great restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved my experience at Scarpettas- Make sure to make a reservation! It can be a bit crowded since there are not too many tables. We ordered the foie gras and duck raviolis. It's amazing how light the raviolis are- my only regret was not ordering more pasta! I thought ordering the spaghetti as an entree would be \"too much pasta\" at Scarpetta's there is no such thing. My boyfriend got the fillet which was of course delicious while I got the New York steak- it's massive! No side needed especially if you order an appetizer. The Primi Piatti are also large enough to serve as a main entree. Asked server her recommendation for the dessert she discussed what the most popular were and which her favorite was... the Bomboloni. Basically, donut holes infused with nutella or vanilla served with a banana gelato. DELICIOUS. The added bonus is definitely the view of the strip and the Bellagio fountaints. Cannot wait to go back! 

Thank you Scarpetta for the amazing service and delicious food! Scott Conant- nicely done."}
{"text":"There is a Scarpetta in NYC but as of last week I have only been to the Las Vegas location. Marc Maron interviewed Scott Conent (who I have seen on TV a number of times) and talked about the spaghetti dish and how he could not believe how good it was. Well it is VERY good. My mom hadn't been feeling great prior to our trip so I think  she didn't really absorb how good the meal was. I had a special appetizer that had Octopus and lentils which was really good. We had a table near the window and were able to see the Bellagio Fountains. Mom had scallops-she said they were good. The spaghetti was really out of this world. Every time one has fresh pasta I think you are reminded that no matter how skilled a cook someone is if it is dry in a box-it is dry in a box. This clearly had been made day of and the tomato sauce, was flavorful and the pasta wasn't drowning in it.

We had the ricotta cheesecake which was a small round serving (different than other places) with some fruit sauce."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to dine here for years and finally got the opportunity this time around even though there's one here in Beverly Hills.  This location is a bit tricky to locate as it is tucked in a corner near Jose Andreas' place and next to D.O.C.G Enoteca.  The atmosphere is romantically dark and narrow but once past the bar, the floor to ceiling glass provides a spectacular view of the Bellagio Fountains.  If you are on a date, request to be seated next to the windows as all tables against the glass are two tops.

Service and Food were outstanding.  Although the spaghetti seemed to be the rave on Yelp and on tv, I thought it was good but not the best I've had.  My personal favorite was the truffle mushroom polenta!!  Highly recommend this dish.  The Apple glazed pork chop is also worth mentioning and it was slightly better than Wolfgang Puck's.  The roast chicken gets high marks especially the sauce that accompanied (chicken liver, onion and shallots)!  We ended the meal on desserts of Nutella & Vanilla custard filled bombolinis and the coconut soufflé.  Nothing was left on our plates.  It was the best meal during our Vegas weekend."}
{"text":"Great views of the Bellagio fountains - and very good food.   We came here once before - and enjoyed our experience then too.

The spaghetti is excellent (I got that last time too).  I add on the meatballs this time, and wasn't really impressed (so sorry - but they reminded me of the meatballs that come in spaghettio cans....sorry).    

Wine selection was good, but pricey.   Would recommend this place for a splurge!   View and atmosphere is worth it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I chose this restaurant as our splurge meal for the weekened becuase of the reviews it had online. The ambiance is quiet and romantic and most tables have a view of the Bellagio fountains. The bread has cheese and peperoni in it, like a litte stromboli. The grapefruit gimlet was good, not the best drink I had on this trip but dinner was amazing. I asked my waiter which of three pastas he reccomended and I was suprised when he reccomened the least expensive one. It was the ricotta and truffle pasta. It was very simple but everything worked perfectly together. Best passta dish I have ever had. My boyfriend the lamb loin which was perfectly cooked. We shared the panna cotta. I belive it was coconut and passion fruit. I would definitely reccomend the panna cotta and the pasta. The wait staff was friendly and just the right amount of attentive. Definitely my favorite restaurant at the cosmo!"}
{"text":"Everything was squisito! Exquisite!! Scarpetta is doing Italian right. The atmosphere, food and service were all impeccable. 

LOCATION: It's located at The Cosmopolitan (where all the great restaurants seem to be). 

ATMOSPHERE: The ambiance is romantic, lighting was dim and sexy, view of the bellagio fountains were breathtaking. Upscale and Trendy. Great for celebrations or a date night. 

DRINKS & FOOD: We started with a bottle of champagne for the table while we enjoyed the variety of complimentary breads (the bacon and cheese was my fave). We were a group of 4, and shared all plates. For an appetizer we ordered the tuna crudo and yellowtail crudo. They plated it for us and the presentation was beautiful. The fish was melt in your mouth delicious and seasoned perfectly with just enough kick to wake up your taste buds. We ordered 2 plates of the spaghetti, split into 4 portions, the short rib/bone marrow agnolotti and the pici. All pasta dishes were cooked perfectly al dente. Accompanied by a bottle of Justin's Isosceles, which never disappoints. The spaghetti was simple but delicious - spaghetti noodles with tomato and basil. The short rib agnolotti is a mixture of short rib and bone marrow inside a flat agnolotti noodle (think mini cylinder raviolis). It's rich and savory. The pici pasta with lobster, tarragon, almond and chili pesto was by far everyone's favorite. It's a must order. We finished the night with some Nocello, an Italian black walnut liqueur. I'm not into dessert drinks but I will definitely be buying a bottle of this for home. 

SERVICE: Service was outstanding. Our waiter made some great recommendations, our drinks were always full. And Noah, the sommelier? was very warm, welcoming and fun. He really made our night special. 

Value: I'd say this is more of a 4-$$$$ restaurant, but well worth the $140 per person."}
{"text":"Gorgeous restaurant, great service, beautiful food...and be prepared to shell out some cash! 

During our Vegas trip, hubs and I were looking for some great Italian and being that we were staying next door in Aria, we figured Scarpetta at the Cosmopolitan would be a great fit. A 9:30 pm reservation and we were off!

As mentioned, this is a pretty romantico restaurant with dim lighting, slick tables and modern touches. Service was helpful but not intrusive - a definite plus! 

And how about the dishes...

Heirloom tomato salad: 4/5: A very delicious combination of incredibly fresh stracciatella cheese, great tomatoes a bit of salsa verde and eggplant. The portion was small but it was bursting with flavor.

Spaghetti: 4/5: Yeah, seems boring but our server mentioned how great the fresh pasta, scratch made sauce and basil was, so I went for it. I'm glad I did because the pasta was perfectly al dente and the flavors were completely on point without being overwhelmingly tomato-y. Again, portions are very small here - even for the pasta. Perhaps a 1-1.5 cups of pasta for $24...that's pretty steep...albeit delicious. 

Would I go back to Scarpetta? Absolutely. It's creative and delicious Italian fare in a gorgeous restaurant. Give it a try...and bring your credit card :)"}
{"text":"Was here with a large group (bachelorette party) and we got the tasting menu with wine pairing.

Excellent food in general. Favorites were short rib agnolotti, scallops, and yellowtail, as well as the duck (though it was at the end and we were so full already we hardly ate any)
 Was underwhelmed only by the spaghetti dish (why am I filling up on something I could have cooked at home?). The rest of the dishes were superb, down to the port and lava cake-esque dessert."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. The first thing to come out was their complimentary bread, which featured a few different varieties along with Marscapone butter, eggplant, and citrus infused olive oil.  I ordered the Black Tagliolini with Dungeness crab and masago, which was very flavorful, but the real kicker was the texture and quality of the pasta.  Perfectly Cooked.

I also ordered the espresso old fashioned to drink which was very good.  Definitely a great meal in vegas, and the view is pretty special too."}
{"text":"You know when you watch those shows like \"Best thing I ever ate\" or \"Enter cities name-Best\" and you see the food on the show.. get all hyped for the food.. and its a major let down?!... Well this is not one of those places!!! This is a life changing experience in all things Italian..i.e. Pasta!!! 

Entering this restaurant your first impressions are, this place is fancy and nice.. beautiful layout.. ask for a window seat to look over the Las Vegas Strip.

My Wife and I when seated, were greeted with a delicious assortment of breads and focaccia to die for. 

We started our meal with the polenta with mushrooms and truffles it was creamy and decadent! 8/10 delicious! 

Next for our main dishes-

I ordered the fabled $25 dollar simple basic Tomato basil pasta dish... it arrived in a decanter and unveiled in front of you.. it is molded into a tight little ball and then unravels into a full dish.. I take my first bite and Wowwwwwwww!!!!!! Mind blowing!! Delicious is to weak of a word for this pasta!! Im italian and this is multiple levels in flavor ubove anything i have experience with such simple ingredients!! It is creamy almost like a vodka sauce.. but after watching how its made.. its the blending of butter and parmigiana cheese i would pay twice the price for this dish! 10000/10

My Wife ordered the ravioli with duck and foie gras with a balsamic drizzle... also fantastic!! 

This is one of the best food experiences I ever had and I have traveled the world tasting food!! Bravo Scarpetta!!"}
{"text":"Another excellent choice at The Cosmopolitan in Vegas. We sampled several pastas and appetizers. The short rib agnolotti, pesto penne and the ravioli a were all great choices. The Halibut and Petit Filet of beef were the best entrees. The chocolate cake with almond ice cream was the most popular dessert."}
{"text":"I loved this place. It has a very sleek and modern feel.  If you can sit by the window with a  view of the Bellagio fountains, it's an added bonus.  The market salad was amazing and unlike anything I've ever had before. The house made tomato, basil and mozzarella past was also amazing.  Honestly, the real star may have actually been the bread basket though. There were four kinds, and they were all delicious.  We also had the veal, but compared to the other things we ordered, it was the least exciting part of the meal."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for meetings and two of my foodie coworkers and I had planned on visiting Scarpetta.  Unfortunately, my original dinner companions were feeling under the weather but by sheer coincidence, my brother and his girlfriend happened to be in town.  They gladly joined me.

I really like Scott Conant's no-nonsense style on the Food Network and of course knew of his NYC restaurant's stellar reputation.  I was looking forward to this.

When we got to the Thompson Hotel, where the restaurant is located, we were impressed by how beautiful the space is, very open and inviting.  We sat and ordered a drink.

Even though I did look at the starter menu, I knew I was going to have the polenta; I had heard so much about it!  For the mains, both my brother and I were indecisive so we asked the waiter what his favorite was.  He very confidently told us that as incredibly simple as it sounds, the spaghetti with tomato and basil had made Conant's reputation.  I then asked about the branzino and he said that it was a great choice too.  When he saw we still couldn't make up our mind, he suggested we share both dishes and we immediately agreed.

The polenta came and it was so incredibly creamy and delicious that it didn't really need the mushroom reduction, however good it was.  It was sensational.  I am still craving it a few months later.

When the mains arrived, we were expecting to see two plates that we would have to try to split evenly.  But no!  The chef had actually created 2 plates for each dish so that we could enjoy the dishes the way they were meant to be.  Very nice touch!

The branzino was expertly cooked and impeccably fresh.  The delicate flavors of the sides were a perfect accompaniment.  The spaghetti however was the star.  It was perfect.  There is no other word.  The few ingredients all shined through and made this very simple dish something almost otherworldly.  The third dish, ordered by my brother's girlfriend, was the duck and foie gras ravioli and she enjoyed it immensely.

She then ordered the coconut panna cotta, which is served in a guava \"soup\".  I consider myself something of a minor authority in panna cotta as it is my favorite dessert to make and the texture of this one was exquisite.  The guava and coconut flavors were delicate and went together very well.

What a meal this was.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a great classic Italian. The fresh bread that they serve is awesome! Assorted flavors baked in and all addicting. I had the lardons to start. Good if a little charred. I went with the classic spaghetti and meatballs. Good simple but fresh flavors. Also tried some of the different raviolis which were all good. Definitely on the pricy side but excellent view and staff to go along with the food."}
{"text":"It was good!
Went with 4 girlfriends last night, and all were pleased.
The ambiance was nice and the service was GREAT! It was really what set the experience apart from lesser fine-dining options, as opposed to the food.

The duck/foie gras ravioli was definitely the star at our table.
Two people ordered the spaghetti, which I tried. It was definitely tasty, but not hype-worthy. 
Other dishes hit the table- the scallop and short rib appetizers are small, and the short rib wasn't amazing. I didn't try a scallop.
I had the Jidori chicken (because I never order chicken and saw another review that insisted). Very good!

Recommended generally."}
{"text":"No words can describe how happy this experience made me. 

I was in Vegas for a slightly belated celebration of my birthday, and a timely celebration of my friend's. Scarpetta fell on the night we celebrated my birthday, and I am so glad! 

The restaurant looks great and the service is perfect. The waiters are all extremely knowledgeable and can answer pretty much anything. 

But who cares about that? The food... it was ridiculous! To begin with they bring out some bread, as with most restaurants, but Scarpetta bread is next level! There were some regular rolls which were bomb. But there was this one type, no clue what it was called...but it had some kind of meat inside! I thought the waiter mentioned that to us, but I figured I was hallucinating. Nope! It was phenomenal. The bread also came with butter and other accoutrement. All delicious!

So I could have left happy at this point. But my food slayed me. I think I may have actually died, said what up to a couple of angels, and then rejoined my table after frolicking on a cloud or two. I ordered the Black Fettuccine (pasta dyed with squid ink, adorned with king crab, squid, shrimp, and breadcrumbs while bathing in lobster broth). Need I say more? It tasted better than it sounds. It was more than worth the $42 it cost. 

I also tried my friends' flank steak (amazing) and black cod (also amazing). But lets be real...I won.

As a dessert we shared:

Bombolone - Basically an italian doughnut. There were five. Two filled with nutella and three filled with something white that by some ungodly magic was BETTER than nutella! Never thought I'd say that. It also came with banana gelato which just pushed my taste buds past their limits of joy.

Amadei Chocolate Cake: The richest most delicious chocolate cake you'll ever have. The inside was filled with molten chocolate goodness. It also came with toasted almond gelato. Also heavenly.

I implore you to try this restaurant when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food wise over all, the executive chef clearly has an eye for rich flavours that spoil ---- but just gets a little carried away. Ambiance wise overall, you get an upscale New York feel, with 20% awkward service. 

There are pros and cons to Scarpetta - but overall a solid 3 star. 



The space is nice. It's just the right amount of trendy ambiance to be a great lunch spot or for a business meeting after hours. 
The service is good - my personal experience was a little awkward, but i can see the staff have solid training, management is seen, and it's obvious they have good service expectations of the staff in general.

Alternatively, this wouldn't be your top choice if you're looking for some 'warmth'. It's a little more sterile in that sense.

Food is where i was a little disappointed. I had Scallops, Octopus and the short rib Agnolotti. The amount of effort that goes into the appetizers is commendable. For the less than $20 price point, it's actually worth it when you factor in all the components.....but that's the problem. There are so many different components to the appetizers that it becomes really confused ---- and often rather salty. In terms of the pasta, if you're going to be a solid Italian restaurant, you need to get that right - sadly my experience showed technical flaws and inconsistencies."}
{"text":"After a long day of competing a bunch of us were SUPER hungry and wanted carbs.  We were in the Inglewood area so one suggested 500 Cucina where authentic Italian food with a twist is served and a reservation for 8 at 6:45pm on Saturday night was made. As we were gathering people, we realized there were more than 8 so when some of us arrived, it wasn't busy and they were kind enough to move us to a table to accommodate all 12 of us.  The table was right in front of the door so it wasn't the best on a cold night.

One of the first things I noticed was the live music which was really nice - and apparently they have live music every Saturday at 7!  We were handed menus and poured waters, and couple of us ordered some drinks so I was able to taste a sip of Pimms and lemonade which was really good and refreshing.   We all had decided what we wanted and the majority of us ordered pizza while some ordered pasta.  Mandy and I shared an order of meatballs and Diavolina pizza, only half with jalapenos. While we waited for our food, we were chatting away and as time went on, we were still chatting away and food was nowhere to be seen - I think we all started to wonder where food was because we were all extremely hungry until finally a part of our tables food came and we were getting excited but then....more food never came out - 4 out of 12 got their food and started eating because of our hangriness while the rest of us observed in jealousy. Our conversation started to become \"I'm sooooooooooo hungryyyyy\".  The 4 who got their food were midway through their meals when a waitress came up to the other end of the table and says that she has bad news \"Okay....so unfortunately there's no food.......... *giggle* no, it will be a few more minutes - somehow the orders got split up in the kitchen\" I think we all had this unimpressed blank stare at her.  Yes, we know she was trying to be funny but don't do that to a group of famished people -_-!!!! Any who, it was much longer than a 'few more' minutes and we were not impressed at all.  The others had finished their food by the time the rest of our meals came out and even bringing the food out, it was a mess - they gave the wrong orders to people but at that point, we were too hungry to care. 

Mandy and I had instant regrets with sharing because we wanted our own pizza by the time it came. Our order of meatballs came with 5, they were a good size and super moist with tomato sauce on top. The pizza was good, the diavolina came with tomato sauce, two types of spicy meats, black olives, jalapeno peppers and mozzarella. The crust was fluffy, soft and a little crunchy - they put whole jalapeno peppers on top so it can get pretty spicy, the salty meat, olives and the mozzarella cheese was a good combination with a kick of spice (I took the jalapenos off).  The pizza was good, we devoured it quite fast though - I didn't get a chance to ask others what they thought because there was a moment of silence when the rest of the food came out - all we wanted to do was eat.

Ohhhhhhhhhhhh 500 Cucina, I really, really, reeeally wanted to like you.  Although the live music was nice, food was decent, the service just didn't meet our expectations.  The food didn't come at the same time and it took way too long to arrive for our famished bodies and to top it off, at the end they had to ask whoever ordered drinks, how many they had because our first waitress's shift must have ended.  I don't think this is the first time this has happened either...

*SIGH* :("}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place and boy am I glad I did. 
fresh food, fresh fish, seafood to die for and I can't believe the prices. You'd expect fine dining prices.... but not true and in Inglewood sooo close. Service was great too they really know their stuff. 
I will be back."}
{"text":"Decent food. The spaghetti was pretty good but I wouldn't consider it a meal. Hubby got the veal which he said was pretty good. Probably not a restaurant we'd visit again."}
{"text":"I was apprehensive to go somewhere so expensive for a friends birthday and honestly the menu didn't thrill me. 

First off the restaurant and service, ambiance the view - excellent. If this food appeals to you and you have the budget I would highly rec for a special occasion. I have to say tho I DO think that it is overpriced for many menu items but its fine dining at the Cosmo so what do you expect. 

As a group we ordered 3 pasta dishes, 1 soup and a desert. I tried the crab and corn soup - delicious as was the chocolate cake I ate. however the show stoppers were the duck and bone marrow pasta dishes - DEVINE. I would go back and order only those and eat them all and not share a bite."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant with a view of the Bellagio fountains and a romantic atmosphere.  

You're given a bread bowl at the beginning of the meal with a nice array of breads with olive oil, butter, and an eggplant dipping sauce. The bread was amazing. 

We started with the black tagliolini, a pasta with squid ink, crab, and fish roe.  It was a unique dish with a delicate flavor.  The roe provided little bursts of sweetness which complimented the crab nicely. 

I had the Branzino, which was perfectly executed.  It was served with a saffron broth poured over it at the table.  Another beautiful dish with delicate flavors.  I do wish that some ellement of it had a bit more \"pop.\"  Overall a very nice meal."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my partner's birthday, recommended by two gourmet friends. I made the reservation through the app Open Table and we got a place close to the window where we could see the Bellagio Water Show. It was awesome!!. We ordered Duck and Foie Ravioli, Creamy Polenta, Tuna Carpaccio and Al Ceppo, the most exquisite flavor,  I couldn't say which was the best!!, also an excellent selection of Wines,  a friendly Staff and a fine atmosphere that made an unforgettable night."}
{"text":"It was amazing!!!  One of the best meals I have ever had.  The service was great and very classy.  The Roasted Scallops were definitely the best Scallops I have ever had.  I also the loved our Pasta and Filet, the dessert was also great.  I had Coconut Panna Cotta with Pineapple and Guava Soup, which is now my favorite dessert!  I would go back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Our second trip to Scarpetta, and I can't deny anymore - I am in love.  How could you not love a restaurant that never says no?  Just get a bite to eat in the bar?  No problem  More bread?  No problem  Split plates, take a look at the dining room, what's in this cocktail, table by the window...all no problem.  The food and cocktails are all executed perfectly.  Next time I'm in maybe I'll pop the question."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Went her for my girlfriend's birthday and was delicious!  I had their Aged Sirloin of Beef Rare as possible for $36 and the Spaghetti Tomatoes with Basil is to die for here.  Service and atmosphere was perfect.

Can't want to go here again. =D"}
{"text":"Emailed in advance and requested a table with a good view of the Bellagio fountains. And they duly obliged. Really good table and view. 

Had the 6-course tasting menu with matching wines. Some amazing food, especially the signature pasta dish with cheeks.

Only negative was the temperature. The air con was set to super cold and it was a bit much at times."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant just to try the Spaghetti with tomatoes & basil as seen on the Food Network.  Unbelievable!  Also, can't forget the braised beef short ribs with polenta & truffled mushrooms.  So many choices in Vegas but this is one to check out.  Wine prices are a bit on the high side."}
{"text":"With hundreds of restaurants lining the strip, choosing one for dinner is no easy task. Scarpetta is one I will recommend over and over again. Everything from the wine to the ambiance to the food was fantastic, absolutely zero complaints from our group of 4. They have a great location in the Cosmopolitan overlooking the Bellagio fountains, request a seat by the windows for a great view. Their pastas are all homemade and delicious and I highly recommend making room for a couple of those if you can, but whatever you choose you really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"scarpetta is located on the 3rd floor of the cosmopolitan hotel.  you can either take the escalator or the elevators up.  if you do take the escalator to the 2nd floor, the escalator to the 3rd floor is around the corner not immediately next to it.  

they have a bar area if you can't get a reservation.  

they dim the lights.  the setting is nice and elegant.  the wine cellar is a whole wall of the restaurant.  we sat next to the wine cellar wall.  if you sit next to the window, you can get a view of the bellagio water fountain. 

the complimentary bread basket was extraordinary.  it consisted of ciabiatta, foccacia, homemade stromboli w/salami + smoked mozarella,  the stromboli was warm and reminded me of pizza. =)  it came with condiments of citrus infused olive oil, eggplant tapenade, and a mascapone butter.  

usually when the wine list is that extensive, we ask the waiter for recommendations.  he asks questions like would you like red or white...light, mildly bold, or bold.  we chose bold...which was the chianti...and sure enough it was very bold in flavor.  it comes in a glass flask.  this is to let the wine breathe before serving.  then they pour the flask into your glass.  they make sure that the wine arrives at the optimal temperature.  

our first appetizer arrived...the braised short ribs comes on a bed of risotto with shavings of parmesan cheese on top.  since they knew we were sharing, they split the portion so that we had our own pretty half of braised short ribs.  if they hadn't done that we may have fought over it.  deep flavors, tender ribs, and perfectly cooked risotto tickled our palates.  we enjoyed it so much that we asked the waiter for another menu to try more appetizers. 

we ordered the tuna scusi (which was recommended by the waiter) and the sea scallops.  the waiter came back to inform us that our entrees were already fired up...if we would want the rest of the appetizer to arrive before the entrees...or if it was okay that the entrees arrived and then to have the newly ordered appetizers..  we told him that whatever was done first was fine.  but that shows that they take enough care in serving their food to notify us.

the sea scallops were equally savory.  it was seared to perfection with several different types of mushrooms.  there was also a sunchoke sauce on the plate that tasted like a deep cream of mushroom sauce (but its different...but the closest flavor that i can think of..).

the tuna scusi was not as impressive, not because it was not a good appetizer.  it was like sushi...vegetables inside with thinly sliced tuna instead of seaweed wrapping the vegetables.  it wasn't bad but it just didn't have the wow factor of the previous two appetizers. 

now on to the entrees...

first we had the duck and foie gras ravioli.  adorable little triangular pillows of ravioli drizzled with a brown sauce.  do not be deceived with the small ravioli, these packed a punch of flavor.  hubby said that this dish worth coming for.  course he also laughed saying that there was a scarpetta location in beverly hills.  pasta bliss!

we also had the spaghetti with tomato and basil.  i read about this spaghetti so i had to try it for myself.  why was this spaghetti better than most spaghetti??  well, my answer came when i took the first bite, the spaghetti tasted like chinese hand pulled noodles!!! 

no one else has said that...but the spaghetti really did taste like chinese hand pulled noodles.  if you are familiar with it, you would know that the noodle is chewy and must be cooked al dente (example: like jia jiang mein).  it's chinese hand pulled noodle with an italian flavoring.  now you know. *wink*

there was no room for dessert.  the waiter commented that we did well since we devoured everything...two bread baskets w/condiments, three appetizers, and two entrees.  each dish had great presentation.  we stared at each plate for a couple seconds since it was \"too pretty to eat\"...before taking the first bite. 

oh, this meal was worth it.  the bill arrived and was less than we expected also.

food -- 5 stars
presentation -- 5 stars
service -- 5 stars"}
{"text":"This would be a 4.5 restaurant in my book.  I would definitely come back or recommend this eatery for anyone who cares about the ambience.  Beautiful restaurant, great views of the Bellagio Fountain, service is on point and the food is above average.  However, next time I would order from the menu, the holiday fixed menu did not meet the expectations."}
{"text":"The spaghetti here is to die for! Perfectly cooked al Dente noodles. Fresh pasta. Made with olive oil infused with herbs, Parmesan, fresh tomatoes. I would come back just to have this spaghetti again. 

I loved the creamy polenta with truffle too!  

I'm going to book mark the other scarpetta location(s) too."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the hype is for. We had the spaghetti and short rib pasta and it was so very below average, I cannot tell you. The sauce on the spaghetti had no flavor and there was hardly any short rib in the agnolotti.  I can't believe this place has so many good reviews.  There are so many other good places to eat in Vegas, this is not it."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to Inglewood with friendly and knowledgeable service. Great arancini, crisp veggie filled insalata mista, and fresh made pasta with delightful sauces and ingredients."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place ... and I loved the way it looked and felt. But between the service that night and the food, I was really disappointed. 
There was 9 of us and we ordered apps to share, and most of them missed the mark. We had : frito misto, octopus, short rib, polenta, and the tuna rolls. The calamari had veggies and a UFO- unidentifiable fried object - polenta posing as calamari. That wasn't cute. The octopus was great, but it was swimming in this bland broth of garbanzos and tomato. Yuk. The polenta was good, if u like cream of wheat for dinner, and the short rib app was just bad. Cold and bland and slimy. 
Then came the mains -- I got the cod. Undercooked friggin cod. I can't have undercooked now. It. Was. Vile. I sent it back.
There was a problem with service that night, and the octopus came after the mains, and our potato and Brussels sprouts never came. As an apology the restaurant comped my dish (and another angelotti that was doing the backstroke in oil) and sent out 6 desserts on the House. 
I added a star because they made an expensive accommodation for their shortcoming tonight, and that def redeemed their service. The waiter was also very apologetic, and service is paramount to me, esp. in a high end restaurant.
I loved the bread basket and the mascarpone butter...so much that it ended up being my dinner...since the food just wasn't good that night. So kudos on the service portion of the meal, but I will not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good for Las Vegas but not exceptional overall for italian food in general."}
{"text":"This is my first ever check-in on Yelp! 
I had a great dining experience at Scarpetta. The food was beyond delicious. The service was terrific and the view was breathtaking. We sat right next to the window so we got to watch the Bellagio water ballet as we munched on our perfectly cooked pasta and veal medallions. 

We ordered the braised short ribs with farro and the tuna rolls as our starters. The tuna rolls were not impressive but the quality of the tuna was great. The braised short ribs with farro was so good I could've eaten bowls and bowls of it. The beef was flavorful and tender and the farro was cooked to perfection. I wish we ordered another plate of the short ribs because I loved it. I ordered the famous spaghetti and it was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. The pasta was so fresh, soft and chewy. It was simple but done perfectly. My friends ordered the tortellini with duck and foie gras, veal medallions and fresh pasta sheets with lobster, garlic and pistachios. Everything was delicious. For dessert, we ordered the napoleon with creme brulee and blood orange sorbet. 

Our server was attentive and not pushy. He also had a great sense of humor.  

It was a great experience over and I would recommend you stop by this place when you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Okay, this was my 3rd time dining here and it gets better everytime.
Firstly 
When in Vegas, I choose to live like a king
I overtip
for the exception of Tacos El Gordo my family and I choose to fine dine
Being a sports better I chose January 10th thru January 15 
NFL divisional Playoffs and of course the college football nation championship game
and all the NBA and college basketball in between.

This trip we decided Scarpetta at the Cosmo, Prime at the Bellagio and Gordon Ramsays Steak at Paris.

we order the coli flour soup without the rabbit for my 6 year old 
2 orders of the scallops with Foie Gras for all of us to share 
Let me say the bread baskets and especially the eggplant dish they bring with it is absolutely amazing.
so back to the scallops and Foie Gras, perfectly cooked and delicious the poached pears went with the Foie Gras better than anything I have ever tasted.

Next our side dishes
fingerling potatoes were magnificent perfectly seasoned and cooked just right
the Brussels sprouts in creamed Pancietta and fuji apples was to die for, How do you make Brussels Sprouts taste so good?

Our main courses
Lobster Pici for my daughter, she mainly picked at the lobster 
I had the Foie Gras Ravioli 
my wife had the newest item called  TAGLIATELLE 
that could have been the best of the best
pork cheeks in a delicious pasta with an alfredo like cream sauce over it.

As I said, we eat at some of the finest restaurants in vegas, and for the 3rd trip in a row, we find ourselves still discussing Scarpetta 
the least expensive of the wonderful places we ate at is the one we cant wait to get back to.
Mr. Scott Conant, You sir are a PASTA GOD
Our Bill at Prime was 420.00 + tip
Our Bill at Gordon Ramsays was 360.00 + tip
Our Bill at Scarpetta 230.00 + tip and this is where we were satisfied more than any other place."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5 Stars
Service: 4.5 Stars 
Atmosphere: 5 Stars 


Scarpetta used to be my favorite Italian restaurant in town, but from my recent visit, it seems like it isn't the case no more. I believe it has a lot to do with Scott Conant is no longer involved with this place. 

We came in as party of nine and was lucky to get a private room/chefs table with the view of kitchen and fountain view. 

The service was decent and fast. I appreciate our server's Mike who provided honest opinions/suggestions. Mike was actually our server a few years back when we had our dinner party here as well. 

As soon as we got our bread basket, I realize the quality isn't there. I used to talk about their bread baskets to my friends since I love bread so much. Loved the variety and the warm and fresh bread. It's not the warm and fresh bread anymore. It's cold and a-okay bread. The eggplant dressing for the bread isn't the same either. The flavor was way off. 

Thankfully, most of the appetizers and entrees that we ordered were still decent. Although my friend felt like there's less lobster in Pici now. The texture of the pasta are still great thankfully.

Another let down was the dessert, I used to love their dessert. The banana soufflé and coconut panna cotta in guava soup were so good. The hotel took over the dessert department. Beside the cheesecake that our server recommended, all other dessert that we got were not impressive. 

Hopefully Scarpetta will improve and get back to the quality that they used to have."}
{"text":"Surprised my boyfriend with dinner here this past Saturday for his birthday. We made reservations for 7:30 and requested a table by the window. We were 5 minutes late because we had to stop by the ATM which, by the way, is located right at the foot of the escalator by security. We were greeted by the hostesses and manager who were all friendly. The dining room itself was a lot smaller than I had expected. They were able to accommodate our request and we were seated at a beautiful 2 top with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains. Water glasses were immediately filled and a bread basket magically appeared with 3 accompaniments: citrus infused olive oil, eggplant spread and my fav, mascarpone cheese... way better than boring butter! Like everyone has already mentioned the bread basket was delish! We also got a bottle of red wine for a great price, $75. We shared everything and for some of the dishes they were actually able to split it in 2 so it would be easier to share! This was my first time tasting fresh pasta and you can most certainly taste a difference. There's a specific bite and texture that can't be compared to that dry stuff at the grocery... 

-Raw Yellow tail: 4 very fresh pieces!!! Love the salt sprinkled on it. And the pieces were actually pretty thick and not some skimpy thin little things.
-Creamy Polenta with truffled mushrooms: Perfect balance of creamy and sweet. I liked it because it was more like a soup for me haha
-Braised Short ribs with Risotto: tender chunks of beef. Tasted like this Korean short rib dish that I love. 
-Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli: My favorite dish of the night. It was so decadent and delicious. If you don't like the taste of strong cheese, you will not like this dish. The sweet Marsala sauce paired perfect with it.
-Spaghetti: I'm sure some people have a problem spending $25 on a small plate of spaghetti but it definitely is something everyone should taste at least once. Light, fresh sauce with perfectly aldente pasta... It is because of this dish alone my boyfriend had been wanting to come to Scarpetta. He has made this recipe a couple times for me and I'm sorry to say but my boyfriend's spaghetti tastes exactly the same.. if not better. But then again my opinion may be biased HAHA
-NY Strip Steak: It was a mistake ordering this because we were so full. We had to force ourselves to finish this dish HAHA At $55 though I didn't think the steak was THAT amazing.. It actually had some unwanted gristle on it. But I'm sure it would have tasted a lot better had we not been SO full. 

I really wanted to get dessert for him and they were going to do something special for us but we were already so late for our show and not to mention so beyond STUFFED.. We had to run out of there... literally, we ran out of there! 

Service was amazing all night from our server all the way down to the lady who came around with parmesan cheese and chili flakes. But special shout-out to Paul K...the friendly food runner/expo who was so polite and quite knowledgeable about all of the food. 

THANKS SCARPETTA! 
SCOTT CONANT, YOU ARE HOT 
;ppp"}
{"text":"It took until the last night, when perhaps I was thinking a little clearer, to realize that not only there was a Scarpetta's in LV, but it was in my own hotel! Scarpetta's is one of my favorites in NYC, and who knew it was SO close to me! My friend and I were looking for a romantic, filling date before our red eye home, and I insisted that we go here!

When walking in, we actually first walked in to the restaurant next door, as the signage is a bit confusing. We finally figured it out and found the right place. When walking in it is dark, romantic, elegant and seduces you with the high class, romantic but somewhat edgy vibe, the aromas are tempting, and the music hits the right parts of your soul. We were immediately drawn to the fancy special occasion room, which was set up to look like a palace, and the incredible timing of the Bellagio fountains was displaying in the background. As we kept saying all vacation, \"What is Vegas?!\" never was more true. We had the option to sit in the formal dining room, or the seats at the bar, and for some reason found the seats at the bar to be more cozy. The dining room had the same elegant, romantic but dark charm to it, while the bar was a little lighter and more lively. However, in the dining room you can get seats that overlook the city and the fountain (not real life).

Now the menu is the same, or mostly similar to the NYC location, so I already knew what to get. The classic pasta with red sauce (what they are famous for)! My friend got the pork belly, and we split the Brussell's. There really is no comparison for their food. Little words exist to describe the perfection of the flavors, aromas, textures, and presentation. All that you need to know, is that this should be a mandatory part of everyone's trip."}
{"text":"Very delicious! They got us a last minute reservation on a Saturday night. The fettuccine with veggies was outstanding. The Pici dish was also very good. The service was great, constantly refilling our waters and giving us more bread. It is very expensive, but worth it for a night out in Vegas."}
{"text":"Simply amazing!  Awesome good, fantastic service and great ambiance!  Can't get any better than this!  Went for Mother's Day/mom's birthday and they did not disappoint!  We were on a time crunch because the restaurant opens at 6pm and we were trying to catch Celine at 7:30.  We made reservations and got there and was promptly seated at 6.  We told our server, Johnny, of our situation and he just rocked it.  We already reviewed the menu before going in but it was Johnny and the staff that really made the magic happen.  Below are some of the dishes we had (sorry, they're not the fancy names but I don't remember them so I'm going to just make them up and you can try to figure it out).  All noodles are made in house and perfectly cooked.  Noodle plates were about $25-35 each.

1.  Black noodles.  ONE OF MY FAVS.  Sooooooo good!!!  They piled the roe on it and it was aaammmaziinng.  It was like having wonderful surprise bursts in every bite.  A MUST.

2.  Green noodles with lobster called PICI.  Another fav!!  Has a spice kick to it.  Not stingy with lobster and huge chunky pieces.  A MUST ORDER.

3.  Spaghetti.  Ok.  We got it because it was recommended by yelp reviewers, but wish we got another noodle dish like the spare rib one.  I would skip this one.  The other dishes are far more creative!

4.  Octopus starter.  Amazing!  So tender and did not feel like I was eating octopus.  Tasted and had the consistency of a more expensive sea animal.  

5.  Applewood smoked pork chop.  PERFECTLY cooked and you can taste the delicious smokiness.  My brother said it was the best pork chop he's eaten.  Soooo good!!

6.  Side of mushrooms.  Delicious!  Great side!

7.  Scallops.  Our eyes rolled to the back of our heads when we tasted this.  Soooo good!!!  And so tender!  

8.  Black cod.  Just melts in your mouth.  

9.  Mandarin soufflé.  So soft and the cream and ice cream with it was so subtle!  Perfect non heavy dessert to finish it off.  They even put a candle on it for my mom's birthday and wrote happy birthday!

10.  Bread basket (comes with meal).  Dude.  This might be the best bread basket I've ever had.  No joke.  Warm and delicious, it was dangerous because we didn't want to fill up on it but we kept eating.

Guys, if you want to impress your date, recommend a reservation at 6 exactly and get there like 5:45 to get a window seat with a view.  The window seats were all 2 table tops and filled up quick.  We got a booth because we were 5 people.  For groups of like 10, I saw a nice private room with a window view.  

Food was amazing, service was impeccable, cannot stress how amazing this place is.  Will definitely come back again to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Absolutely stunning atmosphere.  Thanks to other reviews, I requested a table by the window and I'm so glad I did.  We sat at a beautiful table overlooking the bellagio fountains.  Service was above and beyond.  We enjoyed a bottle of wine and some apps before dinner.  The lemon pasta was wonderful as was the duck.  
Thank you for a very enjoyable evening.  
We would surely come back here."}
{"text":"Great spot!  Food is great! Staff is excellent.  Very close to the Scarpetta in NYC."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars

Came here for our 1 year wedding anniversary, and booked weeks in advance. We were greeted at the door and congratulated by the host, which was very nice. 

We were then escorted to the worst table in the house: a wobbly 4 top table in between 4 large parties of business men, where we couldn't hear each other talk. We were also given nasty looks when we asked for a booth away from the crowd seating. 

The food overall was 4 stars. The spaghetti and lobster picci were cooked al dente and were enjoyable, with perfect portions. The added meatballs were $8 for tiny bits over over cooked, tougher beef- we recommended skipping those. 

Drinks were average price for white table cloth dining, and were made very stiff. No disappointment here. 

Dessert options looked great, and we opted for the bomboloni's after seeing other Yelp reviews. They were just \"ok\". Even fried doughnuts with barely any filling inside, which ended up making us both sick later that evening. 

Overall we give this place 3.5-4 stars. Worth a try if you want fine dining Italian food when in Vegas, but nothing exciting and certainly not a \"must visit\" venue. We tried it, and don't feel the need to return."}
{"text":"So yummy!  Got the burrata,short rib pasta and my husband ordered the huge rib eye special. I could've eaten about 3 of my meals! My hubby called it quits and our waiter told him good effort. Overall a great experience. Wish they had gelato for desserts!"}
{"text":"Wow...... just wow. I can't believe after all these years of coming to Vegas, I missed a place as sexually pretentious yummy as Scarpetta. 

Cosmopolitan Hotel is known as the place to see and be seen, and Scarpetta fits the bill as a place to eat sexy, while looking sexy. Like all key restaurants in the Cosmo, I don't consider anyone of them above a 4-star rating, so giving them 4-stars, means that it's among the best that this hotel offers. 

You absolutely MUST try their tomato basil spaghetti. Cooked to al dente perfection, I was simply amazed that I was able to find anywhere. If you're a foie gras fan, this is one of the few places in town that does it beyond right, including their foie gras ravioli. Their branzino is perfection.

But beyond these dishes, I wasn't overly impressed. Everything else seemed decent, but nothing amazing to the point of worthy mention.

Dessert was excellent though, so you definitely don't want to miss that if you have a sweet tooth. I highly recommend the panna cotta. 

Atmosphere is where I deduct a star. It's a bit too pretentious and dark for me. It's almost like I took a step back in time to a freak-sex club in the 70s. Think Studio 54 that reincarnated as an Italian restaurant, and you've found Scarpetta. It has an annoying level of pretentiousness, so the only way I'd come back is if I return with a group of people."}
{"text":"Came on a Wednesday evening, May 9, 2012.

Catching up on writing reviews, and I wish I could have forgotten about this terrible experience already.

Our party of 4 approached the hostess and politely asked for a table.  She looks up... no smile.  We're told the wait is about 15 minutes, and we reply it's not a problem, asking if it's ok to sit at one of the many empty seats/booths across the bar near the entrance.  She pauses before answering that it's ok (and only later do I sense that her response was a bit cold).

However, I'm still in high spirits from having arrived in Vegas that evening for extended weekend of friends and partying.  As we're led into the dining room, I marvel at the coziness.  The room is quite small, with what seemed like 3 rows of tables, with the window seats overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  It's more intimate than I expected, and I immediately filed the memory as a good place to bring a date.

We're led to a circular, chic booth that had, in hindsight, almost a diner-like feel to it... but it was an upscale setting, and was something I actually enjoyed so we could eat family style.

We had chosen to dine here because Arvin T had heard they had an amazing spaghetti.  But let's continue chronologically.  The bread basket came out, and it was amazing.  The stromboli was tasty, though I'm no expert, and we ended up asking them for a second basket.  The waiter was slow in bringing that second basket out, and I definitely felt like we committed a taboo... but that didn't stop us from reminding him to bring that out for us.

I'd go down a play-by-play for each of the items on the menu, but, to be honest, it wasn't very impressive.  I really hoped the food was so good that I could look past the mediocre service, which bordered on indifferent.  But, alas, it cannot be said.

I would still recommend this place to bring your date for a nice, intimate dinner.  The dim yellow lighting exuded a warmth that I only wished was completed by quality service I had come to expect from the Cosmo...  If service isn't important to you, esp in relation to money spent, then I would still suggest giving this place a go sometime.

However, I think of Vegas as a place to escape - a sanctuary away from the hustles of life.  Scarpetta let me down, and it was only the first punch in the stomach by Cosmo that night."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic dinner at Scarpetta on a Thursday night.  I'd had reservations here on 4 previous occasions and had to cancel for one reason or another every time.  Finally I was getting to try this joint.  We were seated immediately upon arrival.  The restaurant is larger than I was expecting, and if it wasn't full, it was very close.  Lively atmosphere, almost loud, but not quite.  I wouldn't say it would be good for a romantic evening, but it was great for a night out with friends.

Our server immediately approached us and presented us with an impressive wine list.  It may not be the best I've seen on the Strip, but it was well above average.  The prices are typical for a restaurant located in a higher end hotel on the Strip, so you might have some sticker shock.  We went with a barolo which was fantastic.  Service was great throughout the evening, no complaints at all.

In addition to the wine list, we were brought the bread basket.  This has various types of bread, but the one that stood out had bacon and cheese.  It tastes as good as it sounds.  I might try to steal some the next time I eat there to make a sandwich with it the next day, it was great.

To start, our table of 4 split 2 pastas:  the short rib agnolotti and the ricotta cavatelli with wild boar ragu and arugula.  The waiter advised that they were small dishes, so we went with 2 orders of the agnolotti.  Very glad we did, the amount we received was a perfect starter, but splitting the dishes among 4 would have been a stretch.  Both pastas were cooked to a perfect al dente.  Some of the best pasta I've had.  The short rib was very tender and flavorful, and the pasta to filling ratio was great.  Likewise, the wild boar ragu was incredible.  Rich and very deep flavors were seasoned perfectly.  I would be able to just eat a ton of this with a spoon, it was fantastic.  I'd even eat it cold.  

To eat, I went with the special of the evening:  veal osso bucco with risotto.  The veal shank was large and fork tender.  Full disclosure, a buddy of mine ordered this dish as well and his was NOT fork tender.  I saw him use a knife on more than one occasion throughout the meal.  Mine, however, was fantastic.  The meat was moist and melted in your mouth.  It's not the best osso bucco I've had, that honor still goes to the mighty Ferraro's, but it was an A dish for me.  The risotto was cooked well, but had a bit too much citrus for me.  But, I liked the dish enough to keep Scarpetta at 5 stars.

This place isn't cheap, but you can find a LOT higher prices on the Strip and the food you get won't be worth the additional cost.  I had a great deal of anticipation for eating at Scarpetta, and I was not let down.  I've found a new Italian place for my rotation next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"On the food alone, Scarpetta is probably a four star restaurant. But with the spectacular space it occupies (Cosmopolitan Hotel, overlooking the Bellagio fountains), it gets the five star nod from me. 

The perfect ambience is hard to ignore. Unbelievably swanky, Scarpetta just oozes Vegas. Dimly lit, white linens, dark wood and interesting light fixtures mix to create a very upscale atmosphere. 

Food wise, I enjoyed two appetizers: the pea soup and sea scallops. The soup excelled where other dishes didn't in that the pea flavor wasn't showed up by the cream. For the other appetizer that made up my one 'entree', I found my scallops to be cooked near-perfectly, but one of them suffered from too much char, rather than a nice caramelization. There was also a too-gratuitous use of garnishes, from radish, to micro greens, to apples and more. Less would've been more when the scallops are served with truffles white asparagus. 

The dishes our friends had all received the same comment: heavy. While its summer and seeing the words 'summer truffles' on multiple dishes is never a bad thing, all those dishes all felt so heavy with butter and/or cream. 

I would be remiss if I didn't cap this review with a mention of the bread. Served with dishes containing citrus-infused olive oil, cold eggplant spread and a mascarpone butter, the bread itself was out of this world good (though also heavy, as it's laced with a thin slice of salami and cheese). 

I can't say that my Scarpetta experience didn't live up to the hype. However, like much of Vegas, there was a sliver of feeling that the food itself didn't quite live up to the glitz and glamor of the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"I've been to Scarpetta in Beverly Hills and enjoyed the food there so I was delighted to see another location at the Cosmopolitan. I couldn't find any other review mentioning take out/to go orders and on Yelp, they're listed as not offering take out. The kids in our group really wanted pasta though so I thought I'd call to see if perhaps the information on Yelp was incorrect. They do in fact accept take out orders. The lady who answered my call informed me that she could take my order over the phone or I could come in and order at the bar. 

Ordering was easy and I found the staff to be welcoming and knowledgeable. Scarpetta is known for their spaghetti; however, the regular spaghetti sauce does have dairy and the noodles have egg. They removed the cheese and subbed in gluten free noodles to accommodate the kids' allergies. I myself had the duck and foie gras ravioli. All of our orders were delicious and definitely comprised of quality ingredients. It took about a 10 minute wait to make our order.

I'm glad that they offer take out because they were the only restaurant in Cosmopolitan that readily noted that they offered gluten free options. From my past experience with Scarpetta, I know the restaurant itself isn't meant for kids. Therefore I appreciate that we could still enjoy great food in our hotel room and avoid potentially disrupting fellow patrons' dining experiences. Only caveat is that the serving sizes are on the smaller side - arguably not really a surprise for fine dining. The thirteen year old inhaled his serving of spaghetti and the two year old easily finished half of hers in one sitting."}
{"text":"Better the second time, basic service - very slow, and not happy, but got the job done.

- complimentary bread - pretty good free bread. the best part was the eggplant tapenade and side of butter.
- Beet goat cheese - super cream goat cheese and perfect roasted beets. incredible.
- avocado and tuna sashimi - most fibrous and mushy, low quality flavorless tuna. 
- uni pasta - sweet and salty, chewy and delicious
- brussels - halved roasted brussels, too mushy tasted overcooked. Had better at cut and andreas
- mushrooms - yum
- shortrib agnolotti - im not a pine nut person and could really taste the nuts and not so much of the beef. meh just ok to me.
- pici - thick spaghetti with lobster, spicy, pretty good. my second favorite, would not get again.
- chocolate cake 2.5 stars - sub par mediocre chocolate cake
- marscapone cheesecake 3 stars - very standard circular shaped cheesecake with fruit mixed in it hink, i prefer cheesecake factory."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for Scarpetta since it is so highly rated on Yelp. We made our reservations many weeks in advance and had a nice window seat with a great view of the Bellagio fountains. That was awesome.

Service was overall decent. The bread basket was awesome. I'm not a huge fan of pastries usually but I finished all the bread in the basket. It was that good.

Creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms - This was amazing! We ordered 1 portion to share and they preemptively split the order for us. Cool.

Truffled burrata with roasted tomatoes and salsa verde sauce - This was their daily special and it was super delicious. This is a must order! 

Foie gras and duck ravioli - This was way too rich. We ate a couple of mouthful and had to get it to go :(

Uni pasta - Again, way too rich. We had a split order and couldnt even finish half the portion! :( 

I'm not sure why but both the pasta entrees were just too rich for us and that totally killed the experience :( I wish the waiter warned us more in advance :("}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying out this upscale Italian restaurant, but unfortunately I was disappointed with my meal. My group and I had read reviews prior and wanted to try the duck and foie gras ravioli after seeing so many pictures and positive opinions. Since 4 out of 5 of us ordered the ravioli, I assumed they cooked it in a big batch and maybe missed the seasoning step because each person though it tasted so bland. Thankfully our server took each dish off our bill, because nobody ate more than a few bites. I did get to try the spaghetti and that was really good. I'm kicking myself for not getting something different, but maybe I'll give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Scarpetta is one of Scott Conant's restaurants. He basically does everything right with this one. The food and service were amazing and the view of the Bellagio fountains wasn't half bad either. The homemade pasta's were top notch. I had the spaghetti. It was simple yet done perfectly. To me, that's the ultimate test of a kitchen and they passed with flying colors. There are so many restaurants to try in Vegas, and I'm still going to go back to this place next time I'm there."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Friendly staffs, amazing foods, nice view to the Bellagio water shows and huge selection of wines! This place is perfect for a date, business meeting or just stopping in with the family!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, fabulous service

I had the spaghetti, which is pretty bomb for being just spaghetti. I also tried someone else's steak and it was amazing... I need to return to get my very own.

Dessert - yum!!"}
{"text":"Food is good... portions are medium to small.  

I went with 5 other girls and we had an amazing time.  Service was good, better than average... not great.

One of my friends had a meal that was undercooked but they were gracious and took it back.  

We really liked the view of the bellagio fountains but not every table has a great view.  

Its worth a try, but I won't be a regular here and it probably won't be a place that I suggest to go to.  The food is decent and good, but I've been so many other great restaurants with excellent food at a lower price point.

Overall, good food but overpriced."}
{"text":"Came here for my anniversary dinner. Was seated automatically at the most amazing window view table and the rest could only be described as the best dining experience of my life. We told our server, Roberto, to just pick stuff out for us and there was no disappointment at all. Spaced perfectly and everything was cooked to perfection-- the spaghetti is to die for! A special shout out to Kelli and Dom for coming by the table to check on us and making sure everything went perfect. I'll always recommend everyone to this restaurant and I'll be a patron for life. Bravo team, bravo!"}
{"text":"Amazing, delicious, and the ambience is spot on. Located on the upper floors of The Cosmopolitan, one is struck with a blend of old world and modern elegance.

We were lucky enough to dine in one of their private rooms, with a view of the Bellagio fountains. The prix fix menu for our party was melt in your mouth delectable; and I don't think there was one item that any of us didn't wish we had more of (or more room in our bellies for).

The waitstaff were attentive and made the rest of the experience delightful. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Hands does my favorite restaurant of this year's Vegas trip! The atmosphere was dark, moody and romantic and they quickly sat us next to a window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Watching the fountains go off every 15 minutes gave the meal that additional magic. We started with the basil spaghetti, our waiter split it into two portions so we each could sample it. It was amazing, the fresh pasta, tomato sauce and basil gave it a delicate taste and not over powering. Definitely a must get. My husband had the short rib ravioli and thought it was delicious and very flavorful. I got the salmon and it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The greens were a bit bitter and burnt but that was the only negative we experienced. We finished with a salted caramel custard that was incredible. All the staff worked well together to be very attentive to us throughout dinner too. I'm pretty sure this will become a Vegas staple in our yearly trips!"}
{"text":"Good food at high prices.  That's ok by me.

Have to give a big thumbs up to our server.  Not enough of a thumbs up to remember his name, unfortunately.  Looks like the Asian guy in the last Rambo movie.  Think he's on The Mentalist or one of those types of shows.  He gave it to his straight ie. this dish is no good and try this.  Always appreciated as long as you know what you're talking about.

Duck and foie gras ravioli - Despite being a foodie I am not big on the foie.  But this was a nice, rich, delicate dish.  A bit overpowering on the foie if you ask me but maybe I'm sensitive to that flavor.
Scallops - friends thought it was great.  I don't like scallops.
Steak tartare - pretty darn good.  Believe it was a Kobe beef tartare.  Nice beefy flavor (durrrr) though the accompaniments could have been better.  No toast points, no creamy sauce, no capers, eggs, etc.  Seemed a tad plain.
Spiced duck breast - waiter warned me against this as he thought it has too much cumin.  The cumin smell was indeed higher than even Master Yoda's midiclorian count but it's fate was not clouded by cumin taste.  The taste was strong with this one and more powerful than the waiter could ever imagine.  If anything, the cumin scent gave the dish focus, made it stronger.  (yes I like Star Wars)

Big thumbs up to the bread basket.  There was one with salami or some sort of cured meat with it.  Yummy.  Not sure the marscapone butter was any better than normal butter but it was goody goody."}
{"text":"If you have a bigger party be sure to make a reservation and ask for a table that overlooks the bellagio fountains. The background for dinner was pretty amazing. The view was beautiful. 

Came here for a friend's birthday dinner (happy birthday Aileen) last night and had a pretty good experience. The waiter and staff were pretty friendly but they could have filled the water cups more often. 

Scarpetta offers a complimentary bread basket with a couple different types of bread. One is even filled with cheese and meat!!  It comes with sides of marscapone butter, eggplant and olive oil. They weren't skimpy with seconds so I really liked that. 

I ordered the black tagliolini that comes with Uni, crab and roe. The presentation was beautiful. The roe on top really contrasted the black pasta. I thought it was pretty delicious and the portion size is deceivingly bigger than you think it is. I was super full half way through although I did load up on bread. I did see couple of Uni chunks in my pasta but the flavor wasn't that strong. I would have preferred if the Uni really popped. Overall I liked my pasta. It was warm, very creamy and very decadent. Lots of crab meat as well. I also tried their side of mushroom which was delicious and buttery. 

I thought their spaghetti was just a ok. The waiter said it's very simple but very popular. It had good flavor. The sauce was creamy and on the sweet side but I would definitely try more exotic things on the menu. The short rib agnolotti was super good. It was on the sweeter side with a brown butter sauce but I thought it was delicious!  The portion is less filling so order something else if you have a hungry appetite.

As for the drinks.. They were good and pretty strong but comes but a decent price tag. Most at $16."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I want to give 2 stars or 3. It might not be fair as this place isn't equal to some of my 2 star reviews (it's probably better than most), but for the high price-tag....I think it's justified. The best part of my experience was my $20-a-glass wine. The $$ amount is to be expected in any nice place in Vegas, and I was happy that the wine was at least very good for the price (as they aren't always). Service was so slow, it took almost twenty minutes between being greeted and for the waiter to come back for drinks, and then the same wait from drinks to food and food to the check. We were on a tight schedule being on a work trip, so this was a little inconvenient. It wasn't even busy yet, either. For my food I split the Tagliatelle which I felt lacked in truffle flavor and their signature spaghetti dish which I felt lacked in overall flavor and should not be their signature dish. In general the food was not bad in any way, I just thought it was very expensive for what it was and for the lack of great service. Generally not a bad experience and I might be willing to give it another shot when back in town."}
{"text":"The happy hour is awesome 5:30-7pm. $7 apps and drinks at the bar! I love the duck and foir gras ravioli and the short rib agnolotti! The Limone martini is delicious. For Dinner the pici is absolutely amazing! I loved my experience at the bar and at our table. The staff is great. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I spent our Thanksgiving holiday in Vegas with our respective families.  The original plan for Thanksgiving dinner was to go to Caesars' Bacchanal Buffet, but since we were staying at the Cosmopolitan, the logistics of getting the family together there scrapped that Plan A.  Plan B was to go to the Cosmo's Wicked Spoon Buffet, but the three-hour plus wait resulted in us scrapping that one, too.  As a result, we made our way to Scarpetta since everyone likes Italian (right?) and they could accommodate our party of eight without reservations at 6:30 pm on Thanksgiving Day for dinner.  By this point, we were just happy that we found someplace...anyplace...for dinner.  

We were seated in a nice, small, private room looking out over the Bellagio's fountains to the north.  Matthew, our server, was exceedingly professional and knowledgeable about the menu, offering spot on food and drink recommendations.  We started off with drinks while we looked over the menu.  I had the Billionaire ($16) made with Elijah Craig, pomegranate syrup, Pernod Absinthe, and lemon juice.  Frankly, the cocktail was well made and pleasing, however, for the price, I wasn't impressed with the choice of Elijah Craig as the base spirit unless it was for their 18 or 20 year old stuff.  Of course, since they didn't specify, I assumed it was for the standard 12 year old bourbon.  For starters, the table shared an order of Crispy Fritto Misto consisting of seafood, vegetables, artichokes, herbs & lemon ($18) and an order of Creamy Polenta topped with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms ($17).  All elements of the fritto misto were fried to perfection, crispy, without a hint of sogginess, leaving the mix of shrimp, calamari and octopus tender.  I like polenta.  The polenta was creamy as advertised and as good a polenta as I've ever had.  That said, it was $17 for polenta...a bit pricey.  Chef Scott Conant and his Scarpetta are known for its fresh made pastas, so for my main course, I had the Pici, a thick, spaghetti-like pasta, with lobster, preserved tangerine & bottarga ($36). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=EmJ-zvY2Ihq8gwDluU6IPQ#qPDstnGpczl7IsR5MB4p5g  I'd never had pici before and it was a hearty, filling pasta.  It was tossed with restraint with what I'm assuming was only olive oil, the preserved tangerine, bottarga (a dried, pressed fish roe), and tender chunks of lobster claw meat.  The pasta dish was outstanding as the flavor profile and aromatics of each ingredient were present and in perfect balance.  While it was one seriously pricey bowl of pasta, it tasted like it was worth every bite as it hit my tongue.  The gf and I split a side of roasted mushrooms consisting of trumpet royale, beech, and shitake mushrooms, topped with pecorino and trucioleto vinegar ($11) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=EmJ-zvY2Ihq8gwDluU6IPQ#EmJ-zvY2Ihq8gwDluU6IPQ  It was a nice plate of fungus and excellent complement to my pasta. 

Scarpetta may not have been our first choice for Thanksgiving dinner, but it was definitely a good choice.  The food was well-executed and delivered amazing flavor.  Service was attentive without any hint of intrusiveness.  The only downside was that it was quite expensive and some items seemed overpriced for what was received.  Still, Scarpetta is a fine restaurant and perfect for a special occasion...even Thanksgiving dinner."}
{"text":"Last night, myself and three other people had dinner here. To preface this, I knew we were going to drop a wad... I excepted excellence, I got mediocre at best. First, wine is very expensive; $75 for the least expensive bottle. Second, the food was luke warm. Third, the restaurant was empty yet we were sat in the center of the room pushed up against a pole.
Honestly... I was really excited about this place, and it was a complete let down. I guess this place has a nice view.... I wouldn't know because I was sat at the worst table in the restaurant, even tho it was empty. Out of the 4 entrees we ordered, one was excellent, and the other 3 were forgettable. For the money I spent, I was hoping for something I could tell people about. I won't mentioning this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My wife, friends and I decided to try Scarpetta for the first time. We were expecting a 5 star experience.  Bottom line: We were DISAPPOINTED.

We arrived early and I approached the Hostess area to let them know the 5 of us would have a drink at the bar prior to dinning. I did request a specific type of booth that would accommodate the us facing the Bellagio. She barely spoke to me and had an attitude as if we were lucky to dine in her establishment. She did accommodate us but her attitude had us very DISAPPOINTED. 

The wine list is extensive and has some great varieties. We ordered a bottle for the 5 of us. I noticed other patrons had some special chips at the other end of the bar. None for us? Not from the bartender. After waiting 10-15 minutes I had to walk over to the other side of the bar and get them myself. I then (Jokingly) told the bartender how good the chips were and he said, \"Yes-aren't they!\" Very DISAPPOINTED.

The dinning room is beautiful and we had a wonderful server, Titus. He was knowledgeable and professional. He was a bright spot during the evening. Our group had the endive & apple salad and braised short ribs for starters. They were very good and we highly recommend both.

For our mains we had the spaghetti with tomato and basil (somewhat DISAPPOINTED) halibut (wonderful) and the rib eye (very DISAPPOINTED). Our friend ordered the rib eye medium and it came out very rare. He returned it for more fire and it came our perfectly. The problem was that we ate our mains without him and he then consumed his as we watched him. Very DISAPPOINTED.

I ordered the chocolate souffle for dessert. It tasted very ordinary and seemed as though it may have been frozen.  I know you can't compare any souffle to Eiffel Tower Restaurant but I'm surprised they served a tasteless dessert here. Very DISAPPOINTED.

There are so many fantastic restaurants in Vegas. There were some bright spots but we will not return. We were DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"If you go here at night, make sure you get a good view of the Bellagio fountains because that's half the experience of going here. The other half is the delicious ham and cheese bread they give you. I probably could have just eaten that for a meal.

Anyway, food came out a little slow. The duck and foie gras ravioli was indeed salty as another reviewer mentioned. I did enjoy the short rib agnolotti though. Not sure if I've ever tasted anything like it before."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars?  Dined with a group of 8 last night.  The atmosphere is cool and chic.  We enjoyed the breads and spreads.  The menu changes seasonally so any online searches may get you different or incorrect results.  

The oysters to start were delicious and we shared bites of the braised short ribs of beef.  I had the stracci which is lobster, king crab, and shrimp over thin pasta.  It was good but a lot of pasta to eat.  I had the side of honey glazed carrots with roasted Sicilian pistachios which was very good.  Shared a bite of the brussel sprouts, but  not a fan so can't judge.

The cocktails and wine are extremely over-priced.  Markups on some bottles of wine were at least 300% and up.  I recommend a glass of your favorite to accentuate your email but this is no place to get your drink on.  Save your drinking $$ for after dinner out on the town.

The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Took care of us promptly and with enthusiasm.

Not sure I would return. There are many restaurants still to explore in Vegas, don't limit yourself!"}
{"text":"The BF and I had trouble deciding where to go for our anniversary and he had put me to the task of finding a place with a scallop appetizer and a solid light white fish entree and Scarpetta won out in our short lists of places that fit the bill. 

I love the 50's low lights and bold dark wood grain used in the restaurant. We were seated by the windows to witness a rainy and moody sky (which I happen to like). People said this is a nice view...but there is a large partition on the windows and it happens to be at eye level.  I cant see the water, only the top of the spray of the Bellagio show. It defeated the purpose a little bit....

STARTERS

We started off with the raved about bread basket. There was a stromboli in there rolled with cheeses and salami that was delicious. If I could order that at the lounge I would. There was also sourdough slice, a bread roll, 2 herbed foccacia squares. They give a trio of butter, a eggplant caponata and citrus infused oil. Caponata was lovely and all the bread was warm, soft and nicely crusty.

ROASTED SEA SCALLOPS- which they split onto two presentations for each of us to have one. It was a very fresh scallop, nicely seared. There was a light spice that came through as you chewed it, capers and bottarga on top gave some briny flavor, micro green some bitterness and salmoriglio made for a nice creamy sauce to it. It was served on top of a steak of cauliflower that was nicely roasted. 

DUCK AND FOIE GRAS RAVIOLI with marsala reduction - was one I was very curious about since many rave about this and the spaghetti. I've had the spaghetti before in LA (and did not weep) and now that I actually know the Scarpetta recipe and have replicated it, I wanted to know if something else was rave worthy. This was tasty, but it was just a bit TOO rich for such a big plate of it.  Some may love a whole heap, but I'm glad it was split as a appetizer...and still there was too many for us. We're freegetarians ( semi vegetarians) and don't really have many rich foods since switching over to the dark side..

ENTREE

MEDITERRANEAN BRANZINO - Came with 2 nice sized filets with nicely crisp skin and beautifully flaky meat. If came with a bed of braised leeks, celery root, shrimps, clams and mussels and had a seafood broth reduction as a sauce so it was very clean, sea flavors going on here.

BLACK COD - fish was nice and buttery, with a herbaceous,somewhat anise tasting, tomato glaze and micro chives. It had caramelized fennel & roasted tomato to go with. I've always had black cod aka butterfish in a Asian preparation so this was interesting to try something different. 

The BF preferred the Branzino and so did I.

DESSERT 

ZEPPOLE - with nutella center, vanilla sauce & candied hazelnuts was divine. These were rich pillows of heaven. I love zeppoles and beignets of all kinds and this is among the best I've had. Will come back. Just for these. 

BROWN BUTTER HAZELNUT CAKE - the name makes it sound like it would be more brown buttery cakey thing, but it truly was more about the lemon curd, meringue. I'm slowly growing to like lemon desserts and this was good enough to make me believe in it. It had olive oil gelato & candied hazelnuts to go which gave a light savory aspect to it. This was a great choice to balance out the zeppole since those were just dense and this was bright. 

Service was decent. There was a mixup with the kitchen and our appetizers went to the wrong table at first, back to the kitchen and eventually to us. Service cleared plates and refilled drinks quite frequently and checked on us. A little weird note but in the area we were seated the chef was coming around and talking to tables and even serving one of the tables around us. I guess good that there are regulars but found little awkward as well. 

It was a solid choice for dinner and went home happy. I see they have a vegetarian menu and have a nice lounge area so I would consider coming back for a snack there and those zeppoles...I don't know if I would do a \"all out\" dinner here again though.

The night after our dinner here we went to a establishment off strip and the flavor and quality was on par with better prices, vibe and surpasses in service. 

Overall, Scott Conants place is solid for the Strip and I'm glad it is here, but it was surprisingly not the star of our weekend."}
{"text":"Awesome location, try to get a window seat.. Nice view of Bellagio and Cesar's. Food was great, service was better. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very good location,(Can see well Bellagio water show from window side) And good staff, Good service. Wine also good.
But a meal is not for me, not well bread. Most food feel taste oily,
Take wife or girl friend and just eat appetizer and drink wine, Thats it.
I will never come back here."}
{"text":"I'm such a celebrity chef ho.  But don't let that influence the credibility you assign this review because I'm a discerning celebrity chef ho who tells it like it is.  

This. was. perfection.

I travel a lot for my jobby job and whenever it takes me to new places I always do a quick search to see if any of my celebrity chef crushes have a spot to crash.  Enter Scarpetta.  Everybody knows Scott can cook.  The man is impressive.  And the \"this is the worst thing I have ever put in my mouth\" bravado just adds to his charm (for me anyway).   So when you are slanging that kind of bravado your restaurant better back it up, right?  

It. does.

From the meated butter (yes I said that), to the incredible breads, spicy lobster pasta, to the perfectly cooked duck, to the happy anniversary sweets, there was not one element that was not first rate.  The food was exceptional.  The interior design was exceptional.  The service was exceptional, and the view overlooking the Bellagio fountains.

Exceptional."}
{"text":"I think I might have had too high of hopes.  It would really be a 3 1/2 star rating.  It took awhile to get a cocktail but I understood that we were a bigger party.  The cheeses we got for an appetizer were really good.  I ordered veal even though I know this is more a pasta place but we were getting the spaghetti to share.  The veal was ok but didn't seem worth the cost.  The spaghetti was tasty but I didn't understand the stellar reviews on it.  The service got better and overall I enjoyed the dinner - but just seemed a bit overrated."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian places! The short rib agnolotti is so scrumptious. The little bread crumbs they add on top adds the perfect texture. The sauce is mouth watering. I also really enjoy their spaghetti. It looks small but is so filling. They have a beet salad that is a great appetizer before the filling entrees they have. One time I went their twice in a row for dinner, it's THAT good"}
{"text":"The host seated our party so we got the full view of the bellagio fountains. 

The foie gras ravioli was my favorite. The flavor was rich with the right amount of sauce. I wished the portion was bigger. Wished California didn't ban foie gras as well.

The duck was good as well. Crispy skin and super soft on the inside"}
{"text":"We came with a party of 5 for dinner. Our view was amazing. We were seated right next to the window. We could see the Bellagio water fountains every time it went off. If I were to base my rating just on the ambiance and view of the restaurant, I'd give it a 5. 

Unfortunately, the food wasn't impressive for the price. I had the pici and shared the creamy polenta. The pici had a really good chili pesto sauce. The pasta and lobster was perfectly cooked. But I expected the dish to wow me and it didn't. My favorite dish was the polenta. It was delicious. 

Our server was friendly. I think it's worth a try, especially if you can get a view of the fountains. I think there are other restaurants in Vegas that are great and better priced. I'm not sure I'd come back."}
{"text":"Skip the primi, dive into the secondi.  Scarpetta excels at pasta.

While it is true, a recent trip to Italy has forever altered my perception of Italian food (the reason for the loss of a star), Scarpetta delivers with an Italian chic décor, light spirited service, contemporary plating, and Italian cooking sensibility.

Straight to the pastas.  Plated as a secondi (second course before the main), portions are smaller.  Do like the Italians, save your bread to mop up the left over sauce once you finish the pasta.  Trust me, do it, you'll understand.

The tagliatelle with a truffle zabaglione and guanciale, a take on carbonara is excellent.  All the flavor of carbonara are there, just lighter. The pasta is toothsome and near perfect.

Duck and foie ravioli.  Thin sheets of translucent pasta around packets of duck and melting foie.  Glazed with a sweet marsala and duck stock reduction.  The sauce is enriched with dribbles of foie fat as the little packets are broken open.

Finally, the spaghetti with tomato and basil is a take on amatriciana.  Simple, fresh pure of tomato, hint of fresh basil.  Clean flavor.

Although I'm happy with two or three pastas, most think I've gone foodie crazy so if you must, the  mains.  The spiced duck breast with endive, preserved orange, and cipollini onions is excellent.  Perfectly rendered, the skin of the rare duck is crisp with no cloying underlying raw fat.  It's earthy, ducky flavor cut by the sauce of preserved orange and duck jus creates a very well balanced dish.  Not to be outdone, the fennel spiced black cod.  Hints of licorice taint the delicate flavor of the cod, the acidity of tomatoes and the briny, salty flavor of olives elevate it.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find the mantecato of baccala the menu promised.  All good, the dish worked.

Great wine list.  Heavy emphasis on Italy.  

Is Scarpetta truly Italian?  No.  (You should still tip your server; I miss Italy).  It does however, deliver a great experience."}
{"text":"I'd like to preface this review by saying I haven't had very many fine dining experiences. That being said, this is by far one of the best in terms of food quality and service. Yes, it is indeed pricey, but that should be expected with any fine dining experience no matter where you are.

I can only comment on the dishes I tried, so here they are:
+ Complimentary bread & spread - All of the bread was great. For our spread, we had olive oil, egg plant, and marscapone cheese. I've always preferred butter instead of olive oil, but this one was quite tasty. The olive oil had an almost herbal/spice taste to it. The egg plant is prepared with a tomato sauce or something, so it paired really well with the stromboli bread.
+ Roasted Sea Scallop appetizer - Delicious, practically melts in your mouth. The portion is rather small as you only get two.
+ Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli - Very rich to the point where it was almost a struggle to finish the plate, but it was so scrumptious, I couldn't stop eating.
+ Spaghetti - Probably one of the best I've ever had. Pasta perfectly al dente with just tomato and basil, but the sauce had a creaminess to it that made it divine.
+ Black Cod - Another great dish, but overshadowed by all of the other fantastic plates. It was seasoned well. The accompanying cherry tomatoes tasted so bright. If I ever go to Scarpetta again, though, I'd probably forego this dish and try something else.

Lastly, to expand on the service aspect, our waiter was very personable, cracking a few jokes throughout the night. He was helpful with making suggestions on the menu and explaining everything. Our water glasses never really went low. Oh, and the view of the Bellagio fountain was gorgeous. Only downside is the window divider thing was right at eye level, so we had to look above or below it to see. Definitely a wonderful restaurant for a date night, though."}
{"text":"Love it. Simply elegant food that is cooked to perfection. We were lucky to get good seats next to the window that overlooks the Bellagio fountain that made the meal extra special. The servers were numerous. We had a different person for almost every type of service; one guy who pours the water, another who seats you, another who takes your order, another who brings out the dish. It was very fun to get pampered. 

We split the spaghetti and ordered mushrooms and brocollini as sides. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the tomato sauce is creamy with great flavors. Really a satisfying meal despite it's simplicity. The sides are as amazing as the main dish if not more! Again, we didn't order anything too exciting but the flavors are spot on. 

Will definitely come again and look forward to having the same dishes all over again."}
{"text":"We were seated at a table by the window with a great view of the Bellagio fountains. The atmosphere is the best thing about this place. While the Cosmo pushes the boundary of being too gaudy, even for Vegas, Scarpetta is sleek and elegant in a refined way. The dining room doesn't feel crowded, and while it's quiet enough that you'll sometimes hear other conversations, the noise isn't intrusive.

In addition to wine, I ordered a Pisco Flower off of their cocktail menu. It was well made, but nothing to write home about.

The complimentary bread was outstanding, as were the accompaniments. They brought us olive oil, an olive tapenade, and a creamy mascarpone spread.

We ordered the brussell sprouts, broccoli rabe, and burata as appetizers. The burata was good, as were the pickled beets that came with it. The brussell sprouts cam with apple slices and a cream sauce. It was fine, but would have benefited from more caramelization on the sprouts. The broccoli rabe was just disappointing. Indistinguishable from the version you might get  at a diner or buffet on the side of the highway.

I ordered the fettuccine as my entree. It was delicious, one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. Someone pointed out that it tasted like pizza. This brought it down a bit after seeing that it was true. It tasted like a sausage and roasted pepper pizza, but this wasn't a bad thing. My friend had the famed duck foie gras ravioli, and it fell short. The foie gras filling was rich, but airy and light. It felt incomplete without a heavier component to pair with it. Perhaps my bite missed one of the small dabs of sauce that was strewn about. I didn't try the agnolotti or the spaghetti that were also ordered, but they looked very good.

Our server brought our friend a nice little dessert sampler for his birthday at the end. Service was great throughout, but it felt a bit odd when they began clearing plates before everyone was finished eating.

Overall, had a great time here and would come back."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself was very nice, we got a table right by the window where it had a great view. The menu was very simple. we ordered the braised short rib as an appetizer, the meat was very tender and had lost of flavor. we ordered the duck ravioli and it wasnt as good as people on yelp said it to be. the sauce was a very sweet but bitter sauce and overall wasnt that good. We also had the roasted chicken which was good, but had that same sauce that made it taste funny. We ordered the spaghetti just to try it, and it was very plain, no meatballs, and the noodles were a little harder than what they shouldve been. for dessert, we had the coconut panna cotta that had caramelized pineapples and a guava soup with ice cream which was so good!"}
{"text":"Their cheese bread is amazing!! It might be on a secret menu cause our server was confused, but the lord heard my prayers and cheese bread with salami was delivert! AMEN, spaghetti was coo too!! K bye thankssss"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, delicious food. We had a table of 6 and tried the Pre Fix menu.
Our table was in a perfect spot to watch the fountains - the restaurant was so accommodating- service was impeccable- several dishes were brought out compliments of the chef. Delicious!!
We had a wonderful evening!
I can't wait to visit Scarpetta's again."}
{"text":"This place has ruined me. I'm never going to be able to eat dried pasta again, only the fresh stuff for this girl. But seriously, they MUST have Italian grandmas cranking out homemade pasta by the pound. Easily the best Italian food I've had. Definitely an upscale place. I've had several food items (spaghetti, foie gras and duck ravioli, ribeye, multiple glasses of wine, raw yellowtail, pici, short ribs, and the dessert doughnuts) and every single thing is delicious. Service is perfect, I was never in want of anything. Servers are knowledgeable and passionate about what they're serving. Also wonderful wine recommendations. Something that I din't expect is getting the best steak I've had in this city here. Their ribeye is without a doubt the finest piece of red meat I've had in my life. If STK is too busy (it is), but you still want a great steak, come on over to Scarpetta. You will not be disappointed. Another great thing to mention is the view. Wanna wow your lady with a great view of the Bellagio fountains? Make a reservation and request it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem!  After eating at Chef Conant's other restaurant, D.O.C.G., earlier in the year, we decided to try Scarpetta.  We were NOT disappointed.  I called two weeks ahead to request a signed cookbook.  The manager confirmed he got me a book and confirmed our reservation.  We were greeted with a warm smile and prosecco in honor of our anniversary.  My husband and I did the tasting menu with wine pairings and the staff went out of their way to serve us exquisitely prepared food, as well as a few additional dishes in honor of our special evening.  The pasta was fresh, the product was amazing and the wine pairings complimented all of the dishes perfectly.  Our favorites were the spaghetti and the foie gras ravioli - TO DIE FOR."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous meal at Scarpetta last night!  We split the Heirloom Beet Buratta Salad and Creamy Polenta with Mushroom appetizers.  Both were amazing but the Polenta was the best I'd ever had. The bread basket was also unbelievable.  For entrees, we each had the Spaghetti, which was simple yet somehow unbelievably tasty.  We also shared the filet, which was perfectly seasoned and prepared.  Lastly, we had the Banana Souffle which was out of this world.  In all, the food was among the best Italian dinners that I've had.

Why 4 stars?  The wine menu, while long, has no affordable choices.  We struggled to find a bottle of red under $100, which I think is ridiculous when there are so many amazing affordable wines at cheaper price points."}
{"text":"Well the view alone makes this a spectacular dining experience. Ask to sit near the window when making reservations so you have a nice view of the Bellagio fountains at night. We started off with the creamy polenta with mushrooms and oh sweet god was it delicious. Every single bite was amazing. We then ordered the duck foie gras ravioli and the spaghetti with marinara sauce. I know spaghetti sounds like such a simple thing to order but our waiter was raving about it. He was right- it was done to perfection. I will have to try the Scarpetta in NYC and see how it compares"}
{"text":"Amazing service , food and attentive servers ! It's a trendy quiet place. Great place to enjoy dinner with a view of the Bellagio across the street. Dessert----so beautifully made."}
{"text":"Sexy Italian restaurant with a French spin (they had foie gras). Beautiful indirect views of the bellagio fountains. Delicious pasta. Great wine list. What more could you want? A must try especially if you're staying at the Cosmo."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best meals we have had on the strip.  From start to finish, from the service to the food to the view, there was nothing anyone at our table could say negatively about Scarpetta.

I had the Black Cod which is apparently becoming very chic now.  It was so light and buttery that I only wish I could have had more.  It almost melts in your mouth.  

Going as a group was beneficial because we were able to try several of the pasta dishes and share.  I'm not sure the pastas are enough as an individual entree but probably too much for an individual appetizer...if that makes sense.  They are perfect for sharing.  We went with the short rip agnolotti, traditional spaghetti, and duck foie gras ravioli.  All were awesome, even the spaghetti which was a surprise to those at the table doubting a typical or plain type of pasta was worth a try.

I would also highly recommend the lamb, at least 3 people at our table got it so I was lucky enough to have a bite or two.  It was perfectly cook on every plate and was so tender it was definitely a star of the menu."}
{"text":"From the moment you walked into my life,
Everything felt so right.
From the moment I looked into your eyes,
I knew I had to make you mine...at SCARPETTA! - Jason Chen (solo player original)

The service here is out of this world. Everyone greets you so warmly, not just your own waiter. The view of the strip is spectacular as well. The different types of bread and dipping thingies that they give u complimentary to start the meal was pretty amazing. The duck and foie gras ravioli was really special, really filling (in a good way) and the taste of the filling wasn't overpowered by the sauce reduction. No room for dessert unfortunately although the menu looks pretty simple. Great meal and not at all expensive. If i lived in vegas, i'd come back many times. Try it!

Food: 5 stars --- Service: 5 stars --- Atmosphere: 4.5 stars --- Price(value): 5 stars"}
{"text":"Food:
Foie Gras duck ravioli:  a mediocre sized dish, with oily ravioli stuffed with slim slivers of duck breast and foie gras. maybe foie gras is not meant to be cooked, but it was not a 5 star experience. despite my description it was good, but not great. I would expect more for what i am paying. 

BBQ ribs and bone marrow pasta: another ok meal, with the small chunks of meat in them. 

Seared scallop: VERY delicious. this was a wonderful appetizer, it set the par at which i was expecting the rest of the food to be at, unfortunately nothing did. Very juicy, and the bacon wrapping it was just the right amount of crispy.

Service:
I Hated the service, we had some snobby waiter that was quite rude. no help with description of food, not even a smile. I just didn't like him. Our waters were refilled once. this is a fine dining restaurant, I expect my water to be filled each time i reach half way. For Las Vegas standards this place FAILED miserably. I sit at the far end of restaurant in Bachi burger and my water gets filled constantly. any restaurant, fine dining or not, the people serve with a smile. the food runners were nice enough though. the service did not meet the standards one would expect at a restaurant like this.

The restaurant:
we had a pretty nice view of the Bellagio water works. we were one table away from the window, but it was still nice. the decor was nice too, i liked the way set up, the tables seemed to be stacked higher and higher as they went away from the window. chandeliers were very fancy. the decor met vegas standards. 

all in all probably not going back, not worth the money."}
{"text":"You feel like they put attention to every detail, and not only the food. Just wish they had at least a bottle of red wine below $80 !"}
{"text":"From the outside, it just looks like a regular restaurant with a bar in the front. But as you make your way, the places says fancy all around. I went here with a bachelorette group and it was a nice flashy restaurant to celebrate such an occasion.

The service was great, however, it did take some time for the server to get to us. They were hospitable and made sure everything was set in order for you. Their selection looked great. The dish I chose was $45 (Prime Beef whatever lol I'm not sure what the dish was called). It was tasty but small. I will admit, I like to enjoy my food but I do want some quantity in it as well. For that $45, I would be able to get a bigger piece of beef elsewhere, however, it wouldn't have been cooked by the famous chef and that restaurant. Sadly, I do not ever no who that is. HAHA! Nonetheless, the beef was amazing and tasted great. The side potatoes and mushrooms added flavor to the beef and mixed well.

When it comes to the drinks, I advise you just get it elsewhere. Small martinis or little drinks were $15+ and when it came to wine, just be careful with your wallet! Some bottles are worth over $1500! And that's wine that was bottled in 2002-2005! Just go to the nearest store and enjoy that Stella Rosa!"}
{"text":"Cool place with great food but terrible service."}
{"text":"Jason was absolutely phenomenal! Accompanied by the wonderful Adriana, this team works well together & was very attentive to our group. He is very charismatic & charming. Not only was he a great server, but his personable personality had us laughing & enjoying our time even more. Scarpetta accompanied us with a table next to the window to view the Bellagio water show & helped us celebrate our girlfriends 30th birthday. Thanks for your food recommendations & stellar service!"}
{"text":"My dining experience here was out of this world. The interior of the restaurant was absolutely beautiful, with modern & elegant tables & lighting.  We started off with the wagyu beef tartare and the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms. The polenta was unbelievably creamy and luxurious!  Then my friends and I ordered the tagliatelle, duck & foie gras ravioli, short rib agnolotti, and colorado lamb loin done medium rare. Everything was delicious, especially the lamb. The best part of the night was surprisingly the stromboli that was part of the bread basket at the beginning of the meal - buttery, fluffy slices of bread that was stuffed with salami & cheese. I am going back just for that bread!"}
{"text":"First of all, this place has some great views of the Bellagio fountains- if you can get a good seat. The service is very good and give great recommendations. The lighting is very dim so be prepared to look closely at your menu.
As for the food, the portion sizes for the apps were good for 2 or more to share if you wanted to go that way. Beef carpaccio was excellent and the polenta is a must get, might not want to share that one. The octopus was ok but not fantastic with lots of beans.
Another must get dish is the spaghetti, simple yet stunning. You can add meatballs if you wish but this is just some good old fashioned spaghetti with freshly made pasta. 
For dessert the best thing to share is the budino, but the soufflé was also really great.
The price is a little high so value might be in question but there is no doubt the food quality is off the charts. 

4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Bread basket. It has stromboli. Perhaps not the stromboli you order up at a pizza spot, but it is layers of delicious dough and meat. And, this treat was truly the highlight of my meal. If it weren't for that and the beautiful surrounds, the meal would have been a tad disappointing. 

Since inhaling about 10 of their yellow tail tuna at Taste of the Nation, I have been eagerly awaiting a trip. Of course, we had an order of yellow tail, and I must say the preparation was better at Taste of the Nation. Not sure how serving it up poolside away from their kitchen could produce a superior product, but the seasoning wasn't singing quite the same tune. Nonetheless, it is still a good dish. 

We decided to order the spaghetti because we were told it was featured on Best Thing I Ever Ate. The dish was good, but the tomato basil sauce wasn't unexpected. The flavors were delicious, but in a middle of the road way, not a fine dining way. I have had similar sauces at much lesser restaurants that delivered the same gustatory satisfaction for a much lower price point.

If you are going to dine here, I personally think you should skip the spaghetti despite its hype. For my visit, the food overall hovered around a 3, but the space is absolutely gorgeous especially if you get a seat overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Make that happen, and you've got a very promising spot for a date."}
{"text":"Great short rib pasta, very snobby service. Skip the crispy fritto appetizer - it's a joke. It actually probably was the worst part of our meal. Why is this on the menu? $18 for fried salty breading, really? But good job on the pasta!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Scott Conant fan thanks to Chopped, so while in Vegas, I had to try his restaurant.  We couldn't get in until 10pm, but it was so worth the visit.   I enjoyed the Crispy Fritto Misto to start, followed by the Apple Glazed Kurobuta Pork Chop.  That pork chop was BY FAR the best chop I've ever had.  
Ever!

Like seriously!

It was charred perfectly with plenty of juice from the chop.  I really didn't even need the apricot mustard.  Honestly, I could have had the chop alone.  Well that and the Il Dolce Lemone.  
For dessert, I indulged in the Strawberry Souffle with vanilla gelato.  

Everything was impeccable.  Even the the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli that  I tasted from my cousin's dish!  It was well worth the splurge and would go again.  For sure!"}
{"text":"Mediocre, to say the least.. 

So we decided to try Scarpetta this past week for my significant other's bday, and went into the experience with relatively high expectations, both being big fans of Scott Conant. I'd read up a bit on this resto before making our resos, and they were mostly mixed, but thought what a better way to celebrate a birthday than at a resto with a notable executive chef known for his refined Italian cooking.. 

To start, we ordered the creamy polenta with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms, the duck & foie gras ravioli, and the porterhouse steak (special) with a side of mushrooms & grilled potatoes. 

The ambiance in this resto was cool although a bit vacant and definitely had the air of a restaurant superimposed in a hotel. Not the cool vibe of a funky, independent resto on the Ossington strip. It was quiet inside, granted, it was a Monday night and neither of us expected it to be super happening by any means, so it would be interesting to see how this place shapes up on a weekend evening... Our server was definitely lovely and super personable, and very attentive throughout our meal. 

As for the wine list, it is very extensive for Italian wines (being an Italian resto and all) ;) although I do have to say I wish there was a larger selection of international wines at more reasonable price points (I have had many a bad reaction to Italian wines so I tend to stay away; a sensitivity to the tannins used in Italians so it can really be hit or miss). Although going into an Italian restaurant I don't expect the focus to be on International wines, but for purely selfish reasons I would have liked to have seen more on that note :)  

The Polenta came and went quickly.. It was truly delicious and has kept me wanting more..  Good thing I found the recipe online ;) (Yes, I am making this tonight lol). This course truly set the tone for the rest of the meal... next course was the duck & foie gras ravioli. We shared this between the two of us, and the nice personal touch was dividing the portion into two, for individual servings for us both.. The filling of the ravioli was divine to say the least, but on the note of the fresh pasta, I'd give it a 5/10. Quite gummy and just not the most enjoyable texture by any means.. I've had much, much better fresh pasta on many occasions.. 

Next came the Porterhouse steak topped with truffle butter, with the side of potatoes & mushrooms. The steak was well beyond medium rare (we'd asked for a touch above medium rare at medium-rare-medium), but came out well done.  The cut wasn't the greatest and was quite fatty (Morton's is a thousand times better on the note of its Porterhouse; hence, it being a true steakhouse). We also found it to be really bland and flavourless, even with the truffle butter (this seemed to be the only thing to add any flavour to the meat, and it was just not enjoyable by any means.. we went as far as contemplating sending it back, but the kitchen was closing and we just didn't want to be that couple... As for the sides, there were maybe 2-3 small bits of mushroom on the plate, and a very small handful (say midget?) of potatoes which were so well done they were hollow on the inside (almost like they were deep fried??). At a pricetag of $68 for this dish, I truly would've anticipated far better. Scott Scott... tsk tsk... so disappointed in this item which should've been the highlight of our meal.. :( ! Really disappointing to say the least, especially after having dug out the receipt just today and looked at the total for this one item.. 

From what I have read, Scarpetta does not live up to Conant's reputation and I'd have to agree on this note. I wouldn't recommend Scarpetta by any means (there are much better places in T.O. to check out) but if going, I would highly recommend Conant's signature polenta dish; all other items we sampled left much to the imagination... Mediocre, to say the least, and with a pricetag of $200 for dinner, I would have expected more.."}
{"text":"Wow! Wonderful service; wonderful food; wonderful wine! We loved this restaurant! With no reservation on a Tuesday evening, we had an excellent dinner. Prime Fillet of Beef and Duck Foie Gras Ravioli. The manager greeted us and suggested the perfect bottle of wine. We will certainly tell our friends and family to check this restaurant out when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"I had dinner here a few weeks ago on a Thursday night with my BF and another couple and we loved our experience at Scarpetta.  Everything from the service to the food was well executed.  The decor is dark, hip and elegant.  This is a very cool restaurant in a very cool hotel.  

On to the food:  
We could not get enough of their signature bread, the stromboli, and our waiter happily obliged by bringing us more upon request.  I haven't tasted anything like it anywhere else.  

For starters, we shared the Yellowtail, the Braised Short Ribs and the Crispy Fritto Misto.  The Yellowtail sashimi was good but it didn't knock my socks off.  It just didn't have as much flavour as I would have liked.  However, the short ribs and the Fritto Misto were standouts.  The Fritto Misto is seafood and vegetable dish, battered in a light batter and fried until crispy.  Delish!

For our entrees, I had the black cod and my boyfriend had the tenderloin of beef.  Both were presented beautifully and were perfectly spiced and cooked.  My friend ordered the spiced duck breast and said she enjoyed it.  All of the portions were quite generous in size.  

Our waiter was great.  For dessert, he recommended the Caramel Budino over the Bacio Chocolate Bar.  Since I am a sucker for Bacio, I had to order it anyway while by BF ordered the Caramel Budino.  All I can say is that the Budino was by far superior to the other dessert (and most other desserts I have had).  Our waiter knew what he was talking about.  

I'm already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Long over-due review. Came here for dinner during my bachelorette party in the month of June 2014.  When we arrived we had a bit of a wait.. even with reservations. When we did get seated the view from our table was beautiful, we could see the water show that Bellagio does. Our waiter, can't remember his name was really attentive, asked us how we are doing, if there was anything else that he could get,  the staff kept our waters full AWESOME!! 
Food here is pretty good. We all had different dishes amongst the 12 girls in the group.. That's how we eat LOL. Sharing is caring. Over all great place, great atmosphere, nice people, modern interior, beautiful views."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for Scarpetta. We came on a Sunday night at 6:40PM, a bit late for our reservation but we were seated promptly.

The bread came quickly, and was amazing. There was sourdough, a type with meat in it, ciabatta, and some other small roll. It came with olive oil, tomato, and cheese mixed with butter as toppings, which were really delicious.

The creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms was also quite amazing, especially on the bread.

For some reason though, when our entrees came, everything just went downhill.
The duck and foie gras ravioli just tasted weird and a bit too salty. The short rib agnolotti wasn't very tender or flavorful. The vegetable spaghetti was a bit better and the broccoli was pretty good. Overall though, a bit disappointed. Perhaps it was just an off night."}
{"text":"Went with a large party of 12. The views of the Bellagio fountain were awesome till someone got shot outside and they shut it down.
The food was really great and the service was good.
I had the Beef Ragout Pasta and it was superb!"}
{"text":"Best pasta ever! I love coming to this place. Too bad they closed the one in LA.  They will go out of their way to accommodate you!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty w/ Italian roots

I won't say that Scarpetta is exclusively Italian cuisine, but all the basics are there for quality dining with some very nice views of the fountains outside. Service is top notch with emphasis on your experience being 100%. 

Food quality was exceptional for the money, bar-none. A wide variety of flavor choices for most folks, and some more common choices for the simpler people. Nothing was overspiced as I had become accustomed to at high-end Italian places, which was nice.

Seafood was nice w/ great accompanying vegetables (marinated cherry tomatoes are amazing). Breads w/ prosciutto were impeccable as an appetizer, and the wine selection was pretty damned good (it helps that their wine cooler-thingy is a clear wall).

 I would definitely return when back in Vegas. It also helps that you see some fairly well-known entertainers eat here, which is a decent sign of quality."}

{"text":"I was being lazy and didn't want to hunt around for a place and decided that it's was better to go with the devil I knew.  Remembering to stay away from the salmon. I gave the lamb loin a try. I found it to be incredibly flavorful and tender, yet not gamey.  If you enjoy lamb, this dish is a must.  My date who ordered the chicken was totally envious.  I tried his and would have felt the same way.  It wasn't that the chicken was bad, it just wasn't spectacular like the lamb. I also highly recommend the coconut panna cotta.  Although guava \"soup\" might sound a bit odd, it's what makes the dish so delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! The ambiance is perfect, dark, sensual, mysterious and exciting. High end. Definitely recommend the pre fix courses!"}
{"text":"Scarpetta won't let you down. I went with 2 friends who really know and love food (one of them is a really talented professional chef with years of experience) and we all agreed it was fantastic.

We had the spaghetti, the duck and foie gras ravioli, and the black farfalle to start. And it was all good. The ravioli were off the charts and the other two were good, not amazing but tasty. For some reason when the farfalle came out all the sauce had shifted to the bottom of the dish so at first bite i was like WTF, and then i got to the bottom where all the sauce and lobster were hanging out - mmmmmmmmm. nom nom nom. 

The entrees were amazing. I had the cod, and i tasted the sirloin steak - which was excellent. The deserts were amazing too. We had the panna cotta, the chocolate cake and the nutella filled donut holes and they were fucking rad. 

This is a really pretty restaurant too inside, its beautifully designed and it has a view of the bellagio fountain which is cool. Its a place to take the misses for sure. 

We had 3 appetizers, 3 entrees, 3 deserts and wine and including tip the bill came out to 120 per person. A very reasonable price for such good food and service."}
{"text":"Great pasta. They provide us different bread for free and brought us hot tea. Very nice atmosphere, quiet and romantic. Would come back."}
{"text":"One of the most prestigious dinning experiences in Las Vegas. Apart from the unbelievably amazing food, the service and the view are unparalleled. A must when visiting the Strip."}
{"text":"So after the Rock n Roll Las Vegas 1/2 Marathon I decided it was time to carb up! Wait, do you do that before you run? My beautiful girlfriend flew into town to join me and Scarpetta was the perfect place to take her for dinner seeing we were staying at the Cosmo and it wasn't too far of a walk for my trashed legs!  I had requested to be seated by the windows overlooking the Bellagio Fountains and the table couldn't have been more romantic. We requested the Sommelier and he promptly came to our table and my gal and him found the perfect wine for us. I'm more of a vodka expert. For an appetizer we ordered some oysters, not sure where they were from, but they were smaller than normal yet very flavorful. My girlfriend and I split a couple entrees, the duck and foie gras ravioli and the Colorado lamb trio. The duck and foie gras ravioli was amazing! I know it's not cool to do that to ducks, but I was bit by a duck when I was young and I'm cool with it. Not too mention it was absolutely delicious! The Colorado lamb trio was another memorable entree with what I believe was a lollipop, cutlet and steak. I must say this was a very romantic meal with excellent service and mouth watering food. Scarpetta will always have a special place in our hearts! Thanks"}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to go to Scarpetta! 

We made reservations for 2 and had a nice night. The restaurant is decorated nicely and has nice views of the Bellagio fountain--ask for a table by the window!

I ordered the tuna & avocado to start (soooo fresh and yummy) and my boyfriend got the octopus, which was pretty good too.

For our entrées, the oh-so famous spaghetti and lamb trio. Both of which were delicious! 

All in all, giving four stars because for all the hype and the $$$, it wasn't super spectacular, just pretty good. I'll be back, though!"}
{"text":"The view if you can sit near a window is spectacular - so fun to watch the Bellagio Fountains. The food is incredible, just a bit pricey. If you're willing to spend more, it's totally worth it though. We loved the polenta, spaghetti (really is the best I've ever had), and beef filet."}
{"text":"Scarpetta was good - definitely a restaurant you do have to try when you're out in Vegas. I was there with my husband a couple of months ago - he ordered the NY steak and I got the spaghetti with meatballs. Both were good, especially the steak. Even though the NY isn't the best cut, it was still tender, juicy and flavorful. I was a bit disappointed in my meal because it wasn't traditional; the meatballs were tiny (bite-sized). That's pretty much the only thing I'd change. Other than that, the food and service were great."}
{"text":"5 amazing stars for the duck and foie gras ravioli.  It made my eyes roll into the back of my head, it was so good.

I also tried the spaghetti which was eh in my book.  I mean, it was good.  But Ted Allen told me it was worth $24 and he was LYING.  (Or paid off by Scott Conant, I'm not sure which...)

This place is dim (low lighting) and I can't remember much about the decor.  Hey, it's Vegas, I was on vacation and probably (okay, obviously) was pretty tipsy.  It's a perfect match for being inside the Cosmopolitan.

When I'm back in Las Vegas, I'm not sure that I'll need to come back here, but the memory of the ravioli will last a lifetime."}
{"text":"How do I describe the love? Love, Love, LOVE! I have previously dined at Scarpetta in New York, and was ecstatic to check ou the new space at The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. 

Our server, was hands down one of the best in the business. Full of passion and enthusiasm for his food, we were truly excited for our dishes. Being that we had a party of 5, he removed our menu's from our hands and told us that the chef would be preparing something fantastic for us. We ended up with small plates of 4 courses: starting with appetizers, pasta (duck fois gras ravioli, linguini with black truffle, their famed spagetti); a branzino and meat affair for the 3rd course (Sicilian spiced duck breast, and seared scallops...plus many more items (I believe it was 5 plates for each course) for party to share, which was fantastic! 

Hands down, best Italian meal that I've had in years. I will be back very soon. Ciao!"}
{"text":"The most amazing food I've ever eaten! We tried a variety of menu items, including the entrees, but nothing was as delicious as the pasta dishes. Superb service. Stunning view of the Bellagio fountains! We will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was fantastic. I made a reservation to Scarpetta for my boyfriend's birthday. I requested a table by the window and a surprise birthday dessert. They did not disappoint. I had the best table in the restaurant and they brought out our dessert with a candle and a message. My boyfriend was surprised and absolutely loved the place. The food was delicious!!! It came up out very hot and fresh. The drinks were amazing too. Our waiter was super attentive and very courteous and friendly. Scarpetta made our romantic dinner absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"My second visit in the past couple of years, and the food is simply amazing...amazballs as Usher would say.  Everything is perfection.  My girlfriend is a vegetarian and they separated the bread into two baskets so the bread with the meat was not touching the other bread - that's service, right?

My only complaint would be the noise level, or the size of the two-top at whic we were seated.  I like a hum in a restaurant, but we were too far from each other to speak in our indoor voices and be heard.  If we were closer together it wouldn't have been an issue.  Pretty minor issue, really...last time I was here I sat on the window and didn't notice the noise, this time I was pretty much in the middle of the room between the bar and the window, so that could be it as well.  Perhaps next time we could request a window seat."}
{"text":"Scarpetta is always the restaurant which makes my taste buds sing.  My Mom's Italian and the food here is as good as it gets (don't tell her please). About ten years ago was the first time of many I dined at Scarpetta- being a N.Y. native.  Currently my status is a LV resident, hence I'm a 'follower' now:)  
The interior is nice, but it has a spectacular view of those fountains nearby;)
Please don't eat all the delicious bread, make sure you have room for some of the classic dishes here. 
As you enter into Scarpetta there is a lovely lounge area, which will not disappoint if you failed in making a reservation. 
Desserts, of course all are exceptional! Without divulging a thing about these delicious endings think: Italian. Has anyone ever not liked Italian desserts...precisely;)"}
{"text":"Bone marrow agnolotti was amazing. The other four pastas I tried were below average. Spaghetti was boring, I dislike foie gras. The caramel dessert was awesome. Tiramisu was great. The other two desserts were average. Service was good. Kinda pricey"}
{"text":"Very good food and service.  Wine selection is extensive but could use more quality selection in lower price range.  It seemed like most bottles on the list were over 100 bucks"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and some items were fantastic, but overall...There's just so many other better places.  The octopus was incredible and might be the only reason I would go back - and I don't really love octopus to begin with.  The tomatoes that come with the breadbasket was also really killer. 

Our server was great, got along well with the group, and recommended an excellent bottle of wine for the table.  The rest of the service was a little odd.  We had 5 or 6 of the wrong plates come to the table throughout the meal, including 3 birthday desserts before we had even ordered our food!  Not sure what was happening there. 

We tried the Buratta Salad (always good, no matter what), Tuna Carpaccio (good, but compared to the other raw fish I've had here was unremarkable), Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli (the best entree I had), Short Rib Agnolotti (a little tough), Black Togliolini (incredibly fishy, uni was tough, the crab was overpowered by the rest of the dish, the amount of tobiko was aggressive and given how strongly flavored the sauce or pasta was, it wasn't needed), Spaghetti (real heavy on the basil), Al Ceppo (braised lamb - just fine), NY Steak (well prepared and cooked perfectly, still just a steak though).  We ordered desserts, but I was pretty over eating by the time it all came.

Overall, this place was just a little too hit-or-miss for me."}
{"text":"After a fantastic visit to the NY location four or five years ago, I was excited to eat at Scarpetta again. Unfortunately our experience at the Vegas location was a huge disappointment. The food was still delicious, but it was completely eclipsed by the terrible service we received, and we left with a bad taste in our mouths despite that scrumptious pomodoro. Our surly server wore a perpetual scowl, avoided our eyes when we tried to flag him down, and seemed eager to flee the table as soon as he unceremoniously dumped our food down, without waiting to see if we needed anything else. You would think he didn't WANT us to order more cocktails or courses. Getting a basket of that delicious bread proved extremely difficult, let alone a second one. Worst of all, towards the end of our meal, three of us had finished our entrees, but two of us were still eating our shared pasta, when the servers started clearing plates, including said hard-won bread basket. They literally cleared every plate from a six-top except the one we were eating from. WHAT?! No. Unacceptable. Rule no. 1. Do not clear until everyone has finished eating! I cringed for the waiter but I was also very disappointed and shocked to experience this kind of service at a high end, expensive restaurant. Needless to say we felt rushed out and couldn't savor the last bites of our meal because everyone else at the now empty table was sitting there twiddling their thumbs. Going to a nice restaurant isn't just about the food - it's about the service, atmosphere, and overall experience. This is true everywhere but especially in Vegas. Scarpetta failed miserably on this front."}
{"text":"I am a Las Vegas local and on a tuesday night during the \"Magic\" convention, it was my girlfriends birthday. I was unable to get a reservation for her birthday. I went and spoke with the manager, Kelly, who said she would do whatever she could to help me out. When we arrived at the restaurant she said she would see what she could do. We grabbed a drink at the bar and 10 minutes later we were told our table was ready. I was expecting the small corner in the table, but was pleasantly surprised when we were seated at probably the best table in the restaurant. The last table right next to the window which gave us an incredible view of the Bellagio fountains. Titus our waiter was excellent! The food was incredible as always! The night turned out amazing all because of Kelly. Great manager!!!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Wednesday evening for a company meeting. Our menu consisted of a full course meal: 
Primi - Served Family Style
1. Creamy Polenta - Fricassee of truffled mushrooms
2. Heirloom Tomato Salad - Burrata, marinated eggplant 
Pasta - Served Family Style 
1. Spaghetti - Tomato and Basil 
Piatti - Individual 
1. Fennel Dusted Black Cod - Concentrated tomatoes, mantecato, black olive oil 
2. Organic Jidori Chicken - Mustard spatzle carrots, fegato sauce
Dolce - Served Family Style
1. Amedei Chocolate Cake - Toasted almond gelato, salted caramel sauce

- Hard to find! Literally, it's like a crevice on the third floor of the Cosmo! WTF, weird entrance. 
- Nice staff. Presentable dining area for larger groups. Fast at wine refills. 
- I loved the spaghetti! Although simple, the noodles tasted great! The flavoring was fresh and rich. 
- Their polenta was unremarkable. Cornmeal boiled in porridge. I prefer simple mashed potatoes. 
- Fresh tomato salad! Loved the ripe tomatoes. But awkward to eat as family-style. 
- The chicken was soft and tender. Not too salty. I'm glad I got this over the Cod. Although the cod was flavored nicely, I didn't like picking some of the bones out of it. 
- Dessert was amazing. Not too sweet, but the correct balance to end of the meal.
- Overall, nice plating and nice night."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and our table had a nice view of the Bellagio Fountain. It's beautiful here. Our server was fantastic. He knew I was trying to save room for dessert. We were given a bread basket that included stromboli. Yum!

Creamy Polenta:
This had mushrooms and truffle oil. The consistency, aroma and taste were superb. I can finish a bowl of this and still want more. 5/5

Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli:
The pasta is shaped like a duck's tongue. It has balsamic reduction on top. If you like foie gras, you'd enjoy this. 4.5/5

Short Rib and Bone Marrow Agnolotti:
This and the spaghetti are my favorites on their menu. It's meaty, rich and tasty. It has crunchy bread crumbs so you get that texture. 5/5

Spaghetti:
Spaghetti should be real simple. Noodles, olive oil, fresh tomatoes, basil and cheese. Anything extra is plain overdoing it. Cooked perfectly al dente. I get an extra order to-go for lunch the next day - the noodles get softer but soaks up all the flavor. 5/5

Nutella and Vanilla Bomboloni:
Italian doughnuts filled with either Nutella or vanilla. Comes with a side of banana gelato. The filling is a little thick - it's not just straight up Nutella. 

Amadei Chocolate Cake:
Dense chocolate cake with a side of salted caramel gelato. 4/5

Proseco, delicious food, good company and a spectacular view...life is beautiful!"}
{"text":"First, I met Mike Tyson when I dined here! And we danced in the middle of the restaurant. So an extra star for that!

Scarpetta is a beautiful restaurant. Beautiful Earth tones and a intoxicating view of the Bellagio fountains.

Scarpetta is one of those fancy restaurants with menu items that no one really knows how to pronounce; needless to say, I just ordered and hoped for the best. And the results we're favorable!

I could mention what I ate/ordered, but this place doesn't offer a fixed menu. It's seasonal and changes because your quality freshness. Everything that was order was amazing. There's a bread basket... I could have kept eating that and been a happy camper. There were several variations, my favorite was the stramboli (not the American version - I asked the server what it was because it was slap yo' mama good!), it's a combination of fresh bread and meat. It was a joygasm to the mouth! The bread basket is served with a fancy whipped butter, a roasted eggplant dip, and olive oil. 

I order the yellow tail app (which they always have) and it did not disappoint. Fresh and tasty! I ordered a pasta dish (no idea what, who, where, why, yaddda, yadda, insert fancy words and culture here) and it was flavorful and light. The portion size was perfect. Not too much or too little. Seriously, I don't think you take doggy bags from places like that.

We ordered several desserts and they were all great and small enough to not get stuff and big enough to share.
 
They have an extensive wine list and it covers an entire length of a wall. It's a pretty sight.

The service was impeccable. Spot on. Courteous. Attentive.

Overall, Scarpetta was de to the lish. If I could afford it, I would definitely go back in a minute! I yearn for you Stramboli. Definitely not your traditional Italian, but a great modern twist."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant while I was waiting for seats to open up from other near restaurant in Cosmopolitan.

From the outside, the ambiance seemed pretty romantic and we thought we'd give it a try since we've been to the other restaurant.

As we were guided through the narrow hallway, we came up on this bigger and even more romantic side of the restaurant. There were big windows for the beautiful view and big and small tables for big groups or small.

Service was fantastic. It seemed that every workers had different role. Hostess seated us, manager-looking person greeted us and guided us through the menu, server brought bread and explained the ingredients in detail, and another server served us delicious food. Every one of them were so professional.

To match with everything above, the plates we ordered were exceptional. Sadly I live in LA and will have to wait for another trip to Vegas to try those again. We had Spiced Duck Breast and Tagliatelle. Duck was cooked just right. It was little crispy on the outside and so soft on the inside, it melted in my mouth. Tagliatelle pasta was so creamy and rich. I usually don't chew much when eating but this time, I made sure I didnt swallow the food too fast ;).

I would strongly recommend this place to everyone. I'm so glad I stumbled upon this place. This place really did worth every dollar I paid for."}
{"text":"Scarpetta was not worth it. I spent about 260.00 for two people including a 45 dollar tip. We didn't have wine. The scallop was pretty good, the foie gras ravioli was ok, we had a steak dish that I can't remember because it was that forgetful. finished it off with gelato, which I could have cared less about. The service was great, the decor was nice but boring. In general I was extremely underwhelmed. If my bill would have been about 50 dollars cheaper I would say this is a good place to take a friend or business partner, but not a date or someone who you'd want to share a meaningful or memorable evening with. However, since Scarpetta was not 50 dollars cheaper, my conclusion is... go somewhere else. There are much better places."}
{"text":"Our server started us out with an array of different breads, accompanied by mascarpone butter, an eggplant tomato caponata & citrus olive oil. I often tend to judge a meal as soon as the bread (or chips... etc) arrives to the table. First impressions are crucial! If you ever dine at Scarpetta, dig for the warm stromboli loaf in your bread basket first! It pairs really wonderfully with the caponata, but also stands strong on its own. You definitely want to eat this bread while its hot- because its stuffed with layers of salami & mozzarella. YUM!

My first course was Braised Short Ribs of Beef over a farro risotto. The beef was immensely tender & alive with flavor. It had a very thin slice of parmesan resting on top of it, just barely melted. Nice touch! I loved how hearty the risotto was- this is nothing my Mom would have ever prepared for me...but somehow the risotto tasted home-y. I didn't even have time to identify all the vegetables that were in this dish, because I was far too busy stuffing my face. Between bites of the short ribs, I had a few pieces of raw yellowtail. Incredibly fresh, with such great flavor. Unknown to me at the time, it was adorn with almost microscopic red onions (GROSS)...but I ate each piece very willingly- despite my hatred for onions.

For my main course I had the Aged Sirloin of Beef. It was served with wild mushrooms, potato gnocchi & barolo ragu. Everything on the plate was exceedingly juicy & robust, without being overwhelming. The gnocchi was a great equalizer to the sirloin and the ragu. This dish was really unforgettable, hats off to Scott Conant.

Dessert was very simple! Coconut Panna Cotta served with coconut sorbetto, pineapples & guava soup, ofcourse this is my pick- being a true Hawaiian & all. I could have done without the crushed pineapples, I felt like they interfered with the guava coconut vibe I had going. I had mentally prepared myself for the guava soup to be too sweet, but fortunately, I was incorrect. In addition to that, I was thrilled with how smooth the panna cotta was. Each bite was like silk!

In short, I LOVED Scarpetta. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Amongst the Cosmo's array of excellent restaurants, Scarpetta is definitely one of my favorites.

Hubby & I had reservations for 9:30 pm but we were running a little behind (story of our lives). We ended up getting there at 10:30 pm, and the hostesses were still so sweet despite our late arrival! We even got awesome seating with a view of the Bellagio water fountains, per Hubby's request of course. It's overall such a romantic venue with dim lights and soft lounge music.

You start off with complimentary bread, and it's honestly the best bread I've ever had. The basket has an assortment of different breads and condiments. The winner was the Stromboli- soft Italian bread filled with delicious cheese and salami. Ugh, orgasmic!

We also began with Raw Yellowtail which was topped with a ginger oil and pickled red onion. For a steep $18, it was rather disappointing. We each only got 2 bite-sized pieces of fish. Very tasteful fish, but still a let down.

My entrée made up for our appetizer. I ordered the Short Rib Agnolotti- fresh pasta filled with tender beef. It was a mouth-watering combination of sweet brown butter and toasted breadcrumbs. So delicious!

Hubby ordered the waiter's recommended Pici, a pasta colored green by chili pesto. He thought it was a bit salty, and our sides were on the salty side as well. We shared an order of mushrooms & corn, which were both bursting with flavor. It was so much food, we left with some to-go boxes.

Since you can never be too full for dessert, we ordered the Strawberry Soufflé with berries and vanilla gelato. We almost ordered a second one, a strong indication of how yummy it was. It tasted exactly how I'd imagine clouds would- Sweet, light, & fluffy. What was even sweeter was the \"Happy Birthday\" message written on the plate next to a candle. You just can't beat thoughtful service like this. :')"}
{"text":"As good an experience as you can have in a restaurant.  All of the food was incredible, especially the octopus and the spaghetti."}
{"text":"I have been to Scarpetta twice and both times were very different. The first time was amazing and my favorite item on the menu was the Goat. So I was very excited to return to have this again.

Second visit, no Goat. BOO!! What the hell, that was so good- bring it back. The food was still great and service was excellent of course. This was my order.

Apps: RAW YELLOW TAIL, and HEIRLOOM BEET SALAD- Both were really good.

Paste: SPAGHETTI Tomato Basil- OMG to die for, homemade pasta people!! 

Pesce: MEDITERRANEAN BRANZINO- You can never go wrong with this fish.

Contorni: BROCCOLI RABE

Dolce: NUTELLA & VANILLA CREME BOMBOLONI and MASCARPONE CHEESECAKE anything with Nutella and Mascarpone is good.

This restaurant has a great ambiance, great service and great food. Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a 20 person set menu dinner. Scallops, beet salad (goat cheese YUM) and ravioli were delightful.  Filet did not compare to previous night's red meat but was still fine.  Should have sat on the other side of the table so that I could have enjoyed a strip view during the 3+ hr meal."}
{"text":"One of those places where you will stare at the menu over and over and still not be quite sure what you are ordering, yet at the very same time, still have it be one of the best meals you will ever consume. 

The ambiance to begin with, is just gorgeous. You almost can't help but to feel up the soft, velvety walls as you watch the Bellagio fountains go off. Service, as expected is excellent. 

And of course the food, wow. From the delicious variety of bread to the spaghetti, as well as the steak were to die for. 

What most impressed me, were their portions. It seems as if they know exactly how much a person requires to eat to feel satisfied. For a pasta dish like the spaghetti, you think you are getting a small amount, but take that fork and start eating, and you'll realize that there are endless amount of noodles within that little bowl.

Now, I know that there is a Scarpetta here in LA, but on this lucky night we actually got to eat food prepared by the famous chef Scott Conant himself. I don't know if that makes a big difference or not but after finding out he was our chef, it definitely justified the perfection of our meals."}
{"text":"Easily made reservations via OpenTable earlier in the day for a prime time on Friday night.

When my date and I arrived, we were quickly seated and they checked our coats for us. They have a very respectable wine selection and presentation of their stock. The acoustics were very good; even sitting at an table near the middle, we were able to converse with regular voices. Service was quick and very polite. I ordered the roasted duck and was very pleased with the dish. My date ordered the cod filet and wasn't so thrilled, but loved the squash soup appetizer.

For dessert we shared the chocolate cake with almond gelato and it was amazing.

I will definitely return to this hotel and restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"My friend and I just randomly searched for an italian restaurant and then found this. The service is great. The waiter was very patient. He gave many useful recommendations for us.  Tuna &avocado: I think it is tuna sashimi and avocado with a lite lemon juice. It tastes healthy and delicious. Filet steak: I ordered for medium. OMG, it is perfect. My friend ordered black tagliolini and scallop. She loves both of them so much."}
{"text":"I mostly frequent the Scarpetta in Miami, but while in Vegas last month we stayed at the Cosmopolitan and decided to give this location a whirl.  We are big fans of the spaghetti in Miami and wanted to see if it would be the same.

Who would have thought that an unassuming spaghetti dish would be so amazing?  It doesn't even have any meat in it and it is so good!  I get my own because I don't like to share it.  If you want to try other things, it's great to split because it is very rich....cheese and cream, and butter...oh my!   The bread is delish, especially the stromboli, love the accoutrements, olive oil, mascarpone butter, eggplant spread. The heirloom tomato salad is always a good stand by as well.  We had the scallop appetizer this time, and it was very good.  We never really have room for dessert, and had to catch a show, so we passed. Maybe next time we will try the panna cotta.

All in all, I still love the Miami location better. The service is pretty consistent with both locations, just a different slightly more relaxed vibe in Miami.  Besides, who can beat a view of the ocean and the sleek, modern, nautical decor of Scarpetta Miami."}
{"text":"The BEST bread basket. The BEST pasta. The BEST dirty martini. There is nothing to complain about here. I went here twice. It is that amazing."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Dim lighting. Romantic. Service: Awesome. Very knowledgeable, nice and attentive server. Bread: 5 different kinds with 3 spread/dipping options. Really enjoyed it. Appetizer: Short Rib Risotto- Good. Nothing more nothing less. Entrees: Agnolotti was okay. The \"brown butter\" in the description got me hoping for The Old Spaghetti Factory's Brown Butter Mizithra dish, but it was nothing like it. Rich, but not salty. And I like salty/savory. Best part was the crispy/crunchy texture in some bites. Hubs got the tried and true spaghetti. He liked it a lot. Noodles cooked truly al dente. Again, not as savory as I like, but... satisfied with the quality. I like super bold and flavorful dishes. This is definitely a restaurant for those with a more \"refined\" palate. Drinks: A greenish martini with a basil leaf in it, I forget the name- refreshing. Two dirty gin martinis- strong and actually dirty. Two Macalllan 12s. Total bill before tip: $180. Probably won't come back with all the options Vegas has to offer, but 4 stars because there's no denying it IS a nice restaurant if that's your type of thing. :)"}
{"text":"I cannot give less than 5 stars to this place!,.. Everything there was just great!!... The service was excellent!... And the wine was very good!!. We followed the recommendations from our waitress and tried 3 different wines, every wine was better than the one before... I still don't know which one I liked better.. The food was delicious!!.. As an appetizer we had the prawns with sambuca, and they were fresh and very tasty... The gnocchi and the pasta were excellent!!.. And the beef was delicious!!.. I would definitely go back there!..."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fancy meal to splurge on, look no further. We were looking for a $$ place but this is more of a $$$ in my opinion. However, it was WELL worth the money!

I called and got reservations day of at 6 pm, when they open. I had asked for seating near the windows as I had read that there was quite the view. They said they cannot guarantee this but we ended up with an AMAZING view of the Bellagio fountains and most of the strip at sunset.... the view alone was at least 4 stars!

But then.... the food.... OMG. The bread basket they brought us was an appetizer in itself. The stromboli with broccolini was my favorite! (Vegetarians, you can ask for the stromboli without meat to be in your bread basket.) In addition, the other bread was awesome and it came with citrus olive oil, marscapone butter and some sort of eggplant antipasto. We ordered a side of the broccolini to share and two entrees: the halibut (this was a special) and the spaghetti.

Why, you might ask, would you pay over $20 for a small plate of spaghetti? Because this unassuming dish was bursting with flavor and freshness. The pasta was homemade and perfectly al dente, the sauce was just chunky enough and the fresh ribbons of basil were the perfect garnish. My husband said he didn't miss the meat and it was just perfect- however you can add meatballs for extra money. The Halibut was also perfectly done: crisp on the outside and white and flaky on the inside. It was served with potenta and grilled artichokes. An excellent dish if they have it on special when you go!

You thought it couldn't get better? Well you are wrong. The service was ON POINT. Our waiter(s) were checking in on us the perfect amount of times, our water glasses were always full, and we were asked if we wanted another drink two sips before we finished the first. It is obvious that customer service is high quality here- from the wait staff to the host to the kitchen staff.

HIGHLY recommend if you are looking for a place to treat yourself to a wonderful dinner!"}
{"text":"I've been to Scarpetta LV 3 times so far. Great bread basket, \"more Stromboli please!\" Recommend the Spaghetti. Which is strange because I never order Spaghetti when dining out, this ones special though. Black Tagliolini was delicious and some pasta filled with short ribs, I forget the name of it but it's different and probably isn't like anything you've had before. Order and share the Dry Aged Sirloin to accompany your pasta. It's a perfect fit, especially with the Spaghetti.

Dessert? Skip it. Had em all and not one I would order again, and by this point you'll have spent enough money.  Thought about giving Scarpetta 3 stars, not because of food but because of price, e.g. \"the handmade in house pasta\" spaghetti is $24. But I had to take into consideration of the convenience of being located on the strip and that location with it's great fountain views cost money."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant, we were a party of 5 and we each ordered something different: spaghetti with tomato & basil, polenta, fetuccini with lamb & rapini, filet mignon, and the lamb, it was all great and we all left very happy and satisfied.

Although the entrees were great, I could not get enough of their fabulous bread (specifically the stuffed bread) which I used for my own scarpetta, my plate was wiped clean. I will definitely visit the location in LA where I live, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The BEST dining experience ever! Scott Conant's sophisticated yet soulful dishes were nothing short of decadent. Started off with the short ribs; then the duck and foie gras ravioli (our favorite--so good!); I had the spiced duck breast, and my hubby had the halibut. Halibut was delicious! My duck had a little too much star anise in the rub. Ended with the napoleon, so yummy, I cleaned the plate. We sat right next to a window and had a great view of the Bellagio water show. Had a wonderful time!

And the service was impeccable! The staff was very professional and friendly. According to our receipt our waiter was Asato. Great guy. Next time I hope to catch Chef Scott there!"}
{"text":"Like other reviewers, I'm not a big fan of Scott Conant, a judge on the TV food show Chopped. Not sure if that's his real life persona or his made for TV Simon Cowell-like persona that makes for good ratings. I broke down and went to Scarpetta, totally prepared to hate the place. As much as I wanted to hate it, I loved it. It's always interesting to read the reviews and see the swings, with one reviewer hating it and the next loving it. It's usually the total experience that somehow helps make the food more or less memorable. It was totally memorable for me, from being with my wife to the Bellagio fountains to attentive service to the food being timely served, perfectly prepared and beautifully presented. The bread basket was all artisan selections, a meal in itself. The creamy polenta and truffled mushrooms were heavenly. The spaghetti was as good as spaghetti gets....there's only so much you can do with it and I thought the sauce was outstanding. The black cod melted in your mouth and was a work of art. The coconut panna cotta was the most interesting, striking and palate pleasing dessert I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place was ridiculous! Came during my stay in Vegas for Infocomm with some Law Firm associates. All from NYC, so we were on the hunt for a good Italian place in Vegas, and we found it!

Great bread basket. Great apps. Great entrees. Great wines. Great desserts. Great ambiance. Great lighting. Great views. 

Loved it!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to dine here  for my first night in Las Vegas. When we arrived, the hostess was quite snarky when we requested to move one table over from her suggested table. Although the service was friendly, not once were our waters refilled nor was the table cleaned before the arrival of our dessert which you come to expect when dining at a place like this. 

For our appetizer, we split the spaghetti. Decent but from my own personal dining experiences, the spaghetti did not warrant the hype. For our entrees, the bf and I dined on the duck  and short rib ravioli. We seriously could have passed on these two dishes.  They were forgettable and only made us reminisce about similar versions of these dishes that we had in the past which were not only better but cheaper. For dessert we ordered the strawberry soufflé. By the time the dish arrived  the gelato on top had already melted adding to the mush of butter and bread within the ramekin. 

All in all the best part of the meal was the complimentary bread. While I will not return, I can see aspects of Scarpetta that some foodies may enjoy."}

{"text":"Ah Scarpetta. Restaurant of my all-time favorite judge on Chopped-Scott Conant, every episode I ever watched featuring Scott added a grain of sand on top of the ever growing mountain that was my dream of dining at Scarpetta. By the time I finally walked through those doors it was an Mount Kilimanjaro sized monstrosity of a dream. I was so giddy I took a picture with the frickin sign. I mean this was it! I was going to eat pasta the way it HAS to be sauced up and cooked, I was about to have a symphony of flavors dancing their way onto my modest palette opening my eyes to a culinary world that which I have never experienced in my 24 years. I was about to be blown away. 

We're seated by the window with a nice view of the Bellagio water show. Oh things were going as I expected at this point. 

Our server was nice, in a very proper, sophisticated, would not smile more than a 3/4 grin, and maintained an impressive monotone demeanor kind of way that which you expect at such a dining establishment. Everything is going according to plan. 

We order the short rib risotto appetizer to share and I decide to get the roasted chicken as my entree while my partner in crime got the so raved upon spaghetti. As we waited for our entree the bread basket came out. There was a variety of different breads some stuffed with salami and cheese, and others with spinach and garlic all served with olive oil, cheese spread, and olive tapenade. 

Holy crap. I ate this bread and thought oh my god this is it, this is what I've been missing. The flavor was bright and salty, the outside was crusty and chewy but the inside was tender and soft. Dip that into the olive oil and you're in heaven. I'm literally on cloud 9 at this point....

Out comes the short rib risotto that they kindly split into two plates. 

First impression: Are we minions? I mean I know it's \"gourmet\", and I know we split it. But I kid you not when I tell you my portion was probably 2 tablespoons. IT'S OKAY THOUGH we're at SCARPETTA. I took a bite. The piece of short rib was juicy, soft, and boldly flavored. I liked it. The risotto was pretty good-the vegetables still had a nice crunch and it was a nice little bed for the short rib to sit on. Not blow my mind amazing, but good! Pretty good!

Okay the entrees! We get our hot plates and gracefully decide to not mention the fact that both of our dishes combined could probably hide behind an IPhone 6 Plus. We couldn't risk ruining the moment. But after taking a bite of my Japanese raised chicken that had eaten nothing but the finest grains before being swiftly beheaded, and brined in an anise spiced mixture for days before arriving at my disposal....I realized something. It didn't taste good. In fact it didn't taste like anything. I could hear Scott ripping a contestant to shreds for making chicken thats dry and needs a sauce, vegetables that have no love, and an overall dish with nothing bringing it all together. How could this be the cooking of the man whose every critique I felt I could so passionately agree? 

After I had a bite of the spaghetti was when the depression truly set in. Not only was I excited to try this dish because of Scott's particular distaste for a mediocre bowl of pasta, but Ted Allen also picked the dish as the best thing he ever ate on Food Network's show as well. This dish had so much going for it. 

Verdict? So painstakingly ordinary. The sauce had nothing really special about it-it was a bland, under seasoned tomato sauce, and for being homemade the pasta didn't really have that chewy bite you'd expect. Oh let me also add that it was a 9 bite portion (we counted). 

Needless to say we decided to skip dessert, and I the girl who pranced in Scarpetta walked out like a little girl whose mom lost her bunny rabbit because she wanted her to \"play\" outside. Oh wait...that was me too. 

Scarpetta, you disappointed me-and for that I nominate Scott to the chopping block. I think I'll stick with Alex Guarnaschelli's opinions for now."}
{"text":"If you want a lot of pompous attitude, and pay a lot for average food this is the place for you.  Don't order the braised beef rib.  You will leave hungry and who puts cheese on their ribs.  That's a shame.  Don't expect to eat healthy either.  The cocktails were very good though, so I would recommend the bar.  The restaurant also has an amazing view."}
{"text":"Dark, moody and intimate...my kind of place. This restaurant just oozes class and sophistication. A definite welcome from the debauchery taking place right outside. (No joke...I went to the restroom by the entrance and some girl had tossed her cookies alllll over the floor.) I mention this because I felt like the Cosmopolitan was starting to lose its appeal for me. It's definitely a different crowd from what it opened to a couple of years ago.  But Scarpetta has really turned it around for me.

I'd been wanting to go to Scarpetta in LA for awhile so I was SUPER excited when we came upon this location after finding a long wait at Jaleo. Since it was a Saturday night, we decided to push our luck and ended up with a booth tucked away in the lounge/bar. Perfect. 

The service was amazing from the get-go. Started off with the delicious Gallardo with Hendricks for me, and a proper margarita for my man. We were starving so we inhaled our bread basket of rosemary foccacia and stromboli with marscapone butter and eggplant cabonata. That right there? Best bread basket EVER. Moved on to the most amazing, melts in your mouth short ribs over a bed of farro and veggies. Originally, the farro was for me and the short ribs for my bf but I had to take a bite when I saw his eyes roll over. Then onto our entrees of spaghetti and Colorado lamb. I have to admit, that spaghetti was super overhyped for me. I really liked it, but I expected too much for a simple plate of well executed pasta with tomato sauce. Don't get me wrong...it was delicious, but I'd choose differently next time. The lamb was, however, declared the best lamb he'd ever had.

We were stuffed by then but we couldn't resist dessert. I chose the browned butter cake with figs and poached pears because I just wanted the pears, heh. Our awesome server brought me a taste of aperol to pair with it - what a perfect way to end our meal.

When we were discussing our fave meals from the weekend, we both agreed this was by far the best. In fact, I'll go as far as saying it was one of my best meals in Vegas ever. Thanks for an amazing time, Scarpetta."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  
Dinner at Scarpetta was the last of 3 amazing Valentine gifts.  I wanted to come here because I'm a fan of Scott Contant, and I was not disappointed. 

Our meal was absolutely fantastic, the service was top notch and the atmosphere was perfect.

We started with a light and delicate glass of Wine to go with Creamy Polenta and a Fricassee of Truffled Mushrooms, I had the Short Rib Agnolotti and Dave had the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli, both were amazing and you know it had to be for me to eat Foie Gras :-)  We ended the meal perfectly with Pana Cotta and Bomboloni. 

I highly recommend you come here when celebrating your next special moment, or, if your just in the mood for a perfect evening with the one you love."}
{"text":"Happy B-Day to ME!!!

Okay we decide to do vegas for my bday and I've been wanting to try out this place.  My good work friend of mine recommended it...shout out to Frank M. for the recommendation.

So I completely forget it's in vegas cause i'm a guy and have the attention span of a 2 year old.  But the wifey thinks of everything and yes I know I'm lucky and yes I tell her frequently.

We ordered:
Bread Basket - Wow!  GREAT START!  

Creamy Polenta - Magical buttery love potion.  Add to anything to make it better.  You can put this on cardboard and enjoy.

Roasted Sea Scallops - Cooked to utter perfection.  Texture was great.  Had a hint of fish to it but I loved it.

Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli - Although I have an extreme love of Foie Gras, this dish was just okay for me.  The texture and temperature of the Ravioli didn't mesh well with the Foie and it just clashed.  I had high hopes for this one.

Spaghetti - This was supposed to be my highlight.  I even went online and made this dish based on raves I've heard about it.  I have to say I wasn't impressed.  The spaghetti noodles were too thick and didn't have that homemade taste or texture to it.  It was served too cold for my taste as well.  Maybe the size of our group affected my experience here.  VERY SAD MOMENT when it hit my palette.  I probably should have asked them to redo it but the vodka had already soaked in and my enthusiasm was curbed.

Black Cod - Just a fish on a dish.  Flavors were okay but this didn't do much for me at all.

My worst fears had materialized.  The moment when you start so fast in the direction of brilliance just to be let down along the way.  I wouldn't say it was a complete let down as the dishes were all pretty well put together, however, that's all it was.  Great shit thrown on a plate...I didn't feel inspired...I wasn't brought anywhere...I was just at a restaurant in Vegas eating with my hot wife and a group of great friends.  It would have made the night perfection if the experience matched the bill.

*Thanks wifey for the extremely thought-filled dinner plan - You're loved*"}
{"text":"I was very very excited to come here while on a girls weekend to Vegas. Both my friend and I thought this would be one of our highlights!

Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype in our visit. My friend has a few food allergies. Their gluten-free menu was a great help, but we had asked for her to be contacted by the restaurant beforehand to verify that she would be able to eat there. She didn't need anything crazy, just a confirmation that very simple things could be accommodated. Things that have been easily done by Red Robin and other chains. Easy stuff. They called her an hour before our reservation and spoke for about 30 minutes.She was assured that the waiter would be notified of her needs and that her requests could easily be honored. Great!

We get there and are seated right away (despite being a little late due to traffic) but our waiter knew nothing about the conversation that had taken place just 30 minutes before. He went to talk to the hostess and everyone played dumb all around. Despite her requests being quite simple and her efforts to be an easy customer, we were made to feel like a great big hassle to everyone. 

We split the raw yellowtail app and they messed up hers but quickly fixed it. It was so delicious though incredibly tiny even if we hadn't split the portion! There was a long delay for our entrees and the chef sent out a free salad during the wait. They also messed that up but fixed it. My friend had the black cod and I had the short rib angolotti. The cod was again a very small portion. The angolotti was a generous portion, especially given the richness. It was very good but we felt it overpriced for portion and quality, even for Vegas.

I had asked for my remaining angolotti (about 2/3 of my serving, so a large amount) to be boxed up to take with me and not 5 seconds after the waiter had acknowledged my request, he stacked a bunch of plates on top of my plate and walked off, thus ruining my leftovers. I watched him to make sure he wouldn't unstack the plates and scrape off my food into a box. Luckily he did not. My annoyance was high and we had a show to attend so I decided to not make a fuss and just let it go.

My friend and I have eaten out many times at many different types of places with a variety of price points. This was the worst in terms of service at this type of restaurant. The food was ok. Maybe it was an off night, who knows. I wouldn't waste my time or money here again when we come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"We went in after a show ONLY to try the duck and foie gras ravioli. We intended to sit at the bar because we thought there would be a wait at 9 on a Friday night, but they were able to seat us. The house bread basket was amazing. Three different types of bread with a paired dipping sauce. Along with the ravioli we ordered the scallops. Both were delicious. We had just tried the foie gras ravioli at Craft Steakhouse, and I think I prefer the filling there. But, the pasta here is so fresh and amazing. The scallops were on point as well! I would love to come back and try a full dinner here. The service was amazing as well, the server did not care that we were only there to try one dish."}
{"text":"Great view and there is such an attention to detail to their food items.  I was already in awe after the bread basket (it was definitely not an ordinary bread basket).  I enjoyed the Caesar salad and the foie gras and. Duck ravioli combo (tasty...devilishly rich)...the salted caramel budino provided a nice sweetness to balance out the savory meal."}
{"text":"Food was INCREDIBLE. We ordered the Lardon Wrapped Prawns and  it came on a bed of lentils that blew my mind. My husband had the pork chop which was definitely the best we've ever had. I ordered the short rib agnolotti which was beautifully prepared. The service was cold and rushed which absolutely ruined our overall experience. Although it seemed to probably resemble how it really is in Italy. Get in, get out, and good day. I would have really valued a \"spiel\" of the menu and the restaurant and maybe some suggestions. Not just \"are you ready to order?\" There are too many restaurants in Vegas to enjoy for me to ever return to this location."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are avid Chopped fans and Scott Conant is our favorite judge so it was only right to come here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday :) 

To start off the meal they brought out some bread with different dipping sauces/spreads... before even ordering we scarfed down the whole basket. It was seriously the best bread ever. Even after we finished our entire meal we wanted more! 

We ordered the braised short ribs of beef with vegetable and farro risotto as an appetizer and for our entrees we ordered the spaghetti and short rib agnolotti. The spaghetti was fresh and the sauce had a good basil kick to it. But our favorite of the night had to be the short rib agnolotti! The horseradish sauce was amazing and worked so perfectly with the agnolotti--it was like eating juicy prime rib in the form of pasta!"}
{"text":"This is seriously one of my favorite restaurants in all of Las Vegas Nevada you need to call and make a reservation ask for a seat by the window it is delicious I'm talking about the food and the view you can watch the Bellagio fountain shoot off from sitting inside your cozy swank seat and when you're all done then go walk on over to the chandelier bar and get a cocktail or walk over to secret and get a beer and a slice of pizza....Instead of dessert ...."}
{"text":"Not your typical Italian. I'd call it fancy Italian versus traditional/family Italian. It was good. I had the noodles that are made from squid. Good but next time I will probably go in a different direction. It was good to try something new."}
{"text":"Amazing pasta!!! I had the PICI and it was delicious! Our waiter Luis was super nice, attentive, and talkative. I'm giving them a 4 since I can't give them a 4.5 because one of host at the front was very unwelcoming when checking in for reservations we had."}
{"text":"This cute, Italian restaurant is located at the Cosmopolitan. We came here for a friend's birthday dinner and had a great service. 

We got free bread (take full advantage) and it was delicious! They have a good options for their main entrees. Since I am a vegetarian, I was going to stick with the usual and get a salad. The waiter then told me they have a separate vegetarian menu which made even more happier. 

You can see the fountains at Bellagio from this restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and I dined here in Nov and ordered an array of dishes. I forgot our waiter's name but he was a tall slender gentleman w. a beautiful smile. His service was very memorable. He was knowledgeable w. the menu and I ordered one of his recommendations;

Creamy polenta: CREAMY and RICH!

Sicilian-spiced duck breast with preserved orange, root vegetables and caramelized endive. I was pleasantly surprised. 

Duck & Foie gras ravioli- RICH RICH RICH and flavorful. 

Mediterranean Orata- Very light and flavorful. The fish skin was crispy and the meat was moist.

The dinner was good but it was the desserts that made it great!

The Strawberry Souffle and it was DELISH!! -I wish I could remember the name of the other desserts because they were all really out of this world too. 

The dinner was ok but hats off to the pastry chef and our fantastic waiter!"}
{"text":"Great price point if you're looking for something fancy that won't break the wallet. Plus, it's in the beautiful Cosmopolitan, with all its glitz and glamour :) The restaurant itself is on the top floor with all the other eateries, including STK, Jaleo, Secret Pizza, etc.

As for the food, we had mixed reviews at our table. I had the duck and foie gras ravioli which was a nice light dish. Had a hint of sourness that I'm assuming was from the marsala reduction? I actually enjoyed my friend's short rib agnolotti much better. It had great flavors, the pasta was perfect, where the entire meal would have a nice texture to it and then suddenly melt into short rib goodness. The tagliatelle was OK, not a particular favorite.

Overall, the ambiance was excellent. A bit on the dimmer side with their vintage lights. They had many private booths, creating an intimate setting."}
{"text":"My husband and I felt like some of the famous spagetti that we so enjoyed at the Beverly Hills(Montage) Scarpetta. What a bummer. Our service was extremely slow and just lacking in every way. It was still early by Vegas standards (730) so I don't really get the lack of attentiveness. We ordered wine which did not come until AFTER our first course. Finally our spagetti comes....oh, so SALTY...it tasted nothing like the last time. Our server must have known something was amiss as he never once asked how we were enjoying our meal. We also waited a good 45 minutes to be offered dessert---or the check by this time. We finally had to wave someone down to get the bill since we were DONE with this place.

Such a shame. We have had many great food adventures in Vegas, this evening was not one of them. If you really want to have some spagetti that will change your life then come out out to California and enjoy the Scarpetta at the Montage."}
{"text":"With so many cooking competition shows out there, I've always been curious how good some of these renowned chefs and judges really are.  Certain guys clearly have the cred to back it up, but there are others I'm not as familiar with.  Chopped's Scott Conant was one of the latter, but I can now say, without a hint of doubt, that...

SCOTT CONANT IS BAD ASS.

Although it may not have been the original Scarpetta in NY, my meal at this location was still pretty fantastic.  I'd even say they rank as one of my all around favorite restaurants, along with The Spence in Atlanta and State Bird Provisions in San Francisco.  Honestly, everything we had was terrific.  It's also easy now to see why Scott Conant is so tough on contestants who dare to cook pasta on the show - Scarpetta's ranks as the best I've had thus far!

-- BREAD BASKET...Complimentary
(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#hYFt6DlCGHA332ECJChzLQ)
Not normally something I would bother mentioning because bread is bread.  That is, unless it's got salami baked into it.  Well played Scott Conant, well played.

-- ROASTED DIVER SCALLOPS with Morels, Sugar Snap, Watermelon Radish and Pea Froth...$23
(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#V_vEStj9d5Uur3sAloUvZA)
My friend and I split an order and our server was kind enough to have it plated separately for us.  The scallop had a near perfect sear (could have been harder) and the center couldn't have been cooked any better - soft and tender.  The pea froth complemented the scallop's sweetness quite well.

-- DUCK FOIE GRAS RAVIOLI with a Marsala Reduction...$27
(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#rJ2lg-UKLTLOss3CPgcrYQ)
Simply fantastic.  I was already dead set on ordering this, but it was nice to find out it was one of their signature dishes.  The ravioli was amazing - silky and tender with just the right bite.  Although the foie gras filling was awesome on its own, the marsala reduction made it that much better!

-- SHORT RIB AGNOLOTTI with Brown Butter, Horseradish, and Toasted Breadcrumbs...$26
(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#x9WaFDf-qarVghjn7g-iYA)
My friend ordered this one and it gave the ravioli a serious run for its money.  The pasta was just as good in this dish and the short rib added a nice bit of savoriness.  The breadcrumbs didn't do a ton for me, but it still tasted great.

-- STRAWBERRY SOUFFLÉ with a Rhubarb Compote and Vanilla Gelato...$11
(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#UUgJpj3_-6a9_rBmpTbrSA)
Not to gush like a little girl, but damn this was good!  I thought the compote and gelato would be too much sweetness, but the dish had just the right amount of sweetness and the soufflé had a perfect consistency.  I honestly don't know what else to say other than that YOU MUST GET THIS.

While the meal itself was amazing, I thought some of the hostesses could really use an attitude check.  For some reason, they seem to think they're better than everyone else and do very little to hide it.  It seems other Yelpers have left with the same impression, but at least our waiter Christian and the rest of the wait staff more than made up for it.

Beyond the food and service though, Scarpetta might be worth a trip just to take in the view!  The dining room area (not the bar section) has giant bay windows that face the Bellagio fountains and the strip (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#3OL0vvlkTy4YgBuGuBi7cw).  Unfortunate I was only there with a friend instead of a girlfriend though (sorry bud).  Scarpetta, I'll definitely be seeing you again during my next trip to Vegas.  And considering how often I seem to be there, it'll probably be a lot sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Yelp Fail. 

This was my girlfriend's first time in Las Vegas, so I wanted to bring her to an upscale place and have her try some food from supposedly exclusive restaurants in vegas. Based on the yelp reviews, and time availability, I chose Scarpetta. It was a major disappointment, and I felt so bad bringing her to this establishment. This was the first restaurant experience she had in Vegas and it was horrendous. 

Let me say that this review is based on three dishes that we had at Scarpetta. 

1. Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli (main course)
2. Short Rib Agnolotti (main course)
3. Roasted Diver Scallops (appetizer)

Ambiance:

The seating and view were great. We were the table almost next to the window where the Belagio water show was going on. There was a great view of the show. The lighting was also dim. It is definitely a nice place to bring a date.

Price:

Despite the $$$, the prices are not too outrageous for Las Vegas. The main course dishes were 25 and 26 dollars while the roasted scallops were 23 dollars. 

Service:

Service was horrible. We were there for over an hour. Our waiter checked up on us twice, once to bring more water and the second time to see if our food was ready. We waited for about 15-20 minutes to get our scallop appetizer. No apologies or more complementary bread. The wait for the food seemed the norm, as the tables next to us finished their food and were just making small talk while waiting for over 20 minutes. After we finished our scallops, we proceeded to wait another almost 30 minutes for our main course. Again, no apologies or further check ups. I ran out of water while waiting for our main course, during the appetizer, and did not get a refill until I had to ask for one (after the main course came). When we wanted to tell the waiter about the problems with our main courses, he and other waiters could not be found for about 20 minutes. We just sat there looking at each other and our plates (almost untouched). Simply horrible.

Food:

Scallops - these were actually very good. They were simple scallops that were fresh and cooked well. I would definitely get this again.

Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli - came out cold, tough, and very very very salty. We have had foie gras before, and this was well beyond what it was supposed to taste like. It left a bitter and salty taste in the mouth that could only be drowned out by eating the complimentary bread with their house tomato sauce. My girlfriend did not want to waste food so she tried to put the ravioli in her mouth followed by water as a chaser. She soon became sick and had to go to the bathroom. She only finished about 1/3 of the plate before I told her to stop. 

Short Rib Agnolotti - gross. The noodles were tough and cold. The sauce made the bread crumbs stick to the noodles and caused the noodles to stick together like one giant pasta. I had trouble eating one bite of it. After finally taking a bit, the food was bland and left an unpleasant aftertaste. It was one of the worst dishes I have had in a long time. I am usually not too picky with pasta, but this Agnolotti was inedible. The noodles were rubbery hard and the sauce was cold and crusted onto the noodles. The appearance did not help. The food looked like someone threw up on the plate. The sauce was black or very dark brown (could not tell because of the dim lighting), but the appearance made the food even less appetizing. 

Conclusion of the meal:

After about 20 minutes of the food being on the plate, almost completely untouched, the waiter came by to ask \"how was everything tasting.\" I told the waiter that the food was inedible and that it was probably the worst thing I've had in recent memory. The waiter's face was priceless. He did not seem shocked at all, rather, he just appeared to be apologetic. The waiter took the food off our table and asked if we wanted anything else. At this point, the restaurant was about to close and we did not want to wait another 30 minutes to get some inedible food. I told him to just give me the check so we can get out of there. They took the two dishes off our bill and our almost 2 hour meal came out to a whopping $23 (for the scallops). What a waste of time and appetite.

This trend of inedible food was not isolated to only our table table. While waiting for our food, the table behind us asked for the check and had two dishes that were inedible and left untouched as well. I did hear that the fish was decent from the table behind us, but that was the extent of praise Scarpetta's food received. 

Overall:

I felt the need to write a long rant about this place. This dinner was supposed to be a happy and memorable event for my girlfriend because it was her very first dinner in vegas. Instead, it was only memorable because of how bad the restaurant service and food were. Considering there are a ton of great great places in vegas, I would highly advise anyone to pass on Scarpetta."}
{"text":"Exceptional service and a fab decor. The food.....yummy but I'm not rushing back. With all the amazing restaurants here there are others I'd rather go back to. The spaghetti with marinara sauce is what the chef is known for....now that I'd have a second helping of. All the rest was really good but not memorable since I can't even recall exactly what it was."}
{"text":"Snobby LA foodie here: this place is romantic, but like almost anything in Vegas, it's more about the experience than the quality. 
Food was nice, standard Italian. I know plenty of mom and pop places that outdo this restaurant by a mile, but they don't have the view of the the fountains at Bellagio :) (if you make a reservation, ask for a table by the window- it really is beautiful).
Also, the prices are adequate! And my lemon drop was very strong. Hooray, alcohol! 
Forgettable Italian food, but if you're trying to get in someone's pants (let's face it- who in Vegas isn't?), this is a sexy, dinner-was-fine place to go!"}
{"text":"I was tempted to give Scarpetta 3 stars but I really liked our server, the ambiance, the appetizer and table offerings.  I thought my pasta dish was just good.  Vegas is always pricy and I understand that but I guess I had hoped for a tiny bit better entree.  All in all a nice experience."}
{"text":"We had a very pleasant experience at Scarpetta on Monday night. 

The food was 5 star all the way in our minds, however our Service was a bit hit and miss. 

Luckily the support staff was really fantastic. The menu itself can be a bit intimidating so I looked to our server for advice, he briefly listed ingredients to me, not taste which is very important for me. 

Also one big thing we DID NOT LIKE, by any means, was not only being served from our right but from behind. During the course of service the staff kept reaching from behind in our booth which was not just annoying, but actually uncomfortable. We felt like school kids who were practically told to sit still. It was very odd.... 

The hits 
were the short rib app, and the gazpacho soup 

the foie gras and duck ravioli, which isn't as gamey as is sounds surprisingly and spaghetti was tremendous! :)"}
{"text":"While looking for a place to have dinner, I only needed to read 5 words to convince me to try this place out.  Those five magical words were \"duck and fois gras ravioli.\"  Umm...yes please!  So with little hesitation we called in for a reservation and I excitedly awaited dinner time.

Once we arrived at Scarpetta, we noticed that the decor was nice but not stuffy.  The people in the dining area seemed to be enjoying themselves and the view overlooking the Bellagio fountain just added to the overall ambiance of the restaurant.  The ambiance and decor definitely work well to add to the dining experience at this restaurant.

The service was also another thing that was nice and attentive but not overly intrusive.  They were very quick to take our drink orders and were quick to come back once they noticed we were ready to order.  They also did a great job of explaining all the complimentary breads and butters as well as fielding any other question we had.  

Now for the important part, the food.  Here's a quick break down of what we had:

Complimentary Bread:

Ordinarily I wouldn't even mention this.  I mean, there are some restaurants that give you some phenomenally good bread but here is the thing that puts Scarpetta above and beyond those other places.  The stromboli!  Holy moly this thing is good.  Bread baked around cheese and pepperoni (I think it was pepperoni) was just so good.  I honestly could have had this for dinner and I would've have been completely happy.

Appetizers:

Tuna Susci -   Assorted marinated veggies and preserved truffles wrapped in tuna.  I suppose this was the chef's interpretation of a sushi roll but I have to say that it just fell flat.  I mean with truffle and tuna in the mix I am still scratching my head as to how this couldn't be good, but it just wasn't.  It was bland and under-seasoned.  My recommendation, don't get it.

Beet Salad - Pretty much what you expect of a beet salad.  A great assortment of different beets with pumpkin seeds and stracciatella cheese with a balsamic dressing, it was refreshing and delicious.

Braised Short Ribs of Beef - This was by far my favorite appetizer.  The short rib was succulent and delicious.  Bedded on root veggies and risotto, this in a larger portion would make an amazing entree, let alone an outstanding appetizer.

Entree:

Indulge me for just a second while I draw a perverted metaphor.  If dinner were a porno, the bread was the nasty making out, the appetizers the foreplay, then the duck and fois gras ravioli would be the money shot.  Goodness sakes alive this is one delicious pasta.  A nice big plate of perfectly cooked ravioli with a drizzle of marsala reduction; these decadent little bites were heaven in tiny little pockets of pasta.  If you like duck and fois gras, this is a must!

Overall, I had a great meal here.  I thought the prices were reasonable for Vegas fine dining, the ambiance great, the service spot on, and the food was just phenomenal.  Honestly, if I hadn't gotten the tuna susci appetizer, this would have been just about the perfect meal, but even the susci couldn't dissuade me from giving Scarpetta a well deserved 5 stars.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Dined here with 4 other girls for my sis-in-law's bachelorette dinner this past weekend.

First and foremost our sever, Ricardo, was such a delight! He was just a super nice guy!

Bread basket was spot on. The eggplant spread is delicious and the salami & cheese bread was so salty and savoy and addicting!! Water glasses were continuously being refilled and service was top notch.

We ordered the tomahawk steak, 2 orders of the pici pasta w lobster, and the short rib agnolotti. All dishes were good but overall not as memorable as the bread. The flavor of the pici was nice and there was a lot of lobster meat which is plus but the pasta was a little too chewy for the group. The short rib was yummy, very rich. The tomahawk was a little too fatty for some of the girls in the group (Ricardo had warned us of fat marbling due to it being a ribeye). The real stars of the meal were the accompaniments of the tomahawk - the roasted on the vine tomatoes and the cheesy risotto balls! Both were excellent!!!

A cookie plate was delivered complimentary for the Bride-to-be. However we should have ordered a dessert because they all looked really good.

Decor is lovely and view of the Bellagio fountains is the primary reason i choose this restaurant."}
{"text":"Before eating at Scarpetta, my husband and I only knew of Scott Conant as the guy who judges Chopped, hosts that awful 24 hour Restaurant battle show, hates onions, and any dish where you mix fish with cheese.  He also likes to wear extremely tight unbuttoned shirts that makes him look like a distant cousin to the Czech brothers that Dan Aykroyd  and Steve Martin used to play on SNL in the 70s.  But for restaurant week 2011 we stopped by here, lured by the promise of $25 spaghetti so perfectly delicious, that it makes Jesus weep.  

Sadly, the spaghetti did not make anyone weep and did not live up to the hype.  In fact, my wonderful husband actually said that my marinara sauce that I routinely rip off from Mario Batali and Anne Burrell, is much better.  I personally was not a fan of the thick noodles, but I thought the sauce on Scott Conant's version was better than mine.  To each their own, really.  But yes I am slightly marking down my rating for the over-hyped food.

Other than that, most of the other dishes were just pretty good, but the  bread basket with the eggplant dip and the truffled mushroom polenta were absolutely spectacular.  Honestly, you could come here and only order the polenta and mooch off the bread basket, and you will have a pretty hearty and filling meal for a decent price.  

So I'm happy that Scott Conant's restaurant in Las Vegas was better than I thought it would be, but his Jesus spaghetti is just ok.

{"text":"Still may favorite restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip... Updated the photos to do the food better justice.  Everything is good, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Yet another really superb Las Vegas dining experience.  Scott Conant did not disappoint.  We came here shortly after the restaurant/hotel opened and even then, everything was done remarkably well.  Between our table we sampled a variety of menu items and we really enjoyed the meal.  I particularly loved the shortrib pasta and the striped bass.  The desserts here are also not to be missed-- specifically the chocolate cake with salted caramel gelato.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Having the spaghetti tomato basil here now and it just feels like I'm eating the Mona Lisa"}
{"text":"Never underestimate the power of spaghetti! Clean flavor not overshadowed by anything unwelcome.  Full body tomato basil sauce and impeccably crafted pasta so delicious you'll never look at spaghetti the same again. The rib cap was described as \"the best thing I've ever eaten\" by my husband. So, if you are unsure of what to order, the rib cap is a must. My sister has a severe gluten allergy and struggles to find any restaurant that not only understands the risk of cross contamination but offers an entire menu of gluten free options. She was she able to order gluten free pasta and said it was incredibly delicious. No easy feat when making any dish, let alone pasta ,for such an allergy. Not only is scarpetta accommodating and inviting but the dishes are made with unbelievable skill by chefs who are truly passionate about their craft. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Scarpetta features a very good ambiance with a fantastic view of the  Bellagio Fountains. To get a great view, make sure you ask to be seated by the window upon reservation. Ambience is dark, sexy and romantic, but different tables set different moods. They also have a booth section that is very secluded from the rest. 

Starting with the notable wine list, I decided to pair my dinner with a glass of Malbec.
Shortly after, our server brought us the bread basket. The bread basket consisted of foccacia, strombolli with warm meat and cheese, bread with herb, basic rolls and sourdough. Delicious!  They were served with mascarpone butter spread, citrus olive oil and eggplant spread.

Our server told us that they were best known for their spaghetti. Hmmm, must try that next time. For appetizer, we started with the raw yellowtail. 
For our entrees, we ordered the duck foie gras ravioli  and prime NY steak.
The yellowtail was very tender and refreshing. Used of rock salt gave it a unique after taste. I only wish there was more of it since it only came with 4 pieces. 
The duck and foie gras ravioli was alright.   I absolutely wanted to love this dish due to the presence of foie gras, but I could barely taste the foie gras. The marsala reduction was a delightful contrast to the ravioli. 
The steak was cooked to perfection. Medium rare, the way I like it. However, I can't say that it was the best I've ever had. Not even on my top three list.  It was served with seasonal vegetables such as carrots, tomatoes, roasted potatoes, wild mushrooms and parmigiano. We were told the  mushrooms were shitake , trumpet royale, beech, and pecorino mushroom. 

Since we were sharing everything, they were very accommodating by splitting everything for us.  The food timing was excellent! I wish I had more room for dessert but I was too full by the end of my meal.
Overall, i enjoyed my dining experience at Scarpetta."}
{"text":"A wonderful surprise at the Cosmo! We highly recommend asking the staff to course out th entire meal (serve one dish at a time). A single appetizer can be split into two portions so you can order a bunch of different plates and really take your time. 

The scallops with foie gras as well as the bone marrow and short rib pasta were our favorites. The pana cotta and mini doughnuts were awesome for dessert. 

Get a table by the window. The view of the Bellagio and the strip is stunning."}
{"text":"Came here when visiting the Cosmopolitan and we were not disappointed. There were four of us and we all shared our entrees and desserts.

Dishes:
Fois Gras and Duck pasta- ok but nothing special
Short Rib Pasta- good but again, nothing special
Spaghetti with tomato and basil- AMAZING, truly a signature dish, I wish I could have had 3 of these!
Octopus app- tasty but I've had better (mainly B&B also in Vegas)

Desserts:
Panna Cotta- I don't even love Coconut but this was AWESOME! fresh fruit yum
Strawberry shortcake- deconstructed and so so very delicious 
Nutella & Vanilla Bomboloni - AWESOME, highly recommended

The Spaghetti and desserts were the highlight of our meal. For Vegas, it wasn't a terribly expensive meal so we would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service. The scallop appetizer was amazing and the spaghetti is the best I've had."}
{"text":"We were majorly craving some good Italian food and decided to try this place, per the great reviews on Yelp. We got a bunch of different dishes and shared everything. The best thing on their menu was their spaghetti. While their portions are tiny, they are rich in flavor.The spaghetti did not have an overwhelming tomato paste, it was very creamy and had the right amount of sauce for the pasta. I got their filet as my main entree. The steak was cooked to my liking - just melted in my mouth.

The ambiance of the restaurant is very romantic.We had a great table right near the window where we could see the Bellagio fountains and the whole strip was right underneath us. The wait staff were great, my drink was refilled instantly, didn't even have to ask! I will be back here soon for sure!"}
{"text":"A beautiful place to have a romantic dinner. With no reservation, my boyfriend and I were able to sit down right away in a little cubby seating. It was adorable. 

For drinks, I started off with a Lemon Drop and he got a white wine. The apps are so good, beef tartare is our favorite, as well as the oysters. 

I came to this restaurant twice and got the spaghetti both times. I know, why would I get spaghetti in a place like this? Well, my first time here, I saw a yelp photo that quoted the spaghetti with meatballs as \"simply amazing.\" AND YES IT IS!! I love it so much, it really is just simply amazing. 

So in short, I will be back again and again. It seems like I'm always in Vegas... yum (to eat, not to party of course.)"}
{"text":"It's a fancy Italian style restaurant at the Cosmo. Of course, the service is phenomenal and the food was pretty good as well. The bread was delicious, especially the one with the salami in it. All the fixings that come with the bread was really good too. 

We got the Creamy Polenta, which was kind of like a mashed corn (i think), but it kinda had a mashed potato texture. The truffle mushrooms made it really delicious. We also got the Veal loin, which was really good. It was tender and not at all gamey tasting. It was very well seasoned and tasted delicious, especially since it was my first time having veal. I got the Stracci, which was pasta with lobster, crab, and shrimp on top. If you're a seafood lover, then you'll love this."}
{"text":"Scarpetta, located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, has roughly the same menu as its New York counterpart, including the famous Spaghetti with butter - er, basil - and you can expect the same eyebrow-raising prices.  But it's delicious and, besides, you're in Vegas so you clearly already hate money.  The atmosphere was relaxed, upscale and quiet, which may or may not be what you're looking for in a Vegas dinner.

The service is a bit of a different story.  On the one hand, there were periods when we couldn't get anyone's attention for minutes at a time.  On the other hand, our server was overattentive whenever he was at our table.  For instance, when we were ordering, after we placed our order he would offer commentary on each dish.  This might just be a pet peeve of mine, but if I've already decided on a dish, I don't need you to tell me that it \"appears small on the plate, but the filling and the reduction are actually quite rich, so I think you'll be satisfied.\"  Just say \"OK\" or nothing at all.

To start I ordered the yellowtail, which was incredible and I only wish there was more of it.  The sea salt was a really nice touch and I'm probably now going to be tempted to salt all of my sashimi going forward.

For my main, I had the duck and foie gras ravioli, which was similarly delicious (and enough food, I thought). According to our server, most people order three courses, but my group felt like two was enough."}
{"text":"We live in Las Vegas, and eat on the strip at least once a week.  We love all the Cosmo restaurants, and decided to try Scarpetta, as we had out of town guests, and we had been wanting to try.  We knew we would not be disappointed - boy were we wrong!   I really was on the edge on how to rate this restaurant, 2 or 3 stars, as the while the food was good, the service was awful.  The server was very friendly, however, and this is why I opted for 3.

First the positive.  The food was excellent.  All 6 of us in the party loved our food.  The desserts also were fabulous.   No complaint at all there.

The problem was the service.  The server was very friendly, but too many issues.  First, we got our cocktails, and after a few minutes, he took our order.  We did not order first courses, however our order was out virtually instantly.  We hadn't even half finished our drinks.  We had planned to order a couple of bottles of wine with dinner, however we never got the chance, and more importantly, our server never asked.

Worse yet, he came by a bit after we got our food,and while walking asked if everything was okay.  We said that it was, and before we could even asked for more drinks, he was gone.  2 of the 6 drinks at the table were totally empty, and he never asked, and still worse, he NEVER CAME BACK.  Our drinks sat empty for 75% of the dinner, and even when he ordered dessert, he did not ask if we wanted coffee or anything else to drink!!!!  It was almost unbelievable.

It's not like he was that busy, as I had a clear view of the waiter station, and he spent quite a bit of time just standing there, watching the dining room.  Obviously not our table, however.

Unless I start to hear some very positive reviews from friends, we will not be back."}
{"text":"As bad as DOCG was is as good as Scarpetta was. I learned my lesson....don't be cheap. It is worth the extra money to eat here for sure. I went here with a friend as our first meal on her first trip to Vegas. When you enter, the restaurant looks tiny... like a long hallway, and then when you get to the end it opens into a large restaurant with a big window overlooking the Bellagio fountains .... so cool. I was worried that I would need to order a lot to get full and spend a ton of money.... not the case. We both ended up ordering the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti and not only was it delicious but it was super filling. It was savory, had varying texture, and spiced perfectly... I loved every bite. That, in addition to their amazing bread basket (including 4 types of bread with some stuffed with cheese/meat/veg and 3 dips a whipped soft cheese spread, citrus olive oil, and eggplant), filled us up...awesome! We finished with the waiter recommended doughnut dessert.... I had one complaint about that dessert, either I missed it or they didn't tell us that one side of the plate was all nutella filled donuts and the other side was all vanilla... I thought the vanilla and nutella would be mixed...so when I was eating from one side and my friend was eating from the other side we were both confused where the other flavor was.... Anyway, the nutella donut with the banana gelato was awesome, the vanilla...not so much. That was a pretty minor problem. Our service was great and we each paid about 30$...not bad at all. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a mixed experience here: I really liked it, but he didn't. We came without reservations on a Saturday night, and the place was pretty empty. We were seated immediately and had a partial view of the Bellagio fountains. The tables felt a bit close together, and it was very easy to hear conversations at other tables and difficult to block them out. It was also extremely dark; so dark that the man next to me had to use the flashlight on his iPhone to see and pay his bill haha

For food, we clearly had the bread basket, which was a little large for two people but tasty. We probably left about two-thirds of it untouched for fear of getting full before our main courses. I ordered the duck and foie gras ravioli, which was excellent. It was tasty and fun and inventive, and I've never really had anything like it. The filling was salty (in a good way) and paired very well with the marsala reduction, which was a bit sweet. My husband ordered the veal chop parmigiano, which he was pretty underwhelmed by. He grew up in Germany eating tons of veal, and he said that the quality just wasn't there for the price. For dessert, we split the nutella and vanilla bombolinis, which are basically donuts, and boy, were they yummy! 

Service was pretty mediocre. While our server was perfectly friendly, he seemed really stressed. He had to run around to stay on top of things, and he sort of dropped/slammed our stuff onto the table and took off in a hurry."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. Beautiful restaurant in the Cosmo hotel with amazing views of the Bellagio fountain. The food was absolutely spectacular and I was so happy that they have a separate (though brief) vegetarian menu. They also have really great cocktails as well. Service is on point and quick. As others have noted, their mascarpone butter to spread on your bread is simply amazing. 

Bottom line, this has to be on your Las Vegas food trek. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"There's something about expensive dinner dates that stresses me out. What do you order that makes you #1 not seem like a greedy user or #2 not offend your date by ordering whatever is the absolute cheapest - like just a side of potatoes?

Well that was my dilemma prior to being taken here by Beau S. on 2/1/14 as his other suggestions for dinner secretly made me extremely uneasy, even though I wasn't footing the bill. While still not even remotely cheap, I breathed a sigh of relief knowing that I could order something under the 9 zillion dollar range on their menu. 

The restaurant is pretty but what stuck out to me is that there must be a thousand waiters standing around waiting to swoop in on any possible need you may have. 

Based on the amount of pictures on Yelp, I had the duck ravioli ($27) and I really enjoyed it. (I presume) to prove to me that he does in fact eat vegetables since we last dated, Beau ordered Brussels sprouts and spaghetti. He said the sprouts were terrible and he ended up not eating them. His spaghetti looked as if it came from a can. I declined his multiple offers to try some because it looked so bad and let him have some of mine. 

I'm not sure what the hype is over the bread basket. I had a good piece of French bread but it wasn't orgasmic like the other reviewers go on about.

Dinner lasted 36 whole minutes. We decided to have dessert elsewhere. The food was okay, the atmosphere was fine, but honestly, if I didn't have such a great dinner date, I probably would have forgotten I ate here. Who I was with was really the only draw about this place."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Scarpetta for awhile now! Decided to come here for dinner w my gf on a Wednesday night and it was not too busy. We shared everything and they split it all for us which was nice. The polenta with truffled mushrooms was Amazing I could have done without sharing this dish! The duck foie gras ravioli was rich and savory. The only dish was did not care for was the oratta which was a fish dish with a tomato based sauce. The fish was too fishy tasting for my liking and just overall lacked in flavor. The coconut panna cotta we got for dessert was delicious and I am still thinking about it! Definitely need to come back and try the spaghetti!"}
{"text":"-hostess could be friendlier...maybe b/c we changed the appt. time once?
-found a long twisted hair in the bread basket.  we didn't make a big deal nor did they...gross
-$35 cod wasn't really present.  smaller than a poker card and very salty/fishy
-food overall was just ok but definitely not worth the money.
-bill took a long time to come around 
-best: our waiter was cool"}
{"text":"Delicious fine Italian dining in Las Vegas at The Cosmopolitan hotel. Fresh baked bread is so yummy with the option  of vegetarian bread that is a must try! Their dipping spreads with the lemon infused olive oil and eggplant spread is so tasty! Definitely a must if you're in Vegas and want to splurge on a fancy and delicious dinner! Their pasta dishes are delicious as well. I ordered the tagliatelle with truffle sauce and guanciale - except I didn't have the guanciale because I'm vegetarian. :)"}
{"text":"Simply the best Pasta on the strip. I've had the privilege of trying pasta at many of the excellent restaurants on the strip and this is simply the best. The risotto is perfection so order it it's on the special menu."}
{"text":"HUGE FAN of 500 Cucina! We stumbled upon this place while searching for highly rated Italian restaurants in Calgary, needless to say we were very pleased with the results.

First, our service was exceptional! The server was an expert on the menu and gave us perfect recommendations on drinks and food. While they did not get our order correct initially, they were completely accepting of this fact and offered to correct the mistake immediately. The food was delicious and portions were plentiful!

Vibe here was fun- music selection was late 90's/early 2000's, certainly good for dates or even large groups. If I ever found myself back in the Calgary area, I would be back without a doubt."}
{"text":"There are so many options to think about at The Cosmopolitan when it comes to dining.  If you are thinking about a romantic dinner overlooking the Bellagio fountains, this the restaurant to choose.

Additionally when you go before Christmas the hotels all tend to put their restaurants on a rotation since it is slow season.  Scarpetta had been closed for 10 days until the night we went.  When I had made my reservations i mentioned it was my gal's birthday and would like a seat near the window.

We got there for our reservation and a table with 3 people showed up after us.  They were given a window seat.  We were given a table 3 rows away from the window and next to the waiter station.  We had a limited view of the Bellagio Fountains. The place is pretty dressy casual and there were a couple who had old jeans on sitting by the window.

We were limited on time as we were trying to catch a show at the Bellagio.  The one thing to note is that our waiter was attentive to that point and never pushed us on dessert, but did apologize a couple times for the slowness of the kitchen during the meal.

We ordered our drinks as well as our meal in one fell swoop. As we were in a rush at the night was young, we ordered the yellowtail and tuna susci with caviar for appetizers and  had the duck and foie gras ravioli and diver scallops with foie gras for main courses.  Everything came out slow and we were rushed!  We had two drinks before appetizers finally came and I knew something was wrong and didnt want to ruin the evening.

They brought out the yellowtail but then a full tin of Russian caviar with toast points...etc.  Fortunately we love caviar.  Unfortunately this was not going to be a simple $150 meal!!!  I did not want to and maybe should have said something but we had had a few drinks and I did nit want to ruin the special evening planned any more.  

The Duck and Foie gras ravioli was good but not as great as it sounds.  it was just too tempting to resist. I love duck and I love foie gras but I guess it didn't work well together for me.  The scallops were good too.  Now that California has lifted its ban on foie gras I can now more easily pass when I see it on menus.  The yellowtail appetizer was just okay as well.

Now the caviar was awesome but it is something I would rather have at a nice cocktail party and not on my own dime.  I am still wondering how that was put on my ticket because it was nowhere on any menus I saw.  My $19 dish turned into a $225 dish and my bill came to over $500 for two!  Ugh!!!

Yes it was a special night, but very costly!"}
{"text":"Brought a date here.... This is the right place to invite a girlfriend for dinner. The place was a little dim, Bellagio fountains view, candle lights...ohh my. Very romantic atmosphere. 
Our order was a short rib and bone marrow agnolotti and spaghetti with tomato and basil for my girlfriend. We took wine as well for our romantic evening. We took chocolate cake and cocktails for dessert. Cocktails were fantastic. I loved them, my girlfriend as well. 
Yes, we really enjoyed our evening.
The only reason I gave 4 stars is service . The waiter was slow, it took forever to 
get our meal and dessert was served by another server. 
I'll return to this place definitely and hope that their service will be improved by that time."}
{"text":"The food was ok but the food portion is very small.  An entree is about $35-$60 and a glass of wine is about $20.  Our waiter was rude when we asked to split the bill.  It's a fair request but his attitude and his response was short and rude.  I personally wouldn't consider going back to the restaurant nor recommend any friends to come here."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place.  Great food, excellent views, and one of the best wine lists I've ever seen.  Our waiter Johnathan was exceptional and the food was some of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"A meal at Scarpetta is a bit like a Chanel bag: you do know it is a tad overpriced for what you get but you keep on wanting more.

My girlfriends and I really like Scarpetta and ever since we went about 5 years ago, we try to go there at least once a year. We always rave about the dishes: this is really really good Italian. The duck and foie gras ravioli is definitely one of my faves but really all dishes I have tried from their menu have always been big hits.

The view on the Bellagio is obviously amazing and the service has always been good. The servers typically have good recommendations, not only for the food but they are happy to recommend cocktails and wines.

A good tip to save on some money is to go during happy hour (they call it social hour): they serve smaller portions of their dishes at a really good price.

I think it is a bit overpriced but when in Vegas... I always go back!"}
{"text":"UHHHH MAZZZZINGGGG!!! is it bad to say that the bread basket excites me so much? Everything was delicious! The veal and the duck were to die for but the presentation was really great to top it off... Did I mention the bread basket?"}
{"text":"We hosted our wedding reception dinner here after we got married in the Wedding Suite on the 36th floor. We had a four course meal with the scallops, braised short ribs, yellowtail, foie gras ravioli, spaghetti, Mediterranean Orata, black cod, NY steak, and a bunch of desserts. Our custom wedding cake with vanilla and chocolate marble cake with peanut buttercream was the most amazing cake I have ever had in my life (our guests said the same thing). It was well worth the price, as our guests kept raving about the food and how it was the best meal they ever had. We look forward to returning on our one-year anniversary!"}
{"text":"I booked our table on opentable.com and was thrilled to see we were sat at the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. We found the waitstaff to be friendly and knowledgable. My husband and I both ordered the tasting menu, with my husband enjoying the wines to go with his. The waiters did a wonderful job explaining each dish and spacing out the time between each course. We loved every course, but the one we cannot stop thinking about is the pasta with tomato sauce and basil. I know it sounds simple, but believe me it is simply delicious. I recommend having the tasting menu, but if you do not want to splurge then order the pasta, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Okay, so how good can basic tomato sauce spaghetti be? Well, that's what I ordered after being seated with my guest by the windows with a partial view of the Bellagio fountains. It was good. Actually, I'm craving it right now on the cab ride back home. The noodles are made in house and they were hearty with some chew. It wasn't the slippery Barilla spaghetti kind that you get everywhere else, even at many upscale Italian restaurants. The sauce was seasoned perfectly and you can taste the olive oil and tomatoes. More importantly, everything came out piping hot. The bread basket was filled with sourdough, cheese bread, and bread that was filled with Italian sausage and spinach. For dessert we got the chocolate soufflé, which was an it too runny for my taste. I'd opt for the tiramisu next time. 

The waiter was attentive and funny too."}
{"text":"Good: EVERYTHING!
Bad: NOTHING!

Swear this is the best food I have eaten in a VERY LONG TIME! 

The dinner breads were great and had a good variety. The pepperoni stromboli bread could've been a meal alone.

For appetizers we had the Braised Short Ribs, Raw Yellowtail, and Beet Salad. The short ribs were tender, flavorful, cooked perfectly, and had a good portion size. The yellowtail was fresh and so tasty with the pickeled red onion, LOVED IT! As for the beet salad, the best I have ever eaten. (Period).

Entrees included the signature spaghetti (I will perfect this at home!), Duck & Foie Gras ravioli, and the 24 oz Ribey. The spaghetti was perfect, amazing, simple, delicious, and awesome. Our ribeye was cooked and seasoned so well, I was glad to get the last piece! The Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli...heaven in your mouth with blessings from on high...I have never been so pleased and I spent the longest time enjoying this dish.

For Dessert, we had the Crispy Sweet Risotto Crepes. These were surprisingly good and the sorbet was AWESOME! Perfect way to end the meal.

I have been thinking about the Duck Foie Gras ravioli DAILY for the past 4 weeks, you have to try them."}
{"text":"This place was so yummy. And what a view! We got the tuna appetizer to start and it was so good. I got some sort of steak and I remember it being perfectly cooked. And the dessert was absolutely divine. I have eaten at some fine places, and this place was very, very good. Better than I expected!"}
{"text":"I would rate this restaurant higher if I could. The service is on point and the food is exceptional. The filet is the best I have ever had. And the signature spaghetti is even better the next day! Probably my favorite restaurant, perfect dining experience.  Beware.. You will crave it weeks to come."}
{"text":"Tomato basil pasta was out of this world! The bread basket had a vegetarian Stromboli that tasted amazing. My husband couldn't get enough of the eggplant caponata that comes with the bread!! The service was very  good!"}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best restaurants I've eaten at. I visit every time I am in Las Vegas. From the complimentary bread to the desserts, this place excels on all levels. Make sure you request a seat overlooking the Bellagio fountains. I have been served by Roberto twice. He is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Asato was our server. He was so helpful and nice. The pasta was out of this world. When I told him I wanted tiramisu for dessert...he went to a neighboring restaurant and got it...no that is service."}
{"text":"This restaurant, located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino is probably one of the nicest restaurants on the Vegas strip. It is quiet, fancy, and the wait staff is very professional. It is, a bit pricey, however. I think spaghetti with marinara sauce is something like $25. It is, however, probably the best spaghetti you'll eat! I had the broccoli rob ($11) and the potatoes ($11) and let me tell you...they were absolutely delicious! I can't describe the flavor because it was so perfect. While $22 for broccoli and potatoes seems a bit pricey, I think it was worth every penny. My mom had gluten free pasta in a marinara sauce and my dad had some sort of ravioli. They both said their meals were delicious as well."}
{"text":"We have eaten at scarpetta in Vegas 2 times and once at the Miami location.  After eating at the Vegas location the first time, we were so impressed and loved the food so much we chose it for the location of our rehearsal dinner.   

We had our wedding rehearsal dinner for 32 people at scarpetta in the Vino room on 6/15.  I'm so happy we did.  Everything was absolute perfection.  I have to give a shout out to the staff at Scarpetta especially Kelly Racine for all of her help.  She was fantastic throughout this process.   

We had a menu that consisted of the following

Braised Short ribs (Very good)
Creamy Pollenta (to die for)
Heirloom tomato salad

spaghetti (in no way over rated)
Short Rib Agnolotti (spectacular in every way)

Black Cod (did not have this for my entree, but it got good reviews)
Sirloin with gnocchi & wild mushrooms (delish!)

we also had two different desserts served to our table that were outstanding. 

The waitstaff was fantastic, very polite and moved around the room seamlessly.   I can not wait to return for another meal.   And if you're looking for a place to have a small wedding reception or rehearsal dinner, I highly recommend adding Scarpetta to your list of restaurants to check out."}
{"text":"Started off the year with a new restaurant! Decided to come here as a late birthday dinner. 

The Ambience is quite nice. I loved the lighting and the overall layout was quite lovely. Sitting next to the windows give you an incredible view of the Bellagio fountains. 

We started out with the steak tartar which was served with some parmesean chips. Delicious app that i woukd order again. Also tried that short rib on top of risotto. Really enjoyed this as well, but 180 degrees on flavor profile from tartar. So it depends what you want you want! 

The duck foie gras raviloi was 100% what you would expect. Delicate ravioli, generous filling, and a whole plate. I would eat this over and over. Also ordered the Uni pasta. This was such an interesting meal. If you enjoy seafood like i do, this will leave you wanting more. Essentially tasted like ocean. And i loved it. 

Coconut soufle was amazing. Pour over sauce and side of toasted coconut. 

I suppose my only real complaint was the wine. Typical vegas fashion the wine list was okay. And i found some bottles to be so over priced. $42 for a pour of 85' dows... Thats silly.  $98 dollars for a 15-25 bottle of poggio tesoro. I am a firm believer of bringing your own wine and just paying corkage in Vegas. Wine lists in vegas casinos are so awful nowadays. 

Id eat here again and just always bring my own wine. 2 bottle max, $35 corkage. Bubbles, extra bottle and youre set."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Went for my husbands birthday after New Years with a special request- seating with a view of the Bellagio Fountains, which they accommodated  The bread is amazing, yes, but don't fill up. While the dishes are moderate in size, very filling. Had the scallop appetizer: scallops melt in your mouth, perfectly cooked. Did not care for barley risotto on the short rib appetizer. The pici spaghetti was amazing, had a nice spicy kick to it and the spaghetti was cooked perfectly al dente. My husband had the filet, which just melted in your mouth, perfect! Overall great experience and we'll be returning for Valentine's Day :)"}
{"text":"I had been dying to try Scarpetta for about a year and we finally got around to it this weekend. You walk up to the bar area which is a skinny hallway that eventually opens up into a beautiful large room. We lucked out and got a table with a view of the Bellagio fountains. It was a really great view and so fun to watch. Our server greeted us right away and he had great suggestions and a good sense of humor, always a plus.  

We started with the complimentary bread basket and it was super fantastic, possibly my favorite bread basket on the strip! There is a delicious stromboli bread filled with warm meat and cheese. There is also an herb bread, a nice piece of crusty bread, and a little cloud like square pillow of bread. There are also 3 spreads, an eggplant, a mascarpone buttery spread, and a citrus olive oil. I am not a fan of eggplant in general so I didn't try that one but I couldn't decide which of the other 2 I liked more. So yummy!

I started with the Heirloom beet salad. There was an array of different colored beets, 2 little wedges of la tur cheese, a few micro-greens, and some hazelnuts sprinkled throughout the plate. Everyone together was great, I just wish there was a bit more acid to break up the savoriness of the dish. I could only stomach half of it before it just became too rich, luckily my husband was happy to eat the other half. 

I moved on to my entree, the short rib agnolotti. The pasta was so delicate and light. The horseradish brown butter had a little kick to it and overpowered the dish just a little. Again, I found this dish very savory and wasn't able to eat the entire plate. Again, my husband saved the day. 

My husband ordered the turbot, it was delicate and so delicious with a light and airy crust. The little parsnips hidden under the fish were my favorite part of the dish, so well done. We also got a side of the broccoli Rabe, which was good but nothing special. 

Our waiter talked us into dessert and we were so happy he did. We ordered the Nutella and vanilla creme Bombolini and can't recommend it enough. We received six little fried donuts filled with Nutella or vanilla creme with a yummy caramelized banana on the side. Everything worked so well together. It wasn't overly sweet, just a nice end to the meal. 

Overall, we had a great meal with a great view! I would definitely go back, if only for the bread basket."}
{"text":"SCARPETTA....OH HOW I TRY TO AVOID YOU!  Yes that was deserving of all cap's. 

So let me just take you back...oh say 5-6 years ago. I was living in NYC and somehow ended up at an \"italian restaurant\" with no sign (or a very small one) and had the best spaghetti...EVER. I was whisked away into the night without ever knowing the name of the restaurant/where it was (forgot, ugh).

Fast forward like oh... to a year ago when I had the pleasure of dining at Scarpetta here in Miami where I now live and A HA! I somehow had the same spaghetti that I had all those years ago. Immediately I'm like \"holy ___(insert adj here)____\" this is the best spaghetti...EVER and that was when my love/hate relationship with Scarpetta all began.

Love - in the sense that the food is heavenly and even after eating PASTA (carb overload), I yet still seem to be able to squeeze just a little bit extra onto my plate (whether it be dessert or what have you). It's not the type of pasta where you just peel over and die after because you just stuffed your stomach to maximum capacity. The flavors, heavenly. It's hard for me to justify paying for pasta. I feel like it's the absolute easiest dish to cook in the world (equivalent to a damn bowl of cereal) but at Scarpetta honestly, I would pay more. I stick with the regular spaghetti (trust me on this one).

Hate - in the sense that let's face it people...you're eating a plate full of carbs! Yes my body screams at me as I take every bite of the spaghetti...but it is like drug without the negative consequences (like oh say loosing your kids, family, job, and basically whole life). With this pasta, you just loose a few hours of your life while you are chained to a stair master all day to work it off. Believe me, if you haven't already figured this out by my review so far, let me break it down for you, it's worth it.

I suggested to my girlfriends that we all go to Scarpetta...
- they're all like \"well you're the elite girl so we have to go where you want to eat\" (and this is coming from girls who only eat like salads) and I'm like ok this is our food cheat weekend, remember? (girls vacation) and they're like \"mmmhm\" and so then I'm all like \"SURPRISE! It's pasta time\" Well of course one of the girls was like \"ohhh hell no\" and stuck with her healthy fish (arctic char) but my other girlfriend caved and had the spaghetti with me (muy bien). The friend who had the arctic char (it was her first time eating it but went with it because of the suggestion from our waiter) really enjoyed it. She said it was absolutely delicious. The spaghetti? I don't even need to say...you already KNOW.

We had wine and mimosa's and blahblahblah it was amazing.

ALSO, I am not sure if this will still be available but there was a tasting course menu which looked TO DIE FOR. However, the entire table needs to ALL order it (duh) so if you have a group of people possibly looking for a course-tasting meal, DEFINITELY CALL AHEAD and get their menu for it. The spaghetti is ON IT along with scallops and a bunch of other things all for a very reasonable price (compared to other course tasting meals like say at ohh... Le Cirque). 

Definitely try out Scarpetta. From start to finish, everything was perfect."}
{"text":"Great service, but the food was far below our expectations. 

The bread basket was great, my personal favorite was the salami infused slices. As far as the meals go, my date ordered the The Creamy Polenta as her appetizer and she seemed to enjoy it. 

I opted for the Short Rib Agnolotti as my main dish and the pasta was LOADED with raw minced horseradish which flat out overpowered the whole dish with almost every bite. And I LOVE spicy food, but it would took my breath away with almost every bite, so it was far too much for my liking. You would have to absolutely LOVE horseradish to even enjoy this dish. 

My date ordered The Risotto with vegetables from the Vegetarian menu which was just mixed diced vegetables. The dish came out at room temperature and did not taste good at all, so the order was sent back.

I will not be returning to Scarpetta, nor will I ever recommend it to anyone I know."}
{"text":"I came here with my dad, expecting a wonderful meal and that's what we received. We asked our waiter if he had any recommendations and he gave us some good choices to choose from. We ended up ordering the polenta with mushrooms as an appetizer. The polenta was creamy and the truffled mushrooms added great flavor and some texture. Then we ordered our main dishes. My dad ordered the black cod and he said he loved the dish. I ordered the veal shank and thought it was a great dish. It was cooked medium and tasted delicious. I wish there was more sauce on the veal rather than just the juices, but it was great. We also split the short rib pasta, which was decent. The pasta was fresh and made in house, which is always good. And the short rib was tasty, but after a few bites, the pasta kind of seemed redundant and too hefty. Following the main course, we ordered two desserts. We ordered the mini donuts with Nutella which were sweet and a bit of a mess. Then we had the gluten free, dairy free, chocolate ice cream parfait. It was extremely delicate, yet delicious. Overall, our experience was great and our waiter truly helped us choose some great dishes. I would come here again, next time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I debated giving this place one star due to the terrible customer service we received throughout the entire meal, but the quality of the food made me up my rating to two stars.

Everything we ate was really good, but the service was terrible.  We could never get the waiters attention for anything we needed.  Maybe it was because we were part of a big group, and the gratuity was included, but we had to flag someone down to order, we received the wrong dishes and drinks, charged us for a dessert for a birthday.  Who does that?"}
{"text":"Please skip this location and only go to the one in Miami, which is mind-blowing. 

Complimentary bread: best part of the meal, especially the eggplant spread

Octopus appetizer: fairly tasty, but the beans were too salty and thus inedible. The Miami version is perfection in a way that will make you year up, but this Vegas version just passed. 

Polenta: bland. But get this in Miami and you'll wonder why you can't eat it for every meal

Scallops: very good, cooked to perfection.

Duck and foie gras ravioli: So salty I could barely finish it. And I add salt to everything. The reduction was reduced too much, making the entire plate inedible but I was hungry."}
{"text":"I came to Scarpetta hoping to have my mind blown and that's exactly what happened. I made a reservation several weeks in advance because I wasn't honestly sure how hard it was to get in lol. I'd heard that some of the seating has a view of the Bellagio fountain so I was hoping that's where we would be seated. As soon as we arrived the hostess led us back and we were seated along the window with the beautiful view I'd hoped for. We ordered drinks and received the best bread basket I will probably ever have in my lifetime. It had a variety of different types of bread and served along side it was a citrus olive oil, whipped mascarpone butter and an eggplant tapenade. Next we had the beef tartare which was outstanding. I ordered the duck and foie gras ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the short rib agnolotti. They were both rich but had such depth of flavor. The pasta was tender and perfectly cooked. I could go on and on. We finished with espresso and the bomboloni which was so good. Normally I don't like banana flavored things but the gelato was delicious. The bomboloni were sorta like Italian beignets, light,  fluffy, and slightly crisp on the outside. The service throughout the meal was wonderful, the ambiance was relaxing and the food was perfect. Overall it was the type of meal I will remember for a really long time."}
{"text":"Being a huge fan of Scott Conant on Chopped, my wife and I made a point to visit Scarpetta as soon as we landed on Thursday night.  On the plane I joked that we better not get any sticky pasta, and luckily we didn't. 

The decor of the restaurant has a great feel and it's in a great location at the Cosmopolitan.

While the meal was fine, there was just no wow factor.  The black pasta with lobster was good, as was the veal chop, but it wasn't great.  

I am glad we tried Scarpetta, but there are too many great restaurants in Vegas to visit this place any time soon."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place doesn't have a higher rating. I think it's when people get things that aren't the pasta, which is the star and should really be the only thing on the menu.

The pasta is fantastic. We skipped all the starters and just shared 3 pastas because we couldn't decide: The duck & foie ravioli (amazing), seafood pici (super thick chewy noodles, delicious seafoody sauce and lobster, with a kick of spice) and short rib angolotti, which was the best thing we had. All the pastas were cooked properly al dente. We also had a side of broccoli rabe, which was garlicky and spicy.

Service was excellent. Interestingly, the interior was fancier than I expected. The interior pictures I saw on yelp and the website looked more young/hip - this is the bar area. The dining room is more formal.

Overall, loved this place."}
{"text":"Ehhh. It was ok, not omg good and not bad. The octopus was good  but not omg melts in ur mouth. I would get it if u really want octopus but I would skip it if you don't want appetizer. 

We got the yellowtail app too, it was good, again nothing you must have. 

Polenta was good, it was creamy and truffley, it's rich. I fee like I was eating buttery grits.

Pasta we got:

Pici- it was very interesting, tasted almost like black licorice. I wouldn't get it again.

Spaghetti with red sauce and basil- was super plain needed more basil and some fresh parmesan or something.... I wouldn't get Again really such a simple blah dish. Not sure why everyone is in awe of this dish

 Tagliolini- if you want to taste the garbage of the ocean get this dish, it was so terrible. It had so much potential but it tasted like you were eating the ocean and not in a good way. I told them it was terrible and they took it off. 

Short rib pasta- it was the best one, it was worth getting again, I wish the presentation was nicer, it looked like it was just thrown on there, kind of scant and random on the plate. 

This place is expensive but you're in Vegas so you can't be surprised everything is expensive. I don't think I would recommend this place based on food only. 

It's very stuffy in here, tables r very close to each other. 

Service was ok not amazing not terrible. I wasn't sure if our server was annoyed half the time or he just had a RBFace. The busser was nice."}
{"text":"This was a amazing experience, the heirloom tomato salad, agnolotti of Marrow, spaghetti was to die for! Service was impeccable, very stylish dining room, loved the leather place mats."}
{"text":"Scarpetta is an excellent restaurant, but it is also extremely overpriced. The portion sizes are very small and the prices are ridiculous.

I started my meal off with the roasted diver scallops. These are served with sunchokes, pinenuts, gremolata and mushrooms. Awesome appetizer...fresh and delicious.

For my main course, I ordered perigord black truffle tagliatelle. This truffle was definitely amazing, I was just disappointed in the quantity. They put literally three small shavings in my dish of plain pasta (no vegetables...nothing) and this cost $65. I understand that 1 oz of these truffles is $60-100, but at the same time they could have at least put 5 or 6 shavings. I thought this was a total rip-off. I mean this is black truffle, NOT even white truffle! I have been to other high-end restaurants where I pay the same price and they will literally shave a whole truffle into my pasta. Next time, I will boil my own plain pasta at home and order these truffles online. The cost will be the same but at least I will be getting what I pay for...VALUE!!

For dessert, I ended my meal with the amedei chocolate cake served with gelato and salted caramel sauce. Rich and luscious dessert to finish off the night.        
                      
I recommend checking out Scarpetta for dinner, just avoid ordering the black and white truffles and be sure to bring a full wallet!"}
{"text":"I am super disappointed on my expectations of this restaurant. First the service sucks!!! The guy who was taken care of us maybe talked to is no more than 5 minutes total. The food was good, bit nothing to really brag about. The restaurant was very pretty and we did have a great view of the Bellagio fountains. I would skip this place and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food was beautiful. Service was impeccable. Our server Garvin was very personable and quite attentive without being intrusive. The same can be said for his teammates (food runners, bussers, etc.). The only negative thing at all that I have to say is that no Negroni on earth should cost $15, but that's Vegas for ya, I suppose!

Pro tip: ask for a table with a view of the Bellagio fountains, if possible."}
{"text":"My wife and I took a group of friends here for dinner and the experience was unbelievable. The entire staff went above and beyond to ensure we had only the best time. The wine list was great and our sommelier made excellent choices. Our waiter and his colleagues made us feel at home. The food was tremendous, course after course we were impressed. We were seated at the chefs table which gave us a great view into the kitchen and unparalleled views of the strip. I would highly recommend to anyone, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great view and the restaurant is very cool..I loved wagu beef tartare and Mediterranean branzino fish was perfect"}
{"text":"Scarpetta's food was awesome. We were there for a buddy's 30th birthday party, and didnt want to involve ourselves in much other than enjoying our time. 

We asked the server to bring food for our group and let him know we trusted his recommendation, and it worked out perfectly as he knew the right mix of pastas to bring out to us so we could recharge our batteries for the night. 

We had a reservation and were in and out of the restaurant within an hour and a half- exactly what we needed with a 10:30pm dinner. Overall, this place comes highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great looking place, great sevice.  Food expensive and very small portions. 

If you're into this kind of place it's worth a try if you see something you like on the menu.  The food was ok, not awesome for the price.

Just not my way of paying through the nose and leaving hungry only to look at pizza slices served a few doors down."}
{"text":"We had a top notch dinner at Scarpetta while enjoying the wonderful view of the Bellagio water show. The fresh, warm bread basket with a delicious assortment was only a teaser of the wonderful meal to come. The service was excellent,  great detail.  Our wine choice-a Meursault  went very well with our meal.
For our appetizers:
TUNA 'SUSCI'
marinated vegetables & preserved truffles -never had fresher tuna, 
CREAMY POLENTA
fricassee of truffled mushrooms- just perfect, creamy and the fricassee was richly flavorful. 
Entrees:
MEDITERRANEAN BRANZINO
shrimp, clams, mussels & celery root - crispy and sophisticated yet simply delicious
SHORT RIB AGNOLOTTI
brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumbs- perfect 
Dessert:
STRAWBERRY SOUFFLE
rhubarb compote & vanilla gelato-so light and satisfying, absolutely no sharing of this dessert. 
My only disappointment was a side of the fingerling potatoes. They weren't bad but didn't live up to the level of the other dishes we had. 
We are pleased to learn that they have a Scarpetta in NYC. This restaurant warrants many more visits."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place more stars. Interested to see how this place was since well the show Chopped haha. 

Run down of us: came here for a bachelorette party dinner, don't be fooled us girls love to eat.

The atmosphere was nice and the drinks were good. It is kinda dressy so be prepared. The service was ok, and our particular server wasn't that attentive but I guess it was a busy night. 

On to the food we tried several dishes: 

1. braised short ribs

2. tagliatelle

3. duck and foie gras ravioli

4. short rib agnolotti

They were all decent, the pasta was good and the sauces were fine. I think my favorite was the duck and foie gras ravioli but it was super rich so I didn't eat much of it. I wanted to try more things but I was so full. Overall, it was a decent place and a good choice for a group dinner, but not sure if I would go there again."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there to celebrate our anniversary. Our table faced the Bellagio and were entertained by their fountains all night long. The service was extraordinary. We started with the polenta. Woooowwww! Amazing texture and flavor. Our second dish was short rib agnolotti. Spectacular horseradish sauce and the breadcrumbs add a very interesting and fun texture. For the main dish my wife ordered another agnolotti. This time it was the sheep milk with shaved summer truffles and Parmesan emulsion. This dish is nothing short of brilliant. I had a newly added dish. It was the Kobe Rib Cap. This was served beautifully med rare over homemade gnocchi, variety of mushrooms and with a Barolo reduction. This was probably the best bite I've ever had!!! We will definitely come back soon! Great experience."}
{"text":"Hands down the best italian food I have ever had. We came in completely underdressed with kids but everyone was so kind to us. We ordered 7 dishes or so and they all were perfection. My favorite was the truffle risotto. If anyone asks me where to eat Italian in Vegas, I am definitely sending them here!"}
{"text":"Please do order the Sphagetti!  Absolutely one of the best ones I have ever tried. The ambiance was very classy I liked it. 

However, the cheese bread is amazing!! Definitely want to come back and try the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Scarpetta serves the best bread basket I have ever seen. And I don't say that lightly.

I would've been happy with either the fluffy dinner rolls, the buttery, toasted focaccia, or the simple, crusty Italian bread on their own. And any one of the citrus-infused olive oil, the eggplant caponata or the marscopone butter accompaniments would have been not only generous, but irresistibly delicious.

Surprisingly, Scarpetta lays every one of these items in front of you in a sumptuous, complimentary carby feast, along with the absolute kicker: STROMBOLI. That's meaty, cheesey bread, people; it's a meal in itself, and a damn good one. 

I knew I shouldn't, but I couldn't help but stuff my face with the free delights. And although I was already full when they arrived, I forced myself to choke down the simple, perfect spaghetti, as well as a beautifully rare aged sirloin in a Barolo reduction.

I might not have any friends and/or social skills, and later that evening, I may or may not have lost my pants* downstairs playing craps...but eating this flawless meal means I'm a winner anyway.
__________

*I think The Bellagio is now in possession of my shirt. Now I've got nothing."}
{"text":"Scarpetta is good, really good.  We came here with a group of 4 dudes. In addition to the two usual characters, Mr. Booth and Mr. Bloewen, there was also Mr. Buxton.  While in Vegas for the weekend, we thought we would try out Scarpetta for our \"fancy dancy meal\".  Two of us ordered the famous Spaghetti, Mr, Buxton ordered the Foie Gras Ravioli, and Mr. Bloewen ordered the Linguini.  

The Spaghetti had a lot of hype, but I can clearly say it was the best Spaghetti that I have ever had.  Was it worth ~$28?  Probably not.  The Foie Gras Ravioli, on the other hand, was something unique, and as Larry David would say, Prettay Prettay Prettay Prettay Good.  As Mr. Buxton was eating it, he just kept saying, \"Wow. This is unreal.\"  He had to constantly put his fork down as he was enjoying the dish so much.

I was also lucky enough to try the Linguini dish.  It was also very very good.  Great flavors and cooked to perfection.  The only problem was the Mr. Bloewen had a bit too much to drink prior to dinner, and was not able to finish the meal (basically committing a crime). The rest of us got too full to help him out, but it should be no knock to the dish.

We also enjoyed a couple $16 dirty martinis (clearly overpriced), and had an overall great dinner.

Why 4 stars and not 5, you ask?
Well, I felt as though service was a bit snooty, and the spaghetti was good, but clearly overpriced.  I was not sure why our waiter was looking down at us, and not very friendly.  If it was not for that, Scarpetta would have clearly gotten 5 stars, as it did meet my high expectations.  Next time my wife and I want a nice night out, Scarpetta would be a good choice."}
{"text":"Really, yelp needs to allow for 1/2 stars, because Scarpetta is definitely a solid 5 stars, but Hubby wanted to knock off a 1/2 star for overly spicy Lobster Pici.

Easily one of the best meals we've had in Vegas.  Came here with another couple, and we each ordered a different dish.  Had polenta w/ truffled mushrooms, and salad w/ burrata and roasted beets to start.  We wanted to lick the polenta bowl when we finished, it was that good.  The beets were tasty, too, but the Polenta.... Molto Bene!!

Lobster Pici -- fantastic, but the chili pesto was a bit overpowering (Hubby burst into a sweat within the first bite).
Short Rib & Bone Marrow agnolotti -- Rich, luscious, and not exactly heart healthy, but oh my god good.
Raviolini w/ ricotta and truffle -- not on the online menu.  Super tasty, and you'll want to have extra bread on your table to sop up every last drop of the sauce (hence the name, Scarpetta!).
Veal tortellini -- one of the special dishes offered that night, easily the best pasta we had.  With shaved baby carrots on top, each bite was perfectly savory w/ a touch of sweetness.

For dessert, we ordered the Amedei chocolate cake and pumpkin soufflé.  About 15 minutes later, our waiter (\"hot as hell\" Luis) appeared sheepishly at our table to apologize profusely that the soufflé were not meeting the expectations of the kitchen so they were in the process of starting a new batch.  Which would take an hour.  :( While our friends were disappointed, we did give serious props to the kitchen for not serving sub-par food.  So we ordered the Bomboloni instead.  Which were \"the bomb!\"  One of the best parts of the meal, though, was the little surprise Luis presented us with at the end of our meal... to again apologize for the soufflé flop, he went next door to D.O.C.G. and got us a dish of the salted caramel budino.  Seriously, that was a little bit of heaven in a bowl (another 'wanna lick the bowl' moment).  Luis and the rest of the staff were fantastic, and we felt like they bent over backwards to make sure we had a fantastic experience.

Oh yeah... and we had a great view of the Bellagio fountains while we ate.  We waddled out of there fat 'n' happy, and found the pricing to be quite reasonable.  Especially for Vegas.  

We will be back to Scarpetta, without a doubt."}
{"text":"We choose Scarpetta for our 25th Anniversary dinner which we booked in early January with hopes of sitting by a window overlooking the Bellagio fountains but wound up to our disappointment sitting further back with a view of the building instead. But that was our only complaint. The food although not inexpensive was excellent. The fusion of flavors left you wanting more. We shared the burrata with beets, then the Short Rib with bone marrow Agnolotti. Both excellent and topped the night with a very creamy and light soufflé. They really know how to make espresso just like you get in Italy. Great service and delicious food made for a wonderful night."}
{"text":"I ate here last night and boyfriend and I decided on the tasting menu! It was about 6 different courses, each with amazing flavor. The bread basket and dippings that come with were so good I had to restrain myself from gobbling it all up too quickly. The cocktails were way better than expected too. I had the Scarpetta Cosmo since we were at the Cosmo. :)

I think our favorite course might have been the ravioli and spaghetti? No, wait, definitely the creamy polenta. GET THE POLENTA. And the starter of tuna and yellowtail was phenomenal. There was also cod served and duck breast, which were both perfectly cooked and seasoned, but I was getting so full at that point that I gave up midway through the duck. The ending dessert was a rich dark chocolate cake with gelato. They switched out the flavor of gelato for my boyfriend due to a nut allergy and were really accommodating. And they gave us some kind of pineapple cream in lava soup? That tasted like it came straight from Hawaii and the man doesn't even like bits of fruit in his food but helped me eat all of this one.

Everything was perfect! We left more full than we expected off of a tasting menu! Service was great and very informative."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to celebrate my wife and I's 1 year wedding anniversary and found this place through Yelp.  We thought it would be a good try because it's really hard to get a good reservation.  We ended up getting fit for a late dinner at 930pm.  

Nice romantic place that's dimly lit and if you're lucky you can get a seat next to the window which shows overlooks the bellagio water show.  

Service was excellent and the waiter gave us some good recommendations.  The waiter was so great that he even replaced my wife's drink that she didn't like.  We ended up getting the pici, duck and started with the truffled mushrooms.  All the dishes were great and very tasty.  Portion was just right where we got full enough to not get a food coma.  

One thing that would've given them the 5th star though would've been if they did something nice for our anniversary like a small cake, etc.  no biggie though.  Definitely recommend coming here for couples!!"}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect but we were quite pleasantly surprised!  The food was quite good but the entree portions were a little on the small size.  When my husband's fish arrived, I had to chuckle at how small the portion actually was.  The farmers market salad was quite generous and very fresh.  The creamy polenta and mushrooms were stellar.  The chocolate cake was luscious and worth the calories.

Our server did a good job however the sommelier was not up to par.  He did admit it was his first day on the job but when we looked through the wine list, he made no recommendations and never returned to see what we would like to order.  We did choose a wine on our own and placed the order with the waitress.

The ambiance is definitely NYC like.  In fact, we felt as if we were actually in NYC with the mood lighting and attractive decor.

I have already recommended this restaurant to my daughter and she has made a reservation for this coming weekend!"}
{"text":"the house spaghetti was so so bad. i would have paid $6 for it. it was plain and i can't believe that is their house specialty.

the foie gras ravioli was good. 

service was not so great."}
{"text":"We had such a gorgeous view of the bellagio fountains from where we sat. Initially we had to wait a little for our server but the service was great. The bread basket really is quite awesome. Love the duck and foie grois raviol and the squid pasta is a must. We didn't get to eat dessert because we were stuffed. Had dinner with my sister and this place was more like a couples place to eat...dark and romantic!"}
{"text":"We had an outstanding experience dining here. We sat at a window seat with a nice view of the Bellagio fountain show. 

The service was impeccable--we had to servers waiting on us. The food was delicious..everything from the bread basket to the main courses.The wine selection was broad. 

Definitely a place I want to return to next time I am back in Vegas."}
{"text":"a bachelorette party visit to scarpetta was by happenchance.  ok, i was wearing sky high heels and since there is no golf cart service to shuffle the ladies around...i canceled the she/morton rezzies for new ones at scarpetta which the group agreed to after checking out all the lovely shoes at the cosmopolitan!  

plus who doesn't want to dine in style with housemade pasta?

i think the folks here were trained at the school of Le Bernadin since they were on pointe with service.  you aren't supposed to notice how many interactions you actually have but they scored big.  i notice but i'm a foodie fanatic.

LOVED that they gave white napkins for white dresses and black napkins for dark dresses.  the ladies can attest to the lint nightmare.  

boo!: ask for a view! i failed to so we didn't have the bellagio view. (for next time).

bread:
insert triple toe curl for the bread selection and i'm not a gluten freak.  i would make out with the pastry chef just for the bread alone.

appetizers and entrees:
- the bride to be was in bliss with her veal duo.
- i loved my foie gras pasta - it was not salty like other yelpers have mentioned. and i'm sodium sensitive.
- every gal pretty much loved their dish from short rib to lobster pasta.
- the only mini ding was that the calamari was way too spicy for my liking.

wine list is lovely and affordable for vegas.  

we would have stayed longer for more foodie adventures but our  group had more stops to make that night.  scarpetta is a solid date night spot or whenever you want to be pampered.

tip: the lighting is kind on the eyes.  no botox required."}
{"text":"Ambiance is nice food is really good! They have s large selection of wines too! Portion sizes are really small."}
{"text":"ONE WORD: SPAGHETTI. No, FOUR WORDS: Tomato and Basil Spaghetti. 

Man, the spaghetti was out of this world. Never have I eaten spaghetti as good as Scarpetta's. Sure, it was just a simple dish but based on the flavor, the texture, and it's overall simplicity, it just exponentially made it better than any pasta dishes that I've ever had. And I'm definitely not exaggerating. But then again, I've never been to Italy.

Seriously though, if you come here, at least get this dish. You will not regret it. I promise. Oh, and the bread basket is excellent as well. Fight your friends and grab the piece of bread with the cured meats on it... it's fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is located at the Cosmopolitan with an amazing view of the Bellagio fountain. I was hesitant coming here at first because I'm not really into fancy Italian place.  

While waiting for our table to be ready, we had a couple drinks at the bar. They had a happy hour menu, and the drinks were solid and cheap. 

The waiter gave us a basket of bread and tomato paste and two kinds of olive oil to start us with. There was a variety of bread. My favorite was the roll with salami in it. They were all very fresh and delicious. It was even better when I ate them with my pasta. We ordered the Mediterranean Octopus ($21) for appetizer. They were very thoughtful and divided the portion in half on a separate plate. For the entree, we ordered the Spaghetti ($25) and Pici ($36). I wasn't expecting much for the pasta because I thought, \"I mean, how good could it be? It's just pasta.\" Oh boy, was I wrong! The Spaghetti was a simple dish, but the sauce was creamy and fresh. The Pici was hands down, the best pasta I've ever had! It was worth every penny. The pesto was so delicious and went really well with the lobster. The lobster was soft and tender. Both of the dishes were not overpowering with cheese or sauce, which I really liked. I think they also make their own noodles. They were very chewy - in a good way!

On top of the wonderful view and food, the waiter was really friendly and funny. He was very down-to-earth and honest about his recommendations. Scarletta was such a pleasant experience - I think the best restaurant I've been in Vegas! Cannot wait to come back here again."}

Now im a huge fan of Chef Scott conant and have had the honor the meet him at his beverly hills scarpetta location, so going to the LV location i would figure it would be the same excellent. First the service here is impeccable, the staff is on point and very knowledgeable of the menu. The atmosphere is amazing, very romantic for dates and great views on the Bellagio fountains. Now to the food... got the beef tar tar, squid and baby octopus and heir loom tomato salad to start; all were delicious, the beef tar tar was amazing with the egg yoke Mmmmm getting hungry writing this review. The heir loom tomato salad with baratta cheese oh my goodness, the flavors accentuate each other complimenting one another without overpowering one another. The squid and baby octopus was so flavorful, cooked to perfection; not chewy very tender. Now to the main course which is a big part of why my rating was so low, got the duck foie gras ravioli and the Fettuccine with lamb ragu and broccoli rab. I don't know what went wrong but my ravioli with the foie gras was so over whelming that it was hard to finish the plate, needs something to balance out the flavors. the pasta itself had no flavor (probably not salted) now to the fettuccine with lamb, which was well just fettuccine with lamb nothing special, not much flavor either and nothing special. Maybe its the location the waiter said scott doesn't come here often so maybe he needs to swing by and check up on this place but overall not impressed and ill stick to eating at the one in beverly hills"}
{"text":"Came for an early dinner before a show. Shared the tuna + avocado, braised short rib, and the cod. All the dishes were tasty. Cocktails were also on point. Almost as good as the LA location"}
{"text":"I recently visited the restaurant with my business clients and while my experience was 5 star, theirs was 3 so I am giving this restaurant a 4 star rating. My dishes were all great (personal favorite is the dessert: Panna cotta which was out of this world) but they ordered 2 pasta dishes and their pastas were all overcooked and displeased about it. I agree that if you go to a higher-end Italian restaurant you expect the pasta to be done right. The view of the fountains of the Bellagio was spectacular however. Overall, I recommend it."}
{"text":"AMAZING PASTA.  My mom says it's not as good as Italy but it is pretty dang close, and that's good enough for me.

PARKING: It's located in the Cosmo, third floor I believe at the corner near the restrooms, it's kind of small random entrance.  Free parking at all LV hotels and a quick walk from any of the hotels on the strip.

ATMOSPHERE: Dark, with a great view of the Bellagio water fountains.  Ask for a window seat if you're with a group of 2, if you have a bigger group you can still get pretty close but not right up to the window.  There were actually a lot of big groups that we saw and they have several private rooms for big parties like birthdays or celebrations, which I thought was cool.

FOOD: Had to get the spaghetti with tomato and basil.  It doesn't look like a lot in the pictures but when you  unravel the pasta, it's plenty for one person especially if you're going to be getting any appetizers or dessert.

BREAD BASKET - They give you all kinds of bread, sourdough, focaccia, stromboli (i think thats what its called with salami and cheese) and for those allergic to dairy, the foccacia is dairy free!!

CREAMY POLENTA - Sooo good, and I don't even like polenta!! It's creamy like mashed potatoes and so flavorful (prob a lot of butter) with the mushrooms it was perfect.

TUNA 'SUSCI' - Also VERY good, and very fresh! A tun roll but the tuna was wrapped around the outside, I dont remember what was inside but it was tasty.  

SPAGHETTI - So amazing.  They hand make it everyday and you can tell.  It was al dente and CHEWY, fresh!! And the sauce was delicious, light but flavorful and something that seemed so simple but blew me away.  Also for those allergic to dairy they can make it without butter and milk and my sister said it tasted just as good.  I tried a piece and it was good, but definitely not as flavorful as mine.  

AMEDEI CHOCOLATE CAKE - Your basic rich, chocolate cake with a slight runny inside.  It was a great way to end the night but by the end of it I was  completely stuffed.

Overall, a great place to try if you're looking for a fancy place in Vegas.  The pasta is like $26 and the atmosphere, although not the best I've ever had, is good and romantic for a date or a fancy dinner with the family.  Just make sure you get a good window seat!"}
{"text":"A great place with great food! Live music on the weekend which added to a fun evening, my only complaint would be the volume of the music. Oyster mushrooms are so so so good!  Currently one of my favourite nights out!"}
{"text":"What can I say...excellent food and service!  We were treated like royalty from start to finish!  We were a party of seven and fun but not an easy crowd!  They handled us with ease and professionalism.  We are locals and usually get excellent service because we are but they went above and beyond!

Everything was hot and delicious!  From the lamb down to the lobster fettuccine!"}
{"text":"OK folks, I'll make this brief. Go here.  Now. Seriously, if you're a foodie and are looking for primo Italian look no further. Bone marrow and short rib pasta? Bread basket from heaven? Best spaghetti ever? Yes yes and yes."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! Mark was able to provide such an incredible guide for us. We both started with a cocktail - he got the mule and I took the servers recommendation with the basil refresher. We both decided to eat vegetarian and the tomato basil spaghetti did not disappoint. I ordered the buratta salad. We shared the broccoli rabe. Everything was INCREDIBLE! We shared a bottle of Chianti, explained in depth by Mark, and was able to fully enjoy all bites of our food. We finished off with a Mango Marscapone cheesecake. Well done to the staff and management. This place was such a treat!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! A must try! Great food! 

My boyfriend and I had previously tried this restaurant. We had such a great experience the first time, so when he asked me \"where do you want to go for your birthday dinner?\" I quickly responded.... \"SCARPETTA!\" 
When we went for my birthday, it was such a lovely experience.  Our waiter was just amazing! He was so personable, and really made the overall experience pleasant! A great celebration!

For our food, we started with the roasted diver scallops, which just melted in your mouth, we then had the spaghetti, which is undeniably a must try item, the pasta is cooked to perfection and the taste is just simply amazing, after the spaghetti we then had the prime NY strip of beef, the meat was cooked perfectly!  And to top it all off, I had to order the mascarpone cheesecake.... after all- it was my birthday! This cheesecake was absolutely delicious, and topped with a magical mango pineapple compote and passion fruit! SO YUMMY!

This is a restaurant that you must try!  

-Ask for a table by the window when making your reservation, there is a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountain to enjoy!

(Sorry for the delay in my review/post- my birthday celebration dinner was back in April, and I have recommended this place to many people that I have met and know, and  I figured I finally need to put my great opinion out there to share!)"}

:::: THE FOOD ::::

* DUCK & FOIE GRAS RAVIOLI w/MARSALA REDUCTION
         - [4/5 - Extremely delicious and very rich. So rich, in fact, that while I loved the flavors.. I regretted ordering this dish all to myself. Next time, I'll be sure to order more than one entree that I can share with my dining companion(s).]
* STRACCI 
         - [4.5/5 - I hate to admit this, since the friend  who ordered this was obnoxiously picking on my order all night and insisting she had \"won\" as soon as she had the first bite of her dish... but her dish really was luscious. Creamy layers of flat pasta with lobster, crab, and shrimp. I planned to order it the next time I went to Scarpetta, but discovered today that it was unfortunately no longer on the menu.]

___________________________________

We also ordered an appetizer to share and a few desserts, and everything really was good. I remember all of us wiping our plates clean.

\"Scarpetta\" was aptly named. ;-)"}
{"text":"We went there for my husband's birthday last year and the food was pretty good! We had their house made pasta and wagyu steak. Delicious food but not out of this world. So slightly underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. The view is incredible and the food is equally as good as the Scarpetta in Miami. 

While eating you can enjoy the Bellagio water show. I ate fabulous pasta. However, we didn't have time to try some desserts."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Everything was delicious. Three stars because a friend that was with us has a garlic and shallot allergy and the chef refused to cook her anything. First time this has happened to us in such an upscale dining establishment. Truly  disappointing."}
{"text":"I had a great meal with excellent service. 

Food:
Bread basket was great!
We shared the polenta with mushrooms - so GOOD!
Cavatelli with wild boar ragú - hubby liked 
Short rib angliotti - really tasty 
Chocolate cake hubby said it's one of the best he's had - perfect temperature
Panettone - very good. 

Service was on point. We never needed anything. 

We'd definitely return. I'd like to try the regular tomato basil dish. 

The best part was meeting the owner, Scott Conant! Boy was I star-struck. He was very kind gracious to allow me to interrupt his meal. He offered to have his picture taken."}
{"text":"Not worth the price.
The food was fine but we had a much better meal (food and service) at Todd English at 1/2 the price and twice the wine."}
{"text":"I have NEVER had a restaurant cater to my needs the way this one did. I'm vegan and  I was with a large group of people. When I told the waiter, he informed the chef, who, in turn, made these vegan dishes that were great.

In addition, the people were very nice here.

Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"This review is for their Happy Hour only.

We arrived on a weekday around 6pm and the bar was pretty crowded but we were able to find a spot at the bar. All the cocktails and small plates they offer at Happy Hour were only $7, which was a steal. The shortrib agnolotti was absolutely delicious. Based on this dish I really want to come in for dinner some time soon. Perfectly seasoned and the texture was heavenly.  

The cocktails were great, too. Strong l, but not too strong and really great flavors. The bartender was really personable and we ended up having a really great Happy Hour. I'll be back soon for dinner."}
{"text":"We went there for my fathers 70th birthday celebration. It was beyond delicious! We had the creamy polenta for an appetizer and it was to die for! We could not get enough! Then we had the spaghetti with basil and it was the best spaghetti I have ever tasted in my life. The sauce was beyond. The service was amazing, as was the lighting and the ambiance. This is a must go to restaurant for all who are looking for an amazing supper."}
{"text":"I enjoyed everything I ordered!  From the Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti, which was flavorful and satisfying, to the delicious simplicity of the spaghetti. The staff was on point and very gracious. 

My dining experience was enjoyable, from the food to the staff, I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Scarpetta because I had read great reviews for the New York and Beverly HIlls locations. At best the food was uninteresting.

The first course was cold, the second course was barely warm (the pasta was dry as if it had been sitting around) and the third course was just warm but tasted awful. It was described to me as being a slow roasted baby goat.. sounded delicious. When it came, it was dry, tough and overly gamey. I usually love gamey meat, lamb, duck,etc... I sent it back, which I've only ever done twice before. The assistant manager came by to tell me that the goats they've been getting in are smaller than they should be and don't have enough fat on them. So why is this goat still on the menu?

I've eaten at some really great places  (Hatfield's, Eleven Madison, Lucques, Bouchon, ...) and am more than willing to spend money on a great meal. This is NOT in that category of restaurant. It's really lame to be charging those prices for such mediocre (at best) food."}
{"text":"My husband I ate at Scarpetta on a Friday night and were seated right away.  The service was great, the food was good and the atmosphere was great.  By far my favorite was the short rib pasta.  It had such great flavor and the pasta was perfect."}
{"text":"Best meal we had in Vegas, hands down and, if you check my other dining reviews from this trip, most all of them were 4 stars, mostly 5's.  My wife was really wanting to try Scott Conant's iconic and so simple spaghetti after seeing it on The Best Thing I Ever Ate once on Food Network.  We had done the Steakhouse thing already and were ready for some Italian anyway.  We are SOOOO glad we came to Scarpetta.  Every bit of the meal was fabulous from the stiff cocktails to the impeccable service and the just unbelievably tasty food.  Honey's spaghetti was all she could hope for and my Branzino was a masterpiece, perfectly seared, with the most delicious fish stock based sauce that was poured over it table side. My brother had a seared duck dish and my niece some pumpkin-based filled pasta dish.  Throw in that we had a fabulous view of the Bellagio fountains blasting every 15 minutes and just, wow!

To a person, we all agreed Scarpetta exceeded our expectations!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently celebrated our anniversary at Scarpetta and were seated by the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Very romantic. 

As much as I tried to save room for the main meal, the bread basket with an assortment of carbs along with mascarpone butter, roasted eggplant spread, and lemon infused olive oil was too hard to resist.  I even asked for a refill of the rosemary focaccia, it was that good. 

We ordered the following:
APPETIZER: 
*Roasted sea scallops- 2 perfectly cooked giant scallops that melt in your mouth. 

PASTA: 
*Duck and Fois Gras Ravioli in a marsala reduction
*Spaghetti with tomato and basil
Both dishes were fabulous and I highly recommend both.  I would easily order either dish upon my return visit. 

MEAT:
*Pancetta-wrapped veal loin- with sweetbreads and vegetables
*Halibut with vegetable puree
Again, both were delicious but if I were to come again, I would definitely order the Halibut over the veal loin.

DESSERT:
*Napoleon- creme brulee, macadamia tuilles, blood orange sorbet
*Chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce
Both were decadent, but I personally preferred the chocolate cake more mainly because the salted caramel sauce was divine.  If I could order just a bowl of salted caramel sauce, I would in a heartbeat. 

When you dine here, you will not be disappointed.  The servers are attentive and friendly.  The food is excellently prepared. I can't wait to come back and try other items."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Great view of the Bellagio fountains. I had a short ribs appetizer that was next level good, the entree was a pasta that was excellent and for dessert I had pastries stuffed with Nutella. Read that last sentence again. Even the bread is awesome."}
{"text":"\"This was a great meal\"


If you want food that is prepared to very high standards and is of utmost quality this is one great place to dine in Vegas. I had the beet salad, the pasta with tomatoes sauce (a must try), the branzino and the panna cotta. The beet salad was fresh and paired very well with the cheese they had in it. Scott Conant, the chef, is on TV always complaining about how everyone cooks their pasta and guess what? He has legs to stand on! His (well his chef's) was absolutely perfect!
The branzino was very good but not as memorable as the other dishes.

Since the the other dishes were so good, I decided that I could not leave without desert. I had the panna cotta which in my opinion is a must have while in Vegas. Even if you have dinner near by and want to stop in for a coffee and desert, have the panna cotta. Its out of this world and if I was not so full I would have had two!!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Scarpetta on Monday night.  I specifically wanted to check out the new Thompson Hotel including the Roof Top Lounge.  

This hotel and Scott Conant certainly have a lot of hype and the hype was, in my opinion, overrated.  The food was very good.  However, the service was eager but not at all smooth or in the league of the prices, menu, hype or the Thompson Hotel intention.  Staff were young and really were trying to be smooth, cool and hip but no where near any of those adjectives.  The sommelier had limited knowledge and was trying to impress but lacked depth or proper training.  

We ordered the Heirloom Salad with stracciatella and marinated eggplant first to share.  It was very good.  Balanced salt, beautiful presentation and the stracciatella was amazing.  We then had them split two pasta dishes to get a sample of each - Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli and the Pheasant Tortelli.  Very small portions but the flavours and textures were great.  They split each pasta and served them to each of us in a separate white porcelain covered dish.  Good creative touch.  

For dessert we ordered three cheeses and the Amadei Chocolate Cake.  The Chocolate Cake was amazing.  Likely the highlight of the evening.  We also paired it with a dessert sherry that complimented the chocolate and cheeses nicely.

Overall the room is good but not amazing.  They are trying to be hip and cool but the lighting and rough incongruent design elements make it a bit hard for my fussy eyes to handle.  The window LED lights were annoying and needed a glass shield to avoid a tan on the back of your head.  They might work for outside sidewalk walkers but not for a diner sitting at the window.  If the service was in line with the food and hype it would have gotten a 4 out of 5 rating.  Would not do a repeat anytime soon other than a cocktail in the roof top lounge in the summer.  The infinity pool was quite cool."}
