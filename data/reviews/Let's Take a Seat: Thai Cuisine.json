{"text":"I had a very mixed experience here, after hearing great things about it. Ambience is very nice but the play corner in the back is kind of weird, and distracting when kids are going crazy back there. I went with a party of 12, and had some major problems. The food took over an hour to come out, and they only picked up the pace when we complained about the food taking so long. When they did bring the food, some people's food were very undercooked, giving us the impression that they then rushed out the dishes without properly cooking them. My dish, pad see ewe with chicken, was delicious however.   The service itself was also very spotty, setting aside the long wait for food. We had to sometimes shout across the room for the server because she was not spotting us raising our hands to get her attention to get water, utensils, clear plates, etc.   Finally, as a group of 12, we wanted to do separate checks and made that clear at the beginning. However, only after some food was brought out did the waitress mention that they could only split a check into 3 pieces maximum. We didn't prefer this but said that's fine, if they split it by meals. However, they just took the whole check and split it evenly into three parts, making it difficult to know how much each person owed the three payers because some people got drinks, desserts, appetizers, etc.   I may give this restaurant another chance if I come with a smaller party because my food was good but the service was unexcusable. As far as I'm concerned, one more strike and they're out in my book. We ended up being there for 2.5 hours and that was just not acceptable."}
{"text":"Let me say right off that we got delivery, so I don't know anything about service or ambiance.  We ordered the Galangal soup and the Indian-Thai roti curry.  $4.50 Soup - This was only 8oz of soup. Probably enough to fill a mug. Extremely spicy even though we ordered it at spice level 2/medium.  $15.99 Roti curry - This was also pretty spicy-- I asked for spice level 0. The girl on the phone told me it'd be a little spicy because of the curry powder. Fine, but this was really hot. I would have changed my order if she had warned me about it.  Eating it the next day, it's mellowed and the taste is fine. Sort of soupy and contains non-standard curry veg like green beans. But again, portions were small, and \"Indian-Thai\" gimmick is ridiculous. It's the same as their green curry except they charge $3 more to give you bread instead of rice-- and we needed the rice to deal with the heat.  Total with delivery fee: $28. And we were still hungry.  If they lower prices or increase portions, I might consider going back, but only to the restaurant so I can stare at them until they can assure me it's not going to burn my face off."}
{"text":"Two friends and I ate here today. While servers were quick to fill our empty glasses/cups after we'd initially been served, we waited 10-15 minutes before being greeted by a server, and the wait for our food seemed quite long considering how empty the restaurant was.   My Pad Thai seemed way too sweet, and the tofu in it was in large rectangles--firm on the outside but soft on the inside--it was impossible to cut a piece in half with a fork and almost equally difficult once I got the knife I'd requested. I wound up giving up and pushing the tofu to the side of my plate.   One of my friends got a different (vegetarian) dish, and she said the vegetables were mushy.   I brought home Pad Kee Mao for my husband, and he said it was very good--he described it as being \"very light tasting.\"  Considering the price, I would've expected my Pad Thai to at least as satisfying as the much-cheaper Pad Thai available at the Y-Eatery on campus.   I don't have children, so I'm not interested in the children's area, but it appears to be a very nice space. The children who were in the restaurant while we were there seemed to enjoy that area and did so quietly."}
{"text":"The decor is neat, but there is really nothing special about the food. Fish is over-fried and too salty. The seashore appetizer platter is simply a plate of 10 pieces of cooked shrimps and fish balls directly from the supermarket, with one sauce that is also available from the supermarket. For $10, at least they can consider adding a few house-special sauces?  And last but not least, the rice is hard and half-cooked. It is not even a proper Thai jasmine rice!"}
{"text":"I live in the Seattle area, but I make a point of visiting Let's Take a Seat every time I visit my friends and family in Champaign!    I've tried several Thai places in and around Seattle, but the food at LTAS is simply the most delicious I've ever had.  My favorite dish is the pad kee maow with chicken!  The noodles have the *perfect* texture.  According to LTAS's Facebook page, they grind their chilis in-house, so the spice is always fresh and extra KICKY!  The spice levels go from 1 to 3, and I generally find that level 1 has plenty of zing.    The restaurant itself is bright, airy, and comfortable.  It was the perfect setting for my wedding luncheon.  Our guests had a wonderful time!  When I visit Champaign next month, I'll most certainly return to LTAS."}
{"text":"I ate at this strip-mall Thai place last night, and thought it was pretty good. The name of the place, as Lisa N. notes, is strange. \"Let's take a seat. Yes, let's. Okay, now we're sitting. Cool\" But whatever: keep Champaign weird! I had the \"mock duck basil\" and found it delish. The veggies were nice and fresh, and the sauce was well spiced. Yummy!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been there numerous times for lunch and dinner. The owner is a very nice host and have made us most welcome every time we have been there. I highly recommend the pad Thai and yellow curry as they are my wife and my favorite dishes there. LTAS is one of our favorite restaurants in the champaign Urbana area. We have been there many times over the past 2 years with our 5 year old and we have never had an issue taking her. The children's play area is really nice and she loves going as well. The food is excellent and the wait staff has always been very nice and helpful. Highly recommend you go and \"take a seat\" there."}
{"text":"Let's Take a Seat is not a typical Thai restaurant, if you couldn't already tell by the name.  If you are looking for super authentic Thai cuisine, I would say perhaps go somewhere else. But if you want to introduce someone less adventurous to Thai flavors, this is the place to go. You, the adventurous eater, will not be bored as they have a few fusion dishes that sound interesting.  A friend and I went there for lunch and ordered off the lunch menu. Bonus points for having a lunch menu with smaller portions and lower prices. I ordered the red curry chicken which was rich and tasty, a little too sweet for my personal taste, but still good.  The service was good but it took a little too long to get our change, not usually an issue but time is a factor when on one's lunch hour.  I would go back to LTAS for dinner and try one of their specialty or fusion dishes. Also, their dessert menu is not traditional Thai, but looks very tempting."}
{"text":"Let's Take a Seat provides a nice atmosphere with what I think is probably the best tasting Thai food in town.  However, the prices are high and portions small.  I regrettably admit that I left the restaurant still a bit hungry.  highlights: -great food -nice dining area -very friendly staff -small portion sizes -very small amount of rice, charged for more -on the expensive side"}
{"text":"Went here with my wife on a Saturday night on Illinois graduation weekend when our friends' birthday plans to eat at another restaurant went awry because the restaurant had gone out of business.  Our group of eight was seated immediately. Drink orders were taken quickly.  Others have mentioned that the children's play area in the corner seems out of place. I would agree. Otherwise, the atmosphere was pretty nice although the temperature was a bit cold.  Our appetizer was Crab Rangoon, which was just okay. The entrees, however, were outstanding! I had the Duck Basil and my wife had the Angel Fish. The duck was crispy and full of flavor and the sauce was as good as it gets. The vegetables were fresh and tasty. My wife, who in the past would rarely order fish, loved the sweet chili sauce that accompanied the fish. Portions were decent and appeared to be of good value. But ... regardless of price, I can't remember the last time we ate out when the entrees were this outstandingly good.  Service got a little slow as the meal progressed. It was very polite, however. The entrees came out at a strange pace. First three meals, then two more, than a long wait before the final three meals were brought out.  While the food was excellent, some of the other aspects of the visit keep me from giving the restaurant five stars. The credit card policy clearly needs to be examined.  Would I eat here again? The answer is a definite yes! My son, who is a true foodie, can't wait to go now that the old man has visited. However, we will both need to make sure we ask for a little heat with our order as we both like things more on the hot/spicy side."}
{"text":"Awesome Duck Basil and Angel Fish. Better than any Thai I've had in Chicago."}
{"text":"I had the mango curry shrimp, it was excellent. I enjoy spicy food, and LTAS prepares excellent dishes with interesting flavors. I wish the location were a little more convenient."}
{"text":"This will be a combined review - two visits. About a month ago I had the duck basil with spicy level 1 and it was fantastic. This past weekend I had the fish and was positive I had bad fish. I left a lot on my plate and am not a picky eater. Hopefully this place does not follow the practice or urban legends - or the truth - of the restaurant biz using old seafood on the spicy dishes hoping the flavor is masked."}
{"text":"I appreciate that Let's Take a Seat is the only restaurant I know in the Champaign-area (thus far) that dares  1) to be bold  2) twist the ingredients of traditional dishes to create \"signature\" dishes 3) caters to vegetarians with meat substitutes like seitan (which I enjoy even if I'm not vegetarian).  Location: Let's Take a Seat is located by Jupiter's Too. Unfortunately, it is quite far from where I live so I've only been there once. Free lot parking.  Ambiance: You can tell post-docs and professors go here based on the caliber of conversation (that may include criticizing students for being whiny). I find it pleasant, and generally pretty quiet. When I went in late August, there were ample tables, black chairs and gray carpet. Overall, it was a bit drab and dim for a Thai place. They also seem to have a mini stage which makes me wonder if this place offers, or its prior owners, offered karaoke. The lighting was a little dim for my taste too, but it is okay. It's decent for a romantic date.  Food: - It's rare to screw up thai iced tea so well-done. - I ordered the peanut egg foo young because it was such a unique concept. It is not the most favorite thing I have had in my life because I overdosed on the Thai peanut sauce. Think about it: two thick, juicy omelettes, soaked in super sweet thai peanut sauce. It was hard to get through one because it was so rich. However, it was worth trying and I do like this restaurant's boldness in trying new things. - Wait, they had dessert? And it looks as good as what the pictures show?! I have to go back...  Price: Expensive for the region but comparable to Chicago. The price reflects that this restaurant uses more ingredients in their dishes than other places you go to."}
{"text":"this restaurant has a weird name, but I enjoyed my meal there.  I'm writing this review because I'm hoping like heck that it doesn't go out of business.  I'm from california and this is the best Thai restaurant I've eaten at in Champaign by far.  I didn't find the portions to be small particularly, but I know that people in the midwest are often used to excessively large portions.  I had the basil chicken stir fry, which was outstanding. the cooks here are not afraid to use spice and it was delicious.  I agree with others, the appetizers are really good.  the noodles dishes were nice too, but the desserts were really outstanding.  We had a dish that we didn't finish, the shrimp, because we actually had had enough food and didn't want to bring hom leftovers.  They gave us our desserts free, which was nice.  It is on the pricey side but worth the quality ingredients.  The meat quality at some of our local ethnic restaurants is okay at best and inedible at worst.  It's just a function of the prices they charge, which are low. I'd rather pay a bit more and have it be good."}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice. All the dishes we've had were quite capable and more polished, both in preparation and presentation, than the other Thai places we've eaten in Champaign-Urbana. Really liked the mango-shrimp curry.   We ordered low and medium spice levels and got levels perhaps just a bit milder than expected, but well balanced.   Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I've been trying to eat more healthily lately, and LTAS is one of those places where I feel like I can treat myself and indulge while still staying on track with my nutritional goals. The Mock Duck had all sorts of fresh vegetables in it, was perfectly seasoned, and came to the table looking like a colorful work of art! It is pricier than the other Thai places in town, but it's not unreasonable, and I think that the food is really worth it. They have quite a variety and tons of vegetarian options, so it seems like it would be a good place to take a big group. The dining area is very clean and open, but a little on the sterile side. I think that as the place sticks around (and I hope it will!), the ambiance will gain more character."}
{"text":"Had the Green Curry Rice and it was great!  I saw someone posted it burned their face off, not sure about that, but the owner let us know it was spicy.  And let's be honest, it's Thai, who goes to get Thai and doesn't expect some spice.  My stand by there is the Pad Thai and the Red Curry!"}
{"text":"It has a nice, pleasant atmosphere. I had pad woon sen and it was good. However, for the price, I feel that I could have a dish that was as good at other Thai places around C-U. Might visit again if I was looking to eat at a place further away from campus."}
{"text":"I tried this place with my partner just about a month or so ago, and we've already been back quite a few times. Overall, I'm really impressed and it ranks up there with some of the best Thai places in town.  First of all, we tried the Lemongrass stick, which is a spring roll with a strong lemongrass flavor. They are, to put it mildly, amazing. Also, I'd say LTAS has the best crab rangoon in town. You know those tough, doughy things that are burnt to a crisp that you've had elsewhere? That have a load of cream cheese and nothing else? Well you'll forget about those as these delicate, crisp morsels melt in your mouth. And when I say melt I mean that pretty much literally. They are perfect little creations, and the flavoring of the cream cheese inside is very well done. On one occasion we tried the \"Heat Wave\" - a sampler platter, basically. Everything was good on there, though I must admit that the fish cubes were not to my liking. But that could just be that I don't particularly like a strong fish taste in anything.  For entrees, they have a very nice selection of different dishes to try. As well as the usual selections you'd expect at a Thai restaurant, they have an interesting fusion menu. The first visit I had the Peanut Egg Foo Yung, and loved it. The peanut sauce was pretty sweet, but I found it a nice compliment to the main dish. The egg was pretty much perfect. Delicate and creamy and not greasy at all. My partner had the pineapple duck curry. I had a bite, and as good as mine was I was almost jealous. On another visit I had the Himmapahn, which was a very good chicken dish with vegetables and cashew, though if I order it again I'd definitely order it spicier. The only dish I've not been 100% pleased with featured fried chicken pieces glazed in some sort of sauce. Sorry, I know that's vague but I can't for the life of me remember its name. It just felt a bit heavy and a little too salty for my tastes. I wasn't bad by any means, but the saltiness made it hard to eat very much. I did have the leftovers the next day, so I obviously didn't dislike it. [Edit: It was called Magma Chicken!]  The staff has always been very nice and welcoming. As far as ambiance, they seem like they are going for a little bit nicer setting than your typical Thai place (and the prices are a tiny bit on the higher side, but the ingredients seem fresh and they don't skimp on them so I don't mind), although I'd say this is undercut slightly by the play area in the corner. I have to say, I find the play area a tiny bit mysterious. It's nice on one hand, but a couple times we've gone the parents were making no effort to control their children at all. There's no reason why children can't play quietly. You may be used to your screaming child yelling endlessly while you eat, but it doesn't mean everyone in the restaurant should be. The staff were very nice about the play area to try and maintain a nice atmosphere for everyone as best they could.So, I'm a little torn. On one hand, if parents used it properly it'd be a great little help to them to keep the kids occupied while they enjoy a good meal. But I can also see it driving away couples or others who have no interest in dealing with squalling children. That being said, I wouldn't let that keep you from trying the place."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in champaign. Probably the best food in champaign. Wonderful restaurant, great atmosphere and outstanding service. I would eat here everyday if I could."}
{"text":"Being part thai and also going out to eat at numerous thai restaurants from San fran to Denver to Boston, I was surprised at the quality of the food here in especially being in Champaign. Their dishes have a different kick to them and although a little more than you want/expect to pay, it is well worth it. The decor and atmosphere is very modern, clean, nice. The owners are very nice and always attentive and remember you. I would recommend the basil chicken and pineapple fried rice= amazingness!!! My taste buds have never been so stunned. On the other hand the pad thai was average, but if you go here you should take a walk on the wild side and try something new on the menu! It is a very unique menu..this is a must-go."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place and went in since my niece is a vegetarian. As soon as we walked in we were happy to see an attractive decor but especially excited to see their cute play area for kids. My 2 yr old great niece was with us and she played happily in there through the entire meal. It's filled with big plush pillows and tons of stuffed animals. She loved it.  So we were able to enjoy our meal without worrying about entertaining her.  The food is excellent. Very fresh seafood, nice crisp veggies,  delicious sauces, and my niece loved her vegetarian dish.  We all enjoyed it and would recommend it for a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been there numerous times for lunch and dinner. The owner is a very nice host and have made us most welcome every time we have been there. I highly recommend the pad Thai and yellow curry as they are my wife and my favorite dishes there. LTAS is one of our favorite restaurants in the champaign Urbana area. We have been there many times over the past 2 years with our 5 year old and we have never had an issue taking her. The children's play area is really nice and she loves going as well. The food is excellent and the wait staff has always been very nice and helpful. Highly recommend you go and \"take a seat\" there."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place. The food is incredibly tasty (especially the desserts, most of which are American: cake, torte, etc.). I've had the octal soup, vegetable egg rolls, all the curries,  the sweet and sour, and several monthly specials. I usually bring half my portion home (duh, to leave room for dessert), but my husband can polish off a whole order of beef fried rice. As to the spiciness levels, my brother and I once ordered our dishes at a 2 out of 3, and hubby got a good laugh watching us blowing our noses and wiping our eyes during the meal; from then on I've stuck to 1 out of 3! The staff are nice, the restaurant is clean, and it is never crowded or loud when we go. My only complaint is that it is often too cold for my taste. I am constantly recommending this place when I go out to eat with friends, because I don't want them to go out of business!"}
{"text":"I love their pad thai and crab rangoon. In fact, it's all I've gotten from there but that's okay because they're both delicious! The portion on the pad thai is huge, so my husband and I usually split it. Also, it's pretty flavorful, which is what keeps me coming back! I feel like it's easy to get bland pad thai from restaurants. The prices are reasonable and the lady who works at the counter is friendly."}
{"text":"Such a pleasant lunch!  The service was wonderful, our food was tasty and we got a great deal with our WILL member card!  The food is prepared with no spice so if you like it hot, be sure to ask for it!  The salad that comes with the lunch specials is really skimpy but the miso soup is quite tasty!  The restaurant was clean and the decor, linens and china are nice.  The menu is LARGE, but pretty easy to read.  There are many sections and lots of options for each item so you can really choose exactly what you want!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time on Tuesday, so we went to the restaurant and wanted to look at the menu to get food to go.  A stout little lady popped out of the back kitchen and completely rushed us.  Had no suggestions and was rude.  We know what we want but we had heard that this place was a little pricey.   We ordered Pad Kee Mao, Basil Chicken, and Satay and it was nearly $40!!!! WTF! So we thought \"oh this better be good\".  Got home and took out food out of the bag and again said WTF!  WTF is this sh**?!  I have worked in a Thai restaurant and this is not authentic Thai food, WHAT-SO-EVER!  My basil chicken was ground chicken I am guessing - looked like hamburger but tasted like a turd.  I could've whipped up something better in my home - WITH REAL CHICKEN.  How CHEAP of them to use ground chicken and charge so much.  My bf's Pad Kee Mao looked like ramen noodles, and was not made with the wide, thick rice noodles and surely didn't taste like any Pad Kee Mao he had ever tasted, and he's Thai!    Don't waste your time or money to go here.  It is nothing but a rip off.  I can not believe they have been in business this long.  Should have drove across town to get Golden Wok.  Would have been have the price, authentic and tastes delicious!"}
{"text":"This place serves generic Asian food. I really can't qualify this as an authentic Thai restaurant. They have a little bit of everything but nothing really stands out for me. Service is quick, although I have never seen this place packed. The few times I've been there have always been very quiet. I do think the dishes are slightly over priced for what they are. My favorite on the menu is probably the red curry. I would not go out of my way to go to this place."}
{"text":"We've been back several times since my first review, and the owner has learned our spiciness tastes, so now we get it the way we like.  Again: best Thai in the C-U area, hands down!"}
{"text":"Went there with a couple of friends and what can I say? It was delicious!!! Had the 'Pad Kee Maow'--flat noodle dishes in spicy sauce with tofu and veggies in lieu of 'Pad Thai'--and it was delishhhh~~~ I like my Thai and Asian food *spicy* without the spiciness necessarily covering up the taste (or lack thereof). But this dish was both spicy and really flavorful. Would definitely go back to the restaurant for this dish alone or even have it as take-out. Also loved the peanut sauce that one of the salads came with. Forget about the peanut sauce that you get in bottles in Asian grocery stores. This was *homemade* and you can tell that it was homemade by the richness of the paste and, once again, its 'flavor-fulness' (is that a word?). Reminded me of really good home-made bean paste or red pepper paste that you get in Korean food. Plus, I loved the plates (a slightly lop-sided design) that made sliding the leftover Pad Kee Maow into enviro-friendly paper take-out boxes a cinch! Portions are generous which is good because some of the dishes are pricy for Champaign even though this particular dish was more than reasonable at $10.99.  If there was a minus to an otherwise fabulous meal--it would be the strong-flavored  fish sauce in one or two of the dishes (would definitely need to alert the customers)--but otherwise an excellent experience!!!"}
