{"text":"Truly a wonderful morning experience. Wandering in with still sleep in your eyes and memories of your bed you're greeted by a warm and inviting staff that are eager to please. 

The menu is full of variety offering traditional and expected breakfast items with many featuring fresh fruit and various options. The staff is very attentive and quick to see how you're doing and to refill that mug of coffee. 

Great food, terrific atmosphere and a great way to start a weekend of exploring the city or just heading back home and living on the couch and exploring all of those ignored books."}
{"text":"Solid brunch and breakfast place. Good variety of dishes that I have tried over the years. Especially love the fries/breakfast potatoes that come with many of the meals."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst brunch experience I have ever had. First the pre requisite 1/2 hour wait which is expected at most breakfast places in the city. My daughter and I then had about an hour before we needed to head out to an appointment. Should be more than enough time for eggs. After 25 min wait, we asked the waitress. Any minute she said, they are just finishing up. Another 10 min goes by and still nothing. Another 10 min (45 total) and we asked again. Same answer. Just finishing. 5 min later we told her this was ridiculous and we had to leave. They asked if we wanted it to go. An hour after sitting we ended up with eggs to go!! Had to eat in the car. And to add insult to injury, no discount on food and they gave us a smoothie for our troubles. Two people, one drink. Do the math! Will never go back."}
{"text":"Like home-cooked food, but better! Their omelettes taste like what I always imagine mine will taste like (but then don't). I get take-out from here almost every day I'm at work. The owner, hosts, servers, and even the cooks are always super-friendly. They're also really flexible about making substitutions or accommodating special requests."}
{"text":"poor food quality for the price. eggs benny had a cinnimon sauce ? my husband had two thin slices of peameal on his benny. totally obsurd for the price of fifty dollars for two people for breakfast. 
take a pass at boom."}
{"text":"We had to wait 15min to get a table for a table for four but we clearly just came at peak hour, it slowed down right after we sat down. Not a bad wait though!! Nice atmosphere good happy vibes. Nice and bright natural light. 

Food came in 15min and was DELISHISH and well priced! 

Totally would come back and recommend to friends"}
{"text":"This was our first Saturday whilst visiting Toronto so breakfast out was a must. No disappointment here. Boom was pretty busy (usually a good sign) but we didn't have to wait for a table and the food was great.

We had differing breakfasts from pancakes, to fruit to cooked breakfast. Service was very friendly and fast so definitely on the agenda to come back when we next revisit Toronto."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. Takeout is often a nightmare. Can't get through on the phone, and orders are messed up pretty regularly. Beware the patios in summer. Staff will seat you there on request and do little to warn you of the extent of their wasp infestations. Nothing like a literal wasp infestation to make your brunch special. Food, portions and prices are good. Service is terrible."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place for a 7am breakfast meeting in the neighbourhood and thought we would give this place a try.

The food was as expected, and actually on the better side - I had the California Spa-mlette, my colleague ordered the Banana Berry Pancakes and the other had the Tuscan something or other (I don't remember exactly what it was called). I would like to point out, that the food was NOT greasy at all, in fact I felt rather healthy after my breakfast. It was very fresh and quite flavourful. The thickness of my omelette was really nice.

We all had coffee and I must say there is nothing quite like bottomless morning coffee. It makes my hart go pitter patter (both literally and figuratively). 

The atmosphere was great, it was nice and quiet when we arrived, although by the time we left around 9 it had picked up and the conversation was harder to hear.

The prices are extremely reasonable, everything on the menu was like $10 - there was actually an entire second side which we hardly even looked at.

The service was also good, we arrived quite early and were seated by one of the chefs, who brought us coffee, while we waited for the server to come around. 

On a whole a very pleasant experience. I will be adding this place to our repertoire of morning breakfast spots!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with this place. I wish we looked at the menu before we went there. There are much better breakfast options in this neighbourhood. I usually like a bit of everything with my breakfast eggs, toast, bacon, home fries and a side pancake. 

I ordered the 2 eggs breakfast that came with toast, home fries, bacon and for some strange reason half of a canned tomato. 

The eggs were cooked well, my issue with the eggs is that there don't have pepper at the table. The server comes with a giant pepper mill when she brings your food. I enjoy adding pepper to my yolk as I eat my eggs. 

I had the rye toast, it was really thick, NOT toasted it was just warmed up and there was no butter on my giant warm slice of bread. Instead it came with 1 butter pack. 

The home fries were potato wedges, and they were fine. Except a wedge is a far cry from home fries. 

The bacon was 3 pieces skinnier than my finger, they were long but I've never seen bacon so skinny and thin. Also, it was cold and so greasy the grease started to turn into a solid on my plate as it cooled down. 

I would have loved to order a side pancake except it wasn't on the menu and I didn't bother when I saw real maple syrup was $2.50. 

I can't tell you what the canned tomato was like because it was cold and smelled disgusting I couldn't bring myself to try it. Why can't they just serve some fresh fruit on the side? 

My partner ordered the eggs Benedict, I didn't bother trying it expect for the hollandaise sauce which was disappointing. I can tell you he wasn't happy and doesn't want to go back either."}
{"text":"Terrific location just off subway line. Wonderful staff friendly. 
Gluten free(no corn) bread. Terrific omelettes and great service. 
Definite reccommend in and out, with a reasonable bill."}
{"text":"it's hit or miss....when it hits it's great...when it misses it ain't"}
{"text":"Come for the location and Hipster/yuppie crowd, not the food. The restaurant looks great, has a cool vibe, and lots of people seem to like going there, but the food is decidedly forgettable, and the service is slow. Smoothies arrived after the meal, and no water offered during the wait."}
{"text":"I like the ambiance there. Food was alright and i must have waited 30-45 min for my smoothie and eggs benny to arrive!! My criticism is that there was not enough hollandaise sauce and the eggs benedict was over cooked."}
{"text":"It is okay - not jaw dropping; ordered French Toast with Peameal, tomato juice and coffee.  Food is acceptable.   Server's name is Colleen.  She is nice and tries to accommodate my request for fruit (chopped cantaloupe).  She was attentive although when I was escorted to my table, cutlery was not set up even after the food was served. Had to ask for coffee refill.   I had to remind that I need cutlery to eat my food (*smile*).  

As someone who loves to eat out for breakfast and brunch, I appreciate establishment that has WIFI.  BOOM has WIFI as my iPAD had shown but establishment would not share to customers.  Tough for techy customers who are willing to spend money for food and access to WIFI.  I was alone and my bill was closed to $17.00.  

Highly likely I willl come back.  Thus far, best French Toast I have tasted is from Aroma and they have free WIFI for customers."}
{"text":"Great place for a nice somewhat healthy breakfast or late lunch. Our server was attentive and food tasted amazing!  Gf got the grilled cheese an asked for a pea meal bacon in the middle. Get it! Trust me!  Its awesome. Yes freshly squeaked drinks are kinda pricey at over 4 bucks but smoothies are super fresh. Waiter told us that they will be getting milk shake machine soon. So hello cool summer shakes. Walk able distance from Eglinton station.  Overall a good filling experience."}
{"text":"Great way to start off the day with a beautiful sunny side up ;) with the staffs!! Friendly outstanding service. Shout out to the waiter who was lovely, thoughtful and caring. He overheard my daughter mentioned it is my birthday today so he surprised me with a pancake cake and candles along with staffs singing the birthday song."}
{"text":"I went to the one close to Eglinton/Yonge for breakfast but it was hard to find a parking spot. The foods were okay but their potatoes are good."}
{"text":"We've now gone here a couple of times as it's nearby and quick....but definitely underwhelming. Not sure why It's rated so highly. The food is fine, but you'd have to be a complete nincompoop to screw up breakfast. So beyond fine, here's what was wrong with the food: we sub'd fruit into some of our orders, which meant one strawberry and a slice of something else. Go to Cora's and see what \"fruit\" means!  All our orders came with toast - which meant we each got one slice of toast. Here's an easy restaurant tip: a slice of toast costs like 15 cents. Spring for extra toast and your customers will leave way happier. For the price - totally not worth it. And if you sit in side in one of the booths, the low ceilings and dingy lighting make for a noisy uninspiring experience. Hey!  Why'd I even give this place a two. I guess i reserve one for places that actually make me sick."}
{"text":"I LOVE brunch! I looove BOOM!
one of the bestest chocolate chip pancakes! 
(next to my dad's Adzuki pancake, that is.)

so good! nuff said"}
{"text":"Came on a Thursday morning around 11 so it was pretty empty. The menu had a good selection of breakfast food and a little bit of pasta, salad and stuff like that. The pancakes were heavenly and the egg benedict was perfect. I'm so happy I found a brunch spot in my hood!!"}
{"text":"I have now been here twice, my first visit I enjoyed the food very much but the service was lacking (was overcharged and waiter messed up our order twice). It was still a nice enough visit to warrant going back.  Unfortunately my second visit will be my last thanks to the terrible attitude of the staff after having gone in unwittingly close to closing time (there were still 3 or 4 tables sat eating). The man that seated us made it clear we were unwelcome from the look he gave us when we walked in to seating us without even saying a word and then waving us over from across the restaurant in a way that made it clear we were wasting his time. We didn't even understand the reason for his attitude until he shot us another dirty look from the front door as he locked it. We didn't even stay to order, just paid for our coffees and left. People like that have no place in a service industry, if we had simply been told that the restaurant was closing we would have been more than happy to come again on another day instead we dealt with nothing but attitude. With service like that I won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Boom Breakfast and Co was a bust! I've wanted to try this place for awhile but sadly it did not live up to my expectations. 

My first impression when we walked in was the room seemed a bit crowded even though it was only half full. We had a very short wait but when the waiter came to ask how many was in our party, he went straight to the people BEHIND us. Thankfully, they were gracious enough to say we came before them. Needless to say, that settled if we'd ever come back again - NEVER! 

We were placed at a table for two by the cooking area. It's the worst place to sit in the restaurant because it's a high traffic area with the staff going back and forth to put in food orders and pick up food. We were not amused. We're they going out of thier way to ensure we wouldn't come back? Well, good job, they succeeded at meeting that goal. 

Now the food. I had a Father Gianni omelette and the hubby had the Power breakfast (eggs scrambled).  Both egg dishes were under cooked and soggy. They were also tasteless. The toast was barely toasted. The potatoes wedges were ok - they had the most flavour. The bacon was cooked as requested and that is the only food I enjoyed.  

In summary, we will not eat at this restaurant again. We will go to Dawn across the street, which is better in every aspect and we thoroughly enjoyed it when we went there a few weeks ago."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Three people and we ordered One egg omelette , another order of two eggs and one burrito. After 20 minutes we asked the waitress when our food will be ready and she said it will be a while because the restaurant is very busy and the kitchen is only so big. I've seen it much busier and waited less time. The service used to be better . 40 minutes to get our food."}
{"text":"Come at weekends but prepare to wait for a table. This place gets busy, which is a good sign I suppose! Menu I find is a little confusing in its layout but the staff are friendly, the food is good and the atmosphere is nice. .

Forgot to add. Been here two or three tines now and had to ask for coffee refills. Bit disappointing.

Overall, kind of average service and food but the fact that Boom here has little competition probably explains it's popularity. I'm not really impressed and would head elsewhere if I had the option."}
{"text":"This place opened recently near where I live, which I was stoked about considering the only other locations are way too far for me. I got the Western College Sandwich, which came with frites and fresh fruit. It was alright, as good as an egg sandwich can get. The frites were wonderfully seasoned and nice and crispy. I would come back when I'm in the mood for some breakfast foods/brunch again!"}
{"text":"Went there with a table for 6, for Sunday brunch.  Nice ambience given the location (Midtown).  Host served us free coffee while waiting for seats. Free Wi-Fi provided.   Brunch portion was kinda small.   Egg Benedict was not up to average standard. They poached the eggs for too long time, making it unpleasant texture.   Anyhow, the nice service gave us good impression,  in general."}
{"text":"I went to Boom with a group of 10 friends for brunch on a Sunday. It's only a 10 minute walk from Eglinton subway station which is great for those of us who don't have a car. We were seated right upon arrival (by the very friendly manager) which was a big relief considering how popular this place is and how big our group was. My friends and I regularly go out for brunch on the weekends so I have had my share of martian omelettes,freshly squeezed Tropicana orange juice and shitty fries. As a result I have come to appreciate a good brunch. The Benny Boom accompanied by a fresh glass of orange juice and a cup of coffee made a top notch brunch and a great cure for a hangover. It was sooo good, I was devastated after I had finished my meal (See my profile pic). Having tried some of the other items on the menu as well by forcefully pillaging my friends' plates, I highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I asked (politely) if I'd been given the correct breakfast meat because my \"locally smoked pork loin\" seemed more like slightly-warmed packaged grocery store ham (for the record, my words were: \"Excuse me, but I just wanted to check if this was the pork loin? The texture isn't quite like what I had last time\").

The waitress picked a paper napkin up off a neighboring table, dabbed at the pool of grease glistening from atop my pork product, handed it to me and said \"just wipe some of *that* [gestures towards pig oil] off. That'll help. They never clean that grill.\"

Lol.

Don't think I'll be coming back, but thanks for the complimentary meat-blotter!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went for breakfast here because we had read online that it was \"gluten free friendly\". As a celiac, I have found there are a lot of different interpretations of that term. In general, when I go to breakfast I realize that I am going to have to alter my meal somewhat in order to avoid gluten. At Boom Breakfast I wasn't able to have much on the menu. I was told none of their meats were gluten free - not sure how you put gluten into bacon. I also could not have their \"boom frites\" aka their hashbrowns. I was allowed to substitute for fruit but this ended up being one piece of melon and one piece of cantaloupe. It turned out that I ate eggs, a slice of gluten free toast - for which I paid 2.00 extra - and some \"fruit\". I was less than impressed. I can't rate the rest of the food for obvious reasons, but as a celiac I wouldn't ever bother going back."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out since it was rated as one of the top brunch spots in Toronto. The rating was indeed well deserved. When we reached the place we noticed a huge line outside. The waiting time was over 40 minutes but we decided to be patient and wait - it was absolutely worth it since the food as delicious. We ordered a few Bloody Caesars (well made) and Eggs Benedict (Oh Canada and the one with spinach).  The service was quick and pleasant. A delectable experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"They had been great until the last few times and today we were fed up!  Two groups of people were in front of us when we arrived and it seemed like they have been waiting for a long time.  Funny thing was there were approximately 4 or 5 empty tables waiting to be cleaned.  After waiting for 20 mins, only one table was cleaned and no one is bothered to clean the other ones!  This franchise should revamp the management team or else another great restaurant will go out of business soon!  Good luck!"}
{"text":"This place has some great food. I'm sensitive to salt and I found their meats not to be too salty. Great service too. You have to wait a bit to get seated but it's very much worth it."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I love brunch...so much that I brunch at least twice a week or more if possible!  I've been to Boom bkfast twice now and have had amazing food with exceptional friendly service!  I cannot say this enough times but what keeps people coming back to an establishment isn't only the food but the service and with Boom Breakfast you got both! I look forward to more brunches there.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"We searched for a breakfast place near yonge and eglinton and found boom breakfast, so we thought of trying it after reading some reviews. Unfortunately it was the worst breakfast we have ever tried!!

I ordered FARMER GIANN,  took the first bite of the omelette and I just couldn't swallow it! It had a bad stench to it. The pancake was mushy and sticking to the sides of the mouth. Though the place was full, and it was our first time there, we might have ordered the wrong dishes. I have tried far better breakfast places than this, but I would definitely not go there again."}
{"text":"15 min to be seated. 30min for food that was cold and overcooked. All after 2pm"}
{"text":"So we all know about the wait... The place was packed on a Sunday for brunch, but my wait was only 20mins.  Nice touch to offer coffee to those waiting, very good customer service. 

The non-dairy smoothie I had was great, and I had a tuna roll.   The roll was not bad but I would have preferred fresh instead of canned tuna.  
Bottomless good coffee was a nice touch.  
Real friendly staff.  
It's a really narrow space though, not ideal with wait staff, trays, beverages.   
3.5 star for sure."}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly service, cute atmosphere.  Not many options for alternative diets though. Would be nice if they had more gluten and dairy free alternatives. Seems like your usual diner-type breakfast spot with a more modern aesthetic."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing eggs Benedict, Sometimes they over cook. I'm guessing it depends on who's making them. Unfortunately their espresso is absolutely horrendous. Like I couldn't believe my taste buds. I wasn't expecting much but it was far from decent. I took one sip and just left it."}
{"text":"As previous poster mentioned, it just opened in the area.
Compared to the sunset grill its a five.
Compared to Coras five minute drive south on weston its a 1.
Pickle barrel beats them too.
Woodbridge prices."}
{"text":"Visited Boom in the Y&E area this past weekend; I really like the College location so I thought I would give this location a shot.  We arrived just shortly after 10:30am on Saturday and we were sitted right away.

Coffee followed after we were seated.  Our orders were taken after coffee was served and our meals followed about 10 minutes later.  Service was stellar, attentive and friendly.  Unfortunately, my meal was lack-lustre.  There were egg shells in my omelet and my toast was burnt.  I was able to get new unburnt toast but I did not bother to ask for another omelet.

My SO's pancakes were ok, a bit mushy but enjoyable.

I am a bit disappointed, the quality at the Boom restaurant has gone down.  I was expecting the same level of quality at the College location.

Shall I return?  Likely not at this location."}
{"text":"Two blocks west of the Yonge and Eglinton hub of activity, this brunch place is a pleasant surprise.

For a breakfast chain restaurant, this place doesn't suck.
(Unlike some other breakfast chain with a cute sun logo but horrifically crappy disgusting food).

This place was packed... but I liked how they give you free coffee while you wait.  There are a lot of booths for pairs.  Groups may have to wait a bit longer.

I liked the menu.  Lots of variety and there are healthy options.

Alright, i wanted to order something on the menu that other people weren't ordering.  

You know what? 
Next time someone orders what I want, I'm still going to order it.

Friend#1 ordered Oh Canada!  (Eggs Benedict with peameal bacon)
Friend#2 ordered California Spa-mellete (egg-whites, mushrooms, tomatoes, guacamole)
Myself: Waffle with chorizo with egg, that the waitress said was popular.

Everyone's breakfast looked delicious...except mine, which looked like something a 12 year old would assemble in home economics class.

*A large waffle (Which was fresh and hot but a bit undercooked)
*Fluffy scrambled eggs plopped on top of the waffle
*Topped with a ginormous chorizo sausage that was the star of the show

It just looked weird. I had to cut up the sausage and mix it with my eggs to make everything look like a meal.

The service is slow.
The waitstaff is a bit too busy to be very friendly.
They ran out of English muffins.
They serve fries. Fries are not hash browns.

I'll probably eat here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have brunch here."}
{"text":"Went with the girlfriend for Saturday brunch, and was pleasantly surprised when the host offered us fresh coffee while we waited for a table. 

Their were a few people ahead of us, but it wasn't outrageously busy. 

We we seated in a large and comfortable booth and enjoyed the fun and entertaining menu. 

Our waitress was pleasant, and efficient. She came and asked if we'd like anything to drink. I usually get an Earl Grey tea which I eventually got, as I needed a caffeine boost. 

But they had such interesting sounding smoothies, I started with an Apple Crumble smoothie (Apple, banana, granola, almond milk, cinnamon and honey). 

My girlfriend just got a coffee. 

My smoothie arrived shortly and it was so very good. Smooth, and it was like drinking a slice of apple pie. 

For my main, I got the Farmer Gianni omelette (baby spinach, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions and Swiss cheese. 

My girlfriend ordered the Green Eggs 'N Ham (two eggs, scrambled with baby spinach and pork loin). 

Both our meals came with Boom Fries and toast, and mine came with some fresh fruit. 

Our food was delicious and so very filling!

Mine was oozing with cheese -- so yummy. 

The service was awesome and food greet. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Last time I visited this location was about 4 years ago with my parents.  Today my friend and I went.  Nothing has changed with the location.   My friend and I both ordered Eggs Benny.  His was the Florentine and mine was the Benny Boom.  We both ordered freshly squeezed orange juice.  

What I can never understand is why freshly squeezed juice would cost almost $5?  Are we paying for time and labour or what?  You can get one bag of oranges for that much or less.  I mean supply and demand should not reflect the price of squeezed oranges.  Maybe we just should have stuck with the water.

I can't comment on what my friend ordered although one slice of salmon across a the two eggs was kind of cheap on the fixings too.  Because you call it a special type of smoked salmon shouldn't be $1.40 difference. Can't forget the Costco \"fresh\" fruit slices.

To top it off, our server was a grumpy Eastern European guy.  We barely finished our meals and he had our bill ready almost like he was ready to kick us out.  The person at the counter didn't even ask what our experience was like.  Lessons in customer service are highly needed.  

I won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"Masters of the basic breakfast. I love breakfast food... for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Too bad they're not open for dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious eggs benny! Visited this lovely little place last week for brunch. It wasn't busy, which was great. The service was very speedy and efficient. The coffee was delicious, and the eggs benny was cooked beautifully."}
{"text":"Dropped in here on a Saturday after a night out and was looking for greasy food lol.  DIdn't get it here.  Good service, food was out pretty fast and good.  Sausage and eggs were a bit on the dry side, but that may have been because I was looking for grease and was dehydrated.  The place was full and my party sat at the bar to avoid a wait.  I will definately try it again when I'm in the area and with all my senses intact."}
{"text":"Average. Maybe location downtown is better."}
{"text":"I've been here before a long time go, but I remember it wasn't memorable enough to leave an impression. The restaurant is busy enough on a Saturday afternoon, boasting a full house but oddly enough there was no line up, so we were seated after 10 minutes. The waitress was friendly, professional and attentive but the food took almost 30 minutes. The menu was double sided and had a large variety of options to choose from which was nice.   We ordered the Benedict VI and the Sausage eh. 

On the Benedict the eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise sauce struck the right balance between tanginess and creaminess; it didn't overpower the other elements on the dish, as some other renditions can. I asked for a med rare steak and it came out a medium, and was a bit on the dry and rough side. It was originally nestled underneath the eggs on the English muffin but I found it was more enjoyable when taken out of the sandwich and eaten separately , as the roughness of the meat actually diminished my enjoyment of the eggs Benny sandwich overall. Separately the eggs Benny was very good and the steak just tolerable. When I asked for hot sauce, the waitress highly recommended Melinda's xxxtra hot habanero pepper sauce. I was pleased to find out she was right; it added that extra kick to the dish and I dipped it in everything. Way better than regular Tabasco sauce IMO. 

The Sausage eh was a classic dish of breakfast sausage and eggs with toast and home fries and one half roasted tomato. No qualms about the eggs or sausage, the roasted tomato was also a nice touch. But the rye was over toasted and hard and the fries IMO were too crispy and hard as well ; I prefer home fries to be on the soft side with a light crisp , as \"home fries\" to me normally connotes searing fresh cut potatoes in a pan vs deep frying them. These fries seemed better suitable if paired with a burger or other lunch entree rather than breakfast. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here as there are so many brunch places in Toronto to try."}
{"text":"I am a Sunday breakfast regular! Very happy with the Tuscan sun which is poached eggs and roasted tomatoes with prosciutto on top of rye toast! Also the chick-a-dilla wrap is very light and fresh. Their hot sauce is a must, can't find it anywhere in stores! The only thing I wish they would change is the home fries! The potato wedges just don't cut it the same way home fries would. Overall great experience though!"}
{"text":"Good food great service. It's one of our regular breakfast spots. Love the frites and the sausages."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since my impromptu visit to Boom. I had heard other Toronto peeps sing the praises about this small chain of Toronto based breakfast spots and when hunger struck, all day breakfast was all I could think of for brunch. 

Very easy to miss if you are driving as it's about 150 ft West from the intersection of Yonge and Eglington. Also they do not have their own parking so depending on the time of day, you'll either need to seek out street parking OR find a spot in the governement building pay parking next door. Not to worry if you can get in and out in less than 1 hour you don't pay. Challenge accepted.

Not a bad little spot, it's not better or no worse than any other breakfast joint I've hit up so I think a 3 star (A-OK) is right about where this place should live. 

For breakfast I diner on their 3 eggs option with coffee and OJ. One differentiator that I did like about this place is the complimentary roasted tomato served with each meal, and I really like the cooked cured pork as option as opposed to the standard bacon, ham and/or sausage. Very tasty and cooked well. 

I'd reco this place if you pass it by and are looking for breakfast/brunch options :)

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"First off, MATTHEW our server was fantastic! He was so pleasant and helpful (we had a baby at our table) and it made a world of a difference to have him serve us! Boom take note of this asset! 

The wait: there wasn't really one if u get in just before 11:30 but any time after that there will be a steady rush although everyone was seated rather quickly. 

Loads to order from on the menu and at the moment they have fun Pan-Am option on the menu. 

I had the California spa-lette which is a healthy option of egg whites, spinach, guac, salsa, fruits and choice of toast. If you want feta added, note that there is a $1.30 (approx) extra charge which will be offered but my server didn't mention that it would come at an extra cost. It didn't affect my review cause I didn't mind paying it but just a warning to my fellow helpers. 

I also had the chocolate Waffles which comes with strawberries and banana topped with chocolate sauce. The waffle was perfectly delicious but didn't really see much of the powdered sugar action on top as per menu.

My friend got the Mexican pan am option and the other got the quesadilla option and all went home happy and full. 

BOTTOMLESS COFFEE? Yes please! 

Pricing is normal: 2 mains (above) + coffee + feta cheese = $27.94 

If you sit closer to the entrance it does get quite hot as you are closer to kitchen so if you want to stay cool in the occasional TO heat, ask for the seats in the back. 

Will be back with reinforcement to try other menu options."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday. 

Pros:
- Banquet Burger  was tasty as we're the sweet potato fries 
- Service was good 
-Typical American family diner.
- Decenlty priced 

Cons
- Had to wait about 15 minutes for a table for 4.
- Wedges were bland
- Very busy"}
{"text":"Just what I was looking for on a Wednesday morning.  Very friendly waitress, good service, good food, free WiFi, classic 80's music.

The high energy omelette was good but the chicken chorizo was chewy  (say that 5 times fast). And I agree with other posters that the potatoes need to be replaced, they were just ok.

The highlight was the friendly waitress!   :-)"}
{"text":"The food was ok......but couldn't make up for the terrible customer service. On a busy Sunday morning we did expect to wait for a table....however the hostess seated two groups of the same size that arrived after us before us. When I asked her about it she denied it but her list clearly showed our group ahead of the others. We were then seated in a booth too small for our party. Our server was slow to come over and after taking our drink order took 15 min to come back for our food order."}
{"text":"Food is pretty average. Weird extra charges I'm not used to, like $2 for maple syrup...

 Service was fairly bad. Server forgot my drink order three times, spilled coffee in my eggs, and generally didn't seem to care.

Wouldn't come back unless I had to."}
{"text":"This is a very cute breakfast spot uptown. Very friendly service and it has a very homey vibe. As breakfast selection goes it has great brunch options. It can be a long wait on the weekends so of recommend going early. Pricing is quite fair for the amount of good food you get."}
{"text":"Food always comes out fresh and hot - many options on the menu, including healthy ones.. My favorite is the Californian spamellete. The only frustrating thing is waiting in line. I now go earlier to avoid waiting.  The staff are nice, but seem extremely busy - sometimes I feel rushed to get out.."}
{"text":"Loved our experience here. We walked in and there were a couple people waiting. The server was kindly offering those in line free coffee while we waited! Thank you!!!!

We were seated soon after and the restaurant is much deeper and bigger than it looks with a very nice patio area.

Food was decent and prices were okay for what you get. 

I would definitely come back again!! 

Very clean as well!'"}
{"text":"Was just there this morning and actually the worst service I've had in the city. The server was rude, didn't even look at us - dumped things on the table and walked off. 

Was hoping the food would make up for it but it didn't, average across the board from an over cooked omelet to dishwater coffee"}
{"text":"I found this place recently for the first time after having a pretty bad experience down the road at Sunset Grill on Yonge street. Man, was I happy with to find Boom! It contrasts very well with higher quality food, larger servings, and significantly better service. The only thing keeping me from giving this place 4 stars is that it is strangely quite expensive for a breakfast joint. It is definitely possible to find the same quality for cheaper around the city. That being said, it's still quite good and worth it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Is there anything bad to say about all day breakfast?

Almost everything on their menu is below $15.  I had the Oh Canada Eggs Benny that substitutes the pork loin for peameal bacon.  No complaints.  The taters were also delicious on the side.  I'll try the standard breakfast next time.  They have some healthy options as well.  Coffee is bottomless and service is quick.  I did see a patio out back too.  You can't really beat this place on a weekend morning/afternoon with the selection in the yonge and eg area.  Is it the most amazing breakfast? Not really, but it's reliable and good."}
{"text":"Love it, my go to place. Make sure to make reservations on the weekend as it can get quite full. I love all the omelettes, I go for the rye bread usually and it is exceptional. You can have a light breakfast or a more hearty meal, it hits the spot with a bit of sophistication. I highly reccomend this place for kids and familie."}
{"text":"found a larave type of worm fall out of my food as I was about to put the food in my mouth! So gross started to move around on my lap!"}
{"text":"I found this place to be ok. The biggest problem is there is always a little queue on weekends. Also, their eggs are good, but Toronto has many other better breakfast places than this one, including chains like Cora's or Eggsmart."}
{"text":"Love this spot, super busy on weekends. The quality of breakfast items is better than your typical greasy spoon."}
{"text":"Reliable place...great breakfast food...and their wedged potatoes are ON POINT!...

Been here about 5 times and I'd say, my latest visit was probably the only time where i'd say the service was good. 

They would probably get a 5 star from me if the service was better. 

I have only had their egg benedict and classic breakfast and both were not a disappointment."}
{"text":"The food here is fine, but most importantly, they were open at 9:30 this morning when most other places aren't yet, the food came up fast, the coffee is bottomless and decent, and they let us sit in our booth for like a freaking hour after we finished our food, just drinking more free coffee and shooting the shit - despite the big group at the door.

So I guess maybe those people will write a 1-star review to cancel mine out, but hey, I tried. Thanks for having us, BOOM!!"}
{"text":"A bunch of us were hungry after boxing and someone suggested Boom. I had no expectations and was just hungry enough to eat anything. First off, it was not a great place for more than 4 ppl because the booths only seat 2-4 ppl and the only large seating is in the back, which is usually taken up. If the service was quicker they would get more turn-a-round and less line ups at the front of the house. Yep, the service is less than slow and food doesn't come out any quicker. I had the manhattan steak and it was a major disappointment. I figured if they ask how I want my steak done, they would know how to cook it properly. Steak was some thin piece of overly cooked meat. The fried potato wedges were pretty good and the coffee is just okay. Other than that, I would have rather gone to Cora's because the place seemed very similar but the only difference is Cora's food and service is better. This place is too much hype and not enough boom."}
{"text":"I love this location in the summer...The patio in the back is definitely a treat. I usually order the egg white omelette with cheese. Fresh fruits and coffee. Summer brunches are really good there. However I was the only guy in a group of 4. The bee's did make the ladies act very girlie. Meh. Mother nature of course. Eggs and Mimosa's in a nice patio is always swell during the weekend."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time based on reviews. When we first came in  o one greeted us even though i did see the staff see us come in. After a little while, one of the associates came and greeted us. Told us at the wait was going to be about 15 minutes but it was quicker than that. They brought us over to a small table which we needed a high chair for. It was great that they provided the high chair for us but it was in such of a tight area it was a bit uncomfortable. Our server was okay seemed a little rush as it was busy time for them. Food was really good very much different than the regular Sunset Grill or Denny's.
Very cozy atmosphere I enjoyed the location maybe I'll try going in when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"So yummy!

Breakfast is already the best meal of the day, and Boom Breakfast just makes it better! I ordered the California Spa-mellete - just imagine, something on the menu that is standard with egg whites! Seriously! It came with fresh fruit, and guacamole! And the orange juice, oh the fresh orange juice - with pulp and everything! I felt like I was in Florida! 

I will definitely come back here on my subsequent visits to TO."}
{"text":"Fast service, good quantities and nice food!!! Really love the smoothie and salad here!!! The salad is full of cheese and taste awesome. If I have chance, I definitely will go there again!"}
{"text":"Yummy, juicy and big sausages!! Lol. Decently portioned breakfast and very good selection. Restaurant gets pretty packed after 9am during the weekend. Servers could be a little more attentive and quick."}
{"text":"Started off with bartender making two mimosas, when only one was ordered.  The waitress gave us the second for free.  I said \"tell the bartender he can continue to make these mistakes all day!\"

Service was friendly.  The waitress let each table know with updates of when the food would arrive.  A bit of a wait is expected on a packed Sunday, the updates is all you can ask for.  She then brought a plate of muffins and fruit, complementary due to the kitchen being backed up.  Great service.

I've been to the Eglington location where the food is decent.  It's equally as good here.  Some of these old reviews may have been opening pains.  The eggs Benny with prosciutto was perfectly cooked.  My son loved his chocolate monkey waffles, I can't comment since that's not my thing.  My son said \"dad, order sausage!\"  Good call kid, because they were bursting with flavour.

3 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"Breakfast was a home run. Fresh coffee, great smoothies and the omelettes were prepared perfectly. Add to that a very attentive and curious staff - it's no wonder the line-up was 'out the door'"}
{"text":"Am I nuts or am I actually giving a review more positive than Kris U?  Wow.  Maybe I'm overcompensating my singleness on Valentine's Day, but oh well.  

General Likes: HUGE breakfast menu. they had over 50 meals and it was just overwhelming, cute little booths, good service, decent coffee, decent food.

General Dislikes:  no street parking, and yeah that's really about it.  Coffee kind of pricey at $2.29.

Food order: NYC LOX & scrambled egg with coffee.  The lox was okay, nothing special and the scrambled eggs were okay. However, the poppy seed bagel was so fresh, it was like heaven.  I didn't even put butter on it!!!  Oh yeah, the wedges were adequately seasoned as well.  So the NYC LOX and scrambled egg combo came with scrambled eggs mixed with lox, bagel, and potato wedges for $9.29 (I think).  Not cheap, but not too expensive either.  As for the coffee, it was decently strong and tasted like a coffee, which is rare for diners these days.  So I was happy with it, especially the free refills.  

Verdict: Great breakfast place with huge selection in the Yonge/Eg area."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years for brunch. Really love this specialty restaurant and fast friendly service. The menu has evolved over the years. There's a great selection of healthy breakfast options, comfort breakfast entrees, salads, eggs Benedict and protein options. Great kids menu. This last visit in a Sunday around 10:30 am and it was a perfect time just before it got super busy. There are long lineups so be prepared to wait if you're caught with a crowd. Ordered the Benedict VI eggs benny, kids fruit and waffle, cheese omelet and side of bacon. Everything tasted great. Overall great brunch restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Good not great. 

Not much of a breakfast guy but I was starving and it is very close.

Had the steak and eggs. 

The steak quality was good, had a little too much fat for me but I am a filet mignon type of guy so I am never happy with fat. 

Eggs were scrambled so not much to report there. 

Fresh fruit was a welcomed addition to my meal. 

If you are a breakfast person try it out, you may like it."}
{"text":"How does this place operate? I fail to understand it. Today we waited one hour for our food.. one hour! The server told us after 40 min that they were having trouble with the kitchen. Don't you think it would have been appropriate to tell us from the start that the kitchen was having issues? We told management we were dissatisfied and all they said was \"sorry\". Sorry? We waited an hour for eggs... seriously... no... your food isn't that great to wait one hour. When we got our pancakes, they were burnt. The food is fine, but the service is terrible and they're unprofessional. Also, the server brought our forks with her hands touching the prongs. I had to embarrass her and tell her, please get me a fork in a napkin without your hands all over it. There is a handle on a fork... why are you touching the prongs? It baffles me. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times and have always had an enjoyable experience. Service was reasonably quick, definitely friendly and they serve a solid brunch. I give only 3 stars because there's nothing overly spectacular, but if you want a good Eggs Benedict, you won't go wrong at Boom. I will keep going back!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service! Great food with fruit on the side of both our breakfasts! The food is so filling and delicious. Fresh orange juice is really good as well!"}
{"text":"I went to this  place about 3 months ago, there's nothing great. The food it's OK the coffee it's OK, our server was super nice. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I never order soup... anywhere so, I decided to have BOOM's daily soupspecial last Wednesday. 

Their egg-drop soup Italian style (that, or it was Spanish...) went BOOM! in my mouth. I totally wasn't expecting the zest! On the side, I had the Brioche toast and, no lies, it was FLUFFY. Boom is definitely doing this Brunch thing right. Tried a piece of my friend's french toast and yes, yes, yes! It was lovely! 

Service was good. When I got the soup our server offered to garnish it with some ground paper. She did it for me and... I felt like royalty. I have to... no, scratch that, AM come back here! Plus, I enjoy the diner-esque decor and the large open window too much not to."}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast place with very good service. The place was packed when we arrived and the host brought up free coffee which was a really nice touch. 

I had the omelet with turkey chorizo, feta, grilled tomato and mushroom and it was delicious. Side order of fruit was good but sparse. Kinda pricey but given the location it's to be expected. Good find."}
{"text":"My new favourite neighbourhood breakfast place. Clean and casual environment, service was friendly and accommodating, food was really good and reasonably priced. Definitely will go back there again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been going to boom on St.  Clair for years.  When this location opened up we had to go. Now, this is our breakfast spot when we have days off. The servers are all nice, as we always get the same things the servers already know our order(Sup Michael)

They are very busy during weekends so expect a wait but believe me it is well worth it. 

Everything on their menu is good. Service is fast. Price is good. This place is a must if you like breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is great! I love the fact that their omelettes aren't so greasy and the whole place is decorated nicely. Pricing is decent, the special that they have advertised on the tables are a good deal. Waiters/waitresses are usually welcoming. Overall a hit!"}
{"text":"Heard about boom decided to try it . Even though the atmosphere is nice . The wait is terrible even is they seat you quickly . Ordered 2eggs and sausage and it took over 50mins . Juice was like warmcoffee was cold Breakfast was good but took way too long . Much better places in Toronto like George street diner with amazing hand made soda bread"}
{"text":"Great service and great tasting eggs florentine made for a 4 star experience at Boom. We were happy to sit out back on the patio begin the building too."}
{"text":"I only came here for breakfast so I really can't comment on anything else, but I really enjoyed this small brunch spot! Surprised with some of the low reviews, but honestly everyone's experience is different. My visit here was great. The French toast, sausage EH meal and freshly squeezed orange juice was all a hit. I also really love their wedges that come with their breakfast plates. I would def come back here! Also had great service but I can't remember the servers name."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times over the past couple of years. They have a varied breakfast/brunch/lunch menu and an inconspicuous sandwich board (which is always on the sidewalk) advertising the $4.99 breakfast which is only available Monday-Thursday between 7 and 10am.

Yesterday, I had the threesome which includes 2 eggs any style, sausage, pancake and toast. The eggs were the best part of the meal, perfectly cooked. The pancake was ever so slightly burnt (ever so slightly...or I'm just picky). The sausage was underwhelming and too peppered. The toast is toasted unbuttered (unless you ask otherwise when ordering). 

Service is friendly and attentive; however, you can tell they try and not have people sitting too long. Price point is relatively high. For two people when you incorporate drinks, tax and tip, it averages out to about $15 per person. I'll probably return as it's close to home and the food is good."}
{"text":"I came here on Boxing Day with my two girl friends for brunch. Standard brunch -- nothing that really blew my mind (which was actually.. slightly disapponting). Got the hueveos rancheros burrito... Again, nothing spectacular. Tea was a bit expensive for my liking, considering that... it was just a tea bag in a pot. It could've been better. *shrugs* Oh well."}
{"text":"4.5 stars *** 

It's said that you can't really screwed up breakfast, but trust me when I say this I've been to some pretty bad brunch restaurants. This place was definitely the better one that I've had, service was very friendly, food was really fresh and tasty (loved the wedges!). No complaints here!!"}
{"text":"My Orders: sweet chorizo benny & mimosa 

PROS
+ Service: friendly. The waitress gladly took my group's picture and ensured that everyone's drinks and meals came together. I can't complain. 
+ Food: Tasty. I feel like the $5 mimosa could've come in a bigger cup (125 ml tops). But the benny was thoroughly enjoyable. I expected it to be sweet (hence the title of the dish) but it wasn't. 

CONS
- Seating: I should've made reservations. While I was initially told that it would be a 15 minute wait, I wasn't seated for a good 45 minutes. It was a good thing that I came early, however, my entire party ended up having to wait alongside with me. I can't complain though, it's to be expected for Sunday brunch. 

I'm excited that this area of Vaughan is developing and offering more fancy schmancy brunch options. You go GTA! :D"}
{"text":"I would have gave this a 4 stars last time but I'm writing a review after my visit today and I felt a 3.5 star would be most accurate. Last time I visited it was packed but the servers were very nice and kept updating us on the wait time. Today it wasn't packed and I see lots of tables that are waiting to be cleaned up, and the front server was checking her phone before check us in after we stood there for over 5 minutes. Given the amount of customers, the wait time for the food was also longer than expected. However their breakfast was good as usual and I would give it a 4 stars and particularly I like their apple cider a lot."}
{"text":"Lazy Sunny and warm Saturday afternoon - check
Two sleepyheaded people searching for food - check

So the BF and I wandered into Boom Breakfast, because he wanted to go to a shoe sale in the area, so I agreed to \"keep\" him company. But before we headed to the sale, we found ourselves searching for breakfast like food @ 2pm in the afternoon...

Boom fit the bill perfectly, a nice sunny area with a backyard patio to the back; which was closed off; offering breakfast fare.

Food - pretty good, BF ordered the Acapulco Gold Omelette, and me the Boom P-BLT. I didn't get a chance to taste the omelette, but their homefries were pretty good, better than the Cottage fried potatoes @ O&B. 

Their Peameal bacon BLT was pretty good, once i added a touch a mayo on it. But overall hit the spot.

We also ordered their fresh squeezed apple juice, which wasn't too bad, but I thought a tad overpriced. 

I noticed their takeout counter menu on the way out, seems to be a decent deal 4.99 for a breakfast sandwich of grilled cheese and bacon with a coffee... might be worth investigating on a later date.

cheap garage parking at the community centre next door $1 an hour otherwise street parking"}
{"text":"Came here twice, once around 11 am weekday and once at 1:30 pm Saturday. Both times, the place was packed. Except on the weekday, the wait was 10 minutes as opposed to 30+. 

Food here was pretty good. I liked their big breakfast menu. They have everything my heart desired. Wanted to eat like everything on the list. Took us about 15 minutes to decide what to get. Next time I'll need to decide at home before I head over to the restaurant. 

I had the blueberry pancakes the first time. Two large pancakes stacked atop each other. It was alright, nothing special but took care of my cravings. 

The second time I had the sausage, eggs, and toast combo. That was yummy. Their sausages are huge. The eggs were perfect. My toast was slathered in buttery goodness. Yum! 

Bottomless coffee was decent, not too watery as some diners make it. 

I love the retro hip vibe of this place. It's blue, yellow, and lots of fun :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed breakfast at Boom Breakfast this weekend. The seasoning on the potato wedges (called Boom Frites), the peameal bacon, and multigrain bread were highlights. They also had two hot sauce options - chipotle and a triple x habanero sauce. Lots of smoothie options but I didn't try any. The restaurant goes back further than I thought and is light and airy at the back. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Boom really surprised me (pleasantly).  My first impression was of a clean, warm, comfortable atmosphere and friendly staff.  As I was alone, I took a seat at the bar at the front. 

They have a decent selection of interesting-sounding breakfast dishes, so I decided to go with the Bagel Rachero - two eggs, tomato, and guacamole on a bagel, served with \"Boom frites\", fresh fruit, and a small dish of refried beans.  Everything was great, and even the fruit was fresh and tasty.  My bottomless coffee was refilled regularly, and I polished off everything on my plate, leaving me quite full.

The bill of $13.76 (plus tip) is a tiny bit hard to swallow for breakfast for one person though, and is the only reason that Boom gets 4 stars instead of 5.  

They also do a breakfast sandwich (several choices - on english muffins) and small coffee to go for $4.99, which I'll have to check out sometime."}
{"text":"I don't eat here as much as I'd like...

Boom is an all-day breakfast joint with reasonable prices and 'just right' portions. This location is close to my work, which makes it the perfect place for our annual department breakfast. From the outside, it looks small, but there's quite a bit of space. Whenever I have breakfast or brunch here, I order the Huevos Rancheros (very tasty). There is a Monday to Thursday value meal as well and I believe it's $6. Unlimited refills of coffee is a great touch.

Good for: groups, casual dining"}
{"text":"We came in here based on the reviews on Yelp, which you can see are high but nobody is raving about the food. Its a child friendly place in the Yonge and Eglinton area of town that is easy for breakfast/brunch with the family. 

The following was our order:

My husband ordered the banana/chocolate french toast and coffee. He hated the coffee but the french toast was yummy. 

I ordered the eggs florentine which is served on brioche and was good but was lacking something. I also had the fresh apple juice, which was awesome. I love fresh juices, who doesnt! 

Childrens mini pancakes and apple juices for the little man...he ate and drank both. 

While you wait to be seated on person sometimes goes around with nibblers and coffee....dont know why he walked by me for both but I guess its cause I wasnt in a group of 20-something beautiful people which were the bulk of the customers waiting with me ;)"}
{"text":"I had the Oh Canada Eggs Benny and the english muffin was stale. Hollandaise wasnt appealing. Compeletely forgettable. Giggling Tomataoes have better Eggs Benny and they even charge less."}
{"text":"I think I may have been let down by this place because of all the rave reviews. But the fact is, I've eaten here twice and neither time was spectacular. 

My expectations of a breakfast place are cheap prices, good food (because eggs are hard to mess up), fast turnover and service. This place has prices on the high end of breakfast place, on weekends they are very crowded and it will take some time to be seated and the food is alright. 

The last time I went, I was with my husband and we went in the door to a huge crowd. There was no wait to be seated sign, but we guessed correctly and waited. Problem is that you pay and wait in the same place, which meant people were coming and going in a very small area. It was chaos for awhile. Finally we were seated outside at a picnic table and told that other people may be seated with us at the table, because they lacked space. 

The waitress took some time to arrive and by then we were ready to give our order. I ordered eggs and bacon and toast. We also each ordered fruit smoothies. I asked for mine without banana. The waitress came back a few minutes later and said with a straight face, \"The guys back there put like three bananas in your smoothie!\" 

It took me a minute to realize she was joking....heh....

We played several rounds of Scrabble on an iphone because the food was taking quite awhile and it finally came out. Our drinks were no where to be seen. We had to ask twice for them. By then we were almost done the food!

The food was alright, but I usually go to places like Egg Smart and for the cost, they give you way more food, for a better price and honestly, I think it tastes way better. These famous \"Boom frites\" are just thick, cut potatoes and they give you one slice of toast! 

Anyway, if you're in the area and really want some breakfast, it's not terrible, but I think you can do way better! 

Oh, and I disagree that it's a good place for a group. Unless you want to wait forever...or make a group by joining another couple at their picnic table!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch while staying near St. Clair West in Toronto. All day breakfast til close which is cool. Chose Boom from a recommendation over the Starving Artist right down the block which is mainly waffle selections with an assortment of sides and toppings. Came at 11:00am with my girlfriend because we were craving some eggs and brunch cocktails. She tried the bloody mary which was a little spicy and my mimosa was pretty good. Girlfriend got eggs, pancake and bacon and I did the veggie omelet and asked for a side of fruit instead of fries. All I got was two pieces of melon so that was disappointing. Bottomless coffee was a cool perk with my breakfast selection. Open kitchen which is always nice and pretty good service. They have an outdoor seating area but was too chilly for us."}
{"text":"Classic north American breakfast place with a personal touch. Welcoming staff, good quality a quiet environment. A good place to start the day."}
{"text":"I'll be back.  Big breakfasts, with a variety of dishes for the hardcore breakfast lover to the brunch enthusiast, to the lunch-only please.

Homefries are so good, I'd come back just for a bowl of them!

Service was prompt and friendly- but there weren't a lot of people when we went in.

Decor is very breakfast-nook-ish, makes you want to order and enjoy everything breakfasty.

Open kitchen, so you know how your food is being prepared, and exactly just how many eggs are going into that omlette!

Benches are a bit dated and torn, but the quality of the food makes up for it! and the rest of the place is pretty clean."}
{"text":"Ok food. Good service. Lots of choices. If I'm going out to pay for brunch I would rather have better quality."}
{"text":"Whoot! Bang - BOOM!

This place gets two thumbs up from me. It has a high end greasy spoon diner feel to it. I dig it. It looks much nicer on the inside than on the outside, thats for sure!!

Menu looked lovely with LOTS of options. I had the California Spa-mellete (egg-whites open face omelet with mushrooms, spinach and  tomatoes with sides of guacamole, salsa fruit and toast) - yum!

Only a 4 out of 5 because the service was slow and not as friendly as it should be."}
{"text":"I decided that maybe Boom was having an off day when I last went, so I gave it another chance recently - and was pleasantly surprised.

Very quick seating on the simple, large back patio - and waited on by a server who was elegant, sharp and good with recommendations.

I ordered a standard breakfast - bacon, eggs, pancake, fruit, toast with fresh squeezed apple juice - I suppose I could have ordered something more fancy, but kinda just wanted to see how the standard fare would play out.  Pretty good - almost everything was fresh & well-presented, and I got some bonus extra bacon because the server noted that the bacon was a *little* too crispy.

Decent price too - the meal for two came to just about $30 - and for the amount of food we ordered, that was more than reasonable.

So, Boom, I'm glad we had a better experience together this time.  Everyone is allowed an off day or two."}
{"text":"If it was possible to leave no stars I would. I went to this establishment with some coworkers to enjoy a lovely work lunch on a Friday afternoon, although, it wasn't so lovely. The meals took over an hour for a group of 8 people who ordered variations of eggs and bacon, which from home cooking experience takes anywhere from 5-10 minutes. By the time the meals arrived at our tables, all contents of the plate were cold and the waiter was no where to be found to provide feedback so I'm leaving it here. I would highly suggest staying home to eat breakfast and not coming to this restaurant whatsoever."}
{"text":"My pregnant spouse and I were waiting for 30 minutes as we watched three groups who checked in after us get seated ahead of us. This after one of the regulars who walked in after us got checked in before us.

After reading through some of the other reviews I guess it should have been obvious to me that we didn't meet the appearance criteria of this location. It's a shame that this location is operated by stuck up snooty individuals who have a prejudice towards others based on what brand clothing they wear or if they have too many tattoos.

I love Boom on college street; there, we are treated like humans instead of being ignored.

Horrible customer service, horrible experience. Never coming back.

Learn how to treat customers."}
{"text":"Lox eggs benny! Perfectly runny eggs benedict with smoked salmon. The fruit today was really ripe. The home fries were seasoned wedges. Very good.

Bottomless coffee, freshly squeezed juices, smoothies with either regular milk or soy milk, frozen yoghurt.

I've been here a couple of times before and it was pretty good, but this time around, for some reason, it was awesome!

Service is fast. The food is affordable and good value for money. I would recommend this place if you're in the area.

Patios are nice. There's a front one and a back one, but watch out for all the bees!"}
{"text":"Restaurant has a cozy feeling, great food and great service by peter, soups are okay nothing great, overall had a good experience with this breakfast place, would recommend! I give it 4 booms out of 5 booms"}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed the food here, the last time I visited. 
The staff were friendly, we didn't have to wait in line for a table and our service was quick. 

I'm a breakfast lover, so this place had a range of items for me to choose from, this makes me happy. 

The portions are big, so come along hungry!"}
{"text":"I have an aversion to \"sit yourself\" and pay at counter joints. I also have an affinity to pancakes. A 4star is quite a feet when I should already be stripping a shop of their stars.

Staff was great.... fantastic, I'd have to say best staff in breakfast joints in Vaughan.

I got a coffee for $2.50, saw the boom all day and got that instead, free coffee plus other stuff for 6$...

I look like a degenerate more so today then usual, but the staff was fast and friendly kept bringing refills asking if everything was ok, maybe they were worried I was homeless and was gonna dash??(probably not with an iPhone)

With every shop doing their spin on home fries, potatoes, hash browns they probably have the healthier alternative and 2nd tastiest spuds.

Coffee was good and flavourful even after cream and sugar. Eggs were perfectly executed.

The pancakes, with chocolate sauce, it's 2016, everyone is using Nutella now, but even that stuff wouldn't be able to salvage the pancakes, the batter whatever healthy alternative that it might be just sucked, sorry.

If I had a group of people that needed to be happy with service I'd bring them here. Staff gave 110%

Just me alone, can't say I'll be back again... maybe for lighter fare or just to sit drink coffee and read a paper"}
{"text":"Love it, not pretentious at all, an overall great place for brunch. It has several locations in Toronto, and food quality is consistent!"}
{"text":"My friend and I have breakfast at least twice a month after yoga.  Terrific breakfasts with healthy fruit and yogurt or just wonderful eggs and toast.   Very accommodating staff."}
{"text":"Our second time at Boom and was likely our last.  The food was decent, no complaints but service needs to be improved.  When we got there line up was okay, we expect to wait 15-20 minutes which is no big deal...however, shortly after a bunch of people showed up who knew either the manager or owner there got to jump the queue, which is done pretty obvious so that's a huge disappointment in how their business is run, I understand it's their business they could do whatever they want but that's the rating it deserves by treating your other customers who patiently wait for their turn.  Other than that, just the waitress who serves coffee ignored to give us cream/milk which is pretty standard stuff...enough to say we don't expect to go back in any foreseeable future."}
{"text":"Went for a Sunday brunch, and it was quite busy. But my friends and I didn't feel rushed at all. Service was great. I tried the Benny Boom which was basically the eggs benedict and it was quite good. My friends also seemed to have enjoyed their meals as well. A friend had the burger with sweet potato fries and those fries were fantastic!!! Only down side was that another friend ordered turkey chorizo as a side and it was super duper salty and inedible. Ill likely be coming back."}
{"text":"Nothing special and not many veg savoury options. The hot sauce that they provide is amazing though"}
{"text":"Great hang-over Sat or Sun brunch spot.  Steady busy ... a bit of a wait but not too bad.  Great range of greasy spoon type of breakfast dishes to choose from.  Real coffee machine too.  Nice patio out back."}
{"text":"Boom, was a bad start to our sunday morning into the city. Found it by chance as we drove by. We have been to a boom on college st. We arrive before a group and the server attended the group and couples who got there after us. Waited to be seated,  just to have other couples and groups of 3 seated before me and my husband who were there before. Ended up leaving so let's just say service left a bitter taste in my mouth. Not returning to that location for sure."}
{"text":"Came in with my family, 2 hours before closing. After ordering 3 burgers and a power breakfast we were told \"only have 2 burgers left\" , no worries so we ordered another breakfast. Were told again that we do have burgers but will take awhile, I asked how long ? The waitress \"I don't know\" ( now this is actually the issue) all it takes is to got the kitchen and ASK. We decided to keep the breakfast order...the eggs were not exactly what I wanted, rather the waitress did not hear me or was in auto pilot when she walked over and asked if everything was ok, she also missed a side order and brought it over just about the time I finished my meal. Simple customer service that was lacking...too bad it's fairly good at most times."}
{"text":"We used to go often, and I was a big fan of some of their dishes. But lately, those dishes have disappeared off the menu, their Eggs Benny was bland and horrible and service has declined. 

Our favourite server is no longer there, and the others come and ask you whether you'd like the bill even before you've finished eating."}
{"text":"Decent brunch. Definitely come here if you live in the area or if it's a convenient meeting spot, but it's not worth traveling for just for the food. Just good plain solid food, nothing spectacular, except for the Boom fries.

The Boom fries are THE BOMB. The fries are steak fries with a very crispy crust (they must dip it in some sort of starch to get the extra crispiness) and seasoning. Be sure to get some fries when you're here. 

They have an outdoor patio in the back. Nothing fancy, but nice to sit out on a beautiful sunny day."}
{"text":"Boom was more boo for me...womp womp. Eh. It was pretty standard diner fare. Nothing stood out to me. When we arrived there was no one in the restaurant to greet us, and the place was already open 1hr...hmmmm. The food was just ok. My homefries were more potato wedges than the breakfast variety. My eggs were good. The peameal bacon was ok. I was essentially thin sliced ham, but wasn't that moist, was a little dry...I don't know, I didn't find it to be a standout breakfast. It was easy replicated by about any diner so I didn't standout to me."}
{"text":"Very happy to have found this place. Our waiter was friendly and happy to help, checked in with us regularly and didn't forget anything. I had the Sausage Eh and it was great, generous portions and the fries were well seasoned. My daughter loved her pancakes and the fresh squeezed orange juice. The coffee was definitely on the better side of what I've experienced in Vaughan so far. Will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Revisited Boom last weekend and was more impressed this time around than on my last visit. 

I had eggs (no yolk), toast, frittes, pork loin (instead of bacon) and tea. Frittes are a bit odd for breakfast as they're really mini versions of french fries, so I asked if I could order home fries/hash browns and pay extra, but was told frittes was the only option.

Everyone else at the table had bacon and eggs, with the same sides as I did save for coffee. We all enjoyed our meal although it did take an unusually long time for it to come out from the kitchen. 

Windows now have sun shades.....a nice touch as it can get quite bright in the restaurant. The décor is one of the better places as far as breakfast restaurants go.

Only small complaint was service. Our waitress was very busy but was still welcoming. One of my dining companions requested a glass of water while ordering their meal and was told \"certainly\"...but never got it. When our meals came out our waitress asked if anyone at the table would like water. The person who initially requested the water asked again and this time it was brought out. Our waitress had completely forgotten about the first request. Just a small annoyance in an otherwise good visit.

I would recommend the restaurant for breakfast to others however, the determining factor on whether I'll return again is the potato dish with breakfast. My personal preference is for home fries/hash browns and as this is not an option here, I'm a tad more hesitant to return."}
{"text":"Great place to go to in the area for brunch with friends to catch up.  The food is not spectacular, but does the job.  i ordered a Benny Boom.  The home fries were great - perfectly crispy and tasty.  The fruit was a bit bland and out of season.  The eggs benny - which included spinach and smoked salmon, were not my fave.  The spinach was pretty limp, and the hollandaise sauce strangely stiff.  Not much passion in the food.  

However, love the fresh squeezed juices here.  Apple juice was fantastic!

Service here is on point.  

Come here if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place, after the last 2 visits to Cora's were disappointing we tried Boom. What a difference! We sat at the bar and watched our food being cooked, our coffee never got empty and the food was amazing.
I had the poached eggs on prosciutto and roasted tomatoes all piled on a slice of rye toast with a side of home fries. The eggs were done perfectly. Hubby had an omelet with chorizo and peppers and said it was amazing.
We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a rainy Saturday.  Yes it was busy, but we only waited 5 minutes and we were seated in a cozy booth.  The waitress was super friendly and kept coming by to offer coffee refills. I had the Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and spinach.  Absolutely yummy!  The fruit on my plate was the only downer cuz the cantaloupe and orange slice tasted bad.  The potato wedges that came with meal was perfect.  My cousin ordered the threesome (2 eggs cooked anyway you want, pancake,bacon) with toast and fruit on the side.  The fruit on her plate was same to mine.  Overall the food was great, we enjoyed our meal, good service and didn't have to wait long for our orders to arrive.  Will go back sometime in the future and hope to try other things on the menu.  The seating was very comfortable and well lighted.  Would recommend my friends to go here for a yummy brunch."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times for breakfast. They remind me of what grandma used to cook when we visited her house and she'd cook breakfast. Love the wedges and the food is the perfect amount.

Price rage is average for breakfast. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Since someone else recently started off by saying how much they love brunch, I'll start off by saying how little I love brunch. Don't get me wrong, I love eggs and toast, but the idea of spending $20 on eggs and toast with a large group of people that are also okay with the idea of spending $20 on eggs and toast is just weird to me. That said, Boom has good breakfast! My over-easy eggs were cooked perfectly and the multigrain toast with extra butter and bacon were a great accompaniment - all for under $10! Our waitress was a little scatterbrained, and forgot to bring the extra butter that I asked for not once, but twice, but she was nice enough! 

Next time I'm craving breakfast and can't muster the energy to make it myself, I know where I'll be headed, especially since it's right around the corner from me :)"}
{"text":"This is a very good breakfast restaurant. Very friendly staff, good food, and very reasonably priced.  Service was fast.  Appreciated the coffee refills.  I had The Threesome (eggs, pancake, meat, fruit garnish) and was very satisfied.  The 2 Canadian sausage were good but perhaps a little undercooked on the inside.  The Boom home fries were flavourful although pretty much like French fries.  Toast was good - one slice per plate.  Decor is comfortable diner style with a mix of big and small booths and tables."}
{"text":"A very bustling breakfast restaurant that serves a wide variety of breakfast and dessert. Like a cross between Cora's and Demetre's. The food is fresh. Everything was cooked on the spot right behind you in their open kitchen. Their boom fries are very similar to pizza pizzas wedges. I liked em. 

The quantity of food you get for the price could be a bit better. 

The smoked salmon Benny was pretty good and you can't go wrong with the standard toast, sausages, and bacon.. 

Didn't like their chocolate Belgium waffles. They weren't Belgium(they were light and fluffy like normal batter waffles) and they weren't chocolate (only chocolate syrup on top) disappointed.

Even though they were busy the waitresses came by a few times to refill our coffees.

All in all an OK experience."}
