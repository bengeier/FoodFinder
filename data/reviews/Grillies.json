{"text":"I have had a change of heart! After trying what sorts of burritos other restaurants have to offer, I can confidently say that Grillies trumps them all! The sweet barbecue sauce they use to cook (re-heat really) the meat with is the absolute best!! After having that dancing on my taste buds, burritos from other places just taste like bland mush. I seriously can't get enough of it, especially paired with the pulled pork ($5.99 on Thursdays!) Since I'm still a novice concerning Mexican grub, I had much higher hopes for places which had been opened longer, ones that had thrived through the test of time (Chino Locos, Chipotle) but they all came across as just bland. True, those other places did cook the meat just right, so it wasn't as dry or as tough as what Grillies serves up, but they're also lacking in so much flavour. Grillies' sweet barbecue is seriously the bomb dot com! It's so amazing I can totally look past the overcooked meat and burnt tortillas, (through all of that, the burritos still taste amazing, how much more convincing do you need?) 
This probably isn't the biggest accolade ever, but in my opinion Grillies deserves five stars."}
{"text":"Wish we had tried this place sooner! Great food - fast, reasonable and a comfortable casual experience. Kids liked the mini-burger meals."}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this new joint in our neighbourhood in a quest to have something different than the same three places we order from.

The concept of Grillies is pretty intriguing:  they have a ridiculous selection of toppings/add-ons in a display case and you can utilize these to personalize the hell out of your meal, be it a burger, burrito, or rice entree.  I suspect this is going to be a financial handicap at some point unless they get super busy, so as a concerned person speaking to a small business, advice:  figure out which toppings make customers come back, and trim 25% of your offerings to save cash.  Also, do the potatoes warm to order.

The burgers:  amazing, homemade quality.  My husband loses his mind.

Onion rings:  meh.  Too much breading.  Clearly frozen.

The tacos:  okay.  Cheap and tasty, like having a cooler Taco Bell with better meat in the 'hood.  

The rice:  decent, if a bit odd at first.  I recc pulled pork and mango chutney on it.  t was suggested to me and yum!

I've got hope for this place.  Let's support it."}
{"text":"The food was great.  The service was friendly and helpful.  Good price range and a great place to bring friends or family groups. Plus.... you can make burritos a way you want!"}
{"text":"The food was good. The woman working there was too rushed, especially given that there were only 2 other people ahead of me and I was the last one. She spoke so quickly I couldn't understand what she said and she didn't smile at all. I'd expect poor quality service from Subway but I thought this place would be nicer."}
{"text":"Love this place for burritos, the fries are also pretty darn delicious too! I highly recommend giving it a try. Its a nice variety from the other options available nearby."}
{"text":"This place is a gem amongst the other divy spots in the neighbourhood. It is kept clean and the everything is legit fresh as you will see when ordering. My girlfriend ordered the beef tacos and said it was the best tacos she has ever had at an establishment. I had the slow cooked beef burrito and I don't know what kind of sauce they use but man oh man is it really good. I am a huge fan of Burrito Boyz but this thing gave it a run for its money without a doubt.

We plan on going by again this week to have a smoothie that is actually made with real fruit and I have to try the tacos now as my gf refused to share. The staff were also very friendly and hopefully they can open up another location near us North Toronto. If you are in the area and you want very tasty food that gives you bang for your buck check this place out."}
{"text":"Delivery took over an hour. Tacos arrived cold. They were the saddest tacos I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Love their twisted beef! Heart shaped toothpicks are way cute too! Everyone is really friendly great quality ingredients"}
{"text":"Yum!

We had the monster salad combo and a burrito delivered (quite fast too) and it was right on.  Fresh veggies and delicious fries.  As a born and raised Belgian I love my fries and these taste just like home.  Will definitely order from there again, love this new East End spot!"}
{"text":"I tried this place on the weekend after reading the Yelp reviews and found the food to be not what was advertised.  The burritos were terrible.  I opened the foil wrapper and the wrap was wet and slimy, the filling was messy and combined with the wrap just fell apart in my hand. The fries were cold not warm and the fish in the fish taco was hard.
Maybe, I had a bad cook and counter worker put it together that day.  Here I go again making excuses, I said I would be truthful when writing these reviews.

The place had a nice ambiance for a fast food place but the food was sub par.  I will not go back."}
{"text":"This is our family's go-to take out favourite! Everything we've gotten here has been fresh and yummy! We like that you can make non-traditional combos of ingredients and wind up with something both delicious and refreshing. We tell all our friends to go check it out!"}
{"text":"Grillies is a really good spot the pulled pork burger and the poutine are delicious the quality is really great, delivery is really fast."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is delicious and great value for money because the sizes are so big and good combo options. We order delivery from grillies through the just eat website a few times a month and always enjoy it. I've ate the chicken, beef and bean burittos and a fish taco - they were all filling and tasty."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the neighborhood. Grillies has modern clean interior, very nice staff and very good food.
Price's fair for better quality fast food."}
{"text":"Delicous Bouncy Fish Sea bass medium \"secret sauce\".  Generous with sauces- I had it on a plate as I am gluten-free. They have burritos that are gluten free- new to me- for next time!"}
{"text":"We ordered Crazy Salmon on salad and a chicken taco.
Both tasted good, ingredient is fresh and portion is just right as well.
Definitely wlll go back!"}
{"text":"Had this delivered once through just eat. The seasoning on it was just so strange. If you are looking for a delicious burrito that has good flavour I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"A little confused its in the Mexican category. It has pretty bad ass pouting and shakes. Didn't try the burgers but pretty much everybody else was getting them and seemed like they were regulars. Will have to come back next time I am around here."}
{"text":"My husband ordered the tacos and I ordered the burrito (shredded beef).  My husband ate them very quickly.  The burrito was large, I had half of it there and half at home.  It was amazing.  The location was clean and the staff was friendly.  I will be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"I always see this place on my way to and from work, but was a little hesitant to try it as the area always seemed a bit sketchy. After reading all the positive reviews on here though, I decided I'd give it try. I was definitely glad that I did! I ordered the daily special (which was the Big Daddy chicken burrito) and lemonade. The burrito was quite flavourful and very fresh tasting. The lemonade was incredible. I actually watched as the lemons were cut squeezed in front of me. When they say fresh lemonade, they definitely mean it. It was the perfect blend of sour and sweet, and though I had to wait a bit for it to be made, I didn't mind at all because they put a lot of work into making it perfect. The staff was friendly and the place was very clean. I will definitely be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Take out is fantastic!! Had the pork salad bowl and the beef taco as well as deep fried pickles. Still super hot when it got here. Awesome to have this option for delivery!! They're great !!"}
{"text":"I've been here two times now and if it wasn't so far from where I live I'd probably be a regular. Staff is kind and very helpful. Food is fantastic. I've had their burrito and tacos and really enjoyed both. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Good food. Staff are friendly. I often order the tacos salad, husband likes their tacos."}
{"text":"Ok, had the burgers...Awesome! Onion rings? Great! Smoothies? Actually made with fresh fruit!! Yay!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat and. Nice decor, signage. Place is clean, staff is friendly. Caring like they  like to work there.


I had the beef burger and onion rings. Onion rings were meh... I had better. Burger was tastly definitely got to be back to try the burritos.

They have daily deals which I'm going to take advantage of that for the next time.

It's right off main and danforth.... Not the best area but it's not obscure location, the area is just questionable but the food is worth it. 

I would give it 3.5 but I'm willing to round it up due to staff and service."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I came by after the gym a couple months ago with a friend. The special of the day was the steak, so I got a Black Beauty burrito. My friend got a fish and a chicken taco. There's a decent selection of choice in terms of bread, toppings and sauces, plus some paid for toppings. I got fries with my burrito (which was large enough that I could only eat about half). The fries were pretty good.

I found the price point to be good, however, the service seemed spotty. We were not attended to as well as some customers who came in after us (and from what we saw/heard they were not regulars). Also the food too a long time to be cooked considering we were the only customers they had for a good 15-20 mins.

The atmosphere is very diner like, and they even offer milkshakes on the menu, however the menu is less diner like. I feel the atmosphere and decor are a way to appeal to the neighbourhood, which could be confusing when considering the actual food that is served. Overall, a good place, but nothing I would be going out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"Seen this place on uber eats and decided to give it a try. I ordered the regular bacon cheese burger and had the cheese fries with it. Because I tried it through uber it did take a little bit of time but when it did arrive it was still warm. The burger was really good and reminded me of a nice homemade burger which tasted really good. The fries were awesome! If you are ever in the area, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Very good tacos. I had pork, chicken and beef. Pork wins hands down. You can to these as authentic or \"Taco Bell\" as you want except they did not have cilantro. 

I ordered the tacos with corn wrap vs wheat  for a more authentic version. Corn wraps are terrible if not made fresh. These were terrible.  

Otherwise, good spot for lunch in a hood that is super sketchy otherwise."}
{"text":"Been here once and had a vegetarian burrito. Really enjoyed it and love that it's conveniently located close to where I live. 

Prices are average, lots of seating, and nice decor."}
{"text":"Based on some of the other reviews below, I may decide to give it a second chance but I showed up when the place just opened and I threw out most of my plate.  I ordered tacos which consisted of some unidentified beef goop as a filling in soggy shells with a weird non-mexican kind of flavour...not cool."}
{"text":"Decided to come here to try spontaneously being in the area. My friend ordered a special of the day burrito (beef) and I got 2 tacos (1 fish + 1 bbq chicken). 
Here are the pros and cons:

Pros:
-a large variety of toppings and ingredients
-lots of food choices
-lots of seating

Cons:
-the staff here are a bit picky towards who they are social towards
-the burrito sauce is NOT the burrito sauce we are used to, it's mayo.
-food took a long time to cook
-the guac is extra :/

Overall, the food is good and considering the location it's a good choice for different variety. Was worth a try, probably will come back but not sure when."}
{"text":"Great burger spot! Ordered a couple of burgers through just eat, and we were pleasantly surprised. Burgers were really good--they grill them with a bit of BBQ sauce so the burgers have really good flavour. The toppings were nice and fresh, not too much to be sloppy, just enough. 
Onion rings tasted great. The fresh lemonade was awesome. 
Only complaint is that the burgers could stand to be a bit thicker.. 9/10 
We'll be ordering from there again!"}
{"text":"Delivery time is HORRIBLE! More than 1h30 to be delivered.... and it arrives cold!!! 
Food is good but never order at Grillies!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice interior. I didn't like the portion size on the onion rings and I didn't love the price but the burrito was a good size and the sweet bbq chicken was delicious."}
{"text":"Decent selection at a good price! My husband and I had been considering trying this place for awhile and we finally settled on going there tonight for a quick, cheap meal. And it was just that! Although, it was good quality and good service. 
I got the veggie burger combo, you get to pick all your own toppings and sauce which is nice. He got the daily special, pulled pork burrito for 5.99! 
Worth a try!"}
{"text":"This place offers daily special - you can get a burger for $4.99 or burrito for $5.99.  I came here today (Friday) and got the shredded beef special.  I opted for the burrito option.  You can make it a combo (fries and pop) for additional $2.99. 

They offer whole wheat or white burrito shell.  The options for the shredded beef were medium, spicy or bbq flavour.  They were generous on the portion of beef and I chose the spicy option.  The spice level wasn't too spicy but tasted alright.  They offer a lot of veggies such as lettuce, tomato, corn, onion, cucumber, hot banana peppers, jalopeno peppers, olives, and carrots.  They only have white rice - It's not your typical burrito rice, it's more like balsamic rice.  One thing I found unique was that they offer b beans or chick peas.  I didn't mind that option and added both beans and chickpeas in my burrito.  They have a large selection of sauce, however, if you want sauce on the side it's an additional $1.  

I really enjoy the amount of toppings they have.  I just didn't enjoy the burrito as much since it was too soaked (I had minimal sour cream, special sauce, and hot sauce in my burrito).  The special burrito of the day is definitely a bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Great vegan options!

I ordered through Just Eat and got a veggie burger (confirmed vegan by owner), fries, chickpea tacos (\"medium\" heat beans) and red kidney bean burritos (\"spicy\" heat beans).

The prices are reasonable and there are so many free toppings you can add to your burger/burrito/taco. Standard items like lettuce, tomato, onion, hot peppers, but also items like rice, potatoes and grilled vegetables.

Everything was super fresh and tasty and my note about no dairy was honoured.

Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!
I've been there and ordered from their place many times.
The staffs are an amazing group of people, always very friendly and responsive. The food is one of the best in Danforth Village. Their beef tacos are to die for. The burritos and burgers are always well-made.
[Secret tip: Whatever you take ask for a lot of spicy mayo with it, makes the food twice as better. i.e.Onion rings with spicy mayo on top.]
The place is decorated well and is always clean. 
The only minor complain I may have is having more items in the menu.
But, overall I still give it a solid 5/5."}
{"text":"Very impressed with their delivery. Unless you want pizza or Chinese, there are not a lot of delivery options in our hood. Their food is great, but their customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"Went there with my wife who wasn't hungry but I was starving.  I noticed the place was fairly new so I thought to try it.  I love Mexican food and a burrito sounded good.  Pretty nice place!  The service was a little slow and a bit unorganized but they were fairly busy so no worries.

I ordered a fish burrito and waited.  My wife walked in and said she wanted a ground beef burrito, so I ordered her one and we both customized our burritos with whatever toppings we wanted.  We finally got them and went home to eat.  AMAZING!!  My fish burrito was so good.  Best I have ever had.  I had a few bites of her ground beef burrito and it was equally good.  Definitely going back.

This was the location on Bayview Ave."}
{"text":"Good Food, Good price.
GF and i come from the gym to get our fresh burritos withe the special of the day and im surprised and pleased how good it is. 
We usualy get 2 good size burritos (im 190lbs and it stuffs me) for like 15$ after tax and its nice cuz u get to pick ur toppings and there are fresh stuff u can pick. . Also makes good lemonade. 

Con.
Only downer is the smoothies, they taste good and they make  them there but they never have certain fruits so ur limited towards 6pm ish"}
{"text":"Went here for my second time as I work in the area. My coworkers and I all enjoyed our burritos. Will try the tacos next time."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place out for sometime, as a matter of fact since it opened (it's across the street from my Canadian Tire). So tonight for dinner I gave this joint a whirl. I was so excited. It's very clean and well decorated (although plain black and red mostly). The menu is a simple one. You basically can get salmon, chicken, burger, and the like in either the form of a burger, a taco, a wrap, a burrito or the like. You can get a salad on the side (oyyyy....$3.99 for a mini salad seems pricey) or you can get fries, poutine, cheese fries, or like I've said before, the like. There's a small resemblance to that of a \"Licks\" but the staff didn't talk in a funny way. As a matter of fact the talking that did happen seemed to lack basic communication. There seemed to be some gooey-ness in the fluidity of communication. Instead of sounding like a whiner and complaining, I'll just say they seemed disorganized. I suspect one or two of the staff were in training. Will I go back is a key question, and the answer is yes! With the lack of communication, the over priced salad, the cafeteria setting, with good food and a clean setting, gives these folks a 4/5. Check it out if you're in the area. If it were not in this Neighbourhood I'd imagine they'd do better."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery a few times here. The porker burrito, usually with cheese fries too. The burrito is massive and delicious, good for 2 meals or 1 very fulfilling one haha. Staff seem friendly, if you've made a weird burrito on your online order, they'll call to confirm with you to ensure a good burrito that isn't soggy. The cheese fries are my guilty pleasure. Highly recommended for a lazy afternoon feast at home, noms."}
{"text":"Back home for a few days and I was hanging out on the Danforth. My hankering for something spicy and Grillies coincided as I was walking by. I'd never been here before, so in I came. At first glance, I was confused...it's a burger and burrito place. Not a mix I've seen before.

I perused the menu and I couldn't recall ever having a chicken and ground beef (Monster) burrito before. So, I ordered it and dove in. The burrito was aptly named, because it was monstrous, but it looked like all the burritos are, so perhaps its monstrous because it's made from a chicken cow.

The taste was decent and the price was right. Grillies seems to be a mix between In-N-Out and Chipotle."}
{"text":"Meh, very standard fare. I got the bacon cheese burger $8 with fries, coke $3. I wouldn't recommend getting the bacon, it's the microwavable stuff that ends up being burnt. The beef itself was a bit burnt on the sides as well making it medium well done. I usually prefer mily burgers medium rare but maybe that's the standard here?

Fries are regular, good if you need something to munch on. 

Staff is nice and there seems to be many in the kitchen making food even when there's only me and another table. This place is huge so there's always table space.

I've definitely had better burgers but it's good enough when you're hungry. Just skip the bacon."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and they food has always been good. From the outside I thought it was a burger joint, but was pleasantly surprised to find a burrito shop that also does burgers and fries. 

The fries and onion rings are delicious, just the right crispness, not soggy. The burritos are even better, but I think the best part is the endless amount of toppings that they offer. 

On top of all that, the staff are super polite and accommodating."}
{"text":"Large delicious portions at a great price, friendly staff, and fast delivery. Lots of toppings to pick from with no limitations either. Onion rings are still crispy when delivered. Their fish tacos are to die for!"}
{"text":"Returning to this nice little place. The ordering process is a bit confusing. Paying is almost an afterthought to the whole affair. But the food is quite good. The pork tacos with spicy sauce are nice. The fresh made to order lemonade is very good. I order half-sweet personally. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent service. Very friendly servers. Will definitely come back. And recommend it to others"}
