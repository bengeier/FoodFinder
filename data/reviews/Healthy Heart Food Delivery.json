{"text":"The food is okay..overall found it bland and they used the same sliced for all the chicken meals it seemed so it really was not the greatest. What is worse though and really the reason for the rating would be the customer service! I never received a timely response,  and Ruth and Robert really lack in making you feel like a valued customer. It tool me over a week for someone to call me back about joining (after an email and a phone call) and when I finally spoke to someone, she treated me like I was an annoyance when I was asking my questions.  Their website is not user friendly (and is why I had so many queations) and their emails were similar. So glad my 30 days is done - never again!!"}
{"text":"We are quite impressed by the variety of the food and the quality. You choose the food twice a week (2-3 servings)and it's sent in a styrofoam cooler. Food is beautifully presented and some require reheating accordingly.  The owner Jon is highly approachable and accommodating. The portion control takes a while to get used to. You get to vote your favorite and least favorite food accordingly.  We hope some of the fruits in the fruit crisps can be replaced with fresh fruits instead of canned. Also would like to see more Heart & Stroke certified menu items, high fiber options (feels like I don't take vegetables and fruits enough) and some guidance on the amount of red/white meats.  Their website is:  www.healthyheartmeals.com"}
{"text":"While I do find the foods tasting great, i have had  a few experiences with some soggy foods.  However, my rating is because the customer service friggin'  sucks,  I can never reach anyone on the phone.  I never see receipts for my purchases and nothing is ever sent over to me to look at. Call a person back or get int eh office at some point and answer calls back."}
{"text":"This plan is unhealthy. And most of the meals are just bland and fatty. They all have this similar taste which gets revolting after a few weeks. And while the calories might be geared for 2lb per week weight loss, you will be eating unhealthily- globs of mayo, fatty meats, little to no vegetables (and they get soggy after a day) little fibre, etc.   The owner is really nice and accommodating, but honestly, the product is expensive, not balanced, bland and shortly becomes repetitive."}
