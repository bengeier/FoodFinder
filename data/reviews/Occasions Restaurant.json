{"text":"Tried the restaurant for the first time. Soup was tasty and Bbq Ribs were very good and portion big. Definitely recommend the place."}
{"text":"I won't be able to fit in (or bore you with) all of the facts as to why this place is the best. My Fiance has been coming here for over 10 years and I have been coming here for about 8. The service is awesome, the food is great and the atmosphere is perfect for a casual and relaxing meal.   Anyone who complains about the food should eat here more then once. and if you have and STILL don't like it then it's just not for you so stop trying. I have had countless meals from here and have enjoyed every single one. I usually get the same 3 things so that may be why. Buffalo chicken salad is the best next to their ribs. Oh my gosh the ribs are so good.  The breakfast is also great. It isn't fancy which is why it's so great. It is like what you would cook at home only 10x better. Plus the prices are hard to beat."}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's party the other night. I like the general atmosphere, its not too bright unlike some places I have been to, the servers are friendly, and you get a decent sized portion of great-tasting food. Yay!   Just a side note, I had the chicken souvlaki dinner, and the rice that was served with it was AMAZING! I would recommend."}
{"text":"Good tzatziki and home fries and Benedict. Good prices:) I like the souvlaki dinner, it's simple but you get a ton of food. Service is always really good"}
{"text":"This is our local diner. If you live in Little India, every once in a while you want to eat food that isn't Indian. Just every once in a while. And along this strip of Gerrard, you're hard pressed to find somewhere not shilling curry.  So maybe we expect less from a restaurant which is curry-less, but we are very happy with Occasions. The food is not disappointing, but neither is it amazing. The prices are great and the service is fantastic. Seriously, the waitstaff are kind and attentive. Tip well, they deserve it.  From the menu, reliable options are the (chicken) souvlaki meals and salads. The burgers are also great - handmade and well-seasoned. Fries with gravy: yummy. They have a reasonable selection of beer on tap. The desserts, however, are probably best avoided.  The decor is unabashed 80s. When was the last time you saw so much turquoise and peach intertwined with interior lattice patterns? The 80s? Yeah, that's what I thought.  Anyway, Occasions is good but not great, and made better by the staff. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but I'm so glad it's in my neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Myself and the gf have gone here on few occasions and the food was good...but our last visit last night was the absolute worst...had fish and chips and wow...fish was over cooked mush...fries were horrible and both looked like they been in the deep fryer way too long...gf had a Greek salad and even she could not finish due to horribly put together...they have definitely lost our business...get a new cook cuz the one they got now wouldn't cut it on bar rescue Lol he sucks!!!"}
{"text":"THIS IS THE LEGENDARY SPOT OF GERRARD/COXWELL. It is exactly what you would expect from a place named 'Occassions.' It's like Cheers, but less alcoholism and more food. The bar has many regulars who drink slowly for hours and say stuff to each other every once in a while while watching whatever is on TV.  As far as the restaurant is concerned- they have the best wing deal- possibly- in the city. 2 lbs. for-- ...I don't remember the price-- but it was something that a higher end place would charge for just 1 lb. Get them suicide and baked. Great stuff. Their garlic bread is special too. Besides a couple other highlights like that, this is a charmingly mediocre joint, reliably decent all around in every way, every time.  They recently got a relatively young attractive female bartender, which I'm sure shook things up a lot for everyone in the neighbourhood. But don't get any ideas guys- she has a boyfriend.  Happy Occassioning.  ***Update: the 2 lb wing menu item has now been replaced with a 1 lb wing menu item. I am reluctantly keeping the 5-star rating."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great service for starters.  Great prices. Nice atmosphere.  Amazing garlic bread.  Very good veggie burger.  Great fries.  Nice salad.  All of my family enjoyed all of the many times we went here.  I have moved away, and I very much miss this place."}
{"text":"They have amazing ribs, wings and service. It is a hole in the wall. Prices are reasonable and I love it here. Don't be detoured from the outside. It is a lovely homely place."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant, the price is fair and dishes are really well portion, you definitely will be full and the most important is that it is tasty.  I ordered the classic 12 oz burger to go with fries and it was savory and juicy! You may say this place is similar to all the diner/bar restaurant around the neighborhood, but trust me, Occasions Restaurant is more delicious and fair for the price you pay. Lastly, there are various choices in the menu. It may take a long time for you to try everything and they have daily specials.   In conclusion, it is good!"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood secret. A old school family restaurant, they have a huge menu that varies from liver & onions to soulvaki. The brunch is really good too."}
{"text":"This was a really great family restaurant. I had the lasagna and the portion was huge and covered in a sea of melted cheese for $13. It came with a couple big hunks of garlic bread and a caesar salad. The service was fast and friendly. The server had a lot of personality. The menu had Greek, Italian, and pub fare, there really seems to be something for every taste. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"The outdoor patio is great, the beer is great. The ribs are great, the beer is great. The wings are fantastic, the beer is fantastic. Nuff said"}
{"text":"Dingy on the inside and out. I've tried time and time again to like occasions but I can't.  The food is mediocre at best. I had a french onion soup there that had no name croutons and tasted of salt and MSG. The standard bar style food. The wait staff a lot of the time are busy tending to their own children that and being babysat by a plate of fries in the booth near the service station  The wait for everything is terrible, my main reason that I don't eat here anymore is the 30-40 min turnaround on a meal. Seriously if it's going to take you that long to cook it better taste of ambrosia and come with a happy ending.  To sum it up, I don't like it, but I gave it a fair try."}
{"text":"So nice to have a great place to eat just around the corner from my home. The ribs are to die for !  But all the food is great and the staff is so friendly."}
{"text":"Not just Greek. The food is great and the prices fair.  The O's staff is super friendly and the bosses most accommodating. The can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"Great food...Atmosphere... Just had the soup of the day \"Loaded Baked Potatoe\" best soup ever....."}
{"text":"Still dingy on the outside.  After an initial first bad experience, the food quality has increased.  Eggs Benny to Greek."}
{"text":"A friend and I walked down to get take out one day.  $12.99 for 2 pounds of wings sounded like a great deal until we saw their definition of 2 pounds.  Souvlaki dinner was OK.   I'd try their Thursday (Thursday, if I recall correctly) rib special... if I was within 5 minutes of the place and had no better alternatives in mind."}
{"text":"OK - so it looks a little dingy from the outside and there are usually a few \"interesting\" characters mingling about on the street corner. The food is usually mediocre, but the starters are pretty decent. Their wings are actually pretty decent and beer is cheap!  However, if you are looking for a good greasy spoon breakfast joint to cure the weekend hangover - this is your place!"}
