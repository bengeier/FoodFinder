{"text":"Extremely disappointed by the lack of respect given to us today at the west side market. Bought salsa and a quesadilla, came to $9.50 and we paid with a $20. The girl at the counter gave us back 0.50 we said we paid with a 20 because that's literally all we had with us at that point. The girl said no you didn't. They all were very rude to us. Called the owner they gave us our change. Then they gave us our bag. But then the girl followed us around the market place and then accused us of taking food saying they gave us tamales in our bag and we didnt pay for our food. Will never recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Went there and had a Mango Margarita - it was excellent! Waitress was super nice margarita was made with fresh organic pureed mangoes!  Nice size drink- absolutely fantastic!  The way a Mango Margarita should taste! Wish I hadn't eaten before I got there cause the food looked delicious too! Was a beautiful warm day, so we sat outside on sidewalk cafe..nice!"}
{"text":"How's this for irony....We loved this place so much we don't ever want to go there again!!  No seriously, we cannot imagine them living up to our first meal there!  My husband and I went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon, and we both ordered a Torta.  It sounded all kinds of interesting with mashed potatoes and avocado and garlic aioli with chicken pounded out real thin on a chipotle bun!   The food came out piping Hot from the kitchen (something that is really important to my husband), with a side of platanos maduros (ripe plantains) that are sweet and go really well with the sandwich!! Everything was so good - we are afraid it won't live up to our own hype the next time we go!!!   The server was friendly and informative, and even the manager was attentive.  She said they will be opening a bar very soon in the restaurant. So, we will go back...and hope for the best!  In the meantime we have been telling everyone about this place - we were very impressed!!"}
{"text":"Lovely locale, friendly staff and wonderful food! The menu is very limited but the items I ordered were delightful. Oh, and did I mention how affordable it is... well it is!  The music is authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"Took some foods to go when I was in the market this weekend.  The black bean quesadilla tasted fine, but was pretty small for $4.50.  I also tried the avocado salsa, pineapple/coconut/mint salsa, and cactus/jicama/mango salad.  They all tasted ok, and were fairly priced, but weren't good enough to make me want to eat them again.  I think I'm probably done with Orale.  There are too many other things at the WSM to try."}
{"text":"My fiance and I stumbled upon Orale's looking for a filling Friday night meal. The scallops on the outside menu caught my eye and I knew I had to try them. The staff was very friendly and informative and provided excellent service. With endless salsa, some of the best Jumbo Sea Scallops I've ever had, and the Guajillo Pepper and Orange Glazed Grilled Salmon, we were left truly satisfied with our choice in dinner. The pricing was unbeatable, you can't go wrong with Jumbo Sea Scallops for $12. My fiance and I are also pretty peculiar when it comes to salmon, it was excellent and cooked wonderfully. The chef even came and introduced himself to us to ask how our meal was. We will definitely be returning here soon. Check out my photo of the Jumbo Sea Scallops, if I haven't emphasized them enough, they were fantastic!"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch an dinner and  I really enjoyed it both times. As a transplanted Texan I was glad to find some decent Mexican food. It isn't Tex Mex, but the flavors are terrific and nuanced (probably more so than Tex Mex). They have slightly different menus at different times of the day.For lunch I was with a transplanted friend from California, and she was also happy to find a place that was not only decent but really good. It is very small, but I haven't had a problem getting a seat either time. They start you off with a selection of some of their (fresh) homemade salsas. They're terrific and really interesting flavors. They are more like a pico de gallo, rather than the cooked salsas. Very fresh! Soups are really good too. They don't have a large menu, but they have a variety of choices. I'm vegetarian and they always have several selections for vegetarians. My carnivorous friends have always been satisfied as well. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Orale has a stand in the westside market, but also has a brick and mortar restaurant. They offer an excellent vegan menu on Tuesdays, and the regular menu always has a handful of vegetarian/ vegan options! Plus, you can sample a variety of salsas with your meal at no additional cost!  Orale is certainly on my Top 10 vegan-friendly place to try in Cleveland! http://veganhostess.com/vegan-cleveland-restaurants-coffee-shops-more/"}
{"text":"mmmmmm..........shredded chicken enchiladas covered in mole sauce.  only $2 and great with a small cup of joe from city roast.  the freshly made chips and large variety of salsas are some of the best in town!  but i think the mole will always be muy favorito!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see that they had tamales, but unfortunately I was disappointed. They were so dry, little to no sauce at all, and there was little meat and loads of dry corn mesa. In the end I do like everything else I tried but I was sad."}
{"text":"Went there last night by chance. The staff was awesome to say the least. Very informative, and gave great suggestion's. I lived in Phoenix for over 12 years, just moved back to Lakewood 3 years ago, and am very picky when it comes to Mexican food. Rarely have I found anything around the area that I will even go to more than once due to the fact that most restaurant's here have the whole white boy Mexican food that's a joke. This place I will be going back to atleast 2x a month, depending on my work schedule. This place is awesome. Gotta try it."}
{"text":"I love the food at Orale, but some of their staff need an attitude upgrade. If you hate your job so much, quit!  Some of the people working at this stand are lovely, but today I went there and I honestly can't say what I did wrong. The girl working was clearly complaining about me (while I was still standing there!) and it seemed she was just annoyed I existed. I probably would have gotten more than just salsa if I hadn't been itching to get out of there before I started an argument in the middle of the market...I've had bad service before, but this was different. Maybe she was having a bad day, but is that my fault?  All that aside, Orale's salsas and tortillas are all very tasty. And they're lucky they've got that going for them, or I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time dining at Orale for both my girlfriend and I. We saw good reviews so we decided to check it out. Portions were good as was the service. The food, however, was very very bland and our margaritas were weak. It was disappointing but the worst was how expensive the meal was for how little we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican with just the right amount of \"modern flair\". Do not miss out on their tortilla soup! Nice variety of fresh salsas. Chips needed a little salt..."}
{"text":"Orale = Burn my friggin' face of bliss.   We didn't grab any solid foods here today, but we went salsa crazy on the Orale stand. We're talking mango habanero salsa to top the swordfish steaks we purchased earlier from Kate's Fish. We grilled those puppies up and topped them with this fresh, slightly sweet, spicy gloriousness. The perfect taste combo... ever.   Oh, it didn't end there. We also scooped up the spiciest salsa/sauce they had there. I knew as soon as I laid my eyes on 3XX spice label that it was meant for me--and I was right. One little scoop of this fire-in-my-face deliciousness on a crunchy tortilla chip and I knew I was in trouble. Not from the spiciness, but because I knew I found my new favorite salsa.  So, enough about the amazing salsas... how about that service! We were directed to this awesome stand for great additions to grilled fish. The gal at the counter took no time what-so-ever diving right into her fav salsas for meatier fish. What a doll she was.   Honestly, even if you're just looking for a great fresh salsa and not a meal or snack, this is the spot for you. Although, I can't wait to come back and try every.single.item. I saw there--especially the marinated steaks, quesadillas, enchiladas and .... well, everything! They'll even nuke it for you so you can nibble it on-the-go!"}
{"text":"I knew about their stand in the West Side Market but never got to try any of their food so I was curious and I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised. Free chips and salsa is always a good thing at a Mexican restaurant and their salsas are as fresh as fresh can be, not to mention they have about 15 different salsas.   The meal was prepared nicely and was, once again, very fresh. You can tell this place uses their ingredients from the West Side Market. The only complaint would be the price is a little steep but for getting the fresh ingredients and inspired menu choices it's worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place. The enchiladas are only $2 a piece and so delicious!!!! They are so many to choose from. I usually get 1 of each and its always a surprise to find out what is in them. They have a large vegetarian selection too.   They have fresh cooked chips and a large selection of salsa (they will let you sample anything)   I don't think they are open on mondays?  but I'm not 100% sure.    Pefect to take as a side dish somewhere :)"}
{"text":"super tiny little joint with super informal, friendly service that makes you feel that you're eating at a friend's house......drinks are awesome, try the blood orange margarita-delicious!!!! the app prices almost equal the entree prices which is weird because you get SO much food on the plate for an entree, but the appetizers are teeny tiny.....but delicious none the less. we had the chorizo empanadas and smoked chicken taquitos for apps....both delicious but we all agreed that the taquitos were the  better of the 2. for dinner 3 of the 4 of us had tacos.....battered avocado, mahi and carne asada tacos were the 3 choices....i had the chile rubbed pork chop smothered with mushrooms and served with purple potato mashed stuffed with goat cheese. the chop was fred flintstone-esque! so huge!! we all agreed that any place else would have charged at least $30 for this pork chop compared to the meager $15 charged here.....believe me, i'm not complaining, i am happy to get away with the 15 dollar price.. we all agreed that we'd happily come back. food and service is wonderful, paintings on wall are really great and the vibe is fun and friendly......go and try this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious assortment of Mexican specialties at this little stand in the West Side Market. We opted for a pork tamale, chicken empanada, and the flank steak quesadilla - which totalled a whopping $9 and they even heated everything up for us to eat right then and there! Being a snob of Mexican food I have to say that this stuff passes the test. Give it a shot next time you're in the Market."}
{"text":"This review is for the stand inside West Side Market, although I understand there is also a full restaurant outside the market. I was really excited about trying their tamales, which looked great! Aside from them not being cooked fully, the vegetable tamale use canned veggies. Pretty gross. The chips and dip were pretty good but not remarkable by any means. Additionally, they messed the order up. Perhaps the tamales we ordered would have been better than the ones we got? I suggest visiting the West Side Market but passing on Orale..."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new restaurant and heard how W 25th St was coming around so I decided to try out this little hole in the wall restaurant based on reviews I read. Best decision ever!  This was the healthiest and most interestingly delicious Mexican food I've ever had. Each dish had a flare of other cultures tied in. My burritos had an eastern Indian flare and the combined flavors were to die for. I couldn't wait to bring another friend back which was every bit as great as the first visit. I appreciate the consistency. SO glad I stepped out of my tiny food box to explore some of what Cleveland had to offer."}
{"text":"This is my favorite stand at the West Side Market. I come here every Saturday and get some enchiladas, salsa, beans and rice, guacamole and other Mexican foods. My favorite thing to do is mix and match the salsa. The mango habanero is my favorite. Try to arrive around noon because the guac sells out quickly. I love coming home Saturday night after drinking a few beers, going into my fridge and heating up some Orale. It always prevents an ill feeling in the morning. Roberto is the man."}
