{"text":"Friendly service, great food! Very convenient. Smothered steak is excellent. Best gravy around."}
{"text":"Extremely unreliable service. Had a decently large group of hungry individuals who called ahead to get a little time with the truck in Kearney Mesa. After already being 2 hours late, we called again to get ignored phone calls, and a shady story once one of our calls finally was answered.  Rather than owning up to being late, we all were told different stories of where the truck was and why it hasn't shown up yet; A total failure to uphold their end of the agreement.  Rather than enjoying Gourmet soul food, I will be leaving disappointed and lied to by the owner and cook of Linme's Food Truck. Would not recommend to any friends."}
