{"text":"It is a nice place inside and the food is excellent.  A lot of the food is homemade.  The pricing on food is adequate, but the price on drinks for the area is high.  If you want to eat, it is a great place to go.  If you just want a drink, it is over priced.  The bar tender also waits on table, to service can be a little slow if busy."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! Stopped by when passing through and was pleasantly surprised by everything!  The food was fantastic as well as the staff.  We happened to stop in on the \"peel and eat shrimp\" day (Wednesday) and they were perfectly cooked.  I also had a buffalo chicken salad that had a lot of green and vibrant vegetables.  My friend had the grilled cheese and chicken tortilla soup and he said everything tastes fantastic - high five to the chef!  The bartender was also great, very sweet and kind! 

To boot, this place was clean and affordable! I will be back again!"}
