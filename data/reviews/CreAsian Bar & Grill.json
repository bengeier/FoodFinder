{"text":"Food is tasty, but can get the same tasting food here in the valley. 
 Difference is that they have a bar which most vietnamese restaurants don't.  BUT, bathroom is sooooo filthy!!!!  I hope they keep that sanitized and clean... For me, if restaurant bathrooms are not clean, how do you keep your kitchen..... And the fact that this place just recently opened!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Come by for Happy Hour, a drink or dine-in, whichever suits you best. The food is great, the atmosphere is fantastic and the drinks are even better. We live a mile away and now has become a regular at this place. Their pho bowl is awesome as well. I am very picky when it comes to broth & sliced beef, but they use the rib eye steak and is very tender. The aroma is also great."}
{"text":"I came in here late Sunday for a work trip and stumbled upon a local Vietnamese restaurant that was still open. The atmosphere seem like it'll be fun during summer because the restaurant had indoor and outdoor seating. I was greeted by the owner of the restaurant and quickly seated within seconds. He offered me special entrees that weren't on the menu which I was extremely excited about. I ordered two carne asada tacos and two shrimp tacos (secret menu). The orders didn't take very long to come out and while I was patiently waiting for my order both Jay and Judy converse with me and asked me about my business trip and were very pleasant. The food tasted delicious because it came with a very delightful house sauce that will have your mouth salvate. Overall, I enjoyed my experience and the food as well as service is beyond professional and friendly. Definitely give this place a try when you're in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"This place was dusty. Yes dusty. No there had been no recent haboob (dust storm) or anything else that involves dust happening in the area to explain all the dust. 

We arrived at 3:10 and saw that they had just opened. I hate being the first person to walk into an establishment right after they have just opened, but we were starving and wanted to eat. 

We walked thru the patio/bar not knowing that there is a main entrance. The employee (I want to say he is is the owner) greeted us right away and told us to pick a table. 

We sat down, he dropped off the menus, and brought us some water. We were here for pho and sadly their pho selection was small. We ended up getting one chicken and one steak and an order of the egg fried rice. 

As we sat there waiting for our food, I looked around the place. Dust was everywhere! It was even on our table and the booth. The booths are black and so the white dust is so obvious. My nose was very itchy towards the end so I wonder how much dust I inhaled. The inside was dark and it seemed more like a billiards place then a restaurant. Halsey was on repeat, and by the time we finished eating I had memorized all her songs...

Our food came out right away and the pho was piping hot. The broth is delicious!!! Again, the chicken broth was soooo good! They serve you a big ol bowl and are not skimpy with the meats and noodles. The rice was also delicious and it had a bunch of egg in it, yummy. 

Food was really good and so was the service!! 

This place definitely needs a deep cleaning though.  Or they could also advise customers to wear face masks when dining in, to avoid inhaling all the dust... They had just opened though, so I'm not sure as to why it was so dusty. 

I would definitely order to go when in the area again and when craving some great pho.

Three stars because that dust must goooooooo."}
{"text":"This establishment has showed me that the food is not only delicious, but the service can make you feel at home . Reminds me of, fresh key herb ingredients, that pair with my pho in a way that lets me enjoy, their variety of local beers. They have enhanced the apache and  terrace road corner. Definitely made a regular and im coming back for their unmatched flavors in their cuisine. Thank you J"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was great! I love how it's so close to ASU, as I came to visit a few friends from there for the summer. 

I would recommend the sizzling steak and fried rice and then spring rolls. The peanut sauce is to die for!!! SOOOO GOOD! So good

They played great music for the younger crowd since it's by ASU. 

They have a LED beer pong table (not sure how much it is to play since they just got it but looks really awesome. Great way to draw in the college students!)

The workers are very friendly and funny. 
 
It wasn't very busy when I went it and they had just opened this place a month ago but I'd forsure come back to eat here when I visit again. I'm sure my friends would come back since they're down the street. 

Ps. Draft beer is $2.50 and appetizers are $5 each from 3-7pm"}
{"text":"My favorite Pho spot, the broth doesn't need anything extra. If you don't feel like Pho, try their short ribs and shrimps. Cooked and seasoned well, left me at a food coma right after. They have a nice beer pong table and pool table. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Normally I don't bother writing reviews, but this restaurant is extremely stand out to me. The food was delicious; customer services was awesome( shout out to the owner and the bartender Jordan) . I had the grilled chicken thigh and my husband got Pho Special. The broth was incredibly tasty; he gulped it down. So do not hesitate to give it a try whenever you are around the Tempe area ;)"}
{"text":"The food is the highlight here. The atmosphere and the staff are great and fun, but the food is why you will keep coming back. All apps are $5 on happy hour and the mussels or the tacos are to die for! The Pho is amazing, best broth award. You're likely to find the owners working and they are super friendly. The bartender Jordan makes it a fun environment. Ask for a green tea shot, they are his speciality!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot! 

They just recently open and are little understaff  but the food quality is great! So expect some time delay.

Appetizers
Get the shrimp tacos for the appetizers! Definitely special for the place.
The lamb skewers were pretty tasty from my roommate said to me.

Calamari was all right and I think it was missing some flavor.

Dinner
I had the grilled and baked chicken with egg from their rice dish. This was recommended by the chef! You need to get this. It's amazing.

My roommate got the grilled pork with noodles. That was awesome as well!

Overall great food and great ambiance."}
{"text":"We moved here from Washington and by chance found this hidden jem... AMAZING FOOD!! Very orignal and delicious. Huge recommendtion is the Killa Kali Taco!!! Wont disappoint. The best happy hour ever!"}
{"text":"There are plenty of reasons to come here: great food, staff, environment, and an awesome amount of specials during Happy Hour. This was a good find, and my group and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"If you pay with card, be aware of what you are charged once the tip goes through. I picked up so I did not tip for service and they added $6 dollar tip to my bill, 36% tip!! Thank god capital one notified me on the abnormal tip amount on my account or I would not have noticed. Food was amazing but I was really disappointed in them after I noticed what they did."}
{"text":"Wow  we were impressed! The pho is pretty good! Did not taste MSG-like and was pretty flavorful without needing extra hoisin etc. the vermicelli noodle is pretty good too! Very good portion as well!! 

Just sth for the owner, mayb having the happy hour time at night instead? It's right next to ASU and ppl usually hungry while staying up late :)"}
{"text":"I love this place, they have great food. I had shrimp tacos and steak tacos, also and steak ruby with rice and  fried calamari  which is my favorite. Everything I had there was delicious. people there are super friendly and they have great customer services I love this place"}
{"text":"Great food! But why the bathrooms so filthy?  C'mon guys ... u are better than this! This is 2018 people care about this stuff."}
{"text":"Beef on the plate is great. The fried rolls are awesome. However, please keep in mind that is place is sort like *fusion* Vietnamese restaurant. The good thing is they have a bar and now 15% off, but salad and marinated veggies are not Vietnamese style at all.. it is sour and too salty. I was upset at this part since I really love Vietnamese salad and side veggies. Anyway, I give them 5-star vote because of the overall quality: a waiter, atmosphere, and of course yummy grilled beef!"}
{"text":"Came here expecting the best, but walked out feeling like I don't wanna come back again. 

My family and I came here late night because it was open late and were craving Asian food. 

We walked in and were greeted by the owner, who was very friendly and got seated right away. 

We then proceeded to order our food. My husband and I ordered:

Beef, Shrimp and Egg Roll Vermicelli Bowl - the beef had great taste! It was very flavorful and was very tender. 

CreAsian Pork Bun - the bun was soft and fluffy and again very flavorful. 

Beef Spare Ribs, Shrimp and Egg Roll Rice Plate - when they brought out the dish, they brought the rice plate out with the grilled beef not the spare ribs, so our waitress had to go back and have them make the spare ribs. Again the grilled beef and spare ribs were very flavorful. 

Grilled Mussels - it was over cooked, but was good, it just wasn't great compared to the other dishes we ordered. 

I wanted to give this place more stars but just couldn't. Our food took about 45 to an hour, even the couple sitting next to us was complaining because they were waiting for their food as well. Keep in mind it was just my family and I , the couple next to us and 2 people at the bar, so it wasn't that busy. A few other people from our party ordered and were told 45 to an hour LATER that the items they ordered were no longer available because they ran out. VERY upsetting because my cousin ordered calamari and spring rolls , waited almost an hour to be told they were out of it. Another friend of ours ordered the chicken gizzard skewers and was first told they had it available, then after 45 min he had asked if it was still coming and our waitress said yes, but he never received it. So after asking again, the waitress then said they were out of it. The worst part was they tried charging him for the chicken gizzard he NEVER got! 

The only good thing about this place is that's it's open late and the food was great. It's just the service and lack of communication that really bothered us, especially me because I'm really big on customer service. I'd give the food 4 stars, but the service 2 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing food! You should definitely come and give this place a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"2nd visit and very delicious food! Quick and friendly service and the food is full of flavor."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome! Great food, Great service! OMG, I'm Loving It! Awesome small plates and the bartender (Jordan) is the S×&t. Go there and Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Any time I go there try something different so far I Love the spicy shrimp   !!! By the way I'm not a big fan of spicy food but!!! The way they make it is Amazing, I try the steak  it was delicious, the beer it's ice cold,  I recommended this place."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! I love places that are open late and atmosphere is pretty cool. I enjoyed the pho broth plus gave me a large portion with a lot of meat for under $1O!"}
{"text":"Below average any vietnams restaurants I have been. The broth taste okay, but there is no tripe, flank, tendon available which i love the most. Also don't order the sizzling steak that's the worst steak you will ever taste. The steak is so tough, and it will ruin your appetite."}
{"text":"Great Food.  Great service.  There's a full bar, draft beer and happy hour menu.  They have a few game tables which is unique.  Also, they offer a Pho Challenge.  My recommendation is the shrimp tacos and the fried chicken thigh with fried rice and eggs."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite CreAsian I have ever been too!! The service is fast and excellent and the food is very delicious!!! When it's ready they bring it out to your table right away. Everyone that works there is so friendly and everyone is happy all the time. When you walk Inside the restaurant you immediately get a great vibe. I went here with my boyfriend and the food and service was excellent. We come to this spot all the time and have referred a lot of our family and friends and they also love this place just as much!! Definitely a 5/5 Star!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience. It was hot and stuffy inside to begin with. The music was pretty loud for 4 o'clock in the afternoon and every other track was skipping.  I'm not sure if it was a scratched CD or bad buffering, but either way it was really annoying.
Our waiter never offered us anything else to drink but water, and it had that weird metallic taste you sometimes get at restaurants here. The pork bun taco was pretty decent but had way too much chili on it.  The service was pretty lacking and we were the only ones there. They're were out of what we ordered and so we settled on the waiter's recommendation. Huge mistake. Both of the rice dishes were supposed to come with soup that we never got. Chicken still had lots of gristle and the ribs had practically no meat, and what little meat was there was so tough and gristly that it was inedible. Their fried rice also sucked. Grainy texture with no flavor except a mouthful of black pepper. 
Spent $30 on 2 rice plates and a taco appetizer and left most of it on the plate. That's the first time I think I've ever left a restaurant hungry. I would have complained to the manager but even a comped meal wouldn't entice me back."}
{"text":"I ordered the pork rice plate which came out pretty quickly. At first glance, it appears to be a great deal with shrimp, egg roll, salad, and soup included for $10. However the pork was quite tough, the egg roll tasted like the pork had turned bad, and the shrimp was really over cooked. Lastly, the salad appears to come dressed in an Italian vinaigrette which is off putting. They had forgotten to give us the bowl of soup that came with the meal but brought it out after we asked. The soup was bland and seemed to heavily rely on one spice (star anise?). Overall would rate this 3/5 bc it is a good amount of food that you receive, just not very tasty food.

P.s. I agree with the reviewer that said Halsey was playing nonstop!"}
{"text":"One of the best, authentic and delicious Vietnamese restaurant in Arizona. Hands down  Expect to always be impress and full leaving CreAsian! I absolutely adore this place, from their mouth-watering food and top notch customer service will make you want to come back for more. I have came back every single day and will continue because it is truly THAT AMAZING.!! There is nothing bad about this place and I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Great pho with real authentic flavors! Staff is amazing and will definitely be coming back with my friends!"}
{"text":"Three stars for now because we apparently came in on a bad day. We sat at tjr bat (as we do everywhere we go) and when we went to order our drinks the bartender there let us know that she is not actually a bartender but filling in for someone who either called out or no showed for their shift. The woman was super nice, did not know how to make any drinks but I don't blame her. It took a long time foe our food to actually arrive to us. The sticky buns were flavored very well and spicy, but the bun itself was overcooked. The baby back boar ribs were good, BUT there was hardly any meat on them. Some bones you couldnt get anything off of them. The pho was good. Not the best I've had but I did enjoy it. I will be trying this place again (I really need to try the kabobs). I'm assuming I just came in on a bad day, because I can feel the potential this place has."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, wonderful specials, big menu (all very delicious) all around nice trip! Talk to the owner his name jay and ask about the deep eddy special!!!! Will not let you down ?"}
{"text":"I have order the Pho Tai and it was absolutely delicious! I ordered it 2 times in a row on different occasions and still got the same great taste!  My bf got the owners choice of beef ribs with rice and he loved it! We came here 2 times and the place was way better than before! The owner added a pool table, beer pong table and a hockey game table. I absolutely love the food and environment here."}
{"text":"Me and my husband came to visit Arizona and decided to get some pho and we're so glad we came here! We live near San Antonio, TX and have had our fair share of pho throughout the years. To be super honest, this was hands down the best pho we've ever had! The owner is super nice and attentive, he made us feel very welcomed and made it a great experience! If we visit Arizona in the future we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service at Creasian is amazing! Owner/manager is always there to make sure your meal is good to go. Menu is diverse and food is excellent. I got the calamari and special pho (which were both good) , but I was eying some of the more exquisite options for another time.

Atmosphere is pretty unique as well. There's a bar, karaoke and a \"beer pong\" table."}
{"text":"I was referred to this place by a friend of mine and I'm glad I went. Not only is the place clean and has a nice arrangement but the wings are AMMMAZING. I am a very picky eater but this place did not disappoint. I'm going to recommend this place to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Great Food. Fun Hangout.  Many beers on tap and great drinks. Happy Hour Skewers and drinks is a good place to start.  The Pho and Rice Plates finish you off"}
{"text":"If you're on the lookout for some good Pho in Tempe this is the place to go to. If not this is still the place to go ! They have some awesome dishes and the owner is very friendly and helpful. Prices are reasonable and you couldn't ask for better Happy hour drinks & food . Give this place a try it's new and worth your visit!"}
