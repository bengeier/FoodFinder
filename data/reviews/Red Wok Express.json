{"text":"Whoever thinks this place is not great are just a bunch of weenies that want to spend $10 and get a 5 star restaurant service . This place is amazing and the food is delicious and the employees are really nice! I recommend this place to anyone. They fill your plates more than Panda Express and the food is A1  My favorite place to get fast food for the same price as Panda Express. Overall place is clean , service is amazing , food is delicious"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place. Wish I hadn't, I won't be back. They are just like panda express, except the food is terrible including the salad bar."}
{"text":"Food was way too oily. Over priced and small portions. Got pretty sick from all the oil."}
{"text":"First time here this may the best orange chicken I've ever eaten.  They have a all you can eat deal 799. Come up for as many entrees you can eat. Panda Express style food layout. Also the mixed veg and spicy beef were awesome. We will definitely be back.  The thing that keeps it from being a five is confusing menu board. And a larger selection or more variable. Less chicken more other stuff lol. Staff very friendly"}
{"text":"First of all I love the prices! I believe it is a fair price for what you're getting. I got the buffet price which was basically $8,(just a single plate was $6.something) and, well, I got full with the first plate but I took advantage of my buffet and got the little fried breads with sugar, along with some cream puffs. The cream puffs were one of the best I've ever tasted! I fell in love. 
The overall taste was pretty satisfying for my Chinese food craving. It was pretty heavy so take your time when eating. 

Also if you dine in you get a free salad bar which is pretty legit. If I remember correctly it had Jello, fruits, various dressing, etc. I can't fully remember.

The place is super clean with many seating options. Menu is self explanatory, with smiling employees :)"}
{"text":"Food was AMAZINGLY DELIOUS !!! Also you get a lot of food for a good price . Its way better then panda . This is our new spot to . I got the coconut shrimp and it was so good . The orange chicken was juicy and had alot of flavor the rice was good as well . We got a lot for only 22$ 3 big meals ."}
{"text":"First time here and their serving size is hugeeee!!! You definitely get your money's worth. They let me sample any chicken I want and they are all pretty delicious! I got BBQ chicken and spicy beef!! Really good and I would recommend it"}
{"text":"This is the first all-you-can-eat steam table takeout Chinese food place I've ever been to. And I have to say the experience was interesting. Forget about getting enough of your favorite dish!  You can have as much as you want.

The food itself consisted of all the standard offerings you find at a Chinese food place like this: chow mein, rice, broccoli beef, orange chicken, Kung Pao chicken, and the like. The food was all pretty good.

Another cool part is that they offer and all you can eat salad bar when you dine in that has salad (obviously), fruit, and a few other healthier options.

The restaurant itself was clean and looked new. They have a big screen TV which happens to be excellent for watching Monday Night Football. I I enjoyed some of the game as I devoured many portions of food. The bathrooms were also clean and we're in good working order.

 Overall if I lived nearby, I would probably go here all the time for fast food Chinese."}
{"text":"Was hungry during my lunch break and wanted something quick and cheap.
 
That's exactly what I got. 

I ordered chow mein, Kung pao chicken, and spicy chicken. We also got some donuts on the side and crab wontons. 
Their noodles were over cooked, the chicken was pretty tender and spicy which was a pleasant surprise. The donuts were hard and had an old taste. The wontons were pretty decent but also a little hard as if they were left out too long.

I was unable to try their all you can eat salad bar because there was no utensils. Besides that the potions are really big and it's not too much stress on the budget."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! The people are super nice. I always use the drive thru and the portions are great! I love it!"}
{"text":"Don't go here.  1st time pull up thru drive thru they tell me to wait..  No one else in drive thru..... Finally come back order pay... And wait there is noooo one else here I can c inside no one inside.. what am I waiting for?  1st time here and last time"}
{"text":"This was our first time since it opened just a few months ago very pleased with the greeting we heard as we walked through the door the buffet setup very nice looking I feel we got way more than we could eat staff was very friendly we will return again because of the food, the staff, and most because of the  reasonable prices for what you get"}
{"text":"First time here. This place has a very warm atmosphere. They treat you like family. Great customer service. They give you a huge serving for your money. They let you try different things with no complaints. This is now my only place to get Chinese food. Taste great !!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place, decided to grab a quick lunch after running into Walmart. Prices are good and holy crap the amount of food they give you! $18 and some change for 2 meals, fried rice and lo mein with mixed veggies, 2 spring rolls, 2 donuts. Very good deal. Taste is ok, I have had much better in the flavor department. But this is still good for a fast food Chinese place."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot to get Chinese food. A little cheaper than Panda Express. But they don't skip out on portion sizes like Panda Express. You are very hungry but don't like the big lines at other places, they got you covered."}
{"text":"Came here here for a late night dinner. The food was ok for the price of 7.99 for all you can eat. They serve you what you want and if you want more you just go back up. They also have a salad bar that includes some sweet items that you may serve your self. The kids loved it which was a plus and the staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"Ehhhh.  Same as Panda but sides cost more. Orange chicken IS better than Panda but that is it."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place last night for the first time. My wife got the noodles with orange chicken and spring rolls, I got the fried rice and double coconut shrimp. First thing I notice is the serving area is clean, the steam from the warmer, and the portions are huge! I went out on  a limb and ordered double coconut shrimp and fried rice without sampling and headed home with my to go order. My choice was definitely the right one, the shrimp was cooked to perfection! Most places the shrimp is always over cooked and has a rubbery consistency, but this was tender. The coating still had a crisp to it with the creamy sauce on it. I personally highly recommend Red Wok over the \"other place\" across the road."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been here. I waited to give a review. Wanted to see if consistent. It has been. I've ate in the buffet in the restaurant and done Drive through twice. Pleased with eat in experience. $7.99 for the good food is a win. Great customer service too. 
The other two times I used the drive through. Pleased with portion and quality of the food. Price and flavor compared to panda, this wins hands down."}
{"text":"Came in to try this place, wish I didn't . The staff is friendly , but the food is less then desirable. Definitely won't be recommending this place to anyone..beware!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try based on a family recommendation and wasn't disappointed. For less then the price of Panda you get to go back up as many times as you like. You will not leave this place hungry!!

Only 4 stars because I didn't care for the fried rice. Need to look at the recipe. Orange chicken was delicious."}
{"text":"FIRST TIMERS!!!

We had a great experience at the Red Wok today. In terms of price, a to go box is about the same price as Panda, but the $7.99 buffet price was great! You are saving more than half of the price at Lin's Buffet and the food was MUCH better and less questionable. 

We had the honey chicken, barbecue chicken, orange chicken, fried rice, chow mien, and crab puffs. That was all flavorful and delicious.

Questionable items: mushroom chicken was a little mushy...

A cool factor is that you have access to a salad bar with every dine in purchase!

We would totally come here again!"}
{"text":"The food is always good, the customer service is always excellent. What more could a shameless fat girl ask for?"}
{"text":"Very large portions.. Salad bar is basic.. similar to Pandas .. Food was Good.. Hot and Fresh.. very friendly.. you leave Full .."}
{"text":"The food was generic, and to say the least, I had an unpleasant trip to the restroom shortly after eating here that provides enough reason to never come back."}
{"text":"Do you like large quantities of inexpensive Chinese food? Come here right away!

Goodness gracious, are you really going to read a review about fast food? Nerd.

As documented in previous reviews, I discovered last summer that many all-you-can-eat Chinese buffets offer to-go boxes. That way, I can enjoy buffets without *being seen* as the type of person who does. 

Your secret is safe with me. 

Anyway, Red Wok is a buffet, *but* more importantly, you can just pick anything up via drive-through! For less than seven bucks, I got a bowl of coconut shrimp over some chow mein (I will concede the fried rice is better), which was way, way too much for me to finish. Customers can get a two or even three entree plate of some rather typical items like terriyaki chicken, which I promptly inhaled. 

Please use the buddy system if you want hope finishing anything here by yourself. 

Also, I may make like 4 side orders of crab puffs, because they are better than like 90% of other Chinese places in the valley. 

There is literally nothing else I visit this plaza for."}
{"text":"My husband picked up dinner to go here last night.  He came home with a ton of food! Huge portions don't even begin to describe it.  Heaping servings of noodles and meat both. I had spring rolls and they weren't oily/greasy like can be found at Panda.  The food doesn't taste processed (though I'm sure it is) which is a step above Panda as well.

After reading mixed reviews on the orange chicken I was apprehensive on trying it, but got it anyway - how can you screw up orange chicken right?  I will agree it is different than Panda, but not in a bad way.  You get more chicken than breading, and the flavor is a bit lighter which seems to be the polar opposite of Panda also.

All in all, I'll try this place again.  I'll get a bowl instead of a plate though since I couldn't even come close to finishing my meal!  It's cheaper, closer, and faster than Panda - and they've got a drive through.  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try. There was a lady in front of us who was really annoying. She was very indecisive, kept walking around us, pointing at different items to ask about, and just holding up the line. She really tested my patience. Got the 2 entree plate with half fried rice, half noodles, orange chicken, and teriyaki chicken. It was a ton of food! They really pile it on there. The fried rice was different from Panda's... smaller grains, no egg, and has onion in it. It was okay. I liked the noodles. I didn't care for the orange chicken. The flavor of the sauce was very understated and I didn't really like it. The teriyaki chicken was pretty good though. I had a lot of food left over, but I didn't think it was worth taking a to-go box so it went in the trash. While it wasn't horrible, I don't really see a need to return."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, overall clean, tasty but nothing to ogle over, higher table tops which are amazing for someone tall like me."}
{"text":"Really delicious and giant portions! Had to take out half, and I don't usually do that! Definitely a good choice for fast food Chinese, and a lot cheaper than Panda Express."}
{"text":"Food doesn't look good or fast food. SO OILY. Cold and no taste. Please don't waste your money here. Thought I'd give them a try again but disappointed"}
{"text":"This places closes much earlier than advertised. Supposed to close at 11pm, but when I drove up at 10:25pm, they were already shut down--food put away, chairs on tables, lights off, and the workers lounging outside in the parking lot smoking and joking. When I asked them if they stay open to 11pm like the sign says, they just shrugged and said it was getting late. I could understand if it were 10:55, but it wasn't even 10:30 yet. This happened twice."}
{"text":"I'm a Chinese kind of guy I've tried many places and they place here is the worst Chinese food ever! I had the buffet and tried a few items. I had a few bites and I was disgusted. Never again!! Don't waste your time coming here."}
