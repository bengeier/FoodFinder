{"text":"This was my first sheesha joint in Canada. Was craving sheesha and ended up going to Mazaj. Could not believe I was in Toronto. Lovely ambiance, good service and good sheesha. Will recommend to all to try the place."}
{"text":"The manager named Mohamed was not pleasant. He did not make eye contact or even look happy to be doing his job. He was also rushing us out 15 minutes before closing. He delivered poor customer service which is why I do not plan on going back. Although, I met two friendly servers who compensated for the manager's incompetence. The location of this place is sketchy and uninviting. I was also not impressed by having to line up to pay for my bill at the end my rushed shisha session. This place needs more shisha flavors and legit Khalil Mamoon pipes. As a result, I will never come back and I will continue going to HAZE."}
{"text":"This is the #1 shisha spot in Mississauga.

Atmosphere is friendly, casual and fun! Good is well above average for a lounge. And the service is fast and courteous. 

If you're here on the weekends be prepared for a line-up because it's no secret that this is THE spot to chill with your squad. 

And the shisha is as good in Mississauga. Very consistent."}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! Great crowd! Perfect to hang with friends, weekdays and weeknights."}
{"text":"One of the bestest places for pretty much everything. You want sheesha, want to grab a good late night meal, meet up with friends, celebrate a birthday, or an after party for your engagement nikkah or wedding. Mazaj is your place to go. Ive been coming here for years now. The only place where even the owners know your name. And address you by it. A few of the many highlights. 

Sheesha 5 stars. 
Service 5 stars.
Value for money 5 stars.
Quality of food 5 stars.

In short it's my go to place for everything. Try it out soon it will be yours too. :)"}
{"text":"This place is great.

My friends and I come here every other week. The service is great.

I just wish they would add more shisha flavours to their menu because really if they expect to compete  with other hookha lounges they need to start increasing the variety of shisha flavours.

Other than that the food is amazing and the milk shakes are just as good."}
{"text":"Out of respect for your great customer service and being a guest in your establishment I did not want to lose my cool.  Please do not allow this disrespectful behavior to happen again.  I approached your employees to take action and they informed me this is not the first time these guys did this and they went about their business.

Either I am at fault for not confronting them directly, or you care about losing ignorant clients like this.  Everyone was staring at them and no one said anything.  If there is one thing your employees could do to respect other cultures, it would have been to place your place mats on the prayer mat in respect for the Ka'aba they are throwing their cards on. Your employees approach all guests to see if they need anything EVERY 10 minutes and yet they allowed this to continue on more than one occasion as I was informed.

I posted this here since they removed my comments off their facebook page without showing any interest / acknowledgement."}
{"text":"Got there and the house staff forgot my reservation after I called 3 times to confirm they still messed it up and it was a surprise birthday -_-

took me 20 minutes to fix everything and they tried to kick us out early while everyone was eating
-_-

food was good 
SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE"}
{"text":"Let spot out one weakness. Because the lounge is so busy, the workers forget what the customers ask for. HOWEVER, the service can also be excellent, so its inconsistent. 
I loved the food (Mazaj burger is delicious), I loved the sheesha, it came just on time from when we ordered (10-15 mins). Even while ramadan, we told our server that we are fasting (at Ifthaar time), he immediately brought us complimentary water bottles, and dates. I really appreciated that.  
I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. BEST SHISHA LOUNGE IN MISSISSAUGA AREA! :)"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and i frequent this place at least once a week. It's always crowded but worth the wait. We like to grab a mazaj plate to share which is huge. If I don't have dinner I like to have a mango shake which is really good. The games are great and the hookah is good too. The servers and owner know our names by now and their all great guys. Basically just a great place to chill out and have fun. The prices are affordable too. Dinner plus hookah usually costs us 50 dollars."}
{"text":"Best Shesha u can find! Friendly knowledgeable staff. Service is fast! 
No matter how busy you'll find a table. The staff doesn't forget about you after you sit. Prices are fair especially the awesome shesha!"}
{"text":"Best Sheesha place in town. I don't smoke sheesha but I love this place. Very good food, good service and its cheap! The staff are very nice and has a lively atmosphere. Check out their desert section. Their fries are bomb too!"}
{"text":"On a Monday night at around 11pm this place was packed! You get seated promptly on arrival and the waiter is friendly and attentive. We ordered one Blue Mist shisha which is a blueberry mint flavour. Shisha goes for about $11.50 each. 

We also ordered 2 teas. One black and one cardamom/mint. Typical tea, nothing extraordinary- I think it's the Ahmad Tea brand which we drink at home as well. The shisha comes with 2-3 coals which they replace as you use them. 

I really liked that they have a bunch of games including cards which you can play at your table. 

FYI the bill isn't brought to the table. You pay at the front when you're ready."}
{"text":"Love this place, I came here for the shisha but ended up getting a wrap and a waffle. Both were much better than my expectations, in fact delicious because usually food at shisha places sucks.The atmosphere is great for those looking to go somewhere with a younger vibe."}
{"text":"Probably the best place to chill and have  sheesha in Mississauga.   (Hence my four star review). 

Sheesha: if you want thick smoke, get the mint or gum mint. Their blue mist sheesha is a fruity/minty mix. It's 2 bucks more and I guess it's worth one try, but I wouldn't get it every time.

Food: it's your basic (almost below average) Mediterranean food. Nothing special here. I've tried the shawarma platters and sandwiches. Additionally, the chicken is always a little sour tasting here; not fond of the seasoning they use on the chicken. Not completely fond of their poutine either. Then again, this place isn't about super good food, it's about the experience.

Atmosphere: the waiters (most of them) are pretty cool- they don't treat you like they are better than everyone else (unlike other sheesha places like Haze). I like how they have plenty of games and cards, and that I feel very comfortable being there. (They are free of charge unlike Haze). 

Get there a little early to avoid lines on weekends. Had to wait about on hour last night for a party of five, which isn't bad considering where we were in line."}
{"text":"I am not a Shisha smoker myself so I can only speak of the set up and food here, which I found to be the best in Toronto so far. You can play chess, poker, playstation or enjoy a classic friend gathering here."}
{"text":"I had to leave a review because of how often me and my best friend talk about this place. Nothing but praise. I LOVE the ambiance!! The people that come here are friendly and willing to chat with you. It's a chill, relaxed environment... But it's very lively at the same time. When I went, it was PACKED! The only downside I guess would be the line up to get in. But that can be solved; come before 1am and you're bound to have a fun night!!"}
{"text":"Went there with a group of friends on a Friday night.

Quite busy, with a great atmosphere.

Great for groups that just want to find a place to kick it.

They do not serve alcohol so I would recommend not coming here if you are looking for drinks. 

The food was great, and the service was top notch."}
{"text":"Best hookah spot in the middle of nowhere of sauga and brampton side. Food is reasonably priced and tasty , this place is booming in the middle of the day on a tuesday to saturday night so plan your events ahead of time. Hookah service is good and have many flavours . Their service is really good too."}
{"text":"Great place to have amazing sheesha. No head rush, clean fresh flavours. Food is great too. Too long of a line up so have to wait atleast 30 minutes every time."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and it was PACKED!
Every single table was taken. 
What I like about this place is the variety of delicious food. What I don't like about this place is how crowded and busy it gets. 

Customer service is great though, so I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Upside: Quality sheesha, nice environment and very reasonable prices!

Downside: It's always crowded like most sheesha joints in Mississauga but that's expected

Lines go by fast and you can get seated relatively fast. Also the smaller your group the easier it is to get you seated (another obvious)"}
{"text":"There is a reason why I keep going there on almost weekly basis (& I drive from DT Toronto to get to it)
Great Shisha and entertainment lounge.
We usually spend several hours smoking and playing cards.
Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"One of the worst experience in my entire life. My girlfriend asked for coke and the f***ing server in reply tried to talk dirty to her mentioning co** ever time. The manager however tried to compensate by saying,\"he is our old employee please don't exaggerate things. We are sorry.\" I am one of their regular customers, have dinned there thousands of times and the same guy has served me before. I feel sorry for the owners who run this place with such unethical people. This kind of behaviour is just unacceptable! I'll never be back for sure."}
{"text":"Not the best shisha, but definitely a five star customer service and enviroment."}
{"text":"One of the best sheesha places I've been to in Mississauga. Good sheesha, good food,  ice crowd, and upscale location with lots of screens playing current sports channels and local events. Great place to hang out and play some janga and so some
Sheesha or hookah as some would call it. The food was also amazing."}
{"text":"My cousins and I came here last night for a fun chill night and that is what we got! The atmosphere is very social and the staff is friendly. We ordered 1 hookah for 3 of us and bought the flavor blue mist (blueberry mint). The flavor was very refreshing and the hookah hit well. It wasn't too harsh which I always like. My cousin and I ordered black tea and they give a nice big glass of it. 

Overall a good experience and I would come back here."}
{"text":"What a great place to hang out!!!
 A paradise for Shisha lovers... lots of games to play... and great staff to assist!! 
This is going to be on top of list!!!"}
{"text":"Ended up here after reading some of the reviews here. And glad we did. Hidden in a commercial area, this place has great service, reasonably priced and has a good flow of traffic. Music, good vibe, good desserts and above all, good sheesha. What else do you want. And cause it was my bday, they gave a free treat with a bday song blasting from the speakers. Good times!!
The crepes, mazaj sheesha, gum sheesha and pot of tea, all good."}
{"text":"My go-to shisha place in all of Mississauga. More than that, my go-to place to catch up with my group of friends once a month. If you're going on a weekend, make sure to either reserve seating or come a little early as the line-ups can get ridiculously long sometimes - which goes to show how popular this place for many reasons! The shisha itself is great, but the food is even better! Huge, delicious portion sizes and unbeatable prices. Love it!"}
{"text":"AAAMMMAZZZZZINGG! Best service on this earth, shisha is okay but omg line ups are crazy!  Go around 5 6ish, theres some space otherwise u are looking at long waits and line up. I go there almost every week!"}
{"text":"What a great sheesha lounge! I must make a few comments up front! They have some of the best service I've ever had in a restaurant. By far. 

Second: the Arabic coffee is delicious! 

Alright actual review, I got lucky with getting a table right away, I fully expected a line and within 20 min of us sitting down the place was full. Got the sheesha within a couple. Quite good. The charcoal does burn quick though, maybe I've learnt how to use it better! 

The food, fries super delicious, the wings (Cajun and Buffalo) meh as was the mango shake. But there was another cocktail (I've forgotten the name:( ) with fresh strawberries/banana's/mango... That was delicious! Like I said before the Arabic coffee was amazing! I had it medium sugar level. 

Lastly the ambience, it was a bit too bright for what I'd have liked in a hookah lounge and the music was different but hey, small prices! All in all def a visit!"}
{"text":"Home away from home, literally, with the frequency I go there.
Friendly staff, good food, loud birthday reminders!
Lots of competition opening up, it'll be good to see what they come up with to retain customers! :)
Their hookah is very competitively priced and the wait times can be long sometimes but it's worth the wait as they have really good customer service."}
{"text":"We had made reservations for 15 people for dinner. Interestingly enough, it was PACKED when we got there, and they squeezed us all onto a couch which didn't even fit us, and I think only 10 people showed up. Not sure what they would have done if we had all 15. Not to mention, it's REALLY hard to have 10 people eating meals on a tiny shared coffee table. Also this place gave me a major headache from all the shisha smoke, and men wearing cologne. It seemed WAY over packed, and unsafe by safety standards. And it's really unfortunate, because the burger I had was actually one of the best burgers I've had in the GTA."}
{"text":"Mazaj is great place for the weekend but there are couple drawback:
The wait time is usually 25-40 minutes which isn't something the management can do anything about since they are so popular 
When they are busy, the sheesha quality and food quality usually drop; possibly because they rush through. One time my wings were almost raw 

However, the staff is always very nice and the ambiance is great. Their deserts are also very good for the price."}
{"text":"Best place is GTA. Been a fan since day one. Love the food and great atmosphere. Customer service is a huge issue for many other hookah places but Mazaj has great customer service. I do want to recommend the Mazaj Burger. It's juicy and delicious. The sheesha is by far the best I've had in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is incredibly friendly and everything about this place is great. Economical. Sheesha is good. Get the special to get an iced pipe. Very economical too. Food is great too - their humus, chicken, the Mazaaj burger and FRIES are top 4. The birthday song is a highlight for me. Make sure you tell them if you're celebrating a birthday. If you plan to get the lava cake, make sure you tell as soon as you get there that you plan to have one. They run out. Also helps if you make a reservation by 7. They stop taking them after that. The wait could sometimes be long but they do their best to get you seated. Go there now!"}
{"text":"Best sheesha place in town. Always full and waiting time may be even 30 mins on weekends. The Mazaj mix sheesha is the best but is rarely available. 

The food is average. The nachos were plain Tostitos chips and cheese, beans and pickle thrown together in the microwave. The falafel burger is decent but it's accompanied by amazing fries. They have a good chocolate lava cake.

In all a crowded place with good sheesha but it's a bit too far from downtown and located outta nowhere."}
{"text":"Great shisha and the food was good as well! We truly Enjoyed the environment and the service. Thanks Bilal for being an amazing waiter  will come back soon"}
