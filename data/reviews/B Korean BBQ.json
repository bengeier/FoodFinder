{"text":"Pure chance that I found this place. I was wandering around on a break from work, this place had the nicest food pictures on display so I went for it. Immediately in love. Their menu looked pretty reasonably priced, I got spicy chicken and it came to $13 with tax. After a few minutes Moon (the incredibly personable host) rolled out a cart loaded with food. For $13 the table was completely full. 5 or 6 sides (refills seem to be free) and an absolutely massive skillet full of chicken, zucchini, peppers, mushrooms. Possibly the best meal I've ever had in Toronto, and again, copious amounts of everything. In the next few weeks they're added sushi to their menu and getting wi-fi setup. I'm having trouble articulating what a great place this is. Seek it out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was very quiet when i went in, we were the only group, though we did go in during a week day. The service isn't bad and the menu was good. There were a lot of choices and the prices were average. I ordered a pork bone soup and i really liked it. I went with other people who all liked their food. They serve Japanese food, my sister got a bento box and my brother got udon noodles. So if you want a variety, this is a good place to check out."}
{"text":"been to this place over ten times, I guess? tried alot of different items at this place, and now they are in the process of adding some new items on to the menu to become a bar / Korean Fried Chicken place?  (still haven't seen the menu changes or any new wall display yet. but they have some poster and such of a \"chicken club\" or \"C club\" with some grilled chicken or grilled wings with a nice cool black background)  if it's your first time here, you should order the osam bulgogi, which is a pork & squid stir-fried plate. (refer to the different pictures that I have on) it's great tasting, not too spicy (actually I would like it to be a bit more spicy), it's really flavourful.  if it's a cold day, should go for the soups or the hot stone bowl bibimbap. the hot stone bowl was hot enough to get the rice brown to create the rice crackling(?), and keeps the rice warm till the very last spoonful. the vegetables mixture are pretty good selection for the bibimbap.  since I have been to this place for so many times, I can see that now they really get the control of the side dishes, they are now evolve to like most Korean restaurant that they have a small plate of salad with the citrus & soy sauce, but one interesting twist is that they put celery in it. It gaves the salad a bit of zing. The side dishes (banchan) and main dish should easily fills you up, and they would ask you as soon as they see you finished your side dishes and offer you more.  Overall, this is my number 1 place for a Korean lunch."}
{"text":"This place is an 'upgraded' version of the old Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu. And by that, I mean the new owner added other Korean dishes while keeping the same soup menu. Another plus side is that they have an interesting AYCE BBQ menu.  The Korean cuisine list is similar to any other stores. However the AYCE BBQ menu consists of 4 different types of meat: Pork Belly, Pork Neck, Bulgogi, and Beef. The meal comes with free soup and pop/beer/soju for EACH person! And you can choose to eat 2 or more types of meat if you ordered to eat the higher price dish. In example, if you choose to have Pork Neck, you can also eat Pork Belly. If you choose Beef (the highest price), you can eat all 4 meats. Makes sense? :)  Aside from the good food, the owner is a nice lady; she gave our group free rice cake and pancake whenever we go there. So if you are sick of Korean Grill House and want to experience good food and service for an affordable price, give this place a try!  P/S: This place is quite busy after 7PM."}
{"text":"Food 3/5 normal taste but portions are small.   Service 5/5: friendly. Place is quite and light.  Price 3/5 $40 for two for lunch.   Nothing special. Will Not be back."}
