{"text":"Service was HORRIBLE!  We went for lunch, asked for seperate bills when the reso was made, when we sat down and AGAIN when she brought the bill with everything on the same bill. We reminded her we asked for seperate bills and she rolled her eyes and told us we should have asked earlier and it would take too long. REALLY????  It took 1.5 hours for lunch - there were eight of us but six people asked for the same thing. A pulled pork sandwich with fries. How hard is that? She did not offer us refills on water or pop or even notice when glasses were empty. No condiments were brought until we asked.  I asked for the remaining half of my meal to be wrapped and excused myself to use the washroom - she took my plate and threw out the meal. When she returned and my fellow diners asked for the take out she said she forgot and threw it out.   Terrible service, mediocre food."}
{"text":"This is probably my 5th or 6th visit. Very cramped. No space to put things down on table (our group of 4). Some items not available on menu. Salads very small for value. Food is just ok. No really good vegan, vegetarian, gluten free option. For a busy area of Toronto, this really underwhelms. New (clean) menus would be a good idea. They pack people in here like sardines.  Go here for quick convenience but I won't plan a gathering here again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 15 times, it's close to work and sometimes I am too lazy to venture out too far for an after work dinner or a lunch with a coworker.  I tried multiple dishes here (salmon sandwich, club sandwich, pizza,  mussels and fries,  Rotisserie chicken)  I would rate everything I tried as good with the exception of the Salmon Sandwich which was excellent. The biggest issue is the layout of the tables, they are way too close to each other, it can be very uncomfortable and awkward eating there sometimes if it's crowded."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times as I work in the building. The food isn't bad, but it's not memorable either. However, the service is disastrous. The servers give off the attitude that you're interrupting their day by being there. Bread often not offered until you remind them as you see it at other tables. They bring out food separately from your companions. This place has a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Food = 1 star.  Service = 2 stars. Location (overlooking Bay and Manulife Cineplex = 3 or 4 stars.  Not sure if the math adds-up, but neither did brunch. The window seating area is sunny and provides great people watching, but it's too-close-for-comfort. The back seating area is a little claustrophobic. Service was ok/ish.  Brunch stuff was average but many meat offerings were dry. Would rather get my bistro on at La Société (worth the extra $ and 1 block walk)."}
{"text":"Bloor Street Diner @55 Bloor Street  I don't recommend going. For those who know me, you know that I'm really upset when I list things. So here is my list of complaints...  1. If their food is worth $30, then street meat, instant noodles and McDonalds should raise their prices. #foodsucks  2. I ordered the Fixed Price menu with Bavette Steak. It was 4 small strips of meat and the waiter never asked how I wanted it. I should have just gone to the Keg - about the same price, but huge quality difference.  3. They forgot to give me my dessert. But after my friend begged me to take his and I tried it, I decided to pass. The waiter didn't even notice I didn't get my full meal.   4. Birthday girl ordered Salmon. She was served steak. Waiter took the dish back only to come back out to say the order was a \"salmon cut steak\". Instead of just replacing the order and apologizing for the misunderstanding, he was actually planning on serving it to her.   5. Birthday girl's dinner came out, and the waitress dropped some sauce on her new jacket. Her response \"I just dropped a little. It should come off.\"  6. Waiters kept forgetting who ordered what even though we didn't move from our seats.  7. Dessert was served without spoons for good 10mins until we got his attention.  8. They brought out the birthday cake and waived the plating fee. Then proceeded to hand out plates without cake on it and the birthday girl was cutting it herself. So... what is the plating fee anyways?   9. Friends were disappointed with their orders too. Mussels were overcooked. Chicken was dry. And pasta was bland.  10. Waiter never refilled our water, asked how our meals were or if we wanted another drink."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with the food quality.  I had the Caesar salad and the dressing tasted bland and like plain mayonnaise.  Croutons looked like they were out of a cheap package.   The wine list carries wines from the LCBO with a 200%+ markup.  eg. Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc is about $20 (was on sale for $16.95)... It's $62.  I get that the lease must be expensive at their location, but at least try getting wine from consignment so it's not so obvious.  (I just checked Lifford and they have a nice Sauv Blanc from Paragonia, Argentina for $14.99 -- no, I don't work there)  My friends liked their onion soup but thought the dessert was dry.  I will say that the decor is nice, the place was clean and the waitress was excellent.  I will go back and try the Bloor Street Diner again."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this one short and sweet. Way way way over priced for mediocre food. I mean come on, charging someone $24 bucks for a generic quarter chicken dinner with generic BBQ sauce, coleslaw and sweet potato fries is outrageous. Swiss Chalet's offering is much better. I got the southern style chicken salad sandwich and it was all greasy fried bun with not even a palm sized portion of meat, and was swindled of $16. The only nice thing about our experience here was our server who was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I ordered the salmon egg Benedict with pineapple juice and half an hour later felt nauseous and ended up throwing up due to food poisoning. Won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"The Bloor Street Diner is actually on Bay St. Here's the good: they have a reasonably priced breakfast buffet with good food, considering it's a buffet. It's got enough variety to please even the most diverse palattes at your table. They have a wonderful patio above Bay St. with wicker chairs like the ones they have on the teraces in Paris and inthe winder the glassed in atrium is cozy and lit well. Sometimes they even have a string quartet playing in the corner and the place is generally laid out well.  But it's still in the Manulife Cetre, which is essentially a mall. I only ever go for brunch with a group or to grab a beer before catching a movie at the Varsity Theatre above."}
{"text":"will avoid this place like the plague. Me and a friend ate here last night. The service was bad, the food was awful and even worse my friend was sick from what tasted like tainted crab cakes and experienced violent episodes of food poisoning all night long. When I called the next day to inform the manager she said that she would look into it but highly doubted that it was from their meal claiming that food poisoning takes at least 72hours. I looked online found an actual MEDICAL website that says it can occur as quickly as 30min. There was no regard to our experience and we will not be back. AWFUL http://www.emedicinehealth.com/food_poisoning/page3_em.htm#Food%20Poisoning%20Symptoms This just further solidifies this place's lame customer service- which was lame when we ate there. NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"It was my first visit and will probably be my last. I came here for dinner with friends since we were in the area and sat in the cafe part of the restaurant where there is a bar, pool tables and outdoor patio overlooking Bay St. The menu had a variety of items including salads, sandwiches, pizza, pasta, rotisserie and listed the specials and 3 course prix fixe menu for $27. My friends opted for the prix fixe menu thinking it would be a better value but were soon disappointed with the small portions of their rotisserie lamb and steak with overcooked fries. I ordered the linguine carbonara which was creamy but didn't have that much bacon pieces in it and was just OK.  Service was bad as our server wasn't too attentive or friendly as she took away our bill after we paid without even a smile or word...a simple \"have a good night\" would have been nice.  They do have a dinner and movie combo where you can get a cineplex movie ticket for $7.50 if you spend $15 there. Too bad we weren't watching a movie that night, it could've made up for the experience..well a little bit."}
{"text":"Went here after seeing a film on a Saturday night. Looked like it would be good - French and diner...seemed cool. Patio is nice, location really good too. Food wasn't so-so. Ordered the moules frites...and it was barely lukewarm.  The salmon my friend ordered was really bland. Felt half-assed - like we were eating leftovers."}
{"text":"The next day, was seriously ill. Seems very likely that the mid-rare steak was undercooked. Caused a lot of pain. NEVER going back here. 2.5 star rating is generous for this place!"}
{"text":"I really like the location and interior of this place. However, my experience here was not enjoyable.  The food and portions are okay; but the dishes are somewhat pricy for what they are. The service is slow and snobby.   I don't think I'll be back here again."}
{"text":"I used to be quite a regular fan/patron of this place, but recently I decided to move from the bar area and try the more upscale dining room. Forget it!!!! The place was a zoo, and as tables and chairs were moved around to make place for larger groups, no care was taken by the staff to ensure that existing diners were not disturbed. Sorry guys but you have seen the last of me, especially when the Manager who I brought the attention of my displeasure to  could not seem to care less!"}
{"text":"Barely pleasant food .. service good.  Short wine list. Some outdoor space.  the beef dip was edible .. and the bavette was fine too.  if you're in this neighbourhood - try Wish instead or Societe"}
{"text":"steak sandwich terrible---tough meat,leathery wife's cobb salad--not as a Cobb salad should be. ie taste and apearance. plenty of restaurants around here that are better they are lucky with a built-in customer base."}
{"text":"Living in close proximity to the Manulife Center mall, I've enjoyed many so-so meals at The Bloor Street Diner.  I say 'enjoyed' because the location is great, right inside the glamorous Manulife mall - and the restaurant does have a nice ambiance. In truth, however, the food is only 'so-so. At a recent lunch, for instance, my clam chowder was served lukewarm, and entirely lacked the heartiness you would expect of the dish. My beet and carrot salad, on the other hand, was lovely. The romaine lettuce was crisp and fresh, and the dressing tangy but minimal, so as not to interfere with the salad's generous topping of crumbled blue cheese. Delicious. If only I could say as much for my companion's limp and undercooked, deep fried calamari. What a travesty! Finally, a shared dessert of Nespresso Creme Brulee was unobjectionable, which is kind of how it goes at the Diner: consistently uneven, this always busy restaurant benefits perhaps too much from its captive audience of building residents and denizens of the Manulife mall."}
{"text":"THE SERVICE WAS HORRENDOUS AT THIS PLACE-HORRIBLE ATTITUDE AND RUDE! My boyfriend and I went for brunch at this place today and we were served by the rudest lady. First, she brings us our water and splashes some of it on me and never apologizes for doing so.   We get our food and for the sky high prices, you'd at least expect good quality. I had the chicken of the day and it was dry. I could've had better food and service at Fran's for half the price.After bringing us our orders, this waitress never once makes the attempt to stop by our table to ask if things were okay.   We asked for our bill so that we can get the hell out of this dump, and had to wait 15 minutes for the bill to arrive. When it finally did, I noticed that they charged me $19 for my chicken, but I remembered that the menu had stated it was $18 so I proceed to inform the waitress of this, to which she rolled her eyes and walked away. I then had to wait another 10 minutes for them to fix our bill. Not once did she apologize for their mistake.  I left a crappy tip to reflect her crappy service. I really should've just left her a penny because that's what her service is worth.   I'd rather starve than ever step foot into this place again. If you want overpriced food that is mediocre and some of the worst service ever, then step foot in this place. Seriously, this restaurant needs to step off its pedestal and realize that if you employ waiters with bad attitudes, people aren't willing to pay exorbitant prices and nor will they ever return."}
{"text":"I love the fries here.  Skinny, crunchy, salty.  Mmmm!  They are like the adult Mcdonald's fries.  One would think this would make great fish and chips, or steak et frites... however, the proteins here are only average.  The flank steak, for example, rested far too long.  I am a firm believer in meat resting properly before serving, but come on... this was nearly room temperature.  Mussles in white wine sauce... now, that with the fries... mmm.  Finally found a good combo."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, I usually have the club sandwich. The location is great, nice patio, nice atmosphere but as you can see from the other reviews the service is TERRIBLE.  I'm patient with slow service but this place disappoints me every time, 30+ minutes to make a club sandwich when the place is barely 1/3rd full and fully staffed is insane. If the service was good this place would be great."}
{"text":"I was really impressed by the Sunday brunch. I loved the live jazz playing in the background, the custom made omelette station and wide variety of delicious food. My favourites included the salmon and desserts. They also served eggs benny, sausage, amazing selection of salads, chocolate fountain with fruit and marshmallows!  It was a great ambience, great for families, dates and the table next to us was celebrating a birthday and seemed be enjoying themselves thoroughly. Totally worth the price!"}
{"text":"Average food for the most part.    Appetizers were hit or miss.  The calamari was horrific and were like eating an excessively battered piece of rubber.  The crab cakes however were excellent.  We had a couple steaks.  Both were good, but nothing beyond an average steak.  The New York was considerably better than the Bavette though.  Dessert was pretty good.  The caramel bread pudding was pretty good and the cheesecake wasn't spectacular nor bad."}
{"text":"Erm... okay, so this place is... fine. If you're like me and have always walked by this place thinking, \"What is the deal with this joint, anyway?\" and never bothered to check it out, well they certainly live up to the low-expectations I'd set.  Swung in there for dinner on their patio one warm Wednesday night (a highlight - great people watching and there's something rather francais about the multi-level thing).   The plan was to score some dinner and then head up to Varsity to watch, ahem, 'The Proposal'. TIP: Turns out that Bloor St. Diner has a deal with Varsity where you get a movie ticket for $7 when you spend $15 on dinner. Sounds good to me (just remember not to include that amount in your tip, it's tricky like that. But really, who tips on a movie ticket?)  I ordered the salmon 'burger', which turned out to be more of a sandwich than a proper burger. I was imaging a deliciously thick smoldering hunk of fish with the works, but instead was presented with something that looked like bread/baguette with a thin piece of salmon in side, though the topping of sprouts was a nice addition. One of my friends ordered the good 'ol beef burger - which is always a safe bet in these times of doubt - which looked alright. We both went for 1/2 fries and 1/2 salad, which made for plenty of both.   My other friend was not so lucky - she ordered the Mediterranean Pizza, and as we were waiting for her dish (she ordered later) we were making fun of a confused server trying to find the recipient of a whack looking pita & dip platter. Turns out, that platter ended up at our table as our server had put in the wrong order. Thankfully, our server lived up to her end of the bargain and returned to our table with the correct order. The pizza looked blah, but at least it was more satisfying than pita & dip.   All in all, if you're in the area, just keep walking by this place. It's pretty much exactly as average as you might expect."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my mom 2 weeks ago, I made a reservation online the night before but when we got there they seem to have no record of it. Thankfully, the hostess was nice enough to seat us right away anyways. Me and my mom both ordered an app, for me the crab cakes, for her the tomato soup. Mine was a little pricy at $14 for 2 mini crab cakes even if they did taste good. We both ordered salads, mine was delicious - the phylo goat cheese salad, the cheese was warm, the salad was nicely dressed and the figs were great. My moms spinach salad however lacked some pizazz, it was limp with a bit of cheese wilted overtop. With a coffee the bill came to about $70, a little steep for salad at a diner. While the food was tasty I probably wouldn't come back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Today is Sunday - and me and my gal pal Nicola were looking for somewhere to go for brunch - silly me suggested The Bloor Street Diner.  Here's how brunch plays out for us:  Go to diner, stand at front bar for 10 minutes get noticed...no we are wrong...another few minutes and someone smiles at us...I ask, \"Is brunch still on?\"  Girl who had smiles starts to walk away...we don't move...she looks backs and motions for us to follow...we do.  We are seated in the back, most hidden corner (hmmmm we muct be real unpleasant to one's senses)  10  minutes - no one comes - I notice waiter and ask for a Bloody Mary & coffee - we are informed only brunch is being served....(okay we must look dumb...hence the reason for hiding us in the corner when they are many more suitable seats)  We get up and go to the buffet ...most platters are empty...are they going to fill them up.....and what...no capers and lemon with the smoke salmon???  We get made to order omelets ...yes, they are excellent.  No sense complaining..in a nut shell...I will be passing on Sunday brunch at the diner and recommend you do to."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Good atmosphere but my salad was pathetic. The Shrimp salad for $17 consisted of 4 previously frozen shrimp, thawed, not even grilled, on some lettuce surrounded by three small slices each of grapefruit and avocado. No bread delivered to our table, but noticed that everyone else around us had some. Overall too pricey for what you get. The diner down the street has tastier and more plentiful salads for $10."}
{"text":"This place good be so much better. Service was not very good. My fries were burnt and got a lecture about different cooking oil temps. Table beside had the same issue and got the same lecture. Salmon sandwich  was good. Price point is good for yorkville area. You can buy 1/2 price movie tickets from them with dinner"}
{"text":"Group of 25 went there for a Sunday Brunch last week on April 24th. It was posted on the web 23.95 but when we received the bill they charged 25.95. When we told the waitress she got visibly upset and called the manager. The manager denied but later went back to his office and checked the internet came back and corrected it ! The waitress still denied even after the fact. They requested cash because they did not want to serve individually (too much work) Only myself paid by credit card. I did pay 30 on credit card and paid 1.50 cash on the table with the rest of the group. Today I checked my statement online I noticed that the waitress with an attitude took her liberty to add another dollar to my bill even though I had signed as 30.00 . When I called  today, the manager (different one) said oh you want your dollar come and get it ! when I asked to credit my card back she said I myself have to call head office and ask for refund ! she did not even care and did not take it seriously that changing the numbers and paying tips for themselves is their right ..from their attitude you can tell they have no concept of service ! they should thank their location because their arrogance is not appreciated at all with overpriced food..never never again .."}
{"text":"Food average for the expensive price. $2.75 for a Pop in a tiny glass with no refill. Terrible."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time in the 1990s. I came here on a recent trip back to Toronto. It was probably the first time I visited in ten years! It's still got great ambiance. It's a relaxed place to meet for a drink or dinner with a friend. It's upscale but not pretentious.   The food is always fresh and well prepared. I actually cannot remember what I had on my last visit, but I thoroughly enjoyed it! :)  ps. If you drive, you can get two hours of free parking when you get your ticket validated!"}
{"text":"I ate here for a business lunch the other day. Each time I come, I'm reminded why I don't really want to come back. The problem is that it is close by and convenient to my office and when taking clients out, it looks impressive.   The tables are way too close together and it's hard to have a semi-confidential business meeting as a result.   I had the soup of the day which was a mushroom purée. It arrived very quickly but it wasn't hot enough for my liking (and it's soup!). In addition the bread came after I was finished nearly half of it. For Lunch I ordered the Niçoise salad. Overall it was pretty good and fresh but one thing that I noticed was how little tuna they provided. 3 really tiny pieces. For $18.95 - I think you need to provide a lot more that a bunch of veggies and a couple small pieces of tuna.   Overall, I don't think I will go back (hopefully these aren't famous last words)"}
{"text":"Meh indeed. Certainly convenient for a pre- or post-movie bite, or a sit-down lunch the the Bloor-Bay area, but the food is aggressively mediocre. Everything sounds a lot better than it tastes - roast chicken, quiche, the ridiculously overpriced niçoise salad... all a disappointment."}
{"text":"I have actually been to this restaurant a number of times; most recently, on January 2nd, about 2:30 PM. The only really bad experience I'd had there before this one was on Mother's Day a couple of years ago. To deal with the crowds, I guess, they totally compromised on the quality of food and service.  On Monday, January 2nd,  my friend and I agreed that our server -though she was not the only one - was so unpleasant and unprofessional that it was almost laughable. An older couple sitting next to us looked over and said, \"I guess she's not happy to be here, today.\" Well, maybe she was having a very bad day -we all have them occasionally - but one does not get to make it bad for others, particularly at a place of work. I was the one who had suggested Bloor Street Diner as our meeting place, and felt obliged to apologize to my friend for the off-putting experience.   I would be happy to elaborate should the manager or owner request it.. In the meantime, I hope that the basics of not only customer service but of respect and courtesy, are reiterated at this business. The food is usually fairly decent and the location is great. For me, it is a 'neighborhood' restaurant and I would like to seem them continue to be successful, as they have been for so many years. I hope they will take seriously, the concerns I have raised."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and honestly it's OK at best...  HOWEVER they have a movie deal were you can purchase a Varsity theater ticket for $7.  If you work it out you can get a full meal and a movie for around $20-25 and honestly when was the last time you got any decent food at the theater for $10-$15?  Exactly, I didn't think so.  Save your money from buying the crappy popcorn, drinks and candy from Varsity theater that will run you $10-$20 and get a cooked meal for crying out loud!!!  If they didn't have the movie special I wouldn't eat here though."}
{"text":"I was at the Bloor Street diner for lunch yesterday and it was great.  We were able to get seats on their patio which overlooks Bay street; it was absolutely gorgeous.  The Ahi Tuna club was one well-made and memorable sandwich; it was light, delicious and wonderful.  We also order the Margarita pizza which was just an average pizza.  Service was great but be weary of ordering a second drink, there are no refills on pop (they should have mentioned that before offering more diet coke).  Prices are a bit on the higher side for a diner but it is well priced for the Yorkville area.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for over a decade. In the past, the brunch would be busy and filled with laughter, jazz music and the smell of delicious food. Now, it's quiet... and empty! The quality of the food speaks for itself...it feels like a bad cafeteria breakfast! And to make matters worse, they have increased their prices!! I believe it used to be about $22/person and now it's close to $30!! Really not worth it.   Also: We went as a group of 6 people and one person at our table asked if gratuity was included (since we were a group) and the server told us no. After assuming there was no tip added and without double checking, my friend added 15%. It was only after we left that we discovered that the server lied to us and had already added gratuity. So we ended up paying tip twice! When we went back to complain about this, they were really reluctant to give us the money back (but did). I hope that it was just a misunderstanding..."}
{"text":"Had brunch here on a recent trip to Toronto. The Bills game was playing so I was happy, but the food was just ok. There was nothing spectacular on the menu, just your traditional brunch items."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend`s birthday... horrible, horrible service. The water glasses had fingerprints all over them, the orders took incredibly long to get to our table (when they did arrive... one of our friends didn`t get her complete meal), nobody asked us how our meals were, it took a horribly long time to get service, the food was nothing to write home about... we would`ve been better off booking off a section of McDonald`s and playing in the ball room!"}
{"text":"The service was fast and efficient. Quiche and associated greens fresh and abundant. House white drinkable. Perfect place before a movie. Loved terrace on Bay St."}
{"text":"Working in the area we come here from time to time for business meals. It's pricey but a great atmosphere for the Bloor Street work crowd.   The menu is fairly predicable and never really blows me away (though they do make great salad dressings and their goat cheese salad in particular is delicious) but true to the predictability of the menu the food is consistently good without being great.  Overall, I wouldn't make an effort to come here but if you work in the area check it out, on second thought, you probably already have.  You can park in the Manulife parking lot and they'll validate your ticket."}
{"text":"The food was quite good, and the serving sizes were OK too. We didn't have a reservation, didn't have to wait, and the  price was good to.  A nice casual place to go for a quick bite.  All & all a good experience..  Oh, and much much better than it was when I was there before (I think it was about 20 years ago).  I'd go back and eat there again."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this restaurant has such bad reviews!  Though their caesar salad was a little spicy, my steak-frites and creme caramel were perfect! I enjoyed every bite of my meal.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and cozy, with lovely tiles and a great outdoor sitting area.  Definitely give this place a chance. For people that are worried about the price- maybe you shouldn't be eating at Bay and Bloor in the first place."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to the Bloor Street Diner recently and were extremely disappointed with our meal and service.  Service: our waitress was very rude and unfriendly. When we ordered our dishes, she didn't say a word after taking our order and simply grabbed our menus. We found that she treated the other tables around us respectfully, though. This led us to believe that she treated us in such a rude way because we were students - no matter what age your patrons are, you do not have the right to treat them disdainfully. Needless to say, we didn't tip her well.  Food: The portions were VERY small for what we were paying. I would expect bigger portions for a $17 pasta dish. It wasn't even that flavourful or special in any way. I had the lobster mac and cheese, and there were probably only two strips of lobster. I could get a much better mac and cheese or pasta dish anywhere else. My friend said the same about her $17 pasta dish.  Dessert: All of the desserts were very pricey. My friend decided to share the apple pie, which was $12. When we received our apple pie, the ice cream was practically melted - first red flag. We dug into the apple pie first and realized it wasn't hot at all. In fact, the bottom part of the pie was cold - definitely pre-made. The apple pie filling wasn't that bad itself, but it wasn't worth $12 AT ALL. By the time we got to the ice cream, it was pretty much goop - disgusting. I took a couple of scoops, only to later find A PIECE OF PLASTIC in my scoop. I was horrified and enraged.  The manager later came by, apologized and said that they order the ice cream from a company. He said that he had heard about this problem before and complained to the company, but knew that there would be a rare chance for this to happen again. He called us the \"unlucky ones.\" That is NOT a good excuse. If you've heard about the problem before, you had better be extra cautious when preparing your ice cream for your customers. What if I had been a mother with a child and fed my child some of this ice cream that had PLASTIC hidden inside? Unacceptable. Either make sure there isn't plastic inside or DISCONTINUE purchasing ice cream from this company.  Overall, horrible experience and I will never return to this place or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"My first visit was a couple of years ago, and I left pretty unimpressed, but gave it another try recently and was pleasantly surprised. They have a different omelette special every day, among other things, and it was excellent. The salad was fresh and simply dressed, and the frites were pretty decent, especially with mustard from the Grey Poupon bottles out on every table.  Visits since then have varied... so the major drawback here is inconsistency in the kitchen.   It's often busy, but not noisy, and the feel of personal space maintains.   There are two separate seating areas. If you need the \"nice meal out\" ambiance, ask for the room closer to the mall entrance. Otherwise, they will generally bring you to the bistro-y street side area, which opens out to a patio in the summer. Smoke and snob allergic persons would do well to avoid it during the month of TIFF."}
{"text":"Bleh! My Nicoise salad here tasted like the tuna came from a can and the greens were browning around the edges. BIG blegh.  That should be all you need to know.   However, I feel that I should add at least one good thing since there isn't an option of zero stars.  Thus, my one star is allocated strictly to the location of the outdoor patio. Great for people watching along the Bay and Bloor intersection."}
{"text":"So being a brunch enthusiast, we checked out Bloor street diner for the brunch buffet. (I have done dinner here as well - not that great). For $20 per person, it's a great deal with a decadent chocolate fountain. The buffet included omelettes made to order and bennys and some really great pastries. We were seated on the patio and the service was great. The only thing to keep in mind is that it is quite loud on the patio as its on bay street. Perfect place for a decadent brunch and a movie which is exactly what we did. Definitely go back."}
{"text":"The location can't be beat, and years ago, the Bloor Street Diner was far better.  The food and service, though, have declined (the service was downright nonexistent).  The prix fixe menu is a rip off, with one of the worst bread puddings I've ever had.  Eat here only if you absolutely must."}
{"text":"If you are tired of dining out at your local pub and you want an experience that is slightly more upscale, try the Bloor Street Diner.  I have been coming here for many years.  I enjoy the Parisian style concept, which is casual yet upscale. The menu choices are good along with the quality of the food.  The service is usually quite attentive and turn around times are quick.     The prices are not cheap, however in my opinion the quality is there on a consistent basis.  This restaurant is the sort of place you can feel equally comfortable inviting business clients to the dining room, or meeting your friends for drink and a meal after work in the cafe."}
{"text":"This was pretty bad, two stars is generous I think.   I was here on a Sunday afternoon and although I expected it to be busy for the brunch/lunch buffet I was shocked at how understaffed they were. To be honest, there were not that many people there at all so it should have been easier to get a table. When I arrived, there was no one at the entrance to seat people. I waited about five minutes while I watched a single waiter walk around in the area beside me but he never came over because he was going back and forth between the kitchen and the dining room clearing plates. More than one staff member saw me standing there from afar but again no one said or did anything about the fact that there was no hostess anywhere to be found. After 5 minutes or so, some women came in after me and they got fed up with waiting as well so they called the waiter over and he seated us.   Overall the food was okay, definitely nothing to write home about. The food generally tasted pretty good but it had obviously been sitting around for a while in the bowls and heating trays. My eggs benny was there so long that the english muffin was like a brick, impossible to cut through. So pretty standard quality buffet food for a non-standard buffet price; a bit on the pricey side for sure.   The waitress who waited on us was nice but forgot to come back to give me change even though she had asked, but otherwise she was quite good.   I thought the big windows and wicker furniture in the back were nice and overall it's a nicely decorated restaurant. Would maybe give it another try but probably not for the buffet (not worth it). Hopefully by then they'll have found their hostess!"}
{"text":"This was our goto place for a before movie dinner. Is it just me or have these prices gotten beyond ridiculous. Seriously, 10.50 for 2 small greasy spring rolls? Wth? For 2 bowls of just ok soup, 2 6 oz glasses of wine, and the spring rolls, it came to 70 bucks! There are WAY too many great restaurants in Toronto to put up with being ripped off by Bloor st diner. That said, service was great!"}
{"text":"A huge disappointment.  Dinner consisted of a flatiron steak ordered medium rare that leaned more towards medium than rare.  The fries were a bit too salty and I came away feeling greasy and unsatisfied.  I just wasn't impressed.  For the quality of food, I begrudge the dollars parted with for this so-so meal.     There are prix fixe menu items for $25 that provides more value, however, I would be loathed to add on to a main meal that based on my experience would be unsatisfactory.  The $7 Cineplex movie ticket deal (tickets can be used at all cineplex theatres, not just the Varsity upstairs) seems to be popular with diners."}
{"text":"the main \"pros\" of this place are convenience of location, and it does have a nice patio.    The rest is very disappointing! it's heyday is definitely very long gone.  Living in the area, I have been going over many years and can say that their original brunch was quite good and now it is barely passable, definitely not a choice I would make anymore.   Went for dinner yesterday and had a cocktail to start, wasn't sure if there was any alcohol in the drink as stated, but my fault for even thinking to order a cocktail here.   We did ask for some bread and ordered an appetizer. After waiting quite a while for some bread to make it to our table, within  a minute of it coming, our appetizer came. Just as we were starting our appetizer, literally within 6-7 minutes max, our entrees came. We had just started on our appetizer and were shocked at the timing.   The server just stood there, looking blankly and waiting for us to hurriedly make room on our table for the entrees. Within 2 minutes our main server came asking how our (untouched) steaks were, and we were just still trying to eat our appetizer!   After mentioning our surprise, our server did say our entrees could be taken away until we were ready for them (hmm! only to sit drying out under a heat lamp! no thank you) or also that new entrees would be brought out when we were ready, again (I truthfully and honestly could not see this place scrapping them and recooking new strip steak entrees).   I honestly can say this place is really overpriced for the actual quality of food offered. I do not mind paying for a quality meal, but this, unfortunately will never be the case here."}
{"text":"Overpriced- $16 for a nothing-special plate of Moule frites?   Lame service- we waited forever and there was barely anyone there. and when we Did get service, the server was lame. we asked if we could have some olives to start off with coz we were hungry, and frankly, waited 10  mins for him to attend to us. he said No. those are only available at the bar. really? You couldn't scrounge up a few freakin' olives on a small plate for 3 people who were going to spend $80++? that's bad training and no initiative right there.   Won't be back.  PS: it's more like a bistro (complete with terrible Parisian attitude) than a diner. completely misnamed"}
{"text":"The best thing at the Bloor Street Diner is their \"french food\", french onion soup and their muscles and fries. It's as good as I've had in Montreal. I've not been to Paris yet so I can't compare that.   They are normally busy, so the service can be a little slower at times. It is a very pleasant atmosphere. It isn't \"fru-fru\" (I guess that is the diner part) but it has a upper scale vibe.   The summer season, the patio looks on to Bloor Street, it is a nice place to have a drink in the summer.    I'm not a terrible fan of the desserts unfortunately. The bread pudding is good and so is the ice-cream sundae (it is nice to split with a friend). I hope they expand their cake menu."}
{"text":"I definitely felt fancy at this place.  It is *not* cheap at all (luckily, it was a company lunch otherwise I'd never have eaten there).   I had a cobb salad with no bacon. It was yummy and very filling (salad usually dooesn't fill me) of course it cost $16...  The waiter wasn't particularly friendly or charming (esp giving the prices of the food we were ordering) and when I specified any black tea but Earl Grey...he brought me Earl Grey :P    Nice location, fancy environment but for those prices (if it were coming out of my wallet) I'd expect much more."}
{"text":"The only thing this place has going for it is the big patio overlooking Bay Street. It's otherwise crap.  I've stumbled into this place twice now, and both times were terribly disappointing. The food is overpriced for what you get. I remember my chicken wrap was dry and tasted like cardboard. It amazes me that this place is still around. AVOID!"}
{"text":"This was always a place that I would walk past in my many trips to watch movies here, it was not until recently that I came in here for dinner. I have been twice since and both experiences were similar. In that they consisted of slow service and over priced yet below par food quality.   They have a decent number of menu items but none that really stood out to me when it came to ordering. I ended up having the soup and two items from their Italian selection. The soup was not amazing and the pasta while large in portion was lacking in taste.  The only reason it's getting 2 stars as opposed to the one is location, the area for ordering food to go is convenient and quick and it looks nice inside. Speaking of \"quick\" the service in the actual restaurant while friendly is very slow and we too have  had problems splitting bills etc.  My advice is cross the street and pay the few extra $$ and have a good meal at a decent Yorkville restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm talkin' Sundays!  Bloor Street Diner offers a pretty mediocre menu during the week.  It features your normal, chicken, steak, potatoes, fries, salad - generic during the week.  Can't really do this wrong, but it's nothing spectacular either.  Sundays are a little bit more special.  Sunday is their breakfast/ lunch buffet with the chocolate fountain.  That's right, I said Chocolate Fountain!!!  They have an assortment of goodies for their Sunday Buffet menu.  Everything is laid out in 4 stations.  1) Omlette station, you can choose your own ingredients for an omelette.  Plus you can get fresh carved Ham or Roast Beef at this station.  The omlette is made fresh in front of you.  2)  The pasta salad, salad and hot food station.  I know it sounds like a lot, but this is one of the main tables.  One half is salad galore: sweet potato salad, green bean salad, articoke salad, 2 or 3 different pasta salads, cous cous salad, etc.  And then they have hot breakfast/ lunch foods: Eggs Benny, Bacon, Sausage, Chicken, Potatoes, Mac and Cheese.  3)  The Dessert and Chocolate Fountain station: there is cookies, brownies, cheese trays, fruit and finally: chocolate fountain.  They have a shish kabob fruit skewers so you can stab and dip in as little or as much chocolate as your heart desires.  4)  The pancake and french toast station: this one is kind elegant, with the fixin's for a serious pancake or french toast experience.  Coffee, juice and everything is free refillable so that's nice.  The food is ok, but it's got a nice atmosphere with a little bit of something for everyone.  Great for summertime patio brunch-fest, bring your eating pants though."}
{"text":"Steak Frits with peppercorn sauce is excellent. Get it on the 25 dollar prix-fixe menu, comes with salad and dessert."}
{"text":"This place is too expensive for what they have.  That being said the food is alright but way overpriced in my opinion.  Also it took them a while to seat us which I was not a fan of.  $9 for a slice of cake?!  Am I just super poor and that's normal price?  Yikes.  Place is nice though.  Don't get the Tuna Club, not worth the money.  The smoked salmon egg's Benedict wasn't bad for the money but I'm sure I could have gotten something much more yummy almost anywhere else at half the price.  The 2 star rating is for the atmosphere and cleanliness and \"decent\" food but man, way over priced."}
{"text":"Located in the Manulife Centre located on Bloor Street West, I discovered the Bloor Street Diner when me and some friends who were visiting Toronto on the fateful day a freak rainstorm struck Toronto (Monday, July 7, 2013) during evening rush hour. That storm, which resulted in mass floodings and the heaviest rainfall in over 60 years provided many a good reason to seek shelter anywhere.  My friends, were recommended the Bloor Street Diner by friends of them who were also traveling with them and we decided to give them a try. As many customers were pouring in to escape the storm, the seating was limited and the service was slow, but the overall experience was great.  Great appetizers and dishes, a fine selection of wines, and desert make this restaurant an ideal place for a business lunch, Sunday Brunch or dinner.   The restaurant's interior decor was wonderful, seating was great and while it was raining the evening I was there, I did notice they offer outdoor seating during the summer.  Overall, an enjoyable dining experience regardless of the torrential rains that pounded Toronto that evening."}
{"text":"I went to The Bloor Street Diner for a nice dinner with my French class before our theater performance. In this establishment, there is amazing dining room ambiance. The service was very fast and efficient. The food had lots of flavour and the dishes were presented very nicely. I would recommend trying the fixed price menu for $28.50 plus taxes. There are good options to choose from the fixed price menu and I strongly recommend trying the daily rotisserie special from the kitchen. The deserts were just delicious. I wanted to try a bite out my fellow classmates' dessert plates but I was too busy enjoying my daily dessert special, it was absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Used to come here quite a bit when I lived in Toronto.  I came by after a movie and it was not as great as I remembered.   It was disappointing.   We had a nice waiter but the place was packed and it was fairly slow.   The food was bland.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"The younger (and cheaper?) sibling of the Bloor Street Diner Family.  I was starving so I walked into Manulife for food. Looking at the prices between the Bloor Street Diner and L'Express, I noticed that the latter offered practically the same items, but at a cheaper price. I just wanted a quick bite so I grabbed the grilled chicken salad.  For $7.50, the salad was bland, small, and stale.   Maybe their warmer dishes are better? Who knows?  Anyway, I don't think I'll be back ... but I'm sure they'll survive without me. They're in a prime location that has many, many, many people coming and going.  In Toronto, it's a solid 2 star ~"}
{"text":"Bloor Street Diner seems to get a bad rap (not the Vanilla Ice variety, no offense \"Ice-heads\"). I tend to agree with pretty much all trending criticisms/complements but I can certainly be more specific about my personal experience:  \"The service is excellent\"  I've seen it written numerous times, this is clearly their perceived highlight. I've been here twice in the past two years, and both times the server has been adequately attentive, helpful, and generous. Our table of six quickly received additional bread on request, we made substitutions easy, our food was prompt and hot, and our napkins were even dispensed on our laps for us (not that I asked [nor would I]).   Was it better than average? I would argue not - being friendly, helpful and attentive is the default. Bread is generally complimentary. To that extent, I wasn't blown away by a commonly Yelp-mentioned bright spot.  \"The food is disappointing\"  I ordered the prix fixe menu: a Caesar salad, followed by Mussels with Frites, followed by Bread Pudding.  All three were good. I could never be blown away by an anchovy-less caesar salad, which this was. The frites were fantastic - another Yelper described them as \"McDonald's Fries for grown-ups\" which I think is accurate. The mussels were served in a white wine sauce reminiscent of a liquid bruschetta. The bread pudding was tender and tasty, served with a dollop whipped cream.  In all, the meal was decent, and I wouldn't say I was disappointed by my expectations - rather by the associated price tag.  \"The prices do not reflect the quality of the food\"  This is definitely where I believe BSD falters - I'm sure reviews would not be so low if the value reflected the offerings. The food is not bad per se, but in a city with infinitely fantastic offerings, a restaurant charging 20-30 dollars for a main needs to rationalize that cost.   The pizza is the same price as Libretto's. The sweet potato gnocchi is the same price as AYCE gnocchi at Piola. Their eggs benny is 16 dollars, no doubt a premium variety superior to the 11-13 dollar brunch bennies you can get pretty much everywhere in the city.  In all, I think 2.5 is a perfect Yelp score, nestled between \"meh I've had better, and A-OK\" - at the very least it's a perfect description of most diners' reactions to the inflated prices. The food is fine, the service is fine - the location is convenient. I'm just not sure why you wouldn't eat somewhere better for cheaper."}
{"text":"I took a friend from out of town to brunch there yesterday.I had been there a few years back and had a really enjoyable time. All I can say from the time we walked in until we left it was just a horrible experience. We asked to be sat on the patio since it was the first nice day of the year. Waited for about 5 minutes for a server to show up to no avail. (the place was dead). we decided to make our way to the \"buffet\", the selection was decent at best, lots of lower end salads. Bacon looked like it was cooked 3 hours prior. Chose a few items and stopped by the juice selection to grab a glass. A waitress came rushing over and asked what we wanted, I told her we wanted some orange juice, rudely she said \"i will get it for you, like we werent suppose to help ourselves. I thought that was the idea of a buffet. I then asked if I could order a caesar and get some cutlery on our table. She asked where I was seated and then went on to explain that most people wait until a server comes to the table to order. I tried explaining that we waited for a server and apparently she wasnt interested as she walked away during my explanation. We went back to our table to \"enjoy\" our meal. The sausage was cold and dry, eggs benny, cold and hard, potatoes mushy.  after another long wait our server showed up with our caesar and water, not even a hello how how are you but \" did you order this\". dropped it off and walked away. I had to get up and ask for ketchup (for the potatoes). We didnt even eat half our plates but decided to make a second visit to try some carvery meat. The roast beef looked so dry and small that it looked like a leftover from last Sunday. I decided on the ham, must say it was quite good, moist and fresh. Never did our server come by and ask how we were doing. I think he had a really rough night before, never did he even attempt to smile. Ive been in the service industry for over 20 years in various capacities including server, bartender, proprietor and Executive Chef. NEVER would I allow this kind of service, for or attitude from any of my staff. I guess thats why the place was next to empty. Im so surprised because the company as a whole used to have such high standards. They need to step up their game if they are going to survive much longer. Anyway, an $80. Lesson"}
{"text":"This review is for the lunch menu.  Decent food, though very expensive for what it is. Slow, inattentive service. Thoroughly underwhelming."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends for a winter holiday celebration dinner. This place was chosen because it was also managed by the same people as the CN TOWER 360 restaurant and was also classy.  Certainly the restaurant was beautiful although not equipped to hold a group gathering (10). We made a reservation and ended up with a group of tables that followed the linear shape of the banquette  which was unfortunately convex. So half of our group could not talk to each other. The service was nothing special for such a classy restaurant. They got our order, it took 45 minutes for the food to come, and every few orders came at long intervals at a time. We didn't hear from our waitress until we hailed for the check.    I ordered the bavette steak and frites for $25.  it was a very expensive. I looked at the menu and thought this was gonna be expensive anyway so why not go for steak. So I get a steak the size of fist and a scrawny pile of very thin fries. I suppose the portioning may be appropriate (I was full) however the plate looked very bare (lots of white space). I don't expect much but the meat should have been sliced and fanned on the plate and the frites -maybe in a basket with a sauce cup and a little coleslaw or salad. It was very plain, bare bones. A burger and fries at five guys to go might have been better in that case.  The steak itself did not look like a lot but that was because the cut was thick. I asked for medium-rare and it was actually really juicy, well seasoned and delicious. The Frits on the other hand were dry, salty and tasted burnt; probably because they were so thin. overall the dish was pretty dark and heavy.  I of course the only reason I came here was for a special occasion but I would not go here on my own again because of the price alone."}
{"text":"I was here for The Father's Day brunch buffet.  The food was mediocre (French toast was cold, waffles were cold and stale, pasta salad wasn't chewy). The coffee was also sub par.  I don't expect much for service at a buffet - it was okay, dirty plates were cleared quickly.   For the price ($40 per person) I expect food to be better.  Also, since kids under 4 eat free, the place was jammed with loud, badly behaved children.  For the price and location, I was honestly surprised and disappointed by the food."}
{"text":"A cute little place within the Manulife building. I tried the fixed menu selection which is a three course meal for just under $33. Overall food was tasty, gravy on the steak was slightly salty and servers were extremely nice."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a lunch and I wasn't completely disappointed, but the food was just average - especially considering it was above average prices. I got the daily special pasta, and the pasta was slightly undercooked. The flavour was good though. The cute patio made up for it a little, but won't visit again."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning after eatting their salmon Benedict. I threw up half an hour later multiple times,  I then contacted the store to speak to the manager and told him what happened.. guess what.... he kept on denying that it was the restaurant and couldn't even take the time to apologize. I have never seen such an awful manager, this restaurant is the worse. I advise everyone to please stay away before you get food poisoned like how I did!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and my experience (namely the food) has been a little hit-and-miss. The service has always been pretty great but the entrees I've ordered have ranged from rather fantastic (the beer-battered fish and chips) to somewhat bland (some mushroom/pasta special).  The first time I came here I had some sort of roast beef sandwich, which was quite delicious. I decided to be good and get a salad to go with it, which was a huge mistake. The salad was literally lettuce with light vinaigrette. It was disappointing to say the least, and I only took a couple of bites. Another time I had a proper spinach salad, which tasted good, but again was very light on bells and whistles. Nothing more than baby spinach soaked in some sort of sauce.  Anyway, the place is decent. They have a patio overlooking Bay Street which would be nice during the summer. I would just avoid getting salad with anything, unless you ask them to spruce it up a little."}
{"text":"Came to The Bloor Street Diner express to grab a bagel and coffee. I waited for someone to come around to take my order and from the other side of the bar, I hear... \"Hi.. what do you want\" LOL !!!!! In my head I'm like is this for real???? hmmmm okkk....  went to pour my coffee and I think I poured a little bit of 3 mixes..... why you ask??? ... THEY WERE ALLLLLLL DONE!!!!! until i flagged her down and told her to replace them, she only put a new french vanilla and walked away.   I came back to the office and opened the wrapper..and TADA!!!!!!!! Amazed by how small the bagel was I was done in about 3 bites. At a cost of 3.00 (with cream cheese) what a joke."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I'm not a very picky person, but I found the food exceeded my expectations. I ordered the Côte de Buf for 2 and got a steakhouse quality cut of beef at a casual-upscale 24 hour diner. I thought the server was very friendly, but a bit slow. They seemed to be busier than expected. I will be back for the brunch buffet. 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place is pricey for what it is.   I'll be honest, I got a sandwich from here and I liked it. It was a fish sandy and it was pretty tasty. But it was not cheap ( maybe 14 bucks - don't quote me on that one ).   It was good, seemed pretty popular. However, I haven't had the temptation to go back."}
{"text":"Horribly over-priced and very poor quality food. Clearly, this place is out to gauge in an upscale cares. Ordered the sirloin burger ...  Received a frozen patty, with a lame side salad. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Wow, surprised at all the hate here.  A volunteer board I sit on decided to hold our AGM here. We booked a table for 8 people and once myself and the president had arrived we ordered food to arrive at the table for about 15 minutes after everyone had arrived.   The server was very attentive and got the drink orders fulfilled as each guest arrived. Unfortunately we had ordered too much food as it seemed a handful of people wouldn't be attending the meeting last minute. When we informed the server if we could cancel some of our order she literally ran to the kitchen to see what she could do.  She was quickly able to stop a couple of the pizzas we had ordered but everything else was either ready to go or was in progress. So we ended up eating their quesadila, veggie & dip plate, pepperoni pizza, and the spinach & artichoke dip.  The food was pretty good, nothing to overly get excited about. I enjoyed the crust on the pizza, nice a tender and a little chewy. The sun-dried tomato dip on the platter had a nice level of saltiness and a good bite on the palate. Everything else was good and would be worth ordering, my only complaint would be that the quesadila was a little dry in texture.  So while the food might be a solid three stars, the extra star comes for the service. Our server went above and beyond!"}
{"text":"Walking down Bloor and looking for a place with patio, and here we were.  Our server was a friendly guy with attentive service.  The food came in a bit slow but no complaints as it was such a nice breezy day to hang out.  Both the beef carpaccio and the onion soup were good.  The best dish was Brioche grilled cheese.  $14.50 seemed like a bit pricey for a sandwich, but this brioche was so superb.  It was light and puffy; making it such a good match with the melted cheese and freshly sliced tomato.  Delux diner sundae came in a large sundae glass with a warm chocolate brownie and topped with ice cream and berries. What a great dessert to end a meal!"}
{"text":"Bad.  The first time i went the food was nothing special. I ordered the sweet potato gnocchi and the portion was a bit small. I really had dinner there because it was pouring outside and I had to walk home. Anyway, the second time I went with my boyfriend and we didn't even stay. First of all the restaurant was not busy at all and they took a while to give us a table. Then the waiter brought the menu and never came back. Literally, so we didn't even have the chance to order! He didn't serve us water either! We waved at other waiters but I guess they weren't \"designated\" to our table and they kept ignoring us. It was just awful so about 15-20 minutes later we decided to leave. On our way to the exit nobody said goodbye until we asked to speak to the manager. We asked what kind of service was that and he apologized and gave us a card to get a free meal next time. There will be no next time because I will not go back there, I'd rather pay for my lunch somewhere else than eat there for free."}
{"text":"food is bland. service is okay. Don't get the angel hair pasta."}
{"text":"i took my son and myself for lunch this weekend to The Bloor Street Diner.  I ordered the nicois salad.  I have had this salad many times in my life.  They just put some green salad out of a bag, some too large onion pieces on top and some tasteless tuna.  Not happy with this almost 20 dollar salad.  My son had a salad with a clump of greens and one piece of goat cheese covered in a filo pastry.  Not nice for the price."}
{"text":"I am easy to please.  If you've got cold beer and something edible I will likely leave with a favourable opinion of your establishment.  People who eat out with me regularly know that I'm generally happy with whatever I get and rarely complain.  But I just have to complain about my shoddy experience at The Bloor Street Diner yesterday evening.   A couple of friends and I went for a pre-movie drink on the patio and it took over 20 minutes to get our drink orders in, a time period in which I would have normally downed my first pint.  The time between ordering drinks and receiving them was 10-15 minutes, which oddly enough was the same amount of time it took for my companions to receive the food they eventually ordered.  Surely pulling a pint takes less time than assembling brushetta, no? After I finished my first drink, I was left with an empty glass for half an hour.   While my group and I were there for almost three hours, we only consumed 2 drinks each, but would have happily consumed more, had we been given the chance.  While the server was pleasant, she paid us very little attention and as a result our bill and her tip were far less than they could have been.  So, to sum up - really bad service and I will avoid returning here in the future."}
{"text":"BSD is a comfortable reliable spot I go to when I just want some good food and a familiar setting. Good variety in the menu, nice wine and beer selection, and friendly staff. View of the Bay/Bloor intersection from the bistro side is always pleasant plus the patio is good in the summer. I've been here many times and plan to return."}
{"text":"I think it really depends what you're coming here for.  I have been here on 2 separate occasions - once in the summer for drinks on the patio and once in the \"upscale\" dining area for dinner.  Both VERY different experiences, which makes it difficult to rate this establishment.  Best to break them up.  Patio: 3 & a 1/2 stars It was a beautiful summer day, and some friends and I had some time to kill before going to see a movie at the Varsity.  We were thrilled to discover that if you spend $15 at the BSD, you can purchase your Cineplex movie ticket for $7.50! Score! We enjoyed a few drinks on the patio and it was lovely.  Service was a little bit slow, but other than that, it was a pleasant experience. However, I suppose it is tricky to screw up pints on the patio... Regardless, I'd go again during patio season.  Dining Area: 2 stars  There are two dining areas at the Bloor Street Diner.  The first, over by the windows, is more casual, and the second is sectioned off at the back and is decked out to look more upscale.  We sat in the upscale dining area the evening that I was there for dinner.  I found it pretty hilarious when our waitress went around placing our napkins in each one of out laps. Seemed a bit pretentious and out of place given the setting.  The whole dining area smelled like fish that evening and it was terribly off putting. We had the crab cakes to start and they were actually really good!  However, everyone agreed that the meal took a downwards turn from there as our main courses were not very good.  I had the roast chicken and found it very dry and definitely in need of a gravy!!  The desserts that we tried were also were sub-par.  My bread pudding seemed stale and as if they'd just thrown it in the microwave to quickly warm it through.  To sum it up? Drinks on the patio? YES. Dinner? NO."}
{"text":"Went tonight for dinner and very disappointed. There seemed to be only one waiter that was running the show so service was slow. I got the rotisserie chicken which was extremely dry and bland. My friend got fish and chips which was soggy and didn't taste too great either. Took us a while to get our beers and no one came by to make sure we had water. The waiter noticed we didn't like the food and offered us a dessert on the house to compensate. At that point, we were just tired and wanted out. Tried to enjoy the dessert. Only reason I give this place two stars is because the waiter was kind and the manager came to apologize. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money. Overpriced and not worth it =("}
{"text":"I popped by here for an appetizer and a couple drinks before a movie yesterday. I ordered the bruschetta and it was fine. It was close to $9 for four relatively small pieces, but I didn't feel too ripped off. I also had a vodka martini and it was good. My bro had the fried chicken sandwich which was supposed to be served on a cheddar biscuit, but they were out so they subbed a plain bun. Humph. I tried the fries and they were a bit soggy. The best part of the experience other than sitting on the patio and watching people scurry by was definitely our server who was lovely and fun."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm surprised how badly people hate on this place.  I've been quite a few times over the past 4 years for lunch and I've never had any awful experiences.  I went back recently at lunch time and the service was great.   The food is just \"ok\". The menu is kind of boring and has lots of choices for unadventurous eaters (burgers, thin crust pizzas, salads, rotisserie, sandwiches, etc). I've had the pizzas, cobb salad, grilled cheese and rainbow trout and all were completely average. Portion is big and it's just ever so slightly overpriced considering the food is just adequate.  They do have a nice patio and it's overall a good choice for a business lunch or when dining with picky eaters."}
{"text":"A 3.5 star experience! First note is that this is not really a diner experience....come to think of it, I am not sure what this place is trying to be: there is a \"fresh meat\" display upon the entrance a la Marche/Richtree, followed by some fancy decor, followed by a dining area that has \"cafe\" style marble tables, and finally a pool table in the opposite corner... It makes no sense.  Moving on to the menu, we find more confusion. Sirloin steak is next to Curried Lamb, whereas the appetizers includes options from Vietnam to Lousiana and Mexico and back to Thailand!   So realizing that this is not your average diner setting, you can go on to enjoy a slightly above average meal while enjoying the Bloor St. view.  From What I have tried, the curried lamb is decent given that this is not an Indian restaurant. The veal sandwich was somewhat dry and the burger was quite average.  On the plus side, I recognized some people from CBC news, so as far as \"celebrity spotting\" in Toronto goes, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Went here with my family for a quick dinner before an event. It was neither on Bloor Street nor a diner, so deceiving on both counts.  They sat us at a table squeezed between two other tables, and we felt incredibly close and uncomfortable. We asked to move to one of the many other empty tables that weren't within arms length of other patrons.  I had the nicoise salad and split the gnocchi with my sister. I originally wanted the shrimp, avocado, and grapefruit salad but was informed that it would not be safe for my allergies (to bivalves like clams and oysters) because of they way they store their seafood. I found that a bit odd.  Anyway, my salad was good but nothing special, and the fried gnocchi was a bit of a disappointment. The wild mushroom and charred leek \"pesto\" was more like a duxelles, which would be good stuffed into a ravioli but it was too overpowering just heaped on the plate underneath the gnocchi.  I wouldn't come here again when there are so many other great restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Nothing really too special about this diner, and its pricey. Ordered bruschetta and mussels to share, as we weren't too hungry. Both were good but not too impressive. I probably wouldn't be a returning customer, however the service was pretty good."}
{"text":"We were here for dinner with a friend.  It was really busy when we arrived, but the place was huge so we got a table immediately, the food took a while, but we ordered bruchetta to start and my friends ordered the salmon entree and steak while I had the lamb burger.  The steak is average and salmon looked pretty good and while the portion sizes seemed average, the lamb burger was on the other hand pretty bad.  There was no flavour what so ever and very dry.  I would go back to the place but definitely ordering something else."}
{"text":"If this is where you're going for a pricy French dinner or brunch, I have to ask: vraiment? Vraiment? (Said like French Amy Pohler.)   It is so pricy for what it is, but I do understand its purpose. Once upon a time it was thought of as the best brunch and a great French resto in Toronto. It hasn't done much to grow, improve or even stay at that level. My partner's Cobb salad was just plain sad looking last time I was here, and Leslieville laughs at their brunch. Nay, cackles. Their omelette bar is reminiscent of the one in my residence caf on Sundays in first year uni.   However, if you're in the market for a French onion soup before a movie upstairs, and from time to time who isn't, this is your go to place... your only place."}
{"text":"The Good  Nice ambience in the Patio, fresh produce and tasty food, prompt seating by hostess. Try their spicy chicken wrap-its mmm delicious.  The Bad  Overpriced food, no complimentary starters - bread, service is a bit slow.  The Ugly  If you buy 15$ worth before tax you get 1 movie ticket free. Now, this is a very good proposition which makes the whole thing a value for money deal.    However our waitress failed to mention this fact. Had she done so we would have even indulged in a dessert to avail the 2 complimentary movie tickets. She even forgot to mention that we could get  free movie ticket!! That is absurd.   While going out when we realised this after seeing the ad on the billboard, we went back to inquire of the free ticket. We were bluntly told that since the bill was closed we cannot avail any such offer, it can be only done while ordering the food(Sale MID 5624650; REF#00000023; 9th June 2014-19:26). Any other place would have tried to rectify throe oversight but not here! This sort of spoiled the whole thing and hence the 2 star or else it would have been 3.5 to 4.."}
