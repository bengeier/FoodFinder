{"text":"Located at commerce gate plaza. This place is spacious and allows customers to play games as well. Overall, it's decent but not spectacular. I was a bit surprised by the unavailability of some items. I came with a big group and a few of us ordered and were later told they sold out or couldn't make the item. Of most surprise was the waffle. We were told that they didn't have the ingredients which is surprising since the batter ingredients are staple items.

Food:
They have a huge menu has lots of selection.  If you're a fan of durian, they  have some durian desserts. Ordered honey lemon aloe drink and the Dimples treasure. Both were a decent size for the price but the taste was so so. 

Atmosphere:
Comfortable seating with attentive service. The servers went out of their way to seat us by asking other tables to change so that our big group could be accommodated together."}
{"text":"Great place for friends to get together. They're foods are pretty good and they now table games."}
{"text":"I came here to try this place out on a Monday night and it was completely empty. As in, there wasn't even anyone behind the counter. We stood there for a couple minutes and no one came out. So we left.
Not a great impression, especially with the large competition in the same plaza."}
{"text":"Tried out this new bubble tea place located in commerce gate last night. For a friday night this place wasn't too busy.

Their menu offers lots of choices for drinks, snacks and desserts. My friend and I tried the milk tea with pudding and strawberry milk tea with hand made pearls.

Their hand made pearls remind me of One Zo Tapioca in downtown where they have multiple flavors : cactus, sweet potato, brown sugar, pudding etc.

When you choose the hand made pearls though you can't specifically choose one flavor- it has to come mixed, and the tapiocas are in smaller sizes.

The pricing is decent - $5.49 with the hand made pearls added. However the bubble tea was very thick and was a bit too sweet even though i asked for less sugar.

The service was ok.
I wouldn't mind coming back again."}
{"text":"If there was a 3.5 star, I'd give this place one. It's between ok and good but just not enough to push it to a 4 for me.

The place is between a small to medium size and can handle maybe a few bigger groups of 6-8 and has several 2-4 tables. Decor is also pretty simple and neat.

Service was ok, the usual you would get at any other place when it wasn't busy. Yes, I went at a time when there was one big group and 2 other smaller groups at the time. Maybe it's just my luck? Kidding, just probably timing that's all! They sat me down with menus and after my friend came, I wasn't sure if I should flag them down or go up to order. They checked up on me a couple times before my friend came but after that it was scarce. Ended up going up to order...is that how it works here? Just wondering...

Menu has a really nice variety and sectioned off pretty well and clear. I ordered a wintermelon milk tea with grass jelly and also a dessert that had mango ice cream with jelly, sago, fresh mangoes, lychee boba and mango juice to pour on it (clearly forgot the name of the order but it was near the top of one of their dessert pages)! Everything tasted really good and I definitely enjoyed the dessert!

Long story short, this place isn't so bad and I guess it would be a nice place to chill or study if you catch their quiet times :) would I return? Sure, why not? Afterall, I do have a sweet tooth and would like to try their other asian desserts ;P"}
{"text":"This is a fair price and good value desert place. The portion is fair for the price but the deliousness is unbelievable. Would recommend the durian sago if you're into durian"}
{"text":"The place r nice, however it's overprice comparing to the quality and presentation of the food they sent out. 

We order the chocolate waffle and a mango coconut tapioca, the tapioca are undercook and every bite I felt like I ate a chunk of flour.

For the waffle $10 is even ridiculous, is hard and dry as a pieced wood, with one scoop of ice cream on the side, both of us can even ate half of it.

I have no idea why the music keep on and off, feels weird because we are the only customer there.

I won't come here again, for $20 dollar I rather ate something else"}
{"text":"The drink itself is pretty bland n artificial, barely any taste tbh. Grass jelly doesn't taste like anything at all.

Washroom was really dirty n disgusting, to my surprise there was poo on the toilet paper...Just nasty."}
{"text":"Place is great and well clean. The dishes are really delicious and special. Service is wonderful, gotta say it is a absolute place to meet friends. Gonna come here often!"}
{"text":"Clean & cozy seating area for bbt and dessert. Got the A Lemon & taro sago - both were good! Didnt have the chance to try the dessert but would give it a shot if im in the area again. Like the decor and comfy seats in the store."}
{"text":"Three for the service!

Came here with a friend Tuesday night and was surprised with the line up. Little did I know, the line up was mostly due to long wait times for food and drinks. You have an option to dine in or take out and we went with the first one. Some tables were not cleared and it looked like they're still getting the hang of things as one of the tables had an opened box that originally contained an Interac machine. 
My friend and I ordered the Taro Sago Milk Tea and the Grass Jelly Milk Tea. Sadly, I forgot about the option to adjust sugar and ice levels but then again, I'm usually asked that when I'm ordering. My drink came before my friend's even though I've ordered a good 3 minutes after her. It didn't taste terrible but definitely would've preferred it to be less sweet (saving the calories!) As for my friend, she got the short end of the stick - her cup was sticky, drink was warm when asked for no ice, and the sago was missing. She then went back to ask for another one and still wasn't satisfied, mainly because of the taste and the sago. However, we are happy that they made a brand new one instead of just adding sago into her original drink. 
This store does have potential to improve and a conscientious manager (or management team in general). One of the employees went around to check on tables and apologize for wait times and unsatisfied orders. When he approached our table, he informed us that he covered the bill for us - shocker really! In addition, he offered us samples of the Coconut Pudding, which is made with coconut water. This was probably one of the best items of the night and I will probably come back to purchase it (note: its served in a real young coconut). 
Another plus was the spacious seating area of which is pretty absent from other bubble tea shops in the plaza."}
{"text":"Fantastic service I have ever, don't want anyone to miss a place like DIMPLES. And as well, they are going to serve some more wonderful dessert this month, I can't wait to try them."}
{"text":"A little bit over priced for what they serve...Zen Q would be a better option instead. When you order 30% sweetness it is equalivant to 50%. A little too sweet for my taste. They do have some card games for groups of friends...it would be better if they have more games..to make up for the higher price.."}
{"text":"What I ordered:
Hand made pearl golden oolong tea latte. The drink comes with their hand made tapiocas. I wanted the cactus flavor but was told the drink comes with all the different tapioca flavors.  Awesome! Customized the drink with 50% sugar and less ice. 

What I got:
Disappointment in a cup. 
There was no tea flavor. Just watered down milk and sugar. They did get the 50% sugar right.... I guess.. And less ice = no ice apparently. My drink was cold still, so since I could not taste the oolong, I must have gotten no tea or cold diluted tea. 
Rose pearl, matcha pearl, crystal pearl, purple sweet potato pearl, pudding pearl, cactus pearl, brown sugar pearl. That's a lot of different tapioca flavors you can get excited about. Well guess what? They all taste the same. And they all taste like nothing. Could not tell which color was associated to said flavor. Did not even bother to figure it out. Major let down. 

Gone is Presotea which made some good bbt, and replaced by Dimples, which makes a pretty cruddy drink. Good luck competing with all the other more established bbt chains just steps away. 


What others ordered:
-drinks
-typical Chinese desserts (grass jelly, sago etc)
-chicken and waffle

What others got:
Their drinks didn't sound anywhere as poorly made as mine, but it wasn't great either. 
Their desserts, portion-wise, must have been a joke. Who serves a half full bowl of desserts? Taste? Meh. 
Chicken and waffle never came. When we followed up, we were told they do not have the ingredients anymore. 
What I think? These guys/girls were too lazy to make anything Friday evening so they would have less to clean up when the store closes. They totally mailed it in, just like everyone else who didn't want to work on Fridays. 

Overall: 
Nice interior. Service was slow.  The waitress was at least knowledgeable about the menu and provided customer service. 
1.2 stars for this visit. That's right.. 0.2. Dimples did just a bit better than Hui Lau Shan across the parking lot."}
{"text":"Was excited for Dimples to open and see how they compare with the other 4-5 bubble tea spots already in the same plaza. What makes Dimples different is that they provide snacks and desserts at well which makes it a great place to study and hang out.The place is quite clean and nicely decorated.

There were many drinks I wanted to try off their menu but they ran out of homemade tapiocas by 6:30pm which was quite disappointing. I ordered the matcha latte and with regular sugar and it tasted okay. There wasn't much matcha flavour or any flavour actually even when I didn't change the sugar levels. The drinks were also a little on the pricey side since their cups on tall but very narrow compared to other bbt places."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a Sugar Marmalade or any Taiwanese style dessert place. The menu items are almost exactly the same (even the names) and there's nothing special about it. I went here on a Sunday night and it wasn't busy. Service was good and the prices are reasonable.

Creme Brulee ($5.99)
I ordered this item and it was an average creme brulee. A little on the runnier side and not sweet. The sugar coating on the top still had some white sugar grains on the side and it wasn't a thick enough layer to offset the not-so-sweet custard. 

Watermelon Slush ($5.49)
This slush wasn't particularly good. Wasn't sweet enough for my liking probably because the watermelon was under ripe.

Dimples Treasures Golden Sago ($6.99)
The mango was a little bit sour (not ripe) which kind of spoiled the dessert. We had to wait around 20 minutes because the tapioca wasn't ready.

I wouldn't recommend this place unless you're really craving some dessert and there's nothing else open in the plaza."}
{"text":"We decided to grab a bubble tea after catching a flick. The parking in the plaza at Leslie and Highway 7 can be a bit daunting at this time, with one fellow in a Geo resting on the horn behind me as I waited for someone to exit their parking spot. Dimples is a fun spot, which the server advised opened in September 07 and offers some unique nibbles to accompany it's own take on bubble tea. I'm no expert, but the 'Dimples Milk Tea' was quite good, not overly sweet, and Mango Tea had real mango bitz and natural flavour. 

In addition to the teas, we ordered some nibbles for the table, such as freshly made Squid Balls and Popcorn Chicken. But the best was this enormous mango pancake stuffed with whipped cream. Easy on the carbs there! All 5 of our shared it and the other items. The Squid ballsz were good, but I noticed no sauce was offered up, which I was surprised as I saw it in other photos. Oh well. 

The service folks I believe are still getting their bearings  towards efficiency. The items were brought out piecemeal and with large time gaps in between, including the drinks. They may have been short staffed, but I did notice other reviews commenting on service. I feel this deficiency can be resolved with increase in staff and training. 

Next time, we will definately grab one of those complementary games to play. It's a fun spot to hang out in and enjoy a snack after the show!"}
{"text":"Had time to kill and noticed on my way to Commerce Gate that Dimples has finally opened! I thought they were opening one as well in North York, I guess I remember wrong 

Replacing the cafe de Causette and Wanda, I feel the location has gotten so much bigger and brighter than the predessors after complete renovation.

Dimples is an order and pay for your items at their counter. They offer BBT, hot appetizers such as fried Taiwanese chicken, smoothies, desserts such as waffles and even durian pancakes! lots of items to choose from!

 Since i was going to have dinner soon, i just decided to get their signature Dimples Milk Tea (comes with tapioca). I must said their BBT drink is pretty good and decent size for $3.99. I am a fan already.

Since it just opened, it isn't very busy.. so if u are looking for a relaxed place to hang out with friends, this might be it ..for the time being 

In terms of seating and space, this new place trumps all BBT places in this plaza.

- One: there's actual seats!

- The place is big with about 45 seats and lots of tables to chill and hang out.

- The seats are more comfortable than i thought.

I didn't see any opening specials but I did see they were offering 20% discount for some people.

I did inquired whether they had FB or IG but since they just opened, there isn't none yet. The owner also added that beginning of next week, they will offer the new hand made pearl milk tea. 

Verdict: I would go back to check out their food & desserts."}
{"text":"Dimples recently opened up, replacing the previous BBT joint (which replaced Wanda's before it). My first impressions of the place were positive; comfy seats, decent background music to tune out, and solid bubble tea. Their Dimples milk tea was a bit too sweet, but the staff are very accommodating and friendly. I came on a lazy Sunday at 2pm, and sat down to enjoy some BBT and complimentary wi-fi. Overall, it has all the things I like about a BBT cafe."}
{"text":"Firstly, I have been to this plaza numerous times but I never noticed this place called Dimples. They make their own tapioca here with so many different flavors. You unfortunately cant pick which flavor you want. You get a medley of all of them. I dont mind since I get to try out all of them this way.

Its also more than a BBT place. They service typical Taiwanese desserts like sago and rice dumplings. The menu seemed pretty big for a BBT place. Tried out the mango sago one. My mistake. Mangoes are not in season so it was kind of sour. 

Overall, I like Dimples because the milk tea was really good and I like all the varieties of the tapioca balls. 3.5-4 stars ****"}
{"text":"Was craving for bubble tea and desserts, decided half heartedly to go here.  As i have my faves and prefer quality teas and fresh juice. No wait, tables available, cant be thaaat bad...wrong. 

Ordered a black milk tea, mango juice w tapioca and a red bean drink. My sister was craving dessert and saw a poster of a cream cheese bun, 8.99. Ok. Drinks come and the tapioca was somewhat hard, mango juice fresh but not sweet. Cream cheese bun came, literally a slice of pannettone bread with cream cheese spread, on a plate decorated with 2 dollops of whipped cream and sprinked with icing sugar..for the cost of 9.99, which is what they were charging at the cash, had to point out to their poster, which showed 8.99..looked nothing like what we had. 

Considering that there are much better bbt places in this area, poor choice on my part, please dont make it yours."}
{"text":"I ordered a taro sago milk tea less sweet less ice. I think it would be perfect for people who likes taro, sago and milk tea. I think mine was still a little too sweet even I asked for less sugar. The owner was very nice to give us a small sample of a coconut pudding to try while we were waiting for our drinks and I would definitely go back to try that pudding. He said it comes in different flavour as well like mango. He said no extra sugar added in the pudding. The cheese bun looks creamy and would love to try that the next time."}
{"text":"Ok, lets start off with the good.
The place is spacious and had a good amount of seats left on a friday night. Service was polite   and the aesthetic of the place is pretty cute. 
BUT.. the desserts suck. 
We ordered the black glutinous rice with papaya and sago w/coconut milk & durian.
The amount of filling you get is ridiculous.. like for $5-6 i would expect my bowl to be a bit more full.. especially since I know for a fact that the glutinous rice and sago are not that pricey. It's really disappointing because other dessert places like sugar marmalade give a much larger portion with an adequate amount of filling & fruit. 
4 tiny scoops of papaya.... and my tiny tiny tiny \"plop\" or durian. 
i'll stick to sugar marmalade. 
I would recommend everyone to steer clear of the desserts. 
I have heard some good things about the snack menu, so i MIGHT be back... but i don't know i'm pretty damn salty about my durian sago."}
{"text":"With the marketing flooded with bubble tea, there is alot of competition in this section to try to stand out. Dimple is a new place that took over the last bubble tea place that didn't fair so well. Thinking that it's arrangement was more for people to hangout to work a little in the later afternoon, we decided to go there for a drink, snack and get some work done.

Since this is a review on a resturant, let's talk about the drink and food. The drink compare to what we can get at commercial was the same if not worse. The matcha red bean milk was short on the tea flavor with too much millk. So was the dimple hand made 7 colors pearl. Same thing, too much milk. I must say the save grace was the tapioca and the popcorn chicken. The popcorn was decent and was served properly.

So at this point, you are think, with that, it should be at least a 3 stars. But why, why 2 stars only. What pushed this review to the bottom was the atmosphere. Simply put it, no investment was put into renovation. The new owner only bought some new wall and new table and chairs. The sound system was dismal and was just pumping out noise. The decor did not offer any sound retention causing the room to become much louder with only a few table full. 

At the end of the day, bubble teas are good for 2 things: 1. buy it and leave, 2. sit down, relex, and have a drink. Dimple kinda sat between the 2 and not good at either.

Sorry, but this is disappointing."}
{"text":"After seeing this place on Yelp, I was surprised that there was no hype or even mention of this new BBT place as usually everyone is all over new places in Markham. 

I now see why. Lol. 

I mean I really love their branding, the aesthetics of their room, EVERYTHING visually about this place makes me want to love it. Unfortunately, their milk tea is really not up to par with all the big players in the commerce gate plaza. What I can see was that it was also a cafe for desserts and small food, but really we were there to taste the BBT so I can't vouch for that. They touted all these colourful tapioca with different flavours and we really hyped ourselves up, to then get our hopes crushed by them saying that all their tapioca is sold out. It's 6:30pm. On a Sunday. Cmon. I would say their most unique selling point would be that, so to be sold out of it is very disappointing. 

I ordered just a regular milk tea and it wasn't that great. It was quite milky rather than silky like Coco and I ended up not finishing the drink. My other friends drinks were only okay as well. Perhaps if they rebrand themselves to a study spot rather than a sit down restaurant, I think they would have success there as the place is really pretty. I hate writing mediocre rated reviews as the service was not bad and the owner was there, but mediocrity doesn't cut it in Markham anymore, especially when it comes to BBT!!!

3/5. Maybe come back for desserts, but won't come back for BBT unless they have the rainbow tapioca."}
{"text":"it's a Saturday night hanging out with my friend. We thought about going to a cafe to spend some time. We were attracted by the dimples cafe because the large bright yellow logo caught our eyes in the plaza. So we decided to give a try. And it was amazing how inside looks as good as seeing from outside. The seating area is nice and clean. The chairs are really comfortable compared to others cafe I've been to. We order coconut pudding, and mango pancake. Those two are really delicious. The most great thing that we could play cards here. It's definitely a good place to hang out with your friends. We would come again:)"}
