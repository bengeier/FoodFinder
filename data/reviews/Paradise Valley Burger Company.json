{"text":"Deeeeeeeeeeellllliiiissssshhhhhh!  More than a pleasant surprise, it's a super tasty delight. I expected yummy food and well, this was.....*sigh*.... ahhhhhhhhhhhh.  Regular fries were seasoned so well, burgers juicy, each item we tried had it's own flavor but blended really well together. Fresno chicken tacos....zing creeps up on you, paired with the sweetness of the carnival corn....more aaaahhhhhhs.  And the french toast fries.....OMG so good! Stop reading this and go there already (bring your friends and order different things so you can try it all)."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town hands down. Presentation is an art form here. There service makes you feel at home. I love stopping by when I'm on this side of town. Very excellent experience all the way around every time."}
{"text":"our first time here with a couple of friends, we all loved every bite! delicious & creative menu, definitely something different and a new favorite!"}
{"text":"What great burgers!  Burgers are very unique.  I got the brûlée burger which had burnt sugar on the bun and a fried egg.  Very cool!  The French toast fries were pretty greasy and over cooked but had potential.  Overall great place."}
{"text":"Had the beach house burger, which was really, really good.  Green chilies made it awesome.  Fries are crispy and seasoned, real delicious.  I work nearby and I know I'll be coming here for lunch repeatedly."}
{"text":"I am always on the lookout for a good, local, friendly place to eat with great food that is vegetarian-friendly, and I found it with Paradise Valley Burger Company. The food is fresh, high-quality, and delicious. They have items that are tasty with a bit of a twist, like their tater tots made from sweet potatoes. The veggie tacos were delicious, and my son devoured the breakfast sandwich. Their service is personal and attentive, and the owner himself came to check on our food and our experience. I love patronizing and supporting local businesses, so I'm happy to have this place in my neighborhood. I wish them continued success. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"By far one of the BEST burgers I've had in a long time. great atmosphere everyone works there are super down to earth. really nice people and there may be one popping up over at the Scottsdale air park soon  my fingers are definitely keeping my fingers crossed for that!"}
{"text":"OMG! So fresh and innovative... great tasting hamburgers. Such neat choices too! You have to go and experience it."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers here, you cant go wrong. Great tacos as well and an incredible selection of milk shakes."}
{"text":"The food here is sooo good and the prices are cheap! I love their tacos! And the people that work there are very nice! I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Just happen to stop by this place and very surprised by the good quality of food.  My burger had a perfectly toasted bun and the quality of meat was excellent. I also order ed some of their homemade potato chips and they were excellent as well. The owner is a former chief at some very high end restaurants in Scottsdale and it shows  I will be back"}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down the best burger and fries - truly in a category of its own - you can't compare to ANY other burger, anywhere!!   Fun environment, great personalities here, and even tho at first I thought it was a bit pricey - well, have you looked at the price of burger at the grocery store lately!??   This is worth it!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and fries! Shakes are Even better. This place is such an epic hole In the wall. The lucky charm milk shake is so good. I have tried numerous places around Phornix, the stand, shake shack, and this place is better. Very simple and no frills, the basic bacon cheeseburger is one of the best with how they prepare it with their own twists. They taste even better if, prior to visitation, you smoke some Animal Cookie OG.   : )"}
{"text":"This was place was one of the best hamburger places ever! My husband and I went last night with our kids (ages 4 and 8) and everyone left happy and full! We don't usually go  to new food places with the kids, but after reading the reviews we knew we had to try it. I am really glad we did, we will definitely be going back. Although next time I am going to try the Lucky Charm Milkshake."}
{"text":"I love stopping by this place, even if I get just one thing. The brûlée burger is my drug of choice here, it's so damn good. The bacon and onion with burnt sugar really adds a great and unique flavor to the burger, definitely my favorite part."}
{"text":"The food looked amazing. But there was no where to sit so we did not stay. They need to expand to a bigger building or figure out a way for more people to be able to sit and eat. The tables were way to close together. I am not a fan of chatting with the strangers sitting next to me. Burgers get cold way to fast to take them to go. I prefer eating them fresh. I will maybe give them another chance if they expand or move to a larger location."}
{"text":"Obsessed. I've been vegetarian for years, my meat eating boyfriend brought me here(he's been going since high school!). I tried their pulled vegetarian sandwich and I'm hooked!! Now I crave it regularly. We moved 25 minutes away and still go."}
{"text":"Best burger place in town!!  Do not hesitate to stop and have some lunch or dinner.  North Phx secret little burger joint.   DELICIOUS is an understatement.   Brûlée Burger or Beach House Burger....mmm"}
{"text":"Went due to number/rating of reviews and specifically because of the feature on Triple D. I got the show featured \"country fried\" with seasoned fries and my girlfriend got the brûlée with sweet potato tot's.  The patties were small, similar to a breakfast sausage patty. The country fried had no cheese and was 3/4 tomato and onion straw** see photo containing no patty left. The burger was bland and as mentioned by others the gravy on the side was runny like ranch. (So much so that we were dipping Tots in it before realizing.) The Brûlée had similar characteristics build-wise but was better tasting.   Fries and tots were below average but were hot. They mixed up our fry/tot order but not that big of a deal I guess.   All in all I won't be back. My girlfriends food wasn't awful but mine was. I can't imagine it making a tv show because it wasn't anything special. For $30 with tip I'm severely disappointed. Oh well, live and learn, hopefully I can help someone else with making their dinner choice."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place. Very casual. Friendly  Good burger and good prices.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time 2 weeks ago. Wow!!! Great service and amazing burgers and fries. Yum!"}
{"text":"The service here was wonderful, really friendly and personable. And the food was OUTSTANDING! That Brulee burger was perfection, paired with some fries and a marshmallow shake. I wanted to stay in town another day, just to come back here to eat!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best  burger joint on Phoenix, AZ! Let me start with food. You walk in and  see large photos of the most beautifully designed burgers imaginable.You see the promotional pictures for the food served at the restaurant and yeah the food looks exactly if not better than advertised! These are not just thrown together patties. They are works of art! Any culinary professional would be more than impressed. I have not even gotten into the best part yet... These burgers taste even better than they look.   Each of their signature burgers is unique in test and design. I was impressed that the could make a bacon and fried egg cheeseburger exponentially more delicious then somewhere burgers I've had in the past. But they did. The Brule Burger was the first burger i ordered over a year ago and i have been a happy customer since!  What truly makes this restaurant more unique is that the future at least one brand new custom burger special each week. All of which are again culinary masterpieces. another great thing about Paradise Valley burger company is that they don't only sell burgers. They also have a wide array of tacos and sandwiches. No I have not taken advantage of there vegetarian and gluten free options they also happily serve these options.  Lastly, the initial thing that made me want to come back other than the tasty food was the amazing customer service. Owner and General Manager Brent and Brian we're very cool and sociable. I have been eating at their restaurant frequently for over a year and they still ask each time how my meal is. That means a lot.   I have brought many friends to eat here and I love it. I have also had a few business lunches here. That is how great the environment is inside Paradise Valley burger company."}
{"text":"Ok, this is my second review, but I had to update!  We've been back here dozens of times now and the owners always remember us and our order. They even remember little details about our lives which is awesome and always adds to the experience.  About the food: I didn't think it could get much better, but it does! I still can't seem to order anything but the Beach House, but recently my partner ordered (and shared) their Bacon Cheeseburger with little fried onions and some BBQ sauce...it was incredible. I'm not a fan of bacon on a burger, but it was the perfect combination of fresh cheeses, bacon, tangy bbq, crisp tomato, toasted bun...seriously, one of the best burgers I've ever had.  Still in love with the freshly made chips. We bought a whole bag from them and they were delicious. If you haven't already made the trip out to them, DO IT! It's completely worth the drive if you aren't nearby."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is a bit of dive but in a good way!  We are so excited to have such excellent burgers right down the street.  I had a bacon cheeseburger with fried onions (so yummy).  From here on out we'll stick to more vegan choices like portobello burgers and tacos.    BTW - The place was packed but the food came out hot and fast.  Soooooo goooooood!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for dinner and everything was exceptional. We tried the Beach House Burger and the Paradise Bacon Cheese with Fried Onions. We loved both but our favorite was the Paradise Bacon Cheese. It was perfectly cooked and the bun didn't overpower the burger, nor did it disintegrate like a lot of buns do. We also tried the fries which were really good with a slightly sweet taste. When they heard it was our first visit they brought us a basket of French toast fries which were ridiculously good. Only issue we had was the lack of fountain soda but overall it was a great experience. We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"The Burgers and Fries are delicious here! The 3 star rating is due to them getting my order wrong each time I visit, which has been twice. The cook has trouble reading or something because the guy taking the order is performing his task correctly. After that.."}
{"text":"I've been going here nearly every week for the past two years. I love the service, food, and the overall amazing experiences I have every time I go in. If you live in phoenix this is the best hole in the wall burger joint to go to! I've seen this place grow in the past two years and I know it'll be around for a long time.   The owner is a talented chef and needs to be recognized for his work. Every time I go in I see nothing but happy faces shoving their faces into delicious burgers. The best part is he creates something new to try every week!!!    Everyone needs to try this place!!"}
{"text":"PLEASE go and try them!!  First of all the place is local which I love.  Then the burgers are delicious!  And let me tell you the buns are fab.  Get the house made chips instead of the fries (better to me).    I esp love the smoked mozzarella with bacon and jalapeno and ranch sauce...get it with everything (picked onions, cucumber, etc)  YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Always have to try out a Triple D spot when we are near one, so glad we did. Got there just before noon and there was just a short line. I got the Texas BBQ burger and loved it, I am not usually very adventurous when it comes to my food but ate it just the way it came with the chile pepper and slaw and wow I want it again."}
{"text":"PVB is great! In a central location ( near PV Hospital) the menu as something for everyone in the family. I had the Beach Burger whcih was cooked to perfection. The brioche roll was just toasted and still so soft. Meat was flavored perfectly and cooked like I like it. My friend had the Parmigiana burger which was loaded with homemade sauce and tons of cheese. If you want something different and an over the top experience go for the french toast fries!  I'm going to try the taco's next time or one of their salads. Great prices, satisfying portions and casual attire is great for anytime."}
{"text":"Excellent find!  There is nothing better than a mom and pop style hole in the wall restaurant with awesome food!  I got the Burger Parmigiana (marinara, mozzarella, basil on a brioche bun). I would definitely get it again.  Small inside but the food doesn't let that get in the way."}
{"text":"Wow... these guys have the right idea. Great ingredients put into a flavor explosion. I had the Burger Brulee...Fried egg, bacon, onion, burnt sugar, havarti. Fried egg on everything adds golden deliciousness... I also had the sweet potato tatter tots... First time I've ever seen them... nicely done. Would highly recommend and would return... BTW Paradise Valley Pizza company opened 3 months ago just a couple of doors down... that looks just as grand and flavor town explosion... keep it up...."}
{"text":"The food here is great and the prices are reasonable. If you are looking for a unique, gormet burger, this is the place. That said, the portions are on the smaller side."}
{"text":"We had the Sloppy Joe and a Pulled Pork sandwich. Both were very tasty. People that worked there were friendly and service was fast."}
{"text":"Buns are cooked to perfection, reasonably priced and nice staff. Burgers are good and fries are great! Might have to try a different combination on my burger but would definitely try this place again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped in to PVB after seeing it on Guy Feiri's Diner's, Drive-ins, and Dives on Food Network. It was delicious. The location is nothing fancy, and neither is the decor inside, but the staff was friendly, quick, and professional and the food was amazing.  I ordered the Burger Brûlée which had a fried egg, bacon, onion, burnt sugar, and havarti cheese, so far, I haven't had a better burger in Phoenix. As a side I also opted for the sweet potato tater tots, again, not disappointed. My coworker stayed simple and ordered the Paradise burger and fries, she said the burger was worth coming back for and I tried her fries and the in house seasoning they use is very yummy, no dipping sauce needed for flavor!  Looking forward to returning to explore the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"WOW! I got the Brulee burger after looking at the tips and I have to say, if it's not the best burger I have ever had, it's the best burger I have had in years to be sure. It has some crunchy sugar in it that is the most creative and exciting texture and flavor I have ever tasted in a burger. If you like a play on sweet and savory, you will freak out, order this burger for sure.   Shake was awesome, a lil small for $5.50, so this place is a lil spendy, but the quality is worth it. I will be back."}
{"text":"Now, I have an update for the previous issue I had and my unfortunate experience.  The owner, Bret actually reached out to me and after speaking I came in and BAM! Back to the old ways. GREAT FOOD, GREAT SERVICE, GREAT IDEAS. Texas BBQ burger was seasoned well, complemented with slaw, sauce and cheese. Sweet and salty fries and home made jalapeño ranch....perfect. I must say nowadays its very difficult to find an owner of a business who actually listens to his customers and practices that age-old business model that the customer is your greatest asset. Again, thank you for making a one of a kind burger with a one of a kind experience!   Gotta say, I've had a lot of rhe food on the menu. Everything was great, creative and filling. I had to post something on here though abiut the guy at the counter that was bald and had a beard. By far one of the most rude individuals I have ever had the displeasure of interacting with. Friday afternoon, somewhat busy, and just gave off a horrible impression like he hated his job. Get over it and move on, otherwise, suck it up, smile and treat your customers with a little respect and gratitude, and some dang appreciation. Ordered a chocolate malt and 3 customers later, all treated with the same attitude hadn't even started it. Come on now, pure profit and customrrs and all you can do is sulk and ruin whatever business you have coming in by treating them and myself with such disregard? Hopefully this gets to someone who notices a common denominator with this guy and the reviews aimed at him."}
{"text":"Family and i and friends were visiting from the St. Louis area and were in the mood for some burgers so I found this place and it was off the chain amazing!! Lol.. The burgers were awesome, I had the paradise burger chz it was tasty! I never liked sweet potato fries BUT their sweet potato tots were to die for !! Over all this place was a great choice :-).. This is a must go when we come back to visit... Only thing is that I would take it to go, the place isn't really a din in .. Thanks for the great food we loved it!   ***Liana P.***"}
{"text":"meh.. I get it. It was on a TV show.  I went with a buddy for a quick lunch. Parking lot is classic west side - no one cleans up the trash - just filthy. The place itself is a classic hole-in-the-wall; kind of fun lighting, simple 'order at the counter'; all fun stuff.  What you realize is gourmet burger prices without the gourmet surroundings - an interesting mix. So, you are getting a very small piece of meat at about 8-10 per burger and the meat is killed - expect no juice from your meat.  We both ordered the Booze Burger - we are big men: 6 foot 6 and 6'10\" - we probably should have ordered 2. they were okay; nothing special and the meat by itself had no taste.  The toppings were extraordinary to put it out there. Overall, it just kind of did not say 'eat me again!'.  one order of fries - okay over salted but still some fun spices. good fries Sweet Potato tots - excellent  to coin a phrase from PULP FICTION - $5 milkshake, I have to have one of these $5 milk shakes to see what a $5 milk shake tastes like - and it tasted damn good  solid choice on the milk shake  overall; we ate outside to enjoy the garbage flying around the parking lot that no one seems to care about (shame on all the business owners) and looked at each other and said there was no reason to return - zero return factor. but that $5 milkshake....  I do wish the business owners took pride in the business center and cleaned up once in awhile - it would not hurt to have all the owners pitch in and each spend one day a week picking up trash"}
{"text":"Firat time here. Came on the recommendation of a friend. Yummy country fried burger and sweet potatoentater tots for me, and my wife enjoyed her pulledn pork sandwich. A neat place for a good bite of food, a neighborhood gem indeed. We will be back."}
{"text":"I was craving some red meat. Not just red meat...a juicy burger. Fortunately in my neighborhood there is this yumtastic burger joint. I previewed the menu online and theoretically could have called in my order since I was taking it to go but wanted to check it out a bit longer. I had the Beach house burger (roasted green chili, smoked mozarella, and pico de gallo) and a side of carnival corn.Well, I was pretty hungry so I actually took some nibbles of my corn on the car ride home-very tasty. It was seasoned splendidly and was delicious. My burger was great. I LOVED the grilled green chili. It was extremely tasty with just the right amount of spice. I guess I am used to green chilis being kind of soggy but this was darn near perfect and very fresh. The burger is served on a brioche bun (which I didn't eat because that is how I roll with burgers..I don't eat the bread..could have ordered it protein style with lettuce but I forgot..the bun looked tasty though!  :) In addition to burgers they have sandwiches, tacos/taco salads, and some interesting sides. I definitely would like to try the sweet potato tots and a taco salad on my next visit. Next time my meat craving kicks in..I know just the place."}
{"text":"Incredible.  Gourmet burgers, should cost $15 each but they are selling it for $5. Number one place for burgers. Next I will try the chicken."}
{"text":"Burger was great! I love the fries and the seasoning. Just a little too much seasoning for my taste. But I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing! I am in shock with how stellar the customer service was! The food, my god it was delicious!!! I will definitely be back again! Yum!"}
{"text":"Well for a vegetarian, I liked this place! Our table had a grilled cheese, breakfast sandwich (this was the best), seasoned fries, and coleslaw. All that with 2 drinks was only $18. Great lunch/dinner stop. It is a hole in the wall kind of place but the staff was super \"chill\" and friendly. I will be back to try the other vegetarian options on the menu."}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers I've ever had! All the food is awesome - as is the service. Definitely try the Brûlée burger and French toast fries. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ok....WOW,   just  WOW!  I am not a hamburger freak so when my Hubby asked around and was told this was awesome, I just went along with him.  When you enter this unassuming small place, the guy at the counter asks if you have been there before.  Then he tells you what the most popular burger is (Brulee)..I did not want to think that day and just ordered the Brulee even though it did not sound good.  There was Soooo a party in my mouth.  It was AWESOME!  Hubby ordered a boring regular burger and he LOVED it too.  Their fries were seasoned and HOT.  They got a huge thumbs up, only thing that was not up to par with the rest was the homemade potato chips...kinda yucky..oh and the Carnival Corn was wonderful!  We will so be back!"}
{"text":"HOLY BURGER BATMAN.   I had a friend suggest that I needed to go here to try they're creme brulee burger. Now,  being a California native, I know a good juicy burg , so I am used to people telling me how \"awesome\" a burger is (smashburger, cough cough) and putting that charred beef on the foodie pedestal only to get knocked off and sorely dissapointed....this however is a different story.   This burger is legend....***wait for it****....DARRRRRYYYY.  the bun , a brioche buttery soft bun, caramelized with dusted sugar , topped with a juicy, mouthwatering hamburger patty, topped with a fried egg, shredded lettuce, thick crispy bacon, tart pickled onion and finally smothered with havarti cheese. I was a bit iffy about the egg afraid it might ruin it...but out of respect for the creators concept I tried it in its original form ...and oh am I happy I did. Don't touch the idea of Changing it...don't add ketchup don't add mayo just stuff that delicious burger in your pie hole where it belongs and enjoy!!!   Side note: this is a mom & pop or realistically two bros kinda place and I love that they are successful in this economy . Try it for yourself & Spread the word . BUY LOCAL!"}
{"text":"We tried their french toast fries, and their special burger of crabcake burger, sweet potato tatter fries, and their regular fries.    First of, customer service was wonderful. That's where the extra 2 stars comes from.  Burger patties was perfect. French toast is good, tatter fries is good.   The only let down was their burger crab cake. Although it has great quarter pounder burger patties, while combined together, the whole thing tasted like it was made by a cook than a chef. It was a great concept: the white sauce was a creative creation that sounds good on their chalk board but the way they made, unfortunately doesn't live up to the expectation; it was just bland. Crab cake was over fried, and bland too. Bun was not moist on the inside and savory on the outside, like the way it looks.    BUT... Guy Fieri was here so you may ignore my chatter above..."}
{"text":"Love it!! Unique menu items and everything tastes great. My daughter absolutely loves the lucky charms milkshake...marshmallows only!!!"}
{"text":"I fully recommend the french toast fries! For the vegetarians the Beach House with portobella is a good option."}
{"text":"This place got such great reviews but my husband and I left feeling no need to go back or to recommend to others. The service was great/friendly. But the burgers were very charbroiled which is not the way we like burgers. I got the house burger, which if you are going to go here I would try. We also tried the French toast fries which were unique but overrated. The pulled pork fries were good."}
{"text":"The place was clean, the staff was friendly and Tony made good recommendations. They handed us a menu and gave us plenty of time to figure out what to order. My wife got the Paradise with Cheddar and some sweet potato tots. I got the Beach House (Tony's rec) and some seasoned fries. Both burgers were fantastic. My patties were perfectly charred and I loved the toasted bun. Best part about it was that it was the perfect amount of food. Not one of these places and crams a gimmicky mound of food on your plate and makes you feel guilty for not finishing or like a total fatty if you do! I finished my burger without anyone twisting my arm to do so. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Phenomenally crafted burger with creative and unique flavor profiles that compliment each other perfectly. I can't eat burgers anywhere else now! I absolutely love this place! So creative and they're constantly coming up with new featured items so you never run out of things to try! Great customer service and I'm ALWAYS impressed with the food! Not to mention it's ALL at a great price! Consistently terrific!"}
{"text":"Had the Beach House burgers with fries - great food.  The burger was juicy and the combination of flavors was great.  Prices are fair.  It's nice to see local restaurants like this one in the neighborhood!  The Abrahams"}
{"text":"I've ordered twice now via Grubhub.  Both times, I received my order in less than 30 minutes.  The first time, while the food was reasonably good, it arrived cold.  Today I thought I'd give them another chance.  Sadly, again, my order arrived cold.  (And I had the added bonus of a 6\" piece of tied string included among my fries that appeared to have been fried, too.)  Perhaps they need different packaging for deliveries, since the reviews are mostly very good for in-restaurant orders.  Regardless, I won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Country fried burger? Hell. Yes. House made BBQ chips? Meh.  But I would kick a nun in the keester to get back to that burger. Luckily, it's close to me, so it's unlikely I'll need to resort to such measures. BUT I WOULD."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go and wish I had known about it way way sooner. They have the best milkshakes in town, sweet potato tater tots that are indescribable, and the burgers are always changing, always fresh, and tastier then the best burgers of their competitors put together! It's no wonder guy Fierri featured them on triple D"}
{"text":"Great food! We got shrimp tacos, veggie tacos, sweet potato tater tots, and a chocolate shake. Everything was delicious! We finished it all. The burgers looked tasty as well, so I am sure we will return!"}
{"text":"First time to visit! Had the Cinco Diablo burger with sweet potato tator tots, all I can say is yummmmmmmm!! What an explosion of flavor on the taste buds. Absolutely a must try.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff food is wonderful recommend the carnival corn very delicious.Saw this place on Guy Fieris show and it was as good as advertised.Overall we were very happy:)"}
{"text":"1st time here! Cute place inside.  Was very delicious and fast service. All the food was good and decent portions. Will go back!"}
{"text":"Love it! Don't think we ever had a burger as good as they make them. I have eaten here twice and both times were great. Didn't care for the sweet potato fries, but the burgers are worth it! I drove 1/2 hour to visit here a second time."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there for the first time.  Glad we stopped!  After only being open for 6 months these guys have it going.  We can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu.  Brulee Burger and the Beach House Burgers were both a hit.......and the fries!  10 different ingredients to shake on the fries!  Are you kidding?"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience. I've actually never had anything but a wonderful experience here. The Brûlée Burger is my favorite but there's other great ones to pick from. There's also always really good weekly specials.   There's a lot more than just burgers on the menu but it's impossible for me to not order a burger whenever I go. So, unfortunately, I can't comment on other items."}
{"text":"Ate here on advice of a friend who said it was a better burger than In N' Out. He was right, it was awesome! I love the fixings they put on their standard cheeseburger. Will dream about it and definitely be back! But I still love In N' Out!"}
{"text":"Best burger in North Phoenix, and rivals any burger I've had in town. Highly recommend, get some!"}
{"text":"The burger left a burnt taste in my mouth, and there wasn't any flavor. I got the Texas burger. I was pretty disappointed in my meal. When I paid the cashier tossed my card back to me on the counter. The place doesn't look very clean, and the drinks (like the Capri Suns) are labeled not for individual sale. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Concur with most of the reviews on Yelp - this place is fantastic.  You definitely get unique burgers, can get sandwiches or tacos, and they also have basic burgers for a very reasonable $5.  The sweet potato tots are really good.  The milkshakes are different but very tasty.  Think of shaved ice with a lot of ice cream, milk, and a ton of unique toppings like Lucky Charms.  There are some really nice small touches:  1) They play some really good music in the place at a reasonable noise level.  2) Their have a water \"jug\" if you want tap water, and it's flavored with cucumbers which really makes it refreshing.  The guys at the counter have been really friendly both times we've been.  The prices are reasonable and I really don't think there is a better burger option in the area.  Definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! Great customer service. Unpretentiously hidden in a strip mall kind of location. Don't let that deter you and your tummy will be glad"}
{"text":"A highly recommended neighborhood burger spot. Don't let the fact that it was featured on DDD worry you. The restaurant is small and basic, but looks are deceiving. The burgers are very upscale.   We visited recently with kids in tow. We enjoyed a deliciously toxic Lucky Charms shake, gooey French Toast fries, tasty sweet potato tots, kids cheeseburgers with ketchup smiley faces included, the feature Burger Brulee... who knows what else we ordered. All fantastic.  The counter staff is always helpful and friendly, which is key because the menu caulk board and specials can be confusing. Fellow diners are usually friendly as well, often a combination of regulars and DDD devotees. All in all, a great family outing."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the service. We had the Brulee Burger, Beach House Burger, and the tacos. All excellent. Prices are great for unique, good quality food. Can't wait to go back and try other menu items."}
{"text":"this was my first time here, you order at the counter.  There was a large group in front of me, but the line went very quickly.  This is not a large place which is unfortunate, as the burgers are fabulous.  Don't expect fancy, but don't let the ambiance deter you from trying the food here.  I had the Beach Burger which was fabulous, the ingredients on the burger were all fresh and appeared as if the green chiles were roasted right there.  The square bun was toasted to perfection.  I will return here again to try out their other burgers."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food here. The people working were friendly and seem to really enjoy where they work. Good quick burger joint."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 specials and it was about $20.  Thats $10 per burger with no side or drink. It was very good but $10 is crazy for one burger."}
{"text":"First time going to this hole in the wall burger joint and I have to say, one of the best burgers I've had in phx. I would highly suggest it to anyone in north Scottsdale. Bacon maple shake was good, tots are amazing and burgers are tasty. Check it out, don't be afraid!"}
{"text":"Ordered pick up a few days ago everything was delicious. The thing that surprised me the most was how good the fries were. Not sure what seasoning they use but HOLY COW yummy!"}
{"text":"The fries are a must, very impressed.  Good burgers too.  I went w the burger Brulee and was definitely pleased w it.  Will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"excellent tasty burgers!  People are great too.  Been there several times and  always top shelf.  not necessarily healthy mind you, but great tasting!  my fave is the brulee'  it is evil good!  :-)"}
{"text":"So delicious. I had the Shrimp Club and my buddy got the Hodad. The fries here are the BEST that I personally have EVER eaten. The seasoning blend is just spectacular and well balanced!  I watched the Triple D episode on Friday and had to visit. I drove from Gilbert to enjoy and people, I AM SO GLAD I DID!!!  I will be frequently coming up to try something new each time. Then owner and staff are super polite and took time out of his day to discuss his recent rise to fame with me. THAT'S SOLID!!!  You will not be let down!!"}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad burger yet! Every thing I've ordered has been delicious. First timer? Get the Brulee!"}
{"text":"We loved this place so much we went back twice over our one-week vacation in the Phoenix area!  If not for Yelp, we never would have walked in.  It's tucked away in an old strip mall, and the ambiance leaves a bit to be desired, but the food is amazing!  We especially loved the Brule burger and the French toast fries, but everything we tried was delicious.  If only we lived a bit closer..."}
{"text":"Love this place. I have been here a few times and food has always been excellent. Like the weekley specials. Owner super nice guy. In a little corner of a strip mall. Does not look mlike much from outside, but go in! You will be amazed"}
{"text":"Great burger! Very fresh tasting , lots of options for toppings, I will definitely go back when I'm craving a juicy, delicious burger.  The sweet potato tots and the vanilla malt were the icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in the valley. Awesome and unique flavor, which will make you want to come here again. I have tried the beach burger and the bbq one, and both of them were mind blowing. Cannot wait to try the rest."}
{"text":"Great, unique burgers.  Who would have thought cucumbers would taste good on a burger?  Fries were decent--I'd try plain next time. No beer or wine.  About three miles from the Musical Instrument Museum."}
{"text":"Not the worst burger, but absolutely not the best. Place is a little joint. Staff is great. We came at \"rush hour\" around lunch time. Line was out the door! I was impressed at the professionalism of the staff... The crowd didn't faze them! (good idea to call your order ahead of time) Nothing good or bad to say about what I had, just wasn't my taste.  With the crowd I thought I'd be phenomenal. With that being said, I was disappointed.  Paid $18.00 for two burgers and two fries which wasn't that good. Doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Really good burgers here!!! The customer service was quick, but in a very good way. I will definitely be back to support a local business."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a burger and we were blown away by the food, friendly staff, and atmosphere! Their menu is full of amazing choices, so I had a hard time choosing what to order. Both my boyfriend and I got a burger and some sweet potato tots which were amazing! We will definately be going back and I am so glad this is in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"First time here (yesterday) I had the beach house burger, was the best hamburger I have ever had.  Came back today for lunch and had the brûlée burger... New best burger I've ever had.  Didn't know a hamburger could do this to my taste buds."}
{"text":"PV Burger Company is the absolute best burger in AZ and is definitely at the top of my list for all-time best burgers.  The owner is great and helped me work through my tendency to stick to what I always order and try some of the specials and other burgers on their menu.  I love the jalapeno ranch and fried onions as well as the pickled onions and that brulee burger is definitely worthy of the praise it gets.  The shakes (good lord that maple bacon pecan) are amazing and the price is more than reasonable.  The only bad part is that it's within walking distance from home and I have a feeling I may go overboard, if that's possible.  I only wish they stayed open later; 8:00PM is just too early!  Seriously though, EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Beach house burger is the bomb. Chocolate shake is delicious, thick & rich. Prices are reasonable. Burgers like this would be twice as much where I live. Paradise Valley, you're spoiled! And this place is clean, especially the bathrooms. Very impressive for a strip-mall burger joint!!"}
{"text":"This place is SO good. I got the paradise burger with cheese and it was the best burger I've ever had, and the fries are really good and perfectly crispy. Even though there's a lot on the burger it doesn't fall apart like a lot of other burgers do. The people are friendly and fast for the amount of people coming in at one time. It's a small place and does take a little longer than the typical fast food place, but it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Paradise Valley Purger Co. Is a fun and interesting place to visit.  The staff is so nice and helpful, always looking for ways to make the guest feel like they are getting taken care of. As for the food I would say that it is good and worth stoping by but not the best I have ever eaten like some of the other reviews state. Don't get me wrong the food is good and worth going to try but not something that I would go out of my way for a second time.    We ordered the PV bacon cheese burger, brûlée burger, sweet tots, reg fries, corn, and French toast fries. The PV cheese burger was tasty all put together, the meat was ok might of benefited from some seasoning a bit but the toppings were the best part  they really made the burger. My husband had the brûlée burger he said burnt sugar made it a little bitter however he agrees the toppings really make the burger. It is the toppings that set this place out from the rest. As for the sides the tots were my favorite. The seasoning on the regular fries is a bit sweet and the corn smelled like gas and was really small for 1.95 like a 1/4 of an ear. But the French toast fries made up for it only 2 bucks and you get a bunch. Save room for these.   In all it was a good meal not expensive and we are satisfied. Would we go back maybe and would I tell others to visit maybe.  not the top of my list but still good. The staff was fun and that maybe the reason we go back.     PV Burger Co you do a great job for what you are, a dive burger place."}
{"text":"Good food! I have been there multiple time and have yet to been let down. Great job guys. Twinky Milk Shake was craaaaazy!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a burger. The Brûlée burger is outstanding. I was never a fan of an egg on a burger until the combination found in this burger. Their potato sides are good, don't miss out on the special sauces found in the cooler next to the register."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first experience!!! Love the portion size.. Burgers don't have to put you into a food coma to be good and this place proves it.. Went at lunch time around noon and were very busy.. still got served in a decent amount of time.. Definitely planning on going back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"My family's visiting Scottsdale so we decided to stop by here since we saw it on tv. I have to say that it was one of the best burgers I've ever ate. The only bad thing is that it is a little small but overall the taste and the meat is so fresh and good. I recommend everyone to try this place!"}
{"text":"Great burger spot for PHX. Unassuming location and exterior for the restaurant.  Hard to beat the Paradise Burger, but there are loads of specialty burgers for the adventurous.  Sweet potato toys are KILLER! The French Toast fries are also dangerous (in a good way).    If you're around...It's worth the calories!"}
{"text":"A little hole-in-the wall place. Wall-to-wall people. Very friendly staff. Great food and reasonably priced. A little bit of a wait and tough to find a place to sit, but worth it, and something on the menu for just about everybody. The seasoned fries were delicious - a lot like barbecue chips. Yum. We'll definitely come back here again if we make it back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers we've ever had!! I had the Texas BBQ burger and my husband got the Country Fried Burger and both were amazing! Great flavor and cooked just right. The seasoned fries were great too. Will definitely be coming back here- more burgers to try!!"}
{"text":"East Coast Foodie , awesome burgers. Thank you for bringing a unique place to Phoenix :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic food yet again!   Great combinations of ingredients to make a great burger!"}
{"text":"Love this place and come often. Don't waste your time ordering a simple cheeseburger- go all out with their amazing concoctions and you won't be disappointed. They are always the right amount of savory, spicy with a touch of sweet that just works right. And their milkshakes are the best. Everything tastes homemade because it is."}
{"text":"I had a serious burger craving and decided to try PVBC due to good Yelp reviews (thanks, Yelpers!).  They have an incredibly imaginative burger menu and some enticing sides (carnival corn, sweet potato tater tots). They even have real milkshakes! I wanted something basic and wasn't disappointed with my cheeseburger and fries.  It's a walk-up-to-the-counter and order setup and the young woman behind the counter (Kailey?) was amazing. She answered every question we had and made great recommendations, but it was her authentic enthusiasm that nailed it. Attention all employees: this is the type of person you want facing the customer! Overall a great visit. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I am a regular user of Yelp but this is the first time I felt compelled to write a review.  PVBC has several characteristics that stand out from the crowd. The main attraction is the food.  This is a \"burger joint\" with a huge twist that keeps on twisting.  There are photos of the menu items on the walls and online  that help to describe the \"creations\" of Bret, the owner/chef.  They don't look like boring burgers and they don't taste like them either.  The Brulee burger is built with a fried egg on top of bacon, onion, burnt sugar and Havarti cheese.  The Beach House has a half a roasted green chili, smoked mozarella, and pico de gallo.  And there are a few other specialty burgers as well as the standard cheeseburger available.  Then there are tacos and taco salads available in several styles, the pulled pork sandwich with green chili and smoked mozzarella, which I have tried and highly recommend, and the \"classic\" but not so typical sloppy joe.  All these sandwiches are served on an awesome bun that is toasted to perfection and come with a choice of \"special sauces\" like sweet-n-spicy, 1000 Island or jalapeno ranch.  How about fried,carmelized or pickled onions? Avocado, jalapenos, green chili, bleau cheese.... Here are some more twists:  the sweet potato tots, the homemade seasoned potato chips, the homemade natural cut fries, homemade coleslaw.  Everything is homemade.  Even more twists:  roasted corn on the cob and on my last visit on Saturday, there was on off-menu soup of the day that was an amazing homemade combination: sweet potato, jalapeno, bacon, and chicken. Now I can't wait to go again to try another menu item and see what  the soup of the day will be.  I end every visit there with a chocolate shake that I can honestly say is the best that I have ever had anytime anywhere.  My niece's chocolate peanut butter shake was great too! They make various flavors and offer malts as well as shakes.   So the food is the main outstanding characteristic and the low prices are the next surprising feature.  It is highly unusual to have so much fun and food for such a small price.  Next, did you notice that I spoke of Bret, the owner and chef, by name at the beginning of the review?  That is because in this quaint  \"joint\", he comes out to see how the eaters are enjoying the eats and is more than willing to chat about the food or anything else...a very cool young but experienced chef with a seemingly sole desire to please.   There is even a piece de resistance (French pronunciation intended). You must try the French toast sticks served hot with powdered sugar and maple syrup.  Bret brought out a sample on one of my first visits. They are the epitome of orgasmic food.  What a treat and a great desert to share !!  I write this review because I thoroughly enjoy and look forward to every  visit (and so does my wife and the friends that I have told) but also because I sincerely want the PVBC to become known and be successful enough to stay in the neighborhood.  Please try it for yourself and write about your experience.  There are more menu items to try and I hope I can get a chance to try them all, not to mention the new ideas that Bret is always testing.  He even caters his stuff."}
{"text":"I love Paradise Valley Burger Company. I moved out to Arizona from Chicago and finally found a place where there are good burgers and fries. Try the Burger Brûlée, you will not be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"A great find while in Phoenix on a trip.  The burgers and fries were top notch, and my son had the signature brûlée burger that really is unique with an egg on top and carmelized sugar toasted into the bun.  Finished off a fine meal with the lucky charm shake, which was max sweetness.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in a while!  Also got the peanut butter and fudge milkshake that was incredible! Everything was so good here! Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Best burgers that I've had in Phoenix. Absolutely amazing. You are cheating yourself if you live in North Phoenix and haven't been here at least 10 times yet. The Beach House and the Burger Brulee are the classics here, but make sure to ask about the weekly special. Sometimes they have some real gems that aren't on the menu. The milkshakes are also particularly good, my personal favorite being the Lucky Charms milkshake."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I found this place on yelp. We've been coming back ever since. She usually gets the country fried burger and i always try their burgers that are on special. Food is always on point and the service great. If you are looking for a laid back joint with great food, Paradise Valley Burger Co. is the joint to be at!"}
{"text":"Where to start??!   My wife and I began our meal with a peanut butter shake which tasted like a reeces buttercup in shake formation.  It was heavenly.  Then we had the specialty burger which was a cheeseburger bacon special sauce and a bunch more goodness.  She had something similar.  Both burgers were amazing and not expensive at all!   Then we had some French toast fries for dessert.   This place is totally unassuming.  Little place in a little strip mall but soooo good."}
{"text":"What a burger place. Had the Brûlé Burger & seasoned fries. Just a great burger & the guys behind the counter were outstanding. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to get a burger. Never been dissapointed by these guys. They are always polite and the burgers are always fresh, and the seasoning on the fries that they use is amazing.  Love coming here"}
{"text":"I agree with a few of the last reviews.  We have been there several times and had great food but, we went last night, after having not been there for over a year and it seems to have gone downhill a bit.  The burger had this burnt taste and not the good char flavor but that bad burnt flavor you can't get out of your mouth.  The fries were so over-seasoned it was like I stuck my tongue in the season mix.  I was there with my husband and son and none of us could eat them.  My son, who usually inhales burgers, left a quarter of his and said he didn't like it. The tables were sticky, the floor was dirty and the paint needs a refresher.  It's old enough that it needs a facelift (especially the nasty ceiling tiles...maybe take those out and go for the more modern loft look with the ceiling open and painted black). Hope the owners can take a step back, take a look around, clean the place up and go back to the basics of good food."}
{"text":"Exactly what we needed. In town for a few days and we heard about this place plus the kids love any DDD spots so we dropped in.   Ordered the same items that were on the show and we were not disappointed. The lucky charms milkshake was very good as was the burgers. Overall the experience was great and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"There's nothing that can be said in this review that hasn't been said a million times on this Yelp page already. Everything is fantastically delicious (better than In-N-Out, even) in the \"this is good food\" way, NOT in the \"I will pretentiously like this because it is different and seemingly fancy/low-class, even though it's actually not very good\" way.  The guy at the counter when I've been has been friendly, helpful, and polite.  The place is clean. The prices are beyond reasonable.  Look, if you see a place with an overwhelming quantity of five-star reviews, you're going to either (A) jump in headfirst, or (B) be super-suspicious. But when the worst review is that only SOME of the food was really good (which is what I saw in the three low-star reviews on here, and I'm counting three stars as low to bring that count up from the one person who, for some reason that I can't comprehend, gave this place a two), it's worth a try.  And when you walk in and stand gawking at the menu and three patrons who are happily wolfing down their meals tell you, unsolicited, to try the brulee burger, the sweet potato tots, or anything else on the menu, listen to them.  You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Good unique burgers. Love their frys. This was my second time eating there. The place is not fancy but the burger was amazing. I would recommend the frys and tots. Must have burger. Will be back"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Allot of restaurants these days focus on just presentation and service and loose sight of having amazing food. Not here! The food is too good!!! I am now a regular. I typically order the Brûlée burger because nothing compares but I have also had the shrimp tacos and steak tacos.  My girlfriend is vegetarian and she loves the veggie sandwich! Everything is so flavorful! the sweet potato tots and fries are delicious and always so fresh. If you are a lover of sweets like myself, do yourself a favor and try the french toast fries! you're welcome ;)"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had in a long time!!! Their fries are bombdotcom too!!! Wishing we had something like this in Anchorage, Alaska."}
{"text":"If I could give it 6 stars I would. One of the best burgers I've eaten. I can see why they were featured on food network. will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu! !!!!!! If you haven't tried the paradise burger I would suggest you make a pit stop."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, not awesome location, but not a terrible location either. Friendly service, although I typically take my food to go, so not sure about dine-in. Loved the sweet potato tots...so delicious!"}
{"text":"I am a total sucker for a \"burger joint\" and this is one of the best. I kept hearing about PV Burger from friends all over town so had to try it and it exceeded my expectations. The burger bule was heavenly - who knew an egg on a burger would be so awesome?"}
{"text":"I have had several recommendations to try this place over the years and finally had an opportunity to try it when my husband was up in the area for some family stuff.  While it was not the most ideal way to try a PVBC burger but that was my opportunity.  I had the fries and cheeseburger with all the fixings and honestly felt it was one of the best burgers I have had in a long time, even after a 45 minute car ride.  You can judge all you want, but I don't mind when the burger is a little more on the done side (I am not a fan of blood), so the fact that it sat for a car ride did not bother me.  It was still juicy, a decently thick patty that almost covered the bun and was very tasty - I loved tasting all the different ingredients in every single bite.  Pickled onions in the burger gave it the little zing I normally do not expect and it was completely welcome.    The FRIES.  Despite being lukewarm, I loved the seasoning on the fries.  My husband was not thinking (he had been at the hospital with a family member for 6 hours so I understand he was zombie-like) and only purchase one order when he should have just gone for two.  I liked the cajun-like spice on the fries with just a hint of sweetness.  I dipped them in ketchup and the jalapeño ranch my husband had picked up for me to dunk my burger in (yes, I am a sauce girl, and yes, I do tend to have several sauces if the variety is there).  Both combinations were great but I was perfectly happy to scarf the fries down just as they were.  I love McDonald's fries (yes, keep judging) and like that they are just slightly crispy and chewy on the outside but the potato is pillowy soft on the inside.  These not only had that consistency (exponentially because of their car ride), they also had yummy seasoning on it as well.  My husband and I had to play rock, paper, scissors for the last few and lucky for me, I won (no, he did not let me win and yes, he did end up stealing a fry which earned him a smack on the hand).  I think between the time he walked in the house to the last fry was about 8, maybe 10 minutes.  Most of my family and friends and even coworkers know how slow I eat.  The fact that I hoovered the burger and fries down leads me to two truths: 1) I was really hungry after a long day at work, and 2) that was a damn good hamburger and side of fries.    I was disappointed I couldn't try the famed Brûlée burger as I didn't want to risk the yolky goodness drying up.  A few days later we had to be in the area again and I had a golden opportunity to see this place in person.  Our second visit in a week yielded the Brûlée burger for me, two orders of fries (one regular, one sweet potato tots), and a cheeseburger for my husband.  The Brûlée burger was really good - the caramelized sugar on the bun went against every fiber of my being as I do not like mixing flavors, especially sweet and salty in an entree.  However, I felt like it gave the burger such a special flavor profile that I understand why it is there.  Same fixings (love me those pickled onions) and the crowing glory for me, a beautiful over easy egg.  I love over easy eggs, especially when I have something to sop up the yolk (this is graphic, so advert your eyes if you like your eggs completely cooked).  Unfortunately, this burger had a lot of liquid going on, from the patty to the condiments, to the egg.  I ended up giving up after the bun started dissolving a few bites in and kept the food going with a fork and a knife.  It allowed me to make sure every bite had all the main elements (important in my book), and appeased the OCD side of me that does not like having dirty hands.  The fries were even better fresh and I hardly used any sauce with them simply because I loved the seasoning so much.  The sweet potato tots were also really good - so good that my husband, who doesn't normally like them, tried to steal all of them. All in all, a solid first physical visit to PVCC.   Some things to note: it is definitely small and can get crowded.  When we walked in at 5pm, there was only one table with one chair by the door, leaving us to find two more chairs (for my husband and the baby's carseat).  Ambience was super loud but I think it was mostly due to the large party in the middle of the restaurant and the gaggle of kids next to us who were glued to their phones and trying to best each other in loudness.  Once the kids and supervising parent had gone and the large party finally, mercifully left, the restaurant chilled out.  It was still a little loud as they have music and the TV going, but losing 15 people to the Arizona heat made it a lot more bearable.   While I plan to come back again in the area, I felt the fries were a pretty small portion for the price.  $3 for about 1/2 to a 1/3 cup of fries was kind of depressing. I also wanted to point out that while I loved the softness of the bun, the disintegration while eating was not fun.  The meal was about $30 without drinks so definitely an occasional treat."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! I was looking for Crème brûlée--the dessert here on yelp, and the first thing that popped up was this place. Of course, I had to go and try the brûlée burger, and it was AMAZING! I have gone about five times, and everything is soooo delish! It is a little hole in the wall burger place, that I sure did miss each time I would drive by. It is in a small shopping/center that consists of just a few establishments.  Everyone is always super nice there, and I love the atmosphere! It is so laid back and they always have the best weekly specials! It is in my neighborhood, so this is my new burger place!   If you want to try a unique hamburger, I really recommend this place! I have recommended this place to about four friends so far, and they have all loved the place, and recommended more people!"}
{"text":"Great? No so much. They have interesting combinations for their burgers, but they are not burgers that I would go out of my way to eat again. I ordered two burgers and a bbq sandwich. The simplest of the burgers, PV burger, was the best of the two. The bbq pork was a miss. The pulled bbq pork is served between two slices of toast that just can't handle that much sauce. Oddly, the burgers are not filling. The seasoned fries, are fries dusted with bbq powder, the seasoning much like bbq potato chips. Our orders had so much of this salty seasoning that we had blow/ wipe each fry to free it from the salt.   Long wait time for the food. Nothing stood out that would make me want to visit again."}
{"text":"A very small place with AMAZING burgers. The staff is friendly and happy to recommend food in the menu. I had their specialty, it was a yhe best burger I've had in a long time"}
{"text":"Best burger in town, cannot go wrong with this place.  Have been coming here for a while and food has always been consistently superb."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! I've driven past this place on my way to work for ever, finally stopped by and am so glad I did. They also have great malts. I would definitely recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"The burgers were tasty, but definitely not \"the best I've ever had.\"  They were also very, very tiny.  I noted that the patties were 1/4 lb before grilling, but I imagine they are also 70% lean because the total weight of my brulee burger could not have been more than 1/4 lb including the bun, egg, cheese, \"fixings,\" and bacon.  With a price tag of $8, it should be more substantial.  I got my husband the bacon + cheese, which was standard and we shared the seasoned fries.  Even though neither of us was incredibly hungry when we arrived, we felt utterly unsatisfied by our $20 \"meal\" at PVBC.  Thus - and we have never done this in 8 years together - we stopped in to Isa's and picked up a slice of pizza each (for the reasonable total of $5).  I was also craving a milkshake but didn't want another sad letdown at PVBC, so we went across the street to Jack-in-the-Box, which did not disappoint.  I would also consider this place $$, not $, because if you get anything more than a burger and a shared side (and you'll need to if you're remotely hungry), you're easily into the $11+ per person range."}
{"text":"One word...Amazing! Try the Brulee burger... You're welcome :) it's a small place but makes up for in flavor. Even the seasoned fries are delicious. By far in my top 3!"}
{"text":"Local burger place that is off the charts!  Creative, juicy burgers that is delicious.  They can accommodate meat eaters and ... Get this vegetarians!  And their sweet potato tater-tots....mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Had the Cinco Diablo, exceeded my expectations GREATLY! Sooo delicious, can't wait to try it again!!"}
{"text":"I eat at burger places all over and this one is definitely up there.  Great burger and fries, with a few specials I'll be back to try.  The fries were tasty with their own seasonings.  Nice setting, good service, def worth checking out.  Ill be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Love this little hole in the wall burger joint. Unique burger creations with yummy fries and milk shakes that time warp you back to your childhood such as their ever so popular lucky charms milkshake. However the portions are small and pricey and I always leave hungry wishing I got another burger but I don't want to leave having spent $30 on food that I eat with plastic ware."}
{"text":"The short version: Not bad, not great. A few problems, nothing major. The food was good... not great, but good.  The long version: A friend and I met up here for lunch yesterday. Even though it was noon, the service was quick. Unfortunately, the floor was had been mopped with something that left a slick residue, and my friend (who was wearing flip flops) had to quickly find a seat so as not to fall. I, however, was wearing boots with heavy tread, so I had no problem. Our food arrived about 10 minutes after we sat down, and it was fresh and enjoyable, though it didn't stand out from other burgers I've had at places like 5 Guys. (I had the Paradise Valley Cheese Burger). The table was wobbly, and it was annoying enough to make me want to change places, but we were engrossed in conversation, so I decided to try to ignore it. The server did come around once to clear away trash and ask if we needed anything, and I wasn't expecting extra attention in a casual burger joint, so that was nice. However, when we left the restaurant at 1:30, the trash can that had been filled to overflowing during the lunch rush had not yet been emptied. That would have been gross enough on its own, but someone had spilled guacamole all over the opening of the trash can, down the side, and onto the floor in front of the can. This was the kind of trash can that you have to push open the flap on the front in order to dump your garbage inside, so it was rather disgusting to have to deal with that.   For the two of us, lunch was about $22. That got us one burger, one side, and an ice water each.  So, overall, it was a pretty decent place to grab a quick, freshly-made hot meal. Just don't expect too much."}
{"text":"This was a welcome surprise. In a dive strip mall, next to a liquor store we found the best burgers on this side of town. Very unique and delicious!"}
{"text":"I am a vegan...with a Paradise Valley Burger Co. addiction!  The bacon cheese burger is the best bacon cheese burger I have ever had. The brioche bun melts in your mouth, as you bite into two perfectly cooked burger patties, topped with cheese, the real deal special sauce, bacon and fresh veggies. I will never have a burger from anywhere else. Don't even get me started on the sugary spicy specialness of their French Fries! Once you go PVBC... You won't want a burger from anywhere else."}
{"text":"Heard about this place on DDD, and was super surprised when I realized that this place was located right across the street from where I used to go to high school.  One of my best friends and I came here on a Saturday to see what all the hype was about, and now I can totally see why.  The owner was super friendly and all of his staff provided great service.  They were so genuine towards their customers, and I appreciated how hard they worked to make everybody happy.  Even though they were super busy, there was enough room for everyone to sit down and enjoy their food.  The bacon cheeseburger my friend and I both had was beyond awesome.  Everything they put on it- from the sauce, the onions, etc.- added its own individual taste to the burger, and it all fit together perfectly.  The sweet potato tots I tried were great as well.  The Lucky Charms shakes that we both had afterward topped off an amazing lunch.  I bragged about how good it was so much that later on, I convinced my mom to pick it for dinner after Saturday mass, and my entire family could see why I went on about it so much and why I wanted to eat it again even after having it for lunch just a few hours earlier.  A big two thumbs up for me!"}
{"text":"I passed by here a few times glad I finally stopped in excellent food better than those chain burger places this is why I go to non chain restaurant better quality better food. If you're in the area stop in definitely worth it"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  The brûlée burger is absolutely amazing.  Explosion of flavors as you bite into this burger.  I love this place and consider myself somewhat of a burger connoisseur.  My only complaint is the prices, very very pricey.  It was $9 for just the burger no drink or sides.  Great food though."}
{"text":"The Brûlée Burger, their signature burger, is ridiculously delicious.  Although I can only eat half of it, I really love the leftover the next day for lunch.  My husband branched out and tried the bacon cheeseburger last night and said it was great.  I just can't get past the Brûlée Burger!  Very friendly staff, guests come from all walks of life.  It is a place where people can get incredible food for a reasonable price.    This place seems to focus on the food and staying on mission.  Prepare for down low dining!  Yummy.  And eventually, I will go in for just a milkshake.  The featured Cannoli shake the other night looked incredible:  vanilla shake, ricotta cheese, fudge, served with a cannoli shell on top.  OMG.  I almost asked a guy who ordered it for a taste!  You order at the cashier and they will bring the food to your table.  P.S.  Even though I described the ambience as \"Casual\" and \"Divey\", please do not change a thing.  It works."}
{"text":"Burger quality is top-notch!  The $5 paradise valley burger, by itself, is scrumptious!  As the simplest item on the menu, it is a tasty meal in itself. Good selection on menu, as well.  Simple hole in the wall place. Only gripe is the cheap, tissue thin, non-absorbent napkins."}
{"text":"We found this little gem on yelp, the food was great! No frills as far as the setting but they serve yummy quality food. We ordered four different burgers and they were all excellent. The owner was super friendly, we plan on going again soon. We drove from East Mesa and we did not regret the ride."}
{"text":"We found this place here on yelp and couldn't be happier with this great little restaurant. The location is nothing fancy and easy to miss from the road, but the food was fantastic. We ordered a beach house burger and a brûlée burger and both were flavorful, unique, and delicious! After hearing about their Facebook page and the specials they post, we checked it out and their specials sound amazing! They are really creative with their burgers and come up with combinations that you would only expect to find at a gourmet burger spot. The fries and sweet potato tots are also better than the price.   Overall, really fun food options, relaxed atmosphere, and good prices. The staff is really friendly and we will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"They have both meat and vegetarian options sandwiches.  HuGE lines and long waits and a little pricey but it can be worth it."}
{"text":"Food was good. We're ordered cheeseburgers, fries, sweet taters and carnival corn. It was all good, but didn't think it was amazing.  The shopping center it's in is a bit sketchy."}
{"text":"The wife and i were trying to decide where and what to eat for lunch when we decided on this burger place.  We were very happy at we tried it.  I had the  country steak sandwich with sweet potato tots.  The wife had bacon cheese burger with fries.  We event treated ourselves to shakes.  I had peanut butter and she had the Lucky Charms shake. Absolutely worth trying! If you want a choice of unique burgers and delicious shakes-try this place!"}
{"text":"Salted caramel pretzel shake changed my life. I got the BBQ burger and it was glorious!!!!!! So stoked to go back"}
{"text":"I went here with my family before Diners, Drive-ins and Dives paid a visit.  Burgers were not too bad, I liked the pickled red onions.  There is nothing special about the location or the inside of this restaurant.  Also, maybe we hit them on a bad day, but we were the only customer their, and I know their burgers are made to order, but it took at least 20 minutes before we got our meal.  I noticed one employee in the restaurant"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service.  I've recommended ths place to everyone in town.  I've tried the tacos and several burgers, and all were declicious.  The sweet potato tots were so good, I got two orders.  Definitely a place to try."}
{"text":"The Brûlée Burger #nuffsaid. But seriously this place has the best burgers in Arizona. Humble presentation and location but do NOT let it fool you. I constantly recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"This place lives up to its reputation. Delicious burgers and tater tot fries are no joke. You won't be disappointed if you give this place a try."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. Surpassed our expectations. Get a milkshake.  Super friendly staff. The paradise burger and booZe burger were bomb!"}
{"text":"The best Juicy burgers!!! In town.   It is a small place with big heart! When you try the burgers they are tasty with sauce and juicy!   Pretty cheap for that quality."}
{"text":"Sorry, but the burgers are not good. My friend liked the brûlée burger okay, but I am looking for a great meat flavor because I can't have sugar, and this didn't even come close.  The meat almost tasted like it was bad. The fried egg was so so. Maybe I caught them on a bad day. I read about this pace in Boots n Burgers and saw it on Food Network, so I took a friend who was visiting PV from Cincinnati. I did't mind that it is sort of a dive and the service was fine."}
{"text":"Four words...I don't get it! Okay, shoot me it's technically five words but how in the world does this place have a 4.5 star average.  And I feel bad for the two star because I like rooting for the small businesses of the world, this just doesn't deserve the stars it does have.  It's a little strip mall dive, which I'm good with and can add to the experience.  It didn't.  The dive was dirty and the \"dude\" behind the counter with the beard gave some of the most lackluster service I've had in a while.  Couldn't hear him, didn't help or suggest anything.  The big miss though was the food.  $7 for an a la carte specialty burger.  Doesn't sound horrible, but it was horribly overpriced when I realized $7 was for a burger barely larger than a slider.  The menu states it is over 1/4 lb, but I doubt it was even a 1/4 lb.  I can get a full 1/2 lb burger at most places in town with a side between $8-$10.  With fries and a drink I was at $12 for a lil burger in a dive?  Part of a cool dive or diner is the value, either the massive portion or the low price as it typically doesn't have the ridiculous overhead of a Houstons or even a Zinburger.  This had neither.  Now for the real bummer, it was supposed to be a Southern Fried burger with gravy & onion strings.  I can't believe I forgot to take a picture of this disappointment but it had almost no gravy and what it did have was like a white flavorless paste.  Sadly in spite of everyone else's rave reviews that led this place to pop up on my radar I will not likely be heading there again.  Closer to 1.5 stars."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend a visit; get the daily special!  They been there a number of years and they have a great burger. Its a quaint little shop with a fun, upbeat group of employees/owners. The owners are totally laid back and recognize all of their regulars. Its a great atmosphere every time I'm there.   They have a really tasty pretzel bun and their pickled zucchini topping brings an awesome bite to the burgers.  Totally worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Thank you yelpers for recommending this place!  Had a cheeseburger with Havarti and corn on the cob. I said \"yum!\" After every bite!  Perfect sized burger, especially the meat to bun ratio!  It was just as satisfying watching other newbies having their first bites!  The employees were also super nice and proud of their product!"}
{"text":"The food to me wasn't that good. Maybe a glorified McDonalds.  If you want weird combinations, this might be your place.  It wasn't mine"}
{"text":"The Brulee burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had. Here on business from CA. The seasoned fries had a hint of salt and sweet. Will come back every time when in AZ."}
{"text":"One of the best values in the valley with unique burgers (always check the burger of the day board before ordering) and consistent quality.  We live nearby and this is always one of favorite regular spots.  The brulee burger is also one of our favorites.  Most recently I had the Booze Burger which has a nice spicy kick.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Best burgers ever! We were in town and saw that this place had great reviews, so decided to try it out. I don't even like burgers, but I was so incredibly surprised by how absolutely delicious my first bite (brulee burger) was even down to the last bite! I didn't know that burgers could taste this good. Throughout the meal, my husband, myself, and our 10 year-old daughter just kept raving about how great it tasted. The young employees were friendly and kind as well. Simply put - great, casual atmosphere combined with good prices for gourmet food in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Wow! Best burger I've had at a baseball game hands down!  This is the second location of Paradise Valley Burger Co. and even though I think the management is different the food is still really really good!  I would have liked to try one of the specialty burgers at the original location,  but I guess they don't offer those here.  Still, a really great burger for whenever I am in the park, and the original is only 15 minutes from my house for whenever I want one of those killer weekly specials."}
{"text":"I had the Bacon Cheeseburger with seasoned fries.  Mixed results.  The patty was a little on the small side and I felt that the pickled red onion and cucumbers were a little bit too dominant.  The cheese was nicely melted and the dressing wasn't too overpowering.  I liked that the bun was buttered and toasted, but it was a bit too thin and subsequently fell apart about halfway through the burger.  The seasoned fries were good, but were so heavily seasoned I could only make it through half the serving.  They have a good concept here and many cool specialty burgers, but there are just a few tweaks needed to make it really good."}
{"text":"I've have tried Paradise Burger a couple time now. With 4-1/2 stars it must be great. Their employees, friend, and family members must be the only people reviewing this dive. I will never go back again. The fries are even bad. SORRY"}
{"text":"A nice place to have a fresh grill taste burger.   It took my back to when I was a kid and you can taste the grill in a nice way.   My boyfriend had the Pork on and he said t was good just cold when he got it.   Cardinals fries were delicious very tasteful. Their Cilantro was FRESH. Loved that.   Sweet potato fries were also a hit. A little sweet but that's the point."}
{"text":"PVBC is a dive. And that's a compliment! With great food, creative menu choices, and friendly staff. Really creative menu choices. I had the Diablo Burger, which is really good if you like food that makes you sweat a little bit. As others mentioned, the sweet potato tots are terrific. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a whim with some friends while I was in town. Never heard of the place before, but saw really good reviews on Yelp. Got the Burger Brulee and the fries--one of the best burgers I've ever had with some really great flavors. The fries were also pretty tasty. I would definitely come back. Recommendation: get a lot of napkins!"}
{"text":"Outstanding ..... From San Diego and needed a burger fix and boy did I get it... Had the beach house recommended by the guy at the counter and he was right on. I will be back next time I'm in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Their burgers are the best!  They have some yummy sauces and the staff is really cool too!  I recommend that you give them a shot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found this place.  Good quality ingredients.  I can't eat wheat and they didn't complain when I asked a lot of questions and ordered a burger without a bun.  I will be back again with my family.  This is a place to check out if gluten free."}
{"text":"Sooooo good. The burgers are just heaven. Staff is super nice. Now here's a little something I didn't see coming: Grilled Portobello Mushroom in place of the burger. Sounds crazy, right?  It isn't. It's to die for. Perfect place to go for a burger along with your vegetarian friend/relative. My daughter is a huge fan of their Carnival Corn and I love their sweet potato tater tots. My husband and son LOVE the pulled pork with their shake. You will not be sorry to visit this local burger joint. It's high end burgers with local flavor and friendly staff."}
{"text":"So I've heard  so many good things about PV Burger and today I decided to go try it out.  MAN was I happy to try it out,  I had an amazing burger called Burger Brulee and my vegetarian wife had a Pulled Vegetarian  which was made with smoked cabbage. The staff was super nice and you just feel at home at this local Burger joint. 5 Stars,  definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers. Small establsihement but the quality of the burgers makes up for it. Highly recommend the place!"}
{"text":"PV burger company was awesome! Great food, great staff and overall a great experience. Been back twice and have tried the burger brulee and the vera cruz tacos which were both amazing! Definitely will be making a trip back soon!"}
{"text":"Frys waaaay over seasoned with not so good seasoning salt, otherwise would probably be delicious.  I really wanted to like them, but meh... Didn't realize I needed to request plain but that's what I'll do next time. Hold the Hershey's chocolate syrup in the shake.  Yuk.  Burger was ok...not convinced they're making patties fresh, tasted frozen.  Bun was great, toppings yummy.  Better than fast food as my husband said, but by no means 5 star.   Overall with a little effort into improving the ambiance and some little tweaks to the food it could be really good.  Just wasn't ths time."}
{"text":"We had the best burgers ever today. Mine was the Beach Burger with green chilis and my boyfriend had the signature Brûlée, a beef burger with bacon, cheese and a fried egg. Outstanding and excellent service. They're also opening a pizza place three doors down. Wish I lived here. It's bound to be awesome!!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to get great food and the staff is almost like family they are so friendly.  Great eats ... A must try sweet potato tater tots. Also the best pizza on earth a few doors down by same people. I even ate the crust."}
{"text":"Just amazing! I loved it. Walked in and asked to surprise me with a burger. I certainly was not disappointed! The Texas BBQ burger came through. It had ingredients that I never thought I'd put on a burger and I enjoyed every bite. Obviously, this place is meant for the adventurous palate. I certainly will come back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried PVBC on impulse looking for a good/different burger place. I loved everything about this place! The atmosphere was chill, the burger brulee was amazing! My only complaint is the sugar on the fries, they were still good but the sweetness was a tad off putting. We will definetly return!"}
{"text":"Pickled Onions.....WOW!!!! If you're craving a delicious burger and you want it now you have got to go to Paradise Valley Burger Company.  I ordered the Burger Brulee and it did not disappoint.  The pickled onions were amazing with the egg, bacon, toasted bun, & seasoned burger.  I've had plenty of burgers with egg and they all start to taste similar, this one DID NOT!  My father-n-law had the Paradise Bacon CHZ and he really enjoyed it, so much so that he wanted to come back the next day just to make sure if was actually that good....lol.  Service is good, burger is better, and they are quick. Must try if you're pressed for time and want a delicious burger or if you just want a good bite."}
{"text":"Really surprised at the awesome variety and culinary acumen they bring to \"just burgers\".  A real treat! Highly recommend their beach house burger and pulled veggie sandwich. Also love the homemade chips!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal burgers, great shakes, and good fries. Decent tacos. Location gets packed, thus, service gets a bit bogged down at times."}
{"text":"Would probably try to get the owner to fall in love with me so he'd marry me and i could eat like a queen for the rest of my days. Hands down best burger in AZ"}
{"text":"Wow! I am not a burger guy but this was an amazing experience. The best restaurants take the normal staples and bring new flavors and ideas into their interpretation. We brought our 5 kids and everyone not only loved what they ordered but then decided what they are going to have when we come back. Well done PVBC!!!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. I love how they always have a special burger or menu! The last time we ate here was over Halloween and we tried one of their specials along with the special Lucky Charms shake and it was amazing!!! We will always come back here and recommend this place to everyone!! **Also the pizza place next door too!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty....but I hope people realize the food is frozen.  We had some pretty good burgers.  The sides are all frozen item.  But the ambiance is gross.  The lights that hang down are out of place.  While the servers don't really clean the tables.  I would suggest never eating in their establishment and would be better off getting food to go.  And maybe getting fried sides from a fast food establishment instead.  It's also odd how you have to ask the register clerk for refills.  But again they do have some tasty toppings for their burgers.  Ehhh.....haven't been back in over a year."}
{"text":"I had the Beach Burger today and my husband had the Parmaseanna Burger. Best burgers we've ever had for $7.00. They were seriously yummy!   We also tried the french toast fries... more like a dessert than like fries. Still really interesting and tasty, but I'd only recommend them for someone who has a serious sweet tooth."}
{"text":"This place was a nice surprise!! Hidden in plain sight, this place services some pretty amazing burgers!! Small on the inside but has character. Once you have eaten, before you leave, you MUST try a shake!!!"}
{"text":"The burgers were amazing! Had the brulee while my husband had the weekly special. After my burger, the seasoned fries, and the maple pecan bacon shake, I was a happy girl. Would definitely go back again!!"}
{"text":"If you haven't gone here, stop what you're doing and GO NOW! Lots of items on the menu but I can't get past the paradise burger- pickled red onion on top and perfect size. Get the slightly sweet fries but be sure to grab from the fridge their custom ketchup and also the garlic sauce for dipping - killer! Very cool crew and they care, it shows."}
{"text":"Enjoyable experience.  Great food, great service and efficient line management.  We received a menu while waiting in line.  As this is not fast food, the wait to recive our food after ordering was not long on a busy Thursday at 1:00 pm. Well done. Will come again"}
{"text":"the country fried burger was absolutely amazing!  i love the cool varieties of differnt types of fries. and the bun! wow.  i went to work out after.. it was definetely worth the calories! next time i am going to try the chix parm burger. check it out. cool little, friendly place"}
{"text":"The burgers are super creative and delicious. They have a rotating special burger, so there's always the opportunity to try something new when you visit. The French Toast Fries are to die for, and their shakes are great as well. My only complaint is that, depending on the burger, it can be a little on the dry side. Still tasty though, and way better than most alternatives."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch , burgers are wonderful. Not great big humongous burgers, perfect size, plus both types of fries delicious.  I am sure had lots of visits after being on TV."}
{"text":"We were close by and found this burger place. Really was surprised how great these burgers were. We ordered two paradise burgers - they have a grilled brioche bun, pickled onions and cucumbers. Excellent!! And it only cost $11 and some change for two!!"}
{"text":"The place was a bit hard to find, but we really enjoyed our time here. We took the reviews of TripAdvisor and Yelp to choose this place and despite its divey kind of appearance, it was a really pleasant experience!  The atmosphere does leave you a bit wanting, but it is clean(ish) and honestly, I think the food warrants a bit of leeway here. You order off the menu at the bar and from the reviews and our experience, you get a bit of a variety of help. We found them to be a bit obnoxious, but not in a bad or offending way. I think they like their regulars that know what they want and how to order, so us tourists were a bit awkward.  We had the Booze burger, Country Fried burger and the Sweet potato tots & French toast fries. Both burgers were excellent and good portion sizes. The french toast fries are a bit weird, but very good.  Don't let the appearance talk you out of going here. I highly recommend it for a great burger and quirky experience."}
{"text":"This is a burger TOPPING place more than anything... Not complaining!  Super divey in a shady strip mall next to a liquor store.  The burger patties are super skinny and nothing special.  The bun, toppings, sauces, and sides are outstanding!    I've tried several specials here including the Cockeyed cowboy which featured pulled pork & more.  The best thing here are the French toast fries!"}
{"text":"Solid burgers. Creative combinations. Friendly staff, casual environment.  According to my dining companions, the tacos were also very good!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Speedy too. Food was mouthwatering perfection. The inside is small so if your planning on eating in get there before you're starving."}
{"text":"I love it here. I love the booze burger. The only thing I would do differently is omit the seasoning from the fries. The seasoning made them almost inedible in my opinion, way too salty. Next time I'm going for the fries plain. I think I may have to eat my way through the menu here!"}
{"text":"This was a nice treat to find in this area. As an out of towner it was really nice to find a non-chain restaurant.  I have to say this is one of the best burgers i have ever had. And what makes it is the pickled red onion and the mix of cheese i got on the bacon cheeseburger. We also got the sweet potato tots and they were delicious. Owner is a super nice guy as well!  Go here you wont regret it."}
{"text":"Seasoned French Fries are bombie dot comie. Casual dive burger joint tucked into a corner shopping center. Would recommend to a friend. Or to a couple on like their third date."}
{"text":"Love this place!     I'm always tempted by the weekly special burger.  Sometimes they are so tempting I have to order two burgers:  one special and the brûlée burger.  Try to French toast fries, too.   They are just as tasty as you would imagine them to be.    My husband tried the tacos are they were pretty good too - but only go that route if you really aren't feeling a burger.     Only complaint is that it sometimes feels dirty inside.   Not really in health hazard way, but more in a \"please clean your table tops after messy guests don't bother to clean after themselves\" kind of way.   I don't like having to throw away other patrons' trash."}
{"text":"A fast casual burger/sandwich/salad place.  Burgers were good - similar to The Hamburger Works at 15th Ave and Thomas - however the toppings were all their own.  And delicious!  Our cheeseburgers came with pickled red onion, cucumbers, lettuce, and a choice of 1,000 island or ranch dressing.  The toppings combo really worked.  They have other even more creative topping combos as well.  We also had the sweet potato tater tots - excellent.  The decor is pleasant, the seating is comfortable, and the service was really friendly.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"SO happy to find this little gem hiding in my own back yard. I tell all my friends and family about this place - I mean it would be unfair to keep it to myself. Words do not do this place justice, you really just have to taste the juicy goodness yourself. Staff are always friendly and inviting. Nothing short of absolutely phenomenal! If you haven't eaten here you are definitely missing out."}
{"text":"This was a great experience. The burgers were absolutely yummy and the cardinal fries were spicy and yummy. The two young ladies were very very kind and treated our kids really well. It's a little expensive and the shakes, while good, we're not as great as it's been hyped up to me. The Lucky Charms shake is basically vanilla with cereal mixed in. It's good - but I've read reviews that it's the best shake in Phoenix and I can't agree with that. Still, we will be back. You won't likely be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food but terrible service. 2nd time here and 2nd time they lost my order. Waited 35 min for a burger and fries!  Not a quick place to grab a burger. Don't think I'll try this place again with so many other great burger places out there with MUCH better service!"}
{"text":"I had the Booze Burger after seeing it on the show. It wasn't on the normal menu, but you can still ask for it. The idea of the burger is quite interesting. It was good, but not sensational. The Sweet Potato Tater Tots were good with the Chipotle Ketchup. I'd go back, but I'd try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Traveled from Texas to find a little bit of Paradise at Paradise Valley Burger. Had a very juicy Beach Burger loaded down with flavor. My daughter stepped out and explored the Brulee' Burger. For one who is not prone to hyperbole, she proclaimed it the best burger of her sixteen years on earth. Tasty seasoned fries to top it off.  Took some time but that seems to be the standard here in Phoenix. It's okay. I'm on vacation."}
{"text":"Today I am having the booze burger and sweet potato tater tot's service is excellent I will be back to try another burger probably the paradise burger"}
{"text":"I went in to this place really wanting to love it!! But then we waited TWENTY FIVE minutes for a burger and a couple sides. Which is especially annoying when you have kids and the staff is totally apathetic and acts like it's normal to wait that long. And when the food came out, it wasn't even hot.  The burger had hardly any slaw or sauce on it and after paying $5.50 for the lucky charms shake, we were hoping it would be something special but no, it was basically a vanilla shake with whipped cream and a couple marshmallows on top. The sweet potato tots were the best thing there but their ranch sauce was weirdly thick and didn't have hardly any flavor. So I don't think we will be back and we're disappointed."}
{"text":"The best around. Great flavors and fun combinations. Make it your weekly stop for the burger special and shake special."}
{"text":"Looked so good, I did'nt want to eat it. But it tatsed great. Need to do something with the decor."}
{"text":"If this place was in my neighborhood, I'm certain I'd be on a first-name basis with the staff.  They would know my \"usual\" order; one burger brulee, hold the bacon, seasoned fries and a pepsi.  I'd make a clever joke about the Burger of the Week and my husband would fist bump the guy behind the counter... ok I might be getting carried away.  But when we first walked into the little shop, we were greeted like we were old friends and given some quick, concise tips on navigating the menu and ordering process.    They easily accommodated our large group, and our rambunctious cheering-on of Jennifer O's live review.  Then the food arrived.  Although the majority of us got the Brulee burger, or some variation thereof, a good portion of the menu was represented on our table.  We got to try the french toast fries and bacon and maple shake.  We learned that PV Burger does burgers \"protein style\" upon request, and won't hesitate to use the term coined by that other burger joint.  And I learned that I LOVE pickled onions, especially on top of a fried egg and underneath burnt sugar.  Don't be afraid of burnt sugar on your burger, you threw the diet out the window today anyway.  I think there may be sugar in the french fry seasoning, too.  I really loved my burger.  The patty was more well-done than I usually prefer but it never got chewy or crumbly or any of those other things one worries about with an overdone burger.  It was still flavorful and delicious.  All the toppings worked together in a medley I never would have dreamed, and didn't realize I was missing.  I don't think I've ever finished an entire restaurant-sized burger before in one sitting, but I did that and have no regrets.  If I were to complain about anything, it would be these two points: One table was sticky enough that a menu was a permanent fixture of that particular table, and the cleanliness of the girl's room left something to be desired.  That said, those things wouldn't deter me for a second if I had the chance to come back here for another burger."}
{"text":"Took the kids and my mom. There was something for everyone and we all left happy. My son actually ordered an additional burger to go and he is extremely picky. From the outside, you may question whether to go in but Go in! We ordered: cheese burger, hamburger, pulled veggie sandwich, French toast fries, carnival corn, fried brussel sprouts and the beach house burger. The burgers were well seasoned and not too greasy. The bun was soft and slightly sweet. A burger comes with 2 patties for a total quarter pound. Would definitely go back for good food!"}
{"text":"We love this place!! Burger options are always changing and always delicious!!  Dining room is tiny and hard for large groups but staff are always fun and helpful!!"}
{"text":"Great Burger.  Love the cucumber slices on the bacon cheese burger.  They are a great add to the burger.  Can't wait to try others.  Fries were fantastic.  Love the little touch of sugar for a sweet/salty taste on the fries as well.  Sort of like \"Kettle Fries\"."}
{"text":"Searched in Yelp for a good restaurant around me and came across this place. It's a small little place in a strip mall. I had the paradise bacon cheeseburger and french fries. The burger comes on a brioche bun that's grilled. They have 1000 Island dressing they make themselves with a flavorful taste that's not your usual 1000 island. This burger was absolutely delicious! Even though I was full I had to finish the whole thing.  The customer service was top-notch. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Legitimate question: Why is this place rated so high? If you have an answer, I'd love to know because maybe my experience was a fluke. I was so excited to visit this restaurant since it's only 5 minutes from my house and I've heard nothing but great things from everyone I know about this place, but I didn't have that experience.   The restaurant itself has a terrible aesthetic. I came in thinking it's because they focus on their food over the location and décor and I'd prefer it that way, but since I didn't like the food it just added to my dislike. I ordered the Burger Brulee which sounded great, but I don't like yolk dripping everywhere because it is so messy and I end up having to wash my face after eating a burger with it so I asked if they could scramble the eggs. They couldn't so I asked them to over cook the egg. They said they couldn't do that either... I don't feel like arguing about it with them, I'm already here, the burger sounds good, and I'm not wear makeup so I decide that I'll just wash my face in the bathroom when I finish and I completed my order with the french toast fries.   When I got my food, the fries were cold and the burger wasn't straight. Meaning the burger was all over the place and it looked like someone threw the ingredients in the basket in order, but from a couple feet away with no regard for presentation of the food or the mess it was going to make. After I put my burger together and made a mess of myself the food was ok, but it felt like I was eating leftovers that just aren't as good as they were the day before when the meal was fresh.  I'm so disappointed in this place. It had all the right options on the menu and it had the credibility not only on social media, but also from my friends and colleagues so I was terribly let down when I didn't get to have the experience I was told I would."}
{"text":"Pretty decent burger joint. Like most people, we decided to stop by after we watched an episode of Triple D from Food Network. The Bacon and Cheese Burger was pretty darn tasty. I'm not a fan of pickles but even my boyfriend wasn't a fan of the pickled onions. Some people seem to LOVE it though.   I would've opted for the sweet potato tots over the fries if I had known they add sugar to the seasoning. Might as well have sweet potato fries on the menu if you're gong to add sugar to the regular french fries. Or maybe have homemade spicy ketchup.. mmmm  The staff was friendly and service was pretty fast even though the place is jam packed. (Thanks Food Network)"}
{"text":"Just get the special no matter what. You will NOT be disappointed. Their carnival corn is unbelievably good as well. Awesome local place that you should not hesitate to support!!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my dish only, the Booze Burger. It was completely tasteless!  Is that even possible?  The \"gravy\", the burger, the bun which was coated in some kind of grease. The \"smoked Fresno chiles\" were raw chiles.  I'm not a salt person but I think that's the only think that would have saved this burger.  Try something else. I would have reordered by a party of 7+ kids and ~6 adults came in. On a good note, the grilled cheese sandwich was good."}
{"text":"Okay this is a great burger spot and close to home. WE will be back! I just wished they served big ole steak fries, although then I would never leave."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Food is amazing!! They also have homemade chips that are so yummy!!"}
{"text":"The wife and I went and loved it.  One of the best burgers in Phoenix.  We went around 1:30 and wasn't very crowded, which was great.  It's a small place and I'm sure it gets packed during lunch and dinner hours.  Next time we will try the sweet potato tots.   Milkshakes are great too!  Thanks for making an awesome burger at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had. If it was a little closer, I might go every week lol. The burnt sugar buns are amazzzing. I also tried out the French toast fries which were so good. It's posted in a small strip mall and you would easily miss it driving by so keep that in mind. Love itttt"}
{"text":"I dig this place for sure. Obviously it's getting a lot of hype because of Guy Fieri or however you spell his name. But I can say I absolutely loved my burger and fries."}
{"text":"Questo ristorante è un posto dove si può mangiare bene. Gli hamburger sono quasi perfetti, ma io sto cercando ancora per il meglio burger del mondo. Nonostante questo, Paradise Valley Burger Co. è veramente uno dei migliori ristoranti da mangiare un hamburger in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Came to check out place after seeing reviews,  owner claims to have best burger in town,  order several burgers in different variation, unfortinatly have to get them as take out order and by the time I was able to tray them they was cold but remain testy, really need to comeback and retry them"}
{"text":"Really, really great tasting burger. I wanted to try a burger in their standard menu so I ordered the Beach Burger.  I was tempted to substitute Cheddar for the Smoked Mozzarella since I tend not to like \"smoked\" cheeses, but I followed the Yelpers before me and put my faith in the good guys at PVB and their awesome combinations. Turned out to be such a good flavor combo, it might make me re-think my attitude towards \"smoked\" cheese! But what really made me want to return and try another PVB combo was the bun. Buns can make or break a burger IMHO.  This bun was light, soft and just big enough to serve its role as burger holder.  Superb!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting from LA and found this wonderful hole in the wall. The girl who took our order was really peppy and helpful. There was a poster with the autograph of Guy Fieri, who had come by to do his tv show, \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives\" there. We each ordered a regular burger with raw onions and fries. The burger consisted of 2 patties, and it was juicy and messy. It was like a party started in our mouths!! What great flavor!!!! Probably 40% fat!! The seasoning for the fries was reminiscent of bbq potato chips. They were just out of the fryer, so they were very hot!!! Also delicious!!! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"You have to try the chicken club. Awesome sandwich. Different than any other. My new favorite sandwich here."}
{"text":"I live literally 3 minutes away from this place and it's one of my go to stops for a great burger. Since they were on diners, drive in and dives, this place has gotten a lot busier. The customer service is still outstanding and the burgers are awesome.  I am a fan of this place and I recommend you try one of their speciality burgers.  They also have outstanding milk shakes. This place is also next to my favorite pizza joint, Isa's, so if you are looking for a slice of pizza, stop by there for some good pizza."}
{"text":"Simply put, these guys set the standard by which all burgers should be judged.   Incredibly tasty!"}
{"text":"This place is legit! Definitely a hole in the wall kind of place but the burgers are oh so good! I got the brûlée burger and it was the bomb! Everything on the burger worked so well together. Points get deducted because the sweet potato tots just weren't very crispy and not exactly how I like my tots. I would like to head back and try more of their awesome burgers!"}
{"text":"Best burgers ever! Their specialty burgers are amazing! A different burger and milk shake/malt every week!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My fiance had the country fried burger and I had the burger burlee, they were both the most incredible burgers ever! The sweet potato tater tots with the house made spicy ranch is delicious. I will be coming back here often since the price is so affordable for how yummy it is! It's just the right amount of food. The one guy I met behind the counter was very nice and courteous as well!! :) can't wait to try something new next time."}
{"text":"The food is great and the service is right on par. You can tell that the owner actually cares about taste and presentation and that is probably why they were featured on triple d. Congrats"}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight after driving past it for 3 years now!!! Should have tried it waaaaaay sooner!!! Everything was excellent! My fiancé tried the beer battered burger, there is a reason it was featured on Triple D's. Even my cheddar burger was awesome for the less adventurous!! Love cucumbers on my food, nice touch to my burger!! Place is kid friendly too, also a plus for us! Food came out super quick, hot and delicious! Thanks for a great dinner!!"}
{"text":"This place is INCREDIBLE!!! Easily one of the best burgers I've ever enjoyed. I'm still speechless."}
{"text":"I freakin' love this place! I've tried just about everything: Most of the burgers, several of the specials, the pulled pork, and tacos. Everything is awesome! Whoever the house chef is deserves to be recognized for his unique and delicious combinations. Just go here."}
{"text":"I love a really good grilled burger and PV Burger Co. did not disappoint! I am in love with this place and will continue to go back for my \"fix\"! I wasn't a huge fan of what they put on the burgers, (Thousand Island dressing, pickled onions, just to name a few) but I was able to have them add/take off whatever I wanted. Another plus, they have harvarti cheese, cheddar and smoked swiss (nice options for cheese). The french fries were real good too. And everything is nice and hot, fresh off the grill. I recommend this place to everbody and can't wait to take my mother. She too has been looking for a good burger joint. For the PV Chz burger I ordered (that came with fries) and the diet coke it came up to about $8. Worth every penny!  Now, if only they would deliver!!"}
{"text":"Maple Bacon Milkshake: Nice and salty with bits of crunchy bacon and pecan in every creamy sip.  While the presentation may not be as fancy as Zinburger, the styrofoam cup is convenient to take with you, and keeps the shake nice and cold.  I was very happy that it was not so thick that I needed a spoon, and that it stayed chilled throughout my meal   Brûlée Burger: The burnt sugar crusted bun was amazing.  The bacon and egg were perfectly cooked, and the meat was a nice juicy medium-well bordering on well-done.  I'm usually not a dressing fan but I didn't mind it.  I'll do admit I will probably ask for no lettuce and dressing next time to perfect a carnivore masterpiece.  Like the shake, the texture of the burger was excellent, so whoever is the chef has a great grasp on putting together solid recipes with a good \"mouth feel.\"  The customer service was fantastic.  The guy manning the register was very friendly, and another young male employee checked up on me and offered to take my empty burger basket and trash away.  He was also very quick to clear off and wipe down tables once people had left.  Atmosphere-wise, it's very well put together for a small restaurant, and while crowded, I didn't feel claustrophobic.  I also was very happy they keep their music at a very decent level.  The name-calling for orders wasn't that distracting.  There was also plentiful parking on a Saturday afternoon!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Yum. So good. Our food was fast and delicious. Loved that it was fast bc we had our toddlers. For sure gotta come,back to this side of town again!!!"}
{"text":"What a great burger place, no wonder it was diners and dives. I had the burger brûlée and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Went here again today for probably the third time. Got the buffalo brûlée burger and fries. The burger was absolutely delicious, and so were the fries! The burger was one of their weekly/daily specials. When I have visited previously I've primarily ordered from the regular menu but from now on I will be getting the special! The fries are slightly sweet which was actually really yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm from Vegas and saw this place on tv and had to try it. My wife is on business In Arizona so perfect. This place is small but has a big punch when it comes to the food. Service was great and all the employees was friendly. Her is what we ordered,  Country fried burger- this burger was amazing. Imagine a country fried steak but burger style. Burger was juicy and the flavors was out of his world. The bread is cut in to a square shape so you can get all of the burger. I would come back for this alone.  BooZe burger- this burger is unique. The meat is marinated in vodka and deep fried coated with beer batter. the chili peppers is pickled in whiskey. On the side they give you fuego sauce. Flavors all over the place.   Labor Day fries- what can I say about this. Fries topped with loaded mozzarella cheese with turkey and turkey gravy. Topped with a sunny side egg.   Sweet potato tator tots- this was alright. Nothing special.  Overall a great place to fulfill your burger fantasy. I would recommend this place to anyone that like a good ol American burger."}
{"text":"Best burger place in town! Friendly staff and fantastic food. Big fan of the maple bacon milkshake!"}
{"text":"Lots of great Burgers to try. I had the Brûlée Burger I replaced the onion with onion straws (It was tasty, but something on it made it too sweet for me - not a sweet meat person). I also had the homemade BBQ chips (I was a little disappointed that they were not fresh cooked, but pre-made)."}
{"text":"Have been meaning to go to this place since watching them on D&D.  Walked in and ordered the country fried burger with carnival corn instead of fries.  The food arrived within 5 minutes.  The corn was very good, and the burger was good as well, the place had cool decor with photos of their burgers on the wall, and the staff was very friendly.  I do prefer to taste the beef more, so I typically prefer a larger patty and fewer condiments.  In this case, there was a pile of fried onions, a very thin patty, sauce, and tomatoes and lettuce, I could taste good flavors but not quite the beef.    Overall, I'm a 3.5 so I rounded up since we can't do half points on Yelp."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic burgers! I'm not a meat person, and this place is pretty good...  Everything is fresh, the people are super friendly, and they are always busy.  It's worth the wait in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Two of us were looking for a place to have a quick bite. Nice Job! Orders came out correct and quick compared to the number of folks! Yes, it was busy, but they moved the food!  Fresh and correct! Tasted great!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wow..... now that's a burger!  Ordered the special of the day 2 beef patties, crispy potatoes,  beer braised leeks, bacon & aged cheddar & a gravy   They have some very yummy sounding burgers & shakes.  Yes the place isn't fancy but I'm ok with that...."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great burgers. They put a nice twist on the standard burger by the way they prepare the bun. I had the Burger Brûlée specialty burger and added avocado. It was delicious! However, it was also pretty heavy. The seasoned fries were solid too. I have a few favorites for burgers in the area so far and this one ranks just a hair below them."}
{"text":"It may be a hole in the wall kind of place and I wish they were open later but best burger in Phoenix for sure!"}
{"text":"We don't eat red meat but they substitute chicken for any burger.  We had the Paradise Valley cheese chicken with smoked mozzarella.   It was REALLY delicious."}
{"text":"I live just a few minutes away, and this place had been recommended by Jim from Market Bistro.  Finally got a chance to get in tonight and try it and I will definitely be back!  Best burger I have had in years!  I had the Beach Burger and added Avocado and Bacon,.  My son had the Brulee Burger and we shared some fries.  The burgers were cooked perfectly and the seasoning on the fries was spot-on.  What I really appreciated was the bun.  As you all know, there is nothing worse than a great burger that gets lost in a huge dry bun.  You won't have that problem here with the brioche burger buns.  If you are looking for a great burger, or if you want to support our local small businesses, stop by Paradise Valley Burger Company.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burgers I've had, hands down. Their signature burger is the bomb! The sweetness (sugar on the burger), brings out that entire flavor of the burger. Between that and those sweet potato tater-tots! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I asked for a cheeseburger with bacon combo not being familair with the menu. The overweight guy behind the register was quick to correct me \"oh you mean the paradise bacon cheseburger\". ...he seemed offended. Sounds good I said, with a side of ranch too for the fries. He took my money as if he was doing me a favor by ringing me up.   ...once I got my food, the burger was OK, better than fast food, but not as good as I was hoping from the pictures & reviews. The fries were pretty good, but the 'ranch' was not ranch. I went to the cooler thinking the d-bag at the register mixed it up. I reached for another cup explaining what I had was some sort of potato salad. He looked offended again claiming \"oh no, that's ranch! I made it myself this morning\" ...bottom line; the paradise bacon cheseburger is better than carls jr (but SMALL), they have no idea what ranch is, their sodas are over-priced cans because they can't afford a fountain machine, & their customer service sucks.   F this place & the land-blimp who owns it.  -Mark"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after seeing them featured on Food Network and my hopes were high! That said... The Country Fried Burger was really good. I was expecting more breading from the country fried component of the Burger but it was still really good. The gravy sauce was thin but tasty. I enjoyed it. My wife had the Burger with Marinara... She really liked it. The fries were crisp and tasty. Overall the food was really good.   The atmosphere was a bit lacking. The radio was playing really loudly and made it difficult to chat while eating. The table and chairs inside were decent enough for a burger joint but the outdoor seating was all plastic chairs and blah.   This place is way the heck North of Phoenix off Bell Rd so the real question should be, \"Is it worth the drive?\"  Yes. It is. The decor might be cheap but the food is surprisingly good! Get out to Paradise Valley and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding?? There should be six stars for the food!  I ordered to go and good thing I did. It was 1.30pm and no tables available. That speaks volumes. I had the veggie sandwich best described as shredded veggies with BBQ sauce. Awesome! And the sweet potato tots Great! I highly recommend Paradise Valley Burger!!"}
{"text":"My first time going was Saturday morning. We got there before lunch which was the best time since we quickly realized the seating is limited and boy this place gets freaking packed. It's good food and people are willing to wait for it. If you do come during lunch maybe get it to go in case ya can't find a seat. Or sit on the side walk and enjoy the damn thing already. I ordered the special Margarita burger with avocado, pomegranate seeds and a delicious deep fried jalapeno. Heck yeah it was delicious. I saw this place on tv and I was not disappointed. Local, hole in the wall, great food, people are nice. One tip for customers do not complain about not getting a seat, figure something out and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"The place is kinda dumpy, the tables were sticky but we tried to see past that. I had the PV burger and fries they were very good. My husband has a bacon burger it was a little over cooked for med- rare. My daughters chocolate shake was good but not great for $5. We will try again, but off peak hours."}
{"text":"Incredible as always! Never a disappointment. Saint Patrick brulee special is spot on!"}
{"text":"The name says it all.. it's all about the burgers here! If you are sick and tired of the fast food type chains that bring their frozen burgers with no life and flavor.. then this is the place to be. There are so many different ways to prepare this classic meal and this place has truly mastered the art. Always using the freshest ingredients with the most creative recipes, there is a burger for everyone here. It truly is a paradise for burger lovers from around the world. Most of the reviews will claim that this place truly is too good to be true, or un-real! Don't be put-off by the basic counter and decor, it's what happens in the kitchen that makes it a must-see-destination when in the Phoenix area. When there check out the French Toast Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, Carnival Corn, Burger of the Week, Venetian Burger, Pretzel Fries, Cubano, Beach House Burger, Paradise Burger Chicken Fresno Tacos and wash it all down with the Lucky Charms Shake!"}
{"text":"It's busy and kind of small. I liked the burger but wanted more meat. The sauces are good and unique. Chocolate milkshake and sweet potato tots are where it's at!"}
{"text":"Phew, this is a GREAT place for sure. The reviews are what got me here and no doubt I WILL be back. Had the Beach Burger."}
{"text":"I have had a sandwich and a burger from here. Both with sweet potato tots. I liked the tots. They were crispy and delicious. The first order was for the pulled pork sandwich. The pork was tender and not stringy. BBQ sauce was a nice balance of sweet and salty. Bread was crispy. The next order was a burger, the beach house. Sooooo good! Bread was nice and soft but did not crumble when handled. It was refreshing with the pico and spicy cheese! Meat was a little pinker than I was used to, but juicy and flavorful nonetheless. Price wise, it's not really a bad price. Average about $12 for an order. Still haven't tried a shake yet. Love this place."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. I've only had the tacos here, but they are tasty. I had the beef tacos once and the chicken tacos today. Both very good and the difference styles are very good as well. One of the things I thought were extremely good were the regular fries. For some reason they were some of the best I ever tasted. Not sure if it is the seasoning they put on them or what, but very tasty.   I will definitely recommend, and will visit often."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!! Atmosphere reminded us of a bad ass burger spot in San Diego. Can't believe this place isn't packed, all the time. The food was fantastic- I had the Burger Brulee (great balance of flavor with pickled onions offsetting the sweetness), and my fam both got the Diablo burger (love the spicy!) We also shared Cardinal fries (flavors work so well together, got better with every bite), and jalapeño fries (literally fried slices of peppers- went great with the delicious house jalapeño ranch). Relaxed, locally owned feel and very family friendly, we enjoyed everything and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I love burgers. I order burgers at almost every restaurant I go to... Paradise valley burger has the best burger I've ever tried. Hands down. The brûlée burger (with no onions) is possible God's gift to man. I dream about this burger. Do yourself a favor and take my advice. Brûlée burger is the way to go. The fries have an amazing seasoning on them and I love the sweet potato tots also! And if you're looking for a unique dessert the French toast fries are a deep fried delicacy or the lucky charms milk shake is another good choice."}
{"text":"So good I've been following them on fb and I finally got to try them on this trip I had a beerbattered burger with bacon and vodka sauce and sweet tater tots.. Definitely trying more on their menu when I come back this way.."}
{"text":"This is my fav burger joint.  Nothing fancy but a frickin amazing burger.  Found place after watching DDD.  They were right on with this one"}
{"text":"I got the Brulee burger w/ chicken and no cheese. (Side of sweet potato tots) Omg I inhaled this Burger! It tasted like heaven sooo good! The chocolate malt made a perfect dessert"}
{"text":"We drove about 25 minutes to check this place out because of the good reviews. Burgers were good, but nothing to write home about. Fries had a weird seasoning.   Quaint little place seemed busy enough to look like it was okay to eat at. If it wasn't busy, I'd have never gone in. It's the kind of place where you don't want to check out the restroom because, well, it might ruin your appetite."}
{"text":"I would give 3.5 for the cardinal fries. Tried their st. Patricks Brulee burger and my husband got the beach burger. They were both good, not great, wish they had beer as well. While enjoyable, there are better places in town."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite burger joint in the valley.  They not only have a nice selection of everyday burgers, every week they have a special to keep the regulars happy.  If you are not in the mood for a burger their tacos are incredible, I recommend the beef fresno tacos.  Have yet to try something I haven't liked."}
{"text":"As weird as the burgers can get, I've yet to have one that wasn't incredible. The corn on the cob... the milkshakes... it is all good here and worth every bit of hype."}
{"text":"3 for 3. Delicious every time! Brulee Burger is my FAV! It has a fried egg on it. Also has pickled onions, bacon, Havarti cheese and sugar cooked into the bun. I also have had the country fried burger which was really good too. They make their own spin on the country gravy sauce that has a very nice blend of herbs and spices. The next time I am going to try the Beach House burger that has a roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella and pico de Gallo.   They also make their own bbq potato chips that have a bit of a kick to them. This is a really good burger joint. They have only been open a few months. Please go try them out so they can stay in business. It is a shame that really great places go under just because people do not know about them."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger joint ANYWHERE. I highly recommend this place. Very great flavor. Staff is wonderful. And very reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Scrumptious burgers and sides with specialty toppings and bursting flavors. Just be sure you eat reaaall light before going as this place may help you enjoy a 1,000+ calorie meal! They do have tasty salad and taco options, though, despite epic burger reputation."}
{"text":"How have I lived a mile from here for months and yet today is the first time I've been here?? Paradise Valley Burger Co, while unassuming from the outside, is an absolute gem. No exaggeration, this was the best burger I've had I've had all year. And as a \"recovering vegan\", I'm usually pretty indifferent to burgers.  I had the Burger Brûlée (fried egg, bacon, onion, burnt sugar bun, havarti) with the pulled pork & green chili cheese fries (I believe they were called \"Sonoran Fries\") and it was next level. It was so good that even though I really want to try different things on the menu, I don't know if I'll even be able to order anything else for fear of missing out on the deliciousness of that burger."}
{"text":"My friend told me about this place!  She could not say enough great things about it!  So I stopped in!  The curb appeal  does not match this incredible menu!  I think people may pass it by because of location. But don't!  Fresh ingredients, unique items, and yummy sides!  Burgers with items you never would have dreamed of !"}
{"text":"I don't venture towards the north of Phoenix to often but I was meeting a buddy for lunch. Paradise Valley Burger had been recommended by a friend a while back. It's in a strip mall with very little fan fair, which is perfectly fine by me. I ordered the diablo burger and was crazy good. Fresh veggies and Green chilly , juicy burger ,toasted bread  and last but not least flavor .  The fries are good not great but I was really only there for the burger.  They do have several other different style burgers which means you can experiment. Polite service with a smile."}
{"text":"OMG  THE BEST burgers in North Phoenix.   Makes all the other burger joints TASTE like dog food.   I have eaten at all of them.  The Habit Smash Burger 5 Guys In-and-Out  This place smokes them all!"}
{"text":"Yum!  In the mood for a laid back place with great, fresh food? If so, head into PV Burger Company... that's exactly what I did.  Had the bacon cheeseburger and sweet potato tots with street corn on the side.  The burger was cooked perfectly.  It was juicy and fresh, served with crispy bacon, good sauce, and cucumber slices on top, which I thought was a nice touch.  It took a few minutes to get to me, but the place was busy and I knew my food was being cooked just for me, so I was ok with it.  The street corn was a bit overdone, but the tots were good, and I'm not a huge fan of sweet potato.  I'm looking forward to popping in again soon and trying this brule burger everyone is raving about... yum, yum, yum!"}
{"text":"Brûlée burger is the best burger I have ever had!  The owner Bret is a master craftsmen when it comes to food!  Great people great food!!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. Food is good, not great. I guess if you had it at one location, it's the same every where. Good customer service."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, when my husband pulled into the parking lot of \"this great place he read about on Yelp\", I was extremely skeptical.  It looks like just a little hole in the wall restaurant from the outside. I decided to play it safe and order the Paradise CHZ with smoked mozzarella, my rather picky children both got the kids cheeseburger meal, and my husband ordered the Country Fried burger.  Despite the place being pretty busy, we didn't have to wait very long for our food to be delivered to our table.  They did forgot one of the kids meals however they whipped it up for us in no time at all.    Let me just say, my burger was AMAZING.  I truthfully don't think I've ever had a better burger.  Even my kids who tend to only like macaroni and cheese or chicken fingers love their burgers.  The french fries were delicious too.  Nice and crispy just the way I like.  Not soggy, not burnt; they were cooked perfectly.  The milkshakes...oh the milkshakes.  SO delicious.  None of that fake strawberry syrup junk, real strawberries!  While we did order a chocolate shake as well, I can't tell you if it was as good as the strawberry shake simply because my kids and husband drank it all before I got a taste, lol.  If I could give this place bonus points I would.  Why?  Because they have to-go boxes set out on the counter so you don't even have to ask."}
{"text":"That really was a pretty good burger.  I can honestly I've had better, but if you're hungry for a really good burger, you'll be happy you stopped by."}
{"text":"Their is a reason this place is always busy - simply the best burgers in town. A great variety of food on the menu all cooked to perfection. If you like hamburgers or just great food do yourself a favor and visit this place."}
{"text":"This place is bomb as hell.  We didn't know it was on triple d but apparently it was and Guy always has a great taste in food because the chicken sandwich I got was pretty darn good.  The best part is it's hella cheap.  Everything is pretty much under 10 dollars here ;o"}
{"text":"I loved this little hole in the wall strip mall restaurant.  The place was so unappealing and coming from LA, the strip mall vibe just turns me off.  But I came here because the menu looked so unique.  And it was!!!  I was so impressed by the options and taste level.    I ordered:  grilled cheese with Havarti on whole wheat. - you can never go wrong with Havarti and at 6 dollars I was in heaven.   The Cali burger - was very juicy and the flavor a were good.  The burger was a little too over done, I like my meat to still be mooing, this was brown all the way through.   French toast fries - one of the best things I've ever had. Take the best part of French toast and make a side dish out of it. Perfect.   Lucky charms shake. -  I thought I'd hate it, but one of the best shakes I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Just a heads up...the Musical Instruments Museum is 2 miles away from here...and we stopped in for a quick lunch. Small on the interior, and a picture on the wall from Diner, Drive in's and Dives on the wall.  I got a spicy burger with a whole pablano pepper on it....so yummy! Thinner square burger with square brioche style bun....great fries and tater tots.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Don't let the strip mall deter you since most amazing little gems are usually hidden in strip malls it seems.   I had the Beach House burger which was super favorable. The pico mixed with smoked mozzarella and green chili. Wow.. Had the sweet potato tots and BBQ chips which were both tasty.   Friends ordered the French Toast fries which weren't my thing (don't like French toast in the first place, I know I'm weird) but he was in love.   We will definitely be back as I want to try their tacos and carnival corn."}
{"text":"Great burger! My wife and I truly enjoy getting a regular burger and fries. We've tried the shakes as well and they are really good."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far, and got the Country Fried Burger and sweet tats both times. The quality and taste are top-notch for a burger joint."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great prices! Opted for the bacon cheese burger which was perfectly made! Employees were fun and friendly and can move a lunchtime line. Tacos and clubs looked delicious, will definitely try on my next visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best burgers and fries around in Phoenix I have found! They have the old fashioned hamburgers and it tastes like a hamburger should! like the old fashioned kind. The burgers are juicy and the flavor is great! Tasted so good, we ate there 4 times last week and brought friends with us! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Our office came here again today and had a WOW service moment. We always talk about great customer service and how far it goes!! Well PV Burger took it to another level today. When realizing they left out 1 of our orders, the owner (I'm assuming) ran across 3 lanes of traffic and hand delivered or tacos to our vehicle.  I can't begin to express our gratitude as our office is about 6 miles away and would have been a bummer to have missed 1 of our 8 meals."}
{"text":"After seeing all the rave reviews (and the 4.5 overall rating) for Paradise Valley Burger Company, we were really expecting a lot more. Not sure if they were just having an off day, but we were not at all impressed. The cashier was friendly enough when we walked in and gave us time to look over the menu but offered no suggestions or assistance for questions. I asked her for a recommendation anyway and ended up getting the Burger Brûlée with chicken and a side of seasoned fries. My fiancé got The Texas BBQ with a side of Cardinal Fries.  It didn't take much time for the food to come out and the Burger Brûlée looked really good. Not only was there a caramelized sugar coating on both sides of the bun, but the fried egg was oozing yolk. The burger was sizable and due to how messy it was, I ended up eating the whole thing with a fork & knife. It had a nice blend of flavors so it was easy to understand why this is their signature menu item. The downfall was that this was the only item that was worth the cost ($9 because I substituted the beef for chicken).  For $2.50, I think the portion of fries should be closer to a small basket. The ones I received were seasoned well but weren't worth the cost due to the quantity. My fiancé ate an entire Texas BBQ burger & the Cardinal Fries and was still hungry afterwards. The burger was made with 2 patties but it didn't seem like that much meat. There was something off about the Cardinal Fries .. the toppings tasted different, but I didn't have more than a small bite.  The part that was the turnoff was when we were leaving. Went to the bathroom quick, it wasn't clean at all, and we were about to throw away our garbage but when we opened it, other people's trash came pouring out because the bin was too full. Hopefully their kitchen is kept much cleaner than the dining area. Overall, not likely to return."}
{"text":"The best hidden secret in Phoenix. I love the addition of the cucumber on the burgers, they are always creative. The maple bacon pecan shake is also a must try for shake fans."}
{"text":"I don't consider myself a burger connoisseur so take this FWIW but by golly I thought their brulee burger was delicioso!  It was a perfect blend of salty and sweet - just a tiny hint of it.  I really enjoyed it and would drag my butt from the far west side again to have it.  The tator tots and French toast fries were both OK.  I'm a seasoned fries kind of girl.  The décor is simple.  The service was excellent.  They gave generous sized cups for water and I'm very grateful as I do not drink cola.  Would love to come again!!"}
{"text":"Visited PHX for my first time and found this place through yelp.  I ordered the special of the week which was Buffalo Brulee Burger.  One point of improvement is that they could add the price to the bottom of the burger.  I didn't know I was going to pay $8ish+tax.  It was fine since it's my 1st time trying it.  The cashier was pleasant, wasn't overly enthusiastic and seemed kind of bored.  He took my order and handed it over to the kitchen.  I did notice that the cook had to come out to see what other ingredients were in that burger.  I was quite perplexed by this.  Shouldn't you know everything on your menu by heart?  This is my second point of contention.  One thing I didn't expect was for them to bring the food to your table.  I thought that added a nice personal touch to it.  The meat was juicy despite them not asking me how I want my burger to be cooked.  The lettuce and scallions were fresh.  The cucumbers were cooked, not sure if people like that or not but I had no issues with it.  The buffalo sauce was flavorful and had a subtle kick to it.  Not enough kick to the point where you need water.  The burnt sugar bun was interesting.  You can see the sugar melted onto the bun but at the same time you could see the crystals.  Some of the crystals did not fully melt so when you bit into the burger, sometimes those crystals got stuck in your teeth or gave you a sensation of eating sand.  They just need to be more thorough.  If I had only tried this burger, I would have given them 4 stars, but I tried their french toast fries.  The french toast fries is exactly as it sounds, they basically take the corners of the bread, turn it into french toast, then deep fry it and put powdered sugar on it.  They also give you a side of syrup which was very watered down.  I think the fries would have tasted a lot better if they had more bread component than just the edges.  You can definitely taste the oil on these things so it should be toned down a bit.  The decor was alright, the light fixtures were kind of odd and not sure what they were trying to go for.  They do have good food photos of their products though.  The bathroom was okay.  Not terribly dirty, very spacious, but wished it would be a lot brighter inside.  Despite the 3 stars, I would definitely come back here again and would recommend this place with the caveat that not everything is up to par."}
{"text":"Holy Burgers and fries! This place really hit the spot. We got in a bit after they opened and ordered. I got the beachhouse and homemade bbq chips. My burger was  delicious the grilled green chili and pico de gallo really complimented the burger. The homemade chips had some amazing bbq seasoning. By noon the restaurant was packed. I would absolutely love to come back here when I'm in Phoenix next!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best burgers in town.  Service is awesome, food is fresh &made to order (I'm a bit picky and always have a special request or two which is always executed perfectly).  This is one of our \"go to places\" when we have friends visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the hype is about.  The burger was dry and didn't taste great.  I had the Paradise Burger with cheese. The test of a great burger is to evaluate the basic burger with out all of the other add-ons that disguises the true taste.  Paradise Valley Burger Company failed the test.    Now, about the fries....they add some sort of barbecue seasoning to the fries that is just not good.  They might as well serve up a bag of BBQ chips.   The place is very small and feels dirty.  They had boxes of Lucky Charms cereal behind the register and the place was just really messy and grimy.    Customer service was fine but they really need a deep cleaning and improved layout for a better overall experience.  I won't be back and cannot recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Nice little burger joint. Would give it a 5 but for the \"bun integrity\". It's a juicy burger especially with the sauce they out in it and the bun just didn't hold up.  Fixin's slip out and the bun tears. Tasty though. Lived the char grilled."}
{"text":"Really great burgers at a reasonable price. Good service too.Would have given 5 stars but the place is kinda dumpy. Worth a visit though. I will certainly return.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I can not even start  Felt dirty and most of the tables were dirty. no one bussing tables. Not happy with the food other than the frys.   Just very excited to visit but very disappointed and will not return."}
{"text":"Now this place on the other hand deserve a FOUR STAR **** The food is fantastic!  i just wish they expand the place because it;s a little small but it's a good place to eat :)  EA"}
{"text":"This is my first time at this place and it was AMAZING. The staff here were super friendly, very down to earth. I got the burger brûlée and it was very good a decent size ! I felt the maple syrup on it was a little over powering but overall very good. I also got the French toast fries and I never thought they would make it as French toast with a side of maple syrup; I thought the fry would be made out if a potato.   Overall amazing food! Must try!"}
{"text":"Little restaurant in a small plaza. Big variety big flavor. The burger was quite tasty nicely balanced flavor with good meat. The cardinal fries had a little kick to them. Serving size was not to big or small, about perfect. I'm not much into smothered fries but these I think I'd do again. I didn't have a ton of fries with no stuff left over and they were nicely flavored with a touch of spice.  Then the Canadian tots. They are different. Sweet potato tots with maple syrup and Serrano chili and bacon. I wasn't sure what to expect. You get this nice sweet tot and then the chili kicks in.  Whew. I liked it but it was a little more kick than I thought and took me by surprise.  All good mind you.  They also have shakes again not run  of the mill.  There's lucky charms, the pop tart....  well you get it.  Fast friendly service and a kids menu. If I'm the area again hankering a burger with a twist I'd stop by."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Worth the drive to Paradise Valley! The burgers are delicious. I love how light the bun is as to not distract from the wonderful taste of the burger. The addition of cucumbers and pickled onions add a nice cool touch. Try the sweet potato tots and the French toast fries.  The service is amazing, and everyone there was very friendly. Don't be distracted by the strip mall location, the food does all the talking!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place because I love burgers and this was featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives but I wasn't blown away by the burgers. It was okay, just average in my opinion. Maybe this is considered good for Phoenix though. Nice servers, place looked clean and burgers tasted okay. We got the Brûlée burger and Beachhouse burger. The Beachhouse burger was a little bit bland and the brioche bun was a bit too sweet for my liking. Not much flavor overall and kind of dry. And the brûlée burger had a lot of flavor but I'm just not a fan of the sweet sugar.  I did really love the picked onions though but I think I like my burgers a bit more traditional. The fries were great!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Cool hole in the wall style burger spot. The burger with the gravy on it is the best and their sweet potato tots are the awesome."}
{"text":"Unique burgers - interesting menu, friendly staff!  Been there twice - Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was great, and very reasonably priced. Thanks! Next time I'm getting my own shake."}
{"text":"Today there was something on the chalkboard called \"Banh-mi Fries\" which should have been called \"Saigon Poutin\" or \"Vietnamese Inspired Poutin\" because that's what it was, and oh, so good; fries with crispy onions, peppers, cilantro, pulled pork, smoked mozzarella. This is a meal in itself. The flavor combo was great. A hit of nouc mam would push this over the edge in a good way. I hope this becomes a regular featured item (in fact, it would be awesome to see more riffs on poutins)."}
{"text":"Damn good burger! I had the brulee & hubby had the parmesean. No leftovers! Absolutely delicious and great service. Support local!"}
{"text":"The fries were delicious but their country gravy was gross. It was so thin it looked like ranch dressing and made the burger all soggy. I will still try it again just not that burger because the fried onions are delicious and the fries were awesome.."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in Phoenix. The burger brule was awesome, the bun they use is really tasty!  Try the lucky charm shake!   Great staff, very friendly! We will be back"}
{"text":"You are already eating enough carbs, why would you put sugar on top of the burger.  The concept I appreciate, but the portions oz of the Burger patty I do not.  I weight around 183lbs and after finishing a Burger with fries and a drink still felt hungry, and I mean a lot.  I think the chef should focus more in bringing natural big flavor to his burgers instead of plain sugar.  Like poblano peppers, chipotle, caramelized onions, jalapenos, Blue Cheese and not just rely on the show Tripple D for its reputation."}
{"text":"I've lived near this place for a long time but went for the first time this past weekend. What a treat! I had the bacon cheeseburger and it was amazing! Brioche bun, pickled onions, amazing flavor! DH had the sweet potato tots, which were the best! Bacon, maple syrup, and jalapeño. Sounds like an odd combo but really was amazing. DH also got the blueberry shake, which was incredible."}
{"text":"Always excellent tasty love bringing all my friends to try it out yummy.I told my in laws it was a party in my mouth lol"}
{"text":"UPDATE The owner/Manager  reached out immediately after I posted my review. Very considerate and offered us a second chance at the restaurant. All places have bad days- it's how the Manager/Owner responds that shows the true story. He was not happy to know I was not satisfied with my visit and will most likely inform his staff they need to step it up-  that is what is important. He offered to buy us lunch the next time we come in. I don't post my reviews in order to receive a free repeat visit but to offer up advice to help the restaurant. We will give it another try another time without the kind offer of having our lunch paid for. Will update after we go back. Thanks You! Truly appreciate you reaching out."}
{"text":"Always tasty and such fun combinations.  There isn't a bad item on the menu.  Love the shakes and the sweet potato tater tots!"}
{"text":"If I could, the rating would be 4 and 1/2 stars. The food and the service was great.  A friend of ours told us about the Paradise Valley Burger Company. I honestly thought that 2 Hippies was still there (even though PVBC has been there since June or so). We went at 7pm on a Saturday and were the only ones there but from what I understand, they do a pretty brisk lunch business.   When he hasn't eaten somewhere, my husband always asks the employees what he should order. The guy behind the counter said without a doubt -- the Brulee Burger. Being a boring burger gal, I got a plain cheeseburger. We also got the sweet potato tots, chips and he got a milkshake.  The burgers were excellent. The buns were fluffy and so delicious! The brulee burger was so flavorful. and at $6.50, the prices were very reasonable. We both were very pleasantly surprised. Truthfully, from the location, we weren't expecting the level of food we got. You could take the same food and serve it in Old Town Scottsdale for twice the price!   We are certainly going to go back and try more of their menu. I'm looking forward to the french toast fries and I think that the Country Fried burger is next for my husband.  The only negative would be the physical space. It is sparse and a bit kitchey. I feel there is a disconnect between the space and the food."}
{"text":"This place was great! The cardinal fries (i think that's the name) were incredible. Loved the flavor. The sweet potato tots were good too. I got my kids the kids paradise cheeseburger to split and they even put it on separate plates for my boys. Everyone was so sweet and friendly."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and had a good time. The service was very good and felt welcomed and appreciated. The burgers were not very flavorful. I got the booze burger and my wife got a BBQ burger. Both tasted bland and did not have much flavor. It was not horrible just not good enough for us to go back. Hoped it would have been better after watching DDD."}
{"text":"High quality cheap eats. The guys were great, friendly and interested in how we learned about the place. They've got a great and unique menu - definitely try the Brûlée burger - a great mix of salty and sweet. The seasoned fries are good - the tater tots were a little sweet but maybe would do better with a sandwich that is not sweet as well.  Glad we stopped by - will be back again!"}
{"text":"If a hamburger has no hamburger, is it really a hamburger? After seeing Paradise Valley Burger Company on a diners drive-ins and dives episode I figured why not go while I'm in the greater Phoenix area?  The place is pretty shabby on the inside, but I'm here for the food. I ordered the $7.50 Beach House (Roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella, pico de gallo) protein-style (still watching my carb intake!) I have to say that the sandwich was right on the spot from a taste perspective. The only thing that was lacking, and it reminded me of the Wendy's commercial, was the lack of beef present! They say that there's over a quarter pound of beef (I know that's the pre-weight prior to cooking) but I really have to say that the beef must've deteriorated on the grill because there was relatively none present. So this brings up the question: If a hamburger has no hamburger, is it really a hamburger?  Whatever, the taste was really great (either that or having lunch at three in the afternoon probably wasn't a good move on my part). Here's the rundown:  Satisfied? Yes  Return? No Advocate? No"}
{"text":"Wow! BEST BURGER I'VE EVER HAD! My wife and I live close by and have driven past countless times and have noticed the small inconspicuous sign but never stopped and eaten there. After a day of trying to recover from an alcohol induced evening the night before, we set out to find a good burger joint to cure our greasy hangover food craving. After looking at every place(and we've eaten at numerous ones in the area....most of them very good) within a 5 mile radius, we stumbled upon PVBC and for half the price of every other decent place around, we got twice the flavor if you ask me. Do not allow the understated location or appearance to deter you, their pickled onions(and I usually hate onions) and cucumber toppings will blow your mind with the unexpected flavor that comes from it. We played it safe this time and just went with the Paradise CHZ. After adding the brûlée option to the bun(DO NOT short yourself and order without), and choosing the thousand island dressing to top it off, this burger far exceeded my expectations and will hopefully do the same for you."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite burger places in Phoenix.  I have been here at least a dozen times and it as consistent as it gets.  Ive only done the Paradise burger and a side of fries as well as a  chicken club sandwich so I cant speak about the rest of the menu but have no doubt its amazing.  The burger is juicy, flavorful and the seasoning on the fries are exactly what I want my fries to be like.  I actually order the fries with extra seasoning because they are that delicious.    The complex its in is not particularly nice, even borderline shady (had a few weird encounters due to the liquor store next to the place)  but its well worth going inside.  The staff have always been friendly and know their customers.  Its borderline a five star for me because the food is really that good, but the actual establishment inside is pretty tiny and cramped. I almost wish they could buy out one of the places beside them just to expand the seating because I most certainly do not want them to move locations since its so close.  Its unpretentious, values its customers, and overall a gem.  Another well deserved highly rated restaurant in phoenix and for good reason."}
{"text":"Really small burger joint, really big flavor!  I've only been here 2x now, because I always forget they're here.  My loss, I suppose.  Need more advertising to remind us, because you're tucked away in an insignificant strip mall that many of us just to the east care not to visit.  Too bad you're not over at Tatum & Bell where you'd have more exposure and would constantly remind me I need to return.  Hopefully, it won't be 6+ months before I make it back to you, but until I do keep flipping and crafting those crazy and awesome flavors!  Chris Birchby"}
{"text":"Very cute spot, great service and the burgers are amazing! I recommend getting the portobello mushrooms on your burger and the Cardinal fries! Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Found it on Diners, Drive in and Dives. Driving through Phoenix decided to try. Glad we did, everything we ordered was awesome tasting. We had  the Beach House burger, the beef tacos , the Paradise Bacon CHZ and a Paradise cheese burger. This is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Great  place but only go here if you're  ready to take your burger eating to another  level.  They have so many different twist to a burger. I started with a maple,pecan,and bacon shake it sounds funny but oh so good once again let me know that anything can be made better with bacon. You have to try the sweet potato  tater tots delicious. I tryed the  daily special which was a burger that had ground lucky charms mixed in the bun. Diffently  a new experience and they topped it with funyuns. Can't  wait to go back and take another burger journey."}
{"text":"Living in Rome, Italy, I always want a good burger when I am stateside. PBC did not disappoint. The portion was perfect and the burger so so so good! Seasoned fries were delicious and the jalapeño ranch had just enough bite to remind me why I miss the desert. Next time, must try a shake!"}
{"text":"Awesome great burger great fries great slaw I wish this was right by my house I would eat here every week"}
{"text":"Really really really good place. I live so close to that place and never bothered going in there. But it was totally worth it. I am vegetarian and got the Pulled Veggie Sandwich and the Sweet Potato Tots. The sandwich was so juice and I was really surprised to get such a good veggie option at this place. The tots were amazingly fresh and you could literally taste the sweet potato in every single bite. Definitely not the last time in there!"}
{"text":"When I have a taste for a good burger, I think of them because they do have tasty burgers. I have to drive a little farther to get there now a days, but it is so worth it. Bacon cheese with caramelized onions is amazing. I've been going to then since they opened and popped in today for a long awaited bomb ass lunch. So glad to see you guys doing so well!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had in a long time! Juicy and delicious! Wife grabbed a ship club and loved it as well!  The service was great and friendly. The wait was reasonable. A couple more bucks than I would like to spend, on a regular basis, for lunch. But I can without a doubt say the price is absolutely worth the taste!  Will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Ok, this one has been a long time coming.   So basically my friend and I affectionately refer to these guys as the burger gods. The thing to note here, is they have a new special burger every week. If you go here, you ask for the special. If it doesn't sound like something you'd like, I'd encourage you to try it anyway. These guys do incredible, magical, delicious things with ingredients I never thought would work with a burger.   So once you've gotten your special fix in; when you go back again that week, and you probably will, they've got a slew of other finely crafted dishes. The Club sandwiches are both great in their chicken or shrimp trims. The Fresno style pork tacos are brilliant. Sides are the house's masterful take on classic burger joint sides, decadent fries, sweet potato tots, and for those with a sweet tooth, French toast fries.   Wash this all down with one of many different sodas from the fountain or the large variety of canned ones they keep in a cooler. If soda isn't your thing, fresh cucumber water is available.   For the sweeter side of things, they offer a large sampling of milkshakes and run a special flavor for a month. Fried ice cream is also on the menu but the unique flavors of milkshake offered are really the best bet.   The staff is always friendly and happy to chat. Service is usually quite fast even when busy.   If I had to say anything negative about the place it's that I've gotten burgers or sandwiches they've been missing a topping. It's only happened a couple times, and the food was still perfectly delicious otherwise.  I know with the specials that the chef does play with them a bit for fine tuning so maybe I've just caught them in that phase.   The only other negative would be that you have to go there more than once a week so you can try the special and get to try the rest of their awesome regular menu.   If you've managed to read this far I'll let you in on a little secret. The Texas BBQ burger isn't on the menu but can be ordered any time. This is my all time favorite BBQ burger ever so definitely try one."}
{"text":"Went back to have the brûlée burger again, two days after my first try. It was good, but bf's cheeseburger was very soggy. The carnival corn had strangely tiny kernels."}
{"text":"You must eat here! Take off your shirt, and don't eat in the car these burgers are filled with tons of goodness. Sweet potato fries OH MY! Brulee burger rocks."}
{"text":"Excellent hamburger, the way you like it. Fries too, but I watch my weight. Attentive staff. Small. Camaraderie among the guest. Tucked away, but once you find it you won't forget it."}
{"text":"Delicious burger, fries, and amazing Brussels sprouts on the special menu.  Literally the best I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"AMAZING hamburgers. The lucky charms milkshake is probably the best milkshake I've ever had. The service is always very quick and they are always courteous."}
{"text":"Maybe I had high expectations of this place, but the food didn't impress me, especially for the price. I ordered the beach house burger and sweet potato tater tots. The burger wasn't anything too special, and the tater tots left me feeling the same way.  Like other reviewers mentioned, the venue itself looks like a fast food joint. Which is cool and all, but doesn't work with the gourmet food/prices, at least not for me."}
{"text":"I don't usually review, but stopped in here based on other reviews and was glad I did. Tried the beach house burger and it was awesome. Burgers were perfect and not dripping grease all over. Buns looked homemade and were toasted. Definitely would come back again!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the exterior this hole in the wall blew me away. Really unique menu it was hard to choose. Chicken fried burger with sweet potato tots did not disappoint. Crispy, melt in your mouth, bomb flavor! And the bun is the best! Will go back and take hubby next time. The new pizza shop next door had Oreo cannolis on sample and I have a feeling I'll have to go there too."}
{"text":"Winner! Great tasting burgers. They get everything right including fries & sweet potato tots and then check to make sure you're enjoying your meal. After we decided to try it based on Yelp reviews, we saw that it was reviewed in Phoenix magazine."}
{"text":"Gotta get the brûlée Burger it is SO good and sweet potato tots are AWESOME! I will be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"A friend and I were  on are way for a gamenight and had some time to kill.  But we didn't want to stop at any generic fastfood place. we saw this place on the way near a B.K. So we decided to stop and check it out.   The place has photo of the food on the wall and a poster that said \"Gorillas Love Milkshakes!\" He had the a burger and I had the pallpork. the Food look extraordinary, Mouth wateringley  delicious! However the palled pock was only average. the sauce was sweet and the pork was soft and fantastic!  A spice green pepper was a nice teats too.   I would love to go again with another friend."}
{"text":"It was better than the curb appeal, but not as great as the reviews. The flavors were great and very unique, however, the patty size left something to be desired. The patties were thin so we left hungry. If the patties were thicker the same receipts would be five star!"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome departure from the usual suspects (In-N-Out, Chuckbox, Deluxe Burger).  They have some really creative burgers and some awesome touches (pickled turnips on the burger was amazing...reminded me of Shawarma places in Montreal) and of course their amazing sweet potato tater tots.  The space is a little small, and because it's good it gets packed but the turnover is also pretty quick so the wait to be seated isn't too bad.  It's well worth the wait.  I came here when they first opened and came back just recently with some family who had never been here, and they loved it.  I'm glad to see it doing well."}
{"text":"I often pass by this tiny hole in the wall, but today I finally had a chance to taste the burgers. I purchased the Paradise Burger and it was absolutely wonderful! The buns was just done right and the patties were seasoned perfectly. I love the idea of having slices of cucumber in the burger and the onions that they use makes the burger oh so good! I will come definitely come back! One of the best burgers I have ever tasted!   I recommend!!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical but everyone is correct, this is the BEST burger ever!  We both tried the Crème Brulee Burger and thought how could that be good but the combination of flavors was amazing.  We also had the French toast fries - to die for and also BBQ chips and sweet potato tots....  We will be back soon.!!!"}
{"text":"This place has really great food. The Brulé burger was fantastic. Would have been five stars but the actual restaurant is falling a part a little but not enough to warrant any concern. I'll go back 100%"}
{"text":"Always great service and excellent food! They spend time crafting their burgers! Today I had their special which consisted of two beef patties, Cajun-style crab cake, herb aioli, bacon, fresh cilantro slaw, fried egg, and sage! What more can you ask for!  Try the house made chips to compliment your meal!"}
{"text":"Yum! The Burger Bruele is amazing... Who puts caramelized sugar on their bun?!? These guys do and thank you!"}
{"text":"I was happily surprised when I saw the Paradise Valley Burger Company's listing on Yelp.  Since our recent return to the Valley, I've been hunting for restaurants that have opened in the year we've been away.  A new(ish) burger place, just a mile from my house? With good reviews? It didn't take me long to find an excuse to have lunch there.   I was a little confused about the setup - order at the counter? Table? Counter it is.  I ordered the Brulee Burger.  Great choice!  The burger was super tasty, the bun was perfect, and the burnt sugar was an unexpected delight.  The only issue? The fried egg was cooked so little that the entire yolk just poured out and onto my plate. Icky mess!  Next time, I'll be sure to specify the have it fully cooked.  Other burgers at our table received good reviews, with the exception of the fried onion topping.  It was over-fried, to the point of tasting burned (and not in a good bruleed way).  I was disappointed that their french fry seasoning contains gluten, and the portion was pretty small.  This is not a side to share with a friend.  They also seemed like they had been cooked from frozen, and not fresh.  Favorite part of the meal? Milkshakes.  I had some questions about the milkshake ingredients, and was a bit skeptical when they told me their recipe... but dang.  That was a reeeeaaallly good strawberry milkshake.  The marshmallow milkshake was also delish, with lots of frozen bits of marshmallow fluff floating through it.  Mmmm!  There were some great things about PVBC - and some things that they can definitely improve on.  Their creativity with the menu is great. All-in-all, they have seriously potential, and I know that I will go back many times if they continue to improve."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the 1st time. Was told what they were \"known for\", and given time to review the menu. Ordered a basic burger and fries. It arrived quickly and was exactly what I ordered and was outstanding. They have some exotic things that aren't my taste, but I'm sure they would be really good. Reasonable price, and laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to this little hole in the wall you are absolutely missing out! The burgers are phenomenal!  Their unique combinations are off the charts... Or if you like something simple their bacon cheeseburgers are also divine. You have to try their sweet potato tater tot's! The restaurant itself is very simple, very basic but my husband and I usually order to go and enjoy these amazing burgers at home!"}
{"text":"Family Owned and Operated hole in the wall restaurant that makes Tasty Burgers, Sandwiches, Tacos, and Taco Salads. Inside is clean and tidy with cool pictures of some of his specialties on the wall. Service is Friendly and Fast. They were in Phoenix Magazine back in July 2012 for Cheap Eats for $12 or less.  Specialty Burgers include: Country fried burger smothered in gravy topped with crispy onions. The Beach House burger with roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella and pico de gallo. The Burger Brulee with a fried egg, bacon, onion, burnt sugar and havarti cheese. The Burger Parmesana with marinara, mozzarella, parmesan and basil. They also have your basic versions as well as a Grilled Portabella. You can substitute chicken breast on any burger if you like.  Sandwiches include: Grilled cheese, Breakfast club, B.L.T, Sloppy joe, Pulled Pork, Chicken club, Pulled vegetarian, and a Shrimp club on a choice of white, 9 grain, or a brioche bun.  Today I went with the Paradise Bacon CHZ with an extra patty and a side of seasoned fries. It was very good. The wife had the Chicken Club on 9 grain with a side of sweet potato tater tots which I got to help finish.  Definitely going back to try some of the other menu choices like the tacos, some carnival corn grilled on the cob and maybe some DEEP FRIED Ice Cream with honey, strawberry and whipped cream.  Keep it Local when you can. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"I'm here to just add more stars to this Burger joint.They are very creative and top the best combinations on their burgers. It's like a party for your taste buds. If you are in the area it's a must!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Amazing burgers every time I've came in. You can tell that this place takes pride in their work. Genuine customer service and creative, tasty burgers make this restaurant a great to go spot when you're hungry!"}
{"text":"Interesting variety of burgers accompanied by different types of buns. This is some gourmet sh$t right here. Shakes are awesome too. Staff are generally friendly. I got their creme brûlée burger as well as the burger with the gravy. The creme brûlée one was interesting and quite good. I did not care for the gravy in the gravy burger but the burger was good."}
{"text":"Very, very good restaurant. Great burger I had. A little hippie restaurant. Fun little place. Only complaint...closed on Mother's Day. It's not a national holiday. That was lame. Brought my family there because I was talking about how amazing it is...and BOOM!...close for Mother's Day, the sign reads. lol   Alright...whatever.   Still a thumbs up.   Will go back, I'll just make sure there's NO holiday of any kind when I take family and/or friends."}
{"text":"First time here. Came on a whim and I'm glad we did. Food was great. I was skeptical when they said all the burgers came with 2 patties but they aren't huge so it made sense. The sweet potato tots are AMAZING!  I had the booze burger and it was so tasty. Well worth the price and definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Very high quality ingredients!  The owner is super friendly and extremely creative! YUM!"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews we were excited to try this spot. Unfortunately,  we were disappointed.  Definitely not a fan of the seasonings on the French fries. \"All the fixins\" that came on my burger was too much...too many things were pickled and the flavors did not mix well for my taste buds. Nice place, but not for us."}
{"text":"Well done. I would go back for more to try the other burger combos. I ordered the Brulee burger which was sweet and rich. Next time I would go bacon cheese and keep it simple. I live close to this place, and it's the best burger spot in my neighborhood.  To the haters who give poor reviews after ordering the tacos and pulled pork, you are idiots. ORDER A CHEESEBURGER."}
{"text":"Its official, I'm leaving my wife.  I am leaving this exquisite and undeniably beautiful half eastern indian, half white chick for the Brulee Burger and Paradise Valley Burger Co.  It has to be done, I am in love.  Everything on this burger works together like 100 bikini clad women chasing Benny Hill.  The beef, the bacon, the fried egg with the drippy yolk, the havarti, the burnt sugar encrusted bun, I FACKING LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!  Not to mention, cool dudes run this place, cool dudes I say.    I am going to make my Dad drive down from Tucson just to go to this place.  He is getting old now and shouldnt be making that drive by himself.  But he loves burgers and PV Burger company is worth the risk.  Thanks AZ yelpers, you did me right homies!"}
{"text":"Saw it on DDD and had to check it out. Small place located in a low key strip mall.  Came on a Wednesday afternoon and the place was semi empty.  Places our order of the brûlée burger and deep fried burger with sweet potato tots and French stick fries and sat down. Food came and it blew my mind away. The brûlée burger was amazing with the signature sugar burnt buns and fried egg. The deep fried burger hit all the right savory senses with its cheese sauce. And the best part of all was the French toast fries. Who would have known that the best French toast I've ever tasted would be in fry form? My only complaint would be that the burgers were a bit in the wet side. Every bite I took was accompanied by a handful of napkins soaking up the juices that streamed down my hands and wrist. However this is not a bad thing for everyone but definitely to be noted. Overall it was a great lunch and would go there again real soon."}
{"text":"This as superb meal of Hot Steamy Messy deliciousness!!  We tried all fries and three different burgers.  We all agreed that this is a repeat place for us, even if it is a 30 minute drive for us.  We WILL DEFINITELY be coming back!!  I often drive in this direction, I'll make it into a new lunch spot.  I highly recommend  this spot!!  Oh, BTW, ALL their Fries are awesome!!  You have to order them all!!"}
{"text":"We ordered by phone for 2 burgers and 2 fries, they said it would take 45 mins, wow! My husband went to pick up our order 45 mins later and it wasn't ready. He waited another 15 mins to pick up our order. Burger was good, but fries were better. Be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Had lower expectations given the humble exterior and setting, but this place is to die for. Sides were so tasty, burger was just perfection...and the milkshake. The milkshake to end all milkshakes. See you again soon!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. I ordered shrimp tacos and fries, it was nasty. I don't understand how this joint has almost five stars.."}
{"text":"Was told this was the place to go! Ordered the Chicken Tacos Competition Style. They come with 3 tacos per order which is more than enough for one person. Really digging the fried onions which made the tacos. I also ordered the corn salad with bacon topping - a special of the day. Light and refreshing with a crunch.  Food was excellent.  The guy working the cashier couldn't have been nicer. He brought out our food. Came out to check on us after we were eating. He even told us to leave our baskets at the table and he'll take care of it.  Food and service - win/win."}
{"text":"The burgers are juicy and amazing screw going to BK or the Mc. Even tho it's a little more money I wouldn't go any place else in the valley for a burger"}
{"text":"The place was clean and bright. The portions/burgers were small but OK. My buddy had the Chicken Parmesan burger and though it was small - he raved about it. Specifically the sauce. The bearded bald guy at the counter was super mellow - not sure if he was smoking \"Colorado cigarettes\" or what. This place isn't bad but it's not that great."}
{"text":"Literally, so delicious. Their specialty burgers are unique and their sweet potato tater tots are to die for... Love this place, love the staff. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Darn good burgers at this place. Service was friendly. I love giving my money to businesses that actually deserve it. Yes, sir. I would go back for another."}
{"text":"So good! Another tripple D spot! I got the ruben burger! And the lucky charm shake. Both very delicious! You gotta check this spot out!"}
{"text":"Solid, but not my favorite.  Maybe I'm more of a burger traditionalist.  I had two of their specialty burgers (St Patty's day and Southern).  SPD was solid with unique flavors.  Southern was bland to my taste.  I'd give them another try and go with one of their more traditional offerings.  Service was a little slow, but they were busy and I did not feel ignored, etc.  Owner was working the counter and did a good job representing his business.    My favorite burger out there is from Modern Burger.  There is now one in the Sky Harbor."}
{"text":"Great place.  Very inexpensive and great combinations of toppings on their specialty burgers. Fries had a good taste. We also had the pretzel fries special. It wasn't fantastic, but still original and tasty.  I will be back if I am ever in town."}
{"text":"Delicious burger with great toppings. I had the Cinco De Diablo burger. The bacon was very crispy, which I like. The patties here are super thin with a bit of a crispy texture. This isn't a place where you can get your patty your way. The fries are seasoned and come out hot and crispy. The food is very fast.   It is an \"order first at the counter\" place. The pricing is good value. With that, the interior is very basic. It's very much an eat-and-go place."}
{"text":"These guys are amazing and always busy,  for good reason. Even when busy,  though,  their customer service is great.  Definitely try the sweet potato tots and. There. Is there a bad burger here.  They were featured on Diners, Drive-ins,  and Dives pretty recently."}
{"text":"Great burgers, cool staff, great price. If you feel like a burger, hit this place up."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers! Wide variety of delicious burgers   Fresh meat. Highly recommended!! :)"}
{"text":"I love their unique combinations! They have a brûlée burger that is very tasty! Their California burger is also really! They have sweet potato tater tots which are also not served everywhere. The burgers are a bit small but don't let the size fool you they are still very filling due to the fact that they are packed with flavor! The combinations are very well thought out and everything I have tried I have liked from here."}
{"text":"I travel a ton for work and make it a point to visit the best burger joints in town. I had the special which is called the 1st date and it comes with garlic, mozzarella, Parmesan and 1/4 pound patty. I also ordered the sweet potato tots. The tots were fantastic and the burger was solid. I judge a burger on the quality of the meat and according to the guy at the register, they use a local 80/20 mix.  It was very good quality. My only complaint is the size and price.  It was $15 for a burger and tots. That's quite pricey for a 1/4 pound burger and what I perceive as a small order of tots. It was super busy so maybe I'm the only one that cares about value."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burger joints around. There are lots of things to choose from and the atmosphere is super chill and relaxed. My favorite is the beach house burger with sweet potato tater tots, and the house favorite is the brulee burger. I think they are both phenomenal. They also have a small menu to the side for the weekly specials and those can be very fun! Great place to come check out. They also have pizza next door!"}
{"text":"this place is one of my favorite burger shops!!! Once you put one of these burgers in your face, you'll be addicted!! They taste even better than they look!!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy unusual gourmet burgers than this is the place. The food was really good. It's a clean(ish) establishment, pretty basic inside, typical mom and pop burger joint.  I was weirded out by the staff as their personalities did not match the flair of the food. There was zero excitement from the guy behind the counter in his interaction with us or his kitchen staff. He barely looked us in the face and barely communicated. We just felt it was odd. I get more excitement buying a burger at Mc D's. Maybe we just caught him in a bad moment? With such a unique menu you would think they would help you navigate your choices? We asked some questions but was answered awkwardly so we just made a choice. We entered excited and ended up feeling awkward at the counter like the soup nazi was on the other side. There was no buzz inside. No music. Nothing. The atmosphere was dead. We felt like we didn't have a good or bad experience. We only ate a delicious burger.  The food came out quickly and the food delicious. I can't remember what the burger was called but it was really good.  I love hole in the wall places as I grew up on the east coast where it's all about the corner mom and pop type joints. Even though we enjoyed the food its never on our radar when choosing to go out to grab a bite. Maybe I need to try again? I really don't know how to rate it. Weird."}
{"text":"I originally thought this place was great. My food tastes great and the prices weren't bad. I got a bacon cheeseburger with blue cheese and some fries and a coke. It was all bomb. Towards the end of my night, my friend and I both got sick. We both got burgers from here and now we are laying in the bed sick AF. We are sure we got food poisoning. That's why I rated this place a 1."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers & fries! Stopped in for lunch after seeing this on Triple D, got the bacon and cheese burger. Great burger! Get the seasoned fries- for sure worth it!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place after watching it on diners drive ins and dives my boyfriend got the booze burger we were excited to try it but had no flavor! When knowing what's in it and etc we were excited to try it but didn't have flavor I got the beach burger it was good not great but good   Positive things about this place the sweet potatoes tots were amazing and the fries were also amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome staff, lucky charms shake is AMAZING, burgers are awesome and sweet potato tots are to die for!!!! So yummy!!!"}
{"text":"One of the most delicious burgers I've had in 20 years. I had a pork brûlée  burger. The textures brought together are amazing!!  And the burger is delicious!!!! So are the fries. Small place nothing fancy but go there for the food."}
{"text":"Delicious grilled cheese on homemade 9-grain! Employees are super friendly. Cute little diamond in a strip mall. I must return here and try a burger:)"}
{"text":"Gourmet burgers at greasy spoon prices. If you are looking for an exceptional taste experience for a reasonable price, this is it. Nothing fancy about the strip mall location or decor, but the burgers are really amazing. We had the Burger Brulee, made even more juicy from the soft cooked egg yolk, and the daily special Key Lime burger, cooked crispy in a graham cracker breading with a cilantro pesto sauce. Both had a touch of sweetness, which you can avoid with other choices if you don't like that. Definitely wanting to return to try out other things on their menu."}
{"text":"This place could as easily be called \"Cool Bro Burgers\" - low key atmosphere run by beared men who appeared in their 20's. Service was casual but prompt. This place gets 4 stars for creativity on the menu and 3 stars for execution/taste. The burgers all sound amazing. Mine was an egg and onion concoction. It sounded amazing but was just ok. I wasn't asked how i wanted my burger cooked. It was also gone too quick... I was glad i had ordered the sweet potato tots for an extra $2. They were very hot when served and were great with the jalapeno ranch. I would definitely try this place again because i am so curious about the rest of the menu but i hope to find one more satisfying in taste and bulk."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB.  The fries are fresh and crispy.  I have tried the creme brûlée burger and the country fried burger.  I like the country fried the best.  The gravy is phenomenal.  Peanut butter milkshake makes me happy!!!!"}
{"text":"We were skeptical when we walked in but ordered the Burger Brûlée and sweet potato tots and were not disappointed. So good!!"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers for basically the price of fast food.  I had the burger brûlée and chips.  It was the first time I've had a burger topped with a fried egg.  It was excellent and I would definitely have it again.  Service was very accommodating. Not much atmosphere - just good food."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Paradise Valley Burger Company for years now and last Saturday, we were in the area and figured we might as well give it a shot! Apparently it has been on Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives and the episode had aired on Friday so it was absolutely packed! But, we were there so we waited, and waited, and 45 minutes later our burgers arrived! I went with the standard PV Burger with cheddar and all the fixins. It was topped with pickled onions {love this!}, cucumber, tomato, lettuce, and a yummy sauce. It had two thin patties and a delicious soft bun. For sides, we ordered the sweet potato tots and seasoned french fries, both tasty!   The burger was good but honestly, not sure if it is worth ALL of the hype and definitely wasn't worth the 45 minute wait when we were hangry. I'm still a fan of In-N-Out for both price and taste any day! Total for two of us to have lunch here, it came out to a little over $20. Since we live so far away, we probably won't be back but i'm glad we finally tried it! Despite the slow service, the crew working there was SO nice and attentive!!"}
{"text":"(The continuing story of a yelp-loving couple seeking great locally owned joints, friendly service and a comfortable atmosphere for playing Magic the Gathering...)  DH and I hit PVBC today for lunch.  I got the Fresno Tacos, he went with the Brulee Burger.  Very fair pricing.  I though the tacos were pretty good - I will say it was my first experience with \"street-style\" tacos.  Three little guys with nice toppings and good flavors.  Hubby's burger dripped yellow egg with his first bite (I internally screamed \"EWWW!!!\").  He thought it was great, especially as his first experience with a fried egg on a burger.  The guy running the register/bringing out the food was friendly and the shop was neat with nice little tables and a very clean/girly bathroom.  This one is on the list!  MTG Score: DH 2 / Me 1"}
{"text":"Best burgers in the entire valley!!!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!  (From someone who has to eat protein style and without dairy so I'm missing some of the \"better\" things!! ;) ) lol"}
{"text":"The Brûlée burger will change your life. These guys are truly creative and their devotion to their craft comes through in their menu. They are the best in the Valley, bar none. Follow them on Facebook so you can see their Burger of the Week, which might not always be up your alley but it's always fun to see what they come up with."}
{"text":"Always a favorite stop...best place to get an awesome burger. Our relatives always ask to come here when they visit."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to this place for lunch. The burgers are legit and the service is friendly and prompt. but the fries..are AWESOME! We've been back a few times since and I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Love their burgers. Love the Pork verde fries! Lucky charm milkshake a plus!!! The grilled shrimp sandwich was a failure. Had to return it for something else. The clerk said it's not their best.  Staff is friendly. Great place for a hangover! Lol."}
{"text":"Short Version: Great friendly service. Kinda random location. Tasty and unique burgers. We got the Beach House (pretty plain), The Special (tasty), Burger Brûlée (best of the three). Also got the French Toast Fries (unique and tastes just as it sounds)  Long version: it was our first time here and it was kind of difficult to find the place because the sign wasn't lit up. It's also not in the best area of town but it definitely adds character to the place. We were immediately greeted by a friendly guy. He knew all about the menu and happily helped us with our order making suggestions for us. Great service. I got the special (11/11/13) which was ham, patty in an English muffin with a tasty sauce. It was definitely unique and tasty. It reminded me of a breakfast sandwich. It looked small but the burgers are all filling. My wife got the Beach House which was simple and rather plain compared to the others. My friend got the Burger Brûlée which was our favorite of the three. I'm a sucker for burgers with eggs though. Lastly we got the French toast fries which tastes exactly as it's described. It's very state fair-y as a friend perfectly described it. I didn't know if it would work but it absolutely does. However, I'd suggest only ordering one and sharing since it's rich. I would imagine I'd get sick of it if I tried to go it alone. \"It's dangerous to go alone!\" - Old Man in Zelda telling Link not to order his own French Toast Fries. It was a pivotal point in the game."}
{"text":"A buddy and I stumbled across this joint just by luck; it's easy to miss, hidden in a strip joint on Bell.    Walked in and I immediately knew this was something different.  There were simply tables and chairs, and a place to order your food, and then sit down and eat... just eat.  Gone were all the pretentious crap that some places toss in in order to justify the silly prices they charge for something as simple as a hamburger.  It was refreshing because here was a place that clearly was playing by it's own rules, and not some chain of silly, overpriced, restaurants that are popping up everywhere nowadays.  I often wonder how some of these a-hole chains came into being.  Dream sequence begins...   Corporate douchebag:  \"Hey, let's open a chain of hamburger joints.  What can we do where we can offer up average, crappy food but charge a ton of money for it?\"  Intern, saying as a joke:  \"We could give them free peanuts!\"  Corporate douche:  \"That's it!  What do we call it? \"  Intern looks up in surprise:  \"I was just kidding!  No one will pay twice as much for a hamburger just because you give them free peanuts!\"  C.D.:  \"Billy, let me explain to you how some people think.  You see, they will go for anything that appears trendy as long as you can convince them that simply charging twice as much for something makes them feel like they are in a special place- a place for special people just like them.\"    Intern:  \"That's crazy.  Are you telling me that people will pay more for something merely for the pleasure of thinking that just by eating at that place they will somehow feel better about themselves, when in reality they are just idiots who are wasting their money on crappy, overpriced food?\"  C.D. \"You're right, Billy. No one in their right mind would pay $10 dollars for a hamburger... with one exception:  certain people who live meaningless lives who think they are 'special' by discovering that 'new' and 'trendy' place that will make them feel special, even if just momentarily.  They'll still be the losers that they are, but that's where we come in and manipulate their meaningless life by convincing them that there really must be something special about our restaurant because why else would we be able to charge such absurd prices for something as simple as hamburger and fries?\"  Intern:  \"Well, that's just sad. You are catering to the lowest level of people's insecurities simply so they can feel like they fit in; it's manipulative and unethical.  You'll be lucky to find five guys out of 100 that are stupid enough to fall for something so ridiculous.\"  C.D. \"Billy, you're a genius... a f'&*^ing genius!\"  Well, this ISN\"T Wall Street and NO free peanuts. They sell food - EXCELLENT food. Their hamburger (bacon cheeseburger actually with smoked cheese) was FANTASTIC!  Fries were great, with some special seasoning that I couldn't quite make out, but made them a little spicy and yet sweet at the same time.  My buddy had the tacos and practically inhaled them.  Good parking.  Stop and get a handmade ice cone for desert afterwards at the place in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Best burgers in this area,..hands down. I had a Cheeseburger w/mushrooms and fries,..it was the BEST!!! I just moved to this side of town and this place ROCKS!!!"}
{"text":"This is great place, it's affordable and tasty take out!  I get the beach house with chicken since burgers aren't really my thing.  My husband gets the PV burger with harvarti along with sweet tater tots."}
{"text":"Great burger!!I ate the bourbon one..no sauce! I loved it. My daughter had the Diablo one she loved it. I would love that one to but no sauces! Best yelp recommend ever!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but some of these bad reviews are kind of ridiculous in my opinion. I'll never understand some of the things some people will complain about. What needs to be understood is this is a small local place with staff who take their time to make extremely good food. It is NOT a fast food joint.   With that being said, the boyfriend and I have never had even the slightest negative experience here. We are frequent guests and have loved it every time, both dine in and delivered. The staff are awesome and we personally think these are among the best burgers in the valley.  We will be loyal customers forever."}
{"text":"Get there early for lunch!  The line forms quickly.  Went with a group of 9 and everyone loved their meals!  Loved the sweet potato tots!"}
{"text":"Fantastic menu. Bf and I have tried almost everything they serve at this point!  I'm a vegetarian so I love their veggie options, definitely no run-of-mill stuff. I like the pulled veggie sandwich, yummy Smokey flavor. My kids love the French toast bites and I'm a huge fan of the veggie tacos, competition style. My boyfriend is obsessed with the brulee burger.  Only thing is there aren't a lot of tables and the word is out about how good the place is so it can get packed!"}
{"text":"I love pv burger and pizza both are Amazing. Food is fresh and hot . Oreo cannoli is so yummy"}
{"text":"Great burgers at a reasonable price with prompt service. What more do you want in a burger place? We went on a Friday night and it was busy. The place is small but we were able to get seats by the window. Lots of people were getting carry out, which is an option I'll have to check out next time. Our food was ready in minutes & it was fantastic. If you're looking for ambiance or an adult beverage this isn't your place but if you're looking for good food relatively quick definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger EVER!!! Who thought of deep frying a pretzel bun??? These guys! Amazing and unique combination of tastes. Everything on the menu: great flavor and affordable.   TIP: if they bring back the Ultimate Burger, get 5 \"for here\" and 5 \"to go\". Order French toast fries, seasoned fries, well you should really everything on the menu because they're all good!  I lied, I've never tried their tacos... I bet they're good though. Til next time..."}
{"text":"We came here to eat after seeing this location on Diner, Drive ins and Dives. It was Saturday Feb 14th at about 3:00. We assumed at this time of day it would no be so busy, we were wrong. :) I over heard the guy taking orders tell the people ahead of us it is about a 30 min wait for food. We were not starving so we were okay with that.  I ordered the Beach House burger, the Wife got a plain cheese burger, my one son ordered a bacon cheese burger, and the other son got the texas BBQ burger. We all shared a order of seasoned fries and sweet potato tater tots. We all loved everything!! I really enjoyed my burger and tried a bite of the BBQ burger and will probably order that one next time.   We all left happy and full. The food was worth the wait.   PS. I know some reviews talk about the staff in a negative light. We did not have a problem with any one. The employee taking the order was friendly and did not rush us even though there was a line of people behind us. I saw 2 runners who where taking food to people and they were busy but had smiles on their faces. There was also 1 employee walking around busing the tables as people left, he was also answering questions people had as they came in.   We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Okay, I know I'm late to the party here and a lot of what I'll be saying is probably not going to be breaking news about one of the valley's most recognizable burger joints.  But I'll differentiate a little by paralleling my experience here with another popular burger spot.  From start to finish I couldn't help but think about my experiences at Rocket Burger on the west side of town.  If you've been to both, you can probably understand the comparison.  A burger joint making one of kind burger and sandwich concoctions?  Check.  Next door to a public high school?  Check.  No frills setup in a strip center?  Check.  Of course both places have truly unique offerings too.  So let's highlight PVB's, shall we?  Find this place on the southeast corner of 40th Street and Bell.  Just across the street from Paradise Valley High School.  I saw plenty of Trojan students during my first visit here on a late Thursday afternoon and its perfectly understandable as to why.  Just as Rocket Burger lures nearby Moon Valley High School students with good food for cheap, PVB offers the same for PVHS.  Unlike Rocket Burger, PVB has garnered national acclaim.  Namely from one Guy Fieri and his famous (or infamous depending on your opinion) Diners Drives Ins and Dives show.  Admittedly I haven't had a lot of luck with Fieri's choices for good eats here in the valley so his blessing is something of a mixed bag (Yelp by contrast has been a much more reliable measuring stick).  Let's get down to business.  I knew my first visit would include one of their specialty burgers, but the choices were daunting.  As this was my first go around, it made sense to choose the burger labelled on their menu as \"SIGNATURE\".  That burger of course would be the Burger Brûlée.  A burger topped with a fried egg, bacon, onion, havarti cheese, and burnt sugar.  Certainly not something my gastroenterologist (or my dentist for that matter) would advise, but my taste buds were piqued with interest.  I was also curious about the french toast fries with maple syrup as a side so got one of those.  And lastly, a vanilla milk shake (ironically this was probably the healthiest thing I had for this meal).  Total cost including tax came to about $17.  Others have stated it, but I'll repeat.  The Burger Brûlée is phenomenal.  A rich, delicious, savory, flavorful explosion in your mouth.  All the ingredients were cooked perfectly, served simply, and the burger was summarily demolished by me in no time.  I wouldn't change a thing about that burger.  The french toast fries on the other hand?  Highly overrated in my opinion.  The syrup saves these fries from being complete disappointments, but even with layers of powdered sugar they didn't impress me at all.  Pretty flat in terms of texture and there was almost no french toast taste that I could discern.  Next time I'll probably try the sweet tater tots instead.  The milkshake was solid.  Dense, creamy, and just what I needed to wash down that cholesterol bomb of a meal and clean my palette.    So 5 stars for the burger, 2 stars for the french toast fries, 4 stars for the shake.  Overall I enjoyed my first go at this place.  Next time I think I'll try that Country Fried Burger for some good stick-to-your-ribs goodness.  Props to owner Bret Shapiro for bringing the north valley a terrific array of burger options at a price almost anyone can afford.  Despite only being open since 2011, PVB has taken off.  I don't know how or where Bret came up with some of these crazy burger ideas, but keep 'em coming!"}
{"text":"When looking for a place to eat, it's always a great sign when a place is packed with locals. Four and a half stars on Yelp gets me there. Seeing the crowd makes me get out of my car and jump in line. Though there are many creative burgers to chose from here, Im very traditional and ordered the cheese burger. I was not disappointed. Built with a fresh beef patty and the typical burger trimmings- lettuce, tomato and onion with a thousand islands sauce. The onions piled on to of the burger are a pretty pink from being sweet pickled. I could have eaten the onions all by themselves. It all went together to make one excellent burger.  The place is clean and the staff is friend. A great cheese burger experience."}
{"text":"Good burgers,  fries are addicting.  The staff so super friendly. Not a lot of area to sit, so useless you're comfortable with ppl right on top of you, take to go."}
{"text":"I love businesses that don't mind a little hand-to-hand combat.  In the case of Paradise Valley Burger Company, there is a Burger King a stones throw away in the same parking lot, a pizza place a few doors down, and a Jack in the Box across the street.  You better be good if your competition is that close.  They are.  The Princess and I had to check this place out after it was highlighted on the review of the day last Friday, 3/7/14.  Easy to find, just off the 51 at Bell.  Kind of  a non-descript strip mall.  Nice vibe, lots of foot traffic and yet enough room to grab a table and not be elbow to elbow with your neighbor.  We both had the Beach House burger, two patties, smoked mozzella, and pico on an incredible homemade bun.  Loved the burger, very, very good.  You could taste the grill marks on the meat.  Complimented the meal with the sweet potato tots.  These were fantastic!  Some of the best I've had in the valley! (a little pricey but worth it!).  Also had a maple-bacon milkshake.  Wow!  Absolutely incredible.  Real bacon and maple with tasty ice cream, it was delicious!    Can't wait to go back and try other burgers and some of their tacos.  Service was fantastic, very quick and friendly.  Great prices and excellent food!"}
{"text":"Ths Shapiro family does EVERYTHING perfectly!  Their secret burger sauce is the BEST anywhere!"}
{"text":"First time eating here after hearing about it. All I can say is that it surpasses the hype. From the food to the staff it brings 'phenomenal' back to the burger world. Just ate a specialty burger called the Sun Devil with some sweet potato tots and am finishing it a Take 5 shake...not because I am still hungry but more because I didn't want the experience to end."}
{"text":"I had the beach house burger, spicy fries and shared the sweet potato tots. Place is super casual with excellent service. Food came out fresh and hot. They served kerns fruit drinks in the can and Capri suns as well as the typical fountain drinks. I want to try the country fried burger next time!"}
{"text":"Great unique burger options. Fries a little too much seasoning. Don't let the exterior scare you off."}
{"text":"Any place that offers a well-executed bacon shake is worth trying.  I didn't even know that before I ate at PV Burger the first time, so it was a nice surprise.  My first visit, I went with the Brulee Burger.  It was OK.  Second visit, I had the Philly Burger daily special, which had two tempura-battered patties, cream cheese, and a couple other things.  The Philly Burger was pretty tasty, and maybe a step above their signature brulee burger.  The fries are pedestrian, but I haven't had any other sides.  Prices are a little steep here, and I like getting a shake, so now I tend to stick with just a burger and a shake just to keep my financial and caloric budgets under control.  I already mentioned the shakes.  I was skeptical of the bacon shake after the miserable bacon soda experience I had last year, but this bacon shake is done well.  It tastes like bacon, but it's not to strong.  And best of all, it has actually crunchy - and some fatty - pieces of bacon in it.  As edible as the bacon shake was, however, I would recommend the Lucky Charms Marshmallow shake first.  I think the bacon shake would need some maple in it to make it a contest.  PV Burger Co are artists.  They have really interesting ideas, and they execute it well.  It could be better, though.  They can't draw people by the quality of their meat alone, like some of the more high-end burger spots.  Drink selection is weak; a place like this really needs to serve some specialty bottled sodas, or at least something besides canned Coke products.  As it stands, though, PV Burger is an excellent neighborhood burger joint, and is probably even worth traveling a few miles out of your way to visit.  The bacon is calling for you."}
{"text":"If you want two OK tiny burgers and 1 side of fries 1 of coleslaw and 2 sodas for 29 bucks, you've found your place.   Also, since they have a big glass drink fridge with canned sodas, I'd assumed thats what they serve (fountain machine is out of site), so I ordered two diet cokes for myself and one coke for my guest. After I paid my credit card tab, the guy working there grabbed cups for fountain drinks and I clarified, oh I thought you guys dispensed just cans thats why I ordered two diet cokes.  Guess what, the dude gave me two fountain drinks and didnt say a word about the extra coke I just paid for.... Anyways, whatever, my mistake but have some integrity.   Next problem, check out the people working there and ask yourself if you want to EAT there. The guys are gross looking, I mean, shorts that are torn, shoes falling apart, and hats that look like they're crusted with a mixture of fry oil and horse shit.   Onto the food; I got a burger with a double patty the booze burger. I kid you not, each patty was the size of a half dollar. Size of a half dollar but cost about 8 bucks for that burger. Terrible, I'm more of a fan of smash burger or five guys over this place. At least they give you real portions and they're clean. I heard the cole slaw was really good. I got the seasoned fries, they put WAY too much seasoning on them. Caked in seasoning and salt, jeez, could eat about 5.   It was 1230pm when I ordered my two burgers with seasoned fries and slaw, took 45 minutes to get. Crazy. They weren't THAT busy. Also I asked the dude how long a burger usually takes, just friendly asked, he said oh it takes exactly 3 minutes to cook a burger here so pretty quick sometimes. Well let me ask you this. This is the paradise valley burger company right? Ever think people are going to be buying burgers from you idiots? Well than freaking cook more than one at a time when you've got a line of 6 people.... WOW, I should be the general manager over there, if I could tolerate the filth.    Not going back, don't recommend you go either."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! I had a bacon cheese with 1000 island dressing. The burger was great! The flavors blended together perfectly and the bacon was cooked to the right amount of crispness. I was a little skeptical of the picked onions but they ended up being delicious on the burger. The fries were also great! They were cooked perfect and were crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. The seasoning was not overdone. Definitely a good burger joint to check out!"}
{"text":"FUCKING AMAZEBALLS! First off, I'm a little bitch when it comes to spicy food. So when I heard jalapeño ranch all I could think was I'm screwed. But I decided to wear my big boy pants and try it, AMAZING! The frys were great, recommend getting the seasoned frys. Burger 9/10, got the bbq burger. My recommendation for a good solid lunch:  Bbq burger Seasoned frys Coke (the liquid kind) Jalapeño ranch."}
{"text":"I've tried the Brûlée burger before - pretty good, but wasn't in the mood for a burger that day...tried the BLT.  It was really good!  It's your basic BLT, but with jalapeño ranch - it really worked.  This really hit the spot.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"To say this place is divine would do PVBC injustice. I've been coming here since a couple months after it opened but I only just now learned what internet is so this review comes late. Short version of my review is that I used to go at least once a week. 40 pounds later, I decided this wasn't the best of decisions and decided to scale it back to once every two weeks. Anyway, if you want a burger joint that can satisfy your every need, this place is it. Their \"basic\" burgers are good but I never recommend them (let me explain). The owner, Bret, is a burger GENIUS and to not try his weekly specials is a sin. I'll be honest, you can get a regular ol burger anywhere but this man takes the time and effort to come up with a different concoction every week. I roll my eyes when I see someone order just a cheeseburger; why go to a place that offers a truly unique and mesmerizing experience to only order a plain cheeseburger?! If you don't go for the special, at least dabble with the Brulee or Booze Burger. The fries are amazing and compliment the burgers so well. And the shakes! Holy smokes those shakes are glorious. People complain about the location and decor but I think that adds to the charm. Burgers joints seem to be all the craze nowadays and all these burger places are the same; hip, new, \"cool\" places with TV's and bars and giant patios all to distract you from their sub par burgers that are ok but you leave thinking you just had an amazing experience when in fact, you just got served a frozen patty on a soggy bun with no creativity... Not here. PVBC let's their food do the talking! The place is small and cozy and the music selection is on point. Add that with some good friends and their food and that is all you need. The price is great for what you get. I know people complain about it but honestly, this isnt McDonald's, you're not going to get a meal for $6 or $7 people. I can't say enough about this place and I would definitely recommend PVBC if you are looking to break out of that plain, boring, repeated burger rut you're stuck in."}
{"text":"So simple, yet amazing. The burgers are just so delicious. My mother in law comes here to visit from Nebraska between 1-2 times a year and of course being from NE the meat is the best. We go atleast 3-4 times while she's here! I personally love the bruleé burger!"}
{"text":"\"Best Burger I have ever had.\" Came out of my mouth the other night as I was midway through my Burger. I hadn't eaten at all that day so you could say that, that MAY have had some impact on my judgment but I'm thinking, not much.   Pulling in to the parking lot I didn't know what to expect, but I was a little taken back by this \"hole-in-the-wall\" looking place. But it didn't phase me too much. (I later found out they were on Diners, Drive-in's, and Dive's. Made sense.) It's a small place, with a few tables and high tops. You definitely don't come here for the décor. You order at the counter and pay. They either call out your name there, or walk around calling out your order or name to give you your food at your table. We only waited about 10-15 minutes to get our food. Both of our meals were piping hot. It was hard to wait for it to cool off to take a bite. It all looked so appetizing. AND IT WAS!!  I got their Burger Brulee: Fried egg, bacon, onion, burnt sugar, Havarti. They burn the sugar on to the top bun. Oh My Gawd.... You get this delicious crunch and sweetness in every bite. That combined with the yoke from the fried egg and the bacon... it was perfection!!     My husband got the Special on the board that night.THE NEW YEARS FAILS-OLUTION BURGER:  beef patties, Havarti cheese, red fresno chili, maple/bacon/whiskey pesto, caramelized onion, and cinnamon served on a French Toast bun. Also a great burger. I really loved how crispy the French Toast bun was. Not soggy at all. The grilled 1/4 of fresh ground beef patties are really flavor packed and crispy on the edges. The Sweet Potato Tots were crunchy, sweet, and salty. The French fries were nothing special. Just your typical French fry.   I am really thinking this is going to be my new favorite burger place. I can not wait to come back and try more of their fun and delicious creations. This place is a must try if you are craving a scrumptious burger."}
{"text":"Love the local feeling of this burger joint. Ordered the Texas BBQ Burger minus the green chili. The bbq sauce with the slaw was a perfect mixture of flavors and the crunch of the bacon made it that much better. The meat was thin but still very juicy. Also ordered the carnival corn, very yummy. Wasn't a big fan of the Cardinal Fries. Maybe I will try the other fries with sloppy joe on top for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch this past Saturday & so glad we did, as we were walking up we could smell the deliciousness of an awesome fresh made burger!! This restaurant is located in a small strip & the restaurant itself is kind of small so we chose to sit outside where they had a few wrought iron tables to choose from. My hubby chose a table with our little one as I stood in line to place our order as there is no table service, the only problem we had was what to finally choose to eat because the narrowing it down wasn't that easy, love when that happens....lol!! So my hubby ended up choosing the Texas BBQ burger which had two beef patties, bacon, motz cheese, BBQ sauce & a homemade slaw on a brioche bun, he also chose to add a side of fries. Well he was completely in love with the whole combination, the burger was so filling he actually didn't have room to finish the last couple of bites. I chose a classic bacon cheeseburger with your typical fixings of lettuce, tomato, some thin slices of cucumber but hold the onions & mine was also on the brioche bun with a side of the shoestring fries. Once they brought out our burgers & I was done picture taking I was then able to bite into this heavenly, moist, delicious burger...... yep I think it's one of the best burgers that I have had!! Now the fries well they're another story, you may be asking yourself come on lady they're just fries but no no no they aren't just fries they're perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned awesome fries that are like a bag of chips where you can't just eat one!! Will we be back you may ask & the answer is yes but not soon enough!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I don't give this place a 5 stars is because I love fries, and I didn't think no one or any place will change that. Well...I was wrong!!! I don't care for the fries seasoning they use, it didn't complement the taste of the burgers. That's why is a 4 for me. The burger,  though... To die for. I ordered a Beach House and it didn't disappointed me at all. I will recommend this place to my friends. And next time I will order the fries with no seasoning and my visit will be a 5 stars."}
{"text":"Super burgers but the best part is the sweet and salty fries. Can't get enough! My husband loves the buttery roasted corn. I always say a burger is as good as its sides and this one wins!"}
{"text":"Scrum-diddily-umptious!  Anything that you get here will be awesome :)  The pickled onions are amazing and the taco salads hit the spot.  I also recommend the french fries (the seasoning has sugar in it!!) and of course the sweet potato tots!!"}
{"text":"This was the best burger and chips while in Scottsdale! A must if you want great burger,fries, and service. We were there 1 hour before closing and everything was great"}
{"text":"Came out to rei. Made a detour to this place. Let me tell you. Bomb af! Super tasty. Great service. Great prices. Got the beach house burger some slaw and sweet potato tots. Oh and a peanut butter shake! Laid back ambiance. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Step 1. Go to Paradise Valley Burger.  Step 2. Order the Burger Brulee, fries and a side of Jalapeno Ranch.  Step 3. Eat the Burger Brulee, fries and a side of Jalapeno Ranch.  Step 4. Leave Paradise Valley Burger."}
{"text":"Holy cow! Why do you Californians get so excited about In and Out burger when there are places like this? THIS is a burger joint worth a cult following!   I brought my wife and 18 year old son plus my parents here because we didn't have time to go to Rehab Burger Therapy in Scottsdale. Lucky us! When we walked in and immediately absorbed the divey atmosphere we were actually excited. We've had some of our best food experiences in local dives like this. Two of us ordered the Beach House burger, my wife ordered the Brullé. My son ordered a straight up Paradise Burger and my Mom got the Bacon Cheeseburger. Sides included fries, homemade kettle chips and sweet potato tots. Not a single negative thing to say about anything we ordered but one burger stood out.....the Brullé! That is one amazing burger!! As far as the sides go, you can't lose with any that we had but the sweet potato tots were extra special.   We wrapped everything up with a chocolate and vanilla milkshake and those were the only items we thought were just ok. That didn't diminish what was an amazing meal, however. Whenever we're in Phoenix, we WILL return!"}
{"text":"This is LITERALLY the best place in phoenix to get a burger. The owner is active in the restaurant and always happy to help. It is also vegetarian friendly, you can replace the patty with a Portobello mushroom. I always feel welcomed and at home when I come in to eat here. I take all my friends and family here. I will always return and I will always recommend. Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! I have tried several and they are all equally amazing in their own way. The burger specials are always killer. Their french toast fries melt in your mouth. I love a good condiment and they have special sauces to grab and go with your order in the cold fridge. Their milkshakes are also very delicious! Its in a very inconspicuous shopping center in the corner with plenty of parking. I definitely recommend going here and trying something that is not your typical burger!"}
{"text":"Interesting menu and a fresh take on burgers. Always have a unique special, love this place."}
{"text":"There were four of us paying separately, and they asked to make sure we all got our food at the same time. It came out quickly and it was delicious. I spilled my lucky charm milkshake and they immediately came out to clean it up for us. Then they brought me a new one free of charge. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"First time here. My daughter has been pestering me to come try this place for weeks.  And its definitely well worth it. Food is great and service too.  We had the Paradise Chz and Tacos.  That juicy beef with the melting cheese and pickled onions is just so awesome.  And you got to try the seasoned fries too!"}
{"text":"So happy I stumbled upon this burger place that offers vegetarian options. It is obviously very popular with a line almost to the door at lunch time. I was thrilled to see the \"pulled\" veggie sandwich on the menu, a unique and yummy meatless version made with cabbage and green chile. It would only have been better with some veggie meat strips thrown on, but I'm not complaining!  It's awesome that this place goes beyond the norm to create something special for the non-meat eaters. With fries and a Dr. Pepper, I had a very satisfying veg dining experience:) Thanks Paradise Valley Burgers!"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly. Small place so seating was adequate. Had the Booze Burger and chips with a rainbow shake (vanilla with sprinkles). Burger was good and I was not disappointed. I like their unique take on the burgers. Will have to try some others when I am in the neighborhood. Always like places that do homemade potato chips. The shake was very good too."}
{"text":"This is one of those totally unassuming places that has some amazing food! Not the fanciest inside and quite small but the service and staff are super nice and attentive and the food is totally stellar. Very reasonably priced as well! If your looking for a killer burger without the pretentious vibe of some of these \"gourmet\" burger joints, check this place out!!"}
{"text":"How can you not LOVE this place?! Every time I visit, I leave happy. I can never NOT order the French Toast Fries! AMAZING! Great place, really casual and awesome food."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers ive ever ate! Staff was very friendly. Had the pleasure of meeting the owner Bret and chatting with him for a bit. We were from out of town but he made us feel right at home. Got the special of the week the 'Bret burger' which was incredible. Bbq infused bacon, maple butter, corn bread crumbles, on a brioche bun. Are you kidding me!?! Party in my mouth. We also got the pulled pork sandwich which was very tasty, the sweet Potatoe tots, the pretzel fries, and Bret brought us out some french toast fries at the end. GET THE FRENCH TOAST FRIES.  How did i not think of that? ?? All in all it was a great meal and i wish i lived in town id be there weekly."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  The guys give great customer service and the burgers are always first rate. Their are also chicken and seafood options if you don't like red meat.  I highly recommend ordering the special of the day, no matter how weird it sounds. Its almost always a winner!  The music is great and the value is top notch.  This is a rare dive in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Came in here for a quick bite to eat for lunch and saw that this was on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives.  Unfortunately, I did NOT get any of the featured items on the show and so I wasn't too impressed.  I got the Beach House which had Roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella, and pico de gallo and I got the sweet potato tater tots.  The tots were the highlight of the meal, definitely get those and you can pair it with either chipotle ketchup or a jalapeno cilantro sauce.  Burger wasn't anything special, so next time maybe it's worth it to try the DDD items or one of their daily specials."}
{"text":"Great experience. Great food. Really enjoy it. Friendly, quirky staff. Always good food"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. I have to say, I love low key burger places like this. I see this place all the time driving around but made my first trip inside today, finally! The food was so good, staff was cool as hell, and my kids loved the sweet potato tater tots. Brûlée burger is bomb, I couldn't get enough. Def 5 outta 5 on this and I will be recommending this place to every single person I know!!"}
{"text":"Came here because of the ratings. Turns out not so great. Food was decent, but kinda pricy for what you get. Drink selection was weird. Place is rundown, floors greasy, and the guy working at the front was super inattentive."}
{"text":"GO HERE ASAP! This place doesn't look like anything great on the outside but the food is fantastic. Really cool/interesting menu. I recommend the Brûlée burger with sweet potato tots. Everything tasted fresh and very flavorful, one of the best burgers I've ever had. Also got the fruit loops shake."}
{"text":"Our burgers and fries were very good. They need to wipe their tables so people choosing to \"eat in\" can sit at them, also when a single person waiting to \"take out\" food sits at a table for four it creates a problem for those of us looking for a table to enjoy our meal at eating \"in\". I wish they would clean their condiment containers also. The salt & pepper shakers and the ketchup containers sitting on the tables are all very greasy. After touching them, you then touch your own food, it's kinda nasty."}
{"text":"Service is fast and friendly.  I like the pickled onions(?) that come on top of the burger.  Very tasty.  I LOVE the sweet potato tots too!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and was not disappointed, I loved both the burgers I've had. But my favorite of the 2 was the brûlée burger. The service is fast and good. My only compliant would be that they had a wasabi burger on special and it was a massive glob of wasabi on it. Made it too intense. But other thank that I loved it!"}
{"text":"Burgers are delicious and reasonably priced. Very creative! I'd definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Awesome.  The chef actually uses his imagination to make amazing weekly specials."}
{"text":"Simple concept taken to a whole new level. Creative burgers, delicious varieties of fries, and one of the best milkshakes I've had in a long time. I had the Beach House burger which is a burger with Roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella, pico de gallo. It was outstanding. A friend had the Brûlée burger which is Fried egg, bacon, onion, burnt sugar, havarti. It was heavenly. My husband had Paradise burger which is 2? beef patties beer battered and fried, smothered with a green chili/vodka/bacon cream sauce. Topped off with smoked fresno chilis pickled in whiskey! It was amazing. We had the sweet potato tater tots, the french toast fries (which really should be on the dessert menu) and the carnival corn. It was all really good.   The place is small so be prepared to wait for a seat. Everything is made to order so don't go if you are in a hurry. This place is meant for slow enjoyment. We will definitely be back to try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"For a hole In The wall burger joint this is place is fabulous.  We arrived on a Friday night with a bus load of out of town college volleyball players and we found seats, ordered and enjoyed our dinners. All the orders were correct, came out quickly and were delicious.  Prices are reasonable, food was plentiful and the menu has a good variety of options. I didn't care for the sweet seasoning on the fries but others in our group loved it. If I was a local, this place would be a regular destination for us."}
{"text":"I didn't think this place was worth the hype.  I had the the booze burger.  The overall flavor was good, but the patties were thin and overfried.  I did however enjoy the sauce."}
{"text":"With creative menu items like the lucky charms shake this hole in the wall is a cool find.  In addition to good food you can feel great about supporting local. Right across from PV HS."}
{"text":"Best burger joint on BELL ave. I drove 42 miles just to try this place and damnit it was worth it. I ordered the \"burger brûlée. Sh** was bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Horribly average and over priced. Customer service is lacking. Burgers don't come with fries so it's not as cheap as people say it is. 8 bucks for a very small burger all cooked well done. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"I had the bacon cheeseburger w jalapeño and it was terrific. The seasoned fries were a great addition. The food was so hot when delivered, we had to wait a minute before trying it. Great job!!"}
{"text":"yummy greasy burgers and fries!  burger was dripping with grease as i held it between 2 grilled to crispiness brioche buns, layers of crunchy lettuce, cucumbers, and pickled onions.  harvati cheese made it all the better! side of sweet potato tots which looked super cute..and tasted even better!  YUMS  while eating..this lady stood beside me on the phone and commented on how the workers in the kitchen should be wearing gloves while making the burgers??? i have no clue whether gloves are worn or not at this place..but their burgers and tots sure are delish!"}
{"text":"Bomb diggety, that's all you need to know. Not a fancy restaurant and it so doesn't  matter when the burgers are this delicious."}
{"text":"One of the better burger places in Phoenix, it definitely gives every chain restaurant a run for their money. Get the caramelized onions and then fresh jalapeños it makes a burger."}
{"text":"There is a reason why this little hole in the wall restaurant has 5 stars on yelp.  The food is ridiculous!!   Best burger I have ever had in my life.  The fries were perfectly cooked.  The gentleman who took out order was very pleasant.  It was a little warm inside the shop but I think it is because of the kitchen being so close?   This is my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"i had the country fried burger and seasoned fries. the fries were great and a small portion which is ok. the burger was disappointing. i ate one patty on its own and it was not seasoned or flavorful at all.  the bun was paper thin but the taste wasnt bad. its a popular place so i will have to go back for a regular burger. i WILL give you a second try!"}
{"text":"Quarter pounder with cheese and grilled onions was $7.50 with tax.   The burger was a little small for my taste.  I felt like I was eating a slider on steroids.  Lol  The burger was cooked right but I was expecting a more vibrant taste to the meat since these burgers are ground every day.     They did have a cool special this week which was like a Mai Thai burger.  I probably should have tried it instead of just a regular burger.  The Mai Thai is two beef patties, rum glazed onions, pineapple and Serano pico, coconut crusted avocado, green chili aoili, and smoked mozzarella for $9.50 which seems like a much better value."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a gourmet burger. I had their signature burger which includes an egg. At first, I was a little apprehensive, but then I took a bite. Wow! An explosion of flavor. I will be back when I'm in the area.  It has Coke products with refills. I didn't get a chance to try the fries, but they look delicious on the other tables plates. Very friendly staff. Good service."}
{"text":"I give this guy credit.  It takes guts to open a burger joint in a town with a bajillion other ones.  They all try to stand out from one another which is the one thing that makes them all similar to me.  Applying some type of schtick to over-priced meat is not all it takes to win my patronage.  Anyway....  My wife and I went here for dinner on Friday night.  It was about 7pm and the place was pretty dead which was nice.  It was us, a few workers and 2-3 other diners.  I didn't think so by looking at the place, but it really is a neighborhood joint.  Everybody seemed to know each other and there was friendly banter between some of the diners and owner/workers.  I got a real nice friendly neighborhood vibe from the place.  The food....  * Ceasar salad - Very good - a bit too much dressing but that's the way I like it * Burger Brulee - Interesting and pretty good - I give them credit for trying something different, but it really wasn't my thing.  The burnt sugar on the bun gave it a crunchy texture but having a sweetness to a burger is weird to me. * Beach house burger - This was a good burger.  I originally wanted to order this but my wife said she was getting it so I had to order a different one.  From the bite that she gave me I could tell that it was very good.  All the ingredients seemed to work together on this one. * Sweet potato tots - These were excellent.  The only thing that would have made them better is some type of aioli. * Seasoned fries - Very good - They were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The people here are what really stand out in my mind about this place.  The owner and all the other workers were very friendly and passionate about their restaurant.  I can't wait to return to try about 17 other things on their menu that look good."}
{"text":"I came across this place under Yelp's \"Hot New Businesses\" and was in the 'hood so thought I'd give it a try.  I came mid afternoon to avoid the lunch rush and ordered the beach house burger with sweet potato tots.  The tots were great as I'm a fan of all things sweet potato,  The chips were ok, maybe just overshadowed by the glory of the tots.  I'd like an option to sub the tots for the chips at  reduced price, as my order (with a water) came to over $10.  The burger was good, the toasted bun maybe could have been a little less....toasted.... as that flavor sort of overpowered everything else.  It was good overall, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back unless I had some other reason to be in the area."}
{"text":"Found out this place is one of the top 10 burgers in Phoenix, so of course my BF wanted to check it out. I don't eat red meat and he noticed they had a few veggie options too.  The place is small and \"divish\" and we had trouble finding a seat but once we ordered we were able to move to a bigger table. He had a burger with bacon, egg and cheese on a brioche bun. He said it was a very good burger, just wished it was a little bigger (he's 6'10\"). I had the pulled veggie sandwich and oh my! They smoked the vegetables and had a tangy bbq sauce that pulled all the flavors together. They also have French toast fries which we regretted not ordering, but will definitely get them next time."}
{"text":"I had their pulled pork sandwich, which was good. It wasn't anything out of the ordinary. We went around lunch time, it felt very cramped between the people and the tiny tables. You wouldn't even know it was there it was so tiny. But the s andwhich was good."}
{"text":"I had higher expectations for this place based on the reviews.  My son had a burger that was huge and he enjoyed it.  He was excited most about the marinated onions on it.  He usually hates onions and really enjoyed them that way.  I didn't think the chips were that great.  My girls got the kids meal chicken strips.  They came out looking hand made but burned.  The employee was kind enough to get us a second order but the kids still didn't like them.  I had the egg sandwich and thought it was just okay.  They forgot to put any cheese on it.  I missed that but it still didn't excite me.  They did have yoo hoo and the girls were happy about that.  OH and I saw a maple bacon milkshake on the menu.  LOL!  Ick!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this burger joint! Sweet potato tots are on point! I always go with the bacon cheeseburger and I'm never disappointed!"}
{"text":"I read all the reviews on Yelp and planned to head over tonight. We certainly were not disappointed as everything we had was every bit as good or better than all the rave reviews. Lots of special touches and each item was delicious. We had the burger, pulled pork, and toasted cheese along with some sides.  The owner and employees were friendly and gave impeccable service.  I have definitely added this place to my list of \"go to\" restaurants. Yes it's in a strip mall and casual!  Perfect for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Not your normal kind of burger spot. Different and unique. Great little spot for something new but want a burger. Fries are really good too. I'll be back soon to try their other burgers!"}
{"text":"My new favorite burger! I've been lucky enough to sample a few menu items:  Brûlée burger: juicy burger with melted havarti cheese, the best pickled red onions, a sugar brûlée'd bun, and a perfectly cooked egg with a runny yolk on top. This one is my favorite, but it is rich.   Fries: delicious. Totally worth it. Try them with their \"ranch\" (I have no idea what's in it but it's also quite super)  Country Fried burger: had this on my birthday, I had been waiting to try it. It was really tasty, 2 \"country fried\" patties, cheese, tomato, gravy, and crispy fried onions. This burger is also super tasty, but not at all what I was expecting. The patties weren't as crunchy as I expected, but it was still really good.   Paradise burger: my husband ordered this one but shared a few bites with me. The chile and pico packs a punch if you're sensitive to spice, if you're not sensitive it is packed with flavor and the pico adds some nice freshness. Would definitely do business with this burger again.   French toast fries: perfectly crunchy and sweet, served with syrup for dipping.   Lucky Charms Shake: shut up and take my money. It's awesome, and definitely not TOO sweet, which I was worried about.   Overall, this is my favorite go to burger spot in the valley. It's affordable, laid back, and delicious. If they served alcohol I probably wouldn't ever leave."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for a burger. Always busy, but not overly so where you can't get a table. The fries have this seasoning that's almost sweet. To die for! Burgers are great. They make their own ranch and pickled onions. They really pay attention to detail.   It's location in a sketchy stip mall, but there is a hidden Gem inside. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"AMAZING hole in the wall! I got the pulled pork, which itself was delicious but the toasted 9 grain bread really made the sandwich perfect. And the prices were more than reasonable, especially with how much food you get, they really don't skimp. My friend got the chicken club which was definitely a step above for such a classic sandwich. Definitely going back to try their sides next time!"}
{"text":"What a gem! Seriously. This place is near and dear to my heart. If this place would've been open when I went to high school across the street I think I would've wound up super fat.  I get the brûlée burger, with a mushroom, and it is amazing every time. The BBQ chips have a lot of flavor and keep me coming back for more every time. Their shakes are super decadent also.   One day, I won't be such a puss and will try some of their crazy specials."}
{"text":"Amazing crazy burgers!!! Brûlée burger was crazy good! My daughter loved the peanut butter milkshake !  Even my picky son liked the grilled cheese. French toast fries would have been better as dessert though. We will be back when in town again!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, reasonable prices, friendly service and no fuss.  Why hadn't we been here before?  Easy access in an iffy-looking strip mall conveniently located by the drive-thru liquor store.  But don't let the neighborhood deter you.  In a trendier spot with chic waitstaff you'd easily be paying twice as much for these designer burgers.  We need to go back soon to try the sandwiches and tacos, but it will be hard to not order the Beach Burger again.  Yum."}
{"text":"I had the Beach Burger which was delicious. The service was a bit slow but it was lunch time after all. The quality of ingredients was excellent and I will eat here again. Oh, they have really good fries! Crispy without being hard... YUMMM"}
{"text":"Came to Phoenix for a job interview and saw that this had Super high ratings. I didn't realize that this place had been on the food network until I got here so that's pretty cool! Michael recommended the brûlée burger and sweet potato fries so I got that! The burger was soooo good!!! Definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had! I feel like if I loved sweet potatoes as much as other people I'd have really liked the tots but I realized that I'm not a huge fan of sweet potatoes haha! But the atmosphere is great, the people is great, and the food is great! Definitely coming back if I ever come back to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"An amazing, unassuming little place - completely unexpected, and didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Paradise burger was fairly close to home so we thought ,why not. Manly men running the place so I figured it's got to be real food. WRONG  ! Pre formed ,cheap tasting meat with frilly pickled onions ,avocado  and burnt black green chili! The fries some of which were up to 4 inches long,were very well cooked ,but most were 1 inch or less ,bottom of the barrel .  Bun was similar to a ciabatta style ,smeared with a nondescript mayo based sauce that was not like anything I would knowingly eat again. These youngsters acted like they were serving prime meat,and the prices reflected it.  My wife's regular cheeseburger came with 3 slices of cucumber under a bunch of pickled red onion! CUCUMBER. On a burger? These guys are trying to be different and are coming off as weird."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, visiting from CA, and I had voted for Mexican food, but was vetoed by my burger loving compatriots. We found Paradise and it was indeed: tacos AND burgers were on the menu.  I had the pork tacos, competition style and they had sloppy joe patty melts and a bacon cheeseburger. The fries had a tasty seasoning on them as well!"}
{"text":"Great burgers I had the Brulée burger it was the very good, I would add another patty for a buck if your a big eater, the Beachhouse burger protein style was also very tasty according to the other diner. Tried the sweet potatoe tots & they are very good too. Very good ingredients used like brioche buns the pickled onions are great with egg on the Brulée burger!  My only gripe is, They need to hire a bus person to clean outside tables up and help inside also to clean up along the way,& clean the outside trash can and pick up baskets. You guys need pay attention to those cleaning details or your turn folks off even with such great food!"}
{"text":"Delish! Brulee' burger is amazing. Shakes bring a tear to my eye. Excellent people and service."}
{"text":"Paradise Valley Burger is the place that you escape from when you say to yourself, 'Self, today I am NOT paying attention to any diet! Nor counting any of those lame things called calories or fat.. Today this is all about my tastebuds and satisfying my WANT! Self you deserve this amazing moment of pure culinary tastebud goodness and why NOT?!' Now. There are also some awesome things on the menu here like salads, should a calorie or fat conscious person be joining in your selfish feast for the ages. But let's get to the burgers because after all, that's what the namesake is all about. I became an instant burger person when we walked in and got a very warm welcome and handed a menu. The place is small and jam packed full of obvious PV Burger login' lipsmacking people.. yes, it's crowded and it's a no frills kind of place. I can dig it.. I looked the menu up, down and again backwards, forwards. It was hard to decide! There are so many options for burgers; sandwiches; tacos and like I said , those things called ,'salads'. Not today, healthy, NOT today. I actually witnessed one salad of healthy go by and it looked packed full of fresh ingredients and a tad of guilt came over me for my lack of care on my summer bod..yes. Just a little, BUT, not enough for me to go there on this a BURGER day!  I got the PV Cheese Burger with Bacon! So basic, but that's me. You know, a basic one. This 1/4 lb. of lean beef between a fresh brioche bun comes loaded with fixin's that you can choose and a sauce , they recommend the 1000 Island ...but the Jalepeno Ranch sounds tasty too!. I went with the 1000 Island  and it made the burger even more delish than it already was. The pickeled onions are different but good! My husband and I split the Cardinal Fries: why not ? My heart can handle just a little more today! Fries smothered in sauce ; jalapeños; pulled pork .. OMG! They are good and rich and seriously share these! Like the burger, they are messy!  I walked out of here so full the guilt I had from this pleasure overload was too much! PV Burger is a tasty find and I can see why it was on Diners Drive In's and Dives.. Guy Fieri usually knows good hidden places. Paradise Valley  Burger I'll be back someday for more adventures in your burgers .. to the rest of you , this is a local place too good not to try!"}
{"text":"Drove in from Los Angeles and tried the Brûlée burger, the Cubano, and the BeachHouse Burger they were off the hook. The best burger I have ever eaten.  If you like a great burger this is a must try."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great burgers at great prices. Very fresh & tasty.  Good French fries too.  Fun place & good food. Thanks."}
{"text":"Amending my previous review.  Love their burgers so when my in laws were in town, we took them and the kids out to eat here. Tiny restaurant, 100 degrees inside, bland burger tonight,  but that's ok. What made me upset was horrible customer service.  The wobbly table got knocked, and my kindergartener's water bottle spilled (ever hear of cups with lids?)  Well my husband said he would clean it up and then some old guy who worked there said \"shit\" and left to get a mop.  When I was returning from the bathroom wth my toddler, he just about ran her over in anger.    I left without finishing.  I understand if your restaurant is tiny and you don't have adequate seating, but no need to have an attitude with your customers!   I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I had lunch here earlier today for the first time, and its all I have been thinking about all day! WOW delicious burgers i guarantee you wont find anywhere else for the price. So many awesome random menu items. Totally unique. My new favorite burger place. You must try the fries as they come (seasoned in 16 different things) and their fried onions are good enough to order as your side"}
{"text":"Not in our regular neighborhood but took a chance and it was amazing. Had the Booze Burger protein style and I was actually able to pick it up and eat it like a regular burger!! Sweet potato tots rocked. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"ENVIRONMENT  Small shop in a strip mall with indoor seating, including bar seating and a few outdoor tables. The place was packed when we visited, which is a good sign  MENU Lots of unique offerings and combinations. Brûlée burger, jalapeño ranch, Lucky Charms Marshmallow milkshake.  BURGER Beach House - amazing burger with poco de gallo and some kick  MILKSHAKE Lucky Charm Milkshake - WHOA! The lucky charms marshmallows are ground in just as you would expect, but the shake itself tastes of homemade ice cream, which is awesome.    GRILLED CHEESE Havarti - Excellent  SIDES  French Toast Fries -- COULD BE THE BEST THING ON THE MENU"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Get the fries, they are the best. Good and friendly service. You won't regret it."}

{"text":"I just realized I had another fantastic burger here today and have never taken the time to review them on Yelp. This place has got fantastic food, friendly staff and a nice atmosphere. Nothing special about the interior but the quality and quantity of food more than makes up for the lack of things to look at while you're eating. I have not had anything here burger wise that I did not think was fantastic and the other sandwiches are excellent as well. For freshly made food they get your order in and the food out pretty quickly. No complaints about anything."}
{"text":"Just ate at PV Burger Co for the first time and loved it. Eclectic burgers perfectly cooked and the sweet potato tater tots were delicious.  Our new burger spot."}
{"text":"I received a message from the owner right after I posted my review. He had great things so say on how my issues would be dealt with immediately, and he thanked me for my honest review. I will be going back to PVBC again, the food is too good and I appreciate the owner's professional response to my review!"}
{"text":"Had no idea this place was on Diners Drive ins and dives until we ordered!  It certainly did not disappoint! Ordered the bacon cheeseburger.  Excellent!  Friendly service easy to find and of course great food!  Will definitely be back to this one!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed with the food  owner and staff very friendly a must try the burger brûlée you won't disappointed I am almost done with the entire menu"}
{"text":"Good burgers. Place it's small but food was all good. French Toast fries were the bomb. What a genius idea"}
{"text":"PVBC is far and away one of the most famous burger joints in the Valley. The Burger Guy came here buddies for lunch, and I think it was everybody's first time there. If PVBC is known for one thing it is their crazy burger concoctions. I believe they come up with a new special burger of the week (or is it \"of the month\"). They also set themselves apart by opting for tator tots as the offered potato-based accompaniment as opposed to french fries. But the Burger Guy reviews, you guessed it, burgers!  The Burger - 7.5 (out of 10) So is Paradise Valley Burger Company overrated?... Yeah, probably. This place is known as one of, if not thee best, burger places in town. I can think of three in Tempe alone that are better. The Burger Guy ordered the Brulee Burger, as it seemed likely it would hit the flavor notes I was looking for. Two of my buddies ordered the Beach Burger, which I also got to try. The bun was definitely the best part of the Burger. Super soft Brioche-style, it didn't hold up actually. But it was a delicious pillow and that burger was a mess (it had egg) so I won't hold that against it. So why doesn't the Burger Guy LOVE the burger here? Well, the fact I was holding it together for dear life didn't score it any points. But the real failure here... the beef was bland. I can't say if it's the griddle, the grind, or the seasoning, but the burger just didn't \"sing\".

{"text":"Start your review: yes, Yum!!!   So we decided (my husband and I) to try the restaurant. About a few weeks ago, we watched the triple D episode that featured three restaurants in AZ, this was one of them. So I bookmarked the restaurants and although we wanted to try Paradise Valley Burger Co earlier, we didn't go until yest coz it's kinda far away from home. This time however, we had an appointment around that area so we decided to go.   All I could say is wow! I'm so glad I watched the episode cause if it wasn't for triple D, I wouldn't think of trying this place! It's a small restaurant in a small shopping center. The sign is just plain, the whole look of the restaurant is so simple, to me it looked like a cafeteria (nothing against cafeteria looks but I don't usually go to small places unless they were recommended).  We went in, looked at the menu and decided to order the Country Fried burger which to my surprise had gravy served with it but not a pork based one! Yes!! I get to try gravy. We also ordered fries and drinks. Prices are average. For 2 burgers, 2 fries and one drink & water, we paid around $22, not a bad deal. A few min later the food comes out. Looking good! I love fried onions too. I pour some of the gravy on my burger and take my first bite, OMG! This is so gooood! The gravy is great and it has a hint of spice, whoever came up with its recipe is a super star!  This is a burger one should definitely have, over and over again! I think I'll have to move closer to north Scottsdale now. Way to go guys. Really, a job well done!"}
{"text":"Never judge a book by its cover, I walked in & thought to myself this is just another me too burger joint.  I was wrong, the service was amazingly fast & friendly, the burger & fries was amazing.  I was really amazed, ill be back"}
{"text":"Seriously the best food ever! Also the people who work there are so nice. Only thing I don't like are the prices but oh well."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The burgers are so good! I come here at least every other week and the burger of the week ideas have been nothing short of amazing"}
{"text":"Great meal (pulled pork with fries).I can just recommended. We were there as a group of seven and all the people were satisfied."}

{"text":"I feel I haven't reviewed you guys yet best burger place in Arizona hands down. I met the owner cool dude awesome service and they always keep that fire going with new burgers I like that worth the drive and damn good"}
{"text":"A great spot for super fun burgers with awesome and interesting combos. I came in last week and had the special which was a bacon infused burger on two grilled cheese sandwiches for buns, served with tomato bisque. Soooo good! Seriously every bite is amazing, this place is an absolute gem. I was also here in April and tried the 420 burger, which included lucky charms in the deep fried burger and served with Funyuns on it, amazing!   Everything they serve is thoughtful and adds to the awesome flavors that are going on in their burgers.   The service is quick and friendly and the atmosphere is really relaxed. Both times that I've been here it's been a great experience. The prices are super reasonable as well.   All around a fantastic spot for a fun, delicious burger!"}
{"text":"Yeah. This place rocks. Super busy but they work hard and pull the service off professionally. Had the brûlée burger. YUM. Perfection. The owner was bussing tables and delivering food. He stopped to chat. What a great guy. Just the kind of nice human being that you want to root for. Definitely going back soon to try some of their other creations."}
{"text":"I was seeing a movie across the street and decided to try out the Paradise Valley Burger Company.  It is located in a strip mall across the street (southeast side) from the hospital.  The restaurant is small and has a homey atmosphere.  I went around lunch time and it was full.  I ordered my son the kid's meal that comes with chicken fingers and fries.  Unfortunately the chicken fingers were burnt and I had to send them back for edible ones.  The replacement ones were overcooked, dry and had little taste.  The fries were standard.  My wife ordered the Caesar salad that consisted of a mayonnaise based dressing that tasted horrible.  Finally, I had soft shell tacos that were good, not great.  The prices are reasonable, but I have yet to find a reason to return."}
{"text":"What a simply amazing, unique experience!  For my first visit, I let the cashier guide me to their signature burger -- the burger Brulée.  Check out the menu for the ingredients, which sound crazy, but the result is just stunning.  You've never had anything like it.    The house BBQ chips are excellent.  I'm not a fan of commercial BBQ chips as they basically just taste like salt, sugar, and fake smoke.  These are perfectly crisp, with a hint of sweet/salt, and a very light hint of BBQ flavor.  You still taste mostly crispy potato, which is great.  For my second visit I went with a burger of the day that had Korean pork on top, with a few other ingredients, and beer-battered burger patties.  Again, a crazy combo that was simply fantastic.  The wife had their grilled cheese with bacon, also exceptional."}
{"text":"Amazing place. My wife and I came here are watching it be featured on DDD. It did not disappoint.   We each had a burger. I had the country fried Bruges. Amazing! My wife had the green chili sauces burger. Amazing!!  The tots were top notch. Service was excellent. This place is in a strip mall but don't let that discourage you from coming. We have been back 3 times in the last 3 weeks and always consistently amazing!!"}
{"text":"This place is so good and they dont need to advertise since they are such a good quality burger shop that cares about taste and their customers."}
{"text":"First time visiting PV Burger Company- and it did not disappoint! Excellent food and friendly service. I'm a vegetarian but my husband is not. I had the pulled vegetarian (made with smoked cabbage) and my husband had the Demon burger, Seasoned fries, and the Jalapeño fries. We were both really impressed. As a vegetarian the vegetarian options are usually meh, so I was thrilled with the options and can't say enough good things about the pulled vegetarian. It was fabulous. The Demon burger had a bunch of peppers like pickled Serrano in tequila, chili pesto, beer battered poblano, and chipotle bacon. It was not spicy, but was delicThe entire menu is unique and our meals were both full of flavor. We don't live close by, but whenever we are in the Paradise Valley area around lunchtime we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Just Awesome! Love the thin sliced cucumbers on the burgers. Everything is fresh and the service is top notch"}
{"text":"Bret, the owner, contacted me almost immediately after I posted my review. He immediately owned the situation, and explained the challenges he faced arranging logistics with the Dbacks. Since, he's been on site overseeing the logistics and ensuring great service.  Though the initial experience was not good, Bret did an amazing job dealing with a situation partly out of his control. Also, to be clear, his food is no doubt 5 star worthy, as is his main location on Bell and 40th."}

{"text":"I've got two tickets to Paradise... Valley Burger Company! Is it Shangri-la? Not quite, but the burgers sure are heavenly. The creative menu, divey ambiance, and personable management/staff, make this place a great lunch or dinner option. Especially if you've got meat on your mind.  Celebrating Jennifer [100]O's review UYE (see what I did there?), where else would we go other than a Yelp-approved burger joint. Several other fantastic Yelpers showed up to make this live-review event a momentous occasion. Well, momentous compared to your average review!   I ordered the Burger Brulee and split a side of seasoned fries. This burger was really flavorful, with a fine mix of savory and sweet. It's loaded up with a fried egg, bacon, onion, burnt sugar and havarti cheese. The fried egg will undoubtedly break apart, mix up with the ingredients, and drip a tantalizing sauce for you to dab up with fries (pro tip). I highly recommend it!   The restaurant, itself, isn't much to write home about, but you don't need fancy digs to grill up amazing burger creations.   In the future, I want to come back and check out the Beach House Burger. A recent Phoenix New Times \"Burger Battle\" pits it up against Hopdoddy (which I love), and winning!  http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2014/07/hamburger_phoenix_hopdaddy_vs_paradise_valley_burger_co.php"}
{"text":"Our first visit here was outstanding.  The clerk asked if we had been there before and filled us in on the favorites.  The burgers were outstanding.  We will definitely go back.. The fries were very interesting.  They were seasoned and had a bit of a sweet taste to the spice.  Love IT!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Texas BBQ Burger w/ sweet potato tots and it was out of this world! The menu in its entirety looked amazing. Kept looking at what everyone else ordered and wishing I had room to get what they had. Great place!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a pick up order. Total time was about 10 minutes Good burger and fries. The staff was a little cold not friendly at all. Over all it was ok not a great experience."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Diners Drive-ins and dives thought we'd give it a try.... So far Lil hole in the wall place, guy taking our order not very friendly... Presentation great... Now for taste... Frank is giving it two thumbs up!"}

{"text":"How far would you drive for a burger? How far would you drive for a great burger? This is an important consideration because there are so many places in the valley serving better burgers than you can find in any chain.  In my opinion, the 18 mile drive to Paradise Valley Burger is negligible because I now understand why people are talking about it. I saw the DDD episode but didn't pay much attention. Then a co-worker mentioned PV Burger after a disappointing visit to another burger boutique.  Despite recent experiences elsewhere, I've enjoyed some pretty good burgers. PV Burger does not serve \"pretty good\" burgers. Last night, when looking for dinner options, Yelp! indicated that PV Burger was in the area. Done!  I was greeted by Kailee (sp ?) who realized i was not familiar with the menu. She did a great job explaining everything, from the weekly specials to the fry seasoning. Wow! I found a burger joint that offers service... That's an item that has been sorely lacking.  When in Rome, try the weekly special. I just discovered my new favorite burger! It's called the Dr. Jesus Green Eggs & Ham. Sadly, it'll be gone next week. No matter, this burger is an accurate representation of how this joint elevates the burger.  My burger had two patties, a slice of chipotle ham, queso fresca, cabbage, a creamy verde salsa, a fried egg, and cilantro on a nicely toasted bun. Seriously, just the bun alone is worth talking about. And cabbage!? Are you kidding me?! What a great idea! Put it all together and you have a very unique combination of flavors that you can't get enough of. And the fries were cooked fresh to order. Great seasoning here too!  Remember, if you want a burger, there's probably a McDonalds within a few miles of where you live. If you want a burger that you will never forget, now you know where to go."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and I am truly amazed at all of the over the top positive reviews. But let's get past the hype and into the details.   I have had the pulled pork and it was just Meh for me, I had the sloppy joe and it was awful. I told the owner it was awful and he was a stand-up guy and gracious enough to replace it with the pulled pork.  Thinking recently that I was missing the boat, I ordered a Cheeseburger with fries and a soda for $9.24. There are no refills on sodas. This is probably designed to keep the nearby high school kids from loitering all afternoon after school. The burger tasted like it was cooked in the morning and reheated. It had a char taste to it but quite frankly I have had better burgers at Burger King. The fries were way over seasoned and did not taste good and were thrown away.  So I feel like I can go to Whataburger down the street and get a much better tasting burger, fries and free refills for a lesser price."}
{"text":"These guys have the best burger in phx with some creative genius in the kith em coming up with unique food combinations that just work some how before you order check what the special is !!!!"}
{"text":"Really really wanted to live this place but burgers were both sub par for a specialty burger place. I got the country fried and my wife got a cheeseburger. Both were smaller than I expected, beef was slightly over cooked, and the worst part was the cheese on the cheeseburger was only melted around the edges. A cardinal sin.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is legit!  If you are having a craving for a delicious burger you should check it out for sure. All sort of interesting burgers and specials.  I imagine they are busy for lunch but it has never been crowded for dinner.  Try the sweet potato tots. Super good."}
{"text":"Paradise Valley Burger Is by far the best burger spot in AZ! There is nobody that compare to these flavors that punch your pallet lol if that makes sense! They have a special burger weekly to keep you coming back!  these burgers you can't pass up! Once you take one bite of one of there burgers. You will be a lifelong customer! Guaranteed! :)"}
{"text":"My hubby is always on the lookout for a good burger.  This place is definitely unique.  They have some burgers you will not find elsewhere!  Such as....the  Brûlée burger which has bacon, a fried egg, pickled onion and you guessed it...a sugary bruleed bun.  Unlike anything I've ever tried before!  My husband had the Booze Burger which was also very unique.  Seasoned fries are delicious.  This place was featured on DDD.  Staff was all super friendly."}
{"text":"Good music, Rage, Sublime, Bob Marley, &c.  It took a little while to get our food.  I ordered the Booze Burger and a side of Fries.  It was definitely unique.  I was surprised by the sweetness of the peppers and even the seasoning on the fries was sweet.  Usually when I go for a burger I'm thinking savory so it was a surprise.  It was good, just different."}

The guy at the counter seemed nice and helpful...at first. As we sat there and watched others come in, he looked like he was bored and counting down the minutes til they could close up. He and the 2 other guys I saw there seemed like the typical fraternity Bros...ready to start their cinco de mayo festivities instead of interacting with customers. We both had the burger with bacon and cheese. It was good...at first...then super salty. Fries were ok. Just not really impressed at all. Guess I should've stuck with my FIVE GUYS."}
{"text":"Great burger joint.  The burgers themselves are the stars.  Good-sized patty not overcooked.  Bun on the thinner side which makes make for perfect bun-meat-extras ratio.  Quality toppings.  Five stars for the burgers.  Fries (4 stars) were very good.  Sweet potato tots (3 stars) not so much - too mushy and oily.  Service was very conscientious.  Space is small and not a place to linger at lunchtime. Wish the soda fountain was bottomless self-serve  (it's not) - and you're looking at about $12 for a burger/fries/drink served in a plastic basket - so it ain't dirt cheap.  Nonetheless - a fun indulgence.    Oh - and the same ownership has taken control of the pizza place a few doors down - they passed around some samples today - not bad!"}

{"text":"We used postmates to have this place delivered, and I am glad we did!  The burgers were great! The buns are so fresh, burger meat was delicious, and the fries are incredible! They use some great seasonings.  Bacon burger is great and my fiancé had the burger with Country gravy.  Only negative was that there wasn't enough gravy, and they did not listen to our requests for condiments.  I'm sure if we went in it would have been different tho.  With great prices, I would recommend this place for a great burger, especially over fast food."}

Do yourself a favor and make a trip to this joint as it's well worth the trip!! Be sure and try the Brulee Burger and wash it down with a Lucky Charms Milkshake!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years and never ordered something I didn't like. I strongly recommend the Booze Burger, and their shakes are always a great choice. In addition, if you go when things aren't packed, have a chat with the owner Brett. A few minutes talking to him about his restaurant,  his cooking, and his passion will make it clear why his burgers stand out."}
{"text":"We ordered the Sloppy Joe, Cheeseburger, regular fries and french toast fries.  Everything was excellent.  We have been trying to find a local burger place that isn't a chain and this was everything we hoped for including being a \"hole-in-the-wall.\"  Some of the best places are hidden gems, and this would be one of them.   The burger was cooked to order, the regular fries were perfect, the Sloppy Joe was our \"wildcard\" order and it was surprisingly delicious - add to that the french toast fries and it was like having a dessert with our lunch.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Great burger and sandwiches. Fries have a lot of seasoning but it is a good sweet/salty seasoning. Fast services and lots of menu options."}

Then given a table and menus but not told we needed to order at the counter, so we waited for a while until we realized no one was serving at the tables.  Burgers were good, but the service was slow and the server had an attitude.  There was a man busing the tables and he continued to stand around our table with a dirty wet rag dangling in our faces for over 10 minutes.  Then he sat down and continued to stare at us.  We first thought he was doing that so we would leave and free up a table, but there were several empty tables at the time.  All of our party noticed his behavior and didn't like it.  If surly service and a less than clean dining room was done to add to the \"Dive\" atmosphere then they succeeded.  None of our party will be back."}
{"text":"First time there. Nothing special about establishment, but it was clean.  Service- the cashier made some suggestions on the menu and was courteous.  I got the paradise burger with the addition of bacon and cheese.  Everything looked freshly cooked (beef and bacon).  The veggies looked fresh, and the cheese seemed like a thick slice cut from an actual block of cheese - not some imitation cheese-spread crap.  This $7 burger was well worth it based on the freshness of ingredients.  As for taste...well it tasted great.  I probably could have made just as good of burger on the grill at home with the same ingredients, but this was made for me in less than 10 minutes without the hassle.  I'll take it.  I only got a coke to go with it, so can't comment on any of the sides."}
{"text":"I found out about PVBC from a friend who posted the weekly special on Facebook. A double patty topped with jalapeno, bacon, bbq sauce, blueberry cream, and corn bread crumbles! I was intrigued by the unique combination of ingredients and had to have it ASAP! It did not disappoint! I also ordered a side of seasoned fries and a Lucky Charms shake. The fries were good nothing to brag about. The shake was amazeballs. I like that they're not stingy with condiments. They have a free for all supply of their house sauce in the soda pop refrigerator perfect for your fries or burger. I'll be back before I start my diet next week!"}
{"text":"great burgers - kinda pricey, but this ain't McDonalds!"}
{"text":"The owner is the nicest guy you'll ever meet. He is so good to his customers and is overall an awesome guy. The food is absolutely incredible and beyond my expectation. The staff is wonderful and so friendly, you can tell they love working here. I will for sure be coming back. I recommend this to anyone who loves good food, awesome service, and supporting local thriving businesses!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I have now tried their beach house burger as well as the brulee burger. Opposite ends of the taste spectrum but both were exceptionally well made. The tots surprised me being made of sweet potatoes, but were well worth eating. The strawberry shake was a work of art. Counter service only, but friendly and helpfull. And all this for around the same price as a meal at the Burger King accross the parking lot."}
{"text":"AVERAGE AT BEST. I read all of the positive reviews and was looking forward to having a good burger. I even brought some friends to check it out. The first impression was not good, as it is located next to a busy liquor store with shady people hanging around outside. No big deal, I thought, it's probably a delicious hole-in-the-wall... NOT!  The first problem was when I ordered. I ordered two sandwiches and two sides, I asked the cashier if he wanted to know which burger went with which side and he said no, the sides come separately. Guess what? NOPE. Each burger had its own side and they put the wrong sides with the wrong burgers. When we told the server who brought out the food, he said \"oh that's not a big deal\". Well, it kind of was to us because we had multiple orders all of which were screwed up. So we were all reaching across to other people's orders to eat our side dishes. The server should have apologized and offered to make it right, but instead he brushed it off and made it our problem.  Next was the quality of the burgers. Several in my group joked that we should have just gone to the Burger King on the corner. I would have to agree. Our burgers were TINY. Two in my party ordered the chicken fried steak burger. The gravy was completely flavorless and thin like water. Both who ordered said their burgers were \"gross and flavorless\". My bacon cheeseburger was below average. The buns they use flatten quickly and get soggy, leaving you with a mess that you can barely eat with your hands. Nobody wants to hold a thin, soggy bun.  My friend ordered some tacos, I couldn't believe what they brought out. A smattering of meat covered with some chopped tomatoes and shredded cheese out of a bag. No salsa, or sauce, or anything. They were completely dry! I told my friend not to order tacos at a burger place, but you would hope that if they put it on the menu they would at least know how to make a decent taco. IN ARIZONA!  I tried hard to like this place, but with so many better options out there I cannot recommend this place. I suppose if you're desperate or dying of hunger, it might work. But if you're looking for a good burger experience, run away from this place and don't look back. Even Carl's Jr makes a much better burger.  Beware of the positive reviews here. I think too many folks are vulnerable to \"group think\" or try far too hard to like a place that they think they should like - because it was featured on Food Network or something - and then forgive that which is truly unforgivable. Save yourself time, money, and frustration and go to The Habit."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times. On the first visit I chose the standard House Cheeseburger & seasoned fries... I haven't tried anything else on my subsequent visits only because I've found myself still craving my first experience. This place is legit"}
{"text":"The burgers are really good, fresh and a great size. However, I come here for the tacos. Weird? Wait until you taste them. I usually get the Fresno style or the competition style. They are the perfect size with tasty meats, but it's the toppings that make them unforgettable. I know it's a burger place, but try the tacos, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"It was good burgers and has a great old fashion flare and taste, made fresh with all fresh ingredients but they are small and overpriced for what you get..  Service was ok.. To many amazing burger places are popping up and the evolution of burgers they remind us that sometimes simple is good.."}
{"text":"The food was eaten too fast to take a photo. The Brûlée burger was like SpongeBob to a Krabby Patty, addictive. Buns were so delicious, perfect size burger, not crazy huge. Highly recommend! We got there before lunch, still pretty busy."}
{"text":"Brûlée burger or booze burger ! Why is life so difficult ? Opted for the former , did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Our burgers and shake were great, however the potatoe chips were over cooked and the fries were to salty.  For the price I would have expected the staff to be dressed in better then super short holey cutoff shorts and a string tank top. Cleanliness was also a factor, we cleaned off our table an wiped it down. After seeing the bus boy make swipes at the tables with the same cloth he had in his hand that he used to open the trash can! I am thankful we had cleaned our own table!"}
{"text":"Small little place but the burgers pack a punch! Creative options with the traditional options as well. With a variety of options and rotating chef's menu, there's always something that'll fit your palette."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, and found Paradise Valley Burger to be a consistent 4-star experience.  For a burger joint, the food ranks between a 4 to 5 star. They offer a huge assortment of toppings for the burgers, chicken sandwiches and portabello mushroom sandwich.  I have enjoyed the Paradise Bacon Cheeseburger, and have stolen a few bites of my dining companion's food as well. The Country Fried Burger is a decadent as it sounds- country fried, smothered in gravy with crispy fried onions- no, I didn't order it, but I sure did sneak a taste!  And while I don't understand ordering a chicken sandwich at a burger joint, I did get to sample a bit of a chicken sandwich, and it was flavorful and juicy, very hot and fresh off the grill.  The sides are good as well- sweet potato tater tots were another item I personally did not order but stole a few before they quickly disappeared.   Service time was inconsistent, rating it a 3 to 4 star. Seems when they get a full house, output noticeably slows. If I was in a hurry to get back to an office, I might find this a dealbreaker. But maybe people coming from a work site could phone in an order so it's ready when they arrive.   Also, they have fresh brewed Iced Tea. They have a bunch of sodas in a cooler case, but since I am not a soda drinker, I cannot give you much more info on that.  Now of course I COULD point out that they are making your food fresh and that does take a little more time. Well, guess I just pointed that fact out. Still, if there's one thing that PV Burger Co. might work on, it would be workflow / consistent timing of orders during particularly busy hours.  Casual/comfortable indoor environment, good place to meet up w/ friends, or grab a quick bite by yourself even. Definitely on the \"Yes\" list of places for a return visit"}
{"text":"The Brûlée burger is the best burger I've had in a while. Two patties, bacon, havarti, sweet onions and a brioche bun that's sweet and crunchy from the cooked sugar... Fantastic. Will be back to try others."}
{"text":"Amazing flavor & diverse menu options. Who wouldn't want french toast fries as a side to their burger? Healthy options don't lack in flavor either! The guy at the front is really nice. Glad we found this spot!!"}
{"text":"Lived close to this place my whole life and just recently started eating there. Best decision ever, the Texas burger is my fave. It's so good! I recommend this place to anyone visiting or who likes a good burger. Good service, fries, and shakes are just part of the package deal."}
{"text":"Great burger and delicious seasoned fries! The staff was super helpful and very friendly."}
{"text":"Came in here with my family we all ordered different burgers and we all loved them. The burgers are juicy,  flavorful and have a nice smoky flavor. The fries and sweet potato tots are delicious. Great service and great food. Even the malts and milkshakes are amazing. Must try the maple pecan bacon malt."}
{"text":"The creativity of this ambitious menu helps PV Burger stand out in the difficult terrain between the fast food and gourmet burger price point. A slight upgrade in their ingredients and this place will quickly outgrow the strip mall in which it resides and move to the upper echelon of the Phoenix burger scene."}
{"text":"I like the place, but it would be better if they had grain bread choices and hot peppers, the homemade chips are really great."}
{"text":"Saw the DDD episode while channel surfing and decided to try out PVBC.  Glad i did. The place is a little divey, but that is okay with me if the food is good, and the food was! Had the brulee burger and it was excellent. My friend had the beach house burger and also liked it.  I especially liked the customer service. My friend was running late, so I was standing around waiting. One of the staff came up and asked if I needed anything while I was waiting, which was great!"}
{"text":"Paradise Valley burger is by far the worse burger shop I have ever been to. Asked for bacon on my burger and didn't even get that. Fries where ok as was shake but if looking for a good burger don't go here."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times.   Service was always excellent and the food isn't bad either!"}
{"text":"My first impression after eating here is that it is a little over-hyped. Maybe it was just my particular burger. Not sure. There is a definite sense of creativity in their menu and there is good amount of unique variations.         I ordered the weekly special which sounded pretty good (The Chipoodle: smoked mozzarella, chipotle aioli, candied bacon, and fried onions). The fried onions were awesome, the candied bacon was lost and only noticed in a few bites, and the aioli was on the slim side as well.) I also ordered the Sweet Potato Tater Tots but was less than impressed.          I didn't feel that anything I ate was over the top (flavor wise). I will come here and try something else since the menu is so promising. The Beach House looks pretty good.         My bill came out to over $12 for a burger, fries, and soda. For that I want something better than what the chains offer. I hate to say that I would have been happier with a Five Guys Burger. One more try may change my mind. We'll see."}
{"text":"If you are craving a smaller burger of slightly above average taste and witty composition, try this place out. Just make sure you're in a forgiving mood, because their service is really gonna test you. Rude and careless order taking, forgotten dishes, slow delivery, they'll throw it all at you. But, when your burger finally arrives with all its unique scrumptiousness, you might just forgive their insolence. Maybe.  Also, don't know if the order taker was under some influence, but when I asked for a water cup he handed me one full of ice with bite marks all around the rim. Didn't end up getting a drink.  2 1/2 stars would be more accurate."}
{"text":"The layout of this place is nice and simple. Food pictures on the wall made it helpful to choose what to eat on the menu.   Staff members were nice, welcoming, and helpful. So i would say good service.   Menu was small, but there is soo much you can do to customize your order. Thats what i liked about it.   Food was tasteful! Flavors were good! I was happy with my order.   I recommend this to people who love food and presentation and taste!   Would i eat here again? Hell yea!"}
{"text":"This brand-new, locally owned business in the food court of the Paradise valley Mall is a gem. The owner of this burger joint makes each creation fresh to order. The choices are tasty and you can customize your burger to whatever you want.  I ordered a cheeseburger with grilled onions, coleslaw, lettuce, and tomato. All fresh, tasty, and juicy. I highly recommend this place over some of the other chain burger places in the Valley."}
{"text":"Good burger and good prices. I would rather come here over a chain. A bit far from my house but a good stop if you're nearby."}
{"text":"Our adventurous selves found a quick googling of this place associated with Guy Fieri so we have it a go. If you're not getting a a burger skip this joint. The girlfriend ordered a chicken sandwich, it was pretty awful. Just poor quality chicken and built poorly. The staff was mediocre, seemed disinterested. I got a green chili burger and although greasy and messy. I loved it. I wouldn't do it on the regular but occasionally it's a fun little joint. Infant are a scrambled egg and he would give that 5stars as per usual with this kid.   Don't come with too many expectations and you'll do just fine."}
{"text":"Cheeseburger in Paradise   You cant judge a book by its cover.  The same can be said about Paradise Valley Burger Company, so don't let the strip mall fool you, these burgers are a little taste of paradise. So, if you're looking for a top notch, delicious, greasy burger, than Paradise Valley Burger is the the place for you.  Paradise Valley Burger is a small restaurant with indoor tables and a few additional tables outside on the sidewalk. The menu is on a grease board and changes daily with specials.    Everything at Paradise Valley Burger  is prepared to order.  You place your order, take a seat, and wait for your meal to be delivered. On this visit I ordered the cheeseburger with sweet potato tots.  The sweet potato tots were hot, crispy, seasoned perfectly, and very tasty, as was my burger.  You can't beat the price and quality of Paradise Valley Burger. If you haven't tried this place I highly recommend it and skip the national fast food chains. These burgers are delicious and the price is right."}
{"text":"Insane flavor!  Had the dimebag burger w/ Royal crown infused bbq, cheddar, coleslaw, all on texas toast.  Delicious!  Customer service here is always top notch and the variety of burgers is incomparable.  This is not your average burger joint, you can tell the chefs/owners put a lot of thought and creativity into each creation.  Very unassuming location but you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place changes the notion of a \"burger joint\". I've been to PVBC many times. I try to make it there at least once a week. Their burgers, sweet potato tots, and chicken club on 9 grain keep bringing me back. The food is well presented, well put together, and the flavor combinations are incredible.   Yesterday, however, I decided I was going to try something new and went for the weekly facebook special, the Texas BBQ Burger. Double chargrilled patties marinated in homemade BBQ sauce, roasted poblano, creamy slaw, smoked bacon, and freshly shaven smoked mozzarella. As I took the first bite, it happened: all other experiences I've had with burgers in my life faded to the distant background, and PVBC cemented itself as my definition of the PERFECT burger, flawless in taste, presentation, and overall execution.   And from now on, all burgers I will have anywhere else will only be cheap imitations of the products of divine work being done in this modest, unassuming kitchen. Part of me is just thinking of never eating another burger outside of PVBC.  OH YEAH. IT'S THAT F-ING GOOD. Do yourself a favor. Stop in. Order the brulee, the pulled pork, or my go-to, the chicken club. It wil change you, and then you'll have an idea of what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple times now and each time the food is outstanding. The guys working behind the counter are always friendly and if you follow their Facebook page you get sneak peaks of what new burger creation they are working on."}
{"text":"Stopped by after reading yelp reviews. Burger was amazing and so was the pulled pork!!  My wife and I shared the beach house burger which was delicious. Kids meals were perfect size and love the little touches they added!!!"}
{"text":"People make these comments waaaayyy too specific, the burgers here are awesome and the staff is friendly. They have this really great jalapeño sauce that I love to dip my fries in. I'd recommend trying it out and not focus on some of these negative comments"}
{"text":"Seriously the best burgers in the valley! I love PVBC. The service is prompt and the food is amazing. The fries are great, they come with a sweet and spicy seasoning which is delicious. I love the paradise bacon cheeseburger, the bacon is great quality. And the pickled onions are so yummy. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't want to support a place like this?! Local, small shop feel with great options & fabulous food. Skip the chains & head on over to this great spot."}
{"text":"Best burgers, best service, best food!! You want the bomb burger go here !! The service is really good the Brulé burger is the best."}
{"text":"Just ate the Brulee Burger and think it was a religious experience. This is my new favorite everyday spot! LOVE LOVE!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident while in Phoenix.  Hands down the best burger I have ever had.   The pickled onions and sliced cucumbers were a pleasant surprise.  Wish you had a location in Vegas!  Will be back for sure next time I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers, check. Super tasty fries, check. Tacos and a bunch of other fun stuff to try out? Check! This place is a HUGE leap up from In & Out which is our go-to for fast food burgers and makes the meal even more special. The line starts early and gets pretty long but the food is worth the wait. Check this place out.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great food with lots of creative burger options. Will definitely be going there again to eat."}
{"text":"During lunch hour the wait is a little long but goes by pretty fast! They have seating inside and outside. Keep in mind it's a little small but you won't care. Pictures of the burgers on the wall! They have also been on Diners Drive Inns and Dives. They bring out your food and call out your name! Laid back music like sublime, 311 type. I enjoy my visit every time! The guys that work here are absolutely wonderful! During a busy day they keep their cool and stay smiling!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Amazing and very unique Burgers. Hands down best burger in the Valley!"}
{"text":"The most amazing burger  ever! I'm sure everything is yummy here, but I can't seem to order anything but the burger brulee. It is beyond fantastic. Their sweet potato tots are great, as well."}
{"text":"I seldom dream about burgers but when I do, the Brûlée Burger is definitely one that comes to mind. Combining savory and sweet is often a daunting task because the result ends up with one of the two extremes dominating. It reminds me of those days I lay victim to endless handfuls of kettle corn popped fresh at a stand and the sweet smell paraded through the air like some jerk, \"Buy me! Eat me!\" The taste was and is still both salty and sweet and satisfying.        Well hello again friend. Except this time, you are disguised as an incredible rich tasting burger. Thank goodness I took pictures of you dear Brûlée Burger because I ate you all too quickly. Fried egg, bacon, onion, burned sugar, and havarti.. Ugh! Your buddies, the sweet potato tots, did their fare share of damage as well, since they too quickly disappeared in my tummy along with the chipotle ketchup!       My hubby ate a special called New Year's Burger, which was crazy spicy but delicious as well. How could you go wrong with a deep fried bun? The caramelized onions, peppers, and cheese were an unlikely but welcome trio with the burger hugged by deep fried goodness.        Don't expect a fancy pants trendy burger joint here. The food speaks for itself and will leave you smiling and very happy!"}
{"text":"I don't see what all of the fuss is about. Yes I had the vegan burger so maybe that was the problem. But honestly why offer something just to have it on the menu?"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger joints. It definitely qualifies as a bit of a \"dive\" as its in an unassuming location in a strip mall next door to a drive-thru liquor store, but don't let that fool you! I came here based on the yelp review and the fact that its incredibly close to home.  I have had the Burger Brulee and the the Beach House. The Burger Brulee is definitely my go-to burger. I would never have thought to mix these ingredients together, but boy does it work!! Some may feel that the size of the burger is a little small (as its not enormous like many restaurant burgers) but I think its perfect. The seasoned fries and sweet potato tots round out the meal perfectly. And if you're feeling up for dessert they milkshakes look amazing, though I'll admit I have yet to try one as the burger and fries usually fill me up."}
{"text":"This is my 1st visit to PVBC using the YELP! option to order/pay online.  First impressions? 1) This little burger joint is so unassuming and so amazing all at the same time.  2) Next time I will definitely dine in so I can get the full affect of the eggy runniness as it covers the burger...mmmmnomnombomb ;)  You ever experience that type of burger where you don't mind the egg yolk running down your hand, along the side of your wrist and forearm? Yuuuupppp! That's this place. My burger is aptly named The Brûlée. Brûlée?...brûlée you say...why have they named it this way? Well as other Yelpers have already posted both pieces of the brioche are actually *gasp* not simply buttered but BRÛLÉED!!! Shut the front door! Why has no one else thought of this before? It was just the right amount of crunch and sweetness to emphasize the flavors of the 2 hand formed hamburger patties, grilled onions, runny egg, and saltiness of the bacon strips.  The sweet potato tots were fresh and not over cooked. The slaw was bang on fresh. Not to be forgotten is the chipotle ketchup and the garlic mayo which paired well with everything (including the slaw!).  Next time I have a hankering for a burger this will be my go to spot."}
{"text":"Truly amazing burger, astounding loaded fries. Loved this place, would definitely come here again if I was back in the area."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger spot in the city.  I've been coming here since it opened and every experience has been top notch, always consistent and delicious.  To accompany the stellar burgers, I always get the Fresno tacos and the fries (which are some of the best I've ever had).  Keep up the great work guys!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry but there's way better options for burger around town. Ordered the Brûlée and it tastes like cheap fast food burger. Do not order the French toast fries! It tastes like old oil. Arizona has a lot of great food joints and unfortunately this place is not up to par."}
{"text":"2nd time and swore I would try something different this time. BUT the Brulee burger was just so damn good that I had to get it again.  Next time...and I hope that it's soon!"}
{"text":"I am a burger fanatic, and I'd put these $6-$7 burgers up against the best in Phoenix. The fries and homemade chips are amazing too!"}
{"text":"this burger place is amazing. I got the brûlée burger and it was so delicious and their french fries are good as well! went on a Saturday at 12:30pm and waiting about ten minutes in a long line and about 10-15 minutes after ordering so not too bad for the long line. not good for large groups as the seating is mostly for 2-4 people. small patio as well for the beautiful days."}
{"text":"Great service. Quicker than you think for as busy it was tonight. Got the fried steak with gravy. Flavors were delicious . Gravy could've been thicker.  Can't wait to try it again."}
{"text":"I got the country fried burger and the wife got a BBQ bacon burger. We got fries and French toast fries. The service was good, but the food was... Meh. The burgers were smaller than expected and the patties seemed like they had been sitting for awhile. The French fries also tasted like they've been sitting. If we go back it will only be for the French toast fries which were pretty good. Overall it was mediocre at best. Won't be back for a burger."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! It's way out of the way but totally worth it! First time in there and customer service was excellent! Only complaint is serving size is a lil small. Great burgers and fries. We will be back to try other items as well!"}
{"text":"Burgers are small, French toast fries were gross,so ordered tots, they came out burnt, pay for a can of pop rather than the watered down soda fountain, better deal, the guys were nice, but we ordered different burgers and they all appeared to be the same, not a fan of all the beards either, looked like a loggers convention"}
{"text":"Yum-O! I've already been twice and I'm hooked! The Burger Brulee was so-dang-good (you can't beat a burger with a fried egg on top!) and the Shrimp Club sandwich was super yummy. I like that they're not afraid to try flavor combinations and they are very modestly priced. My friends had the Country Fried Burger, the Sloppy Joe and the Burger Parm. I had a few bites of each and they were all flavorful and a delight to put in my mouth! I highly recommend the Burger Brulee for those who have not been yet, because it will BLOW YOUR MIND!"}
{"text":"Total hole in the wall experience. Featured on food network. Delicious and creative burgers with the Crème brûlée burger being the best. Burgers wash down nicely with the pairing of a Lucky Charms marshmallow milkshake. I guarantee you haven't had a burger like these before."}
{"text":"The most delicious burgers in town with a diverse menu supporting many and unique combinations of ingredients."}
{"text":"My friend really hyped up this place to me and it was also on Triple D so let's just say I had some very high expectations for this burger joint. Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations. I got a regular cheeseburger with havarti cheese and my wife got their regular hamburger. I was not a fan of the meat. Really thin patties, I usually prefer a bigger patty so it can be cooked to a medium temperature. It also had a really strong charbroiled, smokey flavor which I usually don't mind but it was slightly overwhelming. The bun was delicious though, really soft and butter and probably the best thing here.   Fries were really crispy which I love but they really over did it on the seasoned salt. Jalapeño ranch was underwhelming. I wanted more of a kick from the jalapeño and it tasted more sour cream based so it was pretty thick. Maybe I would return to try one of their specialty burgers like the burger brûlée. My buddy really wants me to try this burger so to make him happy I might go with him and give it another try."}
{"text":"We drove 30 minutes to try this place out, it was busy when we arrived and I have to say for a restaurant that was featured on TV, this place really needs to expand and get a new space! People love you so you guys deserve it. The kitchen was backed up 35 minutes which was a bummer since I couldn't order  the French toast Frys to go after we ate. I just wanted them for dessert but they were too backed up!  All in the all, the burgers were good. The menu is unique and I definitely enjoyed mine. Will go back but only if I'm in there the area!"}
{"text":"Good solid burger with well thought out combinations of ingredients. The place has a bit of a dive feel, which I don't mind at all. Only one issue for me. The bottom bun always gets soggy, I can handle it though in exchange for the quality of the whole. Try it!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorites.  They are always showcasing a new crazy burger.  If you're willing to try something other than a standard burger I saw you to try this place. I've tried all of their salads when I'm not in the burger mood and they're all yummy but my favorite is the Fresno.  My BF would like to go every night if I let him.  Very small place so plan on a wait since they were featured on the food network recently.  All good things come to those who wait...."}
{"text":"I knew this was going to be amazing right off the bat. Kaley (so sorry if not spelled right!) was super sweet, and helpful! She called everybody love, and didn't judge us for the plain Jane burgers we ordered. (Or so we thought.)  So, here's the deal. Homemade jalapeño ranch. Sweet potato tots. Perfectly grilled, buttered bun (I'm thinking brioche) that was seriously trimmed to fit the two beautiful flavor packed burger patties. Perfect bun burger ratio. L, T, Cucumber and pink pickled onions like my daddy always made. Such a satisfying crunch and zing. I couldn't put it down. Incredible. Beautiful flavors. It didn't even need ketchup. And that was just the cheeseburger! I was a little intimidated by all the cool burgers but would have loved to try them. The brûlée seemed to be the most popular one that people ordered. They just opened a pizza place too, a few doors down.   Sadly, we were too full for a red velvet Oreo shake, or anything else. But we were fat and happy."}
{"text":"I didn't realize I ate here and didn't review it.  Very good.  I had the Brulee Burger.  It was great.  Perfectly cooked and very delicious included the sugared bun.  I also had the sweet potato tots, which I loved and my only complaint would be watch the fryer a little closer ;).  Still awesome though.  So why four stars??  Because, this place is great but I wanted something other than a milkshake if you get my drift.  I would and plan on going back a 100 times, but I would really love if I could go for a dinner option and have a glass of wine.  It was also a little small for a stay in option as well.  Great burger.  I would place it higher than other highly acclaimed places, like Rehab, Habit or Smashburger.  It was WAY better."}
{"text":"Good solid burger joint. Wife and I got in around 7pm tonight and found the place hopping. The place is small be we were able to find a seat right away, although my wife did have to grab it while I went and ordered. We got the burger burlee, the beach house burger, regular fries, sweet potato tots and cole slaw. The beach house burger was very tasty and the grilled chili on it gave it great flavor but not a lot of heat, which I would of liked, but was good for most people. The burlee burger was a unique mixture of ingredients that came together nicely. The fries And coleslaw were good sides as was the sweet tots. The only critique I have is next time I will order the tots cook a tad crispier and with what ever seasoning they put on the regular fries. All in all a solid place I will go back to."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Small greasy burger joint that would remind one of the burger restaurants that you used to frequent back in college after hitting the bars. In fact i would expect a place like this to be more at home in Tempe on ASU campus as opposed to a strip mall in PV. At any rate the place has about 8 tables, fairly well taken care of although I wouldn't take a first date here. Patrons are all ages.  Food: It's all out assault on a heart healthy diet here as a variety of greasy burgers, tacos and tater-tots rule here. The ultimate comfort food when your willing to throw caution to the wind. The PV burger is delicious as is the shrimp sandwich. You have a choice of different buns (white,brioche or wheat) which I appreciate.  The sweet potatoes tater-tots were killer! I could eat those all day. The size of burgers is decent, smaller than a Wendy's to give perspective.  Service: I tried calling in a order but the phone must have been left off the hook bc it consistently was busy for 30 minutes. I showed up and asked what was up but no one seemed to have a clue (and no one was on the phone). The girl taking my order was apologetic but it didn't seem like she or the manager were motivated to correct the situation. They've since fix the issue, I only mention it bc I think they have some room for improvement but they're decent enough for a burger joint.  Price: Not bad actually. So many specialty burger places are getting ridiculously expensive it's nice to see some moderation.  Overall: A great place if your in the mood for some serious good greasy comfort food!"}
{"text":"A friend brought me here for the first time. I was blown away when I took a bite out of my burger. I ordered their signature burger brûlée and wow!!!!! Probably one of the best burgers I've had in the valley.   The place is located in Paradise valley. The staff are great and very friendly.   I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a delicious burger in the paradise valley area."}
{"text":"What a great spot to support a private, non chain, restaurant.  Great food and half the price of the trendy burger places elsewhere in town.  Can't say enough good things about the food and service.  It is a casual setting, like something you would expect to find in a beach town.   Even though it is basically burgers and tacos, some thought is put into it.  A Brulee Burger!!!  French Toast fries!  Love this place.   Please support these guys!"}
{"text":"They should have wet wipes instead of napkins, and I mean that as a compliment.  Despite some incredibly enticing flavor combos in specialty selections, I had an \"ordinary\" cheese burger with a slice of green chile. I say \"ordinary\" with quotation marks because, in addition to the standard lettuce, tomato and special sauce, it came topped with cucumber and pickled onion (which were awesome!).    These burgers are THIN -- you get 2 2oz patties that are still pink inside. That's a quarter of a pound when you're done with it FYI.   We happened to go on the night their Diners, Drive Ins and Dives episode was to air; so, of course, I looked forward to tuning in and comparing notes! ;)  You know what they totally missed!? Besides these kick ass burgers they have this freakishly awesome, no-doubt-addictive seasoning on the seasoned fries. YOU HAVE TO TRY THEM! First, I thought my boyfriend's \"brûlée\" bun got on our fries and then I felt the heat followed by a mild tang and I realized: that's the seasoning!! OMG!   If the burgers don't bring you back (and I suspect they will) then these fries DEFINITELY will!"}
{"text":"Order through yelp - easy, order was ready, refunded no questions asked a missing fry order. Had grilled cheese which was fresh and not greasy. Very good."}
{"text":"yup--this is the best burger you'll ever eat.  It's simply amazing.  I am a purest when it comes to burgers.  I like simple hamburgers without a lot of stuff on it.  This was the exception.  Their basic burger has tiny slices of cucumber, a small amount of sauer kraut and tomatoes.  If someone told me I was having that on my burger, I would never have come here.  Instead, it was unbelievably good.  The fries were perfection and the milk shake was extraordinary.  The place is a dump but the food is the real deal.  To the owner, not only are your burgers the best but good job by having salt, pepper, and squeeze bottles of ketchup and mustard on each table.  I hate the tiny packaged ketchups and mustards that some places have."}
{"text":"Came with a few friends, really enjoyed the jalapeño fries. The burgers were good, sweet crisp bun, but the meats were a bit on the salty side.  Aside from that, everything else was great."}
{"text":"Quick stop for lunch. Delicious and affordable. Friendly staff. New fav place for a burger."}
{"text":"Great place, very relaxed atmosphere. excellent burger, not in love with the signature pickled Onions... But worth a try... Great tunes... overall 4+ stars"}
{"text":"It was a good burger but I don't think the whole meal was worth $11. The burger was kind of small for the price."}
{"text":"Have had this place bookmarked for ages! Finally had to give it a try after hearing it was featured on food network. What lured me in to trying out Paradise Valley Burger Company was all of the vegetarian choices! They have a great variety for vegetarians, tacos, sandwich, and you can get a portobello mushroom in place of a burger patty! My friend and I went on a Friday night and it was pretty packed! The restaurant is small, not a whole lot of seating, and we got ours to go. When we ordered we were warned that it would take about 20-30 minutes to get our food and we almost changed our minds, but luckily it did not end up taking that long! I ordered the paradise burger with a portobello mushroom, and my friend ordered a bacon cheeseburger. I also got a side of sweet potato tater tots. I sort of wish I would have ordered something else, because I feel like the mushroom wasn't seasoned enough or something, but the rest of the \"burger\" was tasty. Sweet potato tots were delicious as well. Wishing I would have tried the lucky charms marshmallow milkshake..but maybe next time! My friend liked his burger too. Would recommend this place to meat lovers and vegetarians."}
{"text":"First time here.  Pretty nice little spot.  Avoid the lunch rush though, not a ton of places to sit.  Overall  the food was good, burgers are flavorful.  They are smaller patties.  They use a Brioche bun which was a nice plus.  Seasoned fries were great!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly.  My burger was horrible. I was excited for this for two weeks. My burger was the country fried. I checked the patties twice (which i upgraded to a triple) and I'm certain they were not fried. The gravy they put on the side was so light tasting it was waste of time to put on the burger.   I got a fry and chip. Both covered in two much seasoning.   My wife's burger was underdone and very greasy. The fried onions were a bit old oil tasting. The burger being underdone ruined it for her and me. They get so busy that there's no way to return food with mistakes.   I had a seat where I could see the kitchen. I know its not a requirement for restaurants to use gloves in AZ but it was gross to see the staff touch their clothes which were not clean every time they put something on a tray. The bare food fondling ruined it for me also.   Bottom line its not a good burger. The best thing was the sweet potato tots. Everything else was gross. Not to mention when it was all said and done it was 25$.  UPDATE 2018  Went back on May 30th. To only find the same issues. I even tried another different burger. This place lacks so many things like food safety or even quality food. I waited 3 years to give it another try. So dissatisfied in the food I ate today. Wish I could have my 20$ back. I will tell you I'll give them credit cause they must not care about what people think. 3 years ago the owner said he would work on the staff wearing gloves while they cook and that must have been a lie. Don't waste your money. I already did twice now."}
{"text":"I have no idea what the fuss is all about. This place isn't a big deal. Kitchen is slow. Burgers are lean and dry yet they were busy at lunch. There are loads of burger joints way better than this. Fries were ok, but over salted. Not cheap."}
{"text":"This was my second time here. The first one would have been less stars.   I am a burger snob, I like em fat and juicy, cooked med rare, over a flame. I like back yard burgers with let, tom and pickles, mustard and mayo...you get it.   PVBC does a small thin patty cooked the way they want. With fancy toppings and interesting creations. This works and works well.   I ordered the Beach House, \"under cooked\" with fries. The Beach House is roasted? green chili, smoked mozzarella, pico de gallo.   The burger looked amazing, great presentation. The flavor were perfect together and worked well. The under cooked help the meat be moist still.    The fries were great, I believe they are \"sugar dusted\" as well. LOL I liked dipping them in the Jalapeno Ranch.   It is obvious they care about the handmade and fresh ingredients here...it shows.  Well done guy's well done."}
{"text":"My husband and I love trying local burger joints. I was in the area for work when I saw this small hidden gem. I decided to try this small local burger shop. Let me tell me you my burger did not disappoint. I had there infamous beach house burger which had a nice kick of spice but not too much were I couldn't finish it. Their fries are more on the sweet side due to the brown sugar seasoning they use. I am not a fan of sweet food but that didn't stop me from chopping down on more than half my plate. I will be returning and bringing my husband to try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Solid spot amazing food fun chill environment!! Dive style and really nice people working there!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute joint! This is a small hole in the wall restaurant in a strip mall. We initially came here for the burgers because of the high yelp reviews and were underwhelmed by the initial curb appeal but went in anyway. I am sure glad we did! The food is delicious and fairly priced. The staff was so friendly and sweet. They have fun unique menu items that put a spin on a classic burger and fries. For example, the french fries had a delicious bbq seasoning. We had a custom order that was brought out incorrectly and the apologized and made a new order without question. The food was worth the trip and was very good."}
{"text":"The vibe of this place is really cool; casual, beachy, clean, modern. And the burgers we got were delicious. I got the beach house burger, subbing the meat patty for grilled chicken and my friend got the burger brûlée. Both were delicious. I also had to get the pretzel fries they were offering that day because they just sounded to interesting to miss. They were really good, but I preferred the fries my friend ordered with his burger brûlée, classic fries with a good amount of seasoning. The pretzel fries did come with this amazing trifecta sauce, I think it was ranch, mustard and ketchup - not mixed but served in the same container... Delicious concoction."}
{"text":"Good burgers.  We had the basic cheese and it was a solid 8 out of 10.   The customer service was brief but we still enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Guns N Roses - Paradise City)  Take me down to the Paradise Valley Where the place is dive and the Guy is Fieri Take me Yelp! Take me down to the Paradise Valley Where the burgers are fried and the shakes are milky Take me Yelp!   After hearing an ear full of this place I finally attending with some friends after a good workout.    The place is dink and dive for sure as Guy Fieri was made known to have attended on the walls.  Finding a seat can be challenging I must say so come as minimal as possible!    For my food I started with their Paradise Burger with cheese and bacon along with some fries.  I ordered a fountain drink, but totally wanted a beer!  The Paradise Burger came with lettuce, tomato, pickled onions, cucumber; I added bacon and cheddar cheese with mines.  Overall the burger patty was cooked just the way I wanted it; medium.  The texture was fine since the cucumber and the pickled onion added some needed crunch along with a sweet and sourness to it.  The bun ratio to patty was perfect!  I love that part; however it was a tad bit messy eating it.  As a continue to eat looked over to my buddy; I asked what you think?  He shrugged his shoulders and to be honest so did I.  Was the place over-hyped?  Beats me, but I thought the burger was okay overall.    In the end, the burger was decent.  They definitely had some combinations of ingredients that would be fun to add to burgers and general.  I just went real basic to see what the rave was and next; I'll probably be more playful.  The fries were very basic and plus I really really needed a beer haha! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"In spite of the reviews here, this place still seems like a hidden gem. The place itself doesn't look like much but the staff is very friendly, and the hamburgers are some of the best that I have ever eaten, in all of my life.  I'm fortunate enough that the place is close to work and I've been there a few times with co-workers and we usually all order the week's special. The pictures make the special of the week seem almost randomly put together but once you bite into it and get all the flavors together, you realize that the chef is a genius.  We have not been dissapointed by anything that we've eaten there.  We'll keep coming back to try the new specials.  As much as I dislike Guy Fieri, I have to thank him for finding this place."}
{"text":"Stop by with the family to grab some tasty burgers and tots and we were surprisingly somewhat disappointed.  It's been over a year since we've eaten here last and I thought it would be the same or even better but we found ourselves leaving, thinking we should have stopped by the Islands restaurant or In-N-Out maybe.    I had their special, Batter Up for $9.50.  Not sure why this thing cost some much.  It had two patties (it needs two patties since they are uber small) a couple of small slices of kielbasa topped with BBQ potatoes chips.  It was okay, nothing I would ever order again.  My son had their Paradise cheese burger.  It was much better than mine for $3 less however my son did not like the cucumbers on the burger nor did I.  Wifey had their tacos which she really enjoyed.  We ordered H2O to drink however it was cucumber infused water that tasted like it needed a refresher or something, very stale.  The sweet tater tots were okay, but they were a bit mushy.    If you like cucumbers, this is totally the place for you!   (Side note to the owner/manager your music was a little loud.  We were struggling to hear our convo.   You also need to wash off your front side walk and tables to make a better impression with your customers)."}
{"text":"Burgers are great. Shakes are awesome. Prices are cheap. Ambience is a greasy burger joint. Overall a good place for burgers but I would get your food to go."}
{"text":"First time I tried this, my boyfriend claimed it to be the best burgers ever, he got take out for me & ordered a paradise burger with carmelized onions. Loved the smokiness of the burger but it had wayyy too much carmelized onions if that was even possible. Second time I tried it I had the Pulled Pork Sandwich & it was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I am not a burger snob I just like a simple burger that is fresh and has some good beef flavor.  And that is what I got for my money. The bun was fresh and toasted. The burger juicy and cooked just right.   You can get a burger pretty much any way you want but it will cost you for each additional item The service was okay, the ambiance was okay nothing special.  I wish they served beer and wine but oh well.  A few sports TV's would be nice too  I will be back to try a few other tempting items on the menu!"}
{"text":"The place isn't as fancy as the name suggests, but it's a local strip mall joint with semi fancy burgers. Let me start by saying I'm not a fan of sweetness in pizza or burgers. PVBC Seems to be the opposite. It seems like everything has an extra helping of sweetness. The lemon vinaigrette has a bit of sweetness, the burger bun is sweet and so is the thousand island dressing.  Was it a bad burger? No, but it would have been a better burger if the level of sweetness was brought down a notch or Two.  Not a bad place to try once in a while if you're a local."}
{"text":"The food here is so deliciously creative! We decided to split two things when we went so we could try more. That was a good idea. Try as much food as you can! We had the brûlée burger ... It was amazing. That burnt sugar taste is so delicate and ferocious at the same time. Love the egg .. Loved all of it. We also split the BLT and that was quite tasty. The jalapeño ranch is pretty hot and I asked for it light. I'd probably get it on the side next time. The fries are amazing but the chips aren't quite so good. Also, the carnival corn is so  good .. You have to try that. The mix of spices is delish. Plus, I seem to have a thing for restaurants that serves coke in cans. And they do!"}
{"text":"Came here the first time and they recommended the beach house and the brûlée. Went with the brûlée and it was really good. Worth it for $7.  Came here for a second time and tried the beach house. SOO different, but it's still a solid choice nonetheless.  Cons: The baskets, chairs and tables need to be better cleaned. I got unlucky and got some sticky residue on some furniture."}
{"text":"Really liked this place overall.  Saw it on diners drive ins and dives and thought I had to check this place out!  It is defiantly a divey type place, it sits in a little shopping center area and the inside is pretty small with minimal decor.    The staff was great, we were helped immediately at the counter and every experience with them was nothing short of awesome.  The menu is pretty small but awesome at the same time.  They seem to do a few things really well.  There was so much we wanted to try but didn't have the stomach capacity for at the time.  We went with a couple burgers to include the daily special and some sweet potato tots.  Great choice if I do say so.  It was prepared fresh and fast and was right out in no time.    Honestly I was surprised at the size of the food.  I guess I'm so used to today's huge American sized everything that the smaller burger size surprised me at first.  That being said I think it was so refreshing and great.  It's the perfect size to be satisfied, not over stuffed and not having to take home things you'll never eat again.  Very delicious!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was going to be a total gimmick when I saw the pics on Yelp.  Who'd have thunk it, my BBQ burger was one of the best I've had in the valley.  We also had a maple bacon shake and French toast fries - total sugar overload and quite delicious.  This place'll definitely wreck your health, but is quite good and I'd highly recommend to anyone seeking a gourmet burger."}
{"text":"This place is a great hole in the wall burger joint.  All of their burgers are delicious and the prices are reasonable.  I had the brulee burger the last couple of visits and it was fantastic.  Their fries are seasoned very well and their iced tea is always fresh and not bitter."}
{"text":"To die for! A friend recommended this place when I mentioned we were going to be visiting Scottsdale and were glad we checked it out! Delish and gourmet burgers at decent prices (for what you get)!"}
{"text":"Great owner and takes interest in his customers!  I went and wasn't impressed with the food, owner contacted me apologized for the experience and asked that I give his restaurant another try.  Any establishment that takes the time to reach out to a customer and apologize for their experience...is a restaurant I want to support. My husband and I will be back to try the food again."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy! Creative burgers, yummy sweet potato tots and gear shakes! What's not to love?"}
{"text":"What an awesome place with a unique menu. The food is amazing and if you have never had Canadian Tots, you HAVE to try them! Had the burger brûlée and it was unreal good. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Good hole in the wall burger place.  My buger was made to order and delicious.  The fries are also good.  The portion sizes are good.  Not enough seating g a t lunch time but hey that's a good thing as the place draws a crowed."}
{"text":"This is an excellent little burger joint. Good food, quality ingredients, friendly staff."}
{"text":"A friend of mine raves about this place and I finally got the chance to check it out for a weekday lunch. I almost missed it off 40th street, signage is hardly noticeable unless you are up close to the restaurant. I walked inside and the restaurant is small and casual. Staff is very friendly and I even got to say hello to the owner. I went through the menu and decided on the Texas BBQ burger with sweet potato tots. Order comes out pretty quickly but I notice the portions are pretty small. The burger itself was tasty- I liked that it was different but very messy to eat. The sweet potato tots were also good but the ranch for some reason was very off to me. It wasn't the white, creamy stuff I'm used to, rather almost a yellowish color and very thick. I didn't like that. Overall, I liked P.V. Burger Company and would go again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been seeing pictures of this burger joint's \"food porn\" on Facebook, so we decided to try it. It was an excellent decision. There are so many burger places in Phoenix that provide a great burger. However, if you'd like to kick your burger eating up a notch, this is the best place to go. Not only do they have a great amount of specialty burgers, but they also have awesome fries and milkshakes. My boyfriend got the Brulé burger, which was divine. I got a specialty burger with Havarti cheese, and it was equally delicious. I should mention that their fries are absolutely the BEST...I'm not sure what they sprinkle them with, but I suspect it's crack, some type of barbecue seasoning and sugar. (jk) Whatever it is, the fries do not need any ketchup...it will ruin them! We also had two milkshakes. He had a maple bacon shake, which was made with real smoky, crispy bacon bits, not the crappy ones that you find in the salad dressing aisle. I had the fluffernutter shake, and it was awesome...chunks of marshmallow, banana and peanut butter...Yum! If you're looking for a break from your regular burger routine, I strongly suggest you give Paradise Valley Burger Company a try. You won't be disappointed. And... don't forget the fluffernutter milkshake."}
{"text":"She was sweet, she took our order minutes before closing. Food was very very good. Including the French toast Fry's."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy going to PV Burger.  He always gets the bacon cheeseburger.  I've gotten the cheeseburger with caramelized onions and the tacos. We've yet to have a bad meal there.  The owners are great guys and we love the char taste of the burgers with all the fixings.  The seasoned fries are yummy, but we ask for them with less seasoning and they're still delicious.  Don't know what the others were talking about no refills. We've always received refills when we are there.  IMHO, this place beats fast food burgers any day."}
{"text":"Yum Yum!  This burger joint is too die for !!!  My hubby got the Brule Burger & Lucky Charms Milkshake and I got the Portobello Mushroom and the fries.  Great Food and Great Service.  We will be coming back real soon!  Don't miss this Gem :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great and service is always friendly. For your first time I'd suggest the Brule Burger.  Egg over easy with beacon delicious! New specials every week."}
{"text":"Excellent service by genuinely nice guys- fantastic burgers- and packed house! No wonder they were on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives!!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3-4 times.  I get a traditional cheeseburger that is juicy and a perfect size.  The staff has always been friendly.  I went last week and there was a long line.  Come to find out that it was on DDD.  NOOO!! Now more people know about this place.  Darn!  It is a smaller burger, but a good one with lots of choices for unique toppings."}
{"text":"What more can you say about a restaurant that KNOWS they have the best burgers in the neighborhood?!?  The burgers here are the equivalent of having professional runway models at a Community Center Fashion Show, exceeds every expectation you have of a good burger!  I have been back numerous times and love every visit.  I have tried nearly the entire menu already, but could have the same thing over and over and be satisfied as well.  With a cool and friendly staff and a clean place to eat, you can't ask for much more in a burger joint.  I'm glad they are just in the one location, as businesses tends to falter in quality when they start to expand.  I bring all of my friends and family here when they come to visit.  Don't come here expecting your typical fast-food burger, these grilled meat delicacies are a 10, to a Burger King's 2."}
{"text":"Pretty Darn Good. Had the Brule Burger. Savory, Sweet, Fresh, and very Fulfilling.  Need to come back soon."}
{"text":"Good tasting food, great customer service, good prices.   I went with the boys and we had the bacon cheeseburger!  Yum, yum, yum!   The pickled red onions really made the burger sing.    I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Chicken fried burger and Cardinals fries. Sooo good!!! But the restaurant is small and it gets busy."}
{"text":"When somebody tells me that they had a really good burger at a certain burger joint, my mind goes into a frenzy to get a taste of that burger. I turn into a blood hungry piranha or should I say a burger hungry food blogger. When a friend mentioned to me that Paradise Valley Burger Co. offers some really good burgers, I knew I needed to get a taste of it.   As I have pointed out in my previous blogs, a good burger should have high quality juicy patty, cheesy cheese, soft bread, tasty sauce and perfectly complimenting toppings. In my opinion the burgers at Paradise Valley Burger Co. somewhat and someway met all of those criteria. Good burgers added with a  relaxing vibe of the restaurant and the not so bad service, I would definitely come back for another burger addiction satisfaction.  The place had a very playful and relaxing feel. The colorful green and orange walls with the classic blackboard menu made me feel like its kindergarten all over again.  There were enough seats inside and additional seats outside. Every table had a napkin holder, mustard, ketchup, black grounded pepper and sriracha. Overall, the restaurant was clean, playful and family friendly.  The service on the other hand needs to match the feel of the place. I cannot fully enjoy a burger if it wasn't served with a smile. It may be my fault though. I came in 30 minutes before the closing time  and maybe (this is me giving the benefit of the doubt) people are already tired from a long and busy day. I can't smile if I'm still busy 30 minutes before I leave the office. Maybe I shouldn't expect to get a smile everytime or a recommendation of what is the best out of their menu or maybe I'm just being dramatic. They did replace my side order when I changed my mind 5 minutes after ordering. So I guess, I was just looking for a little effort to make me feel more welcome.  The food was ok. Not over the top good. Not bad either. It was just OK. I blame it on my bad order choice this time. I wanted to try their special for the week. For that week, it was \"Cockeyed Cowboy\". It was already after I ordered when I asked what was the best seller out of their menu. I was told that the Brulee and Beach House were the stars of the show. My wife got the Brulee, but we went for the healthy option that had a portabello mushroom patty instead of the traditional beef patty. So how was it????  Burger of the week - Cockeyed Cowboy. It's really nice when a burger gives you a certain crunch on every bite. Say a crispy bacon or the toasted bun or maybe that crispy fried onion rings. But when you bite on a slightly popped popcorn on a burger, hmmm... I think something is really wrong. Don't get me wrong. I am a popcorn lover, if t is properly popped. I just feel like a slightly popped popcorn may have been and after thought to give the cowboy burger a corn like finish that turned out to be a little corny. What's so cowboy about popcorn anyway? I get the pulled pork. It was cooked very well and the smoke flavour (or maybe it was the barbecue sauce) was really good. The beef patty was a little dry. Seasoned well but like I said, a little dry. What really made the burger OK (refer to previous paragraph) was the dill pickle. They make good pickle. Another component that I loved was the poblano creme. It gave the burger a slight kick that complimented the sweet pulled pork. The burger at $9.50, seemed like it was trying a little too hard.   The Brûlée. Now this burger has some potential. We made a mistake of substituting the beef patty with the portabello mushroom. Not that the portabello mushroom was bad (the patty substitute was actually very good), but only because beef patties are sooooo much better. The portabello mushroom was cooked well. It was not bland and was very juicy. I would love to have it on top of the beef patty on my next visit. It may cut through the dryness of the beef and eventually make the burger so much better. The creamy acidity from the Havarti cheese complimented well with the fried egg, bacon and toasted Brioche bun. Oh.. and the Brioche is just a bed of goodness. I think the bun is really the kicker at this joint. Something I would definitely comeback and crave for someday. The pickled onions were a surprise. I think they perfected the pickling process. The verdict on the portabello brûlée burger is definitely more than OK. What more if we had beef patty? Maybe it really deserves a second visit. Maybe I missed on a really good burger.  Overall, Paradise Valley Burger Co. is not a bad choice for a burger binge. The place is really nice and clean, the service only needs a little bit of sunshine, and the food has a lot of potential. Would I come back? Yes. They deserve it. Would I recommend it? Maybe. They are good enough to get a maybe and an OK.   Read my other reviews at http://themealexperience.blogspot.com"}
{"text":"So good, I had the \"beach house\" and LOVED it!  No need for anything other than what it comes with.  The burger was cooked perfectly, and the green chili was cooked even better.  The jalapeño ranch was just the right amount of heat. Finished it off with a side of sweet potato tots.  Even got to listen to some Cake - The Distance as I made quick work of it all. Great experience!"}
{"text":"I live right down the street and when I crave a burger there isn't another place I think of first. Outstanding food, creativity, and service. I usually go for the special burger because they are always amazing."}
{"text":"Okay went here like many because it was on triple-D on food network.  This place is a modest burger joint with an ambitious menu which I had an immediate problem with...  I could not  decide what to order!  I pretty much wanted to sample the menu and everything I saw coming out of the kitchen.  So I settled in on the beach burger with roasted peppers, poblano I believe.  It looked normal enough but it was actually extraordinary .  I wasn't sure about the peppers but that flavor perfectly complemented the burger.  Fries were great.  I hope they are always that hot.    Finally,  can't wait to get back to try some more of the offerings, probably whatever special they have.  As I understand it the special is not only a limited menu item but is also a pretty good value.  Last week special features double patty, sweet tots for $9.95."}
{"text":"So goood. And a very clean place. I ordered to go and it was ready in less than 5 mins.   Order: brûlée burger ( fried egg, bacon, melted havarti cheese, lettuce, onion) and homemade chips for $8. Yum yum yum...will be coming here again"}
{"text":"Not much to add when an establishment has so many great reviews.  Just that this is by far the best burger spot in the valley and beat the chains restaurants any day.   The special is always a nice change if you've tried everything  else. I also like the French toast fries. Great treat for that sweet tooth."}
{"text":"I discovered this little gem of a place with my co-worker on our lunch hour. We were very pleasanly surprised and we have been coming ever since! One of the best burgers I have had in a looong time. Try the brule or the bacon cheese burger..OMG SO TASTY! And the seasoned fries are yummy too. I'm a big fan of local spots and this one is just great. Try it!"}
{"text":"Divey little place in a strip mall with really good burgers and fries. My son had one of their burgers at Chase Field so we thought we would give their retail outlet a try. Its tucked away in this nondescript strip mall and is a no frills type of place. But ohhhh the burgers were so good.  The brûlée burger was really good. Who would have though burnt sugar would change the overall gestalt of the burger, the egg, the bacon, all became one.   The fries were crispy with just the right amount of salt.  The only thing missing was draft beer!!!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest bang for your buck for a very standard burger and fries. Nothing special"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! I loved my brule Burger, especially with the siracha! Fries were perfect! Sweet tots very good! Corn very yummy and a cool menu item I think. I also tasted the chipotle ketchup and I liked it."}
{"text":"I had the Paradise Chz burger and it was delish. Sweet tator tots off-this-planet amazing. My husband had the special, it was shepards pie burger, or something like that, it was pretty good too. Will be coming back soon for some great burgers that don't cost $15 or so! Great service, too!"}
{"text":"Very good burgers and milkshakes. Great service. The owner is usually there. Dive restaurant so don't expect anything to nice."}
{"text":"This place is an all around winner in my book.  The food is fresh and delicious!  I've had the tacos, beach house burger and the pulled cabbage sandwich.  I'm a carnivore at heart but I think the cabbage is my new favorite!  They have different choices of bread that include 9 grain if you're trying to keep things on the healthy side.  I think I need to hit this place up weekly."}
{"text":"Extremely amazing. I can give this place a definite 5-stars. Their burgers are mouth watering tasty and you will crave it soon after you have your first meal. We found this place from Yelp reviews and I am glad I did. I ate here because I was starving so of course it was good but then I went back the next day when I was just hungry and the quality had not changed. Great, laid back staff who converse with you and make sure you are happy. Please, if you are in the area, check it out because this is by far one of the best burgers I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall burger shop is a must do every time I'm in the Phoenix area. Friendly staff, and never too busy, even during the lunch hours. The burgers are always top notch and cooked perfectly. The burger of the week always keeps the menu fresh. Can't leave without getting a lucky charms milkshake. Not too thick and not too sweet. Can't wait til the next visit!"}
{"text":"Love this place. They have tacos but I stick to burgers here and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked burgers, and the fries have a very different (but delicious) flavor that I've never tasted before! Super unique and wonderful place :) excited to go back and eat here again!"}
{"text":"Burger was hands down the best burger I've ever gotten from a restaurant. I got the Diablo burger and everything on it was great. The jalapenos were fresh and crispy along with amazing patty. Everything tasted amazing and it was relatively fast service. We will be back again and it is highly recomended."}
{"text":"The brioche burger was sloppy to eat but it tasted delicious. I wasn't expecting the brown sugar toasted bun but it complimented the brioche cheese nicely.     The location is in a dumpy strip mall but the service was nice and the food was great. I also had the sweet potato tots. They were very good with a little Siracha / ketchup mix."}
{"text":"The burgers were to die for. Everybody knows that. Only problem is, if I'm paying $7 for a milkshake it shouldn't take half an hour to make and it definitely shouldn't taste like absolute poo. I'll be back for the burgers & sweet potato tots. I'll go get my milkshake fix elsewhere....anywhere but here haha."}
{"text":"I love this place! The burgers are DELISH! The classic bacon cheese burger is a must!  The only thing is I always ask for unseasoned or lightly seasoned fries, the seasoning they put on there can be a little much for me."}
{"text":"The hype for me was triple D rated  - Drive in Diners and Dives. Solid burger but small. Tasty fries. They had a solid flow of people so they are getting loyal fans.  Would compare them to the quality of In & Out Burgers - not bad."}
{"text":"Fun and unique food with a laid back atmosphere and kind service people.  Seriously delicious!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal. Everything about this place.   I was in Cave Creek and decided to Yelp it up for lunch on my way home from work. Apparently I bookmarked this place awhile back, saw the insane amount of good reviews and decided to try it out myself. AMAZING. I got the Burger Brulee....mmmm. And seasoned fries....mmmm. Their homemade ranch....mmmm. The staff was super friendly and personable. RECOMMEND IN A HEART BEAT"}
{"text":"The Best Burger Ever! The tastiest fries EVER! The friendliest staff! I absolutely love the food here. My husband and I will return and bring other family members with us. This location was featured on Diners Drive ins and Dives with Guy Fieri. The burgers were juicy and came with pickled red onion, cheese, tomato, cucumber and their special mayonnaise. The bun was flavorful too, with a hint of sweetness. The French fries were seasoned with a seasoning that is between sweet and lightly spicy. I ordered the tea and it too was refreshing with a tropical taste. My husband had ice water with cucumber in it. I can't write enough about how yummy the food is here. The setting is comfortable with good music playing--from older R & B to soul! Love, love, love it!!!! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Go to burger place next time I am in Scottsdale.  Burger is juicy and crispy at the sane time.  Carnival corn is unique.  Fries are good, with the added spice.  Star of the show is the grilled cheese!  It was awesome!"}
{"text":"Love this place especially their gluten free lucky charm milkshake! Stopped in today for just that and their yummy fries love dipping them in their hose made jalapeño ranch!!"}
{"text":"Sweet potato fries. So yummy. Best.  Too bad they don't have more seating, this place gets PACKED."}
{"text":"Great \"hole in the wall\" burger joint in North Phoenix. The prices are reasonable ($5.25 for a regular burger) with $1-3 sides. They have a weekly specialty burger which is always killer. This week was the \"Tripple Demon\" which I obviously had to order. Burger patty, breaded pork medallion, ham off the bone with all the fixins. Amazing stuff.   Must try their sweet potato tots, beach house burger and brûlée burger."}
{"text":"I loved the pull vegetarian it taste just like the real thing. Many vegetarian options as well as meat eaters. Staff is friendly too."}
{"text":"Delicious! We keep trying their new burgers and are always blown away! Delicious, great service and busy."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! Amazing combinations and kids meals, too! We go as often as we can:)"}
{"text":"if you're looking for a real basic place to eat but with great food this is your place!"}
{"text":"During my \"big trip\" to PHX, I pulled up Yelp hoping to find the best burger. I was led here and feel deceived by my fellow yelpers and Guy Fieri! Look at all the glowing reviews about this \"brûlée burger\" and \"French toast fries\". I will admit the offerings are unique but to claim it as \"the best burger ever\" or \"heavenly\".... I agree to disagree as it comes up short. The burger was pretty good as the buns had a hint of sweetness and the pickled onions was an interesting twist. It didn't knock my socks off and the hamburger patty was pretty thin and average like a McDonald's hamburger. The French toast fries were solid but nothing special - it's like a fried county fair batter consistency that you dip in syrup. Plus, who can't make French toast at home these days? All in all, I give it a solid 3 stars despite the hype and being called \"bud\" 5x by the staff. If you're passing thru, give it a try but make sure you have low expectations."}
{"text":"I stopped in to this place on my way to PHX because of the glowing reviews I read on Yelp. I was not at all disappointed. The PVBC is in a small strip mall, and the dining room is large enough to accommodate 20 diners (maybe).   We ordered at the counter and took our seats. I ate the brûlée burger, which I understand is their signature burger. My friends each had the paradise bacon and cheese burgers, and they were pleased. The best thing we are was easily the fries with pulled pork poutine. They were incredible.  The staff was very friendly and attentive. The only thing I would point out is that the portions are not as large as some of their competitors. That said, they do care about the burger craftsmanship and offer add ons like bacon and extra patties, so if your appetite is there, maybe consider that."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and was not impressed.   My burger was overcooked and flavorless. It was just a small ball of meat so only the middle of the sandwich had any meat.   The toppings were fine...but nothing special. This place seems to be hyped up since it was featured on the food network with Guy Fieri....but as usual, when I go to those places I see on the food network, I'm disappointed.   I will say that we enjoyed the sides. The sweet potato tots AND the homemade chips were excellent. BUT I probably won't be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"One of 4 Diner, Drives and Dives I visited this long weekend while taking in some Spring Training baseball. I've been disappointed with some DDD spots, but this one is the worst place I've ever eaten at. The entire place is extremely dirty (floor, tables and condiments area). It's clear the owner(s) are over their heads when it comes to service; took 45 minutes to get two burgers! Hamburgers were skimpy and without flavor. I orders two burgers; Boos Burger and Country Burger, which was featured on DDD. There are many other options when it comes to burgers in the area such as Smash Burger, Five Guys, etc. Don't waste your time or money....even the run down strip center is dirty."}
{"text":"horrible.  burger slopped together falling apart when opened.  no sauce on it. and it was cold. tots were cold.  and the cole slaw was wrapped in tin foil and leaked all over.  no ketchup   i wouldn't order from here again"}
{"text":"Did I just eat a decadent crab cake served on a burger!?! That was delicious but I didn't save room for milkshake :( I have been here several times. You won't find such intricate ingredients in any other hole in the wall burger joint. If you dont want a milk shake go to PV Pizza Co. next door for a cannoli."}
{"text":"BEST BURGERS IVE EVER HAD!  Very unique and creative burgers that taste great.  Top 3 burgers are the country fried burger, the beach house burger, and the brulee burger.  The burger special of the week is almost always incredible."}
{"text":"Recommended by a local bank employee, I went there 3 times during my 12 day stay in Phoenix.  Hamburgers are extraordinarily good, the place has a great business vibe and the staff is friendly.  Fries and shakes are also outstanding. Crowded during lunch, but is almost always a good sign."}
{"text":"Coming from a \"food critic\".....this is the best burger joint that we have found and we would recommend this place to ANYONE! We loved their Brulee Burger...starting with a slightly burnt sugar coated bread that melts in your mouth as you bite into it ... this mouth watering burger bursts with flavor as the fried egg breaks open and the bacon and cheese combine in flavor giving you the most perfect moment! You could never go wrong with this order. On top of the savory fries...they have a jalapeno ranch that is a perfect combination with the sweetness of seasoning. We also tried their fresco tacos that were out of this world and bursting with freshness of flavor!!! A++++ This family owned business is a must do if you enjoy good food."}
{"text":"My family and I tried this place based on a recommendation. It's definitely not much to look at from the outside which I'm sure turns off a lot of people. They definitely need some curb appeal help  (or is this intentional to sell the \"dive\" look?) Anyway we have it a shot and we were happy we did!  We tried the brûlée burger, chicken fried burger, and shared some cajun fries. Dang that brûlée burger was good! On the menu it seems so odd but somehow it all just works. It is so unique and definitely worth a shot! The fries were equally amazing-- they had cajun seasoning and light dusting of sugar! I would definitely recommend checking out Paradise Valley Burger Company!"}
{"text":"One word: YUM!  The burgers are juicy and delicious.  The restaurant is quite small and was packed when we came in.  The black board behind the register has all the items on the menu written on it, but unless you had been there before, it really doesn't tell you anything.  There are a ton of burgers, sandwiches and even tacos to choose from.  My hubby got a burger with roasted chili and pico de gallo on it, and I got the classic cheeseburger with Havarti.  We both loved the flavor and I thought the portion was perfect, but my hungry hubby could have eaten a little bit more.  I loved the use of cucumbers on the burger; it was something I'd never had before.  We also loved the jalapeno ranch dressing that we used to dip our fries into.  Soooo good!"}
{"text":"This place is a new and refreshing take on a burger place and the food is on point! Everything we ordered was delicious and perfectly executed- from the toasted bun to the pickled or caramelized onions. Things you wouldn't expect- like a cucumber on your burger were fresh and awesome! The seasoned fries were dialed to perfection and the chocolate malt was stunning. Cannot wait to go back!! Definitely getting the lucky charms milkshake. Only complaint is that the floors were sticky- not like dirty, but like they used too much cleaner and not enough water. Food was so good that I won't hesitate to go back!"}
{"text":"BEST BURGERS EVER. All yelpers need to taste this place.   Positives: Nothing BUT positives to say about this place. Oh my goodness you will not be let down if you go here. Even if like me, you had to make a drive to do so.  This place has loads of burgers as well as new specials all the time!!  Do not let the looks of this place fool you.. Outside it doesn't look like much. Inside? HEAVEN.   I got the brûlée burger. I highly suggest this!!!! I did not get the egg on mine but hubby did. We both loved what we got!  You will quickly notice the regulars popping in one after another. Not hard to get a seat but it is definitely busy.  They have a HUGE selection of drinks as well as menu.  This place has goooood grub.  Fries have such a great flavor to them!!   Negatives: Are you kidding? That's a nope."}
{"text":"Damn good burger!  Was visiting from California and seen so many great reviews, just had to check it out as we were craving a burger and fries. Glad we came in, we will definitely be back as we have moved to Arizona!  The shake wasn't as good as sadly, but again, the food was GREAT!"}
{"text":"Don't want to visit too many chains on my travels.  Was interested in a burger and the first place Yelp took me to was closed, so this place popped up.  Honestly, when I pulled up, I thought about leaving, and actually started to drive away, but my insides were telling me to give it a try.  Was immediately greeted by the counter staff.  They clearly explained the menu and made suggestions.  I took them up on their burger suggestion, and was pleased I did.   Also had their BBQ chips, which were A+.  Did see done people get the tutor tots, which looked yummy too.  Interesting flavors on shakes, but I stuck with a standard strawberry."}
{"text":"Might be a little pricey for the type of restaurant, but the food is well worth it. Especially the lucky charm shake if you have a sweet tooth! My only complaint was I didn't know the burger came with the onions on it, but easy fix I just took them off. The fries were great too. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I thought I reviewed this places eons ago and just realized I hadn't, so here goes.  This review is much deserved and long overdue.  I've been here about 10 times in the past year or so.  The owners are both there all the time and very cool.  They care about their customers and putting out a great tasting burger.  I always opt for the Paradise Bacon burger and it's never been anything but great.  The fries are also very good."}
{"text":"Went to paradise valley burger because it was featured on a food/ restaurant show.  Burgers were good but not the best I've had. The star of the dish were actually the pickled onions.  They also took quite a bit of time to bring us the food.  All in all we enjoyed the meal but will not go back very often."}
{"text":"Good food good people !!love it here. Refills are free and the fries are fantastic. Really close to where I live. Nice place to take the family after a game. Taste is always the same."}
{"text":"We went here tonight for the first time on a whim and we will definitively will be going back. So what sets this apart from other burger places besides the GREAT service? The pickled onions totally made the burger spectacular. And lets not forget about the sweet potato tater totes. Since the kids ate their burger and tacos in minutes, we agreed to allow them to have a milkshake which were awesome too. When we left, the kids asked when we can go back there again and we agreed we would come back soon even though it is a little of a drive for us!!"}
{"text":"The Beach House is awesome.  Eat ASAP for optimum enjoyment.  The seasoned fries are excellent."}
{"text":"Let me start with...  if your a big eater your not going to be happy. You might be better served to go get a Whopper @ the Burger King in the same parking lot. If you like the burger to be thick and juicy... not going to find it here.   Now if you want a flavor party this is a different story. The beach house burger has mega flavor. The green chili sends it to the next level.    The Texas burger claims to be bbq...no bbq sauce. Good but what I had envisioned came up short.  Also, it was supposed to have a creamy coleslaw...I think that the chef waved the spoon over the burger and we might have gotten a few pieces of the cabbage and dressing.   The seasoned french fries were good. A hint of sugar in the seasoning.   The sweet potatoe tots are ok.    Overall a little pricey for what you get.    Cool tunes playing.  Friendly staff.   I would like to say I would travel to come back, but sadly mo."}
{"text":"This wasn't my first experience at PVBC, but it was my best, by far.   I go in, I order the week's special - The New Year's Fail-solution Burger - 2 patties with havarti cheese, chiles, carmelized onions, cinnamon(what?), a maple/bacon/whiskey pesto on a fried brioche bun. I sit down with my Dr. Pepper, and soon enough I begin to smell things from the kitchen. I really hope whatever I smell is mine, because it smells amazing. I smell all the flavors of the cinnamon, the chiles, the carmelized onions and that's when I realized I was so hungry I'd drank half my Dr. Pepper. My mouth was watering at this point. The food comes out and it exceeds my already high expectations. The cinnamon blew my mind. I had no idea using cinnamon in a burger could be so delicious...and don't even get me started on that pesto...that stuff is ridiculous in a very good way. This was the best burger I've ever had. Also try the regular seasoned fries and the sweet potato tots...either will be a great decision.   Other burgers you should definitely try - the Brûlée Burger, the Country Fried Burger, and the Booze Burger. The Booze is by far my favorite at this point - 2 deep fried patties on a brioche bun with a vodka/green chile/bacon cream sauce that will blow your mind. It's topped with smoked Fresno chiles that take it to another level. This is my go-to when I come to PVBC, however I will always wish/hope they bring back that special of the week that I dream about.   Paradise Valley Burger Co. has become my favorite spot to eat, and if you have not tried it you are missing out big time."}
{"text":"What is there to say about this place that hasn't already been said? My wife and I tried Paradise Valley Burger Co last night after a coworker recommended it! This place is a hidden gem! I cannot wait to go back there again! I had the Burger Brulee while my wife had the Beach a House. We split an order of sweet potato tots as well as a Lucky Charms milkshake for desert. Words cannot describe how delicious this place is! I highly recommend checking out PVBC!"}
{"text":"I got the sloppy joe on a bun and it had the perfect kick. One the best sloppy joes Ive ever had. Next time im going to try the burger. Nice little joint nestled near the paradise valley hospital. Great staff and very friendly"}
{"text":"Great food, sweet tasting fries. The burger is reminiscent of summer BBQs. Tastes homemade!   Appreciated the service. Skater guys providing descent customer service... Can't beat that.   I wish this place was larger! Inside is pretty small and the place was packed!   Overall, great place to go to with friends for lunch or a quick dinner!"}
{"text":"I had the beach house burger with Cole slaw. It was very good although a bit small for the price. I also had the sweet potatoe toys which were delicious. I took a vote of my daughter's pulled pork and it was amazing. Overall a great place to eat but a bit cramped if your with a group, particularly during peak hours."}
{"text":"This burger joint doesn't look like much from the outside, but it is amazing! The customer service was excellent. The girl who took my order was very friendly, someone came and delivered my food, and someone even came to my table to see how my food was.   The Paradise ChZ comes with your choice of cheddar, moz, or havarti. I went with havarti. It was delicious! The burger was fresh, good size, and had great flavor. The fries were a little over seasoned for my liking, but they were still really good. I was extremely happy with the entire experience and can't wait to go back and try the vegetarian sandwich & the green chili burger."}
{"text":"French. Toast. Fries!  Amazing.  Worth every second of the wait and even the semi-odd customer base that was in the venue.    This place has been bookmarked on my Yelp account for almost 4 months, and it's only a 5 minute drive from our place, so that's just sad really.  Now that we know how delicious the burgers are, we will be heading there more often!    I had the Sloppy Joe on white toast any my fiancee had the Bacon Cheeseburger.  We ordered some regular fries and, of course, some of the much talked about French Toast Fries.  Both were delicious, but the french toast ones were amazingly decadent and tasted like a dessert.  All in all a great visit and we will be returning without doubt.  Overall: A"}
{"text":"Delicious little place where everything was a bit... sweet? Ordered the paradise cheeseburger and seasoned fries. Super tasty, but everything tasted like it was sprinkled with a good bit of sugar. Loved the picked onion condiments and heavy amount of sauce.  All in all, this is a terrible place for a diet but a great place for unique burger."}
{"text":"I am so glad we paid a visit to this cute, chill restaurant. I wasn't in the mood to go to a trendy, hipster restaurant where you're there to see and be seen.... And this was definitely the best spot! We came around 5p on a Saturday and the place wasn't busy. We walked in to the counter and the guy asks us if we've been in before. He was pretty laid back. We ordered the creme brûlée burger, seasoned fries, sweet potato tater tots and a peanut butter milkshake.   The burger was average portion, but it was so good! The fries were good, but not anything better than I've had before and.. the milkshake - let's just say \"it brings all the boys to the yard\"! Ha   The best things about this place: quick and the inexpensive bill!!!"}
{"text":"I realize this is a order at the counter type of place and not fine dining, but the place was a mess. Every table was dirty, trash was overflowing onto the floor. At one point the person working the register walked over pushed the trash down with his hand and went back to work (no hand washing going on there).  I had a cheeseburger with the homemade BBQ chips. Everything was beyond salty. I think the lid from the salt shaker must have come off while preparing my food. Sadly, I was not the lease bit impressed. I REALLY wanted to love this place since it's in my neighborhood.  On another note, I must be missing something about this place. At one point the line to order was about 20 deep, so maybe it was just a timing fluke on my part."}
{"text":"Ok place. Staff is friendly and not snobby as some places are around this location. Great fries (I normally don't eat them but the sever insisted)  I'm glad she did!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this while i was in the area and  cant wait to go back! Its a small joint, nothing fancy, and amazing food!!!! All types of sandwiches. We had the burgers and they were amazing."}
{"text":"Best kept secret around town...Place is a dive in a shady business complex and the burgers are soooo good!!  I will send eveyone I know there."}
{"text":"my hubby work near by so he eats lunch there a lot. very good burgers. lots of choices and everything comes out pretty quick"}
{"text":"GO, GO and GO again!!! Stopped in for lunch and was blown away by the creativity of the menu, the sincerity of service, and the humble nature of this charming joint.  I'm not from the area but if I was this would be my go-to for a burger that always exceeded expectation."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on Yelp scores and it did not disappoint.  The service and food was great especially for the price.  The best tasting burger is still the Fez burger for me but its also $13.  I would say this place has the best tasting burger and sides for the dollar.   The fries were great especially the white dipping sauce I wanted to steal about 20 containers of it. The french toast fries were really good My burger, the spicy whatever the hell its called was awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers with new & original twists and recipes every week....swift and friendly service....one of the best shakes I have ever had in their maple bacon pecan shake ...sweet potato tater tots there are the only fried sweet potato item I will eat (everywhere else that does SP fries and such, I really ca't stand)...and Sriracha at every table? What more can you ask for?  I give this place a 4 instead of a 5 because the first thing I tried there, I wasn't a fan of. I wouldn't suggest the country fried burger...it's not like a chicken fried steak on a bun like a thought it'd be; it was lightly dusted in flour then grilled on the skillet, also supposed to have fried onions, where I thought I was getting something like French's, it instead was blackened onion sprouts on the grill, and I wasn't a huge fan of those...it WASN'T TERRIBLE, but also not was I was expecting, and that wasn't a good thing in this instance. If what I described is your thing, then it's another thing to make you fall in love with this place. I've been here 3 or 4 times.  Everything else, however, was top notch, and I would always recommend this place to a fellow burger lover."}
{"text":"We ordered the lucky charms milk shake, paradise burger, booze burger, and country-fried burger.    Paradise burger (with cheese) is a pretty basic burger.  Still really good, but it's hard to compare with an In-n-out burger.  I like how there's less bun and more grease (delicious).    Booze burger is a smart original burger--- 2? beef patties beer battered and fried, smothered with a green chili/vodka/bacon cream sauce. Topped off with smoked fresno chilis pickled in whiskey.    Country fried burger ---imagine a country fried steak, but with beef patty and similar toppings of a paradise burger.  It is definitely deep fried.  Lucky charm shake is vanilla shake with lucky charms, nothing too interesting.    Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"So, I went to this place a while back. It's the bomb! Have been meaning to write a review, and then was reminded to when a friend of mine called me to thank me for referring them there. I cannot think of a place that I have had a better burger at. Seriously. I totally wish it was closer! A true gem! :)"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. The sweets potato tots with some ketchup/Sriracha are amazing. The Beachhouse Burger is my go to. Also, they are now at Chase Field. Burgers and ballgames... a great combo."}
{"text":"I love this place, I have purposely gone out of my way to take my boyfriend and my mom here since the first time I've gone and they both love it as well.   My friend brought me here and I was skeptical at first because being from Texas makes me a very picky burger eater.   I loved it. I got the Burger Brulee without onion and it was AMAZING. The burger itself was so juicy and the burnt sugar with the egg was a perfect balance of flavor without being overpowering. I also shared an order of fries with my friend and they were so good with their jalapeno sauce! If you like burgers this is definitely the place to try."}
{"text":"PV Burger is the best burger joint I've been to in years. Always thinking outside the box to create new and extraordinary burgers. The sweet tots and the franch toast fries are fantastic. This little gem is bound to blow up. Def check it out."}
{"text":"Thank you Diner, Drive-in and Dives for this amazing find!! By far one of the best burgers we've had! So many flavors my taste buds couldn't keep up!! Let's start with the amazing fries and the seasoning on them, one word...YUMMY! We could eat those fries all day! We tried the chicken fried burger and the Paradise bacon cheeseburger. The fresh produce  made all the difference in flavor from other burgers. The caramelized onions on the chicken fried burger was to die for, crispy and delicious! Loved the Paradise bacon cheeseburger, super flavorful. I regret not trying the corn on the cob, it looked amazing! -next time, because there will most definitely be a next time!   Oh, and not to mention service! EXCELLENT service.  The atmosphere was so inviting and service just made it that much better of an experience for us! I cannot wait to be in Arizona again just to come back and try the entire menu!"}
{"text":"mediocre burger, place is a little \"dive-y\", in an icky part of town...there's much better burger places in town with ambience and better service."}
{"text":"First impressions mean a lot and finding this place lacking in interior design or a welcoming outdoor, speaks in volumes.  What you get is a great gourmet burger at a high price. For the prices they charge they also need to do a better job of cleaning. Homemade chips were NOT all that good and BBQ which I hate in a chip. Didn't know that and since the fryer was down and we couldn't get fries, we were \"offered\" chips which I thought would be free for the inconvenience. They weren't free and 2 burgers, fries and shakes with tip was a whopping $30.00. For that price I want ambience!"}
{"text":"I'd give them 5 stars because I really dig the burgers, but the greasy floors are bad. Last two times I went in there, the floor was way too slippery and you can tell it's because they are using a greasy mop in the dining area. A little skill with a mop goes a long way. Figure it out please, I wanna come back but it's kinda gross. Here's a tip. Have two mops. Use one in the kitchen and the other one in the dining area. Don't use the same water. Bam, problem solved.  I came back and got a burger last week and the floors were better.  -JC 6/12/2015"}
{"text":"This unassuming burger joint in tucked away in a strip mall. Don't let the exterior fool you! It is truly a gem.   From the second you walk in the door and rockabilly music hits your ears you are greeted by smiling faces of some of the friendliest staff members I have encountered in this town.  I ordered the Texas Burger and an order of their seasoned fries. The burger consisted of two patties cooked to perfection, a creamy slaw, fried green chiles, smoked shredded mozzarella, and tender bacon.   The fries were golden brown with a nice crunch in each bite. The seasoning clearly had a touch of sugary sweetness which added to the overall taste in a wonderful way.  There literally wasn't a single bite I didn't enjoy fully. As I took my last bite of burger I was filled with a combination of satisfaction and sadness that it was over so soon.   I will be back whenever I am looking for a burger that comes out quick and leaves me happy."}
{"text":"Ill make this short and to the point:  Service was mostly good until my husband had to chase our food because the server ran off with it.   Location: Quaint little spot in a shopping center with lots of parking. Not great for large parties in my opinion. But perfect for a quick bite.   Food: we ordered a bbg buger, the brulee burger, sweet potato tots, and french fries topped with the pulled pork and some special sauce. Bugers were good, but would probably add another patty because they are in & out thin in my opinion. Otherwise very tasty tho. I enjoyed the gourmet twist on the brulee. Def not ur tipical burger. Tots were tasty but if I was to come back id skip on the tots and just do the loaded fries with the pork (can't remember the name). Basically, i prob would come bck just for that if I was in the area.   Would I recommend: Sure! If not for the burgers the loaded fries are a must."}
{"text":"A really good burger joint. I came here for the first time and I was immediately overwhelmed by the menu options. With a little guidance I ordered the Cinco Diablo burger and Cardinal Fries. The bun was perfectly toasted, the burger was crisp yet moist and the toppings on my burger were excellent. The cardinal fries have delicious pulled pork on them, cheese, and a gravy concoction that goes well with everything. I look forward to exploring the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I'll be dreaming about this place until I go back. You know it's good when you already know what you want to order next time LOL. It's a dive, duh,  but the food is exactly what you want when you're craving a big ass gourmet juicy flavorful fun burger. The girl was so nice and made me CHICKEN AND WAFFLE FRIES. So run, don't walk because they are the greatest fries I've ever had and I consider myself a connoisseur. Okay also, I got the guy fieri burger (this place was on DDD) and it was good but it was a LOT of food. My friend got the brûlée burger and I can't wait to get my hands on it. They also have their own flavored ranches. NEED I SAY MORE? I'm in love! Oh also, they have a sister pizza place next door which I am also dying to try. Come here and you'll be HOOKED!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, very friendly staff, a bit overpriced for the size. But I'd go back"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. The shakes are wayyy overpriced. Definitely a delicious 'hole in the wall' joint."}
{"text":"How good is place that I order a burger that I shouldn't have ( brûlée  BS) and it was STILL good. Way too sweet for me BUT the party and bun were so good it saved the burger. Looking forward to going back"}
{"text":"I loved the food here! The wait was kind of long and the place is tiny, but the food is so worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I've tried their Brulee Burger before and it wasn't that good. But, now it's different, every bite is enchanting. The entire dishes had been upgraded into ultimate level of deliciousness. I never expected these big changes from this establishment."}
{"text":"SO good! We went for the first time about a month ago and we've been back 3 times since! It's a tiny little place with really nice people and REALLY great food! It's fresh and delicious. My (current) favorite is the Sloppy Joe. If I wasn't already a tad on the fatty fat-fat-fat side I'd be eating there every day. Also, if you get fries (which are amazing) and they offer you ranch on the side- TAKE IT, IT IS THE BEST RANCH OF ALL TIME."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had!  Seriously!  The brûlée burger is unbelievable!  They flame toast sugar onto the house made buns!"}
{"text":"Tiny tiny location, but amazing burger!! The bun, the burger, the toppings!!! Oh my!!! So fresh!  Cooked to perfection!  Service was great, we went on a Sunday afternoon and there was a steady flow of customers. Our burgers came to us quickly and were some of the best we've ever had! Hubby ordered fries and it was a large enough serving for both of us. The fries were seasoned and they were awesome!  We will recommend this place to anyone craving a delicious, unique burger!!"}
{"text":"Perfect stop for my family of four! Everything we have ordered has been wonderful. Their standard menu offers great selections, but their specialty burgers are (usually) even better! I would recommend following them on Instagram so that you can see photos of everything, including the weekly specials. Order a shake and a side of fries, it really completes the meal."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! I've been here on a regular basis for the last 6 months and each time I get something new and it's all amazing! My mom lives out of state and now has to stop by at least once on her trip to eat a burger."}
{"text":"So good!  My friends come down from Show Low and this is where they want to have dinner!  It's a little hole in the wall, but you totally won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall place, but it's surprising how amazing it is. It tastes like a home-made sandwich, and the flavors they have are nothing i'd ever seen before. You'll never have anything like it again."}
{"text":"At first glance the place seemed a little dumpy bit the food and service more than made up for it.  Everything made fresh to order.  Probably one of the best burgers I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"Had the Brûlée burger. Excellent burger!  Sweet potato tots were good. Next time I will try the carnival corn. Service was slow, but we went during a busy time. The restaurant leaves a lot to be desired as far as ambiance, but the food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"this place is so much fun! incredible food, amazing music, and a fun, refreshing atmosphere. the owner is the coolest dude ever, which is a nice cherry on top! all of his burgers are killer, i also highly recommend the sweet potato tots, the jalapeno aoli and the lucky charms milkshake!"}
{"text":"Called at 7:55 when they close at 8 and they let me order take out. So awesome thanks guys. Had been looking forward to the meal all week. Amazing as always"}
{"text":"So amazingly delicious! The burgers were perfectly cooked on a neat square shaped bun with all the fixings which includes pickled onions. The sweet potato tater tots were so yummy especially dipped in their homemade ranch dressing! The homemade chips are a must and even the regular fries were great! The staff was very chill and very friendly and the food came out super quick and hot! Def a must!!!!"}
{"text":"YUMMMMM! I love burgers and I love bacon and I love bacon burgers!   My bacon burger was to die for, as were the fries! While we waited for our food, we got a maple bacon milk shake that was THE BOMB!   Everything was perfectly made, and quite frankly, effing delicious."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes to Paradise Valley Burger Company!   Went in for the first time on a Saturday night. The place was packed and the line was long - luckily it was nice out and we snagged a table outside. While we were waiting for our burgers someone from their new pizza place next door brought us some pizza samples - it was really good. But this is about the burgers...  I got the brulee burger. OMG. I can see why this is a signature item for them. It's hard to find a really unique burger but I've never had anything like this before. It's a juicy burger with cheese, an egg, sauce, and then they brulee the inside of the bun so it's sweet and a little crispy like crème brulee. I can know understand why a donut burger is a thing because the flavor combination is perfect. Salty, sweet, meaty, eggy, woah. It got all over my hands and I didn't care, this burger was fantastic.  Easily on the top of the list for best burgers in town if not best burgers anywhere."}
{"text":"Today was my 2nd visit and must say was just as impressed as I was a month ago. Staff is friendly and helpful - explained things well when I asked several questions.   All burgers come complete with 2 patties and are very filling. Sweet potato tater tots are delicious!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for jobs close to this place!!!  Seriously...the best burgers in the Valley.  I mean who doesn't want a burger with a fried egg, burnt sugar AND bacon???  I also love that the owner rings you up and is completely engaged with his customers.  Staff rocks and the shakes are killer!!"}
{"text":"Love the weekly changes to the menu I always enjoy not eating the same old thing presented in the same old way so to have a place like this is nice especially since the quality is good as well"}
{"text":"Paradise Valley burger company is a hidden paradise for a great burger.Great contrast of ingredients A skilled chef create a delicious looking burger and wonderful blast to the pallet. A wonderful treat for hamburger lovers.A treat that everybody should try."}
{"text":"Great burger and fries for the money. Had a basic cheese burger and it was amazing.   The place seemed a bit dirty not horrible but they could use some help cleaning up."}
{"text":"So, I'm not a big burger gal, but the guy I WAS seeing does like a good burger.  That said, I am so glad we paid a visit to this cute, kick back restaurant. I wasn't in the mood to go out and get dolled up... so Paradise it was!   We came around 5p on a Saturday and the place wasn't too busy, mind you it was pre dinner rush.  We ordered the creme brûlée burger, seasoned fries, sweet potato tater tots and a peanut butter milkshake - based on another Yelp review.   The burger was medium sized, but it was so tasty/good! The fries were good, but not anything out of the ordinary, just good fries.  The milkshake was extraordinary.   The best milkshake/burger combo around!"}
{"text":"UNREAL CHOCOLATE MALT SHAKE.  Better than the burger.  I had the Beach House Burger: roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella, and pico de gallo.  It could have used avocado and some jalapenos, which are available but I didn't get them.  Everyone talks about the brulle burger, but I don't eat pork, so the bacon thing didn't work for me.  But back to the pièce de résistance: the chocolate malt shake.  An unexpected treat and a pleasant surprise.  Make sure you get the 'malt' and not the 'shake'.  If you're into shakes/malts like I am, you won't regret this one.    The owners are super chill and have a good personality as well."}
{"text":"Extremely unique and unbelievable flavor! You will never get tired of the menu new special burger creation every week!!! Something for everyone. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Phoenix ! Love this place. Me and my wife have been coming here for years and we have never left disappointed. Not a bad burger on the menu !"}
{"text":"Amazing menu!  I had burger brûlée (burnt sugar on a burger!  Holy moly!), French toast fries, and a maple/pecan/bacon milkshake for dessert, and it was all hands-down amazing!  Super nice staff, quick service, really decent prices.  Definitely going back to this little diner!"}
{"text":"Great food!  The fries are to die for, delicious sweet/spicy flavor on them.  The milkshake (I had peanut butter and chocolate), awesome! The burger patty, alone is under seasoned and thin which is why I gave 4 stars.  However, in the burger, it's delicious!  I had the bbq burger, and added fried onions (which went perfectly on it). My only complaint on the burger as a whole, was not enough bbq sauce.  Great place, the man who took my order was patient, kind, and very knowledgable about the food.  The service felt a little slow, but it's cooked to order and at lunch they are busy, so I didn't mind.  The man who brought out my burger was nice, and checked back to make sure I didn't need anything as well.  Warning: Limited seating!"}
{"text":"While we rarely consider Burgers joints, we happened to stop by this one  while visiting Phoenix.  WOW!  Completely surprised.  Such a creative use of unexpected ingredients.  A great surprise for our taste buds, and a great 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers, great shakes, and very friendly and helpful staff! I tried the Booze Burger it was very flavorful, beer breaded patties, piled high with topping and on a thin yet solid bun."}
{"text":"Very good burgers!!! I'm happy to see another local business succeed. Looking forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me with this place?! IT IS SO AMAZING! Their burgers and fries are to die for. Everyone needs to try Paradise Valley Burger at least once...you will be back."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and I love the vibe. Barbecue blueberry bacon burger with jalapeño with the most amazing fries, a little sweet flavor on them."}
{"text":"I had the veggie tacos, one each way, and the sweet potato tater tots. The veggie tacos were some of the best street tacos I've ever had. The mushrooms were smoky, but the Fresno topping really played well together! (Yeah, I know, bacon on a veggie taco - but, BACON!) The sweet potato tater tots were just sublime. Not the least bit greasy but nice and crispy - this alone is a major accomplishment! The tots themselves were perfectly cooked. Not the least bit mushy, and they even had a faint bite to the bits for some texture. They were AMAZING.  I wish I lived here. I'd be back to try ALL the things!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's small, cute, and has good food. I just moved to Paradise Valley and was looking for cheap eats that are yummy. This is the place.   I had the Paradise Burger with Cheese and Jalapeno Ranch... so good... and the Carnival Corn. I recommend. I loved it. Will be going back."}
{"text":"This place was great! My favorite part, hands down, was the seasoned fries. Yes, I know this is a burger place known for burgers, but the fries were the part I enjoyed the most. The price was a little high to get a burger, fries and a drink, but the meal was good. I had the Bruleé Burger and it was very unique. Everything worked so well together, and the bruleé on the bun was a great touch and not overpowering. It added an interesting texture and sweetness. The fries though were the star. No need for any sauce, the seasoned fries by themselves were perfect - sweet, salty, delicious. Rating 3 stars because the price was a little higher than I feel it should have been."}
{"text":"Just had my first meal at Paradise Valley Burger after hearing all the hype about it. The hype is real. So good!! I had the beach burger (I believe), and holy smokes, so amazing!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"DDD Destination.  \"Dang man this burger is good\" as i sat and stared into my Brûlée Burger. ill be fair. any burger with an egg is cheating. cuz it will make it 10x juicier. and i just came into town from LA and came directly here before heading out to watch spring training baseball. i was hungry and was gonna go watch me some dodger baseball! Hunger + Outing = Helps to make a Burger taste good. potato fries hit the spot too.   The Brûlée Burger. Just get it!!!"}
{"text":"The creativity alone for the weekly specials makes Paradise Valley Burger Company one of the best places to get a quality burger."}
{"text":"I cant say I was impressed at all. The burgers were small and the sweet potato tots were al dente in the middle. The burgers had good flavor, but for $25 for two small burgers two sides and one shake and one flat soda, it was unimpressive. Probably would not go back."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Saw it on diners drive ins and dives. The burgers were good. Reasonably priced. Can be crowded sometimes but worth it."}
{"text":"I've been craving this place all day today but trying to reduce my visits here down to like only 3-4 days a week.  Instead of going in, I'll give them a great review.    This place is seriously the bomb diggity of burgers!  If you are looking for a boring burger with the boring traditional condiments then go to a drive thru burger place and enjoy your mediocre life.  This place is where you go when you want an orgasm with every burger.  Not really but that would be super cool!    Every week they have a fun new burger to try out and it is always a concoction of weird things that when put together taste amazing.  On the \"normal\" menu they have some fun options too.  My favorite is the booze burger, which has beer battered fried burger patties... who the hell does that?  This place does and it tastes awesome!  It has all sorts of other yummy stuff too.  Their fries are super yummy and have a bit of sweetness to them.  Make sure you try their jalapeño ranch because it is freaking tits!  Sweet fries dipped in spicy ranch is sooo good.  As others have mentioned, their French toast fries are Hella good.    This place isn't your trendy gourmet burger restaurant that you often see around here.  This has the \"hole in the wall\" feel with super nice bearded (good looking) guys working.    Crap, now that I just wrote this review I want to eat here more than ever.  I am going to try to have self control and not go tonight but I can pretty much guarantee I'll be going tomorrow for lunch."}
{"text":"The actual meat is good , I had the PV bacon and cheese and I just felt like there was to many ingredients to actually enjoy the actual burger , it wasn't the best I've had or the worst ... Also tried an order of the Cardinal fries which I thought were way better thank the burger ... I'd come here again and probably try just a simple cheese burger and fries of course but I wouldn't rave about this place to my friends .. Kinda disappointed that this was a Diners Dive and Drives spot that Guy Fieri visited , I've been to a bunch of his stops and this is probably bottom of my list of good :("}
{"text":"This place was bomb. I got the burger brûlée it was so many good flavored combined together. My favorite part was the burnt sugar on the bun omg it was so good! Also I got the sweet potato tater tots with jalapeño ranch. And my husband got the baklava (not sure if I spelt that right) shake and that was really good! You could taste the honey in there and it wasn't to sweet so you can actually drink the whole thing and enjoy it. Basically this place is a must go. Glad we went."}
{"text":"First time visit.  The menu was limited compared to what I saw of the pictures of a variety of burgers.  When I asked for the corn slaw and a few different burgers, I was told they were specials and they changed them every week so not available on a regular basis.  Had the classic burger which was prepared as requested and tasty.  Also had the sweet potato tots and they were too sweet for my liking.  Overall, if I were in the area I'd stop in but I won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. I got the Country Fried Burger and fries. So amazing! I live in California and would consider taking a trip back to Arizona for this place. One of my new favorites."}
{"text":"I love PVBC.... Best burger in-town is easily the Brulee.  I was so hesitant when it came to ordering this. It sounds odd and scary, but it is mouth-gasmic.  They layer the burger so beautifully and hats off to making not only a mouth watering burger, but an appealing mouth watering burger.  The brulee activated all my tastebuds (except the sour and bitter). I had the sweet, the salty/savory, a smokey flavor from bacon, a delicious fried egg bursting all over the burger patty, Sweet onions...and wait..yes the SWEET SWEET and CRUNCHY brulee'd bun...  So i thought that was soo delicious then i spotted it...spiracha sauce...yes...I then decided to add this flavor to my burger...so imagine all that i mentioned before then a kick of hot spiciness. Low and behold i thought i knew what a mouth-gasm was before this time, but i truly mouth-gasm'ed from this burger.   My favorite burger place in town..YES it is true. PVBC has become that for me.  I've tried their other burgers since that fateful day, they are equally delicious, but not the mouth-gasmic powers of the brulee. I even tried the brulee with chicken breast...it was delicious and totally a different beast with that...but nothing compares to the orginal brulee burger...  sing with me: \"it feels like the first time!!! it feels like the very first time\""}
{"text":"Pig of Palermo.  Phenomenal.  We came here the first time for lunch and it was the best. We will definitely be heading back because there are 4 other burgers I NEED to try.  They have a few sauces that I tried, jalapeño ranch, spicy ketchup.. Yummmmmy :)"}
{"text":"Visiting family in Phoenix and wanted something Unique and tasty. It was worth the side trip."}
{"text":"We've visited Paradise Valley Burger Company on two separate occasions now. The only reason I'm holding back on giving it a perfect five stars, is because I want to try some of their other burgers to see how well they compare to what we've already sampled.  This burger joint is a complete hole-in-the-wall establishment. A truly local business that, rather than being part of some giant \"concept\" corporation, has been built from the ground up and has developed a massive following as a result.    In some ways, it's funny. Places like this usually don't exist in relatively dull suburban areas, but seem to be located more in local \"hot spots\" that are situated in downtown Phoenix, Scottsdale, or somewhere in Tempe. I think that's partly what makes it so refreshing and a reminder that good food can be found virtually anywhere if you're willing to take risks and go looking for it.  PVBC is very small. And very crowded. If you're looking to dine-in, this can sometimes be frustrating, because both times we visited, my girlfriend and I were afraid we wouldn't able to find a table. It doesn't help that many of the tables are situated to where you're forced to eat elbow-to-elbow with guests. But you know what? These things can easily be forgiven when your burgers are this good!  On both occasions, I've had the highly recommended Brulee burger, which is an extremely elaborate and unique concept burger that incorporates bacon, onion, burnt sugar, havarti, and my all-time favorite burger addition: the fried egg. The taste is a combination of both traditional and unique flavor, that makes for a superb result that is different - but not different enough to where I find it offensive. The Paradise CHZ is also excellent for those of you who are more traditionalists.    Seasoned fries, french toast fries, and pretzel fries, purchased on special, are all excellent and worth trying based on your mood. The Lucky Charms shake I ordered on my first visit is pretty much self-explanatory. It was good, but something that anyone can easily duplicate, so I can't really say I'd order it a second time.  Strangely enough, this place also has tacos. No one ever seems to get them and I'm curious how well they compare to the burgers.  After watching their piece on DDD and seeing all of the elaborate work that goes into these burgers, as well as their reasoning for the square bun, the 2-2oz patty approach, and the work that goes into the preparation, I feel that this place has to be visited multiple times to really be able to appreciate all of their creations. And that's why I intend to return more regularly to see what else they have to offer.  I'll say this: There are so many gourmet burger places opening up all over the city that are essentially all carbon copies of each other. They're all good, but they're all, dare I say - safe. This is one place that focuses more in innovative creations, which I find incredibly refreshing in the current food culture of Phoenix.  There's a reason why it's so popular.    Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I took my mom here for dinner because it was right down the road from where we live. From first impressions it was clearly a really popular spot. The food was really good and the wait time was pretty average. I would give this place 3.5 out of 5 stars if that was possible. Reason why my rating is somewhat low is because the only issue is regarding portion size. It's somewhat small for the price (in my personal opinion), and I didn't really understand why the meal didn't come with one side included. Each side I ordered was an additional $2 added to the meal. Other than that the quality of the food was great and the atmosphere was really chill and comfortable with the crowd."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here.  I had a Paradise Burger with cheddar plus fries with a side of their 1000 Island blend. The meal was fairly good but also pretty surprising.  In my every day diet I tend to stay away from sugar.  I have it once in a while as a cheat treat.  Because of not eating it often,  I can tell without a doubt when I taste it,  and I tasted plenty in this meal.  Apparently they like to use sugar to put a different spin on their items.  The fries were liberally sprinkled with a sugar salt blend,  and either the cucumber or onion (maybe both!) had been soaked in sugar water.  It seems like there was sugar in the bun, too,  but I can't be sure,  it may have been from something else.  Today happened to be a cheat day for me,  (hence burger and fries) so this meal wasn't really a problem for me,  but I won't eat here on any kind of a regular basis because of it. This must be their trademark taste and if you love sugar,  this may end up being a favorite of yours. The 1000 Island blend is tasty,  I recommend it. Since I didn't try the Taco Salad or any other items,  I can't say if they have sugar.   So,  all in all it was ok,  just know what you're ordering if you go there."}
{"text":"As seen on TV, this burger joint deserved that spotlight and my return visit!   The 1st time I ate here I just had to try the brulee burger...I know I know...with so many burger joints serving up burgers with burnt sugar and havarti with egg how does one choose who's the king in this highly saturated brulee burger market?  Ha!  Just kidding, this obviously isn't your typical Ronald McMoney scene, these are people who know food and service and love what they do.  When I try a new restaurant I usually try to limit toppings to test the true quality of the actual dish.  (They have a pizza place too in the same shopping center btw) I haven't had the pleasure of trying that pizza but if I did I'd have to try cheese first.  Wet toppings can ruin a crust real fast ...so on this trip I just got the burger with cheddar, bacon and BBQ sauce. That's about as plain as I can make a burger.  The bun was actually really good with just a hint of sweetness.  Didn't notice that the 1st time due to the burnt suger (yum) on the brulee burger.   meat: juicy and flavorful bun: soft, sweet very nice cheese : perfect half melt (see picture) service : with a smile!   Overall nice 5 star for an independent mom and pop joint so rare these days!"}
{"text":"Tasty food: no doubt! But the prices are high and the portions are small: bad combination. I finished their key burger and found myself still hungry."}
{"text":"Yummy gluten free buns to substitute on any burger. A real treat. Great side stop on your way down South or back up North."}
{"text":"I ate here once when I was in the area. I had a chicken sandwich smothered in cheese and onions, can't remember which one, but it was good!"}
{"text":"Tried this place again after a few years after personal recommendations. Still not at all impressed. Super dry bland patties, burned chili pepper, plain bun. At least the fries were pretty good, and it seems they have soft drinks now on tap.   Try zinburger if you want a fantastic burger."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  If you're looking for a high quality burger, look no further.  Don't let the humble surroundings fool you.  I had the Burger Brulee and can't wait to go back to get it again.   Kudos to this place."}
{"text":"Oh burger brulee. There are tons of burger places in Phoenix. This one, this one, I think it absolutely worth every cent and every bite!"}
{"text":"I have never tasted French fries seasoned like these. I was skeptical until I took my first bite. WOW! Amazing flavor and texture. My friends had burgers and one person had the taco salad. Everyone was satisfied with their meal. Don't let the outside or inside of the building fool you. They are serving top notch food. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Great Burgers! I had the Burger Brûlée & my husband had the Booze Burger (not on the menu), both were wonderful. The Brûlée was an excellent combination & not something I would have thought to put together. The little kick of crunchy sweetness was fantastic! The fries were also wonderfully seasoned & crispy, and the peanut butter shake was super tasty. Great service & they get people through the line very quickly. Lunch on Saturday was packed!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place a couple months back and I am now just getting around to reviewing it.  We tried the Brulee burgers which were FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC.  The two guys working the place were super busy but super nice.  I'm looking forward to dining there again."}
{"text":"Good, but not amazing. Small, super casual place, and very busy. I've had a better burger elsewhere, but this was solid. The sweet potato tots though.  OMG. I could have feasted on just those and been happy."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall with awesome, unique, fresh, overpriced burgers...More like fair food with their French toast fries. Sweet potato tater tots were good."}
{"text":"My husband and I saw Paradise Valley Burger on the Food Channel and had to stop in! The place was packed! We got lucky and scored some seats while waiting in line. The lady taking the order was really quick so the line moved at a good pace. My husband got the Burger Brûlée and I got the paradise burger with the sweet n spicy sauce. The paradise burger came with a cucumber which I found odd, but it was pretty good! The sauce was a nice touch. We were stuffed and satisfied when we were done with our lunch!!"}
{"text":"Creative, delicious and crazy.  Burgers are created by a mad scientist and are fantastic.  Only thing is it's a small place and it gets packed fast, come very early."}
{"text":"Excellent service (not just because we are tourists) AND food! Best fries we've ever eaten. Will definitely be back AND recommend."}
{"text":"Our new favorite burger joint.  The staff is casual (very casual), but the burgers are the best in town.  The prices are fantastic."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  BBQ burger, fries , grilled cheese, Tatar tots.  Everything was 5 stars! Will be back"}
{"text":"As they say never judge a book by its' cover.  Its' not a very posh place but the food is wonderful.  This is my new favorite burger place.  The food is delish, the service is friendly and the fries are soooo good also.  I have been told the milk shakes are wonderful also.  That will be the next thing I try.  You have to try it."}
{"text":"I'm moving out of North Phoenix, and the worst part about it is that I'm moving away from PVBC.  Great burger, salty fries, and mounds of creativity. Just walk in and order the special. Doesn't matter what's in it; just get it. It's good, even when you don't think it will be (e.g., a burger coated in ground up lucky charms!? Oh yes. Weird but so good.).  I'll be back. Definitely."}
{"text":"O M G Love this little place. Crazy, creative weekly specials that will blow your burger loving mind! I am a big fan of their brûlée burger, and frequently dream about them at night. The seasoned fries are especially tasty, and if you dip them in whatever aioli your burger came with, they are amazing."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently visited Arizona and had the opportunity to eat at PVBC. We both had the same reaction: BEST BURGER EVER!!! He had the Beach House Burger and I had the Burger Parmesana. I made the mistake of watching my caloric intake and missed out on the awesone toasted bun. The sides (french fries and tater tots) were equally as good. We told the owner (super nice guy)  that if he opens up in New York he could count on us to be regulars. If i were you I would definately check it out and make sure you dont make the same mistake that I did, HAVE THE BUN!!!!"}
{"text":"Came her based on Yelp reviews while in town for a conference. Delicious!! The brûlée burger was insane, and the sweet potato tots were a perfect side. My son has the country fried burger and it must have been good, because I didn't even get to try it. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I thought I was being boring by ordering just a 'plain' cheeseburger and fries; however, the food was anything but that! The cheeseburger was delicious and had all kinds of yummy toppings: cucumbers, pickled radishes, a special sauce, and my choice of cheese. Even the bun was delish! The fries were seasoned perfectly as well. I think I ate every single bite of my food. The staff was excellent-super fast and helpful. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone, and I can't wait to come back to Scottsdale for more! :)"}
{"text":"The absolute best burger I've ever had. Their specials are always so different & always so great. Don't let location turn you off. It's small, but they're quick & worth any line you'd have to stand in. Never disappointed & always took corporate, family & friends when they came to visit. Unfortunately I moved so I won't experience as much, but whenever I'm back in town it's a must! GO HERE NOW"}
{"text":"What a delicious burger. I have eaten here a couple of times and have always enjoyed it. The staff is extremely friendly and passionate about their restaurant.   I order the daily special and it was really good. My only hold back on this restaurant is the cost. $9.50 seems really expensive for a burger that left me still hungry and no fries   I'd come back here again but I wouldn't order the special."}
{"text":"I just love a place like this.  Paradise Valley Burger Company is what it is and isn't pretending to be anything else. It's a dive. There aren't \"modern\" tables and chairs and fancy lighting. There aren't servers (although a runner brings the food its ordered). There isn't some fancy fountain soda machine that looks like its from the future. It's simply a little joint that serves up unique and delicious burgers.  The workers there are great. The guy who took our order was pretty personable and left me under the impression that he loves the restaurant and the food that it serves. After telling us about some of the popular items, he recommended the Beach House as his personal favorite. Roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella, and pico de gall. That sounded great to me. That with the sweet potato tots are a great meal!  The menu is a pretty good size and there are weekly specials written on a wipe board. I'll certainly be back to try the rest."}
{"text":"Disappointed. The pictures and other \"raving\" reviews, I expected so much more. The Beach House burger was not very big and the sweet potato fries were greasy. Service was good, atmosphere to be desired. Maybe a second chance is in the future."}
{"text":"The burgers are definitely decent, but I felt the portion was a bit small. We got lettuce wraps instead of bread, which may have made the difference, but we were still hungry afterwards! The sweet potato tater tots were alright.   Friendly counter service, good location, but I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This really hurts to write.  Really.  It does.  I wanted so badly to love this place.  I really rely on and trust my fellow Yelper's opinions...in this instance, I'm really feeling betrayed.   I've wanted to come here FOREVER, and the day before my birthday (July 1), my friend wanted to take me to a quick dinner and let me choose.  I chose here without hesitation.   We arrived in the strip mall where PVBC is located and when we crossed over the threshold of the restaurant, I nearly fell and broke my neck on the greasy floor!  Thank god my friend was behind me and snatched me up or else I probably would have hurt myself.  I literally slid the whole way to the register where I grabbed a menu and began to look it over.  I chose the daily special (some \"Denver\" themed burger), and my friend got a standard burger.  We then slipped and slid across the greasy floor and attempted to find a clean table.  There weren't any.  I actually had to go grab napkins and go wet one in the ladies room so I could come back and wipe down the table we decided to sit at.   While waiting for our food to come out, I tried to look through the windows outside but they were cloudy and smeared with (you guessed it)...grease!  My friend and I both commented in unison just how disgusting the inside of the restaurant was.  Really...it was unbelievable.  I know that burgers and fries are greasy...I get that there is going to be residual grease throughout the place, especially because it's a super small space, but come on!   By the time our food arrived, I really wasn't hungry anymore but ate half of my burger anyway.  It was good but my stomach was not pleased an hour later. My friend also had some stomach \"discomfort\" when he got home.   For those of you who swear by this place, more power to you, but I just can't bring myself to ever return to a place like this.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Well reviewed place that lives up to the hype! Very creative offerings that are well done. I had the Beach Burger with homemade potato chips. Very tasty indeed. Compared to even the best drive through or chain, PV Burger dominates. Don't mind the long line snaking through the store, well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I found out about this place due to Diners, Drive In and Dives. I was excited to check it out as it looked delicious and not far from where I lived. I took my family who was visiting from out of town and they were just as excited as I was to try it. We went a week after the episode aired and had no idea our visit would turn out like it did. Although our food was great our experience made our food and trip not worth it. I understood that they had this wonderful exposure however we visited after lunch and the line to order was thirty minutes. There was no seating available to accommodate our party so we had to split up sitting across the hall from each other. Then we waited 45 minutes to get our food. I understood it was busy however people's to go orders (who ordered 30 minutes after I did) were being fulfilled before mine. The restaurant could use an upgrade as while I was waiting for my food, I waited at my table that consisted of lawn chairs. My party walked away not very happy with their experience. I would be happy to return to give it another chance; I would just wait until the hype dies down a little."}
{"text":"I was not disappointed.  The menu is simple, I like that.  We had the Beach House and the Brûlée burger.  The service  was spot on.  The food came out super fast.  The flavor was out of control.  A must try.  \"Eat Local!\""}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try a new local restaurant nearby, so we took to yelp for help. Paradise Burger Co. Had good reviews so we thought we'd give it a try. Sad to say we were disappointed. The hole-in-the-wall burger place did not live up to our expectations. When we got there we grabbed a menu to look it over. Apparently the place was on the Food Network show Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. They had two burgers that were featured on the show: country fried burger ($7.75) and the booze burger ($9), so we tried those and some fries($2.50). They don't carry fountain drinks either, only cans-so no refills. We ordered to-go and when we got home we were not impressed. The burgers were very small for the prices and the flavor wasn't so great either. The fries also had way too much seasoning for our liking. I don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious! The sweet potato tots are amazing. Loved the pickled onions on the burger. I will definetely be back to try new things on the menu. There are so many interesting options that its hard to decide!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!! The menu has a variety of options from burgers, sandwiches, salad to tacos! And leave room for dessert because they have some great options. The shake of the day was a pop tart shake which we didn't get to try but sounded so good.  I got the cinco de Diablo which I highly recommend. It has a battered poblano, two patties, bacon, and most delicious aioli of some sort. And can't forget the avocado and lettuce which both add a cool bite to the heat that is going on. The heat level I would say is medium. It doesn't pack a punch but it's sure full of flavor. I had the seasoned fries as a side and they were so yummy! Freshly made and seasoned to perfection.  The ambiance is great. Full of people enjoying good food. The line moves quickly and there was someone there picking up our food after we had finished. There was nothing left on our plate but dirty napkins.  The prices also can't be beat for the gourmet burger your receiving."}
{"text":"Really good burgers. They put effort in every step. The buns are grilled. The onions are pickled.  Mine had diced tomatoes. Did not stay on burger. All the burgers come with two patties. Very nice staff, we will become regulars at this place. The season fries are second to the jalapeño fries!."}
{"text":"Yum amazing was in love at first bite staff is awesome and made me feel right at home!"}
{"text":"Cute place.  Ate the pulled veggie sandwich and it was Fabulous!! That with the season fries and sweet potato tater tots made for a fabulous lunch !!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on the Food Network and since my wife and I were nearby, heck yeah we were going to stop in.  This place is no frills, simple menu. Burgers and a handful of other options.  They are known for the Brulee Burger. The concept is interesting.  The place was filthy though.  Staff was nice and patient.  Burgers were overhyped but a fun stop.  Less than desirable area."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall dive in seedy strip mall. Best and most creative burgers in town!!  I have been eating burgers for half a century, so trust me when I tell you that these are great burgers!!!"}
{"text":"First time at this establishment...I ordered the Country Gravy burger and would have to say that I have eaten better.  The bun had been flattened and very greasy.  This is my opinion and I will choose not to go back"}
{"text":"The beach house burger has fresh pico de Gallo, poblano, and smoked mozzarella. I had it with their fries which were seasoned in paprika and a rogue ingredient: sugar. At first I was a bit surprised with the sugar on the fries but just try it- it's a different flavor combo. I loved the burger, it was packed with flavor but wasn't heavy. The bread was buttery like a brioche and really complimented the burger. I love this place and I can't believe I just found it!"}
{"text":"I'm a first time customer and I have to say it was pretty damn tasty! Don't let the outside fool you- the neighborhood is so-so, but the burgers are delish. I had a basic bacon cheeseburger with pickles, chipotle ketchup and mustard - SO good. Messy, but the burger held together well. My husband had their 'special' burger of the day which was a concoction of beer battered bacon, green chiles, celery, blue cheese and fried onions. He loved it! We also ordered the seasoned french fries and dipped those puppies in the chipotle ketchup and it was perfect! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in a 40 miles radius! Saw these guys on TV and it was worth every moment. The burgers are so creative and complex... I love it. I was really blown away by the burgers these people make. Simply the best!"}
{"text":"Really amazing burger I had the bbq one and I'm pretty sure they forgot the bbq sauce on it. It was still an amazing burger I highly recommend it. I waited for takeout about 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Lots of burger places but this one has a really good char grill flavor. Worth a try. I have been back for more."}
{"text":"I was recommended to go here from a friend.  Realizing it was just down the street from me, I headed over.  It's a tiny little joint that is easily missed if you're not looking for it.   Ordered their creme brulet burger and wow was it yummy.  If I had anything to say, I would say the meat could be a little more seasoned. Still great though!  I'd love to try a different burger next time just to try a variety.  One thing that blew me away was their french fries with BBQ seasoning on it.  Delish!  Good service and pretty quick too."}
{"text":"Unimpressed. My burger was tiny, like it was made on a small King's Hawaiin roll. Wasn't even good."}
{"text":"Nike it up with the Brulee Burger.  JUST DO IT.  Seriously.  It's amazing.  The patty was crisp on both sides yet the meat was not overdone.  I asked for the egg that comes on top to be a little more well, yet the egg wasn't dry and the yolk still smeared serving it's purpose.  The bacon was actually crispy and didn't overpower the rest of the ingredients (as bacon sometimes does).  The pink sauce that comes on it - killer - as well as the sweet pickled (?) red onions.  The bun was actually tasty on its own (rare for bread to shine!) and perfectly complimented everything - it was crispy (buttered + sugared, perhaps?).  UGH.  It was so good I can't stand it!  The flavor combo was heaven in my mouth.  I can't.  My friend got the Beach House Burger and liked mine better.  But he said if he didn't taste mine, he would've been amazed by his.  We also split the Country Fried Burger.  Yes, that's right.  As in, we had our own burger AND split another, along with a side of Sweet Potato Tots.  The Country Fried Burger was disappointingly dry, but we also forgot to smother it with the accompanying sauce - a bleu cheesy ranchy type sauce (?).  The fried onions that came atop were to die for - perfectly seasoned and salty, mmm.  The Sweet Potato Tots tasted fresh and were good.  Not sure if I would order again my next visit since I'd rather save room for more burger goodness (perhaps a double Brulee Burger) as well as the fact that I'd want to try their regular Fries AND their famous French Toast Fries.  Decisions, decisions...  ... Oh, that Brulee Burger.  I want it again and again and again.  P.S. Customer service was excellent with one guy behind the counter and the owner was present.  'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time Friday.  I got the Paradise Burger.  I asked for pickles to be added instead of cucumber (cucumber on a burger?) The food came out fast, within about 5 minutes of ordering which I like.  The first thing I noticed is they did not give me any pickles but did indeed give me cucumber.   I was in a hurry so didn't bother asking for pickles a second time.  The burger itself was very good and I would go back again to eat.  The fries were also good but way way way too much seasoning.  So much in fact that I had to wipe the excess seasoning off my fingers after every bite.  They could easily use 50% less than what I had on my fries.  I don't know if this is normal for them or just a fluke over seasoning.  When I do go back again I will indeed insist on getting pickles instead of cucumber and will ask for a \"normal\" amount of seasoning on the fries. Almost forgot,  loved the bun.  Very soft and wish more places used these buns!"}
{"text":"Very good burger combos & a decent, competitive prices. The seasoned fries and Beach House burger were quite yummy."}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees, their burgers are unique & delicious for a good price & dont even get me started with their fries, hot damn!! Pair it up with the jalapeño ranch & youve got yourself one tasty meal! Love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  If you are looking for a great burger this is the spot!  They have a great menu which have specialty and unique burgers or a build it yourself burger menu that is really good.  I work in the area and have already gone there twice in the same week.  This place is my new favorite!"}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood spot!  Checked this place out for the first time tonight after hearing about it from a friend.  It is a small place with a Mom n Pop feel.  We tried the Bacon Paradise Burger - delicious, fresh, and very reasonably priced.  The jalapeno ranch was tasty.  We also tried the Brulee burger which had a fried egg and burnt sugar on it - was alright, not my favorite.  The french fries are seasoned and done well.  Overall, a great experience and a refreshing type of place for this area.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great burger, had the Texas BBQ and it was amazing. Also had a side of sweet potato tots, really good combo with burger!!! I also have to tell you the service in this place is awesome!! Super friendly people and made me feel welcome."}
{"text":"Had a burger and substituted ground turkey. Not sure if the actual beef is all the rave, but overall this seems like an average burger joint. I wasn't overly impressed; however, wasn't disappointed. Good food, but not sure what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers with everything on it. The fries are seasoned to perfection. The shakes are the exact right consistency. All of the food at Paradise Valley Burger Company is top bar and wait is generally acceptable."}
{"text":"We LOVED this place. The cucumber on their burgers was genius. It gave it the perfect fresh taste. And I recommend adding Sriracha to your fries, that makes it even better. Which I didn't know was possible"}
{"text":"Went to this lil hole in the wall burger spot because of great reviews and I'd have to say it was totally worth it!  We had both of the fried burgers featured in Diners, drive-ins and dives and they were both ridiculously yummy...the buns were different than the norm but were hella tasty! Wish I had the appetite to devour more because the Lucky Charms malt sounded good! I'll save it for next time because there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"I always love coming here! I love the Brûlée Burger and French Toast Fries the best. I'm not near by so whenever I get the chance to stop by here I do because it's just that good. It's a quaint little place that has amazing food and great people. Definitely come here if you can!"}
{"text":"This was, quite literally, everything I expected. Did we wait a bit for our food? Yes, but it's a popular spot on a Saturday night - I'd have been suspicious if there was no wait. Also, it was worth it. The burgers were tasty, they had plenty of topping choices and they made our burgers protein-style no questions asked. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and after reading the reviews I was very excited to try it, but I wasn't very impressed. Burgers are way over priced for just getting a burger and no fries. And the fries are over priced - $2 for a little kids size fry at Mcds is what you get. The French toast fries were dry and not worth it at all. Better off making your own French toast. Also got the burger brûlée . It was pretty good but not worth $7. From looking at the pictures, it looks like they give a decent amount of less fries when you take out too. Probably wouldn't come back here because it is too expensive for their portion sizes."}
{"text":"I can't wait to come back and try different burgers. I had the brulee and was not disappointed. The sweet potato tots were a great addition. I didn't feel the burgers were too small at all, so I'm not sure what some of these reviews are talking about; they're not huge, but so decadent that they are absolutely filling. The one downside of the restaurant is that when it's crowded, it can be hard to move around and I felt a little boxed in at the table. But the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"The most amazing burgers! I was want another one after I am done with the first. They don't offer gift cards  and that sucks. Get gifts cards!!!"}
{"text":"I tried to give a half a star but it wouldn't let me. I was dying to try this place because I heard good things. So I get my food, took one bite and delicious, second bite, and I felt something that wasn't burger. I ended up pulling out a foot long hair, and I have a shaved head. I was absolutely disgusted. I took my food back in and the guy was like \"oh well that sucks, I can make you another one\" no apology, no offer to refund my money back. So they make me another burger, and the guy comes out and says \"man that sucks, this is rare, the last time this happened was like two months ago.\" Two months!!! What!! And then he proceeds to say \"well I mean you guys know hair is floating in the air, so that hair could have come from anywhere.\" Zero accountability, zero customer service. I would never recommend this place to anyone. I sincerely hope they read this and fix their business."}
{"text":"Edit: Changed from four to five stars because I must've been smoking crack the day I only gave them four stars. Their burgers and fries are delicious and reasonably priced. I would recommend trying the brulee burger. This one was definitely the winner in my book (how can it not be, it combines 2 of my favorite meals: burgers and breakfast). The people that run  the place are very passionate and nice. The only thing they could improve on is their to-go fries are a lot smaller than the portions you receive eating in the restaurant since they use these tiny paper bags. And their fries are so good that I want the same amount I get eating at the place, dammit!"}
{"text":"When I'm eating the ethnic specialties of a foreign culture, I try to just shut up and let the natives tell me how to eat it - what condiments I should use, the mechanicals of eating it, what temperatures and tastes are best. Well, Paradise Valley Burger Company's cooks are natives of Burger Country and we are just visiting, so you should shut up and let them tell you how to eat their burgers. These guys are friggin burger wizards and I am completely enthralled by their flavor magic. Always ask about the weekly special. One time I came in and the weekly special was two thin patties, battered and fried, bacon on top and bottom, collard greens with garlic, and a maple-bacon-sriracha aioli on top of waffles.  WAFFLES.  Good God.  I almost wish I had died because I'm never going to eat anything that good ever again.  The one thing I could complain about is that their seasoned fries are way too salty."}
{"text":"Best local burger joint in town. Brûlée burger is tops burger on the menu, milkshakes are killer"}
{"text":"Cool guys running the joint, have a nice convo pretty much every time I come in there, but most importantly, the Burger Brulee is seriously the GREATEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!!!! And trust me, I've eaten literally THOUSANDS OF BURGERS in my life. It really does give you a Foodgasm. The flavors explode in your mouth. The Caramelized sugar on the light, fluffy brioche bun gives a dessert quality to  it, combing with the yolk of the egg & creamy Havarti, it makes it almost like a custard, but then the bacon comes in & so its like a crazy, gourmet french toast breakfast sandwich, but then you're like \"wait I thought this was a burger?\" And then the delicious, juicy, perfectly cooked burger patty hits your taste buds & then you hear the Angle's Harps & a warm, golden light casts over you."}
{"text":"After a few years is coming here, (about a few times per year (4-7), I still love it her. So tasty, great shakes, local, delicious!"}
{"text":"Hubby wanted burgers so we found this place as they mentioned it was featured on food network. It's one of those burger places with all kinds of weird toppings. We got the most popular ones, brûlée burger and the beer batter fried burger. They were both delicious!!! Another save for AZ. It's a very casual place where u order and sit urself."}
{"text":"Bret has it dialed in! Paradise Valley Burger Co. is a gem. It's a hole-in-the-wall with ridiculously tasty burgers. Just had the burger brulee (fried egg, bacon, onion, burnt sugar, and havarti) and the beach house (roasted green chile, smoked mozzarella, and pico de gallo). Kudos to another local, independent restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Had recently been raving about Aoli Burger when I happened upon this gem. Fantastic food. Now my favorite burger joint in Phoenix. Very diverse options and the flavor explosion in your mouth is second to none. The pricing is unbelievable for the quality you receive. Will now be a regular stop of mine and the family. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"WOW. Absoluely incredible. Can't believe this place exists in Arizona. This will be world famous in no time. Sweet Potato Tater Tots with the Beach House Burger. I think i'll go back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Had the veggie tacos (grilled portobello) two ways. Very tasty."}
{"text":"This place got over hyped by my friends before they took me so I expected a lot, so let's be realistic. The food is hot and fresh, there is no doubt about that but it failed to excite me like I was promised it would. \"Watch this YouTube video of Guy Fieri enjoying this food\" I was urged, and so I did. But just like most places made more popular by tv the prices of this à la catre menu are not for your every day student eats - be prepared to shell out $20 for a burger, tots, and a shake."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good burger, this is it. At Paradise Valley Burger Company, I love that you can get gourmet burgers in a fast food setting. The prices for their specialty burgers range from $8 to $10, with an extra $2.50 for fries, but the food and quality is well worth the price.  We got the booze burger and the country fried burger. Personally, I preferred the booze burger - it was just plain deep fried goodness. Plus, they were beer battered patties, what's not to like? The country fried burger was a little smaller than I was expecting but those deep fried onions piled high on the burger, I could eat that all day long.  All in all, delicious burgers - if only it weren't a 30 minute drive out!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the bbq burger & country fried burger. Hubby said country fried had toppings that lasted all the way to the last bite. Bbq burger had sliced green chili which gave the burger a nice \"bite\" but not too much. Seasoned fries were good."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! Great, tasty, food that is delicious and priced very reasonably. Creative flavor combos along with the traditional stuff. Customer service is on point and I WILL be returning again and again. CHECK IT OUT!!! You have no idea what you're missing."}
{"text":"Good burgers, a little on the expensive side but pretty good. Little small burger place you can enjoy with the family from time to time. The fries are to die for yummmmm check them out!!! Don't miss out on great food!"}
{"text":"Wasn't what I thought it would be?  I ordered the Beach House but subbed in chicken instead of the burger. Maybe this was the problem? The chicken was not a breast, but instead it was diced and made the sandwich tremendously difficult to eat. My bun completely fell apart and I had to eat it with a fork! A fork! This just made it taste wrong. I tried my husband's paradise bacon chz and it was okay, but the burger patties were a bit greasy. The fries were really good, they had some sort of chili spice on them. The sweet potato tots were also good, but I'm not sure if they are homemade or store bought. Pretty sure they are store bought :("}
{"text":"Love it here! Everything is fresh. The employees are wonderful! The burgers are amazing, so are the tacos. For  a really good milkshake come here!! Perfect for a hot summers day. Only negative- I wish they were open on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Wow!! This was one of the best places I've been to. Just hoping they have free refills. :)"}
{"text":"Tiny tiny hole in the wall, but the brulee burger is top notch. Just don't expect to sit down if you go during dinner hours."}
{"text":"PVBC continues to impress me every time I go in. Every week they have a new burger which pushes the boundaries of sanity but they are always delicious. The owner and staff are very friendly too. Follow their Facebook page to keep up to date with the latest creations. For a first timer, I would suggest the Brulee. The sweetness of the burnt sugar balances very well the with the rich egg and mild heat of poblano."}
{"text":"First time I came here, I got the Brûlée Burger. Very delicious, hint of sweetness. Fresh burger patties.  Today, I tried the Parmesana Burger and Cardinal Fries (on the special of the day/week menu). My husband got the Fried Steak Burger.   Let me tell you.. the Cardinal Fries are to die for. It has so many flavors in it... you name it... its in there.. Cardinal Fries is basically seasoned fries loaded with roasted pork, cheddar, green chili-bacon gravy, and serrano chills. It is not too spicy at all... It has the slightest hint, if anything. If I could give Cardinal Fries more than a 5 out of 5... I would!!  The Parmesana Burger was good, but not to die for. I liked the Brûlée burger better.  The Fried Steak burger was really good though (esp. if you love fried onions). If you're wondering, its not actually a fried burger... the only thing that is fried is the onions. So delicious... my mouth is watering while typing this.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I ordered the burger with portobello mushroom!  It was really good.  They had the best sauce on their burgers, too.  I love mushrooms so the portobello burger was amazing, but they also have many other things on their menu.  I ordered a vanilla shake and it tasted pretty good, too.  The service was great and the food was great.  Very good restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went here or recommendation  of friends. It was worth of trip. Very tasty burgers, great selection of items. On a small side of portions, but flavors make up for it."}
{"text":"Good service The place was really busy and the burger showed up at my table within 15 minutes. I had this week special The anniversary burger. I would definitely come back and I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for a burger. The booze burger is so flavorful and delicious. The textures and the combinations of the flavors make this beyond gourmet. I live in Gilbert and have gone on a special trip just to get a burger and lucky charms milkshake. There is no other place like it."}
{"text":"I've been hearing people rant and rave about this place, finally made it I'm today. My roommate and I came in to grab a burger with high hopes. The guy that was at the register was helpful and had great suggestions.  I got the Beach House Burger (add bacon, because why not?)   Roommate went with \"surprise me\" they made him the Texas burger   Mine was delicious, very happy with all of it. Good flavor, size and ingredients.  Roommate liked his too (almost ordered a second one). He posted a review as well. Name is MP.   Pumpkin Oreo Milkshake. Awesome.   Great vibe to this place and wonderful food at the perfect price. Can't wait to come back and try it all."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I'm not really a burger person but I really like their burgers here at paradise valley burger company, they have so much flavor and very lean meat. The best iced tea as well, taste like sun brewed! If you haven't tried this place, you should!!!"}
{"text":"Been to this place multiple times and I love how their burgers are not ginormous!! Very friendly customer service and most importantly delicious burgers"}
{"text":"PV Burger at the SE corner of 40th St & Bell is a small, very friendly spot with a burger menu that's a little different from the norm along with tacos, grilled cheeses and salads, too. Go with an open mind and you are in for a treat.  As for me, I just got a regular cheeseburger with cheddar for my first time in.  I liked that they pressed the finished burger complete with greasy bun together so one could fit more in their mouth for a bigger bite, important if you're gonna have a burger.   Fries are kind of on the thicker side, crispy and with BBQ potato chip seasoning...again different and good.  And, hey, since I may as well do it right, I tried their shake of the day which was lemon meringue pie and if you think there's any chance that shake wasn't fantastic you must be an awful cynic.    Now that I have a feel for the place I want to try their tacos next because the sauces sound tasty."}
{"text":"Delicious. Worth the drive wherever you are. I am often disappointed by an unoriginal marriage of flavors in a burger but NOT at PV Burger! I ordered the brûlée burger which is a juicy combo of burger patties, havarti cheese, bacon, red onion, over medium egg and crispy brown sugar crust on the bun. It was incredible.  The fries were thin-ish, thicker than  fast food fries. Deliciously seasons with a salty, spicy and sweet seasoning.   I may have a weight problem after this meal...but it was worth it!!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place based on all the great reviews.  I had the cheeseburger and my husband had the bacon cheeseburger.  We were disappointed, both our burgers were soggy, wet messes.  There was far too much sauce and the sauce itself had no flavor, just sweetness.  We also did not like the sweetened fries.  The meat wasnt seasoned and it was very strange to have cucumber on a bacon cheeseburger.  We were unable to finish our meals."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. My burger was pretty small than what im used to..it was good but small.. i watched customers order burger after burger and i was wondering why they kept going back up to the register? Why didnt they just order everything at one time? As i watched more, they would eat their burger and if they wanted another one they would go back up and order just the burger. Which makes sense after seeing how big they were. I wasnt even full myself after eating the whole burger and fries. The place is located in like a strip mall area so its really small inside. The employees in there are extremely nice and pretty friendly and outgoing. Forsure they have the bragging rights of being on triple D!  I got the french toast fries which tasted pretty interesting. They are def worth a try if your coming here, the only thing is they are a little greasy.. but so good!"}
{"text":"We had the burgers at a Diamondbacks game and let's just say, it was the best food we've had there! Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing, melt in your mouth, totally delicious burgers!!!! Super excited to try a Triple D (Diners, Drive Ins and Dives) place!!!  Service was awesome, friendly and helpful!  They recommended the Beach burger which I ended up getting.  It had green chilies and pico de gallo.  Couldn't have been happier with my choice! The homemade BBQ chips with it were perfect!  Had to try the French toast fries too!!! Incredible!  So delicious!!! I highly recommend this place!!! I would definitely come again!!"}
{"text":"Food and Kailey are the best..however, the new help, didnt take my orders correctly a number of times and the food didnt outweigh the service."}
{"text":"First review. Been here over a hundred times.... and its always good, never a bad experience. Havent been to a restaurant that can really do that. Best burgers in Phoenix hands down and Im picky as ever. Thanks for doing what you do PV Burger Co."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The only problem I have is that the Burger Brûlée is soooo good, that I haven't tried anything else. Sweet potato tots are delicious  with the dipping sauces they provide. I've always gotten great service with a smile."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place, I have heard the burgers are great, but the excitement died pretty quickly. We waited in a long line to order, so I assumed it must be amazing. We ordered the beach house and BBQ burger, as well as fries and tater tots. It took about 30-40 minutes to get our food, but again, it was really busy, so we shrugged it off. When we saw our burgers coming they looked like they were going to be really good, so we were getting even more excited... Unfortunately, the patties were cold, yet overcooked and completely flavorless, the cheese was ice cold, it felt like it was just taken out of the fridge and because of that fell off the burger, and the bread fell apart. The tater tots tasted like the cheap frozen ones from the grocery store, but at least the fries were okay. I don't understand my experience given the reviews, but maybe I just came on a really REALLY bad day. I don't think I'd go back. I would recommend Zinburger or Hopdoddy over this place any day."}
{"text":"The Brulee burger at PVBC is my favorite burger hands down! I LOVE the brioche bun with burnt sugar, the havarti cheese and the pickled onions. My husband would argue the that the Cinco Diablo is their best burger tho. It has beer battered poblanos, fresno chili pesto, serrano chili pickled in tequila, avocado, jalapeno ranch and chipotle bacon. They also have a new featured burger special running all the time which is nice when you are feeling more adventurous."}
{"text":"The food and service is top shelf. It is nice to go to a great little place that hard work and great food built. They are the best when it comes to burgers."}
{"text":"In order to give this a true try, I think you realllllly have to eat there. My BF and I got it to-go and I have to say it didn't live up to its hype. The food was ready right when we got there and we only live one exit away so I don't expect the quality being entirely compromised. I even tried the French toast fries right when i got in the car and it was just meh for me--- no crisp and sorta stale. When we got home the burger was soggy kinda just a mush. Flavors were not bad though. The carnival corn was def not the stuff u get at the fair, no buttery, plump kernels here... such a bummer.    I really wanna give this another shot but i would def have to eat there."}
{"text":"\"Oh.My.God\" -says I \"what?!\" -replies friend \"What in God's name is a Brulee burger!?!\" I quickly grabbed a paper menu off of the clean counter near the cash register and flipped open to the burgers.  I know what brulee means, burnt sugar, but how could this relate to a burger.  In my wildest sugary dreams I could have never dreamt of this.  A burger, delicious and meaty, on a very nice toasty bun, with Havarti cheese, Havarti people(!), bacon, porky crispy salty bacon, a fried egg, runny and delicious, and yes, BURNT SUGAR! \"Two please... wait, no no, one, two would be silly.....(but if my friend wasn't here to witness this I would probably get 7)  and sweet potato tots please\" What saint, what angel, what GOD could create this masterpiece?  What twisted sugary mind could come up with this concoction?  If ever I meet the mad scientist who put together this beautiful monster I am liable to leave my husband and marry them.    And their shakes looked really good too, I'll get one next time."}
{"text":"Maybe I missed something because I came here due to the Yelp praises and felt cheated and disappointed. My burger was just that - a burger, nothing special or worth making the drive back there for.  Service was OK, not much enthusiasm from the wait staff when asking about options on the menu. My son also had a burger/fries and a shake and said the same thing....nothing special, not worth the reviews and overpriced.  Pass on this place if you're deciding between here and another place for burgers."}
{"text":"I don't get to eat here often but it's always good. I love the pickled onions and the buns are amazing."}
{"text":"So tasty it was ridiculous. We saw it in Triple D, drove an hour to try it and weren't disappointed. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great burgers!  Loved the Brûlée burger.  The sweet with the bacon is amazing. The fries are good too. This is a nice little hole in the wall burger joint that I will definitely be going to again."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers!! Always get the special when you go in.... Even if it sounds a little odd. You will NEVER be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've really wanted to try this place and today was my lucky day. The outside is so unassuming and a shopping center that I probably would never go to except for PVBC. Anyways, we walked in and I wasn't expecting too much on the inside but it was very cool. Little round wooden tables and very clean. Very interesting that they use clothes dryer tubes for their lighting. Very unusual. Never seen this before.   The guy at the counter was very nice and friendly. The menu was on a board but he handed us a paper menu for all the details. I decided to try their special burger of the week which as a melanzane. It had two burgers, fried egg plant, and cheese. Oh my gosh. So good. I also order the sweet potato tots. Wow. Crispy but not over cooked. We all loved them and we were fighting over them. My daughter had the Fresno chicken tacos. Comes with three. Had a bite and they were really tasty with a little kick to it. Excellent. But then my wife ordered the taco salad. It was okay. Nothing  special but she enjoyed.   I was very impressed that our food came out really fast after we ordered. They both came to our table a few time to ask us about the food and even took away our basket after we finished eating. Very cool.   I was not disappointed. This is a great place for a burger. I would say they don't  have huge portions and right in line with the cost of a great burger. I'm glad it's close to where I live so I will be back for sure. Eat up...."}
{"text":"Small little place that gets busy easily and often. I loved the creativity of there menu and burger options. The booze burger was something new and unique for me."}
{"text":"Burgers were great! The marshmallow milk shake was yummy. French toast fries were yummy. My mom got a side of gravy & said it was terrible. She said she wants to teach them how to make gravy (she's from Mississippi so she knows gravy). The  ketchup they had sitting on the table was sour & had gone bad. Very friendly service. I would 100% go back again."}
{"text":"Dont let the strip mall location dissuade you. This place is creating some tasty food. The burgers are amazing as well as the homemade bbq chips. The chocolate malt was to die for. Perfectly made. I had the PV burger with bacon and the fresno chili pesto. It really hit the spot."}
{"text":"First time coming by!  Saw the reviews on line and decided to stop by.  So good! Everything was amazing.  We got booze burger, and the Texas BBQ.  Fries and a Banana Shake.    Great job guys, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"I was unimpressed. Very surprised this place got such high reviews. It's definitely a hole in the wall. I had the beach house burger. Very greasy. The patty reminded me of a Wendy's burger. The fries were horrible they had bbq seasoning on them. Not my thing. I don't think I'll return I was looking for a nice juicy burger and this was more of a fancy fast food burger."}
{"text":"This was our first restaurant stop of our vacation and I have to say that it started with a bang!  I had the beachhouse burger and it was Amazing!!!!  My hubby had the brûlée burger and it was awesome as well. We also had a side of sweet potato tots, yummy!  Not sure if they were made fresh at the burger joint but to be honest, I really didn't care. We haven't tried the shakes yet but we're hoping to make another trip there before we go back home.  It's not a place for people who like ambiance but c'mon, you're there for a burger!!!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The burger place that you have been missing out on your whole life. PVBC is a burger lovers dream, they take the burger to a whole new level of awesomeness! A dive that you would never think would be one of the best restaurants in Phoenix. I recommend the paradise valley cheeseburger with havarti. The French toast fries are sinful but perfect for when you have a sweet tooth. I recommend going all out and getting one of their shakes. They have crazy combinations that sound wrong but taste so good!"}
{"text":"Was really excited to find a innovative burger joint very close to where I stay but was not very excited abt the price and the taste and the atmosphere. Staff was very friendly. Nice names to the burgers :) , adds value when u say it. Otherwise it's was ok for me."}
{"text":"Excellent bun to Patty ratio! Great flavor and everything homemade. My favorite burger place:)"}
{"text":"The decor is a bit spare, but the food more than makes up for it!  If I had to choose between a place decorating on a budget, versus cooking on a budget, I'd do the same thing PVB did - give it some kitschy yet modern touches but focus on the food.  First, the sweet potato tots are excellent!  Crispy outside, tender inside, and very tasty - if you like sweet potato fries definitely give these a try. (And if some maple syrup finds a way to your table - dip 'em!)  Homemade chips were great too.  The basic paradise CHZ is a very balanced burger - the brioche bun is perfectly toasted and I love the unusual options of havarti or smoked mozz in addition to cheddar.  They do the fixings a little differently too - pickled onions and cucumber are a fresh idea, and a nice change.  My only complaint was I ordered without either sauce - jalapeno ranch, or the 1000 island that I was given.  I dealt with it instead of asking them to remake the burger, but mentioned it when they circled round to find out how it was. They apologized and without asking comp'd a basket of the french toast fries!  Now, I don't know why the world has not discovered the mouthjoy created by these simple, delicious morsels before. Holy crap. Hot, dusted with powdered sugar, served with maple syrup. Holy moly, dear lord I want more of them now.  And now. {shudder} Already having withdrawal symptoms...  Fountain soda! They do have a gun now, for those of you who would like a fountain Coke and not just the canned selection or brewed iced tea.  So yes, we'll be back to try the specialty burgers, shrimp club and tacos - and the shakes.  And I'm looking forward to it.  (Hmm. French toast fries, dipped in a marshmallow malt?  Yup.  Gonna try that FOR SURE.)"}
{"text":"What can I say but......HOLY WOW!!!!! This place has GREAT burgers and Im not talk just your regular cheeseburger either. The burgera are not oversize they are just right I brought my kids and they devoured their burgers and their asking to come back to try their Tacos next.  Looks like we'll be back next week......"}
{"text":"I convinced my wife to try this place out because it had such amazing reviews and I thought it would be a cheaper option than going to Zinburger (where she wanted to go). My wife ordered the Brulee Burger which was much better than what I ordered. I got the bacon burger. It was a fine burger for a hole in the wall, but the price didn't really match the quality for me. I will admit that if I ordered the Brulee Burger my review would probably be very different."}
{"text":"Great place. Hidden gem in the valley. So catch them while they are open. Only bad comment they close early."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! A nice hole in the wall place that doesn't allow for a lot of foot traffic. So you can go in and have a  nice lunch solo or with a few people. I have been here only once but can guarantee the service this place has to offer!!  The guy behind the counter is so nice! he's very mindful! I didn't have to wait too long for my meal and I was able to soak up the atmosphere.   Try the chicken club, very delicious!!!   I definitely recommend this place to everyone!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while now and OMG I was not disappointed! The place is nothing fancy but the food speaks for itself. Everything was awesome. The burgers, the tots, the shakes, the staff. The biggest problem was trying to decide which amazing sounding burger to order. Wound up going with the Brulee Burger which was excellent. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Came here with my family on vacation. Everyone ordered different things and we all LOVED our meals. I got the taco salad and sweet potato tots which were to die for! Definitely get them as a dessert because they are very similar in taste to a donut (glazed)"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! Unique and delicious. I had the brûlée and the husband had the beach house. Can't believe I haven't heard about this place before. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I don't know whose hotter the owner or the meal.. But the meal I had was awesome I will definitely return.."}
{"text":"If you ever want a REAL burger from heaven , I'd recommend it this place . These burgers are heavy they have a certain balance of fresh and taste, all their items are unique and something rare, definitely to try. Their french fries are great ! They pound a lot on them and they taste great , wouldn't get a burger without fries . I just wish i had enough room for their lucky charms milkshake, definitely would recommend this place to any burger loving fans !"}
{"text":"Just had the best cheeseburger! This place sits in a strip mall so it's easy to miss. I've lived here forever and had never knew it existed. Really good food, really fair prices!"}
{"text":"The Burger Brulee is awesome! Fries and tots are good also. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"They are just yumm !! Loved the paradise cheese burger and the French fries with a ting of sweetness to it is to die for . It's the best burger I have had to date !!"}
{"text":"I am just going to echo what everyone else have said about this place. I love Guy and diners drive in and dives and I am in Phoenix for vacation and wanted to try something local and came across this place. I was not disappointed.   Everyone was saying to get the brûlée and even the cash register told me so I had to try it out with the sweet potato tots. It was such a good burger one of the best burgers I have had. The flavor was amazing. Definitely recommend it to people if they ask."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Really solid burger, even if you don't get a specialty burger.  Though not every burger here fits the bill, the best burgers are all about balance, and for the most part, this place has it.  1/4 lb. of meat in each burger, not too much, not too little for the square but bun which can stand up to the beef juices and other toppings.  The standard burger here has the usual toppings along with pickled onions, which adds a nice acidity.  The beef wasn't overly cooked and again, great balance between bun, meat, and toppings.  I ordered the Country Fried burger, and it was tasty.  Fried onions were the only topping, the burger was sauced with a thin, country gravy.  Could have stood to use another topping to cut the richness of the fried onions and the meat and gravy, but all in all, it's a filling and satisfying burger.  I've had the brulee burger on a previous visit and it is is good, but I don't think it's the best burger they have.  Though with the salty-sweet combo, I can see why it's a crowd favorite.  I ordered a special, the Golden Chips, which is the house chips with hot sauce, ranch, chicken, jalapenos.  Messy and tasty.  The chips, just plain, were good enough to order on their own as well.  Crispy and thick enough to stand up to all the toppings.  The fries here are also above average.  This place is a little divey-er than your typical strip mall joint, but the quality of the burger that comes out of here belies the interior.  Worth the drive to PV."}
{"text":"Burlee burger was so amazing!!! I sent my son to get us all burgers and him and I got the Burlee Burger!! It was so amazing that he will not eat burgers anywhere else anywhere. We went to cheese cake factory and he refused to eat the burger there!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  I had the bacon cheese burger with fries and I can honestly say I will be back! So delicious!"}
{"text":"Service is slow around 11:00-12:00pm . The quality of food is great even the French fries !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Triple D the other day and so I decided to try it out. So off with the family we go.  This place is in a strip mall type setting. The location was a little small and dirty. The staff was friendly and helpful with the menu.  So let's get to the food. My kids ordered off the kiddie menu and they really enjoyed their burgers and fries. My wife ordered the Cinco Diablo and it was okay, taste wise. The Serrano chili's were disappointing and left a lot to be desired. Now comes my order, which was the Booze Burger. Let's start with what I enjoyed about it. The 2 beer battered patties, green chili's and the bun. The vodka cream sauce was a big disappointment as it was bland and tasteless. Not really sure what they were going for here. But, it was better then the Cinco Diablo burger. We also ordered a side of seasoned fries. Now, I've never had sugar and cinnamon on my fries but they were also a major disappointment to say the least.  Cinco Diablo 2 out of 5 Booze Burger 3 out of 5 Seasoned Fries 1 out of 5 Kids Burgers 4 out of 5 Flat Coke 1 out of 5 Service 4 out of 5  Overall, this place is about 3 out 5 stars. It was just okay/average and I've definitely had better. If I ever get a chance to meet Guy Fieri, I'm gonna punch him square in the nose. This is the second time he's over hyped a place and it failed to deliver."}
{"text":"Quite honestly, I was underwhelmed by the looks of this place. You order at the counter and your meal is brought to you. Friend had a burger, partner had the grilled cheese, and I had the pulled vegetarian. I was thoroughly impressed with how tasty the pulled veg was. It was drenched in BBQ, but I suppose an acceptable amount as I could not stop eating the damn thing. It was very messy, BTW. I would return for that sandwich alone! I was also hoping to order a milkshake but was much too full after my sandwich and fries.   Service was friendly and fast- prices very reasonable esp for the portions! I will definitely be back here!  *vegetarian note - love that they had the pulled vegetarian. The dish itself is essentially cabbage smothered with BBQ. Delicious. They also have the  option of portobello for an additional $2 on any burger they have. I personally think that it's silly to charge $2 extra for a mushroom...but whatever, I appreciate the option."}
{"text":"Saw the Triple D episode and decided to stop in and try the country fried burger. It was ok, nothing fabulous, the gravy was actually quite bland which surprised me, watching it be made on the episode. Husband tried the Diablo and it wasn't spicy; tried a bite myself and didn't like it at all. Cardinal fries were good, sauce once again kinda lacking flavor. I don't live close so I don't see myself going out of my way to return. I'll remain a Lenny's Burger gal. Also, the burgers are kinda small, so I thought it was a bit expensive for what you get, sides are not included."}
{"text":"Great care and consideration is taken in their burgers. How many use a torch to burn cane sugar on your Brioche bun to create a Brûlée burger?  This place spends their money on ingredients not so much on fancy decorations or cleanliness. Just what I'm looking for."}
{"text":"I'm gonna start by saying: I don't have one thing negative to say.      Love the comfortable & casual feel of it.  The menu has a variety of regular burgers and specialty burgers.  Tacos and some other tasty sounding items.   I love the homemade bbq chips."}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had!  We have lots of burgers in Portland, but nothing even compares to the Brulee burger I had at your place. Luckily for me I dropped my daughter off for college there so I will be back.  I also ordered the sweet potato tots that were really good. Tender and slightly sweet!  You had a special that looked amazing and most of all creative. That's what sets you apart. Very creative!!"}
{"text":"I'm a self-described foodie on a budget. This place seriously has the most epic hamburgers I have ever had in my life. The level of creativity that goes into the burgers of the week is awesome. My husband and I just moved from the Bay Area where we had all kinds of diverse food at our fingertips.  We would travel up and down the peninsula and up to Napa to find the best happy hours, restaurants, dives, and epic foodness. Well, I can tell you one thing.  If this place were in the Bay Area you'd probably have to wait hours to get in the door for what they are serving up! The first burger we tried was a menu staple - the brulee. And the second burger was a burger of the week - the bananas foster.  You may be thinking that bananas on a burger would be just weird, but it was a bite into gourmet burger heaven! From then on went 1-2 times a week for about a month and a half straight.  The burger of the week keeps us coming back over and over again.    And prices? Seriously, 7 bucks for a burger that is this epic?  I would gladly and willingly pay more.  And no joke, if this place was in the Bay Area, you could easily double the price and people wouldn't blink an eye.   I read in another review, that someone wanted \"ambiance.\" Well, this is the best gosh dang burger you'll have in your life.  If they wanted burger \"ambiance\" then they could visit burger king.  It's literally steps away in the parking lot.  Such a shame too... Every time I leave Paradise burger, I wonder how so many people in the drive through at \"have it your way - but really our way\" can feel satisfied at that meal. I also wonder if they know that they are passing up such a gem!  One last thing.  They have a magicness of a dessert called \"french toast fries.\" They are basically all the best crunchy bits you get from the corners and edges of french toast served up with a warm side of syrup. These should never ever be removed from the menu!  Okay, I really could go on and on.  If you want a food experience go here!  If you are another sheep following the crowd and want to sacrifice taste for \"ambiance\" then you don't belong here anyway... go \"have it your way\" somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, burgers were some of the best.  A true hole in the wall, but their food knocks it out of the park.  Saw them on TV and figured we would try, I was not disappointed.  Nothing fancy, just a good old burger.  Great find, a gem for sure"}
{"text":"Glad that I was able to find this little neat place. The burgers are well priced but the sides are a little on the pricey side. I ended up trying their normal burger and it came with 2 meat patties and the bun was toasted well. They have a variety of burgers and I'll definitely be back to try more.   The aesthetics could use a little work. I appreciate that the utensils and to go boxes were extremely accessible, but if you're expecting a super fancy burger place, then you'd be disappointed. It's a little dinky but go for the food and not for the aesthetics."}
{"text":"The place is certainly a hole in the wall joint! I ordered the paradise burger with bacon and everything else. It was a good burger that wasn't greasy or falling apart by the time I got it home. The veggies on it make it taste a little lighter, so your not feeling like a slug after you eat it. The fries that I ordered were pretty bad. It was like they dropped the whole bottle of season salt on them. I'm sure the fries would be really good with light salt on them. Overall, its a good burger joint, that didn't live up to the hype from my family. I'm sure ill try it again later on, and give it a second look."}
{"text":"Great burger! Fries and tators were great! Peanut butter malt was excellent! Nice to get a fancy burger without having dress up!"}
{"text":"After reading several reviews on Yelp we decided to stop by on our mini vacation. INCREDIBLE!   Brulee Burger was a hit along with the Country Fried.....and the sweet potato tots...to die for. Great burgers!"}
{"text":"We were in the area for a staycation and used Yelp to find this treasure.  The service is quick and the food is hot! I had the veggie sandwich and it was wonderful.  My husband loved his chicken sandwich.  I would definitely go out of my way for the veggie."}
{"text":"PV Burger is the best burger in town.  They are true burger innovators.  I have tried all the burgers on the menu.  My favorite is the Country style burger.  I like to add an egg to mine.  Soooo good.  I get their home made chips with every burger I order.  The seasoning is something special.    The true greatness of PV Burger is not on the regular menu.  It is the weekly special.  Like some kind of creative master mind or maybe evil genius.  The chief (yes I said chef, this is no regular cook in the kitchen)  makes a completely unique burger every week.  You never know what he will come up with next.  This is no bacon and BBQ burger.  This is beer battered hamburger patties or roasted duck maybe  fried mozzarella.  They are just incredible.  But that is not all.  They have taco's and sandwiches.  I really like the sloppy Joe's.  They are a bit spicy and perfect for waking up your taste buds.  They also have a monthly milkshake.  Oh and don't forget to get the French Toast Fries."}
{"text":"Unpopular opinion -- I don't think I understand all the fuss ?  I've been here several times, as my husband likes it quite a bit. There are a lot of odd varieties of burgers here that might be great, but I'll never try (e.g. clam chowder burger, brûlée sugar, sloppy joe burger) and the ones I have tried like the Paradise and the Diablo, were fine.  I like a thicker patty that lets me specify a temperature. If I can't have a medium rare/ medium temperature, it won't be a great burger. Here, the patties are thin. And I don't really like burgers covered in unexpected things...guess I am a traditionalist.   I knew the place was going to be a dive before going, but it really is. You just order at the counter, they bring your food and you go.    I'd rather go somewhere else, but overall, it's fine."}
{"text":"Not bad... gourmet burgers.  The \"seasoned fries\" taste like bbq potato chips... crazy"}
{"text":"Loved the brûlée burger!! It was a little messy with the fried egg, but the combination of the egg, sugar, meat, etc was so good!  I also had the sweet potato tots, which are always tasty.   My friends tried various other items on the menu and everyone enjoyed them.   However, some of my friends did not like the water and thought it tasted horrible, but it was because they didn't know it was cucumber water.. Haha"}
{"text":"Don't judge this place from the outside. We almost didn't stop. OMG the food is outstanding and different with a twist.  The bun had caramelized sugar on it Yummm. Grilled corn very good. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place was really nice.  The employees were very kind and helpful which just gives me a good feeling in general. The cashier gave me suggestions and had a good knowledge of the menu.  The burgers were very good.  The fries i believe are frozen."}
{"text":"FAKE REVIEWS!!!!  Are you kidding me? This is another DDD restaurant that doesn't deserve all the hype!  This place is dirty and the food is only mediocre. If this place wasn't on TV, they wouldn't get all these reviews.   I doubt they'll have many repeat customers, I know I won't be going back and I live close by."}
{"text":"Not a fan. And, honestly, probably 50% of the Guy Fieri picks haven't really thrilled us. If the idea of a burger loaded with different/non-traditional toppings is your perfect pick, then this place is for you. On the other hand, if you look for the best quality meat with real beefy bite, you won't find it here. This was our experience anyway. Burger = beef and I can't say a smooshed down patty satisfies."}
{"text":"I had the Brule Burger which is very tall with the meat patties bacon onions egg and bun so you really can't bite it head on. the bun has sugar burned into it so it has the creme brulee taste and sweetness. The seasoned fries are above average, if they were a little softer I think I would like them more."}
{"text":"Pretty no frills interior when you walk in, but a very helpful and friendly staff greets you. I'm also pretty sure The Fresh Prince of Bel Air was playing when I walked in. After ordering, it only took a few minutes to get everything out. The fries were dusted with this delicious seasoning and tasted absolutely fresh. I ordered the brioche burger I believe, and it was incredible. Everything tasted fresh and hand made. The bun had a coating of brown sugar which gave it a little sweetness, but not overpowering.  The cheese, meat, egg and ingredients were paired extremely well, and unlike major chains and other burger places, it didn't feel overly greasy or sloppy- perfect. There's so many unique burgers on the menu, so when I'm in the area I'll definitely be back.  My first experience overall was excellent, probably one of the best burgers I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Let's give this burger place a try! It's a hole in the wall place next to a liquor store haha. They don't come wait on you at the tables you have to line up and place your order in. They do however will call out your name when they bring the burgers out and deliver the burger to you. I ordered the paradise burger and sweet potato tater tots. Which I wasn't a fan of the toasted brioche bun otherwise the burger was good I like how they put cucumbers in it. The taters were really good. I had some of my sisters waffle fries in maple syrup and yeah that was not my favorite. It was just too sweet."}
{"text":"Fanatstic burgers, super friendly staff, and very reasonably priced.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time and it was delicious. Sweet Potato Tater Tots were outstanding and burger was perfect. Nice owners and great service. If you haven't been then go."}
{"text":"WOW!!!!!! Burger was to Wonderful damm was not expecting the great taste and the tots OMG!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the very best burgers you will find anywhere. Very casual. Very inexpensive. I wish they did a better job keeping the floor clean but I love this place anyway."}
{"text":"The sweet potato tots were amazing! The burgers were great too, especially with the jalapeño ranch! The only downside was it was cramped inside, but I definitely will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Thin patties. Quality ingredients. Great buns and bacon. Fries are good. Shakes are good. I have heard good things about their tacos but I have not tried them. Give it a try"}
{"text":"Went with expectations of a good burger after seeing DDD show. Ordered the booze burger and fries. Got a very dry burger, that was cold, didn't see any \"Fresno peppers pickled in whiskey \" and the sauce came on the side but had no flavor! And I guess I ordered the kid size fries cause the bag was only half full and they were cold too. All around disappointing experience. Don't bother trying this place had a better burger at McDonald's"}
{"text":"I came upon PVBC while looking for a \"hot & new\" lunch business close to work as on Fridays I like to #treatyoself for cheat day meals. And this place does not disappoint with all of those calories available to purchase! Even more impressive is that you're not breaking the bank to eat here. $12 for a tasty burger and a massive shake.   It's nothing too fancy, but I wouldn't call PVBC a dive or diner per se. Just very casual. Order at the counter from their simple menu and they'll bring it out to you if not terribly busy. I got the Paradise CHZ and the Marshmallow Shake. Both ahhh-mazing. Whatever their house sauces are on the burger, get a side of it for burger-dipping. It's messy, but worth it! Definitely one of the best burgers I've ever eaten in my life. No. Questions. Asked. And the shake... brings back memories of picking out the Lucky Charms from the cereal box [and getting yelled at by my mom] + delicious ice cream.   Next time? The Booze Burger, extra house sauce, another shake, and FRIES."}
{"text":"What's all the excitement about??  This strip mall dive offers some interesting choices. But the delivery was mediocre at best. We ordered  the Texas BBQ which sounded great!  Ok, here goes my opinion.....  The Patty -  was only a couple steps above an In & Out burger, taste-wise (kinda flavorless for being a BBQ marinated patty! I know I'm going on about the beef but hey, that is a vital component.... right!  One last thing if you're not a fan of sugar sprinkled fries ..... or whatever sweet stuff they use.  Let them know and they serve sans seasoning! I'm not a cheap skate but if I'm paying 8 plus bucks for a burger I set the bar/standard higher than an In & Out!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and great service.  Really small restaurant where you order at the front and they bring it out. Decent selection of canned sodas and bottled water in the cooler next to the register. Food came out quickly and was hot. The only thing to be aware of is they have no healthy options. The burgers themselves probably have more cheese, grease etc. compared to most others."}
{"text":"I had never been here before today. Had the special w/o the beer battered rye bread (since I am GF) - the burger was topped with havarti and pastrami brulee and a Brussel sprout slaw. It was topped with a jalapeño aioli. Really good. Had the seasoned fries which were just okay. My friend had the Country Burger and he enjoyed it. He had the sweet potato tots and I wasn't sure if they were breaded but I did try one and loved it. Overall I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Overall this is a very good restaurant.  The staff are very nice, the prices are good, the service is fast, and the food is very tasty.  Paradise doesn't deliver in spades however.  It lacks in location and the environment could use work.  Things like uncomfortable chairs and only having Sweet N Low keep this from being a five star review.  Paradise has the potential to go big, it is definitely a restaurant worthy of expansion."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers.  Great sides  Great shakes (I recommend the pb shake with a classic PV burger and sweet potato tatter tots) This place is a dive!!!  As it was featured on diners drive ins and dives, its just that a dive. Not any place I would have ever gone to unless I knew it was amazing.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Very unassuming little place. Everyone I've ever dealt with there is friendly. Awesome burgers! Love the brulee burger and the sweet potato tots! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had the Buger Brulee.  Burger - delicious.  Fries good.  Very friendly and welcoming service.  I will be back to try more.  Safe for your vegetarian friends who can substitute beef patties with Portabella mushrooms."}
{"text":"I say this is a 4.5 star. It was a little higher priced than I imagined. But, the food was satisfying and had some original unique recipes for burgers.   I ordered the weekly special. It was standard two 1/8 oz beef patties perfectly charred medium with beefy juice still in each bite. Topped with two salamis, carmelized chopped onions, olive tapenade, and a sweet garlic aioli, served on a fresh soft ciabatta bun! The flavors danced gracefully all over my tongue! Well done!  The lady at the front was so sweet and had some south west hospitality. \"I got choo, I got choo.\" Was her saying. I love when people make a point to steer you in the best direction for a tasty bite!  Next time I will try the famous DDD brûlée burger. Or the country!"}
{"text":"Their burgers are amazing. Way better than any fast food joint. Ordered a bacon cheeseburger and peanut butter shake. Everything was 5 stars"}
{"text":"I've been here a dozen times.. and EVERY time I'm so impressed with the quality, creativity and service! Peeps are so chill, and the food is so good! And a new burger to try every week!  (I've gotta say that my favorite one so far is the St. Patty's Day burger!)"}
{"text":"I only wish I had more!!  Wow. These burgers definitely stand out from the rest!!!  I got the burger brulee-- & devoured it!! The bun was brioched & tasted amazing. I love the fact that they used pickled onions too. Burgers are cooked to order & cooked perfectly at that. Also got a side of fries which tasted crispy & fresh.  Service was cool. They were prompt & friendly.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Unique and now very busy. I started eating here when they first opened. The salads are very good and the fun burgers and sloppy Joe are phenomenal. I like restaurants that are different and this one is in a very good way.  Update- they know longer have the sloppy joes(sad)"}
{"text":"So freaking good. Honestly it's really good. Get something you don't think you will like. You will still love it."}
{"text":"After some time driving by this joint and giggling because you can only see \"BURGER\" in huge letters from their sign... WE DID IT. And there's no going back.   Everything about this place is what you know about burgers but flipped upside down. Pickles? No... thin cucumber slices. Onions? No... PICKLED onions. The combinations that these guys come up with is spectacular - ummm... maple bacon pecan milkshake anyone? YES. Hit that. Hit it hard. You won't regret it.  French toast fries, lucky charm milkshakes, sweet potato tater tots, brûlée burger (burnt sugar on a brioche bun, you guys!)... this place is far from ordinary and a creative adventure for your taste buds to go on.  Each week they offer up a new burger and shake that are not on the regular menu and every time they have been incredible.  Our bills have been a little on the pricey side but what you're paying for is something special indeed."}
{"text":"Very good burgers !!  Back again - we love their burgers!  I had the Brûlée Burger - excellent again! My son had the Ultimate Pretzel Burger - my son gave it a 9.8 out of 10!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and was looking for a place to grab a burger before we had to make it to a concert. Spotted the Rating on Yelp and thought it must be worth a try.......   Perfect for a Dives and Dinners!! Great burgers and some interesting combinations!  Both my and the Mrs burgers had pickled onions and she was looking up how to make them as soon as we left!!  I had the Burlee burger and WOW!!!!  Fried egg, burnt Sugar, Havarti Cheese and of course the pickled Onions!!!  I topped it off with a Sweet Potato tater tots milk shake. They have Fruit Loops and Lucky Charms shakes too!!!!  If in the area, make it a point to stop in!!!"}
{"text":"First time here, had the Paradise Chz Burger w/sweet potato tots and everything was delish! The bun was crispy, I didn't want the pickled onions or cucumbers but the guy taking my order recommended them, and I am so glad I had them on my burger! The tatter tots were fresh, hot with just the right crisp! For a little hole in the wall this place is definitely worth the stop!!"}
{"text":"My coworkers took me to Paradise Valley Burger Company claiming \"You have to try this burger place!\" and so I came here excited with high expectations.  PVB is a hole in the wall, with unassuming decor but as soon as you're within twenty feet of the venue the alluring smells of freshly made burgers waft through your nostrils. Everyone can think of at least one place like this in their life. That magnificent hole in the wall whose greatness lies not in the ambience, but in the food. This was one of those places. After studying the menu, I decided to go with the signature Brulee Burger. The burger is chock full of bacon, pink pickled onion, havarti, burnt sugar, and topped with a fried egg.  As soon as I took a bite of the Brulee Burger a symphony of burger angels came down and sang to me. The yolk exploded into a waterfall of yellow goodness, with perfectly cooked beef. The mix of sweetness meets salty did not disappoint. Every other bite was a fulfilling taste of 'burnt sweetness' that was not overpowering but the type of balance that takes creative flair and preciseness to execute.  I'm not done yet. The sides were impressive as well. Since I was with my coworkers, we did family style and I got to sample the Sweet Potato Tater Tots - I could snack on these for days. In addition, we ate the special, Jalepeno Fries. These were beer battered jalepeno coupled with brown sugar, truffle ketchup. I've never seen anything like these before, but why? They tasted amazing! Every burger joint should have these on their menu. All in all, the food blew my mind and I have to give them 5 stars for their amazing flavors."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. PV Burg (as my boyfriend and I so affectionately call it), is really the best burger in town. My standard order is the Brulee and I haven't been disappointed once. I love the crazy combinations these guys come up with and that we can support a local joint instead of the same chain burger places time and again. Guys behind the counter are always friendly and fun to joke with, they play the best tunes, and the sweet potato tots are top notch. I'd be lost without them."}
{"text":"Ok,  3 visits and here is my opinion: it's just ok.   I like the weekly burger idea. Order at the counter,  no ambiance, next to drive thru liquor  (that may appeal to some) prices high for a burger that leaves you hungry.  Same guy has always taken my order, likely the owner/partner - decent fella.  I've had one of thier signature burgers (beach house) that put them on the map and man it was just ok.  Fries ok. Shakes decent.  I most liked the country fried burger.   They do put a bit of a \"presentation\" effort into thier burgers.  For the same $ give or take a couple bucks - my goodness there are definately  better burgers that will also include the full package experience of a meal, flavor as well fill you up.  I'm beside myself with some of the stellar reviews and it was those that kept me coming back to see what I was missing.  I wasn't missing anything, sorry PVBC and its fans.  I just had a double burger and I'm starving!"}
{"text":"I make sure to go at least once a month the PVBC. Hands down not just the best burger but also the best fries and shake ever. These dudes really know how to cook some food and run a business"}
{"text":"Never disappointed when we go here. My husband and i always order the special, without asking what it is, because its always a delicious surprise. The most unique, and best, burgers around."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is always great. Wonderful burgers, tater tots, slaw, French toast sticks, and pulled pork.  I love the brioche buns.  Really affordable/cheap."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my client, Academy of Scuba and had an outstanding burger. The marinara burger was incredible and the tots were amazing. They gotta franchise this place. Yum!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 or 6 times and have enjoyed every visit. The Burger Brulee is still my favorite next to the portabella mushroom burger they sometimes offer (Where the mushrooms substitute for the buns.)Messy but fun. The marshmallow shake is one of the best shakes I've had anywhere, let alone AZ.  I've really glad this place has been building a name for itself and I'm a fan. I hope to visit again soon.  My only wish is that the owner would update their website or Facebook page more often to reflect the weekly specials."}
{"text":"We came here because it was featured on diners drive-ins and dives with Guy Fieri from the food network channel.  We got burgers and fries.   I have to say I'm not sure what the fuss is all about.  The burger was boring.   Not good flavor meat.  The bread was interestingly good.   Buttered, fresh and fluffy which made for a better hamburger.   The sauce on the burger was interesting.   Hints of unexpected orange zest flavor that left my mouth wondering about what in eating..  The fries were cooked well with simple hamburger seasoning on them.   Nice all around but not a destination."}
{"text":"What to add when Yelpers have already faithfully posted 500 reviews? I scanned through the mass of comments about Paradise Valley Burger Company and I have a half dozen observations to share.   First, the counter staff is amazingly helpful and friendly, ready to explain their offerings at the slightest hint of uncertainty. You should have no fear about coming here for the first time.   Second, the burgers are just the right size. Two beef patties, but not a massive weight gainer. Not a walk away hungry burger either. Just right.   Third, all those reviewers who rave about the Brulee burger, the burgers of the week, the French toast fries, the sweet potato tots... Everything they say is true.   Fourth, the pricing is not what you'd call cheap, but it's very reasonable, with a basic PV Burger coming in at $5.25 and more elaborate choices listed at $7 or $8. No sides are included, but I'd rather order just what I want and share anyway.   Fifth, it is a small neighborhood restaurant that just happens to be  a foodie paradise. You would never find it without Yelp's help. The dining room is small, although not quite as tiny as the storefront would indicate. Simple, clean and comfy. Perfect.  Sixth, kids are welcome. Space is sometimes in short supply, but there is still plenty of room for the kids. A $5 kids menu features, among other things, small versions of basic burgers (one patty instead of two) complete with a side of fries. Oddly, the menu says these meals are only for kids age seven and under?!? I assume they don't enforce that age limit.  My suggestion would be that you drop your anti-DDD bias and reward yourself by giving the Paradise Valley Burger Company a try."}
{"text":"Great selection of unusual burgers.  Amazing combinations and creativity.  Highly recommend.  One the best burgers I have in town."}
{"text":"My fiancé and father in law LOVE burgers. No matter what I suggest, they want a burger. Before coming here, I wasn't super excited to eat a burger but PV Burger company consistently has me wanting to come back. The brûlée burger is still my number one favorite. It's the perfect balance of semi sweetness and the richness of egg yolk and a perfectly cooked burger. The booze burger is a close second, that chili vodka bacon cream sauce is out of this world!"}
{"text":"This place definitely has potential, but there aren't enough pros at the moment (and way too many cons) to get me to return.  Pros: Brulee Buns... OMG... these are amazingly good!!! Definitely worth the extra $1 to get it! Burnt sugar on the insides of the bun... genius!!!  Beef... I honestly couldn't tell if the charcoal flavor was from the beef or the Brulee Bun, but either way, the \"burger\" tasted good.  Service... the guys that work here seem passionate about the restaurant and were all very patient (I'd never been here before) and friendly.  Cons: Price vs. Quantity and Quality... First of all, the burgers are not very big for the price. Also, the portion of fries was quite expensive for such a small serving (but that was ok because I didn't want to finish them). I talk about quality below.  Fries... I ordered seasoned fries and was expecting seasoned breading. What I got were extremely mediocre plain fries sprinkled with a little BBQ seasoning. I didn't like them (it was hard to finish my small serving), and the mayo or ketchup I had at the table didn't help. Which brings me to...  Ketchup... seriously, whatever generic brand of ketchup this is, it's really gross. Thin, watery, with a very off flavor. Even store brand would be 100% better. It reminded me of eating fries in Elementary School.  Lettuce (iceberg) and tomato... the produce quality wasn't great. It wasn't the worst I've ever had, but it was definitely lacking. Again, I expected better for the price of this small burger.  Neutral: French Toast Fries... these were ok. The portion size was actually on point with the price, but there was just something a little off about them. Old oil? I'm really not sure. Maybe we were just a little put off by the \"cons\" that it was just our imagination.  All in all, I really wanted to like this place, but didn't. I'm not sure if things were exactly like this when Guy Fieri visited, but if they were, then I'm not sure why he is considered a food expert. To the owners of this restaurant... you can do better and I think you know it. While we were there, you guys seemed pretty busy. Maybe you have some regulars that come in all the time and you're comfortable with the way things are, but you can't ride the hype from DDD forever if there's mediocrity going on. I might check Yelp in 6 months to a year, see if you've changed. If not, there are plenty of other truly gourmet burger shops around."}
{"text":"Even though I've been eating burgers like it's my job lately, I stopped in Paradise Valley Burger Co. for lunch after a recommendation from a client. I was in their neck of the woods, so I took their word.   Well, forget the diet! I'd eat a burger every day if I'd known about this place!  A delicious, buttery burger bun, a juicy, seasoned burger with Havarti cheese and lots of ketchup! MMMMMmmmmm. It was so amazing. I also had a side of sweet potato tots, which quickly disappeared into my belly! I've heard ALL of their burgers are amazing, so I'll have to pay them another visit very soon! Also if you are nearby, check out the local scuba shop, Academy of Scuba!"}
{"text":"There is nothing on the menu that I would not order. Had the special, chorizo burger special! Great balance of flavors! Homemade chips! Sweet potato tots!!"}
{"text":"Just good burgers. The special is always a treat to try. They have some amazing burger option on the menu as well. Seems to be an all around, local operated, good burger joint.  Never been disappointed with a burger yet. The guys always seem friendly and ready to serve."}
{"text":"Average of 4.5 stars?  Eh.....I unfortunately disagree.  This is like barely 2 stars.  In honor of National Cheeseburger Day, I decided to go and get one.  I had this place bookmarked and it was close enough to work that I decided to have my cheeseburger here.  I should have gone somewhere else :-(.  It wasn't horrible,  but it was far from great.  I rolled in the joint and placed my order for a Paradise Valley Cheeseburger with an extra patty, sweet potato tots and a Diet Coke.   After I placed my order, the cashier dude started talking baseball with me (I wear my St. Louis Cardinal hat all the time) and started asking how the Cardinals were doing etc.  That was cool and the best part about the visit.   I paid the man my money, $11.60 something and then took a seat.  I noticed that the place was a little bit dirty.  The trash was overflowing, flies were on the windows and a lot of tables were dirty.  I hoped for the best............. A few minutes later, my food came out.  Here is how it was....................  Double Cheeseburger-  Um....it was just alright.  It was presented nicely with a toasted bun and some fancy toppings, but it lacked \"goodness\".  This thing came with 2 small burgers, cheddar cheese, thousand island and then it was topped with veggies.  Not sure if they are trying to be fancy, but the veggies didn't really work.  They had a tomato, pickled onions which were tasteless and 3 cucumbers....not pickles...didnt taste any vinegar.  I tasted cucumber.  The burgers didn't have much flavor, the cheese was ok, the thousand island was runny.  The bun was alright.  I was not impressed.  I ate the whole thing but did not really enjoy it at all.  Sweet Potato Tots-  Meh...frozen, not really crispy, no flavor, semi small portion.  I used the ketchup on the table and it was runny too (just like the thousand island).  I only ate a few of them and tossed 75%.  Meh.  Diet Coke-  Even this tasted a little off.  Not enough carbonation or something.   Overall I was sadly not impressed at all!  $12.00 for my meal, the burger was kind of small and tasteless and the tots were just plain boring.  The only good thing about the meal was my chat about baseball.  That is kind of sad.  I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We had a bacon burger, plain burger, cheeseburger and a Beach House burger, french fries and sweet potato tater tots.  Three of the burgers were good, with the fourth a bit overcooked and the bun burned.  French fries were just OK and the tator tots were a bit mushy.  Unique menu with several vegetarian options including taco salads.  Service was good and very friendly.  Go!"}
{"text":"This was the best burger joint I have ever had they have the best Lucky Charm Milkshake I have ever drank. The burger is very delicious and has so much that you can taste that will make your mouth water. You should go with friends to this burger place so you have so many good burgers. And they have the best seasoned fries and Chipotle ketchup and Jalapeño Ranch. You should go here and won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Holy frick this place friggin kills!! Best food in town when you get a case of the munchies. The brûlée burger is out of this friggin world, and the fries are sweet and seductive. One time I went and the special burger was like... pulled pork on a hamburger patty? Whatever it was... friggin bomb"}
{"text":"Great  food. Small space inside with about 10 tables. Basic burger menu. They do everything well. The homemade potato chips, fries and sweet potato fries were great too not just the burgers. I hope they stick around!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside scare you away!  Saw all the yelp reviews and thought lets give it a try.  We were on the 101 and went 2 miles out of the way.  It was worth it!  Burgers were excellent, ranch dressing was amazing and every staff member that helped us was super friendly."}
{"text":"\"MMmmm, this is a tasty burger\"  Jules Winnfield   PVBC is doing everything right!  If you're craving a delicious, unique burger experience, you need to to give this place a go!!  So many different burgers, I wish I lived closer so I could go more often!  What sets PVBC apart from anyone else is the variety of very tasty burger combinations.  The chef definitely knows what's up, so many amazing flavor combos.  Hate to be cliche and say this but my favorites are the Brûlée Burger and the Country Fried Burger which were featured on Diners Drive ins and Dives.  The fries are very crispy and seasoned perfect.  The Green Chili/Vodka Cream Sauce is so yummy!! They have a burger you can order it on or you can get it on the french fries, do it and thank me later!!  After you've enjoyed the best burger in town, be sure you save room for a little dessert.  The French Toast Fries are amazing and is always a table favorite. Be sure and order some for your group and thank me later again lol!   Best Burger Joint in Town. Period."}
{"text":"I have been to this place four times now. I am absolutely IN LOVE with their quality, atmosphere, and ingredients.   I get the Beach House every time. The consistency of this place is amazing! ALWAYS perfect burgers, delicious chile on top, and amazing jalapeno ranch to go with it. Even the fries are incredible! I would recommend this place to ANYONE, ANYTIME."}
{"text":"Gosh i love this place.  I don't even eat burgers but i will go for the grilled cheese and awesome sweet potatoe tots!! Mmm nom nom nom"}
{"text":"Just a wonderful place for a great burger interesting combinations wonderful shakes sorry no alcohol"}
{"text":"Based on Yelp review my girlfriend and I decided to try this place even though it was little far.  I went to the restaurant and ordered letting them know that on cheeseburger absolutely no sauces as my girlfriend is allergic to it.  I ordered protein stle burger along with 2 orders of sweet potato tots.   Sweet potato tots were not crisp and there is sauces on my girlfriends cheeseburger.   When I called about the sauce they said they will make a new one and I could come and pick it up.  My friend is recuperating from a surgery and she didn't want me to leave again.   It was not worth the drive."}
{"text":"OK, so on Saturday I the brulee burger at Paradise Valley Burger Co. Very disappointed. The bun was already soggy on arrival and it quickly fell apart, so I could not pick it up to take a bite. I had to use a knife and fork, which diminished the sensory experience of biting into the burger. The meat itself was in pieces, not a whole patty. It was like I got the leftovers or something after the lunch rush (I went around 2 p.m.) The havarti cheese was sloppily placed on the burger pieces and was falling off the back of the bun. The sweet potato tots were greasy and sort of burned. The flavor of the burger was decent, but there were too many problems, especially aesthetically. And for the money, totally not worth it. I went way out of my way to go here (I live in Downtown Phoenix). Will not come back. I am sure the owner won't care, as the place was crowded when I left. Bleh."}
{"text":"Ok, that was delicious :) If this was any closer I'd be in serious trouble.   Out with Jennifer O. (who hit the 1000 review mark today!) a group of us visited Paradise Valley Burger Co. The burgers are creative, delicious and ridiculously affordable. The Burger Brulee is served with a perfectly cooked over easy egg, bacon (who doesn't love bacon?), onion, burnt sugar and havarti cheese. The sides and shakes are great comfort food.   It may sound strange, but, french toast fries are divine. It's actually what you're (perhaps secretly) hoping will be served. Fried egg bread with a side of maple syrup. (I had one! JUST one fry.) The grilled corn on the cob is lightly buttered and a surprising addition to enjoy with a burger.  And in other strange (yet satisfying) fare are the shakes. Bacon and maple syrup? Yup. Hot damn that's good. (Made with legit chunks of bacon.)  The setup is simple. You order at the register, pay and food is delivered to your table. The space is medium sized, sprinkled largely with 2-top round tables, which can easily be pulled together. A casual place to eat.  Alas, no booze. They do have fun stuff like YelloMello and Fanta tho! The menu is kid friendly with options for the little ones.  Don't drive too fast or you might pass it by. (If I hadn't been looking for the place I wouldn't have noticed it. It's to the left of a liquor store. A *drive thru* liquor store.) Pricing in PV Burger is slightly higher than their online menu. (My Brulee burger was $8, it is listed as $7 online.)  Definitely a place worth checking out!"}
{"text":"PVBC really surprised me!  The menu is easy, I like easy.  The burger came out fast, way faster than I expected.  I got the bacon cheddar and it was really delicious.  They add a slice of cucumber and pickled onions, it was such a great treat.  The bread was glazed with butter.  COME ON... THAT BURGER WAS LEGIT.  SO GOOD.  I ordered the tater tots, they only have sweet potato ones and I wasn't feeling the, but my friend ordered fries and she shared.  Nice portion size and the price point is spot on.   Drinks are cans or bottles, I prefer a soda machine or fresh iced tea (I think they had fresh iced tea, I must have missed it).  My only gripe is that there isn't a can recycle bin. If that's my only gripe, I call it a good deal. I can bring my can home with me if it bothers me.    I'm going back, that is FOR SURE."}
{"text":"We saw Paradise Valley Burger Co. on an episode of Diners Drive-inns and Dives, and had to try it! The burgers were amazing, I had the beach house burger and fries and my fiancé had the country fried burger and tots, both delicious!"}
{"text":"We heard of this burger joint from our good friends, Kat & Elio.    Holy Crap!  Freaking delicious burgers and awesome sides, amazing shakes and malts.  I had a pulled pork sandwich on a brioche bun.  Soooo good - messy - really messy - but roll around in it good.  I loved the carnival corn, the French toast fries, and the sweet potato tots!  We had to try them all.    Husband loved the tacos - I know tacos at a burger joint.  Whatever, accept it and enjoy it!  We are a fan!"}
{"text":"It's all about the sizzle, not the steak, at PVBC.  The burger itself is small and not very flavorful, if you get just a burger and apply pedestrian toppings. There was a bun - not much to say about it.  They're doing a neat thing with the fancy toppings, but when you consider overall value of what you get for your money, combine that with the hype, consider what you can get elsewhere, it's just not worth what you pay.  For the more mathey, that equation looks like this:  $V = ( q+h )  { c   *  or:  dollar value of quality plus hype is less than competition  * no 'less than' symbol for yelp text fields, how lame"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place the other night.  A bit of a hole in the wall, but it was amazing!  Husband and I got the Beach House burger and it was delicious!!!!  Great fries and you must try the maple bacon milkshake, so yummy!!!  Very reasonable prices.  Will definitely be back here soon!"}
{"text":"You should probably get in here soon before everyone else discovers it and it turns into a chain.  WOW good food.  Thanks guys"}
{"text":"LOVE PVBC!   My husband is a die hard hamburger lover. It has taken time for him to get used to my \"eh\" attitude about hamburgers. DON'T HATE ME. But, not only is Paradise Valley Burger Companies burgers amazing, but so are their homemade chips. And for those of you who aren't a huge burger fan, like me, they have a bomb tush grilled cheese.   Check out Paradise Valley Pizza Company too!"}
{"text":"This place is a great local eatery. You can tell they use high-quality ingredients and the atmosphere is very kitschy. I think that if you're in the mood for a burger and fries pretty much any way it can be dressed up this is your place."}
{"text":"Had high hopes and was disappointed. Food was just so so. Not worth finding a parking spot."}
{"text":"Maybe I need to try this place again.   I thought it was just \"okay\" and nothing spectactular.  The meat patty was pretty thing, but it was tasty. The fries were pretty average, nothing special.  Next time I need to try the french toast fries and a milkshake or something.  The building is a small little hole in the wall in a strip mall."}
{"text":"The husband and I arrived at paradise valley burger fifteen minutes prior to when we were meeting with a group of friends for the 1000 review uye. A few people were here when we arrived and the owner was nice enough to accommodate our large party by pushing several tables together. Speaking of the owner, I was very impressed with his fast response to yelp messages and friendly laid back attitude. As I sit here reviewing, a few people have their food and it looks amazing.  The husband and I are sharing the bacon maple shake (5$) which is sooo super indulgent. It's salty, smoky, sweet and good all over, featuring chunks of real bacon and pecans. I could get fat on these babies. Several in the party ordered the famed brulee burger (8$) (fried egg, bacon, bruleed sugar, pickled onion, and thousand island) with the husband ordering the country fried burger (8$ ish) (a fried patty with gravy and crispy onions), and a variety of sides (i had french toast fries (2.50 ish), husband had sweet pot tots (2$ ish), others had fries). I just received my food which includes a brulee burger add jalapeno and French toast fries... It looks ridic. First bite... French toast fries are legit, not those sorry excuses for french toast sticks they sell at burger king. These are straight up crispy French toast pieces covered in powdered sugar and served with syrup. Sorry diet, maybe tomorrow. The husband's tots are fair, but nothing to write home about. His burger is in that same category, fair. We were kind of expecting something crispy (since the patty and the onions were fried and all), but everything was a little soft... The flavor is ok, but  somewhat one note, certainly not the best order at the table.  Everyone else at the table seems pretty happy with their orders and the staff managed to deliver most of the food at the same time (which is especially impressive since everyone ordered at different times). My burger looks great.... Unfortunately, looks can be deceiving... It is good, but not great.. It's a fast food style patty (thin and cooked well done) and the egg is a little runny, but not excessively. The bacon was really yummy and crispy, but not burnt, so that is a plus. I guess the issue is that it just feels like it's missing something... Maybe a fresh element? I can't quite put my finger on it. Don't get me wrong, the burger is good and I would recommend this place if you were in the area (particularly because of the amazing owner and staff here and their general creativity (new specials every week) which is admirable), but maybe not if it's too far out of your way.  PS Roll me out of here! PPS Thanks to all of my dining companions! PPPS Gorillas love milkshakes PPPPS 1000! Hooray!!!"}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise in the hood!   Fast casual concept.  Lickety split service.  I think in terms of flavor \"bang for your buck\" it is spot on.  While the burgers are a bit small-the flavors are large!  Love that you can help yourself to sauces in the fridge.  Fries are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Burgers were outstanding!  What a nice find.  We were at the Mayo clinic seeing my mother-in-law and the kids were starving.  This place came highly recommended so we went.  We were not disappointed!  The fried ice cream was a nice treat also!"}
{"text":"So I hate to even leave a negative review because it was on the food network and Guy is my guy! But.......at the same time, this place is WAY overhyped! I almost feel like people only go here because it was on Triple D. Don't get me wrong, the establishment itself was nice and the staff were friendly but the food wasn't even close to what I expected. I was hyped up off of the food network and even the presentation,but it lacks flavor. I got the booze burger but my burger was majority breaking/batter. The bun is too small for the burger and the burger itself tasted like it had no seasoning. The seasoned fries were good but the portion size was disappointing. My wife got a burger with a fried egg on it that wound up being sunny side up smh. I doubt I would return based on quality of the food and I drove close to 30 minutes coming from Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place was really great! I had a havarti cheeseburger with grilled onions, sweet potato tots with delicious ranch dressing (homemade I think), and a vanilla milkshake with whipped cream on top! Everything was delicious!! My husband had the corn and said it was really good."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times since they opened. I was excited to try it for the first time because I love a good burger! Inside it's a small take out type of place with several seats.     They have a rather eclectic menu - it's not just burgers. They have sandwhiches, tacos, and salads as well. The key to this place is creativity. Each item has a tasty spin on it. In fact they have a Facebook page that they regularly post specials on and each special seems a challenge to top the previous special as most unique.   This visit I did a simple grilled cheese which always hits the spot along with another special, the pretzel fries. Those were really good but don't get too excited as it may not be available if you stop in. My son got the bistro burger and fries. Looked amazing.  Here is why I give it 4 and not 5 stars though: I would give them them a 5 for creativity alone but I feel the bang for your buck isn't there. I would go more often but I feel it's a little too pricey for what you get. Portions are rather small. For example, the special this week...which don't get me wrong sounds impressive, is $8.50 just for the burger. Sides are seperate. My son ordered a milkshake which comes in one size and with a $5 price tag. Pricey! So for us we come here every once in a while when we need something different and are willing to pay for it...and aren't ravenous."}
{"text":"This place is too legit....  I mean damn man, who is the mastermind who comes up with these ideas? Then to be able to execute a freakin Brulee Burger on the reg... It's just amazing. Your freaking fries taste like lays BBQ chips which is in itself a miracle.   Don't get my fat ass started on that Lucky Charms shake either, I almost left my wife because she drank it all.   You guys are the best and an awesome local business. This is what makes Phoenix great!   Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"It was good. I was hopping for awesome but good is good.  I try to go to any place on DDD. The burger was good."}
{"text":"Second time at Paradise Burgers. Arrived a bit after 1:00 on a Friday and place was still packed. Had the Paradise Burger, Son had the Bacon Cheese Burger with Sweet Potato Tater Tots. Food was great. Service was a bit slow and perhaps off of their \"A\" game. One customer got their burger with only half a bun. Another customer did not get bacon  on their bacon burger. Ours had all the parts. Can't beat the quality of food....will be back. Lots of choices."}
{"text":"My 5th time here, waited till I tried enough times, so I made an accurate review. One word. Amazing. Nothing fancy, but I have been sorely disappointed at some \"fancy\" places. Brulee is awesome. Today I just got bacon chz burger. Delicious. Best burger place around."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from the outside but wow, what a treat on the inside! This place is what all local burger joints should be - tasty, original, good value, unique. I had the brûlée burger and French toast fries - never had anything like it! A tastebud sensation. Next time I come back I'll get something a little less sweet, but this was a real delight."}
{"text":"Words cant describe! Had the Burgers are surprisingly light. Brule Burger was a epic explosion in my mouth! Phenomenal burger. The Shrimp Club sandwich was tasty and amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  Just finished my takeout beach burger, already want to go back and get another.  Added the carmelized onions and it was fantastic.  Fries were also really great!"}
{"text":"Love this local burger place.  Found myself craving the burgers in such a way that I HAD to come back.  Great food!!! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Some of the best fast food burgers I think  I've had. The only drawback was the guy had no patience when trying to order off such a huge menu. The burger was huge and juicy bun was great. In town for a week will try to hit this place again for another one burger before I split. This place is that good."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  My wife and I tried it based on the other positive reviews on Yelp, and we were not disappointed.  I had the paradise bacon CHZ burger with cheddar cheese and jalapeno ranch dressing.  The burger came with lettuce, tomato, some variety of onion that was unusual and cucumber too.  The bun was thin, light and toasted - I found it to be a much better bun than your typical dense, soggy burger bun.  The burger consisted of two very thin patties and had a nice grilled taste.  I've eaten a lot of burgers in the valley, and this was a very tasty burger.    My wife got the paradise CHZ burger and subbed in a portobello mushroom for the burger.  She said this is her favorite burger place in the valley and she wants to go back.  I take that as a serious endorsement from someone who generally does not like burgers.    We also each ordered the sweet potato tater tots and those were good too.  For drinks, we both opted for glasses of water, and they offered water with cucumber which was very satisfying, and much better than the typical nasty tap water you find most places.  The staff was super friendly and it was quiet inside so we could carry on a conversation easily.  Our total tab was just under $20.  We will definitely go back and I'm going to try one of their milkshakes next time.    Unpretentious, great food, great value for money, relaxing environment and friendly staff.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Came at Lunch time, place was mildly busy. forgot that i have been here before and didn't care to much for the place. ordered a burger and fries, service was swift and friendly. Burger was good! would have probably enjoyed a different one better just because of what i like on burgers. i ordered the specialty Burger called the Country Fried Burger. it was good, but it didn't fill me up, there was two small patty's on it, tomato, lettuce and onion strings. definitely yummy, but not the best I've ever had. Fries were perfect. Place was rather bland in decor, kind of clean... but i'm here for the food! so i don't care. nice little hole in the wall place with lots of good reviews, see if it's right for you:)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great burgers. Shakes were just ok and fries a tad salty but still good. Kinda a hole in the wall place but very clean."}
{"text":"I really liked the burger I had here. It's a little small but the flavors are great.   I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and there were pickled onions which added a really nice touch.  A little pricey, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Popped in for a try today.  Got the paradise bacon burger with fries and a water $12.  Lil more than I like to spend on a burger but it was really good.  Double burger was fresh..not greasy and well seasoned.  Bacon was crisp and tasty.  There were also i believe pickled onions as well as fresh lettuce, pickles and tomato on a fresh buttered n grilled bun.  Fries were crispy and had great seasoning.  They have some specialty burgers on the menu I would like to try next time im in the area."}
{"text":"WOW, If you look good food this is the spot.  If you like food that is a bit different then run of the mill this is the spot.   If you are the kind of person who is willing to try something you normally wouldn't put together.  This is the spot.  Trust in the opinion of the professionals, try the burger of the week.  Also try a milkshake!  Ive come to the conclusion Bret is a genious."}
{"text":"This place was great.  We tried the chips, fries, and tater tots with our burgers and have no complaints.  The price is great and other than I wish the burger patty was bigger I love this place!"}
{"text":"What deliciousness!! My wife and I met for lunch here just the other day. It was our first visit, but it won't be our last. The country fried and bacon cheeseburger were both excellent. Can't believe we've been in Phoenix 3 years and just got around to eating here now. If you're a burger fan, they won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Good selection of music, with the volume just right.  One of the things i noticed was  the on the burgers I had, there was the perfect ratio of bread and burger.  No chocking down a bun and feeling overstuffed.  The sweet potato tots are of the things that make you wonder \" Why did this take so long to be invented?\"  Five stars, and I don't give them out frivolously."}
{"text":"Brûlée burger. You are everything that I want in a burger. The Paradise Valley Burger Company understands my palate and, dare I say, my soul? The menu is inventive and irreverent, and the establishment is unpretentious. Our food came surprisingly quick. We ordered a couple Frankensteins, a few brûlées, French toast fries, regular fries, and a kids meal... everyone was happy. I took one bite, and a sort of frenzy set in. I couldn't take big enough bites (seriously, see attached picture) or roll my eyes back hard enough to convey to the people in my group who somehow managed to keep chatting about some pumpkin patch pictures how immediately they needed to stop talking and experience this burger. This is my favorite burger. All other burgers I've had in the past? I have forgotten you."}
{"text":"A true gem of the north valley. I have yet to go here and have a bad experience. Try the tacos. My personal favorite is the beef fresco style. Keep up the good work, and maybe open a Tempe location."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I've had period. I've been to this burger place a few times now and look forward to each time I'm in the area so I can stop by an eat the best burger in town. Do yourself a favor and go. Your taste buds will thank you!!"}
{"text":"Yes, the place seems a little run down, but their burgers are out of this world. I've had a few different burgers off of their menu, as well as a chicken sandwich, and they're all top notch. Fries are good and I'm told the French toast fries are amazing.  If you're a big eater like me, I'd recommend adding another patty to your burger as they're smaller than other places."}
{"text":"Went to see what all the hubbub was about and I will say the burgers were delicious I ordered the steak fried burger which was delicious and not as greasy as I expected(which is a good thing) however I wish there was more meat because I was still hungry after spending $8 on one burger, so it's not very cost effective.    Overall review great taste but don't come here starving."}
{"text":"Always great service when we come in! The burgers are yummy but my fave thing on the menu is the lucky charms milkshake. It. Is. Everything. MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Great place, inspired burgers.  Love the malt shakes as well.  Always surprised by the imaginative specials.  Brûlée burger is my favorite!"}
{"text":"At first glance, this location does not look appealing! It's a whole in the wall location, but we all know some times those places are the best, this is one of those times. The food was fantastic! I had the Beach Burger and some fries with pulled pork, jalapenos, pico de gallo...It had a name, can't remember what it was, doesn't matter, cuz it was delishcooltastic! In the words of the best political figure ever...\"I'll be back!!\" The only reason it is getting 4 stars is 1) I'm kind of jerk and 2) it was very tight eating quarters!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time at PV Burger Company tonight.  It was quiet, only one table when I got there around 6:20pm.  Ordered a bacon havarti burger with fries and a coke; it came out to just over 9 bucks.    The burger came with lettuce, tomato, cucumber (???), pickled red onions, and thousand island.  It was DELICIOUS.  Beautifully toasted bun, great char on the meat.  The pickled onions were a nice touch.  The fries were skinny and crispy and had seasoned salt, which brings me back to being a kid and getting fries at the food court in the mall (good memories).  I got a refill on my coke before I left, so I don't know what another reviewer was talking about when they said there are no refills on sodas.  I asked and it was no problem.  My only gripe is that after I had ordered and sat down to wait for my food, a couple of guys came in and the guy at the counter immediately handed them paper menus (with actual descriptions of the menu items I'm sure, unlike the chalkboard on the wall), which I would have liked.  I probably would have gotten an add-on for my burger if he had given me a paper menu when I was at the counter.  Oh well, now I know for next time, because there will definitely be a next time in the near future :)"}
{"text":"Interesting burger place. They make some strange burgers like peanut butter and jelly burger I had the brulee burger which was quite tasty. Fries were good as well"}
{"text":"This is the best Burger in N Phx. They have new specials here every week and that's what I usually get. Their jalapeno ranch and sriracha ketchup are good with their fries. The shakes are excellent, but they need thicker straws :)  I usually pick up from either the burger or pizza spot once a week, a Paradise addict."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local restaurant and I don't even eat burgers. The pulled veggie sandwich and the interesting milkshakes never let me down. The service has never been anything but friendly and fast, and I always take my out-of-town friends and family there."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food. First time in, i had the country fried burger and it was soooo delicious. Also tried the lucky charm marshmallow shake, freaking amazing. I'll be coming here at least once a week, every week"}
{"text":"This place is overrated since on tv... ok burgers but over priced for quality and flavor I had the diablo burger very greasy no seasoning on the meat and thin patties with soggy bun.... not impressed not to mention no one wipes the tables down so pretty filthy"}
{"text":"My husband and I have a thing for burgers... Let me tell you if you get the bun right and the burger we love it!!! We loved the soft bun toasted perfectly on the inside and the burgers were so delicious, a little small for my husband but perfect size for me! The fries had a very interesting seasoning and I think a little sugar mixed in surprisingly a delightful twist of that is what it was!"}
{"text":"The burgers were really good and I especially liked the seasoned french fries. The atmosphere was relaxed with good music.  The big negative was cleanliness. Flies and others bugs were all over."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers! Cheap prices with an upscale taste. French toast fries?! Who doesn't want that?! Quick and friendly service, definitely a local business I'll be visiting weekly!!!! Coming back tomorrow for the chocolate covered potato chip milkshake:)"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers.  The pickled (?) onions add such a great layer of flavor.  The sweet potato tater tots were perfect.  The fries were amazing, we tried the \"seasoned\" version and they were so good.  The shake of the day was a Coco Puff malt so delicious!   Friendly staff, clean and welcoming.  Packed to the brim so luckily it was nice enough to sit outside to eat!  We will be sure to go back again!"}
{"text":"My husband and myself decided to pictures of to participate in what all the hype was about... we get to this location it's hidden in a small little strip mall, get inside friendly service right away atmosphere very comfortable very casual lots of to look at on the walls finally got our food so it came out fabulous he ordered the French toast fries and portabello mushroom burger and their famous brewle. This is truly the best burger place I've ever been to in phoenix compliments to the Creator."}
{"text":"Not your ordinary burger! Don't come here expecting your classic old fashioned burger, these are one of a kind, haven't tried anything else like it! Can't wait to try their other style burgers too!"}
{"text":"OMFG The food here is outrageously delicious and fairly priced for the unique ways they present the humble burger.   Also, save room for dessert -- specifically their Maple Bacon Milkshake."}
{"text":"Always good, never disappointing. Feel free to add something on top...they won't mind. The whole menu is very good. I don't think I would ever have a shake with breakfast cereal in it, but you have to give them credit for creativity. The staff is relaxed and friendly. I just can't think of anything negative to say. If you are at Chase Field, don't miss their concession."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Been coming here for the past three years and never once have I been disappointed. I bring all my friends that come to visit and even have a few friends that only come to visit so they can grab a burger from this place. The staff is a solid group of guys as well. The burlee is my go to, but their specials are always incredible."}
{"text":"Great little place, always busy, the burgers are great, the pickled onions on their burgers are the best part of it."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch for what I thought was gonna be a quick bite. I quickly realized this place is very popular and I would be there for 20 minutes just waiting for my to go order. Its a little hole in the wall restaurant and all the tables were taken inside, the lines wraps around inside, so your pretty packed in there. I got a bacon cheeseburger with green chiles and after seeing several people order lucky charms milkshake I had to be a follower and try one too.   Like I said I waited about 20 minutes to get my chow and in the meantime they handed me my milkshake. I had to say I wasn't entirely impressed with it. I mean I love lucky charms and I like vanilla ice cream but just mixing them together and charging as much as they do was a let down. The burger and fries were a completely different story.. I fell in love with the burger, it was just juicy and flavorful. The fries were a tad bit overseasoned for my liking but it didn't keep me from eating them all!. The ranch they have is thicker and I wanted to back to get some and take it home. Id definitely go back and try a different burger of theirs. They have so many different options."}
{"text":"Every time i go there they have something new and every time I am blown away how amazing their burgers are. Prices are great as well as very friendly customer service, if you haven't gone yet go now!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! One of a kind burgers. And it's a very relaxed environment. I'm a forever customer."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch today... I saw the Burger sign outside and thought I would try it out. WOW!! This place is amazing. The owner/chef was taking the orders and was super helpful and friendly. I had a Paradise CHZ which came with 2 patties, smoked mozzarella lettuce, tomato, caramelized onion as well as cucumber. I also ordered  Sweet Potato Tater Tots I was blown away! BEST BURGERS IN PHOENIX!  Our bill came to $18 for 2 cheese burgers, 2 sides and a soda.  It was so amazing I went back for dinner. I bragged to much when I got home that my boyfriend just had to try it. I had the special which was a Roasted Duck Burger (2 beef patties, topped with roasted duck, caramelized onions, bacon, fried egg over easy served with duck au jus) By far the best burger of my life. My boyfriend got the Beach House (2 beef patties. roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella, pico de gallo and jalapeno ranch) He also ordered the seasoned fries. I don't care for fires and I think I could eat 3 orders they were so good. His was so good he ordered another burger.  For Desert we shared a Maple Pecan Bacon Milkshake, also to die for. I really think I need one of these every night. From the atmosphere, the music, the staff to the food every thing about PV Burgers was a hit. This is a must go!"}
{"text":"The burgers are really flavorful! They have plenty of great combinations you can chose from. This is a great place you can go and sit down with friends. And get a quick jucy burger. I'm a chief and I know good food. The French frys are sweet and salty and I think about them all the time. If you plan on going there around lunch time. Be prepared to wait in a line out the door."}
{"text":"Very good burger joint. Had the Cinco Diablo burger. Tasty and spicy. The entire staff is super friendly as well.  Only place you also may want to try is Rocket Burger on the west side, but PV Burger Co. is  much closer to where I live/work."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers, delish fries, great service!!!  My husband had the special, the West Sider, delicious! I had the Beach burger, great! Everything we ordered was so yummy!  We Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in a while- I got the beach burger and loved it. The fries were incredible too!"}
{"text":"In light of the present 2016 political scene, I along with my family stopped in for an early supper at PV Burger. The hostess asked what I wanted. I said the \"politician\"..she said what's that ?..I said, Chicken, chipotle sauce, lettuce, tomato, bacon, cheese, egg, fries on a toasted bun. She said, \"we can do that\". It was served along with the rest of the order promptly, properly prepared, messy but delicious.."}
{"text":"Really great I got a Beach Burger to go with fries.  Their fries are seasoned in a sweet and salty way with a bit of a kick I really liked them.  The burger was great, loved the bread.  Food was served up fast."}
{"text":"Great original burger combos. We had the Burger Brulee and Sloppy Joe burgers with a side of corn on the cob. All excellent."}
{"text":"Small burger restaurant with no frills but good food.  Was previously a two hippies place that just did not take off.  Shared the Brulee Burger,  homemade chips and french toast fries. All were excellent,  the Brulee Burger comes on a brioche bun with bacon and eggs along with pink onions and burnt sugar and havarti. Great taste of all mixed together. Not a giant burger but good enough in size, quality not quantity.   The pleasant surprise was the french toast fries with syrup. Fried Egg Bread looks like a fresh cut fries but are perfectly cooked.  The homemade chips are also very good and only $1.  Great price for your meal and quality food.  Located on 40th Street and Bell Road, if I worked at PV Hospital or attended PV High School I would be there way too much.  Will certainly come back and bring the rest of the family."}
{"text":"Awesome and right around the corner! Beach burger is so good! And they have sweet potatoe tater tots! Also they always have amazing looking specials they post on face book. Have yet to try..but they always make me salivate! Craving a good cheap quick burger its your place! Not coporate chain = good food & good service!  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is unreal. If you watch the show \"Bob's Burgers\" I feel this is like the real life equivalent. The restaurant is nothing impressive to look at--a simple counter, a few tables inside, and a whiteboard with changing specials that have fun names.  But man, the food that comes out of that kitchen is next level. I discovered and tried it for the first time on a Tuesday and by Sunday I had eaten there 3 times. Every burger or specialty sandwich I've had is outrageously good. The toppings/fixins pair so well with the style of burger or sandwich you order. Cucumbers on a cheeseburger? It's the best thing you never knew you wanted. The food you get will be far more of a culinary experience than you were expecting.  Oh, and do yourself a favor and get a milkshake too, like the Bacon Maple Pecan shake, it tastes like breakfast and dessert in the same cup."}
{"text":"Beat burgers in phoenix!!! Ive been here several times and I have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"This was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.   I got the Texas Burger. Really good. The BBQ sauce increases the savoriness of the patty and makes it seem even juicier. The peppers complement the meat.   Tacos are really good too. The chicken is tender. The sauce on this also fits. The fried onions give it extra texture and depth without being too strong."}
{"text":"First time here, food was great! I wish they served a few beers, the perfect Saturday or Sunday recovery lunch. I would definitely add a 3rd patty to my burger next time."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise.  Don't let the unassuming strip mall scare you away, burger paradise lies within."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers where the size of the burger doesn't matter much.  The patties are smaller than you would normally get, but the ingredients that are used make each burger unique.  I had the burger with the egg on top and it was such a nice addition.  I am always a fan when you utilize an egg on a burger.  Combines my favorite meal of the day with a burger.  Location is fairly small and it always seems like it is busy when we were there, but they bring out the food in a timely manner.  Definitely a place to come back to!"}
