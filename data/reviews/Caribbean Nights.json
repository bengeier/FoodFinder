{"text":"So glad I stumbled onto this new hidden gem recently.   Have lived in the area for years but never ventured into this plaza until a couple weeks ago.  This unassuming and warm little restaurant and bar has easily the hands-down best chicken wings for miles and miles around!  Not the small chinsy type bits you get from the nearby Pizza joints either ... Some real meat on these ones.  Definitely will be stopping by often for their Tuesday special on those.  My fav so far is the BBQ flavor.  They also come in plain, suicide, honey garlic and Jerk(!)  Most of their menu focusses on Indo Caribbean and Chinese style food. Have tried the Curry Chicken with rice and was favourably impressed.  My company really enjoyed their roti as well.  Left curious to try their other offerings.  The service here has to be mentioned and commended.   Extremely, friendly and attentive going above and beyond to make sure we felt very satisfied and welcome.  A welcome addition to the area ... I hope they do well and stick around."}
{"text":"Amazing customer  service  they actually go the extra mile to make sure you enjoy your food. If you order spicy food try the peppershrimp its sooo gooodd and affrodable"}
{"text":"The Pepper shrimp is out of this world, but be prepared... it is spicy! Excellent service; I was served immediately and with a smile. The drink and food were brought quickly. Great portion sizes! The jerk chicken wings are also a hit."}
{"text":"1. Go there 2. Get their spicy chicken wings.   Price so lovely. We 6 people spent around $10 for each of us. Got Tuesday wings special too: 10 pieces for $5.99. Way more worth it than St Louise.  Other recommendations: pepper shrimp, curry with Roti."}
