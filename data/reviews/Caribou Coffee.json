{"text":"I was devastated to learn my local Caribou Coffee was closing down, as the franchise was bought out by a group of suits and is being closed to make room for something else. Caribou personally holds a lot of great memories for me with my friends and girlfriend. That's why, after mine closed, I had to trek down one of the three remaining stores in the Charlotte/Lake Norman area... Almost 30 miles away.

If you don't care about all that and want to know what makes it great, their coffees are excellent (I quite enjoy their blended frozen coffees) and the employees are so friendly. This one isn't as cozy and relaxed as mine in Mooresville was, but there are plenty of open spaces to work/lounge and free Wi-Fi. Plus it's got a feel to it that makes it, just... Special.

I can't stand Starbucks honestly, so Caribou is one of those rare gems that stands out among the dozens of soulless green-and-white logo coffee shops all over the place. Caribou has not only great coffee, it's got personality. It's a shame those are usually the first to go in this dog-eat-dog capitalist society.

Here's to you, Caribou Coffee. I raise my blended turtle mocha in your honor. Thanks for everything. And as long as there is one Caribou Coffee standing, I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"I've been to this Caribou Coffee a fair few times. In fact, I'm writing in it right now (I really hate being \"that guy on the laptop\"...). The place is very clean an well maintained with very friendly and efficient staff, who clearly love doing what they do. There's a charm to the place which is reminiscent of independent coffee shops, but falls a little bit short of achieving it. There's a daily trivia question above the counter which if you answer correctly, you get a dime off your order, and the staff address you as an actual person as opposed to a customer; but there's something about the place which makes it feel like an experience manicured to feel like an independent coffee shop.

Nevertheless, there's a good selection of coffee available for purchase, along with seasonal specials. Around Christmas time I tried the eggnog latte (or the 'Fa-la-latte' as they called it, and as I called it forgoing a shred of my masculinity in the process). I usually have a milk chocolate mocha, which strikes a nice balance between the sweetness of the chocolate and the bitterness of the coffee, not veering too much towards either side. They also include a chocolate covered coffee bean with it, which is a nice touch.

There's a nice, if somewhat limited selection of foods, but this is understandable since there's a Bruegger's bagels literally opposite the counter. The sweets that Caribou do are great, not too rich, but a nice treat to go alongside your drink.

One of my few qualms about the place would probably be the prices. A small mocha is just shy of $4, which is pretty pricey for what you get (the coffee is nice, but not THAT nice).

Overall, a nice place to kill an hour or two with a friend of partner. The atmosphere is pleasant, and the background music is usually pretty good (no cheesy chart music and no Starbucks middle of the road Norah Jones inspired boring melodies)."}
{"text":"This isn't a cozy coffee shop, but it is a great place to get some work done or meet up with a friend or client. It's a nice place to be during the day, with the front wall of windows keeping it bright. A lot of people stay there for hours using it as an office with no mean looks from the staff. And Bruegger's is right there if you get hungry!
The music is a little random, and sometimes the phone conversations are a little overbearing, but most of my experiences here have been very pleasant."}
{"text":"Love this coffee shop! They coffee is great. The staff are friendly. Lots of places to sit. 

My go to is the campfire mocha milk chocolate and 2% milk. (half syrup and chocolate)! 

Check the black board for the $.10 off trivia question.  Also sign up for their perks card, who doesn't love free stuff. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just a note to let you know about the wonderful location on Park Road, Charlotte. This is not just a coffee shop as its office to many who work remotely or are on the road. They have a huge sitting area with free wifi. Caribou has been my 2nd \"office\" for some time now. This location has the best customer service, atmosphere and management team in the entire city of Charlotte. I can't speak highly enough about the manager Todd who runs this Caribou, and fully understands what it takes to engage with customers. You don't find places like this very often so when you do you know to appreciate it."}
{"text":"Love this espresso! They are the best major coffee chain. Their competitors load down their drinks with to much milk and sugar."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewer regarding making a left turn (west) onto Bagley.  It is a very busy road, especially during rush hours.  Another issue I have with the location is that it seems almost hidden.  There is a large tree in front and even though I've been there many times, I drive right past.  It shares a building with Chipotle, that's how I typically find it.  

Inside it is small.  No easy way to sit privately.  Not comfortable enough to sit and work or read for an hour or more.  Also it's noisy.  Not sure if it's the acoustics or the staff is just loud, but sitting in the front of the shop I can hear every word / story / sing-a-long they are saying.  

All that said about this location, I don't think you can beat Caribou's coffee.  It's never bitter or burnt tasting like other coffee chains.  The food is decent, although sometimes I wish these places would not try to be so fancy or maybe pretentious about the sandwiches.  A simple egg and cheese on toast would be great."}
{"text":"Ive been going there to study for the pat two weeks after work, and so far Ive hadn't had any complaints of this establishment. I always get the cappuccino w/ soy and its made perfect every single time. The staff there are very knowledgeable of what they have to offer. The size is a bit on the smaller end but the atmosphere is always pleasant. 4 stars just because of the size here other than that they are good to go in my book!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE CARIBOU COFFEE!!!!! If you love flavored coffee, this is the place to be. I also prefer their regular black coffee over Starbucks black coffee. Starbucks over roast their coffee beans and it leaves a really bad burnt after taste. Caribou coffee is really smooth. 

My one and only drink that I order is the Turtle Mocha with Milk Chocolate! I love it iced or hot! The hot version taste almost like a hot chocolate with expresso shots.

Staff is super nice at this location, the ONLY complaint is there are certain bartistas that make the drinks perfectly and I only encounter 2 bartistas that didn't meet up to par but I figured maybe they're new. I'm pretty sure they would make my drink over again but I just never stick around long enough to try my coffee before I leave."}
{"text":"Located on the right side of the large space (with Bruegger's bagels on the left) with plenty of seating. This space is great for busy weekends or working on your laptop or meeting friends. I love Caribou's teas, especially the Tropical Green one. The best part about their tea is one free refill! They also make great latte's. I like their almond milk as a sub as well. The employees are always extremely friendly and kind."}
{"text":"Always great attitudes and smiling employees. Never had a bad experience here. Love that they offer almond milk as an option!"}
{"text":"Lovze the coffee..need i say more? Friendly staff and great product. Perfect for after dinner or just to go grab a quick cup."}
{"text":"The wifi's still free but they changed my beloved Mocha!  Now you have to pick white chocolate, dark chocolate or milk chocolate.  And they got really snarky when I asked which one tastes like the original.  

So I tried the milk chocolate and it just doesn't taste the same at all.  The dark chocolate is the closest and really doesn't taste like dark chocolate which is good for me and my coffee preferences.  But isn't it false advertising if it doesn't taste \"dark\"?

Especially for a non-dairy person, why'd you have to go and mess with the program just before Christmas?

My final complaint is they close at 5pm on Sundays which is really annoying.  They're always kicking about 10 people out and people are still trying to come in and they alway ask \"Are they closed already?\""}
{"text":"This Bou I feel like I need to give somewhere between 2-4 stars.  The employees are always very nice, but they often have to be told...exactly how I want my drink made, and they don't always follow directions well
I stop here often because it is close to where I live.  I study here from time to time too.  My worry is that Caribou is getting more concerned w/ making food than great coffee.
I'll keep going back because it isn't bad, but it is def.not 5 star worthy."}
{"text":"Caribou is the best for cold brew....hands down! I got a medium french vanilla cold brew today and it was a little off with the flavoring....but the barista had no issue with remaking it for me. They are the bestest! Thx Caribou"}
{"text":"What can you say about a chain coffee shop? It's decent enough beverages, extremely overpriced. I stop in if I happen to be in the shopping center, or after a run along the greenway that runs behind the shopping center, but otherwise would not go out of my way to get coffee here. The staff is always super friendly, though, and that counts for something."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for some drinks and it was my first time. They have a pretty large space, plenty of room to study, have meetings, and just hang out. It's causal and clean and any coffee nut should give it a try! Our drinks were delicious, the only problem I had was that the prices were a bit high. I know there is constant competition with coffee businesses but even other companies that cost more have better prices. 
Other than that we were pretty satisfied!!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, the draw to get me here is a bagel from their adjoining neighbors. Although once I'm in, I'm hooked. 

The employees are friendly and fast making my special lattes. If you are like me, I don't like solid things in my drinks. Be warned, some of their sugary drinks have bits of chocolate to make it fancy. However, they are happy to please and make your drink to your liking. 

They offer a meeting room in the back. You just have to reserve it and pay a small fee (you'll get plenty of coffee for the fee). Free WiFi too!

Great location and always busy. Careful in the parking lot (this is a scary, crammed lot full of people and cars buzzing around all the time)."}
{"text":"Ok, so after checking out more local places I have to update my review. I used to stop by here everyday it seemed, but they got rid of all the original staff- which blows. The new manager is not nearly as friendly and every time she makes my cappuccino it tastes burned...might as well go to Starbucks for that taste. And I always receive less than half. I pay for a medium but get a small. Any other place I've gone to gives me the full medium amount- I don't get it. I'd have to say I'll be checking out more local brews from now on. And FYI- if you want good cappuccino or espresso try Rush Espresso."}
{"text":"I LOVE there coffee here. However I was here at 10:30 on a Saturday morning and it was not that busy.  the person at the cash register was very very slow. I saw 3 people leave the line and Brueghers went through a 20 person line when Caribou did 4 small orders. The coffee makers were fast but the cashier was holding everyone up."}
{"text":"This is not a very friendly, quick,  or spacious Caribou Coffee. The service feels like a fast-food restaurant. Everyone is wearing the required headsets and stating the latest scripting from corporate headquarters. Caribou has a lot of dessert inspired coffees and should be treated as such. If you order any chocolate-flavored coffee they use scoopfuls of chocolate chips in the bottom,  the end result is a melty, oily, chocolate chip mess at the bottom of your drink. The oatmeal is good, but again, too over-sugared with a fruity compote. Have been to other locations around the country and the ambience and service is much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to have some coffee and relax a bit. However the prices are much too high for what you order and receive. $6 for a blended coffee? You can get the same for under $4 at Starbucks. And the taste and everything else is not anything exciting or original."}
{"text":"It was ok for being close to the office. It was a little disarray paper on floor bathroom was in need of attention. There  was 3 people a head of me and it took only 5 min to get my iced coffee. They ladies behind the counter where friendly and very professional and very proficient in their getting the orders right."}
{"text":"Main reason to come here was to have coffee or tea in normal mug, that was a pleasant surprise amid total ubiquitous paper-cup fast food connept.
Guess what, they apparently are loosing that. Last couple times they \"didn't have\" mugs, and if they don't find a way to get more, they are loosing me as a customer. (Not that it's much of anybody's concern \")"}
{"text":"First time I tried caribou coffee was at the Park road location In Charlotte.
I spent almost $5 on a latte that was waaaaaaaaay too sweet. I love sweets but this was unbearable. And they don't offer whole milk, stuck with crappy diet milk. Yuck."}
{"text":"I would normally only give this location a three star rating: the coffee is good, as Caribou's tends to be, and the staff is friendly, but this store really does lack Caribou's trademark coziness (mostly due to sharing space with a Breuggers, which I find odd, since they serve coffee as well).

However, I am upgrading this joint to four stars due to the excellent service they gave me today!  It has been very icy here in Charlotte, and my ceramic travel mug was quite cold this morning.  The barista noticed and offered to heat it up with hot water before filling it!  Very thoughtful of her."}
{"text":"This location is a few things taking away from more stars... The Location and the Clientele.  

Lets start with the mess of a parking situation... If you are trying to get out of this lot during anything other than wayyyy late at night you will be waiting. Don't think you won't, Bagley is much too busy for a quick in and out trip. 

And second is the annoying people that come in here.  Why you gotta be so loud? I don't mind you talking/chilling/laughing.. but try to control your levels somewhat. 

As for the staff, they are usually pretty nice.  The drinks are ok. The food here doesn't seem up to par as other coffeeshops.  

One great thing though, free Refills on Brewed Coffee/Teas"}
{"text":"Prompt and friendly service. Perfect dark chocolate mochas. Seating area has good mix of table, chairs and counter height surfaces."}
{"text":"Removed one star because they keep charging for whipped cream. Also the tiny amount you receive is not worth the extra $0.70! For less than $3 I can go to the supermarket and buy a gigantic can of extra creamy whipped cream. This is bad corporate policy."}
{"text":"The music here is so spastic and random, I actually heard Nancy Sinatra go into Jack Johnson, wow!  I do like the quiet atmosphere, it is a great place to come after a long day and just surf the internet or read a novel.  

The great thing about this particular location is that it is shared by a Bruegger's Bagels, so it is a nice place to get started for the day as well.  People have business meetings here, I saw a few college-types busting out the books, and a few caffeine freaks as well.  

The dimly lit room's peaceful setting erupted however when I heard two men having a business transaction near my booth.  A Caucasian gentlemen complimented his Asian business partner on his handshake.  \"Nice handshake\", he said.  \"Not many orientals have strong handshakes.\"  What a rash generalization.  I wanted to reach out and slap the man.  

Besides this, I liked the spot.  Would somebody turn off the Lenny Kravitz!"}
{"text":"Why oh why are there so few Caribou coffee places left- when obviously they truly are the best coffee places around! Having found one here while visiting Charlotte- not only does it have great seating but its attached to Brueggers bagels! Heaven and earth combo. On this beautiful day it would be great to have more seating outside- but we managed to snag the comfy leather chairs. I have Been spending a lot more time at Starbucks because of losing my beloved Caribou- so today I got the chance to compare Caribou white chocolate pumpkin to Starbucks pumpkin latte! Caribou wins the pumpkin prize hands down. The best coffee ever and the nicest people. Maybe Caribou should do more combo places- save the brand and keep serving your loyal following!"}
{"text":"Disappointed they don't offer any gluten free options, as there are plenty of people who would like it. 

However my first experience here was very pleasant. The store is split between a coffee shop and Bruegger bagels. It's very open and there is plenty of seating! I was torn between the two sides and only selected the coffee area because the line was shorter (I was in a hurry). But the bagel side seemed to be poppin' so I can't wait to go back and give the food a try!

Oh and my pumpkin white chocolate mocha is on POINT!"}
{"text":"Must try: campfire mocha. It's a s'more in a cup! I'm a tea drinker and there are plenty of options for hot tea as well as different iced tea options both sweet and unsweetened! 

This Caribou is in park road shopping center and shares it's space with brueggers bagels. Super convenient location and low key seating area, good place to study!"}
{"text":"Service is good, place is clean, but this location is connected to Bruegger's and not cozy like Caribou's normally are. Good for a business coffee, not good for date night coffee. Only 2 leather chairs for cuddling up in and they go fast!"}
{"text":"Four years later, this Caribou is still chugging along strong. And they still share the location with Bruegger's. On a weekend morning, there was quite the queue over there for bagels, but the coffee was quick and easy. And it is still pretty good coffee.

Surprising that it's still here, as most of the other Caribous in Charlotte have shut down."}
{"text":"I love Caribou's coffee so if that is what your looking for definitely stop by. However, if it is wi-fi you need, it tends to be slow and logs you off pretty frequently."}
{"text":"They need to train the staff better on how to respond to clients.  They are not busy and the clerk could not take the time to tell me the different oatmeals they serve she just pointed at the board. That is just lazy.  I was the Only person inline."}
{"text":"Love the coffee..
Started going to this location when the ones closer to me closed.  The staff is always nice to me, the turtle mocha is GREAT, this is the only oatmeal I will eat.   
Wish they could have the sandwich options they had at the other locations, but I really go for the coffee!!"}
{"text":"I'm glad this Caribou location has not met its end just yet.  I know a bunch in the area closed down not to long ago, but this one is still going strong.  Could be because of the joint venture/shared space with Brugger's bagels.

There's a large common dining space with tables/chairs/ booths... a good use of space since you got Caribou on the right side and bagel place on the left.  The space still has the injection of Caribou quirk in it.. warm woods... unique decor... I have  yet to see a cute stuffed animal head mounted on the wall here, but they could just be me missing it somewhere.

Staff are super friendly and they keep \"their side\" nice and tidy... well really the whole space is pretty clean.

I haven't stuck around too long, but I assume they offer wifi since I see a ton of people with laptops doing the \"coffeehouse thing.\"  Plenty of parking in Park Rd shopping center.... just be careful since it can get pretty busy with people running their errands and going to and from."}
{"text":"This isn't the Caribou I normally head to but I it was on my way to something else and it shares a space with Bruegger's so I could have coffee and breakfast in one place.

While it's not the most intimate place, the coffee is consistent like any other Caribou.  The staff is friendly and efficient and the store is convienent to everything else in Park Rd Shopping Center.   It's a place to get in an out of quick but I can't say I'd want to sit here and enjoy my coffee."}
{"text":"Why does this place rock? It's not a Starbucks! Haha no really this is a nice coffee joint with ample seating and a bagel shop in the same place. This is one the cooler shopping strip malls in the area. You've got this great coffee shop, a bike shop, a bunch of other eateries, a movie theater, an outdoor gear store, other shopping places and even a hardware store. It's why this Caribou coffee is still here, just a perfect location. 

The coffee was great and the baristas were quick. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong...I LOVE Caribou.  What I don't like is how messy & dirty this one is.  They cut something out of the wall several months ago & they STILL haven't cleaned up the dust from it or filled in whatever it was they cut out.  It shares space with Bruegger's which is nice.  Usually Bruegger's is just as messy with crap on the floor, on the chair seats on the table tops, on the counters (Caribou, too).  It seems Bruegger's has done some housekeeping or refurbishing recently, but really it's just a germy mess.  p.s.  if you're going to this Caribou, please practice your parallel parking skills first (ladies!!! stop giving us a bad name!).  Also, when you're walking up to it, if you see someone parking, please don't walk in front of or behind someone trying to park their car.  People do this all the time & it amazes me that people aren't getting hit.  I guess the people parking are paying more attention than the one's walking."}
{"text":"You'll never go to Starbucks again.. The Park Road location is another great example of why. I would say it is the atmosphere, the great wifi, the ease of getting more food from Bruger's Bagels who shares the same space as them.. the reality is. It's the coffee. Plain and simple. I enjoy sipping my coffee and wondering the shops of the Plaza. Great location.. great people."}
{"text":"I always thought I didn't like Caribou Coffee based on this one Keurig pod I tried. Well, don't be weird like me and form prejudices off of a bad sample size and poor representation.  I came in with a friend and I tried a Pumpkin Spice Latte with almond milk. SO MUCH YUM. SO MUCH. The thing was also pretty potent, caffeine-wise, but not too sweet. It was perfect. 

The atmosphere seemed nice. We sat outside and enjoyed the sunshine, but there were plenty of seats inside. 

I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee chill spot reminds me of Starbucks . I had the turtle mocha and it was delicious"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The employees are awesome and the coffee is so good.  I love the blueberry muffin too.  All of them are so nice and there are plenty of places to sit and chill.  It is easy access if on foot or bike so that's a plus too."}
{"text":"Grabbed a cup of caffeine on New Years Day afternoon to run a few errands - for the places that were open.  Unfortunately, there were a lot of places open so I had to run around quite a bit.  

The store is funky and divided with another place across the way.  I don't like Caribou as much as I like Starbucks.  Reminder to self - their holiday drinks are too sweet.  

dmo out."}
{"text":"It's ok. I grabbed a coffee and left. It seemed smaller than most Caribous. My drink was fine. It is what it is."}
{"text":"Large northern light dark chocolate mocha with an extra shot and the non-fat whipped cream (life's too short to skip the whip). It's my go to and I love the atmosphere and staff behind the bar. I also have it on good authority that their kid's hot chocolate is so good. There's something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever seen. The clerk almost wispers and was struggling to even enumerate the flavors available for their bubble tea. Total lack luster and lethargic performance. If she was sick, she should have just stayed home.  A good disposition should be their first lesson in customer service!"}
{"text":"They have decent chai here. The hot chocolate is really good though. I ordered that at a different location. They offer a choice of milk chocolate, white chocolate or dark chocolate chips in your drink! I got the dark chocolate one and I thought it was quite tasty. The coffee seems pretty strong here and the prices are about what you'd pay at most chains. It's a pretty typical coffee shop."}
{"text":"Collocated conveniently to Bruegger's bagels and Subway. Rewards program is great"}
{"text":"Aside from the staff being very attractive, the coffee is like a soft blanket for the taste buds.  This is one of the few places you can enjoy two businesses being in one space that compliment each other well!  Brueggers is about 5 steps to the left of the best coffee Caribou has to offer (which I'm sure Brueggers suffers with selling their own coffee).  

If you want the best experience in breakfast food, service, free wireless, clean area and nice part of town with the best eye candy options available, then THIS is the place for you!!  

Breakfast of Champions!"}
{"text":"So I have been a Caribou fan for years, and love that this location is still around. The service is always great and the location is very warm, with several tables to work, gather with friends and relax. 
In addition, this location is shared jointly with Bruegger's Bagels, a definite plus.
Caribou has great breakfast/snack items, but having the bagel option right next to you is great, since Caribou doesn't serve bagels. One thing that I has always disappointed me.

Next time your in Park Road Shopping Center stop by and enjoy a morning coffee or afternoon pick me up!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible they have the longest wait . They took up half of my work break to give me hot chocolate then the cashier forgot my lemon bread then told me to hold it while she give me a plate. Like the lemon bread was a rock or sheet of paper. Unprofessional!!"}
{"text":"Turtle Mocha.... enough said! 

I have been in love with their hot cocoa and turtle mochas since I can remember. My early mornings of rushing out of the house, stumping toes and all, just to get across town before the morning rush hour... is worth every sip! Lol"}
