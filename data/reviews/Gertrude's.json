{"text":"Like many other reviewers , I LOVE the Botanical Garden.  So Gertrude's has seemed like a nice and convenient place to go.  The first time we went (2 years ago) the food was great!  I've been back twice, and not been super impressed.  Most recently, I ordered some sweet potato soup, which sounded great on a December night outside, but it was spicy, and too spicy!  So much so, that I stopped eating 1/2 way through.  Unfortunate because it tasted really good otherwise.  My husband had the duck enchiladas, and said that while the mole sauce was good, it overpowered the taste of the duck.  Seems like the kitchen is a little too heavy handed with the seasonings, which then overpower the primary ingredients, rather than enhance them.  And given that it's pretty spendy, I would expect a higher quality (and quantity also!) from the meals."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Gertrude's with a party of four.  We waited 20 minutes from the time we ordered our drinks ( not too complicated - 4 margaritas) until the drinks arrived. At that time our server took our food orders.  25 minutes later he came over and told us that due to a computer glitch, our food order did not get entered, but he would process it promptly. 

Another 25 minutes later, we were served.  

We were bored and very hungry by this time.  The server announced that the food order would be discounted 50% because of the wait.  Two of the party were several bites into their hamburgers before they realized they'd been served each other's sandwiches and exchanged dishes.  The server came by when we were about half through eating, and asked how things were.  I said fine, but for a strip of bacon in my sandwich that was raw (truly, it was raw).

The server left and had a very visible conference with a woman whom we took to be the manager, during which time they kept looking over at us.  A few minutes later, the woman came over and shoved a plate of crisp bacon onto the table at my left elbow.  She did not introduce herself, but said apparently there was some complaint about the bacon and pointed out that the bacon was served the way most customers want it. Her manner was blunt and rude, without a word of apology for the long wait.  

At that point two of our party checked their sandwiches and found their bacon to be cooked, and found it curious, if the prevailing preference is undercooked (raw).

I would forgive all and try this place again one day, but for the rudeness of the woman, who was not in any sort of uniform, but appeared to be in charge."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this little desert oasis. The server Carlos was professional and attentive. The food was delicious. I had the mussels and gardenrita. Tasty food, excellent service, and a nice atmosphere! I will be returning to explore more of this menu :)"}
{"text":"Love, love, love everything except the hostess staff - they are rude.  Food is great, beautiful location, superb decor - even the plates and cutlery are pretty.  Everything I have had here is terrific.  Great soups and coffee.  My three year old loves the macaroni and cheese and desert donuts - go figure.  Can't decide if I want to laugh or cry about all the comments from people who can't find it - really- it's right smack at the entrance to the Desert Botanical Garden - how could you miss it?  There is only one entrance and you can see the umbrellas, lights, people eating and hear all the noise that comes from an open air restaurant.  Really stunned that the location is an issue for anyone."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place five stars - I've seen plenty restaurants that tried to awkwardly work themselves into destinations (art galleries, historical sites, etc...) but my initial impression is that Gertrude's has created its own comfortable niche in the botanical gardens. 

Had the Bacon+Almond+Date = Tasty and Bleu Niman Burger for lunch - good stuff.

Eating out on the patio, nestled amongst Sonoran vegetation, definitely made this a  local consume.  

If Gertrude's stays focused on quality, uniqueness and its context with the desert gardens, it will probably become one of the Valley's most identifiable restaurants - keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I loved my visit to this place!  I recommend it to all of my friends and family. I was recently there and they have changed their quinoa salad to a very refreshing quinoa salad topped with spinach.  

I must say that the staff here were delightful and full of smiles. The manager even visits your table to make sure your food was prepared to your liking. I am always impressed when I visit Gertrude's and I look forward to returning again soon to see what other menu options they come up with."}
{"text":"We ate here after a visit to the Botanical Gardens. We weren't sure if we were going to be seated because there were several reservations however apparently some did not show up so we were seated within about 10 minutes.  The bar was available for seating immediately.

We liked the atmosphere and the menu options. We both got a prickly pear ginger fizz non alcoholic drink which was good. 

We tried the calamari appetizer and enjoyed it. We have had calamari a few different ways and this was a new one but it was good.  My husband ordered the mahi mahi fish tacos and while he enjoyed them he felt there could have been more flavor to the whole dish overall.  I ordered the burger with blue cheese and an onion sauce. I don't usually order burgers but this sounded so good that I had to try it and I was not disappointed. It was a wonderful and delicious combination of tastes for a burger.  

Overall we enjoyed our meal, we got good service and had a nice place to eat."}
{"text":"Went to Gertrude's last night and had one of the worst meals of my life.  Gertrude's salad came with a dressing of yogurt watered down with lemon juice...no seasonings...absolutely tasteless.  My girlfriend and I order the steak.  I have never had such a tough and chewy piece  of meat in my life.  It was extremely difficult to cut and took for ever to chew.  One word...RUBBER.  When we mentioned it to the waiter he said \"Oh, really?  For an entree over $30 it should have been a better cut of meat.  I suggest that the chef go to Zinc Bistro and learn how to make the dish from someone who knows how. How can this be a 4 star restaurant???? Will not return"}
{"text":"The ice cream and the sorbet here are phenomenal it is also home made and very tasty."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Went with a group. Terrible service, long wait for meal, food wasn't anything special, server forgot to bring food they were boxing and passive agressive waitress making comments about seperate checks while collecting an overly generous tip for group gratuity.  2 hours I won't get back.  One star rating  is generous."}
{"text":"Great restaurant that is actually in the Botanical Garden. Serving unique, local dishes as well as  more traditional dishes. Small menu, well put together, excellent cocktails. I would recommend smoked tofu, Anasazi bean hummus, the burger is always great. The grapefruit spin on tequilla sunrise is a definite must. Also featuring a nice list of unique non-alcoholic drinks and good wine list."}
{"text":"My wife and l had a wonderful dinner on the patio. The surrounding plants were beautiful.
The service was exceptional. We started with cocktails which were very good and set the
positive mood for the meal. We shared a muscle and a beet salad which were very tasty.
Our main dish was large and succulent scallops. The chef cooks food with sauces that have a Cajun quality and accent the dishes. For desert we shared a flowerless chocolate cake complemented with bittersweet chocolate and whip cream with toasted nuts.  The wait staff
gave us recommendations and described the dishes perfectly. We will definitely return and bring friends with us. This restaurant was a great surprise for us when we only went to see The Phoenix Dessert Gardens and were looking for a place to rest our weary feet."}
{"text":"Fabulous place! I wasn't expecting too much from a restaurant joined to a tourist destination, but the food was amazing. I ordered the warm roasted cauliflower, kale and eggplant grilled salad accompanied with grilled salmon. The salmon was perfectly cooked and the vegetables had a perfect olive oil / salted taste.  Gertrude's is the reason to go to the desert botanical gardens!"}
{"text":"First time in Phoenix and found this little gem just by visiting hole in the rock. I reserved a table in seconds and when I got there was sat immediately. While people who showed up had to wait 45 min for a table. We were recommended to get the hummus and Gertrude's burger. I was impressed by both. Staff was very friendly and was a very nice restaurant. I will be coming back on my next visit to phoenix."}
{"text":"Not a great experience and expensive for what you get. Felt rushed by the server."}
{"text":"Gertrude's has a lot of potential, but it just misses the mark for me. It's located in the botanical garden, but you certainly don't need a membership to eat there. It has seating inside, a bar and patio seating. It was incredibly busy when we arrived, so we chose to sit at the bar.

I ordered the Niman Ranch Burger with a Big Blue Van Beer. The niman burger, while it was still good, didn't live up to the ingredients. I didn't taste any of the house 1000 dressing and smoked cheddar was nonexistent. But the burger was still a good burger. Meat and the sesame bun were great, it just needed toppings that had flavor.

If you're curious what a blueberry beer taste like, then give big blue van a shot. It is sweet, but not overly sweet and quite refreshing for a hot Phoenix day. 

Service was great. The bartender taking our order was really friendly, offered us recommendations, and we chatted about big blue van beer.

Like I said, Gertrude has some real potential."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Difficulty parking because of closures on their property. They called to see if we were still going to come at 7:02 for a 7 pm appt (we were walking from the lot.)

Front desk person was nice. Server (who appeared to also be the manager) was very brusque and even rude. We ordered an appetizer and he came back to say he 'couldn't sell' that 'tonight.'

After a long absence it became obvious he wasn't interested in  taking our order, and  he didn't wish to serve anyone else. We had ordered iced tea; hadn't drank it (seemed unfresh.) We offered to pay for it and go. He presented a bill for it. Acted like 'good riddance.' 
They were supposed to  be open until 9:30; as we left we heard the woman in front tell someone walking in that they were closing
1) there should have been an apology!
2) they should not have charged us for the tea
3) this was our anniversary dinner!! NEVER again
We have been garden members since 2009 when we moved here. We won't be rejoining!!"}
{"text":"Went to Gertrude's, again, to try the new Gertrude's Burger!!!! ... As expected, DELICIOUS!!! I definately recommend having this burger...oh my! Never dissapointed in the service...very attentive staff, and ofcourse the atmosphere is pretty relaxing too!! Will be back to try more of the new menu...wish my tummy was bigger...LOL...I would try it all in one sitting... :)"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to enjoy a fabulous meal and experience the beauty of the Desert Botanical Garden--a Phoenix treasure, in my opinion. The menu has much variety and offers many dishes prepared with locally sourced fresh products. The cornmeal calamari appetizer is a creative combination of flavorful breaded calamari, red onion, and sweet peppers on a bed of delicious fresh dressed greens. It was seriously top-shelf, generous in size, and so tasty. The beet salad was another highlight with tender fresh beets, tangy maple vinaigrette, goat cheese, hazelnuts, and excellent garden-fresh lettuces. I ordered the large size and ate every savory bite. 

Our server was personable and helpful, as was the manager on duty. Since it was a hot day, we ate inside the dining room this time, but very much look forward to visiting again when it's cool enough to eat outside on the lovely patio. I'm excited to return and try something off the appealing cocktail menu and the dessert menu. It looks like they have some nice happy hour deals also. 

I agree with another reviewer who hopes more diners bypass the local chain restaurants and support fantastic, independent places like Gertrude's where the chefs truly support and source local food providers and businesses in the creation of their dishes."}
{"text":"A fun place to lunch and unwind after a stroll in the gardens. We ordered the Greens salad, and a quinoa veggie wrap. Mac and cheese for the kid. The salad was decent, good selection of greens, and not too heavy on the dressing. The wrap was fresh, and light. The mac and cheese was creamy and excellent. They need to put this on the \"grown'ups\" menu! :-)  All in all, a good fresh food restuarant."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal here! The ambiance is great, and they even got some heaters going for us when it got a bit chilly.

The food was good as well - we had the salmon dish as well as the blue cheese burger. We also had the donuts for desert (yum!). We would probably return, but the prices are a bit expensive for the portion sizes. We were full at the end, but we didn't get to take home any leftovers!"}
{"text":"Awful...returned the meal 3 times...and they still didn't get it right.  Food too salty."}
{"text":"Perfect evening, let me elaborate.  It was a perfect Phoenix fall evening to sit outside and have dinner.   When my wife and I arrived, we were greeted with a smile and taken to our table.  The server promptly came to the table took our wine order & talked to us about the new menu as well as told us some of his favorites; which we took his advice and ordered the Lollipop Kale (It was delicious!!!).   I love the wine list it has a little bit for everyone, I had a local producer Chateau Tumbleweed for my glass of white wine, I was pleasantly surprised on how good it was (I am not a huge AZ wine fan yet).  On recommendations from our server I ordered the braised pork cheek & my wife the scallops. Both dishes came out promptly after our appetizers were finished and cleared. The flavor and tenderness of the braised pork cheek was incredible it was my wife loved her scallops, which just from looking at you could tell the chef knew what they were doing perfectly seared and not overcooked in the center!!  For the dinner wines, my wife ordered a lovely Oregon Pinot Noir from Left Coast Cellars (she said it paired perfectly) & I had an amazing Washington Cabernet Sauvignon from Powers Winery!!  We finished the dinner with the doughnut holes which are amazing, three sauces all of which tasted great with the doughnut holes.  The service for the entire evening was outstanding.  I can say that as I for years in fine dining, they were well dressed, attentive, knew the menus inside and out and had wonderful recommendations.  Overall a perfect fall evening in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"OMG!  This \"used\" to be one of our favorite places for brunch.  The Eggs Benedict was out of this world..scrumptious ham, perfect eggs on English muffin with Hollandaise sauce.  We went today, and I didn't even look at the menu (my big mistake) and ordered it.  What was put in front of me was shocking.  Some fried up chorizo sausage, dumped on something that resembled a tortilla, but it wasn't, 2 quail sized eggs.. and one was hard cooked.  GAG!!!  I ate the eggs and the fingerling potatoes....$15.00  The waiter did ask me if I wanted something else, but I no longer had an appetite. Why in the world they would have changed that is beyond me.  THIS WAS GROSS!"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I recently dined here mid-week during the lunch hour.

The overall ambiance of the restaurant (mind you it's too hot to sit outside) was not that impressive.  The inside dining area seemed sterile and only featured a simple succulent plant on each table...nothing ellaborate or inviting.
I imagine that sitting outside in the cooler months makes the ambiance...so don't waste your time going when it's hot, as you may think you are sitting in a cafeteria. 

Unfortunately I was expecting to be impressed with the food as well, especially after reading some reviews.  However, the food fell short of any high expectation I had.  
I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with the triple cooked fries.
Unfortunately, the sandwich itself was incredibly greasy and the fries were almost a chewy consistency.  
Others in our party ordered the Niman Ranch Burger (complaint of grease and chewy fries), Steak and Fries (steak was overcooked), Salmon salad (no complaints), Green Chili Pork (o.k.).

I have since been online to the County site and read the not so flattering inspection reports.  It seems they have a few things to work on.

No need for me to go back to Gertrude's...I'm glad I tried it, but once was enough."}
{"text":"The first time we came here was for my husbands birthday brunch about a year ago and the food and service were superb! Lisa was our waitress on that occasion and our favorites were the smoked salmon platter and the special dessert which consists on homemade donuts and chocolate sauce. Our last visit we were celebrating my mother in laws 80th birthday and Jeremiah took every step to ensure she had the most amazing experience. So much so that she wrote us a letter saying that it was the best birthday she has ever had and she wants to go back for her 90th!! They sure know how to make someone feel special! We went during restaurant week also and they were busy! The food was amazing as well, I especially liked the prickly pear jalapeno infused margarita! The Botanical Garden is such a peaceful spot too, the gift shop just can't be missed it is full of one of the kind items and very charming gifts!! Def. will be back!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Gertrude's several times and always enjoyed the experience. However, tonight was a completely diffferent event.  I raved about it to my family and insisted we go while attending Luminarious.  What a mistake, 

I had cold brisket, my nephew ate less than half of his braised pork shank and when I asked about it, his description was tough, cold and poorly prepared. His wife has had an upset stomach since we got home.  She had the black pepper spaghetti because she loves peppers, and it was also cold.

Unfortunately, the best meals were my great niece's hamburger and my great nephew's mac and cheese. We could have gone to a high end burger place and spent far less than $200.00 

There are too many wonderful restaurants between DBG and my house, so that was my last Gertrude's visit.  

Oh, and by the way, I nicely told the manager about our cold food and he did not even offer to comp a dessert.  He did offer to send it back, but it was getting late and we all opted out."}
{"text":"We ate lunch.  The food was very good but the portions were a little small. The wait staff was very attentive.  The atmosphere is very lovely especially on the patio.  This would be a good place for a special occasion.  The food is a little over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"We went here a couple of months ago...Mother's day dinner.  I called ahead to find out if they can accommodate my son's many food allergies (already assuming that they probably can't).  I spoke to the manager (I believe her name was Barbara or Linda- I wish I can remember!) and she was very nice and gave me options of what they can prepare for my son.  I told her she just made my Mother's day!  We were not disappointed!...the ambiance was perfect! We all loved sitting out and seeing the cacti, birds, flowers, etc. And my son enjoyed his allergy free dinner!  Thank you and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had sunset dinner on a Sunday evening in early April. 

Pros - Ability to make a reservation is a plus. Great ambiance - amazing views, awesome outside patio. Scallops were phenomenal. 

Cons - Limited menu choices. Service - might have been the worst waiter I've had in years. Unfriendly, inattentive, unhelpful, and slow. Certainly not what you'd expect from a restaurant priced at $35+ per person. (Fortunately another waiter recognized our displeasure and chipped in.) 

Final comments - Would give Gertrude's another shot for brunch simply due to the ambience and views (assuming of course I was not assigned the same waiter.)"}
{"text":"Took 8 people there for dinner.  Excellent food, with the kitchen very accommodating for special requests.  Wonderful ambiance with the desert atmosphere.  Service was superior, with Scott explaining in detail all of our questions.  The restaurant was quiet enough so everyone could hear each other.  Great change from noisy restaurants!
You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. So bad I can't even describe it. Service completely failed. 
Waited for Table (almost 30 mins even with a reservation). Waited for drinks, waited for food, I talked to the manager, he kindly comped my glass of wine."}
{"text":"We did not have reservations, but the hostess was quite friendly and reserved a table for us just over 30 minutes of wait time.  We returned in 20 minutes and were seated almost immediately.  We did wait a bit for our server to appear, when he did not, I flagged down a random waitress and asked her if she could get us our server.  She actually said, \"Why don't I just get you some water and take your drink orders too...unless you'd like to order as well.\"  How NICE!  Most places the waitress would simply say that they would try to find someone and drift away.  This friendly, smiling person took our entire order even though we were not in her section.  She returned quickly with our drinks and our waiter as well.  What incredible customer service.  It made our day!

The meal and the service were perfect from that point on.  We had the Gorgonzola burger and the chicken sandwich with an ice cold local brew.  Kudos to the management and to that nice waitress (I wish I had her name), but she was short with dark hair put up in a bun.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times in combination with taking in the luminaries.  Had reservation for 7:00 on Dec 26, 2016.  They were \"out of\" Gertie Burgers... whatever those chip things are called... they were so salty, they were completely inedible... and I'm typically not even salt sensitive.  We were very, very disappointed with the menu, service, and quality of food we ended up with.  Will never go to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night prior to the Lights exhibit. Started with several appetizers including mussels (very fresh and highly recommended) \"dirty chips\" with chicken livers, and a cheese and meat plate. I had the duck with steel oats. Very tasty but perhaps a tad over cooked IMO. My friend had the risotto and said while good was not really filling. We had a round of desserts and coffee afterwards. The Red Wine and Chocolate Torte is a MUST! The red wine sauce totally compliments the chocolate. Simply delicious. The staff brought out the Donut Holes and Smoked Chocolate with a nice display for my friend's birthday. Very charming but smoked chocolate? Very strange taste. Wouldn't recommend it unless you are feeling adventurous. Great setting and courteous staff. Most write ups I have seen list it as $-$$ but really it's closer to $$$ if you ask me. A nice treat and evening out nonetheless."}
{"text":"Was disappointed with dinner at Gertrude's today. I had blackened scallops...the accompanying sauces were a rather boring mush except for some celery that added interest (they had been touted as spicy hot). 

When we were selecting our meals, the server had also offered to have the scallops prepared  seared and in a \"mild\" fashion a risotto rather than in the Cajun fashion. A companion had been interested in this and asked if drawn butter could be given as well. The server said no to the drawn butter, so my companion selected a burger. In retrospect, I now wish I had selected the soup and salad, the burger (but with fries), or the mildly prepared scallops.

Another companion had monk fish that had some East Indian flavoring, which was delightful. But then I took another bite and had raw monk fish. I thought to myself, this doesn't taste cooked...it's more like sushi/sashimi, which I love, but somehow, this taste doesn't make me want to eat any more of what I had thought was a wonderful dish (just lost my appetite for it with that raw bite). My companion later asked me if I wanted any more, and I said no. I later noticed she wasn't finishing her last bites, and I asked if she had noticed raw areas, and she affirmed it.

I tasted the burger and thought it was good. Accompanying \"kettle-style\" chips were quite black peppery...just okay. I don't think fries were an option. I have seen this burger served with fries in the past...Anyway... Companion was put off by an area of the burger that was medium-rare/rare in the middle (she'd ordered it medium well). I didn't mind that on a burger. 

I told the server at the end of the meal about the fish so she could tell the chef. She said I should have told her and she would have had it cooked further or something. Her manner seemed overly defensive. I got the impression she thought I was angling for money off the bill. I wasn't. (We had already received it.) I just wanted her to be able to give feedback to the chef. 

I don't know that I will be back to Gertrude's...I think they should be able to cook the fish better. I also just now got grossed out as I realized one reason to cook fish through is possible parasites...Just read monk fish can have round worms. Yuck. Now thinking that I should have spit the raw stuff out. Oh well. I think the Victorians used to swallow tape worms as a dieting measure. Link below says folks can often feel worms in mouth. I don't think I want anymore monk fish. Nope.

http://www.yourdoctorsorders.com/2014/05/parasites-and-seafood/ --reason fish should be cooked thoroughly. 

Outdoor table at Gertrude's quite nice. Bread and butter was wonderful... Nicely herbed and toasted.

If I were to return here, I might try soup and salad...dessert....or drinks...after or before going into the garden. I think Gertrude's needs to work on their entree execution. One major thing they have going for them is their location....I would not go here just for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting, inventive and delicious food, lovely staff - what more could you ask for? We considered ourselves very lucky to have been directed here during our brief stay in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Had lunch there yesterday, our first visit.  Everything about it was spectacular, ambience, food and service.  Great selection of vegetarian dishes.  Everything was carefully prepared and artfully presented; it's rare that the dish itself exceeds the menu descriptions.  We had the bread service (wonderfully crusty, they said the name of the bakery but can't remember).  \"Sweet tea butter with black Hawaiian sea sale.\"  Sounds pedestrian, tasted wonderful.  The dish called \"Grilled Baby Carrots\" is listed under salads, but is not like any salad ever.  Again, the menu just says \"cumin-scented yoghurt + chemoula + fried AZ chickpeas\" which doesn't even come close to describing the explosive flavors.  For dessert we shared \"Donuts + Sauces.\"  Order it.  Trust me.  The host station folks were welcoming and charming, our server Matthew was terrific and so engaging, and even GM Michelle Jacob stopped by (a couple of times!) to see how we were doing.  Wonderfully creative craft cocktail menu.  I know this must sound like I own shares in the place, the truth is we're not even from Phoenix and just drove out to DBS to get into the countryside.  Didn't know anything about the restaurant, didn't plan to eat there.  We saw hummingbirds, lizards, and other critters.  We will definitely be back and recommend it to all our friends.  Note to chefs in our destination-restaurant hometown of Seattle:  Not everything has to contain bacon or offal."}
{"text":"We wandered into the place from the shop by accident but the restaurant did not disappoint! Very freshly made hummus and arugula salad. Recommend the berries lemonade and cactus water. Our servers were very nice too!"}
{"text":"We called multiple times to make a reservation and they never answered the phone. When we finally called the Botanical garden offices they said they never answer. When we got here they told us they couldn't seat us for four hours and we should have called for a reservation."}
{"text":"Third try here. The first time was very good when they opened. Adventurous food menu and adequate wine menu. Next two visits over last 18 months and menu has been extremely pedestrian, dumbed down both food and wine. So disappointed; this is a beautiful spot and I would love to enjoy a delicious experience here. Kitchen is there, maybe something better is in the future."}
{"text":"Second visit to Gertrude's. Not sure if the fact we were seated inside this time and it was very busy contributed to our experience but I'm pretty sure we will not be back. We started with the buratta on burnt ciabatta - not good. When asked how it was we politely said it was burnt making it bitter and not pleasant.  His reaction was hum, sorry and left - he was busy with a 7 top. Entrees, burger and a wrap with chips, way over priced and just mediocre.  If you just want a glass of wine this is probably a nice stop while at the Desert Botanical Gardens if you can get a seat outside."}
{"text":"Lovely setting at the botanic garden, friendly staff but be very careful when ordering.  Don't assume anything about the dishes, your previous experience with something with a similar name and ask about seasonings, ingredients.  I shared a cheese plate with a friend and then had stuffed pasta shells.  I experienced an overload of vinegar between the two dishes, the stuffing in the pasta shells was bland, unseasoned.  The pea puree covering added color but there was little flavor and the dish was exceedingly disappointing.  I'd go back to the garden but not the restaurant."}
{"text":"Hello - we visited a couple weeks ago - place is new this past month - loved eating out in the sunshine on the patio away from traffic.  Being at Desert Botanical Gardens makes it reallly special - nice decor - friendly people and good service.
Menu - I had a salmon salad that was very good except for clumps of potato with skins that did not fit.  I would have liked another vegetable or egg.  The potato took away from my salad.

Hubby had the veggie sandwich and seemed to like it and ate it all - but his fries were no good - should be sweet potato to go with the whole idea of the place - fresh and organic atmosphere seems to be it for Desert Botanical - not just fries you can get any place - or option for a side salad - I never order fries so I would not get that sandwich.

We will go back - love the Gardens and the idea of the Gertrude's up front and open to the public but do feel they really need to be on top of the menu items to keep the locals coming - I have been in the Valley 37 years - we eat out a lot and there are a lot of places to eat that compete with this one.  They have location and decor and patio going for them, now knock me out with the menu.

Good luck to them - the concept and location are fab - we will be back and thank you for doing this in south Scottsdale's development area.  We live in Old town and love to eat in our area.

{"text":"We went to the gardens to enjoy the Sonoran light exhibits. Getting a table at Gertrude's proved to be tricky due to it being so busy. Max, who took our reservation by phone offered great suggestions for timing and parking. As luck would have it, he turned out to be our waiter upon our arrival. Getrude's is a foodie paradise. Thanks to a fantastic tour of the menu from our waiter, I had an amazing barrel aged Manhattan crafted on site along with steamed mussel appetizer and blackened scallops sent from heaven. Everyone seemed to be having a great time around us and my guests were very impressed with the experience. I had never been before, but definitely plan on being back. The place is crazy busy so I'm not sure why others on here seem to writing negative things. We love Getrude's, the Garden, and Max."}
{"text":"We went hear Friday evening. I always pick the restaurant for our group of friends and this is the first time in over a year everyone was VERY disappointed. 

The two appetizers the waiter recommended were bland and highly salted. The hummus tasted like mushed up nothingness and tons of salt added. It had no flavor . Second was the cauliflower. We make this at home weekly and I can make better at home. Once again had no seasoning or flavor.  

We both ordered the burgers for dinner and once again NO FLAVOR. I don't understand how you can screw up a burger and potatoes(they don't have fries). Overall I was very disappointed and embarrassed as I recommended the restaurant. We all left unsatisfied and upset we wasted our money."}
{"text":"We loved our evening in the Desert Botanical Garden! Beautiful place, even better with the Light Show that evening. We made a reservation at Gertrude's for 7:45, the earliest we could get for such a busy evening. We were seated on time, outside as we requested. Our waitress was very good and pleasant. The setting was just lovely. Unfortunately, they had run out of bread, and we were very hungry by 8:00 PM. When our entrees arrived, we were disappointed with the portions. For $34, I had 3 scallops served on a corn-tomato relish. That was it. My husband had the duck dish, and he had a little more on his plate than I did. He had ordered the potato soup as an appetizer, and it was delicious. We each had a glass of wine. With the tip, we spent over $100. The scallops were not hot, and I hoped they were cooked enough. Someone at the next table sent her dish back because it wasn't hot. 
So........I would have to hesitate before recommending Gertrude's. Perhaps lunch or brunch would be a better choice."}
{"text":"I had flat iron steak and eggs on the advice of our server. It was amazing. It also included fingerling potatoes. Very very good! I took half home for dinner and it was great again. There was a solo guitarist/singer for background ambiance."}
{"text":"Elegant and relaxing spot with a conceptually great menu that does not deliver on execution and flavor. 

My french toast was dryyy as a bug fart. The bread was not a moist enough variety to begin with and was far too dense, it seemed to have soaked up very little liquid prior to being grilled. The lack of sauce was just silly, it's served with prickly pear syrup and creme fraiche that was one skimpy line each, the ratio to the amount of bread made no sense to me. I can understand if the chef doesn't want the plate drenched in sauces, but there was no balance there at all, and that dry, dense bread actually needed the drenching. At the very least, more syrup needs to be offered as an option when the food was delivered, and the bread should be switched to something fluffier that can get that buttery-sear-with-squishy-innards that french toast has to have to be good.

Our server Max was very very nice, but the service was irritatingly slow regardless, and not just from him, I could see another table trying to flag their server too. We were there before the Sunday rush and I get the feeling that the servers had too much side work and couldn't keep their focus on the tables? Just a guess there, but in any case it took way too long to get a check, and way too long for it to be run. I appreciate that the place is designed for loitering and that it's hard to find that balance between hovering and absenteeism, but they really need to work on it in my opinion.

I'll be back to give the lunch a shot, or to just grab a drink and read a while when time is not at all on my mind, but I really wouldn't recommend Gertrude's to anyone at this point, better to go The Farm or somewhere in Old Town and then mosey over to the Botanical Garden after. But I know they're really trying to make Gertrude's a great place and I'll be rooting for them. I'm guessing they face some specific challenges due to the location and hope they can find their groove."}
{"text":"Disappointing! Went for brunch for mother's day. Last year it was great. Today, both the food and service were mediocre at best. Even though it was not very busy and there were lots of empty tables, they \"ran out \" of glasses and we got water in plastic cups. Every time we needed refills we had to ask. We had to waive staff down anytime we needed something. The food came out quickly but cold. It seemed they had made a bunch and then weren't as busy as expected so it just sat until someone ordered it. Everything needed seasoning too. All around disappointment for an over priced mother's day brunch."}
{"text":"Not only did my coworkers and I receive amazing service, but the food and drink was phenomenal. Hands down the best experience I've had thus far during my trip. The team is helpful and knowledgable! Try everything - especially the burrata appetizer and if you can get Michelle to make you a gin and tonic (amazing)!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff, amazing desserts, and amazing Korean fried chicken. An innovative little gem in the desert gardens."}
{"text":"Im visiting from SC and had to visit the botanicals garden, and lo and behold came across Gertrudes, what a superb place!  Sat at the bar, and was completely taken care of.  Lunch and drinks, outstanding!  Love it"}
{"text":"We dined at Gertrude's after a full day of watching a baseball game and exploring the botanical gardens in which Gertrude's is located.  Brand, spanking new, it was a delightful experience, far exceeding our expectations.  We dined al fresco, on the first warm evening in a while. The tree lights and the Chihuly sculptures enhanced the experience.
OK... the food, exceptional.  Fresh ingredients (no freezer, no microwave). Wonderful bison carpaccio, whole grain salad, risotto and lambcetta that melted in your mouth.  The bar specializes in gin and there were some signature gin drinks that were creative and tasty.  The bar was a bit slow, but we didn't mind the wait.
The servers were knowledgeable, attentive and respected some of our dietary restrictions and went out of their way to make sure the food was safe for my wife.  
At the end, the executive chef and the owner paid us a visit and listened carefully to our comments on the experience.  I predict a great future for this dining room.  The chef has a lot of tasty ideas up his sleeve.  Go out of your way and pay them a visit.  
Oops, I neglected the deserts, a decadent chocolate cake and semifreddo, and a yummy brown butter apple tart."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this restaurant because of the surroundings and my general love of the Garden. Unfortunately, the food is overpriced and not always delicious. Perhaps I am too low-brow, but I did not enjoy anything I have tried here with the notable exception of the banana bread French toast- that particular dish is amazing.

As a vegetarian, I cannot speak to the meat dishes, but the hummus was mediocre (very dry and serviced with pickled veggies), the chocolate dessert unsatisfying, and the egg dishes a bit flavorless.  Also, the portions are small for the price.

I suggest having a drink here on a quiet weekday evening, and maybe some banana bread French toast on a Sunday morning.  Other than that, I would not recommend."}
{"text":"The new summer menu is fabulous! I had the chicken club and it was delicious. Can't wait to get back to Gertrude's to try more of the new menu!"}
{"text":"Servers are pretty condescending and the atmosphere is what you would expect for a restaurant in a tourist attraction. Most of the plates come with potato chips which are like lays but with sea salt and pepper. My plate had a hair on it, which sucks but I guess it happens every once in a while? The best thing was the cactus lemonade. Still though, not worth it."}
{"text":"Such an amazing and beautiful place with astonishing art all around.... The food was a bliss and very delicious to the T. 
Our server was very knowledgeable if the area and very like able..."}
{"text":"Food was fine - wings and cakes pretty interesting but the service is lacking. Also for kids they ran out of burgers and chicken fingers."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. We tried the Whole Grain salad - fresh and flavorful. Loved the lemon-chile vinaigrette. Chef Stephen even came by our table to answer questions about the dish.  Also the tables outside provide a very pleasant dining environment to enjoy Chef Stephen's yummy creations before you tour the Desert Botanical Garden."}
{"text":"We thought it was excellent! My friend and I were pleasantly surprised. Their menu changes in a few day so I won't go on about what we had, but it was all delicious! We were also surprised to see such a nice bar, with local beer, a large wine list, and excellent cocktails. We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Tasty, healthy, great location, creative menu & great service.

Not your typical \"museum \" restaurant."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place is great and the service is too notch. I recommend coming here during restaurant week. The doughnut dessert here is Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious cocktails and US sourced cheese and meats on the charcuterie plate. The maître'd is very proud of the accolades heaped upon the restaurant, and with good reason. Locally sourced ingredients in the cocktails make them uniquely Arizonian. Our waiter, Joshua, was the picture of perfect service; attentive without being overbearing nor obsequious. If you're not going to the Dessert Botanical Gardens, you should. And since you're there, you should definitely stop at Gertrude's."}
{"text":"We had breakfast on the beautiful patio after doing the Lymphoma walk at the zoo. The Garden Frittata was a very nice presentation but it was the worst frittata I have ever had.  No vegetables, no flavor!!! Two of us had it and we both thought the same thing.  Service was slow for how few tables were occupied.  Fortunately the ambiance was lovely, but doubt I will go again."}
{"text":"Outstanding service.  Friendly staff.  We ordered the four suggestions of our waitperson and each was superb!!!  Terrific time!"}
{"text":"Lovely place, fairly good service, but the food for all six of us was NOT good. Four ordered fish tacos made with mahi mahi and two ordered burgers. They substituted shrimp for the fish without asking. The tacos were bland and though attractively presented were not worth eating. The burgers were too dry, even cooked medium, and \"tasted strange\", according to one diner. I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Meh... I'll give Gertrude's three stars. It was a busy, warm day when we went there. The food was pretty good, as well as, cocktails and met our needs for being hungry at a tourist trap, but I'll save my postcard to Mom & Dad.... We had the homemade bread, which while good, didn't seem to taste as fresh to me as \"homemade\" (rather hard inside/out), but maybe they make it a day before.... We split a burger, which was large and flavorful and did come with a generous portion of fries. However, I was unimpressed w/the service and the manager.  The waitress did the minimum, but there wasn't much memorable about her. (I think she was probably over her head w/tables to be honest.)  My hubs waited probably 15 min. for his cocktail, which arrived at the same time as our entree.  I mentioned this to the manager and she apologized and said she'd go check \"right now\" and then proceeded to uproot a table of four Seniors (who had been sitting at their table probably 10 min. still w/out drinks) across the restaurant to make room for a party of eight. They were nicer than I would have been... No offer to comp anything or chance for them really to say no, just this is the deal, so up and Adam, Seniors! Chop! Chop! Then we heard her apologizing to two other tables, as well. Again, no comps or really any offers to make it right, just kind of a big smile w/a sorry to hear this type comment. Which is fine, I guess, but it's also probably not so great when other customers can hear this going on over and over... She did, however, come back to check on my hubs drink 10 min. after I asked... Like I said, a decent meal (food-wise) for an hour stop w/in our day, but I don't think I'd truly, overwhelmingly recommend or eat there again. Food tasting well is one thing, but customer service is certainly just as important too!  Just my $1.25...."}
{"text":"It was my first time to Gertrude's and I was very excited to try the food and experience the botanical garden. When I arrived, we were told they could seat us right away but we had to give up our table in an hour. I've never been to any restaurant where I have been told I had to give up my table. After they sat us, it took them over 10 minutes to offer us drinks and they were not that busy at this point. I am in my 20's and it is clear we were given a different level of service. The food was great but I was so turned off by the service that I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"We were so disappointed with the service and food at this place. Although our server was friendly she was very inattentive. After ordering our food, we waited 40 mins for our breakfast and it never arrived.It wasn't busy at all and there was plenty of staff standing around chatting.We asked someone to check on our order and was given a vague response of it will be out soon. 10 mins later still no food, no refills on our drinks. We decided to cut our losses and leave so flagged down someone we think was the manager and explained we wanted to cancel our food order and why. He didn't seem the least bit concern instead was very curt and rude to us about our request and stormed away. No apology or explanation was given to us for why there was such a long delay from this man. We finally were able to get our waitress's attention and told her to cancel our food and we paid for our drinks and left. The waitress did apology for the long wait l but 40 mins for an egg breakfast is a ridiculous wait time when it's not busy in a restaurant. Although the ambiance is great, I don't recommend eating here. Maybe just drinks would be fine."}
{"text":"There are better. 
We went with a large group on a Saturday night and had reservation. They were 40 minutes late seating us. That happens but for an upscale restaurant they didn't compensate very well; we had to ask for some apps on the house. The service was fine but not remarkable. I had the Ham Steak which was a good portion but way to salty. The baked beans that came with the fried chicken were underdone but the chicken was good. I recommend getting a salad and adding the steak as that was the best meal that others had. The steak was well cooked and tender. 
Overall, it was not worth the price. There are much better places for a nice dinner. It would be a fine place for a drink before the special exhibits but the bar was pretty full from what I saw. So, go to special exhibits, enjoy the botanical garden, leave the underwhelming and expensive dinner to the tourists."}
{"text":"I was looking for a nice relaxing lunch on a Monday after I had worked many straight days in a very busy fine dining resort restaurant.  First time dining here, and sadly, the last. We tried the house salad, the hummus, the golden rice grits, the bread, and the veggie wrap. I had previously thought that Gertrude's was a veggie friendly concept, but no.  The house salad was served wet with water and a flavorless dressing. If you charge $4 for bread, it should at least be served warm.  The butter was also flavorless. The hummus was good, especially the cauliflower because it at least had flavor.  The golden rice grits were below average, again, would using a little salt and pepper kill the chef??? And why balsamic on everything? Made the dish worse, not better. Another annoying detail, no salt and pepper on the table. My boyfriend's veggie wrap was pretty bad, too. Again, didn't taste like anything! 

The service was ok, but it's essential for a busy restaurant to have support staff. There are no bussers and no food runners. So if you need your server, they are probably too busy running someone else's food. With the prices they charge this is unacceptable. 

So if the ambiance is what you're looking for, well, it's beautiful, we had a great table by the fountain, but the peace was constantly interrupted by the manager moving umbrellas with heavy metal bases. So all I could hear was scrape, scrape, scrape the entire lunch. So even with one entree comped because it was barely eaten, and 2 glasses of wine, our unpleasant, barely edible lunch was still over $70. I hate being taken! I work with really talented cooks, and they would never put food out like this. The chef clearly has no palate! Well, they are busy with the captive clientele that visit the gardens. What a disappointment.  All I can say is, tourist trap."}
{"text":"My wife and I both love this restaurant. The food is very good, but nothing at all beats the atmosphere on the patio in the evening. We have taken multiple groups of friends and family to the restaurant, always to rave reviews. The menu changes frequently, and I have loved some of their food more than others, but each time is good. I would definitely recommend the cheese and charcuterie platter. The brick chicken was amazing. I would strongly  recommend this place. The only drawback is that the prices are on the high side."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of the new menu.  The gumbo bowl was extremely salty.  The Gertrude's burger was just okay, it wasn't quite cooked as requested, but it would have been too messy to have it sent back to cook it longer. It easily fell apart with all the moist toppings and had to be eaten like an open faced sandwich.  I am so glad that we did not bring out of town guests this visit. I would have been embarrassed about the food. For what we received, I felt that it was overpriced and such a disappointment.  On a positive note, we were seated right away and were served promptly.  The outdoor atmosphere is also very nice this time of year."}
{"text":"In love with Gertrude's tonight. Such a great place. They have so many unique dishes and drinks to serve. The Cobbler Desert and Salmon Salad was bomb Will be back soon to try even more. I had the Merlin White wine blend and it was crisp and sweet."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere at the Gardens. Probably best for meat items. Could have use some spice or sauce to the veggie wrap and the garden salad was boring. How about  some crunch, nuts, cheese and color like tomato or a carrot?"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been to Gertrude's and this was my experience:

1. The service was GREAT. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive but not too much. :)

2. The food has good flavor, but the price is way too much for what you get. Ex: my husband got a burger and it was huge and came with fries...so plenty of food. I got the pasta special and it was supposed to be chicken bolongnese and there was NO chicken in it. Only little bits, and for $15 I think it would be good to have a few pieces of chicken.  It was a bit too small as well (and I don't eat much).

3. The plates especially for the desserts are super big and the desserts are small so it really looks like you don't get much for $10. It is fine to have a small dessert but it's about the impression of it. 

4. The atmosphere is great as well. Love the menu- great ideas, creativity and potential. It's not France though, so for some menu items maybe give a bit more food (or protein)."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to have breakfast or relax before or after a long walk through the Desert Botanical Garden. With a nice bar plus seating inside and plenty of great outdoor seating situated in the middle of the desert landscape. They should have prickly pear tea or juice that is not just alcoholic for us early birds or for the kids!"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here for breakfast today.  The first time we sat on the patio, but it is a bit warm this time of year for that.  But the patio is great in cooler weather and the location at Desert Botanical Garden is superb.

The emphasis is on locally grown fresh ingredients, and the dishes are quite creative and in our experience excellent.  This morning my wife had the pastry special which was a lemon fig scone.  It was very tasty, light and fluffy texture, no crumbs left on the plate.  I had the egg dish special which was a quiche that had quinoa as an ingredient as well as a bean.  It was also excellent.  This is also one of the few places where you can get prickly pear iced tea, which is another great local taste. 

The prices were moderate, and no more than going to Good Egg for example.  We looked at the dinner menu and will be back for dinner some night as the offerings seem to be unique pairing unusual ingredients."}
{"text":"Stay away. Not affiliated with the gardens. Sexist hostesses, rude servers, noise levels that cancel dinner conversations. Oh, don't forget to take out a second mortgage before you dine here. And don't  bother making a reservation, they give their best tables to walkins who look like they have more money."}
{"text":"The food and service is great! I recommend the gumbo appetizer and the braised pork shank with their creamy grits! the pumpkin pie martini was as good as it sounds as well!"}
{"text":"I ordered the breakfast burrito (with some fancy name) and I thought I would just be getting a regular breakfast burrito. This thing was a delight! It was quite large with melted cheese served on top along with some avocado, guacamole and salsa. It all came together quite nicely. I put the guac right on top and mixed in some salsa with my fork and it all came together perfectly. The salsa has a smokey flavor that does not take away from the rest of it at all."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent.  Very unexpected!  We started with the carrot & potato soup and Gertrude salad.  The soup had a nice spicy flavor.  The salad dressing was delish.  The chicken cassoulet was full of flavor whille the duck breast was amazing.  When you didn't think it couldn't get any better dessert was exceptional.  The Panna cotta was devine.  The donuts were delish as well, with the smoke chocolate, prickly pear, and salted caramel sauces.  If we lived here we would definitely be eating here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"The last year at Gertrude's, the food took a turn for the worst. They changed the menu and the food was awful. We kept trying. Today I noted the menu changed and felt excited because they may have realized how bad their chef was. They did but assured me the food would be the same because all the cooks are the same and they have no chef. Don't know who's in charge but help! Those of us who support the Gardens the amazing quality food and service back."}
{"text":"Amazing setting/outside eating area...but then again its the Desert Botanical Garden, from there it got blah.  I had to take out a loan to get the tacos, but I haven't been to a Dave Ramsey course yet so maybe the tacos are a great value and will be traded as commodities on the open market in the future.  I get the feeling Gertrude's has a steep lease with DBG and needs to charge a little extra.  Cool sunsets.
...8/14/14 EDIT to review:  Ok, I upped the rank to 4-star for two reasons fold.  #1 this is a 1-of-a-kind restaurant and setting (world class in the middle of the city/convenience) and #2 let's just say the owner/manager really does care about making this place all it can be.  I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Three of us stopped in after the Sonoran Light show at DBG 
Tuesday 04/05/16. The restaurant was still busy at 8:00 but the hostess seated us pretty quickly. The service was sloppy, I felt the waiter was disappointed to have another table. He was curt and when pouring water would reach over my plate right in front of my face to fill the glass of person next to me. He had plenty of room to step around the table to serve on the right but just leaned over me instead. He did this several times, once right when I was talking the friend across the table. Really rude and awkward, not to mention he did this when pouring hot beverages as well. Other diners were also complaining of the service including one guy that went to use the restroom and was locked out because it was closing time. I guess you could have kept the hostess at the door a little longer. At 9:00 the staff started sweeping the floor even though there were quite a few diners left and food was still coming out of the kitchen. Nothing like feeling unwanted. The food was good but that is not enough if the staff is rude."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this place and decided to try it but in my opinion it was overpriced and the food was just okay. I had the Caipirinha Morango cocktail and I was very disappointed the drink was watered down and had one strawberry. My friend ordered the same drink and her's was filled with strawberries. I asked the waiter if I could have more he said yes but forgot and did not return. Overall I was not impressed with the food and service for the price and would not return."}
{"text":"I really like the breakfast but even though they are open at 10:30am they don't offer breakfast Monday through Friday just on the weekend. Imagine my disappointment when we sat down and we were handed lunch menus at 10:30am on a Friday. The server seemed used to this reaction and said he understood if we wanted to leave. Who opens at 10:30am for lunch?"}
{"text":"Dont waste your money here. Everything was from freezer to table not farm to table as advertised.  Nothing fresh or made from scratch!  Horrible!!!!"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed, thought I was ordering a salad and got a muddy mix of grains with a background of vinegar... and nothing else. My wife was excited about so many vegan options, but she also was let down, garden salad turned out to be spicy arugula with chilli oil dressing that had heat and no flavor. Here's a hint, salt won't kill you. And lastly the carafe for water is filthy; but to be fair every tables was."}
{"text":"We went on Saturday morning during the 75th anniversary \"free\" for everyone day, even though we are garden members.  We sat at the bar, hoping to eat a light breakfast.  We were seated, given a VERY limited menu, given two generous glasses of water and then no one ever came to take our order.  After sitting there for over TEN MINUTES (the restaurant was not crowded), while staff went back and forth in front of us, my husband and I left.  We've been garden members for years and will not go back.  THUMBS DOWN!  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Located in the botanical garden close to the zoo - this place was a retreat from the traffic of Phoenix.  Arrived at sunset.  Sat on the patio.  Had great conversations.  The food was OK.  We tried the Korean chicken, steak, arugula salad, Gertrude salad, cheese plate, hummus with sour goat's cream, ice cream, and custard.  The ice cream and cheese plate were my favorite dishes.  Five star for atmosphere and services.  If you're looking for a place for date night, this place should be on your list."}
{"text":"The dinner was good.  The drinks were good.  The wait for dessert was unacceptable and the excuses made by the manager were unacceptable. I had to go to the manager and complain about the dessert order when it didn't arrive.  I told him we'd been waiting 20 minutes.  When he delivered the dessert he made it clear to me it was 16 minutes, not 20 minutes since the order was placed. He went on to complain about how busy they were and how everyone wanted dessert at the same time.   I don't need an argumentative and excuse making restaurant manger.  There were no refills on the coffee and to replace a goat cheese something on my chocolate dessert with a tiny scoop of ice cream was $3.00.  For a $130.00 dinner it wasn't even McDonald's level service.  What a disappointment.  We've been there four times before.  I doubt seriously we will ever go back."}
{"text":"Very overrated, slow service, tiny portions. I rarely leave a restaurant hungry but definitely did here. I will not be coming back"}
{"text":"You have to love this patio style restaurant that opens to the masterful Desert Botanical Garden.  Ingredients for my lunch were super fresh.  Service is fast.  It's a very popular place, but you can beat the crowd thing by taking a seat at the bar. It's possible to dine here without paying Garden admission, I noticed. I gobbled a blue cheese burger without pausing even once to wonder if watercress stems were hanging out between bites. Yum!"}
{"text":"Perhaps it was my fault. I didn't follow the waiter's advice when he said that the burgers and fish tacos were the best things on the menu. Instead I ordered the  specials; cold fresh green pea soup and mushroom risotto or was it asparagus risotto? It was not memorable. It's something I make at home pretty often and mine, as untrained as I am, is better. The pea soup was bland and chalky. 
My tablemate said that her fish tacos were the best she ever had.

Since it's summer, I won't even think about going back to Gertrude's for at least six months. And then I'll think again."}
{"text":"The seafood was fresh and delicious. Had the mussel appetizer which was fantastic and the scallop entree. Service was friendly and very helpful.. Really enjoyed!"}
{"text":"I was honestly impressed with the menu. They had a huge variety of foods to choose from and a full bar. The atmosphere was incredibly lovely, which I should have expected since it's within the Desert Botanical Garden! I ended up getting elotes, a salad, and a mariposa drink. The drink was one of a few non alcoholic \"fun\" drinks that they offered."}
{"text":"A most excellent evening! We were greeted and made comfortable on the outdoor patio, where friends joined us. We shared a trio of appetizers: a sampling of local cheeses and marinated vegetables, a warm dish of plump mussels and squid, and a crispy kale salad. The salad was a big hit, along with the mussels. For entrees we enjoyed Korean chicken, rich duck enchiladas, succulent scallops and a bodacious cheeseburger. All paired nicely with the local Arizona wines. We did manage to find room for dessert, none of which disappointed. The service was attentive as we wanted for nothing. As a chef for the last 30 years I don't know what else I could have asked for."}
{"text":"I visited Gertrude's as part of a company business trip to Phoenix. As someone from the Boston area, I was completely awe-struck by the scenery (and warm weather) once I stepped out of the car. Cacti, cacti, and more cacti. I ordered the watermelon green tea and indulged in the many appetizers that were sprawled across our table. The bread was so tasty and the sweet tea butter added a perfect twist. Then, we ordered the AZ Tepary Bean Hummus and the Cheese + Charcuterie. The chips were so light and really complemented the hummus. All of the cheeses simply disappeared off the plate once they were put in front of us. I ordered Gertrude's Burger because the Devilled Egg Mayonnaise caught my attention. The portion of the burger was great. All of the toppings flowed together to create one of the tastiest burgers I've ever eaten, especially with seasoned fresh-cut fries on the side! We were a rather large group and I must say that the service was very quick with refilling our drinks and bringing out the food. This place has the best of both words, I would recommend it to anyone visiting Phoenix that wants a true botanical garden experience."}
{"text":"Food was average. Our hostess was not friendly. The server was extremely rude and would make faces after we ordered something.  Never acknowledged when we would say 'thank you' after she brought over an item. Made us feel like we were inconveniencing her."}
{"text":"I went in for a Sunday brunch at about 11:30 am with a few friends. At the most, we waited about 10 minutes to get a table. Which was awesome because we showed up in the middle of Their rush. As we are getting seated on a beautiful patio, with desert flowers and a fountain in the center of the courtyard. I ordered the Brussels and breakfast. A new twist on the classic toad in the stool (hollowed out slice of bread with an egg cooked inside.) Briosh toast, sauteed in more butter, an egg yolk lightly sauteed on the bottom. Served on top was fresh picked Brussels sprout leaves, sauteed in butter with house made bacon lardons, onion jam and banyuls vinegar was used to deglaze the pan. A crispy strip of bacon stuck out of the bread. So freaking money! You don't expect the sweetness of the onion jam and vinegar to go with egg, but they got it down! The serving staff is very informed about the products they use. I'd go back again, probably for dinner this time. See the garden at night."}
{"text":"Gertrude's is in a lovely location, situated right at the entrance to the Desert Botanical Garden.  My wife and I attended the Luminarias event and figured on a light dinner to kick things off.  The restaurant itself is well laid out, and although loud when full the noise is not overwhelming; some attention has obviously been paid to the acoustics.  It's a pleasant place to eat, but the food was disappointing.

The menu is creative, but none of the entrees were immediately appealing, so we went with appetizers and sides that looked tastier.  My wife had the gumbo and a side of broccoli and cheese, I had the dirty chips (potato chips with a blue cheese fondue and chicken livers) and green salad.  The gumbo was tasty and well-spiced on its own, at least at first, but the decision to serve it over horseradish potato salad rather than a more traditional rice base didn't really work for our tastes, and as she ate it she found it increasingly salty to the point where she couldn't finish it.  The chips were tasty at first, but also over-salted; by the time I was halfway through them I couldn't taste anything but salt.  We don't eat out much, so we considered that perhaps our palates were unused to restaurant-level saltiness, but I cook with a fair amount of salt at home so I don't think that's it.  

On the bar front, the blackberry/mint seltzer was delicious, and the beer selection small but well-chosen.  The cocktails also looked tasty as they came out, but we didn't order any so can't vouch for them.  The service was very polite and the food came out very quickly, although I think the staff was a bit overwhelmed by the Luminarias crowd.  

I think it would be a very nice place to go have a drink or two after a stroll through the Garden, but I wouldn't come back to eat."}
{"text":"The service here really killed our experience. We were a table of two, and the only table the server had. She checked on us shortly after getting out food, but then nothing until she dropped the check. We got a oh, you want refills? On our beverages, which were empty when she checked on us. The entire time she was socializing with another server who only had one table as well. They never saw their server either. Gertrudes was fairly empty when we visited at 11 am on a Saturday. The food was ok. I ordered a BLTE (bacon, lettuce, tomato, egg) and they smothered it with aioli, which killed the sandwich. 

Pull it together."}
{"text":"Dined at Gertrude's last evening and it was fantastic!  We had reservations for 2 @ 7:15 but choose to sit at the bar instead because the table was in a fish bowl.  Fred, the bartender, greeted us promptly.  He recommended the Littleneck Clams for a starter.  They had a vibrant full-flavored ham-hock broth.  My Fiance ordered Korean Fried Chicken thighs, they were very tasty - crispy on the outside and moist, tender chicken.  The sauce with yogurt was a perfect blend of heat and yogurt.  I ordered the Blackened Scallops, some of the best I have tasted - cooked to a perfect medium.  For dessert we had a gluten-free chocolate cake.  We enjoyed the tasty meal and the fantastic service from Fred.  Look forward to going back for brunch!"}
{"text":"Service is excellent! It's located in a beautiful setting and Kent, our waiter, was very professional and helpful, couldn't ask for a better quick stop right by the Botanical Garden"}
{"text":"The service at Gertrude's was excellent and the food was definitely good.  However, don't expect to get a deal.  You are definitely paying more because this restaurant is located within the Desert Botanical Gardens property.  I had a veggie wrap and my father had the reuben, which were both featured on the special menu.  The veggie wrap was good, but I have had better.  My dad felt the same about the reuben."}
{"text":"I like to party hard on Friday nights. But an early Saturday morning breakfast at Gertrude's and shopping at the farmer's market are probably the only reasons I'd choose to stay in. Especially because I can get to start my day with a delicious steak! 

I need to come here more often. 

Also, I realize that I should start having \"breakfast at Gertrude's\" for first dates. Because, you know, dinner and drinks is so cliche. Ha!"}
{"text":"Can't recommend it.  Some friends and myself ate there on 2/22/14.  We had reservations for 6pm and it was SUPER crowded, (because of the Chihuly installation), so I would say make a reservation if you'd like to dine here. They did get us to a table outside quickly, but they were so busy, it was a bit before we met our waiter. He introduced himself, told us he'd be back, and took off (could you at least offer us water?). He came back, took our drink orders, didn't ask if we were ready to order (we were), and took off. He came back took our orders and took off. Here come the drinks, which we nursed for about 50 mins. before caving in and ordering a second round. At this point, we just gave up conversing and started staring at the other patrons.

The food arrived a little after an hour we ordered it.  It was good, but nothing to rave about.  We got the lamb dish and that was tasty, but for entrée, it needed about 25% more on the plate. We had the Cornmeal Calamari appetizer, also pretty tasty. I had the Niman Ranch Burger. My impression was it was cooked well (medium rare), but I've had a better burger at the People Pizza Pub downtown. The fries were plentiful and warmish (blech). I ate some because this entrée was $15.00. FIFTEEN DOLLAR cold, vanilla, french fries. After that, we played \"Who Can Get the Server's Attention First?\" and pretty much had to throw our credit card at him, for him to come to our table and bill us out. No dessert offered (they have it).  My suggestions would be, get water on the table (we'll let you know if we don't want it, but it is Arizona).  Don't make people wait over an hour and then pay full price for their food or alternatively, throw us a round of drinks to keep us happy. Honestly, I think we were just lost in the crowd. So, I'm not highly offended at this place, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again.


The Highlights:

Sit outside at night if you can, desert scenery is beautiful
Seated immediately
Server was pleasant and gamely put up with our many dietary requests (We had several gluten free/dairy free eaters with us.)
Server was fairly knowledgeable. 
Food was good. Not great.
Service was slow, but I'll say that was because of how busy they were. 
We waited over an hour for our food. 
Over, overpriced for what they serve. Our bill was $190.00 -4 people, 4 drinks, 1 bottle of wine, 2 appetizers, 4 entrees. (At least that's what I think, but you be the judge.)

*Update: Points given to Chantal for getting back to me. That alone will make me come back."}
{"text":"Location is cool. Ambiance is nice especially during the Illuminarias. Food is interesting, i.e. Pork gumbo. Service poor. Guests love to wait 10 minutes after their reservation time, while walk in guests walk right in to an open table. Especially when our entire party actually arrived 15 minutes prior to reservation time. Lastly waiting 15+ min to cash out is just down right unacceptable. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is sort of a captive audience restaurant.  If you're making a (half) day of the gardens, it's worth coming here.  There's not a whole lot close by to compete with it.

The concept is farm to table, and the items on the menu seemed to follow that trend.  We both wanted to eat light that day, so both got the fish tacos (\"locally sourced\" Mahi Mahi??).  The flavors were good, but the execution could have been better (one example being the dry/burnt corn tortillas).  And the meal was definitely light--large appetizer portion.  Not all their meals were like that--the Sonoran Dog (with fries) looked fantastic and could feed two people, easily.  I'd recommend having an extended discussion with the waiter on what you want before you order.

The ambience was superlative.  We ended up inside, due to the crowds, but the views were fantastic out of large windows.  Just a great space and experience overall."}
{"text":"I should preface this by stating that my husband has Celiac, so has to be careful with cross-contamination of wheat. We asked our server about gluten-free dishes and he explained how the food prep was separated in the kitchen, but in a very dismissive way. We've learned to pay close attention to our server's demeanor when it comes to gluten cross contamination, so, in the nicest way possible, I asked another employee just to double check that his order would be gluten free. What can I say - I don't like to see my husband get sick. The result was a series of visits from our server and the owner, who both explained and re-explained their food prep policy and how it was already explained to us when we ordered. There was no \"Hey, I'm sorry you got that impression from your server, but he was right, we do prep gluten containing items in a totally separate area\", which we would have been happy with. Instead they both took turns awkwardly talked over us while we smiled and nodded while trying to enjoy our breakfast. I don't know how many times they explained that the owners daughter has Celiac and how the gluten-y food prep line was separate. WE GET IT. Long story short, they completely missed the point. I wouldn't have double-checked if our server wasn't so dismissive to begin with."}
{"text":"Amazing service and even better food! The food is so fresh and the staff is very friendly. Beautiful patio we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was fortunate to visit this little gem. I came with a large group and we ordered a little bit of everything. I was not disappointed. The food was spectacular! I thoroughly enjoyed everything I tried! The staff was friendly, the view was gorgeous. I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Tried to come here before with just my son & I and was told waiting was over an hour!!  But I saw open seats outside (which was where I had requested) so that left me with such a bad taste.  Husband brought us here for dinner and I'm sure glad he did!

Ordered:
Cactus Cosmo to drink. - soooooo good.  Not too sweet!

Bread & Butter - Yes.  So amazing! $6 and the butter is just incredible. 

Kids Mac & Cheese and an order of apple sauce. - I always taste my kids food.  No complaints!  Apple sauce was so good!

Korean Chicken Thighs served over Brussel sprouts. - So delicious!  The thighs were fried so well and the sauce was spicy but not to the point where you can't enjoy it.  The Brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly!  This was such an enjoyable dish!  More than a generous serving too!  I ate half and felt perfectly satisfied!  If you don't like spicy, this isn't your ideal meal.

Husband had the Bison Tenderloin - \"phenomenal\" (his words.  I didn't try it, too raw for me). 

I'd recommend eating here & sitting outside, it's very nice!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous gem! Couldn't believe how few people were here! The food was wonderful; the chef is creative and blends multiple styles of food. The service is outstanding! We'll definitely be back when back in town."}
{"text":"Sorry Gertrude's... seems they have a new chef and menu. The menu is not as unique as the old one. What happened to the \"Hot Mess\"? We went for lunch, the hostess seated us and said who would be taking care of us. Then a young lady brought menus and asked what we would like to drink so I ordered a glass of wine. Then another person came with my wine and took our menus. That was it. Nobody asked us what we wanted to order until I waved for some help and asked if someone could take our order. Now, they were not busy at all. Oh well, just a miscommunication I guess.
I had the tuna sandwich and the fries were good. The sandwich was not up to my expectations.
Something needs to change before I return. Too bad, I used to really like Gertrude's."}
{"text":"The atmosphere immediately radiates a calm and positive mood when you sit down. The menu was highly impressive and after ordering the iced coffee and the American breakfast plate, I begin appreciating the surroundings of the garden. The staff was beyond friendly from the waiter to the busser who offered to snap our photo. The bacon was perfectly tender. The fingerling potatoes were fulfilling and eggs cooked expertly.  Ambiance is off the charts and have already made recommendations to family. 

Highly recommend and will come back for cocktails or a meal here soon!"}
{"text":"Very crowded at lunch. Loved the hummus and pickled vegetables and the pea mint salad (very different and interesting combo)"}
{"text":"After an impromptu visit to the Gardens yesterday, we decided to see if they had a dress code and space for dinner.  We were dressed fine, they had an allergen menu and we were seated.  We were so well taken care of, the garden setting on the patio was gorgeous. I had steak with brussel sprouts and my husband had the pork porterhouse....we loved our food. We decided to have dessert, because I could, and although I needed to leave some because of a cookie being in mine, what I could eat was good.  All in all, a great experience."}
{"text":"We had an office lunch here & it was perfect! The patio was beautiful; the food great & the service 5 Star! After lunch we toured the gardens.  A perfect AZ winter afternoon! For groups - I suggest to talk to Michelle and she will take good care of you!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch while visit the gardens. Really loved the atmosphere inside and out.  There is a long bar and plenty of seating inside and outside. It was a very hot day in Phoenix but the server positioned an umbrella just right for our table outdoors. Our server was extremely friendly and explained the menu.  I had the smoked pork gumbo with an egg over medium. So delicious. It had pieces of smoked pork and sausage in a smoky sauce over corn bread with an egg on top. Delicious combo of flavors.  Prices were very reasonable and they even had a chill live singer."}
{"text":"Overrated place with subpar service and an inordinate long wait for your food once ordered.  We visited on a busy Sunday at 1:00pm and waited 15 minutes (not bad) for an inside table. However, our waitress was awful and inattentive. Once our salads and burgers were ordered it took over 45 minutes before we received our food.  Food was tasty but a bit pricey.  Further, we twice asked our server for the salt & pepper shakers and finally got her attention after a third time. Wow! At these prices management should retrain the staff, cooks, and the host on better service with speed and proper follow up to make customers feel more important."}
{"text":"Went with three other couples on February 14th. Absolutely the worst service we as a group EVER experienced. Not only did it take 45 minutes to get a cocktail but the wait staff was both argumentative and rude. At no point did any member of the staff, including the manager, apologize. The food was inconsistent to say the least. One guest ordered a \"special cocktail\" on your list.....you were out of the main ingredient! on Valentines Day you aren't properly stocked.......ridiculous.

Important to know, half of these 8 people have spent their careers in the restaurant industry. We were shocked that you would think you could be successful running a business in this manner."}
{"text":"I really want to rate Gertrude's more than 3 stars, but it wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be due to the costs and location. It does have a nice outdoor patio within the Desert Botanical Gardens, with heat lamps if needed. The servers are also friendly, but like to try and pull each plate away pretty quickly, which can make for some awkward moments. I get why, but it just seems unnecessary when the restaurant isn't packed. I ordered the \"Gertrude's Greens\" which sounded incredible, but lacked in appearance, ingredients, and flavor. It was supposed to have black kale in it, but I didn't see any at all. It was also supposed to have a Honey Lavender Vinaigrette, which I was hoping was going to be bursting with flavor. However, it did nothing of the sort. I'd like to try and make my own and see if I can't inspire more flavor. Good idea though! I also had the fish tacos, which were good, but kind of bland. I had to douse them in Tapatio to add some additional flavor. Although, I will happily mention that I could tell the fish was of good quality and the beans were really good! I was hoping it was just my food choices, but my Mom and others we were with said they had similar experiences with their dishes. 
I of all people understand that healthy/good quality food doesn't need to be overly seasoned. However, it can be a little seasoned. If not that, it can be accompanied with dipping sauces or salsas. I make lots of super healthy food for myself at home and don't always feel the need to season it, but when I go out and spend decent money on food I expect it to to have flavor. Just a thought!
Overall, it's worth coming here for a nice healthy bite when visiting the Gardens. The cocktails looked delicious, as well as the wine and beer options. If I came again, I would probably stick to a drink and an appetizer!

Ps - cute furry friends can be seen when dining outside. Definitely a nice addition!"}
{"text":"Sometimes it is the little things that finally throw you over the edge.  I have been back to Gertrude's a few times since my first review--I got a membership because I knew I would have lots of opportunities to take folks to the Chuhily exhibit.   As a result because Gertrude's is there I have ended up eating there.  Each time the experience has been impacted either by food that is bland to terrible to service that is so off and on.

Today however has given me the resolve to not go back.  Had breakfast there with a friend--ordered hot tea--they had no honey--for me not having honey is like for some folks not being able to drink black coffee.  Okay I get it sometimes you run out of things.  breakfast was two eggs, bacon, one slice of toast and six or seven fingerling potatoes--price point $12--not exactly inexpensive, but i get that the setting is gorgeous--food was okay--neither the best or worst eggs I have ever had

but here comes the little thing----they charge for jam for your one piece of toast.  they brought two tablespoons in a little bowl and for the privilege of having a little something sweet on your toast, you are charged a $1.50--but it's homemade they said--

In theory--I would hope that a restaurant at the level Gertrude's is attempting to be--that everything is homemade.  This charge offended my sensibilities of fairness and reasonableness--it can only be a slippery slope down to charging if you want silverware to eat with.  

That's it--I won't be back--for a $12 breakfast, a tablespoon of jam (which is what was used)  should not have a surcharge--

I am not sure what the Gertrude's business model is, but I hope there is some planning ahead when there are no longer stunning works of art to  lure people in--I can't imagines locals coming to this restaurant--just because---there are so many other choices--some also with views, who have the sense that good business model for exceptional dining experiences is not to nickle and dime people."}
{"text":"I brought my mom here for her birthday along with my daughter, boyfriend and his mom. I'm not upset about the food, it was tasty. But our service took a long time. Also, I had a reservation and told them it was my moms birthday and we would need a high chair for my daughter. They said \"we will do a birthday desert for your mom and we will have a high chair ready at the table\". I thought this was sweet. But the high chair wasn't ready at the table,
No big deal. They brought one over. But the service was soooooo slow. We never got bread for the table but every other table had some. And my mom never got her birthday desert. We were afraid to ask for it because we didn't want to wait another 25+ minutes for a desert. I'm just sad my mom didn't get that experience I hoped for her. But again, the food was good."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE. I wish I had gotten the hostess's name. We weren't able to be seated without a reservation which is totally understandable as there was an event in the evening, but it was hardly 3pm and the outside dining area was almost empty. I've worked in the service industry and would never speak to anyone that way. The way in which our group was addressed, like we weren't good enough. It truly hurt my feelings. The girl at the stand looked miserable and it definitely showed in her tone of voice. She didn't offer reservations for a different day, she didn't offer to notify us if space opened at the bar, she was completely unapologetic and seemed like she just wanted us to get out of her face. So disgusting."}
{"text":"Prices were expensive but the food was very good. 
Charged my meal and 10 minutes later my card was used online!
Called the manager and he pretty much said too bad 
Probably won't ever return here."}
{"text":"I went on a Thursday evening, waiting for a garden member to meet me to tour the gardens. I am disabled and parked my scooter outside, and walked in. I was asked if I had a reservation; I replied no, I was meeting a member and just needed to sit for a beverage and a bite. The room had a large bar, so I assumed the entire room was the bar (wrong on my part- it was bar and dining room combined)  and said \"I'll sit in the bar\" at which point the hostess gestured towards the bar stools.   When I told her I can't sit there due to disability, she said she had an empty table for two but there was a 6:30 reservation; if my friend was late in coming things would have to be changed up. I told her I had no problem leaving the table to park off somewhere else, like the empty table in the reception area.

I was seated, my drink order was taken, though it was slow in coming. The servers were polite and professional, accommodating as well.  Needing to wash my hands, I learned the restaurant did not have dedicated restrooms. They were across the garden plaza. Accordingly, I ordered a knife and fork meal so as not to have to touch my food with unwashed hands.

My meal came out swiftly after my beverage, which was a delicious AZ craft beer from Uncle Bear's brewery- the Mandarin Wheat.

My Blue Claw salad was made with blue claw crab meat formed in a sort of flat round timbale; about an inch tall and four inches in diameter. The crab meat was mixed with the roasted corn integrated inside, the avocado spread on top, the local cress garnishing above and two pork rinds atop.  I opted to have the chiles omitted.

It was delicious, though it's hard to go wrong with blue claw crab meat.  What was a bit surprising was it being an item on a seasonal menu that features locally produced food.  The main component of this salad came from the eastern seaboard- I grew up eating blue claw crabs caught in my own canal-front back yard.

My meal was enjoyed, but it was not enough to entice me back a second time, or to make a special trip simply to dine at Gertrude's."}
{"text":"Super food and atmosphere. I think you have to pay admission to the botanical garden but it was worth it."}
{"text":"So many good things but some big misses as well. No signs to get to this place so it is hard to find. My mouth was watering when I read the menu on line but got there and they only served a brunch menu on Sunday so very few items on line were available. Beet salad was good and fresh but expensive. We had the burrata with diced strawberries, pink pepper. It was different but good. It didn't come with bread. Had to buy bread separately for $6. 

I wouldn't return, the price isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Decided to try something new. I got there chorizo burrito and it was good. I really enjoyed the sour cream with the burrito. My friend got the French toast. I have never had French toast with cranberries and what looked to be cinnamon butter before. It is a bit more pricey but definitely nice to try something new. The scenery is worth the trip."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch (the only Sunday I was in town for) and to my dismay, they did not have the Hot Mess. After asking the wait staff why it wasn't on the menu anymore (the best selling item), I was disappointed to find out the menu was Cajun. Why would you have a Cajun menu at a Botanical Garden featuring Arizona Desert plants? The pricing was a bit high for what you get, but in all honesty, it wasn't bad, and it is at the Botanical gardens.

The smoked chicken salad sandwich was better than your average chicken salad, and the salad I got to accompany it was delicious! I would not write home about the smoked salmon and caviar!"}
{"text":"Great setting and atmosphere 
Good food for a special dinner
Unique menu if you are game for experimenting
Thank you for using locals
We were treated a dessert for our anniversary
But they charged us a dollar for it anyway 
Very odd
And it was deep fried doughnut holes
Yikes
I was disappointed
We were ready to order a nice dessert
I have not eaten deep fried in over 30 years
That was not a happy ending
The coffee was good 
We would go back maybe for lunch and dinner"}
{"text":"Gertrude's is a very good \"farm to table\" restaurant in a beautiful location with a great outdoor patio. Food was prepared well. We started with grilled asparagus and although some of the asparagus was very thin and burnt on some of the ends, the fried egg on top was a great addition and we would order this side again. We also had as a starter the whole grain with white quinoa; this was an excellent starter dish full of flavor and seemingly very healthy with sort of a blueberry taste. The King salmon was well prepared and the green mole sauce was very good addition. The only downfall was, the charge of 6$ for bread, although the bread was good and had the addition of grapes and rosemary baked in, I would not pay for the bread plate again. Gertrude's is open to the general public and does not require Desert Botanical Garden membership or admission, just check in at the gate."}
{"text":"My friend has told me about this place and she lives in Albuquerque. I finally decided to go. It was amazing. We both ordered the Boars Breakfast Burritos. It was made with fingerling potatoes. When I make those potatoes they taste horrible but here the chef knows how to cook. Everything was cooked to perfection. The meat was tender and moist. The potatoes were soft and delicious. The tortilla was just a wrap holding all the tasty things inside. It was not too much not too little it was just right. It was breakfast and our waiter told us we could order appetizers. Donut-holes! I think they were actually aebleskivers, but who really knows how to pronounce that for breakfast! They were really good. The came with dipping sauces. Raspberry (my favorite), caramel (Brad's favorite) and chocolate. The first two were quite good. Surprisingly the chocolate was not as good.  Everyone has their own tastes. It was hot and it was only 9:30 in the morning, but you can order beer in Phoenix. Brad tried the bottle of Grand Canyon Brewing. It was a coffee stout (I hope I got that right). Brad said it was smooth and the coffee was perfect. We are looking for this here locally, but nothing has turned up yet. Our server was quite good. I thing his name is Jash? Anyway he was great. His suggestions were right on. I almost forgot. Jash told us about the \"chile\" that comes with the burrito. I told him I liked it HOT, so he recommended a HOT read sauce. Brad likes a milder spice so he suggested the green sauce. WOW! Though it is not Hatch, it was really good. My noise was sniffling after I finished. The mild red we both decided was not to our liking. The portions are HUGE. We had breakfast again the next day. Next time we have a plan. We are going to share a burrito and french toast. That should be good enough for us. Oh and of course we worked up on appetite walking thru the gardens. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My table has been waiting for an hour to get our meal. When the manager came over to talk to us, he was very abrasive when he stated that he didn't know what happened to our order and then proceeded to claim it would come out within minutes. Needless to say, it was an awkward and uncomfortable moment had by all and the food wasn't even that great. Also doesn't help that we're headed to the Noches de las Luminarias and will lose time in the garden. Then the waiter decided to tell us the \"truth\" about losing our order. 

Edit: The bill was comped. The waiter was very kind about the situation."}
{"text":"We've been waiting so long for our food that I don't care what it tastes like anymore."}
{"text":"It is unfortunate that once again I write an unfavorable review for this establishment.  I do give seriously high marks to the owner of Gerturde's, Ms. Chantal H. for reaching out to us after reading our review of what was a really terrible experience at her establishment on December 29th of 2015.  She informed me in her email that her GM, Ms. Michelle Jacob was advised to contact us, yet to date there has been no communication from the management what so ever.  Actions do speak volumes, thus by the treatment our party experience the 29th of December, compounded by the apathy to our experience by the GM along with the mixed reviews here on Yelp, one can only assume that customers are just not that important at Gertrude's.  

For us, Gertrude's atmosphere and cost of cuisine does not outweigh the garden variety placation one may expect to receive should issues arise.  For a setting inside the beautiful Desert Botanical Gardens, a patron should perceive a tranquil and welcome experience. One enveloped by the sensation of amazing cuisine combined with your grateful content for the service given for your patronage.  But alas, none of this is evident, from all accounts observing the staff of Gertrude's the many times we have visited the Gardens, there is something missing, and from our experience we now know what that is.....   ownership of one's profession.  Not just pride in a job well done, but the professional demeanor and presence one gives when conducting themselves in their pursuit.  It is evident that not all customers are displeased with Gertrude's, and yet one can not help but wonder why there is so many unfavorable reviews for what \"should be\" a five star restaurant in the heart of one of the most beautiful places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner. Was a bit underwhelmed for the price. Here are the pro's and cons:

Pros:
Friendly staff
Nice patio atmosphere, very pretty. 

Cons:
Slow service - there were maybe 5 tables on the patio and 3 servers and it took quite a long time to get food. 
Mediocre drinks - Their Sangria was $9 and was a pretty small wine glass...with mostly ice and fruit. 
Mediocre food - The food sounded great on the menu...and it was ok...but not for the price. Flat Iron Steak for $27...wasn't bad...but it wasn't \"$27 good\" either.

I think expectations would have been tempered a bit more if the price was lower or the quality was higher. However, high priced...\"B- food\" never leaves a great taste in your mouth. 

I'm not an angry Yelper...but I was a bit underwhelmed for the price and just want other people to have tempered expectations. Wonderful atmosphere though. Love the Botantical Gardens!"}
{"text":"This place is one of those hidden gems, hiding within the Desert Botanical Gardens. The scenery is great, the food is incredible and the service is top notch! We came for Arizona Restaurant Week and the special menu was stellar! Brad was our server and he is the best! We will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Kind of under impressed. We've been here about a year ago and enjoyed it much more. We went for lunch. Beautiful setting and the service was good but slow. However we weren't in a hurry so it didn't matter.  My husband ordered the pulled pork gumbo with an egg and corn muffin. The presentation was beautiful and he thought it tastes great. I ordered the escarole salad with maple dressing, pomegranate seeds, candied pecans and goat cheese. Unfortunately the dressing made the lettuce look brown like old lettuce. Presentation boring. A couple of tiny pecan pieces and a few very small crumbles of goat cheese. Chicken or a LOT more cheese would have been a nice addition. This came with no bread so we ordered a \"bread coarse\". The toasted bread was black on some pieces and the non-toasted bread was rather dry. For dessert we shared a brownie with cranberry ancho sauce. Presentation was nice. It came with a \"scoop\" of vanilla bean gelato that was tablespoon size. The
Cranberry ancho sauce was very tasty and while the brownies tasted good they were really hard. Difficult to cut through with a knife. Go for the ambience but don't expect much from the food."}
{"text":"Very pretty location inside the Botanical Garden BUT very hard to find - We went for mother's day and we found ourselves very late because the address listed above takes you to the corner of Galvin Pkwy and McDowell Road which is definitely not where the restaurant is... Don't listen to your GPS or iphone! With no signs, and not ever previously having been to the gardens, there was no clear way to get there or know where to park.

The interior is simple and casual, but the menu is excellent with very unique, tasty, local dishes! There is a great private room located on the kitchen that is quiet, intimate, and gives you a direct view of all the action in the kitchen which is a really awesome feature."}
{"text":"We came here for Valentine's Day, and it was a lot of fun. Food was pretty good, atmosphere was beautiful. It wasn't fun walking from the parking lot in heels, but I know the botanical gardens isn't really designed for that."}
{"text":"Fresh food, friendly staff, & if you ear outside there are birds and squirrels that will come up to you. So cute & perfect for lunch outside. Great simple fresh menu."}
{"text":"Delicious, great service, incredible food.  The dining room is a little noisy, but everything else made up for it!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times-the food is okay, the outside patio beautiful. Unfortunately today, the front desk person told us there were no table available outside because of 40 more lunch reservations (it was 1 pm), in spite of them all being empty and a table readily available on opentable outside. It seemed he purposefully tried to not accommodate us.

Given that this is a pretty pricey place for lunch with mediocre food, with lots of other good options in the area, I found this attitude so annoying that we ended up leaving. I don't think I will come back to this place."}
{"text":"Four of us enjoyed a delightful lunch on the patio of this cafe. The weather was wonderful which helped: low 70s, no wind, etc. the setting was great: surrounded by cactus and other vegetation with visiting roadrunners and other birds. Our server was great, too: a pleasant young lady who knows the menu and was prompt and attentive. There is a decent wine list. There are a half dozen each appetizers, salads and sandwiches. What we had was good and more than we could finish. We didn't have room for dessert. The soup du jour was mushroom and well received. The burger, chicken salad sandwich and bologna sandwich were all great.  The price was on the high end for sandwiches but you have to pay for the ambiance. We will return I am sure.  You don't have to pay admission to dine at the restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and children and I decided to try somewhere different for breakfast this am.  I searched yelp for a spot that had good reviews and this is where we landed.  What an AMAZING surprise!  First of all, we had no clue that the botanical gardens even existed.  So cool, and right now they have a lit up glass art exhibit going on throughout the park called Chulily.  Really cool!  Our breakfast was delicious and super healthy.  I highly recommend the \"Garden Fritatta\".  The kids had the traditional \"American Breakfast\" and they loved it.  Best fingerling potatoes!  Our server, Mary, was so kind and caring and knowledgable.  You MUST try their housemade strawberry jam......holy cow that stuff is heavenly!  We had the pleasure of meeting the chef, Steven, who was so kind to give us a sample of their again, housemade donuts with 3 different dipping sauces......chocolate fudge, tequila lime custard and the richest caramel.  Sooooo yummy! Didn't catch the tall guy's name who was the manager I believe, but he was wonderful as well!  Thank you for making our everyday Saturday breakfast a surpisingly awesome experience.  We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Gertrude's restaurant is located behind the gift shop at the entrance of the gorgeous Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix. The restaurant serves sustainable dishes featuring ingredients from both their own patio garden and the community garden located in the Desert Botanical Garden. The ambience for dinner al fresco on the patio should be an automatic five-star experience... beautiful landscaping, lighted glass sculptures, sunset on the surrounding red rock formations, and stars shining brightly in the desert sky. The menu is seasonal, creative, and sounds delicious. Entrees run $18-40.00.  The restaurant was moderately busy and almost all of the patrons had dinner outside on my visit. Yet, not one table or place setting was set on the patio...just empty tables...no linens, placemats, candles, centerpieces, salt and pepper mills...nothing! They don't set your table even after you order.  This is acceptable for a picnic table at a roadside burger place but not an \"upscale\" dining establishment. Service was slow but hospitable (I even had to walk the bill inside to pay because I got tired of waiting.) Every table had a heat lamp. I was not offered a lamp and had to request it on a chilly night. The crafted Lavender Lemondrop cocktail simply was not good. I ordered the Arugula Salad with pomegranate seeds, candied pecans, blue cheese, and agave vinaigrette and it was delicious. The Blackened Scallops with roasted corn maque choux and Tabasco Hollandaise arrived cold and undercooked. With a $35 price tag...they were sent back to the kitchen. The second order was cooked perfectly. The maque choux was fresh and as good as any I have eaten in Louisiana. I have to say, however, my overall experience was disappointing. This restaurant makes me appreciate fine dining in Europe which is truly \"fine dining\"...food cooked perfectly, impeccable service, and attention to detail and presentation at the same price of a meal at Gertrude's. I can't wait to go back to see the Desert Botanical Gardens again but I will enjoy my meal somewhere else in the Phoenix area. Dinner, lunch, and dinner is served at Gertrude's.  www.gertrudesrestaurant.net"}
{"text":"Gertrude's is located within the Botanical garden. We were both hungry, but not expecting much from a park venue. Menu looked very upscale casual, so we decided to take a chance. Husband ordered the BLT sandwich special served on a brioche bun, 2 tiny tomatoe slices & 1000 island dressing. Waaay too much dry bread overpowered the BLT; D-minus. I ordered the smoked salmon salad. While the ingredients were fresh, the salmon was soggy & flavor overall bland; C-minus. Park food would have been better."}
{"text":"One of the best ways to see how a business is run is when things go wrong. It's easy to be great when everything is right, but when there's a snag, it's too easy for things to fall apart.
The last visit I made to Gertrude's gave me a great picture of the way the staff makes sure things stay right.
Three of us went in Easter morning for a snack. None of us were hungry enough for a full meal, but wanted something. We each had the fresh lemonade with herbs and berries (I am not generally a fan of lemonade, but this was fantastic), and decided to share the special of hot cross buns with cinnamon butter and the garden frittata.
The room is casual and comfortable, with a fantastic patio. The food was fresh, well prepared and beautifully presented. Our server was attentive and had a great personality. I thought the prices were high for the quantity served, but much like resort dining, you are paying for the location. I wanted to treat the gals to our snack, so I slipped the server my debit card.
All was well until he brought the check. It wasn't the card receipt for me to sign, it was the check. I reminded him about my card, he acknowledged and walked away. A few minutes later, the manager came over. It seems my card was misplaced. She gave me her business card, apologized, comped the bill and was taking down my contact information when the server came back - having found my card.
Naturally, I was relieved. I was also surprised and impressed that they still insisted on not charging us for the meal. 
With how promptly and professionally it was handled, and the great customer service that was shown - in addition to the fact I thoroughly enjoyed all I ate and drank while there - I will definitely be back - probably every time I go to the Garden!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick easy brunch place that was not a greasy spoon.  Gertrude's exceeded all our expectations. It's at the entrance of the Botanical Gardens and you do not have to pay admissions to Gardens. Staff is friendly and efficient. The menu is simple gourmet locally delicious and visually tight-good targeted items for brunch and lunch- not a bunch of gooey typically sugary buttery items.  Steak and eggs with fingerling potatoes was perfect- clean and delicious and plated in a modern elegant way. They have a strong cold filtered iced coffee that has a great kick. They also has a bar serving very cool creative cocktails and sitting where family could relax after a morning at the gardens. Indoor and outdoor seating- views of huge cactus surround the restaurant. Worth a stop- you will feel good after this experience."}
{"text":"There are so many things that I love about Gertrude's..where do I start? It is my \"go to\" place for all out of town friends. The menu is fairly diverse..I was even able to feed my vegan grandkids there last week. For the meat eaters the flat iron steak is good and the fresh fish was delicious..think it was branzino....oh so good! And don't leave without trying the Elote..Youll never want boiled corn again. Even the bread is awesome..good and grainy and purchased from a local bakery. The best perk of this restaurant ( aside from great food and a lovely patio) is Master Mixologist, Roberto!!! He has created some incredible cocktails that will make you come back..just for the cocktails. My very favorite is the Lavender lemon drop which is the best drink I've ever had. I love lavender and have tried any cocktail in town that includes lavender. None of the other lavender drinks that I've had in multiple restaurants can touch this cocktail. It's truly delicious. If nothing else..it's worth the trip for this little sip of heaven. I may have to stop in tonight!"}
{"text":"Came into town to cheer a friend on in the Phoenix Marathon and we were looking for things to due that evening. What caught our attention was the Bruce Munro exhibit at the botanical gardens. What luck, they have a restaurant there so that is 2 birds with one stone as they say. 

Due to some scheduling mishap, my party of 4 thought we had a reservation at 7 on Saturday night but it turned out to be for Sunday! . I cannot thank Max enough for the save. Thanks to what I can only consider to be good karma a large party didn't show up and thanks to a local family we were able to split the table. Yes!

We sat down just grateful that we could seated but little did we know we were in for a dinning experience. Gertrude's is another in a growing trend of farm to table and they delivered. One of us ordered the bread service with the tea butter for the table. It came out warm and with just the right amount of crunch in the crust. Excellent. Not certain I  tasted any tea in the butter but the bread was definitely better with the butter then without and that bar was already set high.  

Another diner had the Gertrude's Greens salad and was quite pleased with the dressing. Just the right amount of lemon. 

I splurged and ordered the flat iron steak. It came out the requested medium and was quite juicy and flavorful. The lone male in our group order the prime strip loin with bacon marmalade. He was hesitant about it until he tried it. Then he was slathering it on every bite so I guess it was good. 

Someone else got the duck breast which I had a taste of. It was cider cured and amazing. I will hopefully be able to get that next time I am in town. It came with broccoli and truffle steel cut oats. Who knew oats could be served like that?

Cocktails were not weak and next time I will be getting the house margarita. It had just the right amount of heat and kick to it.   

Our server Lisa was excellent. All in all a fantastic meal in a great location. Next time I am in town I will definitely try and come here for the brunch."}
{"text":"Pretentious, but not because the food or setting is above average. Some of the most plain bland chicken sandwiches and fish tacos I've ever tasted.  It is very bland overpriced medium/small portions. 

The botanical garden is pretty cool, and this place came highly referred as a romantic great lunch spot, but did not deliver.

It is not worth your time, plan on eating somewhere else after. Unless you like bland overpriced food and the convenience of being at the garden already."}
{"text":"Stopped in while visiting DBG in April when my mom was visiting from out of town.  I felt the drinks were a little pricey for brunch, but the food was good and servings were large.  

Mom and I both had French toast and sausage.  We should have split our orders!  The plate of French toast was enormous, both of us only ate half.  It was possibly the best French toast I've ever had!  Served with slivered almonds and just a bit of syrup - which was enough, the French toast was moist but not soggy.  The side of sausage was four large sausage links (which again, neither of us finished).  They boxed out French toast and sausage up for us to take home and we enjoyed breakfast again the next day.  

Hubby had steak and eggs - steak was cooked to his request and he said it was very tasty with only the tiniest piece of fat on it.  We all had cocktails before brunch, the best one of the bunch was the Sangria.  

Service was a bit slow at first, but once we ordered, food was delivered quickly and they checked on us often."}
{"text":"On a Saturday morning in which my family and I celebrated my sister's birthday at the Phoenix Zoo, we needed a spot to go for lunch afterwards.  Gertrude's was by far the closest restaurant nearby so off we went.  I've come to the Botanical Gardens a bunch of times, but have never dined here.  Gertrude's is located right near the front entrance of the Botanical Gardens and fortunately doesn't require a Garden admission to get in.  The restaurant is enormous with a bunch of seating both inside and out (I'm guessing at least 200 seats).  Despite it's size, I've seen this place packed particularly at night during Luminaria season.  We were able to get a patio table for 7 pretty quickly for a Noon brunch.

The brunch menu differs a bit from the dinner menu so I can't speak for what the food is like after 4pm.  Brunch options range from the fairly typical all American breakfast options to light lunch options, but with their own twist.  Gertrude's sources a bunch of their stuff locally and makes a point of it to say so.  None of which is that unusual in today's up and coming restaurant scene of course, but its pretty clear the Botanical Garden staff wants to remind you that their on site restaurant takes its cuisine seriously.  I have to say I was pretty impressed with our server Matt.  He was unusually knowledgable about the food on the menu including the cooking methods used and even went out of his way to say what was good and not so great that day.  Almost as if the chef himself was our server for the day.

Matt was particularly enthusiastic about a menu item they call the Breakfast Bowl.  Its a smoked pork gumbo that they put in a bowl on top of a bed of corn muffins and top with eggs any style.  I love me some good gumbo so I went with that option with over medium eggs per Matt's recommendation.  I also got a side order of their fingerling potatoes as Yelpers seemed to rave about those.  To wash it all down I got their seasonal red sangria which uses a variety of fresh seasonal locally grown fruits.

The sangria was a super refreshing start.  Not too sweet with a smooth cold finish.  The fact that it was served in a red wine glass was a bit odd to me, but no complaints about the drink itself.  As for the main event, the gumbo was pretty decent.  The corn muffin and roux used in the gumbo was excellent, as were the bits of sausage they included.  The pork was pretty good too though it might've perhaps been cooked down a little too much as the pork just disintegrated rather than pulled apart.  It didn't hurt the flavor profile too much, but the texture was a little odd.  The fingerling potatoes were seasoned well and the side order was very generous, though perhaps they could add just a tad more olive oil.  All in all though, a solid brunch.

Total cost for the food, drink, tax, and tip came to about $33.  A better than average value in my opinion.  I give Matt some pretty solid marks for helping us with our menu choices as the rest of my family seemed thoroughly enjoy their meal.  And as many have mentioned, its hard to beat the ambience of Gertrude's when the weather it just right.  The view from the patio in particular is work making a reservation for.  So if you're planning on making a trip to Botanical Gardens, or are just in the neighborhood looking for a sit down spot as we were, Gertrude's is a hideaway within a hideaway.  In the middle of a densely populated desert metropolis no less."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch when visiting the garden. Both entrees were poor.

KFC chicken is better than their fried chicken and the tuna was too salty and not cooked to specification."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The staff is consistently professional and friendly and the food is always delicious!! Chef Matthew Taylor is creative and talented. We've always had a great time and a great meal. Can't forget the beautiful atmosphere; it's good for dinner in the desert with friends or visitors to get a taste of Arizona. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time at Gertrude's. We arrived at 11 on a Tuesday morning but it was 'free' day, so it was busy. I ordered ordered the Korean Chicken Thighs.  The others ordered the Poke, a scoop of Chicken salad and the Gertie burger. It all came to 
$70 plus tip. 

The chicken (mine) came with a zesty, creamy aioli and braised Brussels sprouts. There were three crispy, boneless thighs and about six split sprouts. It was very good, having a higher than average spice level, good char on the sprouts and juicy, crispy, perfectly cooked chicken. 

The Poke was fresh, with about 10 1\" cubes plus aioli. Too expensive for the value tho. 

The burger was well received, with compliments given to the aioli and the bun. 

The chicken salad was, well, chicken salad. 

Not the best value but there were definitely some well done components."}
{"text":"Best to make a reservation - altho some nights like tonight find it almost empty. Lovely time to sit on the patio and watch the moon and Venus in conjunction 
Oh my glass of wine and an appetizer are lovely too. Stop by when in south Scottsdsle"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere. The food was delicious and the wait staff was on point. Highly suggest the salmon tartar with caviar."}
{"text":"Beautiful location.  Great food.  Not a typical menu but just order and enjoy!  Tomato salad was awesome."}
{"text":"Gertrude's at The Desert Botanical Garden is a very unique concept  to arrive at DBG. You do not need to pay garden admission to dine at the restaurant. Those who pay to enter the garden have a wristband. If you have not visited the garden you must do so.

We were celebrating 2 August birthdays and had lunch and ordered the 3 napkin smoked swine sandwich with fries for $13.,the small beet salad for $6, and the mahi tacos with beans for $17. It was Winey Wednesday the day we visited which means all bottles are 1/2 off. So we chose the DSB Pinot Grigio which is from Rutherford winery. Very nice light wine.

There is a nice large outdoor patio for seating that was not utilized in August, but I am sure as soon as the heat dies down it will be very well used. The actual restaurant is not too large for seating. The bar looks very well stocked and the kitchen is open concept.

Happy Hour is daily from 3pm-6pm and beer & house wine is $5. $2 off house cocktails. No appetizer specials at this time.
Other daily specials are
M & F happy Hour all day
T- $7 all day you call it
W- 1/2 off bottles of wine
Th-$5 draft beer
Sun.- $6 Sangria's

Parking is complimentary at the garden,just need to walk a bit depending on where you have to park to the garden entrance.
I believe the ceramic designs on the wall are done by artist Jim Sudal from Scottsdale.
I would recommend you try it once,probably not going to be my hang out,just because of the prices.
Our waiter was very friendly and helpful with menu suggestions."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in front of the Desert Botanical Gardens and features farm to table food.  It is very pricey!  I had lunch with a friend and we ordered the quinoa, which was very good. Small portion, perfect to share. Then I had a french dip sandwich which was served in a soft french roll with some kind of mayonaise horseradish spread and the dip. It was just ok.  I thought the roast beef was a little taste-less, and I didn't realize they were going to put they mayo-horseradish sauce on it as I would have preferred it without. My companion ordered the steak with the peppercorn sauce. That was absolutely delicious!  The steak was excellent!  With each of us having a beverage (no alcohol) the bill came to a whopping $80.000!! This is by the far the most expensive lunch I have had in a long time!  I would definitely recommend the steak and the quinoa dish.  

For the price they charge, I was disappointed in the level of service. They have a great chef, but train your servers better.  My companion left a very generous tip, which I thought was way too much. $20 for lunch??? (so the total was $100 for lunch for 2 people)

It is a little bit of a walk from the parking lot, but parking is free and you don't have to enter the botanical garden to eat at the restaurant.  It was 120 when we were there so it wasn't crowded. In nicer weather they also have seating outside.  We had reservations, but didn't need them."}
{"text":"Gertrude's, at the Desert Botanical Gardens, is a wonderful restaurant, set amid the beautiful desert scenery.  It is located next to the gift shop, near the entrance.  Me and a friend visited Gertrude's on Monday night, while at the gardens to see the new Chihuly sculptures.  The food was fantastic.  Our waitress was wonderful.  We split a bottle of red wine ($30), and each ordered the Green Chile Pork stew ($11).  We split the Salmon salad ($18), and also split the Tequila Citrus Cheesecake ($8).  The prices are mid-range - not too expensive, but not cheap, either.  The food was all very fresh and delicious.  I plan to make Gertrude's a regular stop on my visit to the Gardens.  We had a wonderful time exploring the gardens to see the magnificent Chihuly sculptures - Gertrude's was part of that wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful menu. Fabulous food. Gertie Burger with arugula salad, candied walnuts, potato fingerlings. Yum. Creative dessert menu. The carrot custard was delightful and beautifully presented, iIt tastes better than it sounds.) Servers Brad and Luis are outstanding. And the setting of the Desert Botanical Gardens is peaceful. We recommend Gertrude's!"}
{"text":"I can't believe such amazing food comes out of the kitchen at the Desert Botanical Gardens!  This place is great...open with beautiful views of the garden and nicely appointed.  The service was attentive and friendly.  But, the food is what really shines here!  Try the vegetable risotto with a glass of sauvignon blanc...best I have ever tasted!"}
{"text":"BELOW AVERAGE

The five of us had lunch here while visiting the wonderful Desert Botanical Garden. We wanted food, they provided it, we ate it. However, this is sadly an unmemorable and sub-standard place. The menu looked great, but the food was merely fair, the ambiance mediocre, and the service slow and weak. I had the Heart of Palm Salad and you needed a magnifying glass to locate the 5 shards of palm located under the dry and tasteless over cooked pieces of plantain."}
{"text":"Beautiful, amazing food, priceless location, well educated and friendly servers, and AMAZING cocktail / wine selections. I adore this restaurant. 

I could go on and gush about it, but it really speaks for itself the first time you go."}
{"text":"Horrible. No other word describes this. 
1.  Hummus wrap had a slush-ball consistency. Fries were decent
2. Lemonade for $4 reeked of grenadine. My wife's iced-tea was okay
3.  Waitress did not offer refills."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar for 10 minutes being overlooked and downright ignored. We were acknowledged once and told that he would be with us shortly, but received nothing but rude behavior for the next five minutes...so we left.  We had been here several times before with decent service and food. Not again after being blown off by not just one server, but two. Especially after someone else walked up to the bar and received service as soon as he walked up . Not to mention they also served the person sitting next to my husband ."}
{"text":"This place is most excellent. I will note their prices are higher than one would expect.. but I honestly do not think people consider the price it costs the restaurant to have farm grown, local grown, fresh shipped and prepared foods. Their salmon is entirely great quality. The servers are very considerate and help you navigate your menus as well as recommendations! When you first go to a restaurant you never know what to get, there are so many options so it is nice to have recommendations based on your tastes. They are a 5 star In my book"}
{"text":"A rewarding break from routine restaurants for brunch, Gertrude's offers a very tranquil setting with excellent service. The burgers are a standout - even with the competition in the East side - and they were cooked perfectly to our request.  The brioche buns yummy and fresh. Their homemade chips could be hot off the fryer but were not. However, ambience, service and burgers make this a spot to return to."}
{"text":"When we were escorted to our table, I noticed there were some tables with sturdy iron chairs and some with folding chairs. In deference to my large husband, and to avoid another broken hip from a possible broken chair, we politely asked for a table with iron chairs. We were denied and told that was not possible. Asked for a manager who told us it was not possible to change our table to one with different chairs, but that they would bring iron chairs over to the table we we at. It all seemed so ridiculous and unwelcoming, the fact that they couldn't reseat us in the beginning (plenty of tables open for same waitress) and then to make us the center of attention by arguing with us that the best they could do is change out chairs in a big fuss. No customer service. Food was okay only. Reason did not leave was because it was a special occasion, which did not start out pleasantly."}
{"text":"We went to Gertrude's this past week.  The quality of the food was very good but the servings were skimpy to small.  The beet salad was really small and they didn't serve any bread with it at all.  A side of bread was 4 or 6 dollars more.  For a main course course the mahi tacos was 2 small tacos and beans. The waitress was lousy too and never re-filled our water.  The vegetarian main course was good but for 18 dollars was really small.  I left hungry and will never go back"}
{"text":"4 words to describe Gertrude's; expensive, small portions & hot. Although the food wasn't horrible the portions were lacking & you would think being in 103 desert heat they would turn the AC on more! It's maybe worth a Instagram pic but save your $. On the plus side the service was impeccable!"}
{"text":"This was a really nice place to have breakfast.  Beautiful view and great service. The Eggs Benedict is delicious!  My husband had the brisket which was also amazing.  

Try the white sangria which was refreshing and a great way to start a nice brunch."}
{"text":"Love it! This is one of the few places in Phoenix I will eat meat, as it is all organic and local! The food is delicious, and they have some very creative drinks. The service is great.

I recommend sitting outside if the weather is good, as you have beautiful views. The interior is also nice, and really open, so you still have some nice views as well."}
{"text":"The Arizona Cactus and Native Flora Society. Doesn't that sound kind of like the Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts League? That was the group of hens Lucy and Ethel joined and then had to convince Ricky to direct the league's annual fundraiser while Marion Strong cackled like a rooster when she entered the room with her ugly hats. Yeah, I remember \"I Love Lucy\" not from its original run (despite rumors to the contrary) but from the reruns that played over and over again after school. But the Arizona Cactus and Native Flora Society was a real group in 1936 headed by a Phoenix social doyenne named Gertrude Wilson.

She spearheaded the effort that resulted in the gorgeous Desert Botanical Garden in Papago Park (review: http://bit.ly/2iTMXzG), so it came as no surprise that the adjoining restaurant was named after her. I came in here after a couple of hours in the blazing sun as I was studying the various cacti along the walkways. It was a pleasant, country-club-style space that appeared to attract customers in their golf shorts. I still had plenty of time to get back to the airport to catch my flight, so a light lunch sounded like a reasonable option here. Since there were only a couple of couples at the bar, I must have amounted to the lunch rush since Gertrude's is not the type of place that spontaneously attracts passers-by.

I decided to go for the $12 Arugula Salad with pomegranate seeds, candied pecans, and blue cheese, all of it drizzled with an agave vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/2zD6HxC). Quite a mound of leafage and quite tasty. For a side, I went for the $7 Roasted Vegetables which was quite a cornucopia of root vegetables, potatoes, and squash, all of them drenched a bit too much in olive oil but I wasn't complaining (photo: http://bit.ly/2zCitst). It was most satisfying. Truth be told, I could have sneaked in an add-on of flat-iron steak for $9, not bad for five ounces, but I showed more discipline than I normally do on a business trip. Gertrude would have likely disapproved anyway.

FOOD - 4 stars...light fare well done if not too creatively, a bit too much oil on those veggies
AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...casually upscale place seems a good fit for the cacti garden
SERVICE - 4 stars...quite attentive...who else was there to serve?
TOTAL - 4 stars...\"Welcome to the Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts League...Marion, stop cackling. I've been waiting 10 years for you to lay that egg!\""}
{"text":"I've Been here several times within last six months and have never had a reason to dislike the people or food. The setting is amidst a unique cactus garden. Seating is either inside or outside. I prefer eating in the relaxing desert scape that's afforded outside. I've dealt with multiple servers and ordered various food items with flawless delivery and presentation. Table service impeccable. Tasty deserts as well. Give this place a visit and walk off them calories in the adjacent gardens."}
{"text":"Any restaurant that scores a D from the County Health department is disgusting.  Even more disgusting is this place is supposed to be upscale. Unfortunately their prices exceed their cleanliness."}
{"text":"Delicious upscale restaurant at the Desert Botanical Gardens. The very fine quality ingredients were expertly prepared and everything we ate had superb flavor and interesting ingredients. This would be a perfect place for a \" nice lunch out\" and no doubt a beautiful venue for an event or party. It is a higher price than many area restaurants , but absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"Main entres were good.  I had the Gertie Burger which is big. I had to forego the wonderful bun or I wouldn't be able eat most of it. The peppered chips do not have a lot of pepper on them but that was okay with me. The Bloody Mary I ordered was bloody aweful. Really, worst Bloody Mary ever! Tasted like over salted cocktail sauce swimming in horse radish."}
{"text":"Service was exceptionally rude.  Many menu items were unavailable, or were modified from what was listed.  They even ran out of several types of soda while we were having lunch.  I overheard several tables being told the same - \"sorry, we're out of those for the day.\"  The waitress had the audacity to ask me what was wrong with my face when I seemed displeased at the news that I wouldn't be receiving what I ordered.  Gertrude's is obviously not managed correctly - it most likely gets by due to the popularity of the gardens, which were fabulous.  Skip this one and head somewhere else for lunch after a visit to Desert Botanical Garden."}
{"text":"Terrible service. After 15 minutes of being left unattended, we had to ask for someone to take our order.  Once we finally got a waiter, we ordered a hamburger, with a special emphasis on \"no cheese\", as my daughter has a severe allergy. The burger arrived with cheese, which we sent back to have remade. They brought the same burger back, with most of the melted cheese scrapped off, leaving remnants of cheese on the bun.  Apparently it's too much trouble for this restaurant correct it's errors properly. Considering the potential allergic consequence of this obvious act of laziness, I felt compelled to write this review. Do not go here."}
{"text":"The hamburger was really good, but I did not like the choices of wine - I am a Pinot Noir fan and couldn't find anything I liked. Service was good - I would go back again if I was visiting the Garden :)"}
{"text":"I took the hubs and dad here for Father's Day dinner and we truly loved our meal. I had the bloody mary mussels and I honestly could have poured the sauce into a cup to drink every last drop it was so good! Other highlights from our party's order included the BEAUTIFUL beet salad and the short ribs which my dad devoured. 

The 5th star here goes to service. Our baby was a bit fussy and one of the servers (not ours) came up and said that she would be happy to walk our baby around and entertain her with the toys in the (fabulous!) gift shop while we enjoyed our meal. She said that when she was a young mom a server at a restaurant offered to do the same thing for her so she was paying it forward. So, yes, we basically received free babysitting at this lovely restaurant. Our server was very attentive too, and I want to give him a special shout out for accommodating our martini with blue cheese olive request - since they didn't have pre-made blue cheese olives he used a pastry bag to fill olives with blue cheese himself. My kind of guy!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, the cocktails were very good, the waitress was terrific,...but the whole experience was overpowered by flies that relentlessly buzzed about our heads and food (I killed two).  it overlooks the botanical gardens but the interior looks like a remodel/re-purpose job that missed the mark."}
{"text":"Beautiful garden courtyard setting!

Right when we got to the DBG, I went in and scoped the place out.  The hostess informed me that I should make reservations now for lunch (got there at 10am).  Good idea!  We had lots of time to do the butterfly exhibit and walk around the grounds a bit. 

They were pretty busy when we got back there around noon, so call in for reservations if you're planning to go.  We preferred to be seated outside to soak up the beautiful cool and sunny weather.  They offered mimosas and bloody Mary...I was soooo tempted.  Next time.  My little cutie pie ordered grilled cheese sandwich with a side of fries and cranberry juice.  When it came out, I knew he would not like it.  Melted American cheese between two slices of white bread is not his thing.  He's used to fontina, havarti or aged white cheddar and whole grain bread.  After long walks, I crave for a good hearty salad...beet salad in this case.  While I love the use of multi colored baby beets, I was disappointed in four round bunny pellet-like goat cheese.  It was spread out on the plate to make it look like a good amount...it was barely peeking out.  \"You could do a little more lettuce, eh?\"  My husband snickered.  I gave him the stink eye.  I also gave his  Mahi mahi tacos a look over.  I should've gotten that.  He said the blandness could've been remedied by a spicy salsa on the side.  Nevermind.  They do cater to an elderly crowd and had just opened and need to work the kinks out.

We're going back for the breakfast menu to try out the mimosas and bloody Marys with that!  And MORE GOAT CHEESE please!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here with my boyfriend's big family for the first time for Sunday brunch, and I must say that I definitely left fully satisfied!!

I gave this restaurant five stars because:

1.)  Service is excellent!
We had a group of 14 people and not once did I have to flag down a waitress, might I add that we did have two waitresses though but they both attended to our every want and need. I never ran out of coffee nor water.

2.)  The food is DELICIOUS!!!
An assortment of toasted bread came out ahead of our entrées with what seemed to look like homemade whipped butter (not sure if it was homemade and whipped but it seemed that way). The breads were very flavorful, some with grains and spices, some with just spices, etc... Just excellent toasted bread and butter that tasted differently than any other bread I've tasted at other restaurants.

Their hummingbird nectar that came with my coffee is superb!!!!! Yes, you heard right, hummingbird nectar!!! You can have sugar, Splenda, etc., but if your coffee didn't come with hummingbird nectar make sure to ask your waitress for some so you can at least try it! It was my first time ever trying the nectar and it definitely won't be my last... Now if I can just try to find some to keep in my home for my coffee, or tea or everything!

As for our entrées, everyone loved their food! A lot of us ordered their signature dish (\"Hot Mess\") which was what the waitress recommended--we were all impressed! The chef made the \"Hot Mess\" particularly in the huevos rancheros version for that day; It included green chile pork, poblano mole, Az. Cheese Co jack cheese, crow's dairy quark, and cotija cheese in between layers of tostadas topped with two sunny side up eggs. You can bet on it that I will be back to eat the \"Hot Mess\"! My mouth is watering thinking about it...

We had them make a cake (calling a week beforehand) for the celebrant and it was delectable!! They were also very organized with their slicing of the cake and plating/serving. The cake was a strawberry shortcake, but it was definitely no strawberry shortcake I've ever tasted. The cake was perfect--not too sweet, not too dry, not too wet/moist...it was just the right amount of ingredients! We all loved it!

I assure you that whatever you decide to get at Gertrude's you will not be disappointed. I will absolutely positively return as a happy and hungry customer!"}
{"text":"So this is our second visit to Gertrude's our last  visit was for New Years Eve 2016-2017. For this visit we where celebrating my birthday and to attend the 2017 Las Noches de las Luminarias. We made reservations for 4 but the Flu threw a wrench into our plans. So last minute changes where bring down the festivities. We were running late but called ahead and Gertrude was accommodating. Our server made our night with his gesture of dessert and great service. Thank you Gertrude's for making my Birthday and our New New Year so memorable!"}
{"text":"Super cute eatery for after your stroll around the gardens! I was a bit worried I wouldn't have any options after looking over the menu (because of my dairy and egg allergies) but the waiter was happy to accommodate--despite them having just changed the menu the night before. I ended up having the smoked salmon salad which was topped with pork rinds! It was super original and tasty. The dressing was great too; they must make it in house. Will definitely be back on my next trip back to the gardens. 

One suggestion: I would love if they could add a \"vegan\" distinction to dishes along with the existing \"vegetarian\" one. It'd make it easier for people with dietary restrictions to identify their options better :)"}
{"text":"I am a member of the DBG and had just been to Gertrude's the week before which was a great experience so when my friends asked where they could take me for my birthday it was at the top of my list. I had made a reservation for 6:15 but arrived a bit early so we had a drink at the bar. The bartender, Sam, was wonderful and the garden rita was delicious. Then we were seated on the gorgeous patio and looked forward to a great evening. 

Our waiter did not show up for a while and when he did he was completely disengaged and clearly did not want to be there. He knew nothing about the menu, had no recommendations and just seemed plain grumpy. At one point he even told us that he was supposed to get off at 6:00 - so why did he take our table when our reservation was after that time?! My friend asked if we could order the special macaroni and cheese that the bartender had us salivating over when he described it because it was my birthday. He did bring out a very small cup of macaroni and cheese with a candle but it was not the special macaroni and cheese, just one from the kids menu. 

When we were about halfway done with our food, he did not offer us more drinks or dessert, just brought the check. When I said we wanted to order dessert he seemed upset and we felt like we were causing a big hassle. I felt embarrassed that I had suggested Gertrude's. The food was good but not worth putting up with the bad service.

After we paid our check we were still hanging out talking and he was gone. Nobody else came by to offer water, thank us for coming or anything. Very disappointing birthday experience . I'm giving 2 stars only because of the previous good experience with the hope that things improve."}
{"text":"I've been eagerly awaiting the opening of Gertrude's. Tonight, I was able to stop in for after-work wine and apps and I was not disappointed. The place is lovely - nice outdoor patio and great art on the walls. We ordered three appetizers; carpacio, stuffed dates and brussel sprouts. 

While clearly not a full meal, this was a great way to try out the restaurant. The dates were AMAZING. The setting is superb. I'm going back on the weekend for breakfast."}
{"text":"Gertrude's has been on our list of places to get to on trips to AZ for years....we only just made it happen recently, and it was a lovely lunch experience.  We sat outdoors in the patio (reservations recommended).  Our waiter was a foodie and very helpful in describing the cocktail and craft beer selections, as well as steering toward the best menu options that would be tasty yet still leave room for a dessert.  

While we waited for our reservation time, we were able to stroll through the gardens."}
{"text":"Ugh, I've kinda been dreading writing this review. I came in here for lunch on a weekday. I used to work in Scottsdale, and my girlfriend worked in Phoenix so this was the place we decided to meet halfway one day. We each brought a friend. 

First off, the signage isn't so good. This place is in the middle of the botanical gardens and Yelp could only get me so far, and that was to the parking lot. After wondering around a bit we did find the place. 

The service was just plain slow. They weren't very busy, but the waitress managed to disappear for 20 minutes at a time. 

My friend and I both got the 3 napkin smoked swine at the waitresses recommendation. Neither one of us were blown away. It was different that I expected for one. I saw a picture on Yelp that was supposed to be that sandwich and what came out was not that. It's an open face sandwich broken into four pieces. So it basically looked like four pieces of bruschetta and then a bowl that took up 1/2 the plate filled with a sauce for dipping. The sauce just didn't have a lot going on in my opinion. It wasn't spicy, it wasn't rich, it wasn't salty, it just lacked identity. The pork itself was smoked to perfection so I will not take that away from them. 

In the end, I'm guessing they have some great food there, but I missed it on the day I visited and had bad service. Unfortunately, I no longer live in the valley and can't say I will be going back to give it another shot when I visit."}
{"text":"A beautiful restaurant inside new of the most special botanical gardens in the country. We enjoyed lunch today and the place was just bustling with people on a perfect sunny day. I enjoyed the kale, jicama, asparagus salad, but was really coveting the Niman beef cheeseburgers floating by! Be sure to order the flour less chocolate soufflé/cake as its worth every single calorie!"}
{"text":"Stumbled in here while photographing the sunset over the cacti. Wanted something light. Enjoyed the Whole Grain Quinoa Salad with Salmon. Nicely done."}
{"text":"The tea was excellent. My burger and fries hit the spot. Sat outside, nice breeze, soft music and the center water fountain made for a great lunch. Highly recommend this place to be included in your visit to the desert botanical gardens!"}
{"text":"Gertie's Burger was top notch! Albondigos soup and salad were delicious as well. The salad isn't your typical romaine or iceberg. Be prepared for sweet pea and mixed greens. 
Sitting just inside the outside was perfect atmosphere without the sun. 

The kids menu was perfect with a little something for any palate."}
{"text":"Extremely over priced. Kids meal are very different. Nothing that my kids enjoyed. 2 adult entrees and 2 kids meals cost over $100 before 20% tip. Great service but will not be back"}
{"text":"So... This is one of those \"fancy\" places that wil have lots of regular sounding items like BLT or burger but be made with totally different ingredients.

If you like trying new twists or foods, this definitely the place for you.  It's not the place for us.  But the server was nice about the fact that I didn't like the BBQ sandwich, the sauce had too much vinegar, and brought us a free dessert."}
{"text":"The place is great in the garden.  A little walk coffee and desert.   Plus the main dishes are very interesting.   Fresh local stuff prepared in a nice tasty way.   The night I was there it was very crowded and the food could have been a little warmer and one person at our tables fish was a little dry but we all said it was a place we are coming back too.   All in all a very trend cool place with good food and interesting people."}
{"text":"Four stars for the 'garden 'rita' alone. Jalapeno tequila. Cilantro. In a margarita. That's really all I needed to see when I sat down at the gorgeous bar, in the gorgeous DBG, with a gorgeous view (get it?). 

We only stayed for a couple of quick drinks and a shared app. I'm not going to lie, please don't order those soft pretzels. They managed to taste like old beer and nothing -- at the same time."}
{"text":"Gertrude's was a wonderful unexpected surprise.  Using locally sourced ingredients and with a diverse but limited menu, it is bound to satisfy eclectic tastes.  Staff was very helpful but spread thin, and seating is limited indoors with a lot on the patio for non summer time, I suppose. But all of that is more than counterbalanced with the DELICIOUS food.  

Try the corn fritters if they still have them - they are fantastic."}
{"text":"A little bit of paradise ...food is delicious,  staff is very attentive and the view of the gardens is beautiful !!"}
{"text":"Fresh and flavorful with a pretty simple menu.  We went for dinner both ended up ordering a sandwich. I got the veggie ($12) which was packed with fresh vegetables, and some kid of wonderful cheese that brought the whole together. It was very good.  The person I went with got the chicken and bacon sandwich ($14), she said it was very good and that the bacon was cooked to perfection.  The fries were, well... fries. 
The dinner entrees were pretty pricey, they were $20-30, but it is good fresh food. 
They also have a good selection of wine and beer with local options for both, but the local options were rather pricey. 

The wait staff was friendly, attentive and helpful. They made sure we were taken care of with out being too involved which allowed us to converse and enjoy our meal. 

The atmosphere is casual but nice, makes for a great date place. From there you can go right into the garden and complete a nice trip to the garden."}
{"text":"What luck that we were all hungry while we were at the botanical gardens!  Great restaurant. Not the usual junk at tourist attractions. Really eclectic menu and everything was delicious. Full bar too and extensive beer selection."}
{"text":"The proprietor of Gertrude's contacted me directly and was amazingly accepting of the restaurant's shortcomings. She offered to have me back to try again after she puts the entire staff through a refresher course in customer service and has a staff meeting. Will keep you posted after the second go at it..."}
{"text":"For some reason, because we were at the Desert Botanical Gardens, I thought that Gertrudes would have a large assortment of tasty salads. It makes sense right? Gardens bring to mind fresh produce, spice, herbs, and other food varieties of the veggie kind.

Well thankfully, the Chihuly exhibit exploration led our group to curiously give this restaurant a try, which brought me face to face with the blue ranch burger. It was love at first sight I tell you. The hunk of high quality well cooked beef, caramelized onions, bacon, freshly sliced tomato, and I think there was some lettuce in there, all tasted wonderfully together. I was so surprised! Even the fries were really good. The fries were thick cut, and you could tell that they were deep fried most likely in special oil because they were full of flavor and took on some of that color, but when you picked up each fry, is was light and perfect in texture, not soggy or oily at all. It was highly deceiving, but relieving eating each fry. 

The calamari rings were lightly breaded and fried along with complimentary vegetables some of which included onions and peppers. It came with a cream sauce, which I think was an aioli sauce that disappeared very quickly because we enjoyed it so thoroughly between the four of us. 

Our waiter had enticed most of our party into ordering the marinated grilled chicken sandwich. It uniquely had jicama in it, but it also had the now traditional fare of guacamole in it. This is what made ordering a very tough decision for me, but even though our waiter's favorite dish is the chicken sandwich, I'm partial to my blue cheese burger!

Oh and food for thought, no pun intended, we chose to sit outside. Even though it was evening and a bit brisk and chilly outside, it was more peaceful and beautiful outside with the surrounding desert plants and trees. There were plenty of outdoor heaters to keep us comfortable so keep that in mind when you choose seating. It was a bit too noisy indoors and crowded, so it was nice to have the option to enjoy outside during the winter."}
{"text":"Beautiful space, great service and yummy food!  We went here with a large party after visiting the Botanical Gardens.  Our server, Caleb, was fantastic.  We had 5 small children and he was attentive and helpful.  The food came a little slow because they were busy bit that was the only negative.  I ordered calamari (yummy), beet salad (great to have 2 sizes avail) and the chili (hearty and tasty)!!  Would like to go back on a date with my husband (sans kids) ;)."}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day. It was awful and disappointing. Out of five of us no one liked their food."}
{"text":"First of all, this is one of the loveliest settings for a Sunday brunch you could ever hope for.  Some of the tables on the patio in the early morning are shaded by well manicured acacia (?) bushes, birds twittering, the desert surroundings beautiful. What better place to sit and dine than in the Botanical Gardens.

We made reservations on Open Table, timing it for just as they opened.  Seating was not a problem. The weather was finally mild not scorching.

Starting with drinks, Mr. B ordered the red Sangria. It came with foam on top, orange and apple slices floating in a wine concoction hinting of peach liquor. Good.

My coffee was not so great. I wished I had gone with iced tea like I saw at other tables. At least they kept my cup filled.

We started by sharing a beet and hazelnut salad.  $12. This was the one dish I would return for. A large plateful of delicious mixed greens that was artfully decorated with three colors of beets, and copious amounts of toasted hazelnuts. Lightly dressed with a sweet dressing, it was a very nice start. My only complaint was an occasional overly salted leaf, a surprise to my tastebuds. It would have been fine with no salt whatsoever. 

We chose two entrees at $12 each. The hostess had highly recommended the Hot Mess, which actually is a stack of three crispy corn tortillas, layered with a pork chile verde sauce, topped with some cotija cheese and two sunny side up eggs. While beautiful to look at, the verde sauce tasted bitter and ruined it for me. I ate the eggs (which were beautifully done) and half the tortilla stack, scraped off the meat (too spicy) and sauce, then gave up.   Mr. B liked it better than me and finished most of it...because he didn't like his own dish.

The second entrée was the Arizona Benedict. This features a chorizo on English muffin, some cooked greens, cheese, and poached eggs covered in a southwestern seasoned hollandaise sauce.  The two eggs were overcooked to the point of being hard boiled. The chorizo was bitter and the portion diminutive, and the greens, while tasty, could not save the dish. It was not something either of us would order again.

The fingerling potatoes that came with his benedict were prepared by frying then smashing and salting. While attractive to look at, they were lacking any flavor to write home about.

The menu is quite limited and changes with the seasons.  They like to feature local foods and produce.  After having read about the brussel sprout dish, and also the swine, we were both disappointed that neither were on this current summer menu. I strongly suggest you call to find out what is on their seasonal menu first, then decide to come, or not. After all is said, I think that having an American bacon and eggs meal would have suited me better.

Not impressed."}
{"text":"Would you believe me if I told you to visit Gertrude's at the Desert Botanical Garden for a taste of the best swine I've had in the Valley? Yes swine...at the Desert Botanical Garden. It doesn't quite make sense right? Well, opposites attract in this case because this swine is divine. The Chef smokes this swine to perfection and each bite is better than the last. I would have never thought walking into Gertrude's that I would be writing this review, but it's true. Get the swine.

Ok, I will go a little deeper into this review and digress about the restaurant itself and not just the swine. The patio is adorable and has a nice fountain and garden feel to it. It is the Desert Botanical Garden after all. This is a great restaurant addition to the garden and a perfect spot to dine for lunch or dinner during your visit. However, I think it should be a destination even if you aren't going to the garden, because the swine is that good. The Chef is just incredibly talented with all his food. Who would have thought! The Desert Botanical Gardens! A culinary haven!"}
{"text":"This is a must stop if you find yourself in the Phoenix area. It's connected & located to the entrance of the Phoenix Botanical Garden. You can go for dinner then floor up with a night in the gardens walking around. We got the buffalo wings appetizer and my friend got a Mexican dish-enchiladas. Both were delicious an the bar tender made us great drinks. It too was a busy night but the service was still excellent!"}
{"text":"The Escarole Salad is fun and delicious.

Briana gave me Excellent service.

Eating outside allowed me to enjoy the
Desert Botanical Garden's plants and animals."}
{"text":"It's a little spot within the Desert Botanical Gardens. You should make reservations or risk waiting a long time. 
Their menu looks delightful, unfortunately, if you don't partake in meat, you will be disappointed. Even one of the fish dishes comes with meat, which our server informed us couldn't be changed. 
My fish dish was ok. Before you gag, just know that some fish has worms in the meat, but if cooked thoroughly, it's fine. You've probably eaten hundreds of them without noticing. I did notice 2 small, dead worms in my fish, but since the fish was slightly rubbery, I assumed it was overcooked, and thus the meat was fine. That stuff doesn't bother me. 
I ordered the side of potato salad as well. I don't know why, but I'm not a big fan of the big chunk potato salad, or the al dente style...i like it a bit more soft. 
The window were open and some flies are expected, but it was a bit too much. Way too many flies landing all over the food and tables. 
Service was fine, nothing special. Prickly pear margarita was the highlight of the meal. 
Glad we tried it, but won't be repeating."}
{"text":"Outstanding service.  The cocktails don't try to be cool and different, they just are.  Cactus water.  Check.  Chia Seeds.  Check.  Charcoal.  Check.  Gertrude's is just an upscale yet laid back place to enjoy the beauty of the Sonoran desert... in a glass.

The food is quite nice as well but we haven't really eaten here much.  We drop in after strolling the garden and it's like getting away to another world, even though we're in the middle of the Phoenix metropolitan area."}
{"text":"Came to the Desert Botanical Garden to meet up with boo thang's dad, brother and his family, and wanted to have breakfast at Gertrude's before we decided to walk around the Garden. It was just about 9:15am when we arrived, asked for a table for 8, and got a little push back from the hostess (who actually may have been the supervisor, I think) well when we requested our table for 8, she said she wasn't sure if she could get us one and that we should of called the day before to request a table that size and so that they could be ready for us. Well that's offputting - maybe I would of understood more if it was a packed house at the time, but it sure as hell was not! There was one other family of 4 and a table for 2 out on the patio, that's it! There was plenty of room for us and for them to out together 2 tables!..

Ok breathe Dianne...anyway food was ok everyone seemed happy with their meals. But mine was underwhelming. I had the Breakfast Bowl, which was to be pork gumbo with eggs and a corn muffin. It was more just refried beans, a lifeless egg and a corn muffin just thrown all up in the beans. I guess I expected a bit more of a presentation.  

All in all - loved the Desert Botanical Garden, just next time, I'll eat before I get there"}
{"text":"A nice little restaurant inside Desert Botanical Garden. After taking our engagement pictures we came in for dinner and drinks. I recommend that you call and make reservations or else you will have to wait or there might be no tables available. It was a little annoying that when we walked in there were plenty of tables available but the hostess said they were busy and had no tables available. However she said we could sit at the bar and thankfully we were able to find open spots .I really enjoyed the openness of the place and the outdoor seating area looked real nice to have dinner. The menu is limited and nothing looked really enticing to try that night. We will come back to try the food and then I'll update my review!
My drink however was on point! I recommend getting the Tombstone Tea."}
{"text":"The Korean fried chicken was awful.  Tried two bites.  Gave some to a friend to see if it was just me and they agreed.  Awful and she is full blooded Korean!  Threw the whole thing away minus our 3 bites and my tastebuds wanted to go vegan after that.  Maybe others have or will like it but we surely did not!"}
{"text":"I give one star just because the service was worse!! They just give u the great service when u order drinks like beer or wine and not share the food..

Made my mood to eat even worse..I was hungry when I get into restaurant but after the service like this even have to go to the bar to get my refill..I don't feel hungry anymore..what a bad service :("}
{"text":"This restaurant is located inside the botanical garden. It was mostly brunch.

Even though we went inside there were a lot of flies there and they kept flying over the food, so one might want to bring a flyswatter before eating here.

While we were not shooing the flies away the food tasted very good and it was too filling or I didn't need to eat much.

The staff was also very nice. The prices were slightly high but someone else paid so I'm fine with it.

The reception in the building was not good so despite there being a PokéStop within reach we could not play while we ate."}
{"text":"Ok so I hate to break it to ya yelpers, but this place is really overrated.  My boyfriend and I came here on a busy weekend and waited 15 minutes for a seat (no big deal).  The place is packed full of little old ladies (which makes sense since it is in the botanical garden).  The food certainly fits it's clientele though because it could not have been more bland.

My boyfriend got the fish tacos which were tasteless.  For a taco there was not even a hint of spice. The beans were undercooked as well, but they were the only thing on our plates that was hot.  I got the chicken sandwich which really small and a small side of cold chewy fries.

The only thing that I do have to say that I really loved was my strawberry basil lemonade which was perfectly fruity and refreshing and made fresh to order.  It almost made me bump my review up to a 3 star, but that's literally the only thing I liked this spot.

The service was just okay.  With such a unique menu I would love to have a waitress who explained the more unique dishes and made some recommendations.  Our waitress didn't even tell us the soups of the day.  I'm sorry, but for the price you pay for this food you need someone to help you make good choices and even just check in on you to ask how your meal is tasting.

My last thing to note is the price.  Without any alcohol, appetizers, or desserts our meal was over 40 dollars for a bland tiny little lunch.

Unless you want to stop here for a drink after a day in the garden I say SKIP IT."}
{"text":"Went there last night for the holiday LAS NOCHES DE LAS LUMINARIAS 2016.   Good thing we had reservations; the place was packed!!

We each pondered the wine list.   I had the Red Blend, Pillsbury, \"Wild Child Red.   It was an enjoyable wine.

For dinner I had the Sonoran Style Fried Rice with the Pickled Mushrooms + Chinese Broccoli + Black Garlic Mojo + Chili Rubbed Poached Egg.   Others had the Korean Fried Chicken Thighs, the Striped Marlin, two had the Gertie Burger, and another had the Smoked Pork Pozole as well as the Roasted Veggies and the brussel sprouts.   

I don't know what they mean by pickled mushrooms, but the dish was absolutely delish!   Everything had the correct amount of flavors and textures albeit the chinese broccoli could probably have been fried a tad less.   The egg was a great touch.   

Everyone said their food was great.   I tried the roasted veggies as well as the brussel sprouts, which I believe were roasted as well.   I liked the roasted veggies, and even though I'm not that much of a fan of brussel sprouts, they were good.   I thought the chips that accompanied the burgers had waaayyyy too much salt.   It seemed as though someone accidently spilled the salt shaker.   Since they weren't my chips, I have nothing to complain about.

I would definitely go back to Gertrude's just for the food.   The setting is perfect sitting outside and the servers were very attentive, friendly, and professional."}
{"text":"I went to Sunday brunch with my parents at Gertrude's today. We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful scenery. It was little hard to find - it wasn't obvious from the signage that the restaurant was inside the Desert Botanical Garden. It was sunny and I would have liked a little more umbrella coverage so no one in our group had to worry about getting burned.

The food was a little too foo-foo for me. (Disclaimer: I have the palette of a 5 year-old so fancy food does not impress or interest me.) I had the American breakfast - poached eggs (cooked to perfection), sausage (very good), fingerling potatoes, and toast. I asked for an English muffin instead of regular bread and was a little miffed they wouldn't make that substitution. My Dad and the eggs benedict and enjoyed it. Mom had the frittata and said it was a bit oily. Our friend had the mahi tacos and really enjoyed them. 

We topped off the meal by splitting the donut holes. They were delicious. 

This probably isn't a place I'd seek out again, but I'd be open to returning if someone invited me. I think I'd like to try it at lunch instead of brunch next time."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful brunch today ( our first visit ).....A terrific place to start a weekend day....sounds of the Desert Botanical Garden ; nice people and friendly staff all combine to make any dining experience a pleasure in the Arizona tradition ! Michelle took time from her busy schedule to stop by & say hello; our waiter Mathew was most knowledgeable regarding the menu offerings. Yes. we will be back !"}
{"text":"Best eggs Benedict ever, although non - traditional. Great quiche but a puny slice. Great fritata, too. Leisurely service."}
{"text":"Fantastic gourmet restaurant. Great atmosphere with lots of natural light. Nice service. The food is beautifully served, made with quality ingredients, and it delivers multisensorial complexity and delight.
The experience comes at a price, of course, but it is worth the money. 
Recommended!"}
{"text":"This may be the best brunch ever. After walking the Botanical Garden get breakfast here! Delicious and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"A friend and I had reservations for 6:30 p.m. Saturday, 2/13/16.  Yes, it was crazy busy, due not only to Valentine's Day, but also the light show in the garden, and, according to our server, the hordes of winter visitors.  In fact, she told us that the restaurant has been packed nightly since November.  What a blessing for them.

However, how they handle it is not so wonderful.  Staff seemed frantic.  The place was so crowded, you had to dance around the staff to try move between tables. They tried to seat us literally right against another diner.  Her back was touching the table where we were supposed to sit.  My friend balked.  There were a number of 2 seat tables open in less tight spaces.  She requested and we got one...but everyone seemed horribly, rudely, and overtly put out by this.  Especially the very rude and very young (inexperienced?  incapable?) woman who was serving as the host at the front.  

Blue post it notes on the menus to indicate to the person seating us, where to seat us, our party name, and the number of people in our party.  Who does that?  I asked about the practice.  Apparently, that was supposed to be the system to get us all seated in an orderly manner.  Well, considering the back up at the host's table, the system wasn't working so well.

All that to say, we ate a fast meal.  The food was decent, but the whole environment, from lighting to crowded tables to noise level to management and servers bordering on rude, made for a less than pleasant dining experience.  We just wanted to eat and get out of there.  So we did.

This place is taking full advantage of their location at a key tourist and visitor destination.  It's a shame they don't show more appreciation for their patrons."}
{"text":"I had a lovely Sunday afternoon brunch date at Gertrude's yesterday with my husband... it had been on our list for quite some time, and for good reason.  Gertrude's is a hidden little gem at the Desert Botanical Gardens.  You can make it your destination or you can pair it with a visit to the DBG.  Either way, you're in for a treat.

We were pleasantly surprised to walk in and hear live musician Lawrence Zubia performing... he was awesome.  We waited at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged as I think we timed our visit during a shift change... We then decided to have a seat at the bar instead of waiting a bit longer for patio seating, which on a beautiful day, is definitely the way to go.  (Next time!)

The bartenders were super friendly and the menu had plenty of unique options... with ingredients sourced from local farms in AZ and around the Southwest.  We started with the cold smoked salmon \"tartare\" to share.  It was delicious; we devoured it!  From there, my husband had the B.L.T.E. and I had the veggie frittata.  I won on that order... the frittata was perfectly cooked, had plenty of flavor from the eggs, veggies and potatoes, and it was served with lightly dressed and parmesan sprinkled greens.  Despite ordering the \"E\" in his sandwich as over easy, they arrived a bit more done.  It was alright... not amazing.  He'd definitely try something different next visit.

I hear that the lemonade at Gertrude's is some of the best in the Valley, so I'll have to try that next time as well... and we'll have to bring the kids too; I was pleased to see a nice looking and decently priced kids menu!  The restaurant is located next to the DBG gift shop and has a short little trail through part of the garden.  I'm not sure if we were supposed to walk that trail without purchasing admission to the garden, but we did, and we enjoyed it.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Six of us had dinner at sunset awaiting the evening light display in the garden. Two tried the Daring Dining venison which was appetizer sized but not identified as such on the menu or by the server. One said it tasted ok but the other person disliked it. Fortunately the ham portion served to the third guy was generous enough to share! Southern chicken was deemed good; scallops were very dark outside and clear/under cooked inside; Tuna requested \"medium\" came \"rare\". Some tap beers were sold out. Those who had AZ wines liked them. Want dessert in the desert? You won't find much better than salted caramel gelato; a creative attempt to meld peach and jalapeño in a frozen custard was not nearly as exciting as it sounded. Non smiling server seemed distracted and unable to note the order without repetition. If you go for an evening meal, order a burger and brew for sustenance and enjoy the outdoor ambiance without expecting fine dining."}
{"text":"A little pricey for lunch. Green Chilli Pork is great."}
{"text":"SOOOO DISAPPOINTED TODAY!!! What a disappointment today when we had lunch at Gertrude's.  The restaurant only had people at 3 other tables and we couldn't get anyone to take our order.    All I can say is : PLEASE BRING BACK YOUR OLD MENU! We have been going to this place since they opened and had previously loved everything about it.   The 'offerings' are fewer and not so appetizing. Truly expensive for what we received.  Very strange ingredients paired together.  My husbands Tuna Sandwich left much to be desired...a pile of tuna with 2 olives on it...the toast it was served on was like a large piece of rubber.  My Hummus wrap had so many grains/seeds in it I thought it was bird food to say the least. The edges of my spinach wrap was hardened all the way around.  All of the previous wonderful pictures and comments on Yelp from other customers are no longer applicable. TOTALLY NEW MENU!  I will say :  THE FRENCH FRIES WERE FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"won't go back unless I can sit on the patio because of the loud live music, too hard to hear, to talk, not relaxing."}
{"text":"This afternoon, my parents and I came to Gertrude's for snacks and drinks. We ordered Bread, which was homemade and hard on the inside and outside. It was served with sweet tea butter with black Hawaiian sea salt. The Cream of Mushroom soup was rich and creamy and garnished with three pickled or caramelized oyster mushrooms. 

For drinks, I'd recommend the Cactus Cosmo, which consisted of house infused prickly pear vodka, blood orange liqueur, prickly pear syrup, fresh lime, and cranberry juice. It was garnished with a lime wedge. However, both the white sangria and red sangria were worth $8. Both of the sangrias were garnished with grapefruit, orange, and pear. Each glass had half a glass of wine over rocks."}
{"text":"Well, it's been two years since my original review, so I thought it was about time to stop by and see what's new at Gertrude's, and update my review.

First of all, I completely stand by my original review, which I've included below.

As I mentioned, Gertrude's is the adorable restaurant café at the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, Arizona.

Just as a note, you don't need to purchase tickets for the Desert Botanical Garden to get into Gertrude's.

Gertrude's is still charming, and it was super busy, especially for a late lunch on a Wednesday afternoon.

I found a nice spot at the bar, and the bartender/server, Jimmy, greeted me and made me feel completely welcome.

I started with the Matcha Bramble, but with vodka, instead of gin. Super Scrummy!

I tried two appetizers: poached shrimp and jicama, and the morsels cheese plate with accoutrements.

The poached shrimp was a fresh spicy salad with jicama, cucumber, watermelon chunks, feta, and roasted pumpkin seeds.

The morsels plate had a nice mixed of cheeses, brie, bleu, and a spicy cheddar, and was served with dates, pickled cauliflower, beets, carrots, cranberries. It was very, very good.

I then tried the Cactus Cosmo, which is a gorgeous drink, but a tad dry, so I had Jimmy add a bit of berry syrup, which made it perfect.

Finally, I had to try the fresh cobbler. It takes about 15 minutes to cook, so make sure to order it ahead of time, or be prepared to wait. It was definitely worth the wait. Although, it was served with a bitter lemon sorbet, which was delicious, albeit an odd choice.

During my visit, I had the chance to meet Chef Mark Bookhamer, and local gardener, Carl Seacat, of Seacat Gardens, who Phoenix New Times calls his designer vegetables \"pure art.\"

CONCLUSION 

Gertrude's is a lovely, lovely, upscale casual establishment, with consistently superb and creative selections, and a staff dedicated to fine dining service.

5/5 RECOMMEND 

***************ORIGINAL REVIEW***************
*************************************************

BACKGROUND 

Gertrude's at the Desert Botanical Garden is amazing!

Okay, let's start at the beginning...

I took my mom to the opening night of Las Noches de Las Luminarias and the Bruce Munro exhibition at the Desert Botanical Garden. 

Immediately to the right is Gertrude's restaurant. It looks cute from the outside, but it's attached to the gift shop, so I didn't know what to expect. 
I was so pleasantly surprised in every way!

The layout was very effective with the bar as the focal point and plenty of seating. The decor was charming and edgy.

THE WINE

The wine list is very interesting. Although not extensive, it's has all the current yummies that all compliment the cuisine. I was very impressed.

There are plenty of drink specials & cocktails too.

THE MENU 

The food is epic: Very creative & original. 

Gertrude's takes fresh ingredients from from artisans and farmers from around Arizona and the Southwest to make their delicious creations. 

Appetizers include:
Cheese & Charcuterie Plate
Tepary Bean \"Hummus\" (which I had - see pics)
Burrata 
Bouchot Mussels (which I had - see pics)

Salads/Soups
Burgers/Wraps

Entrées include:
Chicken Cassoulet 
Peppered Hawaiian Tuna
Niman Ranch Ham Steak
Carolina Gold Rice Grits

{"text":"I have tried this place twice now and both times the underwhelming service has overshadowed the good food. The overall experience was more ok than a-ok.

Let's start with the high points... Both times I went, my guest and I split the beet salad as an appetizer and it was delicious. The beets and greens were fresh, the goat cheese was delicious and the hazelnuts were perfectly toasted. The presentation was a layer over an oversized square plate. Little touches like the nontraditional presentation just go to show the amount of thought and heart put into the restaurant by the chef and team. For an entree I ordered the Hot Mess (chilaquiles) and my guest ordered the chicken sandwich. Both entrees had amazing flavor that didn't come from just dumping salt as other restaurants may try. Not a single negative about the chicken sandwich. The Hot Mess wasn't too hot...barely above room temperature and the layers of corn tortilla were more stale than anything. Would I order it again though? Yes in hopes that the flaws were a fluke. It was that delicious otherwise.

My second visit was for lunch and this time we got burgers. We had the Niman Ranch and Bleu Niman burgers. Both were cooked perfectly to order and did not disappoint at all. The fries that came alongside were delicious and perfectly seasoned. This time the food was all at the prefect temperature.

Now the service...ugh. Both times I made a reservation on Open Table. Fantastic that Gertrude's offers this! On the first visit (for Sunday brunch) I was told there would be a 20 minute wait when I arrived, so we opted to sit at the bar where there is open seating and we were able to sit immediately. This may have been a mistake. The service was slow and sparse. I don't blame this on poor workers, but on the amount of work that two bartenders had to do to accommodate a bar with easily 12 people sitting there for food and drink service as well as fulfilling the wine/beer/cocktail orders for the restaurant. The bartenders were so busy I almost felt like I was interrupting or disturbing them when I asked for something I needed. On the second visit (for lunch during the week) we were promptly seated with the Open Table reservation. But this time, it took a while to be greeted by our server and for drink orders to be taken. This seemed to be common at the tables around us as well. Service in general was better on the second visit, but still slow and not what one would hope for.

Paying the check wasn't a simple task either time. On the first visit, my card was charged for the wrong check, which was actually cheaper than my check. Of course I spoke up and told the bartender. He apologized and said he had to have his manager adjust the transaction. I didn't realize until a couple days later that the original transaction wasn't actually voided, but their drawer was comped. So my debit card was charged for both transactions. When I called back and spoke to a manager, she was apologetic but seemed to have no urgency in correcting the issue. She told me that it would have to wait until later in the day because I called during their lunch rush and she had to attend  to that. Hmmm...you would think this kind of problem might take a little priority. Regardless, the issue was ultimately resolved. On my second visit, I went prepared with cash. When I asked for the check, the server brought the check for the sixtop that was seated 2 tables over. I'm sensing a theme.

Overall...I'd say Gertrude's is worth a visit, but be prepared for a few hiccups along the way. Hopefully as they get on their feet things will improve."}
{"text":"Great option for a meal when checking out the botanical gardens.I loved getting to eat outside surrounded by the beautiful scenery. We also had a very friendly waiter, which always makes for a more pleasant experience.

We started with an appetizer of Bloody Mary Mussels. They were pretty good and they give you an order of fries with it to sop up the sauce. 

I ordered the chicken sandwich, which was pretty good. My stepdad got the Mahi Mahi tacos, which looked excellent. My mom had risotto, which I tasted and thought was really good but she didn't love it that much and kept adding seasonings to it to make it more to her liking. Our friend ordered the whole grain salad and seemed to enjoy it. 

We opted to try two desserts to share. The donuts and sauces and the brown butter apple tart, which had a side of caramel ice cream. I'm not big on either of these desserts normally but the donut was really good and the caramel ice cream was delicious too. I really disliked the apple tart though ( i was alone in that---the rest of the table devoured it but I couldn't take more than 1 bite)."}
{"text":"After we visited the garden my friend told me I had to try the best lemonade, so we headed off to Gertrude's, its right at the entrance/exit of the Botanical Gardens,  we were shown table on the inside but had a view of the patio outside, it was perfect. Also learned that Gertrude's was a farm to plate place, using ingredients fresh from the farms around Arizona. 

I swear I only went to try the lemonade, but I am a sucker for eggs benedict so when I saw them on the brunch menu I knew I had to try them! By the way, the berry lemonade, it's pretty amazing, even if you are someone who does not like lemons, or lemonade (like me) take my word on this, you will love it! It was lemonade, fresh herbs and fresh berries, and it was perfect and refreshing! 
Gertie's Benedicts was a visually beautiful dish, English muffin , house-made Canadian bacon, spinach, poaches eggs drizzled with hollandaise sauce served with fingerling potatoes, and this dish tasted as good as it looked! Fresh and delish!  We also ordered a bowl of fresh fruit & coconut mint syrup, this too was great tasting!

This was a great find and glad I had the chance to try them out!"}
{"text":"My sister-in-law invited me to Phoenix for a girl's getaway. As a talented amateur photographer, she's always looking for inspiring places to shoot. We arrived at the Desert Botanical Garden to do some sunset photos, but the garden closed just 30 minutes after sunset, and we weren't willing to pay full admission for less than an hour on the grounds. We decided to come back the following night for the twice-weekly flashlight tour. But while we were there, we figured we'd stop at the park restaurant, at least for a glass of wine. We were NOT expecting much from a restaurant located within a tourist attraction. Gertrude's blew our expectations out of the water!!

We were nearly the only ones there, but as we walked in, we were impressed by the offerings at the bar. We started with prosecco, as we perused the menu. Everything looked tempting, but as we are both following a Ketogenic lifestyle, we had to be careful about what we ordered. Fortunately they had several items on the menu conducive to our dietary needs, with minimal or no tweaking. I got the Grilled Pork Tenderloin, which was Keto-compliant as described. My sister-in-law got the Gertie Burger without the bun, and substituted the fingerling potatoes with a side of Brussels sprouts. They handled her special requests with aplomb. All our food was so delicious, and the service was attentive. We would come back here in a heartbeat, if we find ourselves in Phoenix again! (In fact, we stopped by the next night for a glass of Prosecco before our flashlight tour of the gardens!)"}
{"text":"I want to give this place 5 stars based on my first half dozen times I've been between 2012-2016. It was 5 stars - then. I'm from southern Louisiana, and maybe my tastebuds have remained particular about seasoning/spices since my childhood. This year, the food has declined in flavor. I think maybe based on my  smoked salmon salad today, that the kitchen is trying to be too creative. The top layer - before dressing and croutons was tasty. After that, it was too many conflicting flavors.  My friend said of  the pork dish he ordered was just ok, the pork flavorful, the sides/sauce? bland.  If I could give 2.5 stars, I would because the staff and atmosphere was excellent as usual. The drink choices - great, dessert - my blackberry sorbet rocked."}
{"text":"Out of sight!  Amazing food.  Great service and the mimosas were money.  This place is a bit hard to find as it is in the Desert Botanical Gardens.  Kinda hidden.  Something of note, the strawberry atop the mimosa literally smelled like a flower.  Freshest we've ever had!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had brunch here when we visited the botanical gardens. I got a half order of french toast, yogurt + granola + fruit, and a mimosa. The mimosa and the french toast were fabulous, the yogurt + granola + fruit weren't quite as good. Supposedly the yogurt was pear flavored and made in-house, I really wasn't a fan but my boyfriend tried it and liked it. I was expecting a dish of nice berries but instead got a whole bunch of melon with 2 measly blackberries. It's a major pet peeve of mine when restaurants advertise \"fresh fruit\" then just give you a bunch of melon (which ka cheap)."}
{"text":"A bright bloom in a beautiful garden.

Gertrude's was amazing.  My wife and I went for lunch and were pleasantly satisfied with the service, food, and the beautiful surroundings.  A tip for those who go, Gertrude's is conveniently located at the Garden Entrance.

Gertrude's offered a unique menu with many items to choose from.  We shared the pablano hummus plate that offered delicious pickled veggies to compliment the tasty hummus.  My wife enjoyed the pasta dish and I devoured half of the swine sandwich (the other half was enjoyed the following day at work).  I noticed a pork belly taco, which will be my next choice as there is no doubt we will be returning. 

I almost forgot to mention the great beer selection, tap and bottle, as well as mixed drinks or whatever you choose from a full bar.  Whether you go for a dinner date, or an afternoon lunch I am sure you will enjoy.  Thank you Gertrude's."}
{"text":"Overall, was excited to try this place out because of some
Positive reviews and the environment in the desert botanical gardens to eat Sunday brunch. Honestly, the food wasn't impressive enough for me to ever come back to again. Server was friendly and recommended the smoked pork gumbo with eggs. I wasn't impressed. It was really bland with a taste of burnt and no where near smoked. Just after taste of burnt stew with no seasoning. Not appetizing at all. I am glad we got the French toast with cactus jam to share so I would actually leave feeling somewhat satisfied. Overall, great environment, staff was friendly but food is mediocre and not worth trying out."}
{"text":"Top to bottom it's hard to beat Gertrudes.  The temp was in the high 80's, perfect for dinner in the garden.  They have built their patio to fit right into the botanical garden space.  The brussels+breakfast (not served during breakfast hours) is the perfect balance of all ingredients, brioche, egg yolk, butter, bacon and brussels in vinaigrette we had lightly fryed oyster special and the green chile pork.  Both were very tasty.  This is a destination spot and the food is worth the trip alone"}
{"text":"Love this hidden gem! BLT is amazing and Michelle the GM is amazing! Great food and great local beer selection!"}
{"text":"Tickets with friends to the concert series and made reservations.  Not impressed. The service was decent and the food was  a 5 out of 10.  Expensive for the quality or lack thereof."}
{"text":"Really amazing restaurant! The garden seating was serene and blissful. Staff was welcoming and helped with suggestions!

The food was very creative, colorful, fresh and tasty! 

I had the pork chop and melon soup and it was all yummmmmmmm!!!"}
{"text":"This is a funky / fun restaurant located inside of the Botanical Gardens. There was a bit of a wait for a table, but considering it's location, this wasn't surprising. 

Once we were seated, our waitress came over within minutes and took our drink orders. We perused the menu and made our choices pretty quickly. Everything was pretty tasty, and made the way it was ordered.

The ambiance and vibe here is what really gives it the edge. With a view of the gardens from pretty much any seat, locally sourced food / drinks, and neat decor it really has a great feel.

The dessert was the only real disappointing part of the meal. It had an odd flavor to it and I wasn't overly thrilled with it. Wouldn't order it again if we were to go back anytime soon.

Overall: A
A must-do if you go to the gardens."}
{"text":"I truly was not impressed.  We had the beet salad, mac and cheese, and sonoran dog.  The beet salad was good but nothing spectacular that I would come back for.  The mac and cheese was mediocre and the sonoran dog was okay.  We also ordered the cheesecake, which was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Hopped, skipped and jumped into this lovely little gem at the end of a Sergio Mendoza Y La Orkesta concert on March 29, fully expecting to be kicked out. Instead, we were warmly welcomed by clearly exhausted staff. We sat on the patio in the most grand weather with a view of Chihuly's yucca or whatever that tall cacti is off the main entrance/cafe patio. Perfect location. 

We had to ask for water, flatware, and napkins but it was the 11th hour, and our server, Bradley, was more than accommodating and apologetic. He listened to us whine about our disagreementss on wine, then came back with a winner for both me AND my husband. Our \"swine\" was served in a jiffy. I didnt think twice after we had consumed it about our earlier disappointment that they had sold out of the \"natural chicken\" or that the swine wasn't piping hot. 

I'd say for a 9 p.m. dinner while the cafe was shutting down, it was a charming, and quite, delicious experience. All in all, I would definitely slip onto this patio (albeit at an earlier hour). I'm sure it is then worthy of 5 stars. 

Side note: I met the owner last night at an event at the Phoenix Art Museum and she is an absolute doll. Can't wait to go back (the avocado gelato is on our bucket list)!"}
{"text":"Parsnip, asparagus, kale, melon salad w salmon; delicious!  A wonderful treat after a morning walking in the gardens."}
{"text":"Took my parents visiting from out of state. We did a late lunch to avoid the lunch rush. At 12:30 it was packed so at 2pm it had quieted down. My dad had the green chili which he said was good but it had some heat to it.  My mom wanted the pork belly tacos but they had run out of tortillas. The waitress failed to mention this at the very beginning which would have been helpful when we were looking at the menu. My mom ended up getting the hot dog that she said was very good. I had the chicken sandwich that was also very good. We also had the flourless chocolate cake that was divine!!  The gelato was also very good and tasted good with the chocolate cake. You have to order the chocolate cake when you order your food because it takes 30 minutes to make. It was a beautiful day to sit outside and the food was really good. My parents had a great day so I'm giving Gertrude's five stars!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch with my wife. I ordered the pork belly tacos and she ordered their chicken sandwich. The pork belly tacos were great- flavorful pork belly, crispy and fresh veggies, and tasty sauce with the perfect amount of cotija cheese. The service was pretty average and from the taste of my wife's food that I had, her dish was excellent as well. I won't go out of my way to come here, but next time I visit the gardens I'll be eating here again."}
{"text":"We love the botanical gardens, and we know that the proceeds that go to Gertrude's go towards the botanical gardens. But acting as if you have a fancy restaurant and actually having fancy restaurant food is not the same thing. The atmosphere was nice and the wait staff were pleasant, but the food was fancy looking and bland. My wife got the hearts of palm salad and the plantains looked tasty, but were cold and spongy. I had rice in my dish and every bite had dried bits in it. Nothing was properly salted and if you asked for salt the shaker had coarse salt that hardly let any bits fall from it. I had to put my hand underneath it and shake about 2 hundred times to see if salt was actually falling out. as I said before the wait staff is very nice and the atmosphere is very pleasant but the food is definitely not worth the price you're paying for it."}
{"text":"Service was great! Staff was super friendly, attentive, they ended up seating us inside on a cold night even though we were a large group and had previously set for patio seating. Even made me a whole new cocktail b/c I mentioned mine was a little sweet  - Amazed! As for the food, Meh. Nothing was bad, but nothing was good. The duck was tough and difficult to chew, the cassoulet was bland, oh and the steak knives were so unbelievably dull we could barely cut through the baked potato let alone the steaks. It wasn't that it was terrible, but at the price point Gertrudes is asking, there's about 50 better restaurants within a 10 mile radius. Love visiting the gardens, but will not be back to Gertrude's."}
{"text":"Ok I heard some great things about this,  nice ambience, quite so I stopped in for Brunch I think you better change your dollar signs $ to 3 $$$.  Paid $18 for 3 pieces of French Toast, which was cold, and a soda water.  Now before you poo pah this as an inexperienced diner I have traveled the world and have eaten in numerous places around the globe.  This was a joke if you wish to play high spender go for it but there are a lot of eateries in the area that produce great quality brunches for a better value........ 
Just my opinion"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Gertrude's at brunch.   Our server (Matty?) was excellent and is the reason this review is five stars.   We had spent a couple hours walking the Desert Botanical Gardens (100 degrees) and were ready for refreshments.

A place can have good food to excellent food, but service makes or breaks the experience for me.

We were there to celebrate a birthday and our group ordered:
Chicken wrap $15.00 - delicious
Breakfast bowl $12.00 - delicious
Gertrude's burger $17.00 - delicious
American breakfast $12.00- very good with the sausage

Top it off was a wonderful Happy Birthday dessert with ricotta donuts and sauces, definitely order this.

Drinks:
Garden Rita $10
Tombstone tea $8
Desert Rose $9

Thank you for making this birthday celebration so special!  We loved the food and the experience."}
{"text":"We went to Gertrude's for restaurant week, the setting is just terrific, the food was fresh & so flavorful, the only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because it's very noisy inside the restaurant & it wasn't even very busy.  The beet salad is memorable!! I will return with out of town guests... But I would sit on the patio so we can hear each other!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome outdoor setting for dining with \"sneaky access\" into gardens for those seeking to beat the system - not the typical customer here by any means!  Great wine list, surreal cactus galore, and eloquently served meals in all variations.  Watermelon radishes caught my attention swiftly as did the horseradish potatoes and gumbo.  Truly a special spot in Phoenix to chill."}
{"text":"Scenery and service five stars! But the drop in the star is for the food. Food was good but I've had better for the price point.

Arizona eggs Benedict were good. Burger meh. Drinks are on the more expensive side. Older crowd is here on Sunday. 

If you want a unique place to dine try this out. It's located to the right of admissions and you do not need a pass to get in."}
{"text":"Gertrude's is a nice restaurant in the Desert Botanical Garden. The outdoor seating seems generally more popular and my group was lucky enough to get a table for 8 at 11am on Sunday. The group after us was denied outdoor seating since it was all reserved.  Our table ordered the Gertrude's eggs Benedict, French toast, and breakfast bowl gumbo. Everything was good but not completely outstanding. The French toast was a bit too on the sweet side. The eggs Benedict and gumbo were better choices. The service overall was good and the atmosphere was relaxing."}
{"text":"My family and I had a very nice lunch at Gertrude's. We sat outside and the staff was very accommodating in setting up an umbrella just right to shade out table.

I ordered the cheeseburger, done medium well. It was cooked just perfectly - done but not overdone. It was still juicy and flavorful. I loved the dressing that was on it and the bun was fresh. The fries were also very tasty. Some have said the portions are small but that was not the case with the burger. I couldn't finish it and believe me I like to eat.

My mom got the chicken sandwich which comes with cole slaw on the burger, which I thought was unusual. But she said the chicken was cooked well and was flavorful.

Our server was very nice and attentive. My only complaint (and why I docked a star) was the hostess. There was a wait so I gave her my name. She told me it would be about 15-20 minutes and then asked for my phone number. I asked her if she would text me and she said yes. 25 minutes passed and no text. We were sitting just outside the door so I went in and she said she was waiting for me. I told her I thought she was going to text me. She said only if she could get us in early. I've NEVER had to check back at a restaurant. They always come get you! Especially since we were sitting right there! So I thought that was weird and disappointing that we sat there for more time than we needed to. I guess if I hadn't checked we'd have been sitting even longer! They need a new system. Like maybe the system that every other restaurant on the planet uses.

Anyway, I would go back because I liked the food but now I know to be wary of the hostess."}
{"text":"Recently moved here from Los Angeles and we were looking for a good place to have a good breakfast and mimosa. Our server \"jash\" was amazing!!! Good customer service and great with his manners !!! I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful location! However, save your $ on the pretzel appetizer. It was burned on the outside and raw and dense on the inside. When I asked the waiter about it, he advised, \"that's how it is\".  Save your money, go to the mall, and get a Wetzel pretzel"}
{"text":"Couldn't be happier with this pick. We went during the luminaries show at the garden, the ambiance was amazing. The food was unique and well crafted, the chicken cassoulet was homey and gourmet. The star of the show may have been the house made doughnuts with a prickly pear jam dipping sauce. Local beers on tap and a host of original libations. I will definitely frequent this place when visiting phoenix."}
{"text":"Best place we ate at during out Arizona vacation. So unexpected. The salad... amazing! The soup... amazing! Some of the best flavors I've ever had. Fresh, healthy, perfect portion size. It's a little spendy but was a lovely experience. I could have sat at the bar and sipped wine for hours."}
{"text":"What a gem! I absolutely love this restaurant!! The menu choices appeal to all age groups and tastes. The food makes your palate do a happy dance and the customer service is what you would expect in a 5 star restaurant. Gertrude's is a casual place with an upscale feel. I recommend it to everyone I know."}
{"text":"We were enjoying the Garden and decided to have lunch at Gertrude's since my husband had never eaten there.  We sat at the bar, which had a clear view of a dirty kitchen!  We also noticed the celery sticks with olives and lemons ready for Bloody Mary's that looked like they had been there for over one week.  Actually a server used one and we even commented to him how gross they looked!  He then proceeded to reach in with his hands to man handle the olives and then grabbed straws from the top and put them in the glass!  We ordered the chicken wrap and beam hummus which was one of the worst wraps and hummus we have ever eaten.  The chicken in the wrap was dry and had no flavor.  The chips looked like they were from the bottom of the grease pan and we couldn't tell what we were eating regarding the hummus as it didn't have any flavor either.  Giving it even one star is generous!"}
{"text":"Many times I preface my comments with a disclaimer that many gastronomes carve out negative reviews when they are dissatisfied in a fit of retribution, and those pleased won't spend the energy writing much, thus making many reviews somewhat slanted! I try to be even-handed, not holding back the negative, but try underscoring the positive - always my 'opinion' and those with me at the time.  Gertrude's falls into a peculiar category in my reviewing.  A restaurant that has achieved a well above average category in both foodie social media and professional critics alike place the demands of staff, management and chef to be on the ball all the time, and strive for the consistency that is appropriate to its accolades whether a main dish, soup, salad or sandwich.  That did not happen during our visit recently.  Gertrude's seems to strike me as an eatery that is trying to be a fine dining experience, without the dining experience!  Despite a reputation that under Chef Eldridge back in 2013 offered Gertrude a 3.5 of 5 on Howard Seftel's list - leaving aside his mention of and my agreeing with his \"you-got-to-be-kidding\" comment on his 'bread' issue, I agree across the board.  When you consider Yelp's 3.5 of 5, Open Table's 4 of 5, Zomato's 3.8 of 5 and Robrt Pela's tribute to new Chef Matt Taylor, we could not agree with such praises.  Upon arriving, you almost immediately are overwhelmed by the 'welcome tourist' mentality.  This is not an eatery you approach for both consistency or fine cuisine.  Ratings seem to boast extraordinary fare but they do not appear to pride themselves in giving the customer the best possible food experience, you just get the impression that the diner is there to be stiffed with exorbitant prices, for highly boasted dishes that are on par with much lower grade dining establishments - of which we have plenty in the Valley of the Sun.  This was a meal that was in no way worth bragging about for its value, originality, excellent taste, presentation or the overall dining experience.  As for the prices - you positively do not get what you pay for! Our experience with our high expectations for their Farmer's Soup was far too much cream with extraordinary blandness (salt and pepper please); the French Dip's beef was relatively tasteless, far from being tender with an undecipherable aioli and the au jus dip incredibly frail; and the Chicken Sandwich was nothing to write home about - my wife did not finish it!  Our recommendation - have a drink or two, maybe an appetizer.  If you're in a rush, they'll help you leave quickly - if you're not in a hurry, there's the Gift Shop, they won't rush you out of there! Bon appétit is not the word for Gertrude's!  Happy dining, el Gástro Ecléctico!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Try the Prickly Pear jelly! Brunch is served till 4pm so you can pick anything you would like from the menu. The deserts looked great but we were pretty full from breakfast."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Gertrudes in December.  It's a little confusing what they are trying to accomplish.  Based on the prices - average price of $35 per plate - you would think it would be a quaint restaurant with exceptional service.  Gertrude's is the exact opposite of what we expected.  They cram way too many tables into a small area, making it impossible to share a quiet meal.  More importantly, however, the staff is completely clueless about the restaurant.  They had no clue who the chef was and didn't know anything about chef's prior experience, nor were they interested in finding out. 

For the same price, there are several dozens more intimate restaurants in Phoenix and Scottsdale.  We have no interest in going back."}
{"text":"above average.

-1 for a hard-to-find location.  google was confused.  and so were we.  for clarification, the restaurant is *inside* the botanical garden.  and, no, you don't have to pay for admission as long as you're just going to the restaurant.

+1 for acommodating our reservation for a group of 7.  we sat on the back patio, and the weather was splendid.

+1 for great service.  kept our waters filled consistently.

+1 for tasty cocktails.  i can't remember which my wife had, but it was good.

+1 for a tasty \"3 Napkin Smoked Sow\" sandwich.

{"text":"Decent food, moderately okay service, but very hot. We had dinner at Gertrude's tonight and it was 89 degrees in the restaurant. Really? I suggest you close until it can be fixed."}
{"text":"This is a quaint cafe-style restaurant inside the botanical garden, a refreshing oasis after a wearying stroll through the park. I ordered their salmon salad, which I thought was an intriguing dish because it combined salmon with pork chicharon as it's key ingredients - what a surprise - the subtle fish taste of salmon neutralized with the salt crispness of pork fat, an amalgam of bursting flavors! The hospitality of the food servers was definitely an added plus"}
{"text":"Gertrude's is a hidden gem. It is a very small restaurant inside, but if not too hot the patio has plenty of seating. We were there for some drinks and Bloody Mary Mussels. The Mussels were cooked perfectly and the added Bloody Mary sauce was slurp worthy. Looking forward to returning and sampling other items from the menu."}
{"text":"Perfect for a peaceful/relaxing date night! Super cute for pictures too.

We had the spicy \"garden-rita\" and it was amazing. Started off with the \"green chile humus\" and it was so yummy with the crackers on the side! I'm vegetarian so I had the \"red chile risotto\", not horrible but personally not my favorite. I'm sure others would really enjoy this! Was missing more spice or salt. As you can tell by my food choices, I love spicy!

Service was amazing! Tuesday night was a slow night and the service was prompt, attentive and friendly. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"This was an amazing brunch spot! My mom and I each had the frittata with fresh veggies and feta cheese and a side salad! We split a side of fruit, it was huge! All super fresh! DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET A SIDE OF THE ROASTED FINGERLING POTATOES! So good! John was our server, super friendly and knowledgeable! In addition they had live music that was beautiful!"}
{"text":"Had the blackened scallops w roasted corn maque choux and Tabasco hollandaise. It was the best scallop dish I've ever had. Seriously. Their U-8 scallops were ginormous. You must get this. 
I also had some of my niece's mac and cheese (from the kids menu). Next time I plan on ordering one for myself, too. Very creamy delicious. 
Outdoor dining area is beautiful. Service was outstanding. On the pricier side but worth it."}
{"text":"Great, great location but still working out the kinks. 

As with any new restaurant, my experience was that of an establishment still trying to establish itself. Besides the longer-than-expected wait times for food and food items never arriving, what did end up in front of me was UN-BELIEVABLE! 

I'm a vegetarian with a long history of being underwhelmed by veggie sandwiches. In fact, you'll rarely catch me ordering one because of the blandness that so often accompanies the traditional \"salad-on-a-sandwich\" that is usually served to me. I decided to go against my gut and order the veggie sandwich and was so happy I did. What ended up in my belly was the most flavorful, rich sandwich I've ever tasted. It was amazing that they could cram so much flavor into this thing. It was truly amazing. 

Along with my sandwich I also ordered their Cactus Cooler adult beverage. Absolut Pears, ginger syrup and muddled serrano peppers... yes, peppers! Let me just say, that drink burned so good. 

All in all I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We are members of D.B.G. and have dined here a couple of times while visiting the Garden. Food is Ok but way over priced. Question is, does the convenience of location trump value? I prefer to drive down the hill to Mill Ave. for more choices and better value."}
{"text":"So sad.  Great location.  Pretty good food.  But service and hospitality?  Not really, when they spill your bottle of wine on you and only offer a \"so sorry.\"  Really?  When there are so many other great restaurants - and even when not, one would hope that service would mean something.  Taking my clothes to the dry cleaner tomorrow - at my expense.  Please frequent other places in Phoenix that care about customers!"}
{"text":"Great for having drinks on the outdoor patio! But the food and the service aren't really worth the $$ so we will just stick to drinks if we go again."}
{"text":"Foodies should try this restaurant. Excellent food, service, and atmosphere. The menu looked good but I wasn't totally convinced. The food ended up being EXCELLENT. Warm cauliflower salad-soooo good, the dressing was amazing. The daily veg side dish was delicious, root veg mix with some kind of vinaigrette. The greens with smoked chicken salad on the side were really good, some kind of smoky mayo to add a kick. And don't forget the non-al (!) drinks, the blackberry lemon cilantro seltzer was fresh and delicious, slightly sweet and herby. The service was great, everyone was really nice, and the setting in the garden was beautiful. Walking up to the restaurant at night was beautiful, with lights on the trees, you should walk thru the park before you eat."}
{"text":"As anyone can see, I am not a prolific nor a negative reviewer. However, this evening the experience at Gertrude's calls for exposure to the public and the business owner. Earlier this week, I made a reservation for two at 8:30 p.m. on Saturday in conjunction to the special Sonoran Lights installation in the Desert Botanical Garden. I knew of the crowds attending this special event and the great popularity from word of mouth. A reservation at 8:30 p.m. was acceptable and honestly, I expected some back-up at the restaurant. We toured the gardens and arrived at Gertrude's at 8:20 p.m. I was pleasantly surprised when the hostess informed us that they were running behind and that we might be seated 10 minutes past our reservation time. \"Can we sit at the bar and have a drink while we wait?\" I asked indicating two empty seats at the bar's front corner. \"Certainly\" I was told. As we sat, I noticed that several people were eating food at the bar and I walked back over to the hostess and emphasized that we are sitting at the bar simply to have a drink and wait, not dine. Again, I indicated and she acknowledged that we were sitting at the corner of the bar, some 8 feet at the most from the host desk.
My companion and I ordered one glass of wine and settled in to be patient. At 8:55 p.m., I walked the 8 feet (maybe 6 feet) over to the host desk to inquire for the first time as I was still in my mellow and patient frame of mind. I was told that we had been called twice. I was dumbfounded. \"How can that be? We're sitting right there. You knew that we were seated right there at the corner.\" At this point, the hostess became rude, stone-face and unresponsive. In fact, she walked away and disappeared around the corner. The host then came up, also argumentative and insistent that he had yelled out our name twice. I frankly expressed my doubt and pointed out that the hostess knew exactly where we were at the corner of the bar He then became argumentative, explaining that their system is to write check-ins on these Post-It notes on the desk and work from there. They did offer to seat us in a few minutes. At this point, I simply stated that we had lost our appetite and we were leaving. As we walked out beyond the door, I heard the host loudly proclaiming to all within earshot to \"don't worry about that guy...\".
I have eaten at Gertrude's several times prior. I do enjoy their food, although it can be hit or miss. What strikes me on this occasion is the unacceptable demeanor of both the host and the hostess...being rude and argumentative with any customer is never acceptable. Certainly, loud disdain expressed in earshot of the staff and other customers is doubly unacceptable. What I also noticed as we sat at the front corner of the bar 8 feet from the host desk was the overall dour and unhappy appearance of much of the staff. Yes, the Sonoran Light installation has been very popular. Yes, the restaurant is crowded, backed-up and in high demand. However, if the staff is as unhappy as they appear...and after many years of corporate management I have a keen eye for an unhappy and therefore unsuccessful staff delivering inferior customer experience...then something is fundamentally wrong with this restaurant.
And at these prices, no, my expectation is not that I will be bellowed at for my table as if I was at the 7th St. Denny's from some system of Post-It notes, if indeed that was the case."}
{"text":"I dined out countless times and heard about Gertrude's yet hadn't visited until this evening for restaurant week. Surprisingly, this restaurant was excellent!  The restaurant is nested inside the Desert Botanical Garden with both indoor and outdoor seating.

The chef created fabulous dishes using blended ingredients that left your palette salavating for another bite. The golden yellow beet salad accompany with fresh arugula and a light dressing was excellent. The Opa was a nice, thick cut of blackened fish served southwestern style. The dessert was a dark chocolate torte cake blended nicely with whipped cream, almonds and milk chocolate. 

I definitely was impressed and to top it off, you have to cool off with the jalapeño margarita. The best cocktail serve for $10."}
{"text":"We spent some time around the botanical gardens and decided to end the visit with some wine and an app. Of course this place was the most convenient so we checked it out.

The servers are pleasant and the atmosphere is a bit upscale but overall the place is pretty cool.

We had a couple glasses of wine with the hummus app. I would say the only downfall was that the veggies they served it with were pickled...the elements on their own were delicious but together it was a bit weird. In my mind, when you have such awesome hummus, you want  to taste that not pickled stuff.

Anyway, if we ever go back to the gardens we will go here again because the other items on the menu looked great."}
{"text":"Had a yummy lunch here after strolling around the gardens. Tried the beet salad with chicken and it was delicious! My 3 year old daughter had the hot dog and fries which she enjoyed. I really wanted to sit outside as it looked really pretty out on the patio but my daughter wanted to sit inside and she was HUNGRY so didn't want to upset her further! It was nice inside also as there is plenty of natural light and you still have views of the patio area. The staff were very helpful and friendly. We will definitely have lunch here again next time we go to the gardens."}
{"text":"First visit to Phoenix , I have to say this place as-well as their staff was amazing! They took Korean fried chicken to a different level of food they had the chicken on a bed of Brussels sprouts smothered in this magical yogurt sauce (just ask!) and delicious cocktails I ordered the rosé sangria amazing !!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey but that comes with the territory when you eat at an attraction like the zoo or in this case the botanical gardens. At least here I felt the quality of the food matched the cost. My son's burger looked like smaller version of an adult plate rather then the poor excuses most places serve kids. My BLT was awesome! I loved the addition of the fried green tomato. I also really apreciated how this place supports so many local food producers."}
{"text":"Decent food, but terrible service.  We waited nearly a half hour to get our martinis while half the table had their wine already.  The waitress didn't even notice.  The short rib was very good (not hot though) and the risotto with steak on top was the best dish of a table of 10.  Half the dinners weren't hot.  This place has so much potential surrounded by the beauty of the DBG, it's such a shame that the service is so poor.  Such a wasted opportunity that they don't have any happy hour."}
{"text":"Attended an event at the gardens and tried this place. Very different menu items and I plan on returning just to try other food on the menu. Duck was excellent and the wine list was good and reasonable."}
{"text":"Hidden gem located in the botanical garden near the Phoenix Zoo. Food was simply amazing! I tried the brussel sprouts and salad. My date had the burger and it was delish. Please try the desserts because they'll melt in your mouth. Loved the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"It could have been better!

We just enjoyed walking around and decided to head in early to our reservation. This is our second time to the establishment and it holds a lot of good memory for us. We had a date here 2 years ago and it was incredible. 

The downfall was the waitress. I wish she would crack a smile and be more professional. I'm not sure she realized the impact she makes with her poor service. For the price of the food, I would expect better service. She treated it as if she's working at a local sports bar. The food was fine so this is quite upsetting. Considering it's valentines weekend, wouldn't you want to put in some effort for big tips??

Overall, I'll be skipping this place moving forward. Overpriced and horrible service!!! 

Thanks a lot for ruining my good memory at Gertrude."}
{"text":"Gertrude's was packed tonight! I am glad I had a reservation because I doubt we would have been able to be seated as a walk-in since so many people had attended the luminaria event this evening.

We were seated promptly. The menu had all sorts of appetizing items with a wide range of proteins and a few vegetarian options. I had the venison and tried some of the Korean fried chicken. The venison was superb, full of flavor and I loved the slight kick of spiciness from the ancho chile rub. It was cooked perfectly at medium rare, and very tender. It was served with roasted potatoes, creamed greens, and a date puree. The roasted potatoes were perfect, and while I enjoyed the taste of the creamed greens they were served in a rectangular brick form so it made me think they had served me a frozen box of spinach on a plate. The date puree had good flavor but I didn't like the grainy texture of it. The presentation was unique. It reminded me a little of the mountains along Papago Peak. I also tried some of the Korean fried chicken which had a wonderfully crispy skin and tender meat. There were some pieces that were slightly over seasoned though and a bit too salty for my tastes though.

Service was good and we were checked up on as needed.

We finished our meal with a lovely panna cotta with berry sauce and diced dragonfruit. I loved the creamy panna cotta with the texture of the dragon fruit and tangy addition of berry sauce. The orange peel on top was a good way to make the presentation look better, but the actual taste of it was tough and leathery. If it had more of a candied flavor it would have perfected the dessert.

Overall it was a fine meal and a good way to spend our evening in conjunction with the luminarias event."}
{"text":"The Desert Botanical Garden is beautiful, therefore, the location and ambiance of Gertrude's is wonderful.  I went there for dinner and wouldn't hurry back.  The service was slow and the food was only ok."}
{"text":"Took my friend here for his 21st birthday dinner and had an amazing time. The atmosphere is amazing, and the weather was perfect for an evening outside. The food was delicious, and presented well. Ordered a bottle of wine, and our waiter was very good about making sure our glasses were always full. The best part about this meal was the service. We arrived at around 7:45pm which was pretty late as it was a Tuesday and they close at 9. Our waiter did not make us feel rushed or like he was in any kind of hurry to leave which I appreciated. Also did a fantastic job of making sure we did had everything we needed. Overall will come back here again to try more things on their menu."}
{"text":"Arugula salad, Gertrude Burger, ricotta donut holes, pulled pork sandwich etc was all wonderful. Our server Mary was so sharp and knowledgeable. 

The gardens are amazing capped off by a superb lunch."}
{"text":"We eat at Gertrude's 3-5 times a year, and include them in special evenings at the DBG Luminaries or concerts.   This year the food and service was a huge disappointment.  The server did not know wines or have the ability to describe the menu changes, he didn't even seem interested to be there.   The plate presentation was not great, as in the past.   My latest review is 3 stars and we will cancel our next reservation we have in a few weeks, will eat elsewhere before arriving at DBG.   Will try again in a few months, but not have the previous high expectations.  We support our DBG and we really want Gertrude's to be part of that experience!"}
{"text":"My husband & I happened upon this spot on an adventure to research landscaping for our yard at the Botanical Garden ...it was lunch time (kids in school) so we decided to sit down at the bar & have a bite & some adult time...bartender seemed knowledgable & friendly...(bald guy:0)) we had a martini & the smoked salmon tartar....Loved it!!!  We were so excited to have found a place to go for a wonderful bite & a walk around the Botanical Gardens (which is quite a nice way to spend a free day) ...move ahead 4 months...we bring my parents (visiting from Vermont) to experience this wonderful place & see the beautiful gardens...lunch was average, definitely far less than we expected...the mussels were too busy,  mussels speak for themselves, they didn't need all the ham...Chili was average & sadly the BLT was less than impressive & finally the red wine was very warm... we chalked it up to just bad luck...forward to February & we were determined to find that same experience that caplivated us when we had the tartar... & we decided to venture out again (with the kiddos) and see the lights at night at the Botanical Gardens ...we had to make reservations & that took my husband several days because, believe it or not there was no answer on Wednesday, called on Thursday & after a few trys was finally able to get a reservation on the patio...they must be booked because there was VERY limited space available, seemed strange that most dining room tables were open when we arrived at 7:00...beautiful patio spot...server was exceptionally sweet.
..we thought we were in good hands but that quickly changed...our drinks took quite a while, ok, we can get over that...we selected our entrees & wanted to start with that fabulous salmon tartar...we wanted to order a bottle of wine but our entrees arrived...she didn't space out our appetizer of smoked salmon & said it was  a  mistake & was  being served with our main course, we declined the appetizer (total Bogart, we wanted the salmon with our martinis)...we ordered a GLASS of wine each but that didn't arrive until we were half way done with a disappointing meal...tuna was Medium although ordered xtra rare...the Duck tasted like a tough turkey thigh with no flavor...& the $17 burger was only adequate... the worst part was that no one seemed to care, we voiced our opinion to the server & had to request a manager, he didn't seem happy about our displeasure & said he was sending out desserts, we didn't want dessert, we wanted a good dinner, he walked away saying he would take care of it...we waited quite a while not knowing what was being done & my husband finally went to the host stand to resolve the issue...enough said, they took care of the meal we DID NOT enjoy & at the request of my husband gave us a certificate for dinner for 2 so that we could return...that may seem great but we wanted to enjoy & pay for THAT dinner..we have a yearly membership so we'll be coming here a lot but unfortunaty we will have to dine elsewhere...such a wonder place as the Botanical Gardens should have a much better restaurant to represent them...these people need to learn about customer service & the dining experience...food on a plate does not make an evening,...I gave the 2 stars for the beautiful outdoor seating!  Try the smoked salmon tartar!




..."}
{"text":"Went there last night for the LAS NOCHES DE LAS LUMINARIAS (all be it a few days after Christmas). Both my wife and I really enjoyed everything. I had the Sonoran Fried Rice with poached egg, and added the Curry Fried Tofu.....really wonderful. My wife had the smoke salmon and some vegetables along with a side of bread and Brussel sprouts. Also very good."}
{"text":"Sat for twenty minutes before someone arrived at the table. Service very slow. Meal arrived having sat under a heat lamp. Steak ordered medium rare was now dry and well done. Eggs were dead. Wine list had nice selection."}
{"text":"Truth be told, we were so hungry when we got here that it scarcely mattered what we put into our mouths, but this is a great restaurant! 

We were happy to sit outside; it was a bit chilly for me but it was so beautiful I didn't mind. Service was fast and friendly. We managed to find a fairly high protein, low carb option, and both ordered steak and eggs, which came out perfectly cooked to order. The steak was a lovely little piece of meat, excellently seasoned and plated. It came a with a surprising but beautifully complementary sauce, the name of which I forget, made of bell peppers, and some good fries. The fries were kind of cold, unfortunately, but I don't know if that's because of the ambient air temperature.

We had to ask for salt and pepper, which wasn't on the table."}
{"text":"The hostess at the front was brash and rude. Very quick witted and seemed frustrated even at us checking in for our reservations. Definitely an attitude there. The wait staff was definitely much more friendly. 

The food took a long time to bring out. We were surprised at how small the portions were given the prices. I ordered a $25 king salmon and it looked like it had to be a really small square piece (maybe 3 oz or at least it looked like that). The taste? Just meh. 

I had also shared with my girlfriend a fish taco plate. I thought the fish was ok but again, an expensive dish for what it was for... 2 or 3 tacos with barely anything in it... We had a group with us who had the french toast and the hot mess. No one was impressed. It was all just a typical meh-fest. The only reason why we thought it was a good idea was that it was next to the Botanical Gardens. 

This place tries hard to impress but in the end, it was just disappointing."}
{"text":"The staff is wonderful, kind, attentive, and knows their stuff about the menu. Unfortunately the menu didn't have very many choices and some things on there I had never even heard of. The restaurant was clean and the decor was pretty. My only complaint is that the menu needs more options of more simple items. I'm not sure what a child would eat if a family went there, because of very strange selections. But if you like over complicated menus with ingredients you've never heard of and dishes that sound less than appetizing then definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Great location in the botanical garden. Saw someone order the Arizona Benedict and was sold. It was tasty and the chorizo made the dish. However was a little sloppy looking compared to what I saw my neighbor get. My friend ordered the same thing and one of her eggs was over cooked. I would come back though to try the dinner."}
{"text":"We ate inside as it was too hot to be outdoors.  The outdoor dining area is probably the most beautiful in the area, but needless to say, you cannot be out there at this time of year.

 Inside is pretty ordinary, but I understand this as they do a big lunch crowd when the weather gets better.  The place was only about a quarter full which is very sad, as I'll bet the boring chain restaurants were busy.  I don't get the values here, people would rather go to the Cheesecake Factory and eat the same manufacured crap they can get in Des Moines or Cleveland, rather than go to an independent place with genuine local food.  

The food here really is really very very good.  Some dishes need a tad bit of work, but this is probably the closest to farm to table the area has.  The waiter was much better than the last visit as well.

My only complaint is the menu is hard to read.  The font is small and the print is so light you need a searchlight to read it if you are over 40.  Luckily the waiter gave me a small flashlight,,,

I sure hope this place picks up customers as the weather gets better.  It would be a crime to lose it."}
{"text":"The only positive of this restaurant was the beautiful setting within the botanical gardens. We dined here for #restaurantweek and were thoroughly disappointed in the cuisine and service. Our server was cold, impersonal and borderline rude. We decided to try the prefix meal anyways. I myself ordered the black bean soup which was not only off in texture but flavor as well. It was as if it was pureed beans served as is. Odd and left a lingering taste that was not pleasant. My friend ordered the orange scented cauliflower and it was extremely lackluster. Bland and undercooked. For the next course i tried the fried chicken and Brussels sprouts. The chicken was dry and tough which is odd for being a thigh. It left an strange aftertaste that could have made someone cringe. None of the sauces were anything but ordinary and disappointing. My friend had the mushroom bolognese. This was the worst dish of them all. She describes it as sauce being frozen then cooked then frozen then cooked again. We couldn't put our finger on the after taste but it was extremely unpleasant. We both ordered the flourless chocolate tort because hey, everyone loves chocolate and at this point this had to be the best dish. Wrong again. It was very bitter and it lingered. Sad to mess up something so simple. The presentation was beautiful with all of the dishes but the meal fell so short that it is unfortunate for what potentially could be a wonderful place. I left wondering why I chose to come here and disappointed to say the least. As my friend so kindly put it, not even worthy to serve the dog."}
{"text":"I regrettably have to say that Gertrude's was underwhelming.  My boyfriend and I were at the Botanical Gardens for a Saturday wine-tasting event and decided to eat here beforehand.  The service was good, and the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  I'd read an article that talked about their Sonoran Dog (a fancy hotdog) and said it was something that you had to eat when in Phoenix.  I disagree.  I was expecting the best hot dog ever, and what I got was something that mostly tasted like the thick bun.  There's so much stuff on it, that the toppings fall off when you try to take a bite, and then the bun is so thick that it overpowers the meat.  When I took a bite of just the dog, it was delicious.  So, I guess I wish that they had a more toned down dog on the menu or that they rethought the bun.  We also ordered the mac and cheese  because I'd overhead someone at the bar remark that it was some of the best that he'd ever had...but I'm not entirely sure that it wasn't the bartender who made that remark.  It was basic mac and cheese with breadcrumbs, and it tasted pretty basic.  There was nothing special about it.  And it was an appetizer portion for $9.  That was the other thing I didn't love about this place--the cost.  We paid $30 before tip for a hot dog, a mac and cheese appetizer, and 2 non-alcoholic drinks.  If the food was better, I would be happy with that price, but, in this case, not so much.  Would I go back if someone else was paying for it?  Sure.  But, on my own dime, next time I'll try to eat before I head to the Gardens."}
{"text":"Went back with a friend yesterday.  The smoked swine sandwich was seriously incredible.  Sit outside if the weather permits.  With the gorgeous view and delicious food, it's a special treat. :)"}
{"text":"Service is excellent and the ambience outstanding We sat outside and had hummus (so-so) and amazing cauliflower appetizers Daughter enjoyed bean soup and mushroom bolognese. Granddaughters and I had the sirloin cooked to perfection"}
{"text":"The Munro light display was amazing so our party of 6 made reservations.  The salmon and caviar appetizer was really good.  Things went downhill from there.  We watched as multiple tables that were seated after us were served.  When I asked our server, Lisa, about our food she responded, \"you have to understand that a lot of these tables were seated at the same time, we are very busy\".  Wrong!  At least three tables were seated after us and served before we were.  When our food arrived the two burgers were cold.  One in our party sent it back to be heated.  My scallops were delicious, but the corn under them was cold.  Could it be that our food sat for a while?  The guy that came by the table asked if all was well and took the burger to be heated.  When Lisa found out we sent it back, she couldn't believe \"them\".  The gumbo was good, the grits were \"different\".  My salad was dry, never saw bread.  For the prices, the service was totally unacceptable. The setting was very nice, but...."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is fantastic, the drink lists are extensive and the food is spot on every time. Oh - and the scenery and ambiance is amazing! We've only been here about a dozen times and we finally got a membership to the gardens to visit after our brunch."}
{"text":"Thinking about going here for a before-show dinner some evening?  You might want to think again.  Gertrude's is set up as a fine dining restaurant but it falls short in lots of ways.

First: ambiance -- Gertrude's is located near the entrance to the Desert Botanical Garden in an area that used to be part of the gift shop.  It still looks like an empty retail space with tables and chairs arranged in rows.  Besides having the warmth of a high school cafeteria, Gertrude's is incredibly noisy.  Strike one.
Note: There is also a more inviting outside dining area if the weather is cool enough.  

Second: service -- the kitchen is way too slow.  We arrived almost an hour and a half before our show time to find a 1/3-filled restaurant.  Our server asked if we had to get out in time for a show and we told her.  Thirty minutes later our appetizers arrived.  Thirty-five minutes after that I was ready to walk out because there was scarcely time left to eat before our show.  Our server kept telling us just a few more minutes.  In the end we got our main courses barely in time to eat them, and certainly with no time for dessert.  Strike two.

Third: food - spotty.  For example, the pork trio had delicious thinly-sliced leg, but the sausage was blank and the pork loin dried out.  The short ribs were blah.  The burrata appetiser was very small for the price, and the bread (you need to order it separately for about $6) was a berry loaf of some kind that didn't work well with anything else we ordered.  That's right - no free bread.  Strike three.

Good points:  The price was halfway reasonable for fine dining.  Too bad this wasn't fine dining, which is after all about a total experience and not just the food.  A couple of the items we were served were very tasty.  The Desert Botanical Garden itself is fabulous.  That's about it.  Sorry."}
{"text":"What an amazing new addition to one of Phoenix's already amazing offerings (DBG).

I was lucky enough to partake in the \"soft\" opening this week at Gertrude's (opening officially tomorrow). 

First glance the decore is very nice, minimalist, and works very well with the rest of DBG. Sound is absorbed very well, so what looks like would be a very loud restaurant is actually very pleasant. Then when you look further you get a little peak into the kitchen from the dining room and you can see the awesome room they have for the \"Chef's table\". They even have a very large patio, which I didn't notice 'til our way out, as it was freezing (well for Phx anyway) outside and I wanted nothing to do with the outside that evening. It looks to have seating for upwards of 50 and has great views. Happy hour on the patio anyone?!

Being our first time we wanted to make sure to try everything we could:

Lamb Stuffed Ravioli - delish! the beans were a bit on the tough side, but might just not be my taste. 

Breakfast & Brussels - my favorite thing all night. I love brussels sprouts and the preparation of this dish is excellent. Brioch toast with an egg int he middle and a brussels with bacon and caramelized onions salad, i cant wait to have more!

Grain salad - quinoawith micro greens and a maple lemon vin dressing. Very tasty, my dad who doesn't like quinoa love it. 

Braised veggie - Swiss chard with a goat cheese creme, very well done

Fingerling Potatoes - triple fried, needed a tad extra salt, but you cant go wrong with these. 

Entree
Swine - basically pork four ways. I am not a huge pork fan, but all four ways were yummy! Their house made sausage was the best, tons of flavor!

Snapper - I have never had snapper before, but it was a yummy light white fish, served with Swiss chard, fingerlings and pancetta, very tasty!

Red Chili Short Ribs - my favorit presentation plate of the night, smoky, tender and delish, I will probably get these next time I am in for dinner. 

Dessert
Milk & cookies - adorable idea, excellent chocolate milk and three different types of cookies, my dad plate was clean when we were ready to eave so I think he liked it. 

Dough nuts + Sauce - my choice, very good, warm dough nut holes with three dipping sauces. I wanted the chocolate souffle but it takes 30 minutes to make, so remember to order it early.

Everything was great and we had a wonderful time.

Note: to get there park by the gardens entrance, go through main gate and you will see the restaurant on the right hand side as you walk in. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Gertrude's is a lovely restaurant at the entrance of the Desert Botanical Gardens. You don't need a DBG ticket to visit Gertrude's. 

There's inside and outside seating, and a great bar area. The outside seating is nestled among various beautiful desert flora and cacti--a beautiful place to enjoy a bite when the weather is nice. 

Gertrude's has a nice brunch menu and light lunch items. The Gertrude burger is tasty with a fabulous grilled taste, and the hummus is delicious! I like their Berry Lemonade--they have a few great cocktail-like drinks with no alcohol.. 

I've been here with a couple friends, and with a group of colleagues from work. They can accommodate small groups pretty well. 

Enjoy Gertrude's before or after a walk in the fabulous DBG!"}
{"text":"I've long been a fan of the Desert Botanical Gardens with it's Breathtaking views of the Papago Buttes. Ric Tip ~ Catch a Monsoon Sunset!

Now for Gertrude's

The DBG has worked for years to get a full service restaurant on the property and have finally Nailed It!
 
The restaurant is a large open space with a sliding wall that opens to the patio and encased with ceiling high windows that offer views to indoor diners.

Gertrude's offers Farm to Table Ingredients. A huge undertaking by a restaurant that is going to feed the masses during the Chihuly Exhibit! Yet on a recent visit to the Farmer's Market I ran into the chef loading out copious amounts of local produce before heading to the restaurant. 

The menu ranges from OMG I have to have it, to items even my Aunt Liz can look at and have little or no questions about or order without modification. Like the Niman Ranch Burger prepared the way it's described and Med Rare!"}
{"text":"This place has potential but is falling short.  I had the flat iron steak which according to the menu comes with mixed vegetables.  GF had Scallops which came with the cajun corn.  Also ordered a side of Cajun corn.  The Cajun corn side was plentiful and delicious.  Good thing we ordered it as the vegetables and corn with the entrees were used as a garnish, a streak of Cajun corn under the scallops and a tossing of vegetables on top of the steak.  Both the scallops and the steaks were done well.  My vegetables were roasted to the point of being black, I mistook an asparagus spear for a baby carrot since they were all the same black overdone mess.  Waiter not friendly but got the job done.  We noted that 80% of the tables were getting the hamburgers.  It could be that this is their specialty?  Or was it the pricing?  Hamburger prices looked reasonable about $15 while our upscale entrees were in the $30 range.   If the hamburgers are their forte then they should try re-branding to get reviewed on what they do best.  Definite issue with flies, this might be better in the summer when closed up to keep the heat out.  I may try this again on another DBG visit but will stick to the hamburger."}
{"text":"\"Last of the Summer Wine\" -  for anyone who isn't a British comedy fan - this comedy provides the audience with an escape and a relaxed stroll through the green rolling hills near a small English village. Time feels endless; a day never seems to end; and stress just melts away. 

That is the afternoon I just spent with friends at Gertrude's. But I wasn't in the rolling hills of Britain. I was at the Desert Botanical Gardens and the new restaurant named Gertrude's. I was completely relaxed. There was no rush. My stress had melted with every sip of the Gardenrita (their featured margarita). I felt quiet and peaceful. I was happy just being where I was. 

We ordered off the Interlude Menu. After a slow \"light lunch\" of grilled pizza, smothered fries, beet salad, and, of course, the Gardenrita, we were ready for a quiet stroll through the gardens . . . but, wait, perhaps a few more minutes on the patio . . . a cup of coffee would be nice and some ricotta donut holes, with warm hot fudge, lemon curd and strawberry jam, yes, that would be in order. I am a strong believer that you should always finish a \"light lunch\" with something sweet and a great cup of coffee. We did.

What a great way to spend what was probably one of the last cool, breezy days of spring. In the mid-70s. Just enough warm mid-afternoon sun to warm the freckles on my bare arms. Just enough sweet and coffee to warm the cockles of my heart. Our afternoon lunch Interlude was exquisite . . . it was the last of the perfect Spring weather on a patio made for relaxing."}
{"text":"A nice little brunch/lunch spot inside the botanical garden. 

The weather was pleasant so we sat outdoors under an umbrella for brunch. The veggie frittata was good and had a healthy helping of filling but tasted like a flattened omelette...so nothing so unique. The side salad was fresh and not overdressed. The French toast was hearty and filled with ingredients and not too sweet. The veggie wrap was okay but probably too many greens and not enough other fillings. But the homemade chips were crispy and great. 

Service was nice and they had a musician playing the guitar. Overall a pleasant experience! Then you can walk around the botanical garden to walk off the food."}
{"text":"Stopped by Gertrudes to see the Dueling Pianos and they were great as always ...
Ate the French Dip and had some Jalepeno Creamed Corn  ... SOOOO GOOD!!!
Staff as always was very friendly and professional  including a table touch by the GM.
Over all it was a fantastic evening  :-)"}
{"text":"Had a nice breakfast at Gertrude's before checking out the Chihuly exhibit at the botanical garden. My traveling companion and I like to check out the botanical gardens in the cities we visit, and it was nice to have a breakfast option right there on site.

We both had the breakfast sammies, which were good, despite the fact that I don't think anything should be called a 'sammie.' The coffee was strong, and my only complaint was that it didn't get filled very often.

We were able to eat on the patio, which was nice since we were visiting the area partially to get away from the cold. It was very comfortable and pretty."}
{"text":"We have been to Gertrude's for lunch several times since moving to Phoenix a year ago and have always been impressed with the food.  Since my son was visiting for his birthday we thought we would try them out for dinner and then do the botanical gardens luminaries tour after our meal.  Sadly, dinner was a disappointment.  The food was just so-so.  My husband had the scallops, my son had the Korean chicken, and I had the mushroom Bolognese.  The scallops seemed undercooked and there were only 3.  The Korean chicken was overcooked which made it chewy, and the mushroom Bolognese was very unexciting and had some weird crunchy bits in the sauce that added nothing to the dish.  Two thumbs down on Gertrude's as a dinner destiny, but will keep it on our lunchtime list."}
{"text":"First time here.  Disappointed with the overall 2017 Easter brunch.  Loved the bloody Mary's.  The tiny pea tart came out cool and was obviously prepped and just reheated.  Lamb was tasty and the sides were okay.  Steelhead was very tasty.  Potatoes and green beans were lovely.  

One major problem was the BLT.  The strange relish spread the not so fresh bun was not appreciated.  The what we ordered as an over easy egg was cold and the bacon was cold as well.  Tomato was not special.  Just a large one sliced.  Not hot house or special.  Butter lettuce?  The whole thing was dry and not special.  

The French toast was also dry and not special.  Seemed like banana bread, which was nice but the prickly pear or agave syrup was too sweet.  

The agave or cactus syrup seemed just used in too many foods and drinks.  Overdone.

We didn't try dessert because we thought it, too was probably prepped and not special.

Service was fine.  Everyone was friendly.

It seems like they like to feature AZ desert items but it is just overdone.  We grew up here so it just doesn't seem necessary for us to have incorporated desert items in almost every dish/drink.  Seems like it's made to impress out of towners."}
{"text":"I always come here for a great meal and service when in town. Great atmosphere sitting outside in the garden, just a beautiful setting day or night."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I dined here for dinner after viewing the beautiful Luminaries at the Botanical Gardens.  We started with drinks from the bar and the bartender was friendly.  The wine and drink menu was extensive-- the wine was excellent.  Then we all sat down and ordered different things and everyone loved what we ordered.  I ordered the chicken with the bread pudding and it was phenomenal! I ate everything.  Of course we worked up an appetite walking around the garden, so we got sucked into ordering desert (because why not--the extra calories seem negligible compared to the amount of calories we consumed in booze and food over the holiday ... and it was not New Years resolution time yet!!).  HAHA. I got the ice-cream with smoked chocolate with a signature snicker doodle and it was to die for! The waitress was SO NICE and friendly!  Apparently the meat and bread is all ordered from local places. Great food and drinks."}
{"text":"If you're going to the Desert Botanical Garden, you will want to spend a lot of time (especially if you want to see it in daylight as well as seeing the Chihuly glass after dark)....and you will get hungry!   Gertrude's is an excellent, full-service restaurant on the grounds, but if you want to get in at dinnertime, you will need to MAKE RESERVATIONS EARLY!!!  We found out the hard way, but the alternative was really nice as well.  We got their box lunches for our dinner.  They weren't cheap ($32.50 for two), but each of us had a delicious and complete meal for that price.  Each box contained a BIG wrap (mine vegetarian), a container of cole slaw (I think there were other choices for side dish), an apple, and a drink.  We ate them on their patio outside on picnic tables.  (Not in the restaurant's outdoor serving area.)"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! the food is to die for and the wait staff is phenomenal. It's so rare these days to see people that actually like and enjoy their job and you can tell the people there definitely do. We had Matthew as our waiter and the zest and vigor that he used to describe the menu was amazing. Not to mention he was an overall amazing server. My friend had his family in from Australia and Matthew was quick to explain different parts of the menu to them along with making sure that they enjoyed what they had ordered. When the food arrived it looked beyond amazing and tasted even better! I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to experience amazing food and an amazing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was terrible. Broccoli was not cooked.  cheese was liquid soup rather than crusty over broccoli 

Baked potato served cold, no butter, minimal sour cream. Had to ask to reheat and put butter AND STILL WASNT ABLE TO GET IT RIGHT!!!

HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT AS LAST YEAR FOOD WAS GREAT!! Won't be going back and will not recommend"}
{"text":"Great ambience both inside and outside. We asked to be seated outside in late November because the weather was perfect. Drink and food choices are great. Service is A Plus!  The fry bread dish is recommended."}
{"text":"because of celiac disease, i generally can't just walk into a place and hope to eat a safe meal. i have to call ahead of time and ask questions and get a feel for the place. i tried calling Gertrude's three times in two days, and couldn't get anyone to answer the phone or call me back. (it's been over a week by the way, and no one's called me back.) 

but since we were going to the botanical gardens anyway, we figured we'd pop in and ask about the menu. the host was very kind and full of all the right answers. apparently the owner(s) child(ren) have celiac and/or wheat allergy and the kitchen is designed to be safe for people with celiac and wheat allergy, even though they also serve gluten. we decided to sit down and have a meal there. the server was equally amazing, and very good about reassuring me that the chefs take great care to prepare glutenfree food for those who need it.

the vegan options are sorely lacking-- my partner and i split the hummus plate and quinoa tabouleh (our only two options), and both were delicious. the tabouleh had onions (sadface) and was a very small portion on a very large plate, but the hummus plate was enormous and delicious. (the blanched curry cauliflower was a fantastic touch!) i'm really glad we stopped in to eat there.

they were so freaking careful with our food, that the most stressful part of the meal had nothing to do with the restaurant or servers at all-- it was that my parents were incapable of getting through a meal without ordering a giant hunk of bread, and i was really really worried that they'd be spitting or blowing crumbs onto my food. (the bread, by the way, smelled so delicious, i almost cried. but again, not the restaurant's fault.)

i look forward to eating here during las noches de las luminarias, too. if you're reading this, Gertrude's, please consider making a gf vegan soup and keeping the hummus plate on the menu for awhile. :)"}
{"text":"Unexpected Perfection
Had a class at the Botanical garden and decided to have a bite before.  Beautiful restaurant with a lovely view of the garden.  Service was friendly, helpful, and perfectly times.  Wine list interesting and extensive.  The mussels are not to be missed and the scallops were so perfectly cooked I have no idea how they did it!  Strongly recommend making this a go-to spot."}
{"text":"Loved our meal here. The only negative thing I have to say is that I was almost too stuffed to order dessert.....but of course, did anyway.

The place: crowded on a Saturday at 1:30pm, but with reservations, we were seated immediately. Service was great - attentive and enthusiastic. While there were a lot of people dining, I was glad that our table wasn't on top of another table. 

The taste: bison carpaccio - a little heat, but not something you find everywhere. delicious. We also had their green chilies pork, and their veggie sandwich. Maybe we enjoyed these more after being out of the country for a week, as we were just in Phoenix on a layover, but I don't think so. Dessert was 5 toasty donut holes, with chocolate sauce, salted caramel, and lime curd. All three delicious. I wish I could have licked the plate. Also, the basil berry lemonade.....yum.

My face: Not a cheap place - our lunch set us back about $60, but what a great way to start a trip to the beautiful botanical gardens.

If we ever have a layover in Phoenix again....I'd be very tempted to go back."}
{"text":"Decided to take my parents to Gertrude's for New Year's brunch (we'd had such a good brunch last time we were here). 

Well when we got seated we found out they were not doing brunch! It's NY's Day...who isn't doing brunch?? Gertrude's is treating NY day like it's a normal Monday...no brunch, no live entertainment, etc.

We were totally disappointed but decided to try lunch. I hate to say this but it was a total bust. Duck enchiladas were flavorless, hamburger was cold, drinks were too sweet...

Our waiter acted like he was so busy that we were kind of a pain. 

The last 2 times we were here on a weekend. Service was fabulous, brunch was great, food was warm, great live music, etc. So I guess in the end, it's great on the weekends - not good on week days."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Botanical Gardens. I had already had lunch but it was lacking so I ordered a cup of the cream of celery and fennel soup. It was delicious. The soup was the best food I had eaten since arriving in Phoenix 3 days prior. My husband ordered a bowl of soup and the BLT. He enjoyed his sandwich and he agreed wit me about the soup. I ordered a mojito and it was satisfactory. My husband had a Bloody Mary, the bartender warned it was spicy and he could cut it a bit but my husband decided to try it as is. A perfect choice! The Bloody Mary was tasty but not over done. We wish we had time to enjoy dinner during this stay. Next time we come we make time to eat dinner."}
{"text":"It was a good break from the heat. I ordered two eggs sunny side up. Asked for it to be cooked with as little oil/butter as possible. 

They get four stars because it was too greasy for me. The waiter was very nice. He saw how overheated I was, he walked over to my table with iced water and a big smile. Left me alone for a few minutes to catch my breath. 

Great service. Good food."}
{"text":"We have visited Gertrude's in the past and enjoyed it completely. Today, however, will be our last visit. We were quite surprised when we called for a reservation on Fathers Day brunch that it was completely open.  When we got there, there were only a few customers. We quickly found out why..the service was just awful and the food was tasteless. I'm so disappointed as I was a huge fan of their banana bread French toast, which by the way they removed from the menu. I understand that menus change all the time, however usually for the better. The service was the deciding factor, just horrendous.  Very sad day!"}
{"text":"\"I once had two ducks when I was a kid.  One was named Gertrude\"
Thankfully, my duck was never served at Gertrude's, although I hear they make a tasty duck enchilada.

Personally, I went with the Bison Tenderloin accompanied by a duo of yucca croquettes.  It exceeded my expectations, and at $36, I would order it again... even though the accompanying steak sauce was fashioned with Huitlacoche (wheat-a-la-coochie), who's street name is \"Corn Smut\".  You can look it up for the gory details.

The entree was indeed wonderful, although the Green Chile Hummus, Stuffed Frybread, and Smoked & Fried Tofu appetizers left me under-whelmed.  I'm a lightweight, and the Peach Cobbler cocktail was a little strong for this teetotaler.  I'll stick with my pineapple vodka.

For dessert I went with the Pichuberry cobbler... wouldnt do it again, and I wasnt a fan of the coconut ice cream it showed up with.  The Ricotta Donut Holes were delightful, but I think the Best In Show had to go to the Goat Cheese Personal Cheesecake.  Great presentation!

All in all, I'd return... sans Gertrude"}
{"text":"I've had lunch here and it was very good.

I came early for a show and decided to try dinner.
Blackened scallops with corn roulade- or something like that!

My God they were tender. And just the right light spicy. The sauces were amazing, and the corn- which I wasn't really expecting much was an absolutely perfect match!

This was as good as Kai. This was great for 35.00
Ambiance? 5 star- if you like nature that is.

I ordered red wine chocolate torte- with all kinds of good stuff around it. A winner for sure.

Portions are just right to me; filling but not feeling sick stuffed.

I can't wait to bring my friends here. They will be so pleasantly surprised I believe.

Come to the gardens!! I love them even without this delicious gem of a restaurant.

Almost forgot!!! Service perfect too. Attentive and intuitive without being interrupting."}
{"text":"Very nice little restaurant linked with the desert botanical gardens. There is indoor and outdoor seating, the atmosphere is casual and it's great for families or even one or two people ! The food was great.. I got the Gertrude burger and it tasted great... however, was a bit messy. Our staff, Joshua , was very friendly and attentive. I think the cost might have been a little high, but you know what, i will not even complain about it.   think this place is great !"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place a lot. The food was very well presented and tasty as good as it looked. The service was also great. No complaints. Will be going back in the future."}
{"text":"Meh to the nth degree.  Gorgeous setting in the botanical gardens, but that's just about the only standout feature. Hostess was rude and abrasive to everyone, not just us. The server was friendly enough, but the food was rather slow to come out and it wasn't even a full house. The menu was trying to be inventive and clever, but the dishes fell short. My group ordered the king salmon, which was tiny for $23; the tacos, which lacked zing; the banana French toast, which was just a few pieces of banana bread with strawberry compote across the top; and the hot mess, which was oddly spiced and just not all the exciting. The best food item we had was the doughnuts with the three kinds of dipping sauce. If you have no choice, it's fine, but if you do, go elsewhere for less."}
{"text":"Ate there first time we visited the Botanical Gardens. Was told by the waiter how good the steak sandwich was. It was so tough I couldn't eat it. Place was way over priced too! We have been back to the gardens but not Gertrude's."}
{"text":"Gertrudes has perhaps one of the greatest settings in Phoenix. We dined there this month on the patio among beautiful Spring colors and smells. The  service is great! The shoe drops with the prices.......I ordered minestrone with wheat berry, listed among the entrees for $22. What arrived was a lovely bowl of fine tasting minestrone which should not have been listed in the entree section nor should it bear the price tag of $22. It was a total rip off and deceptively advertised as an entree. Others in the group were satisfied but not greatly enthused."}
{"text":"Pickled grapes? Wow!

I stopped in here with my cousin during my recent visit to the Desert Botanical Garden featuring Chihuly. We wanted to grab a quick drink while waiting for the sun to set for the day. I was surprised when we checked with the hostess that they were booked full for the next 1.5 hours! Note to self and everyone else: make a reservation for evening seating.

Diners can choose indoor or outdoor seating, and the outdoor patio is heated in the cooler months. It has a classy ambiance, and the outdoor patio gives you the garden feel.

We chatted with the bartender for a while. Her cocktail knowledge shown through as we improvised a non-alcoholic drink into an alcoholic drink as well. The drinks (a spiced rum type mojito and cactus something or other tasted refreshing and light.

Service at the bar was prompt and attentive. Both food and beverages worked well together and took minimal amounts of time to receive. 

We also ordered the artisan cheese plate. I liked that it came with flat, grainy chips so as to not be too filling (compared to thick bread). The three cheeses represented a good mix (soft cow cheese with ash rind, goat's cheese, and I'm at a loss on the third but it was my cousin's favorite.We did ask the bartender to re-explain which was which twice already. They did, of course, but cheerily and very willingly.

 To create and change the tastes, they offered a strawberry spread (not a huge fan of strawberries, but it was still tasty) and in-house pickled grapes. Wow, those grapes were something because they also picked up hints of herbs, likely fresh from the gardens as well.  

Both the bartenders and servers at Gertrude's have a flair for showing their knowledge and I appreciate when the staff can speak intelligently of the food.

The food at other tables looked divine. Portions looked great and all the diners were happy and chatting away. 

I highly recommend making a reservation for a visit to Gertrude's while at the botanical gardens. I look forward to coming back in spring and sampling additional cocktails and dishes. Also,before walking over, stop in the washroom if you've already walked around because I was a little dusty from the trails and the washrooms are across from the gift store and not inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Gertrude's is in such a pretty area, loved the table centerpiece, artwork, and live music. I'm glad we chose Gertrude's for our Christmas Eve brunch. All 7 of us enjoyed our food.. Well presented, as well as delicious. 

We had the french toast, American breakfast, Eggs Benedict with chorizo, and biscuits and gravy. The prickly pear mimosa was yummy as well as the prickly pear jam. Everything tasted super fresh and the eggs were perfectly done. 

I can't wait to return one evening for a date night dinner with my husband. I'm a huge fan of botanical gardens, so for me the area is lovely. The service was terrific and all of our questions were answered with knowledge."}
{"text":"This is a great place to enjoy a leisurely meal before or after enjoying the Botanic Gardens. The outside seating places you up close and personal to the local fauna. The inside seating is great too, but outside is preferred. The chicken wrap was very basic but the fries were worth the trip! The butternut squash soup of the day was disappointing without much flavor and the salad was OK but nothing to rush back for.  Service was casual without any particular concern for filling water glasses. The atmosphere is the reason to come and the food is a close second."}
{"text":"Beautiful place to have lunch while getting some break from the heat while walking around the botanical gardens. Menu was great and apparently changes throughout the year which gives some variety. Had the sandwich of the day which was super delicious, and staff was super accommodating with a friend who has food allergies. Hummus appetizer is a must!and you must check out the gift shop attached. Super cute stuff!"}
{"text":"A nice gift to the Botanical Gardens experience. This is a treat to provide you with a nice meal before or after touring the Botanical Gardens. The relaxing and scenic atmosphere makes for a relaxing time."}
{"text":"We stopped In at Gertrude's for lunch after walking the Botanical Gardens. Very nice restaurant and great atmosphere. It opens up completely to the patio which makes it more enjoyable. Our waiter was extremely nice and accommodating. We all ordered the French toast, and I have to say it is the best French toast I have ever had.  Not overly sweet and tastes wonderful.  I highly recommend stopping there when you go to the Desert Botanical Gardens."}
{"text":"I went to Gertrude's for breakfast for my birthday on Sunday. The surroundings are beautiful (the botanical garden). The husband and I sat on the patio and it was a nice morning. The food was nothing special, I had the highly recommended hot mess... it was alright, but not worth the hefty price tag. The husband got the chicken sandwich, which, again, was nothing special, and cost a lot of money. It wasn't bad, and the service was decent, but it was nothing worth raving over and I don't think I would go back.... 40$ for an average breakfast just seems a bit ridiculous."}
{"text":"Scenery is beautiful and love the atmosphere with seating on the patio.  Service and food were not what I would consider up to par for a restaurant in this setting and price range.  The dinner menu is limited.  Chicken sandwiches were o.k. but dinner salads (with chicken and salmon) were very bland.  We asked for more dressing and also told our server the nuts listed on the menu were omitted.  The server never came back to ask if we wanted another beverage, water glasses were not refilled.  
I will not dine here again."}
{"text":"Very cute place where you can walk around and look at the botanical garden... I made reservations for indoors but they had the door open linking the outdoor patio with indoors. And let me tell you, it was super hot in the restaurant. The whole time I was sitting indoors, I was sweating n sticking to the leather seats.. not really what I was hoping for a fabulous Sunday brunch place especially when I reserved for indoor seating... so besides sweating through out brunch, our food took forever. It was fine since we spent the entire time catching up and ordering drinks. We had 2-3 drinks before our food finally came out. I had the red sangria... it was tasty but I have to agree with other people's reviews on the price of this place. It's definitely overpriced. But the service was great!! Our server was very attentive and was amazing!!! I had a mimosa and will probably advise not to get it... stick to their specialty cocktails instead. I also had a prickly pear margarita and it was very good. Then I got the B.L.T.E. which comes with eggs (ur choice) large strips of bacon, tomato, lettuce in between two ciabatta bread. It also came w fresh made potato chips. It was very filling and it was good. My mother had the frittata and she said it was tasty. And my husband got the steak and eggs which he thought was delicious. So the food here is very good but it's a little overpriced and I get it. You're in the middle of the botanical garden... the atmosphere is beautiful and that's what you are paying for. Just wished the indoor seating wasn't so hot..."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant inside the Dessert Botanical Garden.  We are outside next to the cacti and listened to live music on the patio.  Nice atmosphere and good refreshing meal.  Friendly staff too"}
{"text":"Heard good things about Gertrude's and was excited to try it at the Botanical Garden. 
Came in and was immediately led to an umbrellaed table on the patio.  Quail were walking around nearby, very cute.  It was hot but there was a cool breeze.  Our waited welcomed us and did water service.  He was also training a new waitress.  Ordered the cheese board to start.  You get a variety of nibbles and smears with small pieces of cheeses.  Pickled squash was everywhere.  Not really a fan and yet that was the majority on the platter.  Tried the prickly pear iced tea.  It was ok. Probably won't order again.  The drink was mostly ice.  Ordered the house salad of mixed greens and salmon.  Salad was delicious, so was the tiny 2\"x2\" piece of $8 salmon.  Basically, you pay for eating in the garden.  Ok, had that experience.  Probably won't come for a meal.  It was outrageously priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Very very beautiful place for dinner. Great selection of food choices. The best was the wings. We chose this as our restaurant club one month and it's a place i would suggest to others for a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"After touring the Desert Botanical Gardens this weekend, we heard a guitarist singing at Gertudes so decided to have a quick beer, relax and listen. The hostess said to please seat ourselves at the bar or we could get a table. It was 3 pm and the patio was nearly empty so we sat at a table off near the edge. A very kind waiter quickly took our drink order. Shortly thereafter the female manager came over to chastise us for apparently choosing the one table of nearly 20 empty tables that was presumably reserved in precisely one hour. By far the rudest manager I've ever encountered considering part of their job is being nice and customer satisfaction. We are adults and felt like naughty children without a clue what we did wrong. We quickly drank our one beer and left. Would not consider going back to try the food. No idea why such a beautiful establishment hired such a wicked manager. It was our first and last visit."}
{"text":"Stopped here to grab lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. We participated in the brunch menu, I had the smoked chicken salad and my husband had the steak and eggs. For dessert we shared a flourless brownie with pumpkin brittle and jalepano cranberry sauce, all delicious! Eating outside was nice to watch the birds. They had heaters going since it was a bit chilly. Also the wine and cocktail list was pretty decent selection."}
{"text":"The first star is for how conveniently located this establishment is. Business is primarily driven by tired tourists who have wandered around in the brutal Arizona sun for far too long. Second star is for their house potato chips, which I thought was quite fantastic. Third is for the wine that we ordered, which also turned out pretty great. Sadly, I didn't find any other redeeming qualities here. 

Our server seemed to either be having a terrible day or he is in the wrong profession. We asked for water while we looked at the menu. He came back and slammed the glasses on the table, which alarmed us a little bit. We decided to get a bottle of the Jules Taylor Sauvignon Blanc. This was a pretty great bottle and undid some of the unpleasantness from the service. I ordered Huevos Rancheros and asked that my eggs be scrambled instead of fried. But of course, it came out with fried eggs. The food itself was okay.. not terrible but I wasn't jumping up and down in delight either. The fingerling potatoes it came with were lackluster and under seasoned. There is so much you can do with breakfast potatoes!

It's time for another round of training for some members of the wait staff. Overall, it was an underwhelming experience. Meh!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Everything we ordered was delicious! Must try the Short rib & chicken sandwich. The lemonade is tasty too!"}
{"text":"Your comments mean nothing contact you on website for what purpose?
Bottom line food was terrible and overpriced . You don't rate even 1 star"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & nice crew. I started off with the hummus appetizer and wow it looked like a work of art! Tasted even better! Almost devoured the whole thing but then my main course came out. I ordered Gerttrude's Greens and added grilled chicken. Wow, the dressing and the mixed greens all combined with that chicken was awesome. You have to taste it to believe it! The dressing g is not sweet and the chicken was not overwhelming with seasonings it was just perfect. I highly recommend this place to others. If you have more than 4 in your party you may want to sit on their patio for more comfort. The inside dimming room is smaller. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing! Daniel our server was awesome, very friendly and informative! 

The French fries were some of the best fries I've ever had. I can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"This was the second time I went to Gertrude's. This was a suggestion from someone in the area. The menu is very limited and not for everyone. There was little that looked appealing to me. And the prices were high for the quality received. The service was the saving grace!!! They were incredible! No one went without a beverage and they kept up with cleaning off the plates. 

The Botanical Gardens are beautiful!"}
{"text":"I've attended Gertrude's of the botanical garden a number of times and I must admit...the food is wonderful..not many times have I tried food at restaurants and everything that I've had is amazing.  The chefs and cooks blend the seasons with the flavors very well. All of the service staff are friendly and very knowledgable of their menu of drinks and food...I will be back sooner than later...thank you for such a wonderful dining experience"}
{"text":"I've been to Gertrude's twice, one for a full dinner at a table, the other time for drinks and dinner at the bar.  I an all in my parties thoroughly enjoyed both visits -- I have to say, especially the one at the bar!  Our bartender was personable and made some *great* wine recommendations.

Service, atmosphere, food, and of course the views are all wonderful.  Sit outside if weather permits, which it usually does, for an extra-special experience.  While this did not  bother me personally, someone I was with said that the noise level was a bit high for her taste but still overall she enjoyed the experience.

I was glad to learn that Gertrude's operation is carried out right there on-site (as in, not catered-in in any sense).  Oh and one other thing, if you go to a concert at the Garden, stop in before for early dinner.  It's a great time!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to come here and it was definitely worth the wait. The blackened scallops are mouth watering. So good and so sad it's seasonal. The service was awesome, fast and friendly. Great little place to enjoy a drink and conversation. The atmosphere is perfect for the one on one moments. I will return for the brunch very soon."}
{"text":"I have been anxious to try this place with it's great reviews. Last month I joined the Garden with my mom and today we finally made it to Gertrude's. Delish! Attentive and friendly service with some excellent recommendations. It's chilly outside today so we started with their hot tea - peppermint variety and perfect for the day. My mom enjoyed the BLT with fried green tomatoes, crispy bacon, fresh leafy lettuce, and a delectable remoulade sauce. I may have spelled that incorrectly! French fries were crispy and hot. I had the warm cauliflower salad with roasted cauliflower and acorn squash, fried kale, and a toasted oil vinaigrette. It was warm and comforting and absolutely delicious. Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Went here on a voucher and although the drinks were great and the wedge salad divine.  The decor was shabby chic but we just didn't feel like we belonged with the urban hipsters of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I had the breakfast bowl, there wasn't too many options on the menu to chose from. I felt like it was mainly towards people who drink, they have two menus for alcohol. And two small sections for food. My breakfast bowl was different, it was a good different though. Not sure if I would come back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing to say the least. Nestled in the Botanical Gardens, the perfect place to end a greet adventure. I had a smoked salmon cake covered in caviar. This was only complemented by the fresh white sangria. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. If you are looking for a wine list. This was pretty esoteric and maybe could use a few familiars for the non geek wine drinker. All in all I give it a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Really expensive. Don't eat here unless you're rich. If you're here and want to grab a drink, go for it since it's in the Garden and looks awesome."}
{"text":"The food was ok and service was not great. When we got there we wanted to sit outside and it was chilly. They didn't offer to move a heater to our table. I ordered the margarita and it was way too sour. Took forever for them to bring us water. They were out of the meal I wanted and only had one left, I let my husband get it. It was the short rib and tasted like beef jerky. Too smokey and chewy. I ordered the sea bass and they brought the wrong dish. I ended up eating the salmon and chowder and it is an odd pairing. Pretty bland. Disappointing meal but I called and the manager offered to comp our next meal."}
{"text":"It's hard for me to rate this restaurant.  In the one hand I do find their food and service to be pretty good, even above average.  The location is excellent, since I go to the botanical gardens a lot.  A LOT.  And I work a mile away from there, so when I feel like getting out of the office, I go there.  Yes, it's a bit pricey, but I don't mind that so much (even though I have suggested that they need to do discounts in the summer, when the gardens are completely dead).

I do mind that this restaurant is definitely crafted for non-family groups.  It just doesn't feel comfortable to go there after walking around the garden, sweaty, with little kids.  I get dirty looks from other people.  

And the botanical gardens are a family place...so why isn't the restaurant?"}
