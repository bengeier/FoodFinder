{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open for a while, and finally had the chance to grab a few friends to try it out. The decor is very trendy and there are artpieces that pay homage to our great city of Toronto. The waitress explained to us that \"Provo\" means \"to try, to taste, and to experience\", which is the philosophy behind the tapas-style menu.   We ordered 5 tapas and a burger among the three of us and were sufficiently filled. The best dish of the night (and best value) was undoubtedly the Provo Burger. The tomato bacon jam is delicious, as is the pain au lait bun. I would also recommend the pork tenderloin because it had a great texture, I'm not the biggest fan of the spatzle though. The smoked trout in the salad was also noteworthy. Most of the other tapas were a bit underwhelming: the oyster ceviche had interesting presentation but the yuzu taste completely overpowered the oyster; the Jamaican pork shoulder was acceptable but lacked depth in its spiciness (more meat seasoning would probably help); and the rigatoni provo was more al dente and not as hot as I was accustomed to for pasta.  Overall, an enjoyable experience. I didn't have the chance to try their drinks and cocktails, but the bar seems very well stocked and most people there seemed to be enjoying themselves at the bar."}
{"text":"I was walking by this place for some time and finally it opened and we went in. I have to confess that italian style tapas are not quite as good as I thought. Small portions of italian style food is not a tapas bar. My anchovy crostini failed, the greens salad was quite nice, the linguini was tasty but the calamari wasn't that interesting. The space is definately more of a trendy bar with some small dishes of food as a side to the drinks. Better to enjoy with a group of friends and not as a couple's night out. Not on the top of my favorites."}
{"text":"We love Provo Foodbar so much that we recently held our wedding reception there. So many of our guests commented that it was the best wedding reception that they have ever attended. Amazing food, craft beer, service and atmosphere, it's no surprise to us why they all enjoyed it so much. Thank you Provo Foodbar!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find good food near the AGO if you don't want fast, pub or asian-style.   Went here tonight and ordered 5 dishes between two of us, plus one dessert.  Aracini were excellent, along with the kimchi chicken wings and Jamaican pork shoulder with rice. The pork was melt-in-your-mouth tender.   The stand-out dishes were the roasted beet and pear appetizer and the roasted brussel sprouts.  Will definitely be going back here soon."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have this new addition to my neighborhood! We came for brunch on Sunday and had an excellent experience. The food was delicious. I had the Provo breakfast with three eggs, toast, bacon, and beans. My friend had huevos rancheros and said it was the best she's had. My husband had something else he really liked, and our toddler had delicious French toast.   The atmosphere was great. Spacious, interesting decor, not too noisy or crowded feeling. And the staff were very accommodating for the little guy. There is lots of room for a stroller if you have one with you.  Thumbs up! Looking forward to trying the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with a friend. Place is small, but cozy. It wasn't busy on that Saturday afternoon, so we were given the choice to see where ever we wanted. Good beer selection. Service was good, switched half way through, but no big deal, pretty seamless.  We both ordered burgers; I got the Turkey Burger and she got the Jerk Chicken Sandwich. My burger was kinda blah and tasted like it was a frozen patty. My friend said the jerk chicken was spicy, but not enough sauce. Fries were alright.  Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Overall - 2.5/5.0  Decided to check this place out as I was in the area and wanted to hit up a casual joint with tapas/small plates.  The Good: - Service was attentive and friendly. - Braised Beef Cheeks: Meat was tender as expected given that it was slow cooked. Although the purée could have been a bit more seasoned.   The Bad: - Food quality and portion size did not match up with the price point at all. - Asian Crab & Shrimp Cakes: Flavours were okay but it was lukewarm and quite small in size. Outer layer could have a bit more of a crisp/bite to it. It reminded me of those hors d'oeuvres that you would get at a wedding cocktail reception. - Wild Mushroom Linguini: Noodles were al dente but at the same time had a starchy feel to it. Almost as if it had been sitting out for a while and reheated. In terms of portion size, 3 people barely managed to get two forks into this dish.  Noticed quite a few reviews had negative comments but their rating did not seem to correctly reflect that. Note that it was prime time Saturday night and only a third of the tables were occupied. It appears that they have been in business for less than a year. At this rate, I'm not sure how long they can sustain their business given the stiff competition around the area.  Personally, I will not be coming back as there are other restaurants with much better quality food within the same price range. (i.e. check out Nuit Social as an option for casual dining with tapas/small plates - excellent dishes!)"}
{"text":"This review is on their brunch only as I've yet to try their dinner. Been here a few times for brunch with my husband and we love the food here. Their Chicken and Waffle is amazing and I really like the Eggs Charlotte."}
{"text":"Ugh, such lame food.  I asked the waiter how the Jambalaya was and he said \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  It will never leave the menu because it's popular\".  Well, it absolutely sucked.  Basically burnt pizza sauce with overcooked bits of chicken, grissly sausage and 1 overcooked shrimp.  I'm pretty sure this was made a week ago and reheated every day.  Seriously, don't go here.  We were a party of 4 and everyone's food was similar.  None of us would go back.  The owners should be embarrassed to own a restaurant that serves food like this."}
{"text":"We've always had excellent food here and they have lots of gluten-free options and are careful about preparing them. Pair that with interesting craft beers, a good wine list and proximity to the AGO, it all makes Provo a great Dundas & McCaul spot."}
{"text":"Came here late Sunday night. I really like the idea of a small plates bar. Sometimes I'm not that hungry, but want a small meal, but don't want a regular portion. They do have full sized sandwiches. This place also has \"half mains\" at about $9-14 and they are about half the size of what you can get at normal food place. It's a nice way to try more food. But unfortunately this is plagued by their small menu selection. If you want to do small plates, I think you need a bigger selection of stuff.   Another reason to not come back is more direct: the quality. While the food was decent, it was not \"good\". I personally liked the jerk chicken sandwich. But the Jamaican pork shoulder on rice was very disappointing. I did not taste the so called \"coconut\" in the rice. And the pork shoulder was pretty tasteless, even for my standards.   Decor is nice. I would think this is more of a drinks place than a food place. Service is ok for a Western place. Not a top choice for me when I'm area but I wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"Didn't have the best experience here. I had the Tinder Date cocktail and the Provo burger. The cocktail was good but the burger was overdone, dry, and flavourless. The french  fries were soft and really greasy. Only upside was that the service was fast and friendly. Kind of a shame since I was excited to try this place, but sadly I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Located across from the AGO, Provo is a great place to stop before or after a show. Provo has a wide variety of local brews and a great selection of small plates. I came here after going to cinq-a-sept across the street. The restaurant was easy to grab a seat in and our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful.  We ordered the mushroom linguine, salmon special, Brussel sprouts and chocolate mousse. Highly recommend trying to Brussel sprouts, they were amazing!  The plates themselves were great to split, though the mushroom linguine was a bit on the salty side - otherwise, I'd definitely recommend giving Provo a try!  Great spot for a date or an intimate dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Really good food and decent beer selection.  Friendly staff and great space with a back area available for parties or events.  Was here only three times so far, but for a quiet early night drink this is my kind of place."}
{"text":"Beautiful space but really disappointing. 6 of us went, tried many of the tapas, but none were memorable. Most were underseasoned. The duck rillette was bland, as was the calamari. The smelts were very tasty, but on a bed of soggy french fries. The lamb tasted great, but was accompanied by unseasoned couscous.  The beef short rib was excellent, but too many misses and too few high points. Not recommended."}
{"text":"My partner and I have been here twice. Very, very good experiences overall.   The pasta selection is delicious. And al dente! Honestly one of the best pasta dishes I've had was the mushroom linguine. My partner really loves the rigatoni.   This time, we had the seasonal kale salad - very scrumptious! The flavours meld together really well.   My partner recommends the pear cider. You get a big portion of it. I got a glass of wine. The wine menu is extensive and the descriptions really help you choose what you want.  The service is amazing. Very prompt and polite. Not too intruding but not too avoidant, either. They give you a nice little postcard with your receipt.  The location is great because it's right next to the AGO. So if you're too early for your timed tickets, you can come here to waste some time and have a good meal while you're at it!   My only strife and the reason why I knocked off a star is because of an unmentioned charge. This establishment charges $3.00 for water! What even? I never got charged for water at a restaurant before. They never even mentioned this charge. So that was a surprise on the bill at the end of a wonderful meal that I was less than happy with."}
{"text":"disapointing because we were given a breakfast menu and after deciding for 10 minutes what we wanted to ordered the menu was taken away and stated breakfast was no longer served.  like seriously?  talk about disorganization and lack of communication from the person who seated us and the server.  and 'breakfast only til 2:45?  really?  otherwise food was good about 4/5 service mediocre about 3/5. atmosphere and decor pretty cool and current.   nithing to rave about but it was decent."}
{"text":"I love the feel of this place. It's so open and nice. The brunch is done really well - with probably the best mimosas ever!! Really nice place to even go alone and enjoy a glass of wine and read a book. Awesome wine list too."}
{"text":"There's a lot of brunch to be had in Toronto, but the Huevos Rancheros I had here constitute the best brunch of my life. Flavourful, fresh, and creative. The side of beans was delicious and the egg was perfectly runny. The price is on the high side, but well worth it. I came back a second time to make sure it wasn't a fluke, and it wasn't."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about Provo   To start of on a positive note, staff here are great. They are friendly and attentive.   Food, however, fell short of my expectations. Tried the crab and shrimp cakes, chopped salad, jerk chicken burger with fries, calamari, and jambalaya.  The crab cakes were good, but not much bigger than the size of a toonie. Chopped salad was bland. Jerk chicken burger didn't taste like jerk chicken, and fries were a bit soggy.   Calamari was my favourite dish, ever so tender pieces drenched in fresh tomato sauce with garlic and herbs. Jambalaya was also good, rice had a great texture, with pieces of chicken and shrimp.   I just can't justify paying ~$10 for some of the tiny portioned subpar food.   Overall verdict: much better tapas places elsewhere, would come here for brunch to give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"I rarely want to write a review, before I'm done with my meal, and Provo is one of those rare gems. We stumbled upon it quite by accident, after going to the AGO, and what a wonderful accident it was.  The place is exceptionally cozy, and the open space closer to the street is great - you get a patio feel, without being outside (there is a tiny bit of outside seating as well).  I've done something odd, and tried their steak (I'm really picky on steak), and this was probably the best value for money steak I've ever had (make no mistake, there is better steak to be had elsewhere, but not at this price level). We've tried a few appetizers, and a few main dishes (the salmon was also excellent, and the burgers were quite decent - their smelt is to die for).  The beer selection is very appealing, and so even before we paid, we knew we are coming back!"}
{"text":"Provo is a wonderful addition to the central Dundas St. W area, being aesthetically different from its neighbouring restaurants, Village Idiot Pub and Sin & Redemption. Provo offers an open space with high ceilings that is accommodating for simply lounging or having a drink right at the bar. Best item on the menu would have to be the Provo Burger...it has bacon jam on it, enough said. Their signature cocktails are delightful and they have a nice selection of craft beers and wines. The bar staff are uniquely engaging and very friendly. Provo is a great place to bring a first date and you will want to return again very soon. If you happen to find yourself in the area on a Sunday night, bottles of wine at half price, great perk!!"}
{"text":"Right across the AGO so this spot is conveniently located.  They also have a beautiful mural painted on their exterior wall which helps bring in foot traffic. This was what brought us in. Once inside the interior was rustic but modern and a joy to sit in.   we ordered a couple jerk sandwiches, the shrimp sandwich and the wild mushroom fettuccini. Honestly, all these dishes were a disappointment. The wild Mushroom pasta was doused in truffle oil which really overpowered the whole dish. I couldn't finish my plate. The jerk sandwiche was okay but it was a little over salted and I didn't get to try the shrimp sandwich - but it did look decently plated.   Overall, the food was a disappointment but this is a nice spot for drinks before or after visiting the gallery."}
{"text":"Price was very reasonable, nice ambiance with great tapas sized portion for sharing. Service was great but not enough staff on the floor.  Maybe because we went after xmas, they thought it wouldn't be as busy,but the restaurant filled up pretty quickly closer to 8pm. Great window view with the AGO in the background, streetcars, tall windows, nice wine selection. Great location but would need to look for street parking which wasn't too hard to find. Glad we discovered this hidden gem in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Walked into this gem just outside the museum while looking for a spot with brunch. They don't have any cuisine dedicated specifically to Canada, but more on an international basis. Can speak to the huevos rancheros and eggs Benedict which I was very pleased with. Great service and great food, but don't take AMEX. Would recommend to anyone in the area"}
{"text":"Very clean and friendly place. But the portion size of my pasta was too small. Their pasta entree is the size of an appetizer. For that reason I do not know if I can return. I cannot leave a restaurant still feeling hungry."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on Friday afternoon with some colleagues. The food was delicious, prices were really reasonable and the space is modern and comforting. Another wonderful perk for work lunches is that they can split the bill if there is a birthday celebration among 8 or less people so that the group can cover the birthday person's meal. I appreciated how they had diverse options with various flavors. If you were looking for a burger, to oysters ($2 everyday) or jambalaya - it was available in smaller portions ( a bit more than a tapa). For me, it allowed me to try several things. They also had a great drinks menu, over 20 craft beers and a wine list. The service was warm, friendly and quick. If you are in the area, this is a gem."}
{"text":"Perhaps I had too high of an expectation of this place because it markets itself as the taste of world tapas. The atmosphere and the vibe of the restaurant was trendy and cool and the service fast. However We tried most of the signature dishes but nothing really outstanding. If I were to rank the top three dishes we tried, they would be the wild mushroom linguini, duck confit rillette and the Branzino. Overall the dishes lacked flavour complexity. The braised beef cheek was too chewy and it was salty with too much soy sauce, the only thing that saved the dish was the edamame and celery root purée. Oyster ceviche flavours were too overwhelming and it completely overpowered the flavour of oyster."}
{"text":"I spend a lot of time walking on Dundas, so it was inevitably that I'd stop into Provo FoodBar to sample their wares.  We arrived around noon on a Saturday and the place was about half full. I glanced at the brunch menu and immediately made my choice: Huevos Rancheros (tortillas + refried beans + 2 eggs + avocado + salsa rosa). I was asked how I wanted my eggs prepared and, of course, I said overeasy. (What's better than breaking into the yolk and letting it run all over the plate? Nothing, I say!)  The dish arrived a short time later and looked like a picture-perfect example of Huevos Rancheros. And indeed, this was a very, very tasty example of the Mexican staple. The fried tortillas were on point, and the refried beans/salsa roja were a perfect accompaniment. (I also really dug the guacamole and sour cream that were presented on the side.)  My only real complaint here was the almost total lack of spice. There were a couple of jalapenos contained within the dish, but aside from that there wasn't a hint of heat to this dish. I asked for hot sauce, assuming that maybe there was a house-made dressing I could use, but was offered either Sriracha or Tabasco.  That unfortunate element aside, I really, really enjoyed my meal and would happily return to try more of Provo's wares."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Funky room.  Simple menu. Good flavours. Somewhat ambitious wine list, with a decent selection by the glass. Good service, friendly and professional. Would come again."}
{"text":"This has been a enclave to relax and chill for quiet meal before taking a class at the AGO. It is great for small group of 4 or if you are on your own.  I have tried the Wild Boar Ragu Paperdelle, Provo Burger, and when they had it a Branzino Filet. All were a culinary delight and placed me in state of creativity necessary for a drawing class at the AGO.  When in the area it is a must go."}
{"text":"Great spot for lovely bites or a tasty order of huevos and Caesars on a weekend!! A neighborhood fave. Honest food and great service."}
{"text":"We got the brunch egg Benedict. Tasted great. Price is reasonable. However, the service was mediocre... I never got my coffee refilled in the 1.5 hours sitting lol. And when we wanted to pay with Amex, the machine didn't work. The server simply stated \"oh it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't\" without trying to solve the problem nor apologizing...."}
{"text":"Decent spot with some good choices on their menu. We tried: the Salmon with quinoa fritters, Kimchi chicken wings, Navy bean and ricotta crostini, Sausage corn dogs, Shrimp and crab cakes, Arancini and lastly the Clementine panna cotta.  The kimchi chicken wings, corn dogs and arancini weren't anything to brag about, but they were bad. The crostini, salmon, crab cakes and panna cotta were all delicious though and I would highly recommend. We also tried 3 cocktails and all were great!  It's brand new, so the service was friendly but not the most attentive or knowledgable. I'd go back once it irons any kinks out try a few more things."}
{"text":"Tapas style share plates, you can get full for $50 (5 share plates and 2 drinks each). Loved their prosecco/vodka cocktail - it's a must! As are the kimchi chicken wings - deeeelish! There's still some room for improvement on their menu, beef cheeks were a rather fatty, risotto balls were crunchy but lukewarm inside, croquettes a little on the small side and there was no dessert menu, which was disappointing. BUT, please take all of this with a grain of salt as they are starting up and are open to feedback - so please speak up (to all the polite Canadians out there) - help them succeed!"}
{"text":"Great service.   Yummy cocktails.   Incredibly affordable but limited menu.  Hope they plan to switch up the menus!  Tons of potential.   My favourite was the smoke trout"}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out on a Saturday night.  Atmosphere is nice. Great wine selection with wide variety of local beers on tab. Service was also great, everyone was attentive and prompt.   The lacking part is their food. The biggest gripe I have with this place is on the portion size, the size of dishes definitely do not reflect its price.   I ordered the shrimp and crab cake for appetizer, tasted great, but serving size was extremely small. I could compare the serving size to some hor d'oeuvres. We got five small ball-cakes.  For my main, I ordered the jerk chicken sandwich. Chicken did not taste fresh, could have been dark meat. Once again, small portion size, I'd say I had around half a chicken breast (chickens are diced). Sad to say that the fries were the best part of the dish.   Overall, I would not come back. With competitions so near by, I was surprised to see such lack of quality in their food. If you prefer atmosphere and varieties of beer/wine, I would definitely recommend this place. But if you are keen on having some good food, this place is not it.  Be aware, you will encounter people enjoying craft beer way too much. They will reek of 'I drink craft beer over Heineken, respect me' vibe as you stroll by them to go to the bathroom. Ignore these people at all costs, these mouth-breathers will turn whatever delicious craft beer they have been drinking to a stream of mustard gas that will send shivers down your spine. Without sounding anti-museum-ist, these people flock right from the AGO, which is just across the street. They drink themselves to oblivion while discussing how they can 'clearly see the absurdity within the ordered-chaos of this Number 1A piece by Jackson Pollock'.  By the way, if I haven't emphasized the serving size enough, we decided to eat more at a different restaurant since this place could not satisfy our hunger."}
{"text":"Dishes: arancini, Jamaican pork shoulder, calamari, brussel sprouts w pancetta.  I think this place is not worth the price. Each dish was about 9$ except for the brussel sprouts which were 5$.  I've had better arancini at Porchetta.   Although this one came w three balls. The brussel sprouts were not as good as at Momofuku. They were not as crispy as I would have preferred. The calamari had good flavour and the pork shoulder was nice and spicy.   The plates are fairly okay sized for tapas but for two ppl it came to about $40. I could tell my boyfriend was still hungry. If you have any kind of appetite be prepared to spend a bit more.   I have to say the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Provo is my spot for Saturdays. Best music, staff is awesome, and the food is wicked good. Beef carpaccio is ridiculous and brunch is bomb. Hidden gem - also it's closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Came in here a few times. Once for a bar lunch and once for brunch with family.  Food and service have always been amazing. I would recommend their beef carpaccio as an authentic appetizing delight... their huevo rancheros was an experience... I've never tried it before but I'm definitely hooked now.  The chicken and waffles were cooked also to perfection.  Their tiramisu is amazing for dessert but only if it is made fresh. Would recommend this intimate spot for any occasion."}
{"text":"Interesting place serving appetizers, small bites, and tapas with their own twist.  The interior is a small, dark, intimate industrial deco space with a mellow low-key vibe (great music mix tape!).  Best offerings that we had that evening: wild mushroom linguine, musky with truffle oil; smelt & chips - fried smelt light as a cloud and fries that were thin and crisp. The braised beef cheeks were super-luscious and melt-in-the-mouth, with a creamy edamame puree that complemented them very well.  The calamari was tender in a garlic-tomato sauce.  Somewhat of a miss: Boudin corn dogs were a strange taste combination and surprisingly bland ... and the cinnamon-laden sauce accompanying them added to the strangeness.  Their crostini were merely okay -- the house-made bread was good but the toppings only so-so and a bit bland again (eggplant caviar & vinegared white anchovy with tomato - the latter was somewhat better).  Provo has a small but decent wine list (excellent Spanish sparkling wine by the glass) and good cocktails (liked the KW craft cider) and kids enjoyed their non-alcoholic \"agua frescas\", in particular, the yuzu citrus lemonade."}
{"text":"A very enjoyable experience.   Firstly, this place has a gorgeous interior and is surprisingly big for having a casual frontage on Dundas W. We had attentive, great service both times we were there: for dinner and for brunch.   For dinner I tried the carpaccio, jambalaya, braised beef cheek and calamari. Everything was fantastic and we enjoyed the carpaccio so much, we had to order another!  For brunch, it really doesn't get much better than the huevos rancheros with a caeser or a nice cup of coffee.   What's really cool about this place, is the price point. You can get high quality dishes that are comparable to a lot of other great restaurants in the City, yet at a lower price. I am really looking forward to making my way further around the menu - would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I went after visiting the Infinity mirrors exhibit at the AGO, around 10pm.   The food and service was quick. I had a tinder date which was amazing and tasty, I definitely drank it too fast. For dinner had the crab cakes which were tasty but a little tough. And the jambalaya risotto for dinner, also tasty but the sauce was a little generic. When we left the restaurant was mostly empty and it took a while to get the bills hut I would come back forsure."}
