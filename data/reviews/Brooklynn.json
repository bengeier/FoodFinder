{"text":"It's so sad the way Toronto always feels the need to reference New York in order to seem cool. perhaps this place is good during slow periods. In the evening, though? Too loud, obnoxious crowd, just. . . . no. Of course if you enjoy not being able to hear or speak, and appreciate the screaming attentions of bloated, overdressed males, and feel festive when your toes are being stomped upon by glaring harridans in stillettoes they cannot walk in, then by all means! Otherwise? Save your money for a trip to the actual Brooklyn."}
{"text":"Brooklynn is not the club district. Get past that you'll have a good time. West Queen West is smaller, more laid back, and way way cooler. Friendly staff and good music."}
{"text":"Here was my experience at Brooklyn:
It is full of Bitches and DoucheBags. This is Not an understatement. 
I was visiting Toronto from NYC, and I go to this bar and pay $5 Cover (Should have been my first clue). 
People here are incredibly rude here. The patrons probably think this bar was implanted here from Brooklyn, NY and they try to act like they are in NYC. 
I can assure these folks that people in Brooklyn NYC DONT act like a bunch of bitches. I have never had so many people run into me, not apologize, place their drink on my napkin (twice by the same person). 
Skip this place. Upon exiting, go left a few doors, there is a dive bar that is SO much better. 
Brooklyn just sucked."}
{"text":"I don't know why yelp says this is a pub with food cuz as far as i know its not. what it is is probably one of my favourite bars in the city. the 2 guys that run it are awesome and really nice - not to mention super hot. 
music is fun, crowd is cool and unpretentious and it almost always gets rowdy and crazy which is a bonus. definitely anything-goes kinda place which is refreshing and always equals super fun times"}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm not much of a \"clubber\" but when I do go out on a Friday/Saturday night this is one of my go-to spots. It's packed, but usually has a short line, cover is cheap (or free sometimes for girls..) and it's unpretentious. The crowd is great and the music is fun. Overall, great times."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a slightly older, less douchey crowd than you would find on Richmond , Brooklynn is for you. With a small dance floor, reasonably-priced drinks and great music, this is the place for the classier and more mature patron that is sick and tired of mixing it up with the children who attend clubs closer to the downtown core. My only complaint is that the dance floor is rarely used for dancing but even that can change depend on the nature of the crowd. Highly recommended as an escape from the usual Toronto nightlife scene."}
{"text":"Like a home away from home.

Admittedly, my friends and I showed up off-peak, so we had a lot of interaction with the bar staff which made the visit a little different than the usual experience.

Not only were the bar staff friendly, but they had kick-ass taste in music. Everything from classic rock to indie to R & B and that's something I've been desperate to find. 

This is a credible, grungy R n R bar: lots of memorabelia on the walls - everything from paintings, to photos to real guitars above the bar and it's a JD haven. 

We stuck to domestic pints which were a bargain at $5 tax in. PBRs came in a mason jar and that made me a little misty.

Get there early on the weekend if you want avoid the line-ups.

My only beef: this bar isn't in my hood."}
{"text":"Went there last night/ Place was actually really cool! 

Positives: Really great atmosphere to the bar. No douchey people or anything.
-Drinks were really cheap I think it was $16 for a Rum/Coke + 2 domestic beers.
-Bartenders were quick/attentive although there weren't a whole lot of them
-Cover was only $5

Cons: Guy made us stand outside in the rain while there was no line and apparently the bouncer said to my friend \"You're gonna have to wait for a minute cuz we want to get the line a little longer here\" which is pretty much the most ABSURD statement ever.
-Music was all over the map, but not really in a good way. Some of it was ok though. Kind of a mix between rock/pop with a mix of hip/hop."}
{"text":"Some of the reviews I read had people all steamed that this place was trying to replicate NY. Not true, The owners just decided on the name...so settle down everyone.

I was there twice last week, upstairs being a little more party and downstairs being way more chill. Regardless whether up or down the staff is on it.

Enjoy"}
{"text":"This place is so lame. The staff try to over charge your bill if they think you've had a few. They are the worst."}
{"text":"it was a quiet Friday night and the bar back knew.  He came around giving everyone a free shot on the house for the quiet night...customer service gave this a 5.  Thanks to the Asian dude, cheers to you."}
{"text":"A really disinteresting and overpriced bar that offers nothing new in Toronto's crowded nightlife. Coatcheck usually fils up by 11 pm so you're left carrying your jacket around the tiny dancefloor. The cretins who are regulars here are also quite insufferable. 2 stars for halfway decent bartending."}
{"text":"Sorry, not my thing.  Was only here for 10 minutes at around 1am on a Saturday night, but here was my impression:

If you want to go to a bar with 3-to-1 dudes who like to bump into you repeatedly without apologizing for knocking into you, go here.

As a bonus, all the girls here seem pretty attainable.

Had a better time at The Drake."}
{"text":"Brooklynn Bar was my first experience going out in downtown Toronto and it was such a blast! It is a big rustic bar. Two levels with lots of pictures and art work on the walls. It's definitely a place where you want to go with a group of friends and family. Good drinks and service. Cool ambiance and a fun selection of music playing. Made for a fun night out. The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was the cover at the door. Paying to get into a bar is always so weird to me and should never really happen unless it's after a certain hour and my friends from Toronto that took me there were actually surprised that there was a cover so that was the only downer. Other than that Brooklynn Bar is a good time and really fun!"}
{"text":"I'm being generous because I haven't had the food at Brooklyn yet.  The first time I went to Brooklyn, a friend was hosting an open mic, with musicians set up in the front of the place near the stairs to the bathroom.  The musicians were great, but the majority of the crowd just talked right over it, and half of them didn't even know there was a performance going on.  To be fair, Brooklyn isn't set up for music, even though the owners would like to think so (as I've read from articles pre-opening), and their concept for the bar is supposed to have come from classic rock.  I hadn't been back to Brooklyn since the fall, but went back a couple nights ago and noticed a few more rock-ish elements had been added.  Still, it has a long way to go if they want to survive the hipster strip.  It's missing the authenticity.

It's a narrow space, with gorgeous high ceilings, and great lighting, except for the blue-ish Christmas lights that adorn the back booth space.  The bartenders are wonderfully friendly, and the draught selection is very original.  It's a great place to grab a drink by yourself.  You can always count on the bartender to welcome you like you're a regular.  

They have a great downstairs room, which I would like to see utilized more.  Maybe, move the live music down there?  Make it a super-intimate, couch-chillin' sort of jam/performance space.  Otherwise, I love the warmth of the place, and the owners/staff.  I keep meaning to get there for Sunday brunch.  Would love to hear others' experiences."}
{"text":"I ventured to Toronto to see some old university friends of mine and they chose to go to Brooklynn for our night out. We had guest list and made it in line before the cut off. No one else was waiting outside but they made us wait for a little bit. I'm assuming they wanted to build up a line but I cannot be sure. 

The inside is pretty cool but fairly tight. Our group took over one side of the bar completely and it was very difficult to navigate through the place to get to the other side. The dance floor was a sardine can. The music was REALLY good though. I wish there was a place like this in London. Older vibe, house music mixed with older top 40, non club feel. It was refreshing. The prices were on par to what I would pay in London too so that was a huge plus for me!

I found out the downstairs area is more open so I went down there for a while. It was easier to talk to people but the music was still playing through the speakers which was nice. 

The staff here are fairly attentive and the bartenders were cute! There are various booths to sit at and bouncers wont come over and kick you out if it isn't reserved for bottle service (if they have that, I'm not sure). 

I had a good time here but I really love to dance and the dance floor was just way too small. I would let others know about it to try it out though!"}
{"text":"Grimy, grimy venue. Brooklyn bar is trying to have a cool \"basement party\" feel but it's actually like a once flooded basement that they tried mopping with a dirty shovel. It's very unkept and dirty. Broken glass scattered all over the dance floor and booths, smelly, water downed drinks. To top it off, as we were leaving we witnessed one of the bouncers make a unnecessarily rude comment to one of the girls by the coat check.. calling her a \"dirty hoodrat\". If you want a good time just take a 1min walk to the drake and avoid this dump all together."}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday and had a good time.  Downstairs has darts and live music in an atmosphere that is relaxed and easy for conversation.  The staff was friendly and the guy hosting the live music took requests and even let us get up to sing.  Fun spot."}
