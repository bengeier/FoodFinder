{"text":"This remains the only time I threw out an entire dinner. We ordered 3 dishes and couldn't tell what was what. Sloppy, soggy messes each of them, one with some chewy meat inside. Not surprised they have shut down."}
{"text":"This place is adorable, and the food is fantastic! I so enjoy little taquerias where you can directly compliment the person who made your food. There may not be many tables here, but there is plenty of flavor. I've posted a photo of the menu - good value for fresh food.   I chose three different tacos today: Barbacoa, steak, and carnitas. My intention was to have one and take the rest home for lunch tomorrow...but I couldn't stop at just one...I ate all three and they were delightful. Oh, must have more of their house habañero sauce...  I was so tempted to try the Pastel con très leches for dessert, but I've decided that it will have to wait until my next visit. There is no doubt that I will be back, with friends. Perhaps it's dangerous that it isn't that far from where I live, but now I know that I don't have to travel to the NE to get a great taco.  Don't just pass them by, stop in and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Closed. Loved this place but closed a couple months ago. Said they would move onto fourth nw but haven't found them yet. Definitely miss them."}
