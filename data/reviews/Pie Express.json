{"text":"Super affordable (cheaper than other on campus), great pizza, nice atmosphere. Also very generous with toppings! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you don't need frills, this is your jam. Yes it's in a basement, sure they are out of most flavors of soda sometimes... but the PIZZA!!! 12\" of a crispy chewy crust with unlimited toppings, cooked in around 3 minutes. Can't be beat! They also do salads and subs for the same price, unlimited toppings. I like to play around with different sauce and topping combinations, haven't disliked any yet. The staff is friendly and fast. My coworker managed to get 11 toppings.. can you beat that?"}
{"text":"BEST PRICE FOR MAKE YOUR OWN PIZZA IN OAKLAND and good quality! Need I say more? Tasty pizza that's quick and made to order - with unlimited toppings. $5.50 for a 12\" personal pizza. Comparable to Lotsa but the better of the two. Try it!! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Not a gourmet pizza, but certainly better than some more expensive places around. Prices are more than fair, and you don't have to wait long even if they're busy. I got a red sauce, mozzarella, mushroom, and spinach pie. Usually toppings cost extra especially if you get more than one. Not here! Go here if you want a quick cheap delicious customized pizza with a generous coating of cheese and without the pretentious attitude some places have.

It is kind of weird going down the staircase. I'm assuming you could still order to go and have them bring it out to you on the sidewalk if you can't walk down the stairs."}
{"text":"WHOA NOW. A customized pizza for just under $6?!

Look for those orange signs that aren't so pretty looking and walk down the stairs to the hidden gem of Pizza Underground.. There are no windows down here and it can definitely feel stuffy. My last visit, there was a kind of an unpleasant smokey smell.

I've only got the pizza here, just an FYI! Can't say anything for the salads yet.

BYO PIZZA ($5.50): UNLIMITED TOPPINGS! You start with your sauce, theres various types like red, buffalo, pesto, olive oil, etc. I got minced garlic and spicy red as my sauce (wasn't spicy tho). Then proceeded with classic mozzarella (they have lots of other cheese choices too). Oh my word, the toppings galore. The chicken looks a bit dry and in chunks/shreds. I got chicken, Canadian bacon, green peppers, red onions and spinach. Then to the additional topping section after the cashier you choose from garlic powder, sriracha, red pepper flakes, etc.

A complaint I have is that I wish the jalape√±os were fresh, they looked like the pickled straight out of the jar kind :(. So I just bombed my pizza with red pepper flakes and sriracha to give mine some kick. ALSO the guy uses the same pizza cutter for everyone's pizza so my friend got an unwanted olive on her pizza, LOL.

I will be back at Pie Express for sure! There are so many different combinations and service is decent, pizza comes out fast. They're open really late too on most days!"}
{"text":"This is not the greatest pizza joint in Oakland, but you cannot beat it for the price. $5.50 for a customized 12' pizza is unbeatable, and the quality is almost as good as Lotsa Stone Fired Pizza, but at a tremendously lower price point. The staff are incredibly friendly, and the it is a chill environment - great for socializing.  

What is also nice about this place is that, unlike other \"build your own\" pizza places, they do not limit you to a particular number of sauces or toppings - you can really experiment with the options and what the base price covers. 

I did not try their subs or salads but they are also reasonably priced. I will update this review if I do try them. 

The only drawback of this location is accessibility - it is underground, down a flight of stairs."}
{"text":"Needs to be advertised more!! It's definitely worth giving it a try, the price is amazing for UNLIMITED toppings. There are multiple spreads/sauces you can put on the pizza, different choices of cheese, and a lot of different proteins to choose from and vegetables, all of which are good quality (of course nothing gourmet). The crust is on the thin side, which I prefer, but it's both crispy and chewy. The service is great and you can watch your pizza being cooked right in front of you, which only takes 5-10 minutes. You can dine in or take out which is also great! Overall, I recommend this place to all pizza lovers (and non pizza lovers) who are looking to get a personal pizza for less than $10!"}
{"text":"Honestly doubt this place would pass a health inspection. I went when it just opened at 11, so it should have been pretty clean, yet it was disgusting. Food all over the place and it looked like they hadn't cleaned the floor the night before. I wanted a salad because the price was amazing...$5.50 or something like that for unlimited add ins, but they didn't have much salad appropriate add ins at all. Not even basics like cucumber and carrots. I didn't wind up eating the salad because the spinach looked wet, so I was worried it had gone bad, and I would not trust this place. 

For perspective there's your hole in the wall no thrills joints with amazing food that might be a little sketchy and then there's places that are straight up filthy like this one. Maybe the pizza is good and cheap, but it's not worth risking food poisoning. And with the low shelf of vegetables, I wasn't going to risk eating a salad from this place. I will say the employees were nice but that doesn't make up for the state of the inside."}
{"text":"Unlimited topping pizza for ~$5. A great joint in Oakland. 

As others pointed out, the atmosphere isn't the best, and they're often missing toppings, but for a quick (or late night) bite, this can't be beat."}
{"text":"Wow. 5 DOLLAR PIZZAS?

This place really is the epitome of a hole in the wall.

Tucked away in the basement of a corner entrance, using soda cases as doorstops, and a cheesy Garfield figurine, Pie Express really surprises with its food.

Their pizzas are customizable, and best of all, they have unlimited toppings. Talk about letting the customers have their way.

The pizza crust is thin, but really chewy and tasty. They are generous about cheese if you ask for it, and it's really a treat. The spicy sauces aren't that spicy, but you can still get a good pizza without the heat. The cooking method is a conveyor belt through a small pizza oven, which gives an interesting crispy feel to many of the toppings.

The staff are funny and super nice people, which makes the experience all the better.

Great pizza, awesome staff, good vibes."}
{"text":"OVERALL: cheap, tasty pizza with unlimited toppings. Environment isn't the greatest but service is always friendly. Super budget-friendly!

When this place first opened up, I was a bit hesitant to go because the entrance didn't look too promising. You have to go through a door and walk down a flight of stairs before you get to the actual entrance. However, after that, you're greeted by the aroma of freshly made pizza with very cheap prices. I'm glad I found this place, because WOW - you really can't beat the price. 

You can choose a variety of pizza bases, including gluten free. There are also other options for sauce. After that, you can choose as many toppings as you want, and they definitely don't skimp on the toppings. There are many meats, such as pepperoni, salami, sausage, etc. You can also get unlimited vegetables. After that, they bake your pizza in the oven, and it comes out pretty quickly - still piping hot though! 

I'm very glad this place opened up in Oakland, because I'll definitely be going back in the future."}
{"text":"Pie express is a standard build your own pizza shop. Unlike lotsa pizza down the street, it really allows you to have unlimited toppings on your pie. During the opening week its $5.50 for you 12\" pizza. It is a basement restaurant, and the layout is weird, but for the price you really can't beat it. It really wasn't busy when I went, but there are only two employees, so during busier times I would imagine the wait to be longer. Since the entrance is on the side of the building, it may be a bit difficult to find, but if you can get over the Garfield statue in the window and signs that have no color coordination, its a cheap meal that's decent."}
{"text":"Service was fair.
Food was good
Great value. 
Not too busy! Good experience overall, especially for a quick bite after long studying"}
{"text":"The sign outside advertised a \"48 oz salad\" for $5.50. When you go inside it says it's $7.65 for salad with no discussion of weight. I ordered a salad, which was difficult because they barely had any of the listed toppings on them menu. When I got it home, it was only 26 oz..... I mean, that's still a huge salad, but don't advertise something you can't deliver!"}
{"text":"Super fast, super cheap, unlimited toppings and they're fresh. Crust is crispy but still doughy enough. Great lunch option."}
{"text":"Unlimited toppings, great price, best pizza in Oakland! Seriously going anywhere else is a waste of money. It might be hard to find but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped by here today after hearing about the special that they are having for this week: 10/30-11/5. $5.50 for a 12\" pizza with unlimited toppings!! LEGIT unlimited! The entrance to the area is a little weird because after you get through the front door, it's just a shady staircase down, but once you get down there, it's pretty nice!! It's clean and spacious, which is enough for me. The staff were all super nice and patient with me and my friend as they explained the whole process to us. And the pizza really does cook THAT fast!! I don't know if it's three minutes but it's definitely faster than you'd expect.

The pizza was cooked perfectly: not burnt at all and the crust was still crispy and held its shape underneath all the toppings that we got! I will definitely be coming here more often. Super polite service and good tasting food!"}
