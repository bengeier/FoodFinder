{"text":"This place is a gem and y'all better recognize. Juice game is tight and cheap AF. Those sammies hit the spot. This is BY FAR the cheapest fresh juice option in town. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place may look a little sketch but the two things I have tried here were amazing. 1) Fresh juice - they'll juice any combo of fruits and veggies right before your eyes for $4-6. 2) Bahn mi - delicious Vietnamese sub on a super fresh baguette for $3.50! Best deal in Toronto, hands down."}
{"text":"one of my all-time favourites delicious substantial banh for 3.50. i eat here like 3 times a week, maybe more. also, unlike many other places i like or have liked a lot in the past because of good food for decent value, i've never had any stomach issues after eating here. they are very generous with the amount of veggies they put in the banh. owners are super friendly !"}
{"text":"Another awesome little gem in the neighbourhood! The smoothies are fresh and not overly sweet, as they use pure cane sugar. The chicken banh mi tastes light and fresh, and the veggies have the perfect crunch. They're quick and efficient and the prices are great! A smoothie and banh mi cost only $8!"}
{"text":"YES!!!! Best of Bloordale. Only place in town you can get a huge 24 oz fruit and veggie juice pressed right before your eyes for around $5!!!! House special: carrot, beet, apple, lemon, ginger. They'll do any combo you want, just ask.   The owners are super hard workers and go out of their way to be sweet. I love them. Tip them well!  As for food -- FANTASTIC and CHEAP. My regular is the $3.50 banh mi with marinated tofu AND fried egg. Do not delay, just step right up to their cute North-facing windows on Bloor and Emerson."}
