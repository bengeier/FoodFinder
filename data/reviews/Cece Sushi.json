{"text":"A new grab 'n go sushi shop. Regular price: $3.99 for small boxes, 5.99 for large. Grand opening special, 40% off. Just opened this week so not too much variety yet but regular prices are better than other sushi joints. Quality is good so far from what I can tell. The ratio of rice to fish is fair. It's too early to make any concluding thoughts but will be back to get a quick bite."}
{"text":"I get affordable & decent ready-made sushi practically at my doorstep, a wide variety to choose from almost every time I visit & it keeps me away from the McDonald's next door. This could be dangerous (i.e. addictive). I've been back here pretty frequently. Also, the service is courteous & the owner is a very nice lady. I wish her well."}
{"text":"Good place if you are looking for cheap sushi and have a craving.   The prices are great just take out."}
{"text":"Really convenient sushi location located in a plaza at sheppard and warden. If you're craving sushi this is the place to go, but it's not the freshest sushi, so don't have high expectations. Prices are fair considering it's a low key sushi shop."}
{"text":"This is a Takeout only Sushi place, it is of course designed to be a quick grab and go type of sushi place. like Mac Sushi at the malls. Unlike Mac Sushi, their sushi combos are affordable and not overly expensive. i can say their normal pries are still better then Mac Sushi's end of day sale.   Although the price is better, the food quality is pretty much the same. Much like Mac sushi, the sushi isn't really the most fresh or the best.   i ordered 2 boxes of sushi, and the first one the Yellow Dragon Roll, which consisted of Salmon on top with tempura and avocado. The mix is not an issue, however it is the tempura, one taste into it, and you can tell that the tempura was fried with oil that is severely used. as it has the taste of that old oil on it and the smell of it. my suggestion would be, if your not going to change the oil daily to fry the tempura to use for this just avoid using tempura at all and stick to fish.   the Mini Salmon Roll, it is serviceable for the price, the salmon was average and serviceable. The fish is decent, and the price is very cheap.   Overall the owner is friendly, and the prices are very much on the cheaper scale, so if you want cheap take out sushi, this place is suggested. However overall, it is by far not one of the better take out sushi places i've been to. i highly doubt i will be back for more in this place."}
{"text":"Affordable take out sushi, don't let the price fool you!   The sushi here have better quality than most sushi joints in Toronto. Probably the best sushi in Scarborough.  I come here once a week!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a chance.  I ordered from them probably 4 times and the stuff just doesn't taste good.  The rice that they use for their sushi roll is badly cooked.  The rice colour is greyish and it doesn't taste or look like good quality sushi rice.   I will not come here again."}
{"text":"Good place if you are really craving sushi.  The owners are very friendly and the sushi is good for the price you pay.  They may not have a lot displayed but when you go in but they are willing to take request if you are really craving something =)"}
