{"text":"0 STARS from me for this place. .Found a piece of chicken in the Achari aloo. Enough to put off my Family, who are all vegetarians.The owner still had the audacity to charge us for all the other entrees ordered by us. Simply awful service and unhygenic cooking conditions  If you are a vegetarian AVOID this place at all costs!!!"}
{"text":"We had some friends coming over from RI who were craving for authentic Indian cuisine and so based on the yelp reviews we took them to the Dhaba! And we were not disappointed. The ambiance is very acceptable. They've managed to recreate a mildly Indian atmosphere in there. We went along with our vegetarian friends and stuck to a veggie diet. The bhel puri wasn't that great, however the samosa chat more than made up for it. The garlic naan as many of the other reviews point out, was simply surreal. The same could be said of the paneer tikka masala and the kofta. The food was really good.  Now, for the put offs:  1. With just one other table occupied in the restaurant and us having given our orders in advance, it took 20 good minutes for the food to arrive. And that too, after the other table was served.  2. The lovely young lady who welcomed us, showed us our seats and took our orders had a terrible scowl writ all over her face. She never once did smile, was very curt and generally had the air of someone who was waiting on a bunch of people who had invaded her house, uninvited. Despite the food and the ambiance and the wait time, the one thing which we all kept going back to weeks after our visit to the Dhaba, was how dispirited and unwelcoming the lady was.  Bottom line verdict: Good food, Good ambiance, Not really welcoming."}
{"text":"If I have an option to remove that one star I would have done that, The lady who works there is so arrogant, we never go back to that place. Beware if you go with the http://restaurant.c... coupon they will rip you apart more. They want to count a two year child and asked us to order as many dishes for as many guests to use coupon. On top she doesn't want to serve the complimentary tea just because we used the coupon. She ordered her waiter to take the tea back, when he is about to serve.  You still want to go this place? Best of luck"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Tempe and I tried most places. Friendly service, clean and when you ask for spicy they give you spicy unlike some other places where they determine the spice level it should be by your ethnicity."}
{"text":"this is the best most flavorful restaurant in town ! All the dishes are made with quality and care and are consistently good every time. The owners are always there and very kind. A great dining experience every time!!"}
{"text":"Nice place inside.   Food prices range from $6 appetizers to $15 entrees.  Flying horse large beer $8.   Food was 10/10 Atmosphere (young couples) 9/10 Music 0/10 --- play some music for god sake...   Overall 7.8/10 .. If they had music and some free papad to start with. I would of given them 10/10.  Still .. Buy the GROUPON and go during the week!"}
{"text":"I am traveling for work, and wanted to check out a local place.  This got good reviews in yelp, so I went.   First, the parking.  The parking in front was tiny.  I had to park behind the building and walk around to the front.  Not a big deal, during the day.  But at night, a little sketchy.  For the safety of the customers, there should be a safer entry from the back parking lot, OR fix the parking in the front.   Next, the service.  Service was poor.  I was barely talked to - three times to be exact.  Once, when the waiter took my order and then again to drop off my check.  He literally talked to me twice, and neither of those times was to ask if my food was ok, etc.  There was someone who was dropping off the food to the tables.  She literally dropped my food off and then left.  She talked to me  a bit later (third and final time), but only because she had to.  I flagged her down to tell her that my Roti was wrong (who puts butter on Roti?).  But that's not all... even after my Roti issue was resolved, I realized that my dinner (Dil Bahar Korma?) was wrong.  But since my server never came back, I couldn't tell him, and I couldn't get his attention. I thought about trying to explain to the girl who fixed my Roti, but the truth was that I was so hungry and annoyed, that I just ate it. AND IT WAS REALLY GOOD.  No doubt.  But again, not what I ordered.  Now, the cost.  I paid $15 for a vegetarian dish (2-2.5 cups total with sauce/veg) and maybe 2 cups rice.  Other places I have been to you get more than that and for less than the cost here.  $2-3 for Roti?  $3 is a bit high, but whatever.  A side of Raita is $5?  How about $2.5-3?  Finally, I have to comment on my appetizer (Rehriwale Dahi Bhalle?  it wasn't clearly noted on the receipt).  I wanted a pakora appetizer, but the waiter told me about a delicious croquette thing.  Sounded interesting, so I got it.  When it arrived, the dish looked like an ice cream sundae with chickpeas.  There was something at the bottom of the bowl, presumably the croquette, but it was drowning in so much sauce (yogurt sauce, tamarind chutney, mint sauce) and chickpeas, I really couldn't tell.  Honestly, the presentation was unappetizing and it was odd trying to eat something that I couldn't see...  It did taste pretty good, though, but not good enough for a $8 price tag.     I want to emphasize that the food was very tasty - kudos to the chef.  But the service was awful - rude, even.  And the prices are just too high for what you actually get.  I'd be less upset with the prices if I had more food to come home with."}
{"text":"The wait time was at a least 45 mins for two people. Food was fairly expensive, compared to other similar restaurants close by. You definitely pay more for the ambience. However the owners who take the orders were friendly and courteous. The grocery store and Indian accessory store next door are quite an experience to browse through."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant based on the reviews on yelp with a Groupon.  I had high expectations, but I was disappointed and here is why:  - The service was VERY slow (this is not the reason for my one star because understandably it was a Groupon night and it was quite busy)  - The food was tasteless when we asked for spicy.  One of the appetizers we ordered was Paneer Tikka and it was extremely bland - not marinated at all, hard, dry and did not taste like Paneer Tikka.  We ordered two curries for our main course and had same problem again, it didn't taste like the items we ordered.    - Worst of all - a roach crawled below our table and one of the guys from the table adjacent to us decided to squish it right there.  It sat there the entire time we were there - eating our meal - a couple of steps away.  The restaurant didn't bother to clean it even after the table emptied out.  I don't think I will be going back here.  May be I have high/different expectations due to the fact that I have enjoyed some really awesome Indian food in the east coast and also because I am Indian.  May be the restaurant targets non-Indian crowd with a bit milder/suddle taste - even then, if the food is absolutely bland, when you ask for spicy, it is NOT Indian food.   Hope this was helpful and if you do end up going here, I hope you have a better experience!"}
{"text":"This place is Amazerling as the kids say...  This is my #1 choice thus far for Indian cuisine. The Naan is sooooo good and all dishes have fantastic sauces. I'm was pleasantly surprised that they also serve baby coconut water in the coconut... Really great place A++"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I was expecting too much and got caught up in all the hype surrounding this place, but I have to say...meh.  I've experienced better.  The taste of the food wasn't anything that left me saying, I MUST return here!  I can't even remember what kind of curry I ordered, but it didn't come with rice, so there was an extra charge.  Bummer.  My friends ordered dhaba thalis, which is kind of a sampler dish, and I'll give credit to The Dhaba for loading the food on there.  Perhaps that's the way to go here.  The service was also not impressive.  It wasn't bad, but it was just...slow?  The girl who was our waitress kept coming back to our table without food to tell us the status of our food and that it was going to be delayed.  I suppose that's a courteous gesture, but at some point, I got to thinking, Just come back when you have food.    Though I'm giving The Dhaba only 2 stars, I give their mango lassi and their decor 3 stars.  Check it out.  Overall, I found this place decent enough, but I've had better."}
{"text":"Wow!  My wife and I have been going all around Scottsdale & Tempe sampling different Indian food, and The Dhaba is our new favorite!  The onion pakora were seasoned and spiced perfectly. Lamb kofta was great, the meat was super tender.  We ordered \"medium\" spice level, but it seemed pretty mild to us.  Spice level is all relative of course, just sayin'.  It's a pretty small place, we didn't have reservations (Saturday night at 8pm-ish) and waited about 20 minutes.  Not bad at all, but it was just 2 of   us, so if you have larger party be sure and call ahead.  Food service was quick."}
{"text":"Not worth the hike. It was average... We even had flies flying  freely over food.  Samosa chat was like dahi puri. Medium spicy was sweet here. I threw up after having mango Lassi. Wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best tasting Indian food I have ate in a long time.  Good environment and great service.  The metal plates and cups add another quaint home feel to a nicely decorated authentically planned restaurant."}
{"text":"Saturday night, no reservations, place was busy, but they sat us immediatly!   We frequent several Indian Restarant in the valley and have traveled in India fairly extensivly.  The food was beautiful!  Nicely prepared, absolutely delish.  First rate!  Service was outstanding!   There is a little grocery store next door and we stocked up on some of our favorite foods while there.  They had some of the Indian pastries that I love but rarely can find.  The owner of the grocery store and the restarant was manning the cash register.  He was extremly kind and helpful.    Go there, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love eating at this restaurant. small place but great ambiance and awesome food."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Indian restaurant in the area.  I've been there many times and have never been disappointed.  It's sometimes difficult to get a table but it's Definitely is worth the wait"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place, and the food is always exceptional!! The only thing that can lack on occasion, is the service.  One of our favorite places for Indian food."}
{"text":"Although the food is delicious, as always, we were upset to be told after the meal that because we made a reservation we could not use our groupon on dinner.  In general, that does not make sense. We can only use groupons if we are walk-ins? This is a groupon that expires in two days and we will not be able to get the value out of it now. I feel that a business should honor the deals they offer and/or make any caveats known up front."}
{"text":"Extremely rude service. Yelp says it's open until 9:30 pm. We arrived at 8:30 pm, but was told very rudely it's already closed! Even if it was closed, it could be said in a much nicer way."}
{"text":"i chose this place and took 3 other people with me, and WOW was i embarassed about picking this place. none of us were happy, in fact we were all pretty unhappy. the business owner/manager wasn't the best with customer service nor communication. the appetizer was okay but then all of the entrees were .... well, gross. we hardly touched our food. the owner seemed irked when she saw our plates full and made things very uncomfortable. if you want delicious indian in a pleasant environment, this is NOT it.  :("}
{"text":"Our daughter wanted to take us here because of her many good dines at this restaurant.  My husband and I are new to Indian cuisine.  The woman who greeted us and took our order was so pleasant and kind and answered our many questions.  I must eat gluten free; most of the items on the menu were marked gluten free, and the woman was knowledgeable as well.  Our water glasses were kept full and the staff made themselves available without being annoying.  We tried four different things and were each happy with what we ordered. Out of deference to us \"newbies\", we all ordered our dishes mild on the heat scale, and the dishes were well balanced and flavorful even without any heat. Our daughter, who normally orders 7 here on a scale to 10, agreed that they were delicious even mild."}
{"text":"I was surprised by how little I enjoyed the food at the Dhaba. The food was mediocre compared to other local Indian restaurants and the prices were more expensive. I will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Dhaba is amazing! The Chicken Tikka is delish! I've gone 3 times with an Indian friend who also says it's some of the best she's had in the Valley. The place is charming and food is great. They offer a lot of deals on different sites (restaurant.com & groupon-like sites, so look for them!) Yum Yum!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my husband on a weekend night, with a reservation. We were seated at a table near the front which wasn't the greatest - right next to the hostess stand and by the door to the connected shop next door. So guests and staff were going through the door right next to me throughout our meal. If you're seated there I would recommend asking for a different table! Service was a little bit slow, took 10-15 minutes until our order was taken. Water glasses were refilled regularly. We enjoyed the vege appetizer platter, but unfortunately it really filled us up and we didn't have much appetite for the mains. The spice level in my main was disappointing. We were asked on ordering - I asked for a 7, assuming that a 10 would be very hot, and a 7 would be about a medium-hot. My '7' malai kofta was very mild, and my husband's aloo ghobi (also a '7') was really lacking in flavor and spice, extremely mild. The garlic naan was very good. We ended up boxing the rest of our mains to take home, it tasted better the next day.  Overall experience okay, but just a little disappointing, perhaps since we'd seen the reviews on here were so good! Probably won't come back here again."}
{"text":"Meh food. Overpriced and inauthentic. You can find cheaper and higher quality food elsewhere--the restaurant simply didn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. The food was good however what lacked was the service. I'm glad I got an appetizer because the food took almost 30 minutes. Also, the servers just tend to their own things rather then asking the customers if they need anything. I found myself getting up to ask for things.   Giving it a 3 stars only because of the service. Otherwise the food is good. Would recommend It to others."}
{"text":"Foot was excellent but the place is expensive. We ordered Tandoori shrimp, Malai Kofta and Okra. All things were well prepared and authentic."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night for my 2nd visit; and it was as good as the first.  I ordered the Chicken Tikka Massala which was exceptional and others in our party ordered the Tandoori Chicken and the Curry Chicken.  Both people reported that the taste was excellent and served very hot.  The service was very good and the food was delivered promptly.  With the three entrees, we also ordered 3 orders of rice, 2 orders of garlic Naan and a couple of soft drinks.  The bill came to around $70 which I thought was a fair price.  As an extra bonus, there was a Sitar player providing wonderful ambiance.  Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Its just a ok place. Nothing special and nothing authentic for sure the way they advertise in the menu. Pricy too."}
{"text":"Great Indian food restaurant.  We tried it for the first time the other night.  I was skeptical because only one of the employees walking in was actually Indian, but the walls evidenced that they had been written up in the newspaper several times so we stayed to see what the fuss was about.  The food was delicious, and if could remember or even spell what we ordered, I would include it in my review.  They brought out a crispy, flat bread with three different sauces that we both enjoyed.  Then an appetizer of Indian style chicken wings, and I ordered a chicken dish recommended by our waitress.  Everything was delicious, and of course, spicy.  Dhaba dhaba dhaba dhaba, dhaba-you B!"}
{"text":"I bought the $25 for $50 groupon for this place so we headed over on a Saturday night. We were warned that they were busy, but they found us a reservation at 8pm. We got there at 8, but didn't get seated until 8:50, (they only have 9 or so tables, so they were turning people away left and right as we were waiting). We didn't get our food until 9:30-- I was starving at that point. The food here was very good and the service was friendly.  I would recommend this place if you're prepared to wait quite awhile after your reservation. For us, there are so many Indian places nearby without the wait, we're not planning to come back."}
{"text":"I can't speak the Dhaba's praises enough.  The food is outstanding, the service is great, the ambiance is warm and welcoming.    We went for dinner on Sunday, making reservations on-line.  When we walked in, our table was ready with glasses of water filled and papadums and chutneys waiting for us.  We were greeted quickly, drink orders taken (my girlfriend loves their hot chai).   They didn't hover around the table while we were deciding, as it generally takes a while to go through their extensive menu.  It's a nice, subtle reminder that they appreciate your business AND want you to enjoy yourself.    We ordered a spinach and chickpea curry and a spicy lamb curry with mangoes and capsicum, with a side of garlic naan.  All delicious (I normally get the chicken vindaloo but decided to try something a little bit different). The naan is fantastic, I also have had the chili naan and it's an excellent compliment, if you want to keep piling the spice on (and I do).   We ended the meal with gulab jamun, perfect for two people.     We never go away from the Dhaba hungry, we're always satisfied, and we always recommend it to our friends.  It's hands down my favorite restaurant in the Valley."}
{"text":"Ok food. We ordered one order of lentils and 2 veggies, the naan basket and it came with rice. The lentils were supposed to be Dal Makhani, but, didn't see any cream in the order, and it was too garlicky. The veggies were Baigan Bartha and the Cauliflower and potatoes. Found a couple of undercooked potatoes in our order. The naan basket was excellent. One of them was stuffed with potatoes, and had a nice spiciness to it."}
{"text":"For a student like me who is away from home, does not like to cook and has limited money, dhaba is the best place to eat. Their afternoon meals are just perfect for students. Fits the pocket, fills the stomach and the food is amazing. I love their mutton dishes, they are very well prepared and are mouth watering. hmm my mouth is already watering..lol"}
{"text":"This is a OK indian restaurant.  Very cute place, cozy and nice. I do like their decoration and ambient.  In term of food, I must say I had better indian food before. Order one chaat (street snack) and two curry dishes, one goat , one spinach chicken. They were good but a little lack in term of favor ...  I think it is cater toward American taste. I didn't see any desi people in this place other than my friend ... this is certainly a sign of its authenticity  Also their naan has too much butter on it ... not exactly my taste  Service is a bit on the slow side but overall good.  Nice stop if you are close to the area but if you want better chaat, try little india.  Or some good indian food, try indian paradise (north valley) Don't forget to check in on yelp, they have check-in offer.  I got a free dessert of kheer (rice pudding)"}
{"text":"Food was very tasty and portions were great if you were hungry. The menu was extremely long and involved. Accommodated our group of 20 people wonderfully. Restaurant is fairly small. Staff were attentive and polite. I would go again!"}
{"text":"Great food, good ambiance but the place is a bit small."}
{"text":"Got there at 8:30pm on a Saturday night and was told that they only had 2 cooks and a large party to attend to so they would not be able to serve us! First time - Never again!!"}
{"text":"Since I haven't eaten a lot of Indian food I opted for the Maharaja Patiala Tandoori Thali which included tandoori chicken, tandoori tikka, lamb curry, lentils, biryani (rice), house salad, raita, chutney, papad, chai and dessert.  The lamb was the highlight of the meal.  The sauce it was in was  delicious.  For me it was the right amount of spice without being too hot.  The naan was also full of flavor either alone or dipped in the remaining lamb sauce or raita.   Unfortunately the chicken was too dry so I didn't eat much of it.  The rest of the included food was good but not exceptional.   I would go here again but next time I will stick to lamb and naan."}
{"text":"Searched for decent Indian food after moving back to Phoenix from NYC many years ago.  Finally found it at The Dhaba.  Service is generally good, although the place is small and can be a bit overwhelmed at times when large parties from Mesa come in with groupons - at least they are not allowed to open carry to dinner anymore.  The same can be said of the ambiance.  Maybe a little expensive, which is the only reason for four instead of five stars."}
{"text":"The best Indian food in Arizona. The rice is so fragrant and rich! The okra is amazing! The hospitality is great! I feel as if I am in India, the serviceware is all authentic . Best variety of food here! I literally crave the rice and okra from Dhaba!"}
{"text":"I saw a group-on and decided to give it a try since I love Indian food.  One of the owners (I believe) was waiting on my table and she was verrrry nice and made the experience that much better.  The food was the best I have had lately...and like everyone says, you have to try the Garlic Naan.  I couldn't believe their $3 \"domestic\" beers included local breweries (I got hop shock).  I did make a reservation and our table was ready for us even though we arrived 10 minutes early.  I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"First up, certainly not the best Indian food in the city. Having said that, not bad either if you are in the vicinity. I'm obviously picky about this cuisine as its native to me but I also know I won't get close to tasty food here. Having said that, it's good if you want to try Indian food. I had the chaat, not authentic but refreshing. Little India in Tempe has better flavor. For the main course had the saag murgh ( spinach chicken) and goat curry. The goat was better. The dessert however was quite good. Got the Kheer ( rice pudding) which was very flavorful. The ambience is nice, the service a little slow but the staff quite friendly but not sure how well they know their stuff.  You won't be disappointed by your experience but you won't come back blown away either."}
{"text":"This place needs a review by an Indian who can really critique the Indian cooking nuances. I have visited the dhaba over 5 times with friends or my wife, and every time I have felt the food could taste better or I could cook better than that. Food is good if you aren't Indian.  The food is definitely way too over-priced, so is the grocery store next to it, both have the same owner. Recently I went into the restaurant and saw the Indian receptionist girl treating Americans and Indians differently, guess they don't want Indian people coming to their businesses.  My biggest complaint - the kitchen closes at 9:15pm (even on weekends), and they don't let you in after 9pm unless you have a reservation."}
{"text":"Tasty food, but for the price you're paying, there isn't much of it.  We counted (yes, actually counted) only 6 little chunks of chicken in our tika masala, which cost $13.  Naan is delicious and the korma is fantastic, but again, I'm not particularly fond of eating sauce over rice for dinner.   We have seen lots of folks get turned away without reservations, so I would be sure and call ahead.  I don't think we'll be heading back - found Jewel of the Crown in Old Town and they blow this place out of the water. Cute Indian market and cafe attached to restaurant in the same plaza are worth checking out."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. I feel it's costlier than all other Indian restaurants in town. Food was heavy and I had to take a box while returning."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian food. I am originally from the UK, where you can get amazing Indian in virtually every city, town and village!  Here in the US, not so much. Its hard to find Indian food that isnt overpriced.   The Dhaba seem to have it all covered, great food, good service and fairly priced. We managed to get a Groupon to save a little more too.   The naan bread was a highlight, very light and not doughy at all. We both had chicken dishes that were outstanding.   Great job all round, thanks Dhaba."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and I've been delighted each time.  I try different dishes each time I go, so it's hard for me to say that I have a favorite.  Vindaloo of any kind is my favorite at any Indian place, and this place certainly won't disappoint if you like this dish.  I had Kofta last night for the first time, and I absolutely loved it.  I've also tried their Lamb Tikka Masala, which is awesome.  I imagine that everything is good here."}
{"text":"In a word...yummy! The staff is helpful and gracious; the restaurant itself delightful. We have eaten here a few times and find the food to be consistently delicious. Our only observation is that the curry dishes seem to be more sauce than anything else  . That said, we really enjoy this restaurant and its delicious food"}
{"text":"Excellent food.. excellent presentation.. I can tell the food is a labor of love. The flavor of the food pops in your mouth... good for lunch or dinner.. suggestion... take their advice on a reservation.. they are a small but busy restaurant on the outskirts of Tempe."}
{"text":"I wrote a review for this last week, but just realized that I should have posted it here, rather than under \"Indian Plaza.\"  I have been here three times, and each time I wonder how I have lasted so long without this food. Just last week I had a lunch special (a very good deal) that came with a drink, mango lettuce salad, the best freshly baked naan bread I've ever had, mint yogurt sauce, rice, lentils, and my main entree of vegetarian dumplings in a creamy tomato sauce. Delicious! I was completely full, but I didn't feel gross like some American restaurants leave me feeling. I still had room for some hot chai tea made from scratch. It was perfect just as it was, without any sweetener.  The first time I went our server was nice but not so attentive; this last week the service was excellent. I never had an empty glass, and our food was quick to arrive. The ambience is intimate - a great place to go on a date or catch up with an old friend.  This is a true Tempe treasure!"}
{"text":"I have had the best Indian food so far in tempe. I love the saag and makki ki roti. But when i went the second and third time on a Monday, this week and last week, there is a receptionist who did not let us in. First time she said that there was a 45-1 hour waiting when I could see empty tables and second time today she did nit let us in at 8:15 when the official closing time is 8:30. It is such a regret that a nice restaurant has a very rude receptionist. I guess her name is Deepal, as her co workers were calling her by same name."}
{"text":"An amazing place! Can't even count the number of times I've gone. The food is always incredible. The staff is always very kind and willing to hlep you choose what is right for your meal. It has a beautiful atmosphere and the shop next door has any desi things you would need.  My favourite resturaunt in all of Arizona."}
{"text":"The food here is the best. No question. Their Chicken Tikka Masala is phenomenal and no place compares.  The atmosphere is nice as well."}
{"text":"we shared the samosas and chicken tikki massala. very good food, and good service. We received the rice pudding for our complimentary dessert/yelp check in. That was good as well. We would definitely recommend this if you are looking for Indian."}
{"text":"Always a winner with me!  Plan on spending more time where than you may at another restaurant, this is a good thing.  I know that someone is making my food not shleping it onto a plate from the microwave.  Get the Lamb Vindaloo...SPICEY"}
{"text":"The food is really tastey and dilicious, however, the ladey in the front disck is not smiling at all"}
{"text":"When you walk in,  you can smell how amazing the food will taste.  We ordered the masala chai drinks,  which were great and free refills! We ate the garlic naan, chicken tikka masala and lamb vindaloo,  which came with white basmati rice. So delicious.  We had the kheer rice pudding dessert and the gulab jabun.  Together they are AMAZING.  Basically one of the best Indian food places in the valley"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a couple of girlfriends.  Decent but not exceptional Indian food overall, depending on which item you order.  I ordered the Jhelum Gosht (lamb wrap) which I did find very tasty. The other items which I can't recall since they left no impression were so-so."}
{"text":"Ate here a few nights ago and enjoyed it.  I haven't been to any other Indian restaurants in the valley and didn't know what to expect, especially on Apache in East Tempe.  The interior was well done, the service was good, and the food was average.  I was hoping for a bit more spicy of a dish but I was satisfied.  Got the chicken curry with rice and garlic naan.  The naan was yummy!  As was the beer... think I ordered the Himalayan Blue? Or something along those lines.  Only oddity was that there were a couple of tables that looked open and unreserved when we arrived but still had to wait 15 minutes.  Was worth the wait, though, and I'll gladly go back when I get the craving."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian food! Really neat atmosphere with friendly staff. The naan is also really yummy! Definitely worth a try if you're looking for good Indian food."}
{"text":"The food was great. I was using a groupon and called ahead to make a reservation. We were seated promptly. The tables and settings were beautiful and really added to the experience. The menu was quite long so I just ordered a recommendation that I read from someones else's review. I ordered lamb curry. It was good. Everyones was very happy with there meal. The only reason I am not giving a fifth star is the price. It is pretty expensive and I do not think I will come back unless it is with my parents or i can get my hands on another groupon. The food tasted really authentic and the environment was great."}
{"text":"A disaster. We were told it would be an hour wait. No problem. It was a little over an hour, but still, no problem. It's 8:35 pm. No waiter until 9 pm. Nothing. Nada. Then, we tried to order a bottle of wine. Selection #1: \"Oh, we're out of.\" Selection # 2: \"Let me see...\" \"No, we're out of that one. My husband gamely tries another selection. They come back with \"We're out of that as well. Perhaps you might like the merlot?\"   The food arrives, blessedly, quickly. It's mediocre Indian. We've lived in major metropolitan areas and just weren't impressed. The menu, at first glance, IS impressive. But the food was just above average.  One last note. The alley-shaped space is a noise box. Be prepared to yell your thoughts across the table. So much for a nice night out.  **UPDATE** The owner offered us a dinner in response to our disappointment. We responded that, rather than that, that he ensure that no future diners experienced what we experienced. I'll give him another star for trying to remedy the situation :  )"}
{"text":"My first experience at The Dhaba was excellent. The food is rich and flavorful, and the vindaloo packs quite a punch. The staff is friendly and took great care of us. We'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Wow.  Incredible.  Found this restaurant via my frequent flyer dining program.  Sure glad I did.  Warm and friendly and owner recognizes me every time I visit.  Take visitors there too.  Usually go with my my friend.  TG we both love Indian food.  My mother, now in her eighties, always look forward to eating there when she visits from Ohio.  Taken a number of friends there, and have a couple of friends coming from England in April.  It will be off the plane, straight into Dhaba from there.  Can't think of a more wonderful place to re establish old, long friendships.  Hope they are there forever.  I've eaten Indian in England, Canada and the US.  This is the BEST by far!  Try it, you'll love it"}
{"text":"Terrible Customer Service! Two hours late delivering my food and they refused to cancel the order.  The person who answered the phone kept telling me the food would be there in 45 minutes after I waited for an hour even though I was asking to cancel the order. They refused to give me their name and they refused to give me my money back. Then! Worse! They refused to let me pick up my order instead!! I am furious! There are dozens and dozens of Indian restaurants in the Tempe/Phoenix area. The Dhaba will not be seeing me again, and I will tell everyone this story. Spend your money at one of the courteous Indian restaurants instead."}
{"text":"YUP! Trust be, it really was that bad, in fact, I created a yelp account just to give this restaurant a review. Look, I am not a bitter person, but in the past 6 months or so, i have seen this restaurant go from bad to worse and feel a little annoyed that every time i go and try to encourage this restaurant, their service gets worse and so does the food! They don't seem to care anymore, so... now it is time to warn others...  I just asked for Poori and curry, but what I got was a half fried poori (it was totally raw in places and it felt like I had ordered it with a side of oil ! Not light and fluffy like it should be.The curry had no flavour, it was only because of the condiments that I was able to eat it ....   The Aloo Tikka for the appetizers was pretty damn bad too, i mean it was like eating a patties made out of powdered potato or something, Again, no flavour in that, the naan had residue of some sort on them and the okra curry... pfft... im sick of typing.. u get the point right?   Shame really... it used to be pretty good about a year ago...and I was their number one supporter... NOT anymore!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, and a staple to show new people Indian food. However, the service is mediocre, and not worth it. A simple task such as splitting the bill was an inconvenience and difficult task unless you specifically request it ahead of time, forcing us to find a way to make the bill that was inconvenient and unecessary. Won't be going back due to this simple issue, as there are better restaurants service and wise.  I can only recommend if you want food and care for nothing else."}
{"text":"Best saag paneer in the valley. Basmati rice was also an A+. The decor and tableware is also a nice touch. Chai was average. naan was also delicious.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"I'm from England and am Indian, so as far as curry's go it's safe to say I've had my fair share! Their food is the best Indian I have had the pleasure of tasting in the local area and is very reasonable price wise too. Great service and Yummy!"}
{"text":"I didn't like Indian food until I came to Dhaba. I love their signature dish, Dhaba Curry Chicken. They allowed us to order the lunch special even though it's not the specific day for that lunch special. The lunch special was a little bit cheaper and came with naan as well as rice and desert. They servers basically served unlimited rice for the group. The chicken was boneless, the curry was tasty and to the level of spiciness that you specify. This is our regular go to place for lunch and I don't think that's going to change any time soon!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place only once which was like 2 years back. One thing that stick'd out for me was the colorful interior with the theme of Indian flag. We were a group of 11 and we had a good time in their just having fun and enjoying the food. They served in copper plates and copper tumblers. The food was excellent we pretty much ordered the whole vegetarian menu n like a chicken dish.. The taste reminded of food back home.  They even had a big screen TV playing Indian music videos, some of musics were the once we grew up with. Brought back memories. Me n my friends still talk about the food in dhaba n the experience we had in there. A memorable time to cherish and maybe go visit this place one day."}
{"text":"Their garlic naan is some of the best naan I've had in the valley. Their service was good and their decor was very beautiful. We used a Groupon and the meal was a great deal! We would definitely return."}
{"text":"We had a coupon for this restaurant from restaurant.com... excellent choice for New Year's Day lunch.  Interesting assortment of menu items, good service (mostly)... some observations 1.  There are some appetizer menu items that are purported to be \"Indian Street treats\".  We have come across these before... excellent!  We tried the papdi chaat, which proved superior to others we've had.  (If this is what people eat on the streets of India, perhaps it's time to visit...) 2.  They offer thali platters, which doesn't seem common in Phoenix.  Wonderful to have a variety of tastes to try.  \"Medium\" spice was not very hot. 3. Two different servers were taking care of our table.  They kept repeating each other's actions.  We asked for a box, one went to get a box... the other comes up and cheerfully asks, \"Would you like a box?\"  Same with dessert and the check. 4.  The unisex bathroom is designed such that if you are sitting (hovering) on the toilet, you are face-to-face with a urinal.  We will go back.  Especially if another restaurant.com coupon appears."}
{"text":"First time here, and I'm a fan!  I grew up eating some pretty amazing, home cooked Indian ..and have to say..this place came pretty close.   I appreciate the management's effort to be unique and sophisticated, while staying true to their roots. I know its especially tough these days, when everyone's looking for a shortcut. We went here for my husband's birthday, and really loved the flavors.. We also met the owner who reminded me of my grandfather back home (is that weird?..)  We definitely are looking forward to going back, which is extremely rare for us with an Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"This was our third trip to The Dhaba in three months and it was excellent, as always.  The service was attentive and the food was outstanding.  Their food is the best, and most authentic Punjab, in the Valley.  This visit we had five adults and the entire bill was just $75.00!  Crazy reasonable!  The paneer was excellent, the mango chicken yummy and the lamb was so mouth-watering!  Their garlic naan is great.  We skipped dessert tonight, but last visit had their rice pudding.  Yum!  After we left the restaurant we got a telephone call from them saying that \"the gentlemen sitting on the end of the table dropped $15.00 and we needed to come back for our money\".   He'd never have known the dfference if they hadn't called us, so we were extremely impressed with this kindness and honesty!!  All-in-all a great experience once again."}
{"text":"They close at 8:30 and if you go 1 minute late they say they can't seat you. Bad attitude"}
{"text":"We started eating here last year & we were very impressed with the service & the food.  Since then, I feel like the service is somewhat lack luster, refusing to allow coupons to be used on the take out orders and insisting they have a credit card number when you phone something in.  We used to be able to order special requests, but not now.  The flavors of the food are good, but the portion size in relation to the price is small.  The chicken is usually over done & not the best cuts of meat, but because the sauces are so vibrant, it's easy to hide from some.  Rice & Naan are separate, which is disappointing.  The atmosphere is nice & not tacky like many other indian restaurants."}
{"text":"a precious, authentic, little wonder.   went with my family from out of town and was worried my dad would be disappointed with the relatively conservative portion sizes. however- when you treat your taste buds with something so exquisite, you don't want to overwhelm them with massive platters of ambrosia. And -even though when they delivered the small bowls of tear-jerkingly-delectable curry we wondered if we would need to order more--we actually had enough to take home.   Plus, when filling up the takeout boxes, we found ourselves shamelessly scraping the bottom of each and every quaint little bowl.   Why only 4 stars? I haven't tried everything and look forward to updating this with another happy stomach and an additional star. Prices may be seen as somewhat steep for the quantity of food. But again I say, quality my friends, quality."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Naan was excellent along with Chicken Tikka masala."}
{"text":"The Dhaba was a real treat!  I went on a weekday evening about 8:30pm and was surprised how busy it was.  First good sign. The two of us were immediately seated and served chilled water in the most interesting copper goblets.  A selction of chutney and papadum came right away as well.  The Hostess was also our server, She took our beverage order while we began a strategy of what to order.  The menu was very extensive and contained many items I had never heard of before. Despite the wide array of choices we stayed pretty basic, choosing a paneer masala, chicken tikka, a savory chick pea dish and of course basmati rice and naan.   The meal came quickly and was the freshest I think I have ever had.  Every bite was phenomenal. From the Service to the dishes and everything in between made this experience truly memorable.  I cannot wait to go back!!  The only thing I would change- Now I am being hyper critical, would be the lighting.  It was very bright for an evening meal.  I guess it made me appreciate the appearance of the food easier."}
{"text":"The $11 a-curry-a-day lunch combos was paltry and plain bland. Dal was flavorless and the rice was tough. So I effectively paid $11 for a few mouthfuls of chicken curry (which was decent) and two pieces of naan. I'd rather go to a place like little india where they charge half as much without the fancy decor. The paneer entree dishes though are just fabulous. If two people are going I'd say forget about variety and just order paneer."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner. Service and food was fabulous. Staff was over the top friendly and helpful. I don't have much Indian cuisine experience but my friend does and we both loved the food. The restaurant decor was comfortable. The only negative was the lighting could have been a bit dimmer, too bright. Otherwise we will return."}
{"text":"I have given this restaurant three try's and come from an Indian family and we love fresh food! The first take out experience was very good. The second time my boyfriend and I dined in and they told us they couldn't change the level of hot spice to medium because the food was already premade! Which always makes me wonder when the last time it was actually cooked. The 3rd and last time we came in my food was cold and the service was awful. Try Tandoori Times or Curry Corner both are great and they are very accommodating. Curry Corner was even featured on the food network!"}
{"text":"I'm amazed I've had Indian food but not like this  amazing flavors I had the vegetarian dish and it makes me wanna go meatless but service was great nice ambience and we'll worth the price big up dhaba!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Indian restaurants in town. I keep coming back to this place. I highly recommend it. The food was amazing, and the service was also great. Last time we had chicken tikka masala with garlic naan bread and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and wonderful service! The food is the best Indian/Pakastani food I have ever had. This was my second time going and I plan to return again. Also be sire to check out their store next door. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love this place. Not only is the food beyond delicious, I think the portions are fine and the service is second to none. The woman who manages could not be nicer and the gentleman who works the shop next door (and who I suspect is the owner) is always making sure that we had a superb dinner.   We do enjoy trying different Indian restaurants in town, but we still count The Dhaba as the standard by which all others are to be measured.  I wish these folks the very best. Even good restaurants come and go in this economy and I want The Dhaba to be around for a long, long time."}
{"text":"It's just an over priced place with very little regard to service. We had to wait for half an hour after which we got the table and the food took another half hour to come. My husband ordered an extra roti which came after 25 mins of us just sitting and waiting staring at the entree!!! I ordered a Kashmiri chicken tikka masala which was extremely bland, my suggestion would be check out curry corner (just a block away) for half the price and way better taste. All and all if you wish to blow your money on fraud tasteless Indian food... Go ahead and try it."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed our evening at Dhaba, we went towards the end of their day and had nice relaxing dinner.  Tony who brought us our food is so much fun to talk to and his stories were fun to listen to. I liked listening to his philosophy of dining which was people should come, relax and eat and not run off in a mad rush haha!  We had vegetable Korma which was very tasty (lacked a little salt but better less than more) and we totally loved the aloo kulcha! I would go back just to have the aloo kulcha.  Tony was really nice and gave us a free desert for the heck of it and we had a really nice kheer! We will definitely be going back there again!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best Indian around town. It's tough not to want this every night. They have messed up my order 1 time out of like 100 and are always friendly. Tikka Masala is awesome and I like the Chicken saag with chunks of ginger in it. So good and always keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"I found a long black hair in my amritsari samosa chat. When I pointed it out not even one person aplologized. Never coming back here. Very unhygienic."}
{"text":"MY FAVOURITE. Love their chicken Tiki and meat samosas. Best indian AZ has to offer."}
{"text":"From the classy (if random) decor to the charming hostess (clara), this place is lovely. My first visit was for lunch. The very reasonably priced special included salad, naan, raita, dal, entree, rice and house dessert (lovely rice pudding and chai). While most restaurants have a five-point heat scale, Dhaba goes with ten. This means they have a better handle on the subtle intermingling of tastes and flavors. I ordered a \"five,\" which barely registered on my taste buds. Next time, I'm turning up the heat!"}
{"text":"We have visited this place on multiple occasions, and it never fails the manager is awful! I have been with and without reservations. With reservations the manager refuses to seat you until the exact time even if there are lots of empty tables. She will seat people who come without reservations but if you have a reservation you will have to wait till its your time. Even if your table is ready with the reserve sign, you will sit and watch your empty table till its your exact time. The food is decent this is one of the reasons we keep coming back.  I have recommended this place to a few people but with the growing number of Indian restaurants in the metro of Phoenix maybe customer service should be something this place should work on!"}
{"text":"nice place , had somosa, naan, veggie korma, saag and vindaloo.. food i would give. ( on a scale of 1-10 a 6.5...) food was good but off a bit on the flavor. one of the better places I've been to in AZ for indian tho...i would come again..."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had in AZ so far. The garlic Naan, chicken korma, and vegetable fritter platter were amazing. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was due to price. I'm not sure if it's more expensive due to cooking style & time (their food is noticeably better) or if it could be cheaper. I will eventually check out other places to compare but it may take awhile to move on :)."}
{"text":"They have a variety of items on the menu, the items are vegetarian and meat. I ordered the samosa chaat because it's a very tasty appetizer. It's a mixture of sweet and spicy flavors. I also ordered the Kashmiri chicken tikka masala because I like the chicken and the sauce the chicken is smothered in. Overall I had a good experience, and the atmosphere is traditional Indian. Only thing that was different was lunch specials were not able to be shared and that was the first time I ever heard that at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I have frequented this restaurant since it opened. I understand the problems people may have with the place, i have had a few of my own.   There are also the great things which people have mentioned. Here are some more....   There is this new guy in charge there, from Sri Lanka, who is really cool (and into Pink Floyd). I think he's changed a few things recently, and also is a very helpful energetic server. Each day, there is now a different salad for lunch. Our lunch thali began with an outstanding salad with mangoes, lettuce, and veggies served in a bowl shaped papad! Later that lunch, when he found out my friend did not eat dairy, he offered an awesome fruit salad for desert instead of the gulab jamen in creamy fruit sauce.   Another time, we were talking to our waiter about one of the dishes, a bitter melon dish (the melon with the spikey outside). We decided to stick to our normal orders. Then, the guy brings out the dish for our group of three to try on the house! I would not recommend ordering the dish here, it is funky and bitter. At the end of the meal, they brought out hot towels and lemon for us to clean up with. They were pampering us, maybe because we come in all the time and tip well.   I later had the bitter melon in New Delhi and it was way better. I'm thinking the melon might be shipped here, giving it a strange taste. This is most certainly the case with the Indian soda, Limca, which you can order. I believe they ship over old batches, as evidenced by the lower cost printed on the bottle, and the aftertaste of cardboard. I want a real limca so bad. Its nice that they have chaat (indian street food), but it was better before I knew what Indian street food really tastes like. Still, it's these things which makes Dhaba stand out above the other places, that and its cool to hang out there.   It also can be slightly cheaper than Delhi palace, or royal taj."}
{"text":"I actually really liked the food. The naan bread and saag with paneer (they called it something else here) were really awesome and probably the best I have ever had. However, the portions are the smallest I've ever seen in an Indian restaurant.    Why I'm giving this place one star:  My spicy chicken in red curry (which was not spicy at all) had a really odd texture.  At first, I thought it was just a weird spice that tasted like sand since I'm not very familiar with Indian food (whatever was in the rice really threw me off).   It hit me when I realized my gums and roof of my mouth were chopped up and bleeding on the ride home: it was glass.   I feel like an idiot not realizing it while I was there since I have never dealt with this situation, but it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had in a restaurant, and I had to leave town very shortly to beat the snow in Flagstaff so I wasn't thinking straight.   Overall, the food is very good but in small portions, the employees are really nice, but that glass ruined this place forever for me.   EDIT: Maybe it wasn't glass, but something really crunchy and terrible tasting that could scratch my mouth.  Maybe it was rusted metal from a spoon? Me and my girlfriend are trying to guess what it was, haha."}
{"text":"I am not sure how they have so many good reviews or may be I chose a wrong day. First thing the lady at the counter needs to learn some courtesy and manners. She looks much uninterested and unfriendly to get you a table.  Now getting to the food: Hariyali Paneer tikka: this dish even by their own description was way different. Check the pic... And it was just sautéed In tomato ketchup with a very sweet taste. Sorry but worst I ever had.  Still we had hope with the dhaba chicken curry the recommended dish which again was below avg. and had sweet tomato purée taste.  The only saving grace was the dal tarka and the roti which was the best and that's were they got the star."}
{"text":"I read good reviews and had taken my good friend to this restaurant. I have ordered Goat Biryani and to my surprise I found a dead roach in my food. I have complained to the management and the they have waived the bill but it was an embarrassing moment in front of my friend. I am not going here again."}
{"text":"Officially my favorite restaurant...EVER! They have a total respect for people and food. Can't wait to try more vegan dishes."}
{"text":"Had been to this place on a Sunday evening for take out dinner after reading the numerous reviews in yelp What we concluded at the end that it was not worth the price that we paid for. For God's sake, its way too pricey. One appetizer, one entrée ,one naan and one kulcha and the price was $40. We ordered chicken seekh kebab as appetizer and we got 6 finger length pieces for $13. We had a chicken curry as entrée which cost us $15 but had only 2 proper sized chicken pieces and the rest were broken chunks in the gravy. The paneer kulcha was bland. They even took a 18% gratuity and that too for a takeout. I have had some good Indian food in other restaurants but none were as pricey as this was and will surely not recommend to others nor come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Have been to the Dhaba for many times since moved to Tempe. I always have wonderful experience in the Dhaba. I love their food and great service, which remind me of my trips to India. Had a great interview with the humble, friendly, and helpful owner today as I am working on a project of Indian cuisine. Very amazed by his experience and bigger vision of this not just restaurant, but also cultural heritage."}
{"text":"Crappy overrated place with high prices - best place for americans...worst for indians. Chinese waitress was rude and thought she knew more about indian food."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, but I would strongly suggest you make a reservation. On our first attempt we were turned away at 830pm without a reservation.  We were in the area and it was early so we stopped in on Sat. evening as we passed by at ~630pm. Several open tables but all were marked reserved. They reluctantly took us and 2 other tables that arrived shortly after us. We waited about 10-15min.  to be served. It was only annoying because those other 2 tables had their orders taken before we had drink order taken. Once we ordered food was out promptly, under 15 min.  We loved the complimentary cracker/bread with sauces to start. Dhaba Chicken Korma & Tandori Tikke chicken were fantastic and worth the wait. Portions aren't huge but we still had leftovers.   We'll be making a reservation and returning soon!"}
{"text":"Didn't like the food at all.Apart from that unfriendly staff, we asked for something and have to remind them again and again.They don't bother if you need something.Food is on expensive side and you didn't get a quality indian food.This was our first and last time to go there. There are lot of good indian restaurant don't waste your time and money  ."}
{"text":"Punjabi cuisine. I won't consider myself very knowledgeable with Indian food. I won't be able to tell the difference from cuisines from different parts of India, but I can tell the difference between really good and flavorful Indian food.  THE PLACE: Located in a small plaza with small shops, including an Indian market. It smells marvelous in the market. They sell all kinds of spices, a lot of english products (no surprise), even some frozen, heat and eat indian dishes. Don't forget to pick up some home mades sweets too. Place provides ample parking for all the businesses in the plaza. The restaurant itself, is not that big, but it is comfortable. Always clean.  THE SERVICE: Friendly and helpful. Not certain what to get? What goes together well? Don't hesitate to ask. Granted I make it a point to avoid busy hours, my experience has always been excellent. Always attentive. I'm not a soda drinker so I really appreciate an establishment that makes sure I have all the aqua I need in my cup.  THE FOOD: Vegan, vegetarian, omnivore or carnivore, you are welcome here. Everything is so flavorful. Don't ever skip on the Naan or Roti's, they are so good. Of course, it is best when consumed with the fabulous dishes such as Paneer Tikka Masala (I can bathe in the sauce --- so good!). Shehenshahi Palak Kofta is another good one. My kids and hubby enjoy the lamb dishes too. Oh, and the saffron basmati rice, smells so good and just compliments every dish. Hungry yet? I am.  A definite winner and favorite."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Indian food restaurant in the valley.  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that it doesn't beat my Indian friends' cooking.  :)  I love trying different dishes and I'm not afraid to do so because anything you order is flavorful and yummy.  My friends took me out for my birthday, and we all raved about the food.    My favorites are any of the paneer dishes, chicken tikka masala, and the Indian chai."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, tried this for take away. requested vegetable briyani (not in menu), it tasted like vegetable rice exactly how my mom makes but not briyani. Would have been happier if they told no briyani instead of giving vegetable rice. Paneer kofta in palak . That was too good.  Have to try that recipe. Onion kulcha was bit burnt.jeera rice was good. Price bit costly i think ."}
{"text":"The food here is very good. Make sure you make a reservation, because they will make you wait 30 minutes even if the restaurant is nearly empty with no reservation...just an FYI. But other than that, the service was great, and the food was amazing. Do pay attention to the spice level ratings...I love love hot and spicy food, and have won contests for eating spicy food that I have to sign wavers that I won't sue if it kills the contestants LOL...so I always order the highest spice levels. When they say, a 10 here, they MEAN a 10. It was sooo hot, but that is easily solved by just ordering a lower level. My wife ordered a 5 level, because she likes medium. A six or seven would have been good for me, and she should have ordered a 2. So, mild is a 1, medium is a 2 or 3, hot is a 5, and above 5 is firebrand! LOL I still recommend this place, it's great. :)"}
{"text":"The food was okay.  The service was poor.  The stainless steel cup with water was horrible.  The cup has steel rusts in the bottom.  The Asian server/manager knew about it and did not apologize.  She just smiled and was proud to say, \"This is stainless steel.\"  I was disappointed and not happy.  If I will have Tetanus, Dhaba is going to be sued!  I am not going back again.  Health Disclaimer: Please check your stainless steel cup.  Does it have stains?  Do you have a Tetanus shot?  Your life and health are at risk!"}
{"text":"when ever i visit tempe i come to Dhaba but God knows whats going on with their food recently . i had mixed Khazana last month in the midst of december it was so good and was perfectly spiced but now i had it last week and it was horrible the presentation itself made me realize that something is wrong. There were no flavours the texture was weird and on top it was overly cooked the chicken tikka and tandori was like rubber the seek kebab was bland with no spices or any taste and on top the shrimps looked liked they were only coloured and tossed with salt .the curries were ok but not so appetizing their Bhindi was excellent and the naan was also lousily cooked I know the owner makes a lot of effort to improve it and i dont want to criticize but i was not happy this time but i know they can do better ."}
{"text":"Awful service, food below par (heat the food please or maybe make it to order like a real restaurant), miserly quantity  and for desert come on, you get it directly from the grocery store refrigerator, i can get the whole box for a fraction of the price and take it home....  that being said, One thing though, its furnished uniquely and they serve in steel/copper vessels which is good.  Place is damn stuffy .no air flow, there is hardly any place to move in there and there are two women (that is questionable too) dancing in the middle of all this handling swords and fire . what the heck? who does that in india ? watch your check too. i had 12 bucks added in doubling some of my orders.. not worth your time or money.. go to tandoori times instead..."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Garlic Naan. It was a excellent choice. The staff and quality of the food is well worth experiencing for yourself. The Dhaba made me feel like I was in India. The culture and friendliness was wonderful."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Vegetarian offerings are fantastic and plentiful.  The restaurant is honestly a tad small but this has never been too much of a problem in the few times that I've visited."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre.  Nothing that great. We ordered Thalis. The biryani they served was nothing close what is biryani, it tastes like tomato paste. Chole was bland too. The tea that they served with thali was more water than tea.  In a nutshell don't even think about ordering a thali here."}
{"text":"I have eaten at way better Indian restaurants out here. The Malai Koftas were rock hard, and the Biryani was nothing more than Pulav. Someone please tell them the difference. Just not worth it!"}
{"text":"The day after my previous post, I received such a generous and kind letter from Raveen that I felt guilty about my rice comments! Customer service doesn't get better than this.  We will definitely be back soon :)"}
{"text":"Upon arriving at The Dhaba for a Sunday evening meal, we were greeted very quickly and kindly and told that there would be a 20 minute wait for a table. Having read the reviews of previous patrons, I was slightly frustrated because I knew it would be a wait once we were seated to get our food also. However, after a few minutes, I decided I would be prepared to wait and enjoy a nice, slow evening and meal, and remember to make reservations for future visits.       Once seated, it did take some time to get the order in, but it was well worth the wait. The Masala Chai tea was spiced to perfection, fragrant, and with some added honey, it was the perfect beverage. I had the vegetarian \"meat\"balls (I can't recall the Indian name) which were satisfying and savory and did not disappoint. Everything came out piping hot and fresh. I will most definitely be a returning patron."}
{"text":"A dab of fab here at the Dhaba... I couldn't resist!  If the only Naan you've had is from Trader Joe's , trust me on the advice to try the homemade version here!!!!  My guy and I have tried this spot twice and I know he loves it so we will be back.  The menu is ridiculously huge and nothing is a dumb downed name though they do have a description of everything.  I try the vegetarian combo (not remembering the name) that included a yummy salad, chai tea, vegetable curry, lentils, jasmine rice, and an order of naan for $15.  Seriously this place is legit!!  Why?  Food temps- hot when it's supposed to be!  Flavors- beautifully seasoned and delicious savory Indian flavors  Serving size- I pigged out and still had a full meal the next day  Authenticity- badass decor, tableware with live music sets the tone  We learned they do the last dinner seating at 8 so if you are going to get there a bit after you should call and make a reservation for 8:15.  We barely got in at 8:05 but saw another group turned away.  Yelp lists the hours until 9:30 maybe that is for the adjoining market."}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience with my friend here a couple weeks ago...   Caution: THE MENU IS HUGE... I don't even know what I ordered... I kept asking the waitress and then was like SURE... I do know we had the appetizer sampler... Again NO IDEA what it was, but ooooh so yummy My friend got chicken tikka masala with no heat, but it was still really good. I got a seven and by then end of the night I felt the burn...  The mango lassi were soothing and delicious  Plus we got a discount from google, so we were happy.   But WE FORGOT OUR LEFTOVERS  I was so sad. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"The best Indian Food in the Phoenix Valley! I have been going to the Dhaba for years and they are unforgettable! Don't forget about the daily lunch specials."}
{"text":"Good quality North Indian (Punjabi) food. Everything we ordered didn't come out perfect, but whatever did, deliciously compensated for what was missed.   The dreary details: It was our 2nd time here, hence the review. Pretty consistent with our first visit a year ago. Went for lunch both the times as a party of 4. All dishes were ordered at a spice level of 7/10.   First came the sweet lassi (yoghurt with sugar) and my friends got the cumin/pepper water drink. We liked both.  Our appetizer was the tandoori platter, a combination of the 3 meats below,  Sheek Kabab - Excellent. Will repeat it. The meat's flavor enhanced perfectly with mild herbs & spices. Chicken Kabab - A tad dry but with the red Chilli sauce, it was good. Shrimp - Will pass next time. Not well marinated in the spices. Was bland I thought.  Followed by,   Bhatura - Excellent. Deep fried but not soaking in oil. Soft and yum (psst.. Have a huge weakness for fried food) Chole - Okay.  The mixed vegetable pickle that came with it was so homely.. and the 3 together - \m/ :)  Chicken Tikka Masala - Thanks to fellow yelpers, we tried it and have no regrets. Rogan Gosht - Made of Lamb (should have been Mutton). Okay. Overpowering tomato taste, may not try again. Both curries came with plain basmati rice. Garlic Naan (yeah.. Not done with our order yet. We had soooo much food) - Excellent. Wouldn't always get such soft, garlicky naans even back home in India.  Aloo (Potato) Kulcha - Good.  Finally, the Chicken Biriyani. Bad. Was more like Pulav. The rice was sticky, not very flavorful. Won't try that again. But the rest of the gang (very Indian husband and 2 American friends) liked it. I like the biriyani at Kabab Palace better.  That's about it. We went at noon on a Saturday and were served without much wait time. They actually do allow reservations as early as 11:30 am. Staff are friendly. Though overpriced, we shall return to try other delicacies from their long list of menu items. For instance.. Missed the kurkure bhindi both the times. :/"}
{"text":"Made reservations here for Valentine's day on a whim. It was outstanding! The service was excellent. The entire staff is super friendly and the food is beyond Awesome! We recommend this place to everyone especially if you've never tried Indian food before. We'll definetely come back next time we're in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Just ate here a few weeks ago following a recommendation from a friend. Was not disappointed!!  The owners of this place are very kind and you can tell they take pride in what they do. The atmosphere is upscale, although it is a little quieter than I'd prefer. Everything in the restaurant is high quality, from the tables and chairs, to the plates and utensils, to the decor around the building.   The food was excellent. I ordered my favorite dish - tikki masala with tofu, and it was delicious. The flavors were hearty and deep. The rice was cooked perfectly. Very nice meal.   It is a little pricey but the food and service make up for it. Also it would be nice to have a little bit more parking available; if there are no spots available up front there is a lot around back. It looks a little sketchy but it seems to be a safe place to park your car.   I would definitely recommend this place as I had a great meal there and I will come back again soon!"}
{"text":"I had a groupon that I wanted to use. So I ended up going ot the Dhaba last week.   The place itself is a little small. The lady who served us was very kind. But what shocked me was the price of food. Considering that most dishes cost $14 , I would say this place is below the mark for the asking price they have . A normal vegan meal for 2 with 1 drink, 1 starter, 2 dishes came to a whopping $46, which is ridiculous considering the ambience of the place. Being an Indian myself, I can vouch that the food does not taste very authentic. Its a more watered down version of Indian food.  All in all, not worth it."}
{"text":"Just came back from this restaurant. We ordered chicken korma and Rogan josh. The meat on the korma was not done and it did not taste like chicken. I have a stomach upset within half hour of eating there. I could barely drive home with the stomach ache. I dont think we are going back there ever. By the way we are from the Indian subcontinent so we are well-accustomed with Indian cuisine. Horrible experience!"}
{"text":"My brother and I decided to get some take out and thought this would be a great place to try. We shared curry chicken, the Lakhnavi Shahi Paneer,  an order of rice and order of garlic naan.  Everything was very fresh and tasty. However, the Lakhnavi Shahi Paneer really stood out. It was probably the best Indian dish I've ever tasted. I'm already itching to go back and try more dishes on the menu!  Also -love that they stay open til 10!"}
{"text":"Good food, wide ranging menu, excellent ambiance and service. I would recommend the the Malai Kofta and Paneer Tikka Masala. The Kadai Paneer was not so tasty.   The prices are high but they often run promotions on Groupon etc.   While you're there, you may also want to check out the Indian store right next door, especially for Indian sweets or samosa."}
{"text":"The Dhaba is by far my favorite Indian food restaurant! I always get the vegetarian or seafood dishes and they never disappoint. The korma and saag dishes are my favorites. I've taken many people to this restaurant and everyone has been very happy with it. The staff is friendly and the service is always good. I think they have some of the best naan around."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Dhaba many times.  I have always enjoyed the food and I've tried many items from their menu.  The restaurant itself has a nice ambience, quiet, and the service has always been good.  Of the Indian restaurants I have been to in Phoenix, this is by far my favorite.  I recommend trying something from the chaat menu - these items are complex and flavorful in a way that will delight you if you love that aspect of Indian food.  On weekend nights I would recommend making a reservation as the seating capacity is on the small side."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout, my naan was Raw. My chicken curry was bland, too much tomato sauce and not much cream. I ordered the dessert gulabjaman, tasted like the kind that comes out of a can and was microwaved! I don't recommend this place for GOOD Indian food."}
{"text":"Before today I had only one experience with Indian food.  It came in the form of an eating challenge in New York City.  It was fun but not very tasty and left me with a flaming mouth and weak bowels.  A friend wanted to try and Indian place in her neck of the woods.  I checked Yelp and saw that the reviews for this place were bad so I mentioned The Dhaba.  The reviews were good, I always wanted to try it and it's right across the street from my place.    Very happy we dropped by.  The restaurant was on the small side but had enough tables to accommodate anyone that dropped by.  The decor was nice and I especially liked the metal water glasses.  Very cool.  I ordered garlic naan and a lamb curry dish.  The naan was fantastic and the lamb was great.  The naan provided a great way to scoop up the excess curry.  For my beverage I selected a tasty Indian beer.  My friend ordered a veggie sandwich stuffed with potatoes that she really enjoyed.  She also ordered little bits of chicken tenders.  These were fantastic.  The breading was good and the chicken had a little kick.  If you check in you will get a free desert.  However I was not offered a choice.  It was mandatory rice pudding.  It's not what I wanted but since it was free I made no complaint.  I could take or leave the rice pudding.  Service was prompt and attentive.    Be prepared to spend some money.  The Dhaba isn't cheap.  Our bill came in just under $50.  It's not the type of place I can afford to eat at on a regular basis but it's fantastic for a special occasion.  If you're a fan of Indian food or looking for something new, I don't think The Dhaba will disappoint."}
{"text":"The reason I have time to write this review is because I ordered one simple food and I am already waiting for half hour!  When you ask they are smiling but you can feel the arrogance! Let me continue waiting and see what the food taste! 400 review place! Should do much better.   Finally the food come after 40 minutes! Ok taste not to much better than other Indian restaurants nearby. The bread is even burned on one side!  There is a small hair in the soup. But it is too hard to take a Not worth the price they charge for this kind of service and quality of the food!"}
{"text":"Yum ! Was craving good indian food and got take out, very satisfied.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because it was very pricey for the portion size, that could be just because I did carry out though,  in which case I would recommend dining in. expansive menu and food was delicious. Can't wait to visit again !"}
{"text":"The place was pretty empty for a Friday lunch but everything was very good so no complaints!  I loved the spicy Vindaloo and the Pangang evened everything out. The lemonade was spicy and refreshing.  Just wonderful."}
{"text":"Questionable Tipping Policy!  While dining here, I was told by an employee that the servers do not keep the tips you leave on your credit card or as extra cash on top of the bill.  If you want to tip your server, discretly hand them cash when managament / owners are not present.  As a server I think this situation is disgusting and contacted the US Department of Labor, Arizona office.  They do think this is an issue that would need to be addressed, but cannot do anything unless an effected employee contacts them.  Their phone number is 602-514-7100.  As for their food, it was very good, probably the best Indian food I have found in the region.  The service has been slow and rather poor every time I have eaten there."}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen, I have found my new favorite Indian food restaurant. Groupon had a deal and we snatched it up as we've been in search of trying new places.   We arrived about an hour before they were closed and it was almost empty. They still asked if we made a reservation (we did) -- so it seems like that may be a requirement for later dining during the week. Their table settings are unusual and fit perfectly with the ambiance. The tin water glasses keep your water cold throughout your meal.  I searched the large menu for starters that weren't deep fried and were vegetarian-friendly, but we settled on the paneer fritters. They came with curried garbanzo beans that had the perfect amount of spice. This cheese is amazing, you guys.  For my entree, I decided to go with the vegetarian thali plate. It came with a large salad (the veggies on this were great, but the iceberg lettuce was not the best choice and it had a bit too much dressing), a curried vegetable (PERFECTION), a lentil and bean side (divine), yogurt side (perfect for cooling down the spice), large portion of colorful rice, 3 pieces of naan, a dessert (the BEST rice pudding with mango swirl) and a chai. The menu clearly states that you cannot share the thali, which I thought was hilarious because it's SO HUGE. No, seriously, I had leftovers for 2 more meals after this.  My boyfriend ordered a taro dish which they mentioned to us was 'dry' - no sauce. It tasted a lot like a potato and it wasn't my favorite -- I LOVE the sauces and spices the most - but he enjoyed it.   Our bill was $47 for an appetizer, a large vegetarian thali dinner plate ($14), the taro dish and 2 of their Indian beers ($5 each). I'm a fan! Only one star off because unless you order the large vegetarian plate, all the other options are a bit pricey. I can't imagine that this place does a lunch buffet but I may be wrong."}
{"text":"What an absolute gem of a place! Put our name in for a table and while waiting, went next door to check out the little shop. What a pleasant surprise to find that it had groceries, religious and decorative items, and even clothing, jewelry and books! The owner of the shop had the most amazing, gentle energy and spent time talking to my husband and I about the history of the shop. I love how he's mostly concerned with bringing an authentic Indian experience to Tempe with high-quality products. The shop had such great energy too, you could tell a lot of love went into it!  The restaurant next door had amazingly fresh, hot food like the kind that an auntie would make at home. The shop owner came by after our dinner to see how we liked it. This specific treatment left a lasting impression that will keep me going back for years to come, even if it's a bit of a drive! Great, great place for true authenticity and beyond friendly service. I can't wait to go back!! This is now my one-stop shop for all things Indian."}
{"text":"The prices are a little high compared to others, but there is no other place I would rather order Indian food from. They have all the right details to make you feel like you are actually dining in India."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere! Great food!! Ordered the paneer tikki masala, lamb curry and butter chicken!! Was so good. And the server was so nice!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!  Cute decor, nice staff & GREAT food!  Will be back for sure.  First time using Dining Local and it was a win."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch today, but ordered a dinner entree and I couldn't be happier.  I've been to a lot of the valley's indian joints, and I can unequivocally state that this is the best indian food I have ever eaten.  The dishes are inspired and, most importantly, delicious.  I had a spicy green chile naan and lamb cooked with spinach and flavored with freshly ground ginger, garlic and spices.  My buddy had a spicy chicken dish marinated with exotic spices and combined with vinegary potatoes.  There was an ice cream desert that we didn't have room for but sounded awesome: Dhaba ice cream made with a unique blend of milk, almonds, pistachio, cardamom and saffron.  The atmosphere is great too, nice seating area, copper plates & cups.  Large wooden tables.  I felt like royalty.  Also, the plethora of beautiful Indian women is a powerful digestif."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is the best Indian food I've ever had. My husband had tried Indian food before several times and was not a fan but after purchasing a Groupon he agreed to try The Dhaba and absolutely loved it. It is a smaller restaurant with very cute décor and a relaxing atmosphere. I recommend putting in a reservation, especially if you go on the weekend. Some of our favorites are the Rehriwale dahi bhalle, Kashmiri Chicken Tikka Masala, and Lamb Curry. The fresh naan and rice are amazing. The service is a little slow sometimes but the food is always stellar."}
{"text":"I have been in a lot of Indian restaurant , this one was first experience in AZ , I saw good reviews and I was so excited to try it , Its totally horrible experience, i order three different kind I ask for medium spicy , food was super spicy and when I ask her she was very rood and she said no it's not spicy , I didn't like the way she talk , I ask her for the check she make me pay everything , I didn't even touch my food , very bad experience, never go back to them"}
{"text":"It's average Indian, not bad.  Flavor was OK for the tikka masala and the goat curry.  Naan was very disappointing -- more like pita bread than naan. I would give the food 3-stars.  However, for what you get, it's pricey, so I knocked off one star.  I would not be going back there because I can't justify the price for what I get in return."}
{"text":"This place has terrible food, people that is not Punjabi food! It is bland and does not have flavors. Even the Rotis were mediocre. Do not be mislead by the awards, this place is not authentic at all. The worst was the tandoori chicken, could they had added more color! Never going back and you should neither. Service is not great either, they did not change the plates after the starters and looked shocked when we asked them to. We needed to ask for water so many times! Not worth the four stars!"}
{"text":"Bought the deal chicken for our trip to AZ from So Cal. The food had plenty of flavor and was delicious. Ordered a chicken, lamb, fish and rice dish and wasn't disappointed. The spice level 3 of 10 had plenty of kick. The service was very good. I would definitely come back to the Dhaba when visiting AZ again."}
{"text":"We went to celebrate a classmate's birthday and had a really good time.  I adored the tableware: it was heavy and had a \"medieval\" feel.   The lunch special is a really good deal.  I'm not a fan of paneer and that was the day's veggie lunch special, so  I got the veggie wrap instead.  It was excellent!  So were the fries (more fries please!).  The waitresses weren't that personable and although the lunch special includes dessert, they asked my friends if they still wanted it.  Huh? I didn't have a lunch special, so I used my handy dandy Yelp check in offer for a free dessert, so I could get some rice pudding.  I've been eating rice pudding all my life and have had many different versions.  Liquidy rice pudding? No thanks.  Thank God we had a terrific birthday cake."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the only place I go for Indian Food. Oh my goodness!!!! The staff is so nice and the food gives me random cravings almost everyday haha! I recommend the Chicken Tikka Masala at a number 4 or 5 hotness level! Mmmmm. It's a little place that makes a date night very intimate or a lunch with a friend very personable. I had two friends that had never tried indian food before so I took them here and they were in shock haha. Definiately a great place to go. IF YOU ARE GOING FRIDAY OR SATURDAY NIGHT make a reservation. There are a lot of other people who have the same opinion as me :) Oh and most plates are around $15 so a little up there but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Central Phoenix and loved Flavors of India.  Since moving to Mesa, I just hadn't seen or found a good replacement until I tried The Dhaba.    The service was a little slow at times, but the overall atmosphere was friendly and inviting.  The food came out hot and was flavorful, with a hint of spice, and delicious.  Both the plain and garlic naan were crispy on the outside but still soft on the inside, the perfect combination.  There is also a small, but decent, selection of Indian beer.  And though the food came out in what appeared to be somewhat small dishes, we had enough leftovers to take home and make another meal."}
{"text":"Good service, attentive servers. We had the chicken curry, the lamb rogan ghosht and saraon ka saag with naan and rice. Finished off with the kheer compliments of yelp check in and a masala chai. They tailor the spicyness to your palate and did a good job with that. The lamb was very salty but however they graciously fixed it for me. I will come back and try some of the chaat next time."}
{"text":"Butter chicken was okay. Chicken Korma was okay as well. Wanted it spicy and it wasnt. The rice is rather dry. The rice pudding was delicious. The service was great. It just really didn't do it for me. I had a bit of a higher expectation but maybe I am being biased because I grew up with Indian friends. The garlic nan is amazing though. And the restaurant itself is a cute little place. Overall a 3/5. I would eat here again If I was in a rush and needed to order take out."}
{"text":"After trying curry corner I went on an indian binge. The Dhaba is just as delicious but the service lacked...a smile from the waiter would have made this review 5 stars."}
{"text":"i love this place a lot. but there are a few things you need to know:  1. make a reservation, even if it's tuesday at 5:30 and you're already en route. i've had to wait for a table in the room full of empty tables simply because i didn't call ahead. 2. never pay full price. they always have a groupon, living social, restaurant.com or other coupon available somewhere and paying full price is a little steep. 3. get the garlic naan. each veggie dish i've had i've loved, you can't go wrong. the paneer dishes are rich and delicious and make me fat and happy."}
{"text":"I had the Goat Curry (Asli Tari Baker Di) that I got a hotness of 7 (between 1 to 10). I would have enjoyed it more if I had gotten a hotness of 5, but it was great.  I think $23.80 for that and a side of Nan bread, after tax, is a bit much. I walked out spending  $30 with the tip and I think that's too expensive. So I won't go there very often, but the flavors were spot on delicious!"}
{"text":"Loved the food and the people at Dhaba!  Fabulous and flavorful, true, rich and delicious Indian food, and I know Indian food, it is my favorite.  This is one of the best."}
{"text":"The Dhaba is well known in the area for their Indian cuisine, as evidenced by their wall of awards. I was happy to find a Groupon to try it out and they were nice enough to let us use it on a carry-out order, once I explained our situation over the phone. For that accommodation, I added a star :) The location is in a rather \"scruffy\" side of town (not sure I'd want to hang out there after dark). When I arrived to pick up our food at 6pm, there was only one table occupied in the restaurant.   We ordered two chicken tikka masala dinners--one mild and one medium in spice level. However, both looked and tasted exactly the same...very bland. Each meal consisted of about 4-5 small pieces of chicken with a cup of basmati rice. We also split an order of garlic naan, which was good. Now, we've eaten at a few other Indian restaurants before, and never once have we been able to finish our meal in one sitting; we always have leftovers. But we were left still feeling hungry.   $35 for 2 dinners and an order of naan. Small portions, overpriced and not impressed."}
{"text":"The Dhaba has been my go-to Indian food restaurant for years now. Indian has always rated as my #1 favorite food and I have tried MANY different Indian food restaurants throughout the greater Phoenix area (extending all the way up to north Glendale even) in my search for \"the best Indian food\". The Dhaba easily stands a head above the rest.  Consistently delicious food coupled with consistently good service and a HUGE menu make The Dhaba an easy decision for any night out. My personal favorite, albeit a predictable choice, is the Chicken Tikka Masala. Paired with an order of naan, it is always a dependable option and serving portions are more than adequate. (I always have leftovers.)  Prices are not \"cheap\", but I have never spent my money so quickly and cheerfully as for an order at The Dhaba and you really do get what you pay for in both quality and quantity. Being able to order takeout is also a wonderfully valuable convenience.  The interior is intimate and traditionally decorated. The staff is friendly and polite. Attached to the dining area is an Indian food market with all sorts of delicious foods including fresh veggies, spices, and rice at SUPER affordable prices and even a small boutique including trinkets, natural medicines, books, and even clothing!  The Dhaba is unique because it truly provides a total experience. It's a little community unto itself. Be sure to give yourself time to take it all in when you visit. Relax and enjoy some food, then visit the grocery and boutique. When you get home, write them a solid Yelp review and then show the place off to all your friends like I have!  :)"}
{"text":"This was our first time to The Dhaba . We decided to go based on the reviews in Yelp . It was very disappointing .  - We had set up a reservation at 8:00 PM and when we reach there the lady probably the owner says that we have just 30 mins to make all the orders and they take the last order only till 8:30 . We had to rush through the appetizers , main course , drinks and desserts .  -Service was very poor . The lady was cocky and wasn't pleasant at all . The waiter who came to serve had no idea where to keep the food and was literally giving the plate of naan to us and was not even bothered to take the finished plates off the table   -  Coming to the food . Now I've seen a lot of 5 star reviews for this restaurant . I feel it is the worst food for the price you are paying . Every dish was mediocre and costs atleast 15$    We ordered Paneer , Butter chicken and some lamb curry . ALL THE CURRIES TASTED ABSOLUTELY THE SAME . There was no salt and the base gravy was the same for all three . And they add too much color in their food    - I ordered Butter naan , and what I got was just some hard \"naan\" which had absolutely no  butter in it . The naan was really hard and in 5 minutes it became rock solid . The gobi parathas were under-cooked    If I could give this place Zero stars I would have done that . Not even one dish was worth eating . It is just a n overpriced place that serves poor quality food . Now a lot of people here might like it but being an Indian and knowing what actual Indian food tastes like , I feel the restaurant is a big disaster only good enough to burn a hole in your pocket . There is just too much hype about this place in all these websites .   The food is not even average and I would advice everyone to PLEASE NOT GO TO THIS PLACE . You have other Indian restaurants in Tempe , they are far better and cheaper . THIS IS AN OVERATED PLACE . FOOD IS POOR QUALITY , PRICEY and NOT AUTHENTIC  . It is just not worth it"}
{"text":"This place just opened up about a week ago, and I think it's a great addition to the Indian restaurants in the Valley.  My husband and I went to eat dinner here last night and, even late on a Monday, it was crowded. Beware - it's a small space, so if you are going on a weekend, I would call for reservations.  The restaurant, located next to the India Plaza on Apache Blvd., is really inviting - it's decorated with bright colors, nice, thick tables and contemporary lights and wall hangings. It has quite a different feel than most Indian restaurants in the Valley. It has fun, upbeat music playing too, although I think it could have been turned down a  *little* to make it easier to talk. I loved the menu, because it is quite varied, offering the 'usual' suspects as well as some different items like Goan fish curry, bitter melon curry, goat curries, and gobi manchurian. AND, it also serves chaat.  My husband and I, however, decided to stick with the more typical offerings for the night. He got the \"La Jawab Kadahi Gosht\" which was lamb pieces and veggies in a spicy yogurt sauce. It was seasoned really well and delicious. I ordered the malai kofta, which was also delicious and seasoned just perfectly. The rice and naan we ordered were tasty, and I loved the side of raita - instead of just a simple yogurt and cucumber dish that the restaurants around here typically serve, this raita had some veggies mixed in and, I think, little puffed wheat pieces. Yum! All the food comes in copper bowls and plates, too, which I love. The service was quite friendly, albeit a little slow (it took a while to get our food) - however, we felt that was more to do with ironing out some first-week kinks, rather than an indicator of anything more serious.  If you like Indian food, I would definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Yay 500th review. The best place to get Indian food in the valley we come here often and it is a always delicious. The vindaloo is very yummy. Everything is prepared well and the atmosphere is inviting. The staff is very pleasant and the specials are great."}
{"text":"Best Lamb Chops ever.  Briyani was awful (curry mixed with rice and was very spicy) but why care about Briyani when other dishes are very nice."}
{"text":"I got my garlic naan, and HOLY COW it's the best garlic naan I've ever had! But I LOVE garlic, and they put a lot on it. But the bread was so soft and delicious. The food was delicious, and we had a \"Buy With Me\"  coupon so the price wasn't bad. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"My review is for the food only-- I was traveling for a work trip and ordered Postmates from The Dhaba. Hands down some of the best Indian food I've had. I ordered the paneer tikka masala, medium spice, which came with basmati and naan. Also got a side of raita. Everything was so flavorful, and the spice levels were just right. The food here is more expensive than other Indian places I've been to ($23 for that order before tax & delivery fees), but the portions were generous and the food was great."}
{"text":"Vegans can't trust the menu. Dishes that have butter are noted as vegan, as is a dish with \"paneer\" in the name (cheese). Newby servers aren't much help navigating through the mistakes. A for good intentions, but F for execution. The owner is super nice, but I've been put off by some of the other help, especially if you arrive without a reservation. The food is among the best found, and I would give an additional star if the service was stronger, and another star if the menu had less mistakes."}
{"text":"Good place. The food is delicious and authentic. The Indian market next door is cool. Lots of stuff from India."}
{"text":"We purchased a Groupon for The Dhaba, as avid Indian food lovers, we figured we would make the drive out to the east valley and give it a shot. The restaurant is very small, so I would definitely recommend reservations. Though small it had a great ambiance, and the presentation was just lovely. Their varieties of chutneys were delicious and they had a great selection of Indian foods that are not so common to find in restaurants. We ordered several appetizers, a couples of entrees, and a few desserts and absolutely everything was delicious, fresh, and well prepared. The wait staff was friendly and attentive, and a gentlemen who seemed to be the owner checked in with us towards the end of the meal to make sure our experience was satisfactory.  All and all we had a great experience. We live pretty far from Tempe, so The Dhaba may not be our go-to Indian place, but when we are on that side of the city we will definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"My date surprised me by bringing me here for Valentines Day dinner with a reservation. We were promptly seated but it took a while for someone to come around to get us drinks / take our order. They had a special on this day: for $60 per couple, they offered 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert along with naan, rice, wine and chai. We decided to go for that and selected chicken pakoras for the appetizer, chicken tikka masala and vegetable korma for the entrees, and mango kulfi for dessert.  While we waited for our appetizers, we were brought papadums with tamarind chutney, green chutney, and a very spicy red chutney. All three chutneys were significantly different from each other and absolutely delicious. We were off to a great start as the chicken pakoras arrived not much later. I personally thought they weren't all that impressive, just pieces of lightly seasoned chicken, fried but they did taste okay with the chutneys.  I will say considering how good the chutneys were, I'd be interested in trying the samosa chaat at this restaurant.  Next, the chicken tikka masala & vegetable korma, rice and naan all took much longer to come out; at that point, we were really hungry and anxious to get started on eating. I had ordered the entrees at medium spiciness and when I took the first few bites of both dishes, I knew this wasn't a very wise decision. Their medium would be what I would consider hot since my mouth was instantaneously on fire. Being able to just barely dip the naan and rice in the curries was a big letdown. I did order some raita to go with my meal after I made sure that they don't put diced chilies in it like some restaurants do. That helped a bit but again, it was not so great that I wasn't able to fully enjoy my meal. Also, I thought it was absurd to be charged $4 for a small bowl of raita. Also a comment about the naan: the first one we got was a little bit burnt on the top and it was made really flat and crunchy instead of soft and fluffy. The second one was a little bit better but still, I think it could have been better.  Lastly, we were brought out dessert with the chai. The chai was good but again the kulfi wasn't impressive at all. It didn't have any kind of mango taste and almost just tasted like ice. We had gotten some chocolate wine as well as part of the special. I'm not sure exactly what it was but we thought it basically just tasted like Bailey's.  I will say that if we return, we would most likely not do any specials. We felt that we could've done with skipping the appetizers (unless trying the chaat) and dessert. Instead, we would probably order two entrees with two naans and rice. I think that would've been the perfect portion for our dinner on this night and would've cost us half the amount of money."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Indian restaurants in the valley. We ordered lamb curry and chicken masala - both dishes were pretty good. However the spiciness consistency was a bit off. We ordered both dishes at the same spiciness level but got different results.   The location is fairly close to ASU. The parking is somewhat limited so I would avoid rush hour/busy times."}
{"text":"Went here for New Years Eve and had a great experience! They food was VERY TASTY and the staff was very friendly. The owner definitely takes pride in his business and was super helpful. Our server was so/so but overall the food won us over."}
{"text":"The Dhaba is perfect, I could leave it at that... but I wont. The atmosphere is nice I love their cutlery and plates and tables. My husband and I love their Papdi Chatt appetizer, chicken tikka masala is amazing and another dish with spinach an chicken, sorry,  drawing a blank on the name. Every time we have been there our experience has been wonderful.   I will add one note, I am hoping this was just a fluke, but the last time we were in the owners were not there and the young Indian girl working there had on club music so loud I could not here my husband speak. At first I thought ok they just opened maybe they'll turn it off. Nope it played loudly the whole time. Also the bus girl and the Indian girl just disappeared we needed water and there was no one around, we waited 15 minutes plus for someone to get us our check, we actually had to stop the girl to ask for the check because she just kept walking by.  With this being said, we still love the Dhaba, and will continue visiting often. However if this ever happens again we might have to consider finding another place to get our Indian food."}
{"text":"I wish I could leave 10 stars. The food was beyond amazing, the hospitality even better. Raveen is by far the most beautiful, humble man I have ever met. This was the best dinner experience I have had, I cannot wait to return. Fantastic job to Raveen's amazing staff."}
{"text":"The food is really good and pretty plentiful here. We've had one really good experience, and a handful of okay experiences after that. We probably won't be coming back anymore.   Pros: - Delicious food, and free rice refills. Two dishes & naan here is enough to fill two people up, with leftovers to take home. - Adjustable spicy levels, for people who want things really hot or really mild. - Fun vibe with pretty good decor. - Sometimes you get a free dessert here if you check in on Yelp!  Cons: - Our water has always been dirty here (it has visible dust and hair in it), which is really gross. - Iffy service. No one comes to check on you after you've gotten your food, and you have to flag people down pretty dramatically if you need something. - They need better seating - when we came here most recently, for my birthday, they stuck us in the back corner, right by the kitchen, and we had to yell over the sound of sorting silverware, clanging pots, etc. Servers bumped into our table and into us multiple times because the table was just too big to be smashed into the corner. - Pricier than its competitors. It's not super expensive, but for this price, I expect better service, and a better overall experience.  Be warned - the spice level is pretty intense. I like hot food, and can handle medium to spicy at most other places, but a 4 (out of 10) is good for me here.  If you don't mind the hit-or-miss experiences here, the food is very good. It's just up to you on whether that's worth the experience and prices."}
{"text":"This food is so good, everything orderd has been delicious..Every chicken dish is Great. I cant stop coming back , I'm always craving Dhaba ..You must give it a try..with the NAN bread and yogurt for the rice and sauce..MmMMmM"}
{"text":"Tasty yet overpriced (except at lunch). Also carefully look at your bill! They hide the fact that they add 18% gratuity for themselves by making it look like part of the total amount you must pay, not an itemized suggested amount.   Pros: Great variety with a lot of dishes Good lunch prices Tasty dishes no matter what you order Beautiful ambience  Cons: Dinner prices are higher than most Indian places Some staff can be truculent if you do or ask for anything that apparently isn't to her liking Deceitful w/ bills  (As mentioned above, they print very archaic-looking bills w/ only numbers so you must remember exactly what you ordered and what it cost. But read it carefully!! It is itemized first by food & drink, then food & drink + tax, then food & drink + tax + 18% tip. So it's easy to assume the number at the bottom is your total WITHOUT TIP, which leads most people to double tip them unknowingly. I've seen my coworkers miss this every time. Makes me really wonder if they aren't intentionally making their bills cryptic and confusing... )"}
{"text":"I have been to The Dhaba three separate times now. The food is good, but certainly not the best Indian deliciousness I have tasted. The wait staff is friendly, the service was good, and the decor and cleanliness were both very good too. However, I think The Dhaba is overpriced compared to the small portion sizes. I really was expecting more for the money than what I got. Also, I am a fan of spicy foods and really hate it when ethnic restaurants mild down their spiciness levels when serving to American eaters (call it a pet peeve of mine). Each time I ordered here they of course asked me how spicy I wanted my meal (1-10 stars) and I told them \"10 stars, extra, extra spicy please!\" However, what ended up on my plate was maybe about 3 stars... very mild compared to what I like and what I was expecting. That left me very disappointed so after my third attempt, I decided that this would in fact NOT become a regular ethnic eating place for me. The flavors are good, but the heat is missing."}
{"text":"This was my first Indian food experience so I don't have anything to compare their food to, however, what we ordered was delicious!  I had the Chicken Marsala and my friend had a lamb dish.  We also ordered garlic naan.  Everything was excellent!!  The restaurant is smaller than I expected, but it seems well managed and service was quick.  If you check in you get a free desert offer.  Unfortunately, I didn't notice it on my phone until after we left.  I'll have to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few Indian restaurants here in the valley - namely Jewel of the Crown, Al Hamra, Tandoori Times, Bombay Spice Grill & Wine (not really Indian), Indian Paradise, and Kabab Palace - and Dhaba is definitely my favorite so far. I'm no stranger to the cuisine having travelled/lived in India & Bangladesh for a couple of years, and this place seems to have nailed the perfect balance of flavor, spice, variety, ambiance, price, and service. The hostess/server was warm and knowledgeable, the bussers were attentive (my water was always at least  full), and the food was delicious. A little Americanized, perhaps, but muted authenticity didn't affect the taste or my dining experience at all. I highly recommend getting the garlic naan and goat curry (ask for additional heat; it can be a little sweet otherwise). And good ol' chicken tikka masala for first-timers. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The Dhaba is a favorite of mine. The food here is remarkable! It's chef is highly trained and the restaurant itself has received tons of awards. I have tried many different entrees and appetizers but a favorite is the chickenTikka Masala with saffron basmati rice and a side of garlic naan to dip into the glorious sauce. Eat here once and you will crave it forever!"}
{"text":"More expensive than other places in this college town, but the food IS tasty. I'm a fan of its meat dishes in general."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always enjoy each visit. First of all, when you walk in you get an inviting feeling from the smiles  and courteousness of the staff. You get to experience a bit of the culture with the lovely dining set they have and by the look of the decor. And of course, the many flavorful dishes that they offer! Their staff pays attention to the water level of your cup and ensures it is filled. That's an A+ :)  This time around I tried papadum which is a  starter. It looks like a tortilla but the texture is a light tortilla chip made of lentil powder, rice powder and some different spices. You can practically eat these non-stop!   Favorites/Chicken/Tandoors/Bread/Dessert: - Rahon dal tarka which is yellow lentils mixed with different herbs and spices. You can eat this with their saffron cumin rice.  - Gudaspuri Mutter Paneer which is blended mix of peas and cheese along with the dhaba herbs and spices. Great for trying to fulfill the veggie part of your daily food intake! ;) palak paneer (spinach and cheese) is also good.  - Gazab Ka Kadahi Murgh which is a BBQ boneless chicken marinated in a spicy yogurt. This is my new favorite dish because it's baked in their clay oven. Once cooked then its marinated in the yogurt sauce and mixed with onions, bell peppers and tomato to create a wonderful sauce.  - Tandoori Murgh (chicken) cooked in the clay oven paired with onions and a squeeze of lemon.  - Pani Puri which is small finger foods. \"Street food\"  Little chip-like texture cups filled with potatoes and chick peas. Pour the mint water in the filled cups and add an optional taramind sauce or mint sauce.  - Garlic Naan is hands down my favorite garlic naan I have tasted!! If you're wanting garlic naan then come here to eat it. It's soft  ,airy, fluffy with the right amount of crispness on the edges and amount of garlic shavings on top!  - Ras Malai (sweet condensed milk cheese circular chunks) homemade dessert. Think of fresh mozzarella cheese texture. Really soft clean texture mixed in with the condensed milk cream sauce.  - Halwa which is a Carrot fudge (sweet cooked carrot shavings boiled in condensed milk mixed with hints of pistachios, cashews, and golden raisins. Really innovative for a homemade dessert!   Overall I loved this place because I can always select new dishes as well as favorite dishes to eat and I can always expect great friendly service from their staff. Gotta come check this place out! Mmm mmm gooddd! Only thing I regret was not taking pics of the delicious foods!! Next time. ;)"}
{"text":"this place does not deliver. very flakey  and poor quality food. do not get this terrible indian food"}
{"text":"The best indian food I have ever had. The service is always amazing. I come here on a monthly basis and it is always consistant. When we crave traditional indian food, we come here!"}
{"text":"We are perplexed by the 4 star reviews of this place. We ordered their eggplant curry and tandoori chicken, and neither of them matched the description provided nor were they made to specifications. Eggplant was ridiculously spicy when we had specifically specified 'mild'. Tandoori chicken didn't even have salt and tasted stale. Even the rice was dry!  Customer service was weird, the cashier got grumpy when we asked for the receipt and gave us a dirty look. All in all a terrible restaurant experience.... NOT ordering here ever again.."}
{"text":"We usually eat Indian food at a buffet in Mesa, but an Indian friend took me to Dhaba and it was amazing.   I took my family soon after and they were impressed too. The meat was more tender than what we usually get at our favorite buffet. (Not saying our favorite place is not great.  It's the best buffet I have ever been to and I usually hate buffets.)  The naan was very good, but kind of expensive for such a small amount.    Almost every dish was absolutely wonderful.  We ordered lamb vindaloo, lamb curry and chicken curry.   I also ordered something that was supposed to have cubed potatoes and spinach.  It was tasty, but there were hardly any potatoes and it was really just spinach.   Being that I am not Indian and am still learning about the foods I like, I would find it helpful to have images (I realize that sounds silly) or better descriptions.  No one in my party wanted to touch the spinach plate because it looked weird, but I thought it was delicious--just did not want to eat the whole thing.  Being that I do not know what to order, I will probably stick with our usual buffet because I can tell by looking at the dish if I will like it.  The waitress was not great at understanding my questions about menu items.    Still, the food was good, and I will probably visit with my Indian friend again because the stuff she ordered was great."}
{"text":"The Dhaba is a little far from us, but since we were in Tempe we stopped in and were glad we did.  I loved the Saag Paneer -- it had just the right amount of kick and the cheese was spongy and not hard.  The naan was good, as was the rice, and my husband liked his Lamb Vindaloo.  The chai was also very good, and made even better by the free refills. :)   We didn't have any problems with service at all; to the contrary, even though there were only two staff members there, everyone was polite and attentive.  Why just three stars, you ask?  I knocked it two points for the portion size relative to the price.  I'm willing to pay more for quality food, sure, but it'd be nice if there was at least more of it.  The food was very good, but I think other Indian restaurants have comparable quality food for more reasonable prices.  The store next door is a lot of fun to browse, and if you're out to get fed for cheap, try their web site or Restaurant.com before you go -- both usually have coupons."}
{"text":"Very good food. Some of the best and most authentic I have ever had. My only complaint is the service. It is always slow and server never is really busy. The place is small and I have never seen more than 4 tables full inside. However, it takes forever to order, get a refill, or get the check.   Hire a better server and this place might get a 5 star from me.   (I have been here to eat several times, and the service is bad every time. I keep coming because the food is so delic."}
{"text":"I went here last night to use my new living social deal.  The decor is really great down to an awesome place setting, copper cup and copper silverware.  I called ahead and made a resey for a Tuesday night and when we arrived there was a reserved sign on the front table.  Really nice touch - we got the best table in the house.  The food was really good.  We ordered the vegdy appetizer platter, veggy meatball dish (skip this), garlic nan, and butter chicken.  Everything was delicious and not at all spicy.  I think the usual Indian buffets make things really spicy so you eat less, here I couldn't eat anymore b/c I was stuffed.   I would be remiss if I didn't give a special kudo to the man who brought out our food and filled our drinks.  Best Guy Ever."}
{"text":"31/2 really. I tried Dhaba for the first time today. I ordered the chicken tikka masala which was good and garlic naan which was ok. They deliver so that's always a plus for me. I'm looking forward to trying some other things."}
{"text":"We came here over the weekend after my husband had a craving for Indian food and found The Dhaba online and said it had the best reviews he had seen for Indian food near us. We drove out from Gilbert and found the restaurant easily.   Upon entering the restaurant, we saw they had about 15 tables, and about 3 of them had guests. A few had \"reserved\" signs on them. The woman at the front (I believe she and her husband are the owners, she also took our order) asked immediately if we had a reservation, and we did not. She made it seem like it would be very difficult to get us a table, despite the relative emptiness of the restaurant when we arrived. A minute or two later we were able to be seated.   The place settings were impressive with the heavy brass cups and brass-accented silverware. We ordered our favorites (garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo), and the food came out very fast. I have a low spicy tolerance and ordered my food at a \"2\" and it seemed more like what I would call a \"5\" - I would have loved a larger water cup while I was eating, but man was it delicious (though no one should ask me to be a spice judge!). I thought the cart they used to bring the food out was a little weird, and with the napkins clipped on to it, it seemed very unimpressive in a very otherwise impressive setting. Some of the staff could be friendlier, but that didn't take away from the food, and I even brought my leftover sauce home and cooked more chicken (and added some plain yogurt to temper the spice for this weakling) for leftovers! We will be back (we both like quality Indian food, and The Dhaba certainly delivered!), but we'll be sure to make a reservation next time. :)"}
{"text":"I went there this weekend.Though the place is smaller and there is only one common washroom(ughh), we really enjoyed the food.we had tandoori chicken,naan,kadai chicken and mango lassi.But i must say the price is a bit high than other places."}
{"text":"Yummy! Had Macca di roti and sarson ka sag after a long time and it was great! I highly recommend this dish to my non-indian friends. For a change and some authentic punjabi taste.   The spice levels were good and service friendly. I m going back every time I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. They have great affordable lunch specials, perfect for students and everyone is very pleasant and nice. The rice pudding dessert is amazing !! Will definitely be coming back again !"}
{"text":"I ate here today with a group of 7 of us. We order the Punjab Veggie Platter and Tandoori Khazana as appetizers, which are sampler plates containing samosas, veggie and paneer pakora, shrimp, tandoori chicken and some kind of kebab (veggies on one and meat on the other). Everything on the veggie platter was great. I only tried the tandoori chicken from the other platter and found it a bit dry, every everyone else seemed to love everything on the plate so maybe it was just me.   I got the Chicken Makhani with a spice level of 6. It was absolutely phenomenal, as was the garlic (BUTTERY) naan we got for the table. FYI that 6 wasn't spicy to me so it's definitely on an American scale. There is no way the calories they quote are correct, but I probably don't want to see the real ones.   The prices are a little high, but the portions are large and the food was very high quality. I would not hesitate to come back."}
{"text":"The best chicken tikka masala ive ever had! loved the food n the utensils n cups n plates are made out of copper very nice touch!"}
{"text":"Do not recommend, poor quality and pricey. Not authentic Indian. The tandoori chicken was not cooked well, the biryani tasted like sambar rice and curry chicken had to be sent back."}
{"text":"OMG BEST INDIAN FOOD IN PHOENIX!!!! Seriously there's not much else to say. Ever since we tried The Dhaba we can't stop talking about it and have been back numerous times. The food is so flavorful, perfectly seasoned & spicy in the best way!!!  Such a great find. If you like Indian food please try it! One thing to note is that seating is very limited, so a reservation is prudent. They also offer take out if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"When you walk in, you feel like you are in India. I mean the plates, cups, and silver ware are all scary to eat off of. They are all metal and have dents and holes in them, making them seem dirty. The fork and silver ware was already placed on the table. I had to wipe off my fork before I used it. One thing that I warn is do not drink the water there. It tastes like it is fresh out of that man made Tempe man made beach. The server was an asian lady who kind of had an attitude. The food was ok and I hope that it is not the best Indian food in Phoenix. It's worth going to but it is very dirty and a bit scary. I wonder what the kitchen looks like?"}
{"text":"After dining here a couple of more times, I would have to give this restaurant 3.5 stars. The chicken tikka was VERY DISAPPOINTING. It was not served on a sizzling clay plate as it should be. The chicken did not taste grilled.  It was microwaved and served on a plate. The flavor was also lacking. Honestly, this is very amateurish and they simply cannot serve tandoor like this.  Also, the water was not served chilled with ice, it was served tapwater temperature and thus your thirst didn't feel quenched.  The vegetarian sabjis outside of palak panner and malai kofta was average.   Again, I dined here two more times after this and the quality of the food took a dip."}
{"text":"I love the look of the place, the food was tasty but way to spicy for me. I ordered very little spice and it was so spicy that I could barely eat any of it. Gonna try it again in the future and ask for no spice and see what happens. The chicken was nice and juicy instead of dried out like a lot of places tend to be. Oh and it was a little too warm inside, but that coulda just been the day we went."}
{"text":"I took the advice below me on yelp and made a reservation. We came in ten minutes early and our table was all ready and set to go. The service was pretty good, which I was thankful for because the reviews below me scared me. However, it was 530, pretty early for a Saturday night so it was not busy.   We ordered some garlic naan, the lamb boti kabab, and the gosht rogan josh (another lamb dish). The naan was tasty and warm. The lamb kabob was amazing! The pieces of lamb were HUGE and super tasty. The gosht rogan josh was extremely tasty as well, however I would have preferred more meat as opposed to so much curry along with it. However this food was amazing and by far the best Indian food I have had in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and each experience seems to get better than the last. The staff is so friendly and we got sat within minutes. The menu is expansive but easy to read! The naan is delicious and every curry I have had has been delicious. I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys authentic Indian food!"}
{"text":"Wasn't really a big fan of Indian food, but once every ten years or so, I can sample this type of food. Even if you order it level one, there is a chance of sweating. The spices don't burn, but they do linger for a bit. I can't pronounce what I ordered, but it involved chicken breast chunks in a heavy sauce with onions and peppers. The dish was good and so was the basmati rice which was included in the price of the entree. Otherwise, it is essential that you of course order the garlic Naan and that lived up to the hype with a light tough of garlic on soft bread. The mango lassi didn't taste too mangoey, but was a nice creamy cool down when things got hot. Check-in on Yelp for a free rice pudding which has some hidden raisins and nuts buried inside. The place is on the outskirts of a shady neighborhood, but as far as Indian food goes, it was a good new experience."}
{"text":"Best indian food in Phoenix by far. Get the chicken saag!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The chicken curry was on point. The Naan bread was a little crispy but that just made it even more tasty. It's a bit pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"I walked into this place thinking: \"Oh man, you know the Americans(white dudes) are going to love this place\"  Flat screen tv's, nice tables, friendly service, trendy ambience, waiters who speak good English, white guy playing sitar at the front....this is white guys paradise...unfortunately the food itself was just above average. FYI, Indians from India (my parents) call all white dudes \"Americans\" as if we are not Americans but I thought would throw some humor your way in case you were already bored reading the typical \"The spiciness wasn't there\" review  In terms of the menu, I don't think Dhaba knows how it's trying to position itself. Are they a chaat house, a classic Indian restaurant, a fusion Indian restaurant....and that is the problem with this place, it's  a smorgasboard...a jack of all trades yet a master of none.  And that's exactly felt in the cuisine. The samosa chaat was amazing, the other chaat....bleh!  The chicken tikka masa was very good but the certainly not crave-worthy meaning  it lacked the\"Hey I'm dying for some great chicken tikka masala, let me order this to go\" quality. It's really hit or miss with their dishes as some are completely amateur like their chicken tikka(not the curry but the grilled version) which tasted like chicken cooked on a Forman grill and was then allowed to cool to room temperature and served on a plate...not exactly appetizing. Their daal was really good but their saag was okay.  And to Wendi below, we don't eat salads.  Indian people created salads for you guys. So when you tell me there is a new salad on the menu each day, I envision someone at a Chinese restaurant saying we are offering a different style of pizza today. That's a not a good thing. If the guy is listening to Pink Floyd, that means the dial is moving even further away on the authentic meter. What's next, are they going to start offerring hooka and child's chicken finger and fries plate? Don't get me wrong, Dhaba is one of the few Indian restaurants in Phoenix that I will actually dine at since most are terrible and that's not me being critical. Phoenix is a great place for bad Indian restaurants to thirve since the population is clueless when it comes to Indian food and you could seriously serve up some ground beef with curry and give it a name and they would think it's a legitimate and authentic dish...and this goes for the white dudes living in London who comes on these forums and tells us they know great Indian food when they give places like India Gate 5 stars....but I digress. Okay so if you are not an Indian food snob and want to break out of your routine of eating at Black Angus, this is a good place to start. If you have eaten great Indian food and are not easily mesmerized by a nice atmosphere go down McClintock and take a left on Broadway and try Royal Taj"}
{"text":"While the food was definitely high quality, I found it a little overpriced. I have had my share of Indian food and while it was certainly delicious, there's no reason for the jacked up prices.  Service was OK but we did have to remind them for water refills and they also forgot the extra chutney sauce we asked for.  Samosa chaat: ok but underwhelming. Definitely overpriced. They are stingy with the amount of samosa and it could have used more tamarind chutney and yogurt.  Dhaba chicken curry: my least favorite. Not flavorful and really boring. Maybe if I asked for the dish to be extra spicy it would have tasted better.  Dhaba lamb curry: decent! We ordered it mild but it had a deep hearty flavor.  Kashmiri chicken tikka masala: the star of the night! I ordered it to be 10/10 spicy but it was more like 3/10 spicy. Still delicious and my absolute favorite.   Rice pudding: very yummy and a nice way to end the meal. This was the free dessert that came with the Yelp check in deal. I was expecting gulab jamun honestly but this was  a nice surprise.  Again, like I stated, none of the dishes were bad. In fact, they were very high quality and the talent of the chef is evident. I'm just highly turned off by the fact that the portion sizes are so small despite being $16-$18 per entree. The samosa chaat appetizer alone was $8 and it was tiny with very few samosa pieces.  The restaurant itself was very cozy and felt authentic."}
{"text":"The tikka masala is to die for.  Love the food here.  The staff is also super patient about explaining the menu.  This is far from home but I'll still make the journey.  I hav dreams about the tikka masala."}
{"text":"Service was great but I found that the food did not have much taste. The Naan was burnt and the chicken Tikka boti was very dry and had a odd smell."}
{"text":"If you're frantically looking for a restaurant for an anniversary or a hot date, then this is the perfect place to take your significant other. The Dhaba is a classy, affordable, and romantic venue. This is definitely one of the top Indian restaurants in Tempe and is about as good as it gets anywhere.   The service is fantastic, when we arrived the host greeted us and seated us at a table while setting down a few roses. I felt extremely welcomed by the restaurant host anywhere, and from the get-go I knew that this was going to be a great experience.  As for the food, it was delicious. I had the chicken tika masala (I tend to order the plainest items at ethnic restaurants) and it was cooked to perfection. The waitress was very attentive and made sure that we were completely satisfied with our order.   Just make sure to make reservations, as this place is quick to fill up at dinner."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian food I had in whole of USA.  The ambience is very traditional and contemporary.  Since I and my family are a big fan of appetizers,  we tried all kinds that were available there with naan and they were all simple amazing (Lehsuni kebab, chicken tikka,  fish tikka,  panner tikka etc) The service was very good and accurate. We were a big group of people ( around 10),  the hostess took order with ease and there was no mix up in food. Servers served food with a smile,  which made food even more appetizing :)   Mango lassi is a must. I would definitely come to this place again to satisfy my Indian food cravings :)"}
{"text":"Food service was horrible . We were travelling to phoenix and happen to go there for dinner , we ordered 2 Thali (vaishnovi) ($15.00 each) . First the server serve us the papad with chutney which was good . Than the other lady (lady in black) came up with the food , she serve the food , I asked her to change my spoons because she kept the my old one on the table without asking me , in reply she said you can use the old one , I told her can you please give me new one , first she argued and than she brought the other one . she was rude . In thali , there was dal ( half cooked ) , korma , rice , and naan . I found food quality was not up to standard . She later brought the sweet and masala chai (with no masala in there ) - I asked her if they have brown sugar - in reply she said we only have these sugar whatever its in tray  , just find it by urself . I FOUND THEM RUDE , NO FOOD QUALITY , DEFINATELY NOT GOING AGAIN , AND WILL NOT RECOMMENT ANY ONE ."}
{"text":"We went once and that will be the last.  With only 4 other tables occupied, service was very slow.  The waitress was not friendly.  The naan tasted like a pita bread in a fast food restaurant.  The food is similar to other Indian restaurants, prices slightly higher. We went to their gift shop and found out that their spices are three to four times more expensive than Haji Baba or other Middle Eastern delis."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend for chaat (snack) and chai.  We had the Bombay Bhel Puri and the Amritsri Samosa Chaat.  The samosa dish was perfectly cooked and everything was nice and spicy."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad. The atmosphere is nice, and the staff seems friendly enough, but they are getting three stars for a couple reasons.  First when we finally ordered, it took quite a while for our food to come out. Also when we ordered, we ordered some drinks... Normally those would come out before the food...? So, yeah, when our food came out and we still didn't have drinks, I had to ask twice for them.  Second, I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masalla, one of my all time favorite Indian dishes, if done right. This dish came out under seasoned, no real flavor whatsoever... plus I really like spicy food, so I ordered it as a 10 (scale of 1 to 10)... Unfortunately it didn't taste like they had done anything to spice it up.  Last, the rice pudding was... ok. However, they apparently leave whole cardamon seeds in there, and I happen to bite full on into one thinking it was one of the nuts in the pudding. My wife had some ice-cream desert that tasted like a Mango Lassie, but it was so rock solid and in a dish that just didn't work. Trying to dig pieces of the ice-cream off ended with the entire puck (that's about what it looked like) flying out of the small bowl they put it in.  On the plus side, the Garlic Naan was fabulous... in fact we got a second order of it...   Anyhow, I doubt I'll come back here again, especially if I can find a much better Indian place closer to Chandler..."}
{"text":"A perfect little gem! Food was amazing, service was great and did I mention the food??? We started with the paneer pakore with curried chickpeas and oh my god! So good and not too filling. I ordered the spicy butter chicken and my date ordered the curried chicken. We were both in heaven.   I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First off the food is fantastic and soo delicious. However, they fall short on a few areas I'm not happy with. First, with all the spices they are cooking with, they have extremely poor air circulation hence you smelling like what you and the restaurant order by the time you walk out. And that scent is so strong that I couldn't even cover it with perfume and I always put my hair up prior entering knowing I'd smell after! Secondly, they skimped me on the rice. I usually go in by myself and order one entree, that's fine. BUT! I was really hungry one day and ordered two entrees to myself both were supposed to come with white rice. They came out with both entrees and the SAME amount of rice as when I usually order one entree with rice. When asked they said I could pay extra which I found inconsiderate because I ordered a SECOND dish that is supposed to come with its own side of rice. They generally serve the rice in one bowl, which is fine, but they did not put any more rice in that rice bowl than they did when I came and ordered one entree! I was extremely disappointed when I left that day. I had to go to trader joes to buy some extra naan for the second entree... :( I also cannot say the two women always working there were the nicest or most hospitable of servers."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!!! I ordered Sarson ka saag and Makki ki roti and it was really authentic taste as we get in Punjab. I highly recommend this Indian restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"We booked our reservation here through Open Table, so our expectations were high. This restaurant is situated in small strip mall in the old part of Tempe AZ. It's not a high end Indian restaurant but the food it pretty good for the price.  $47 for two vs. $100+ for two at Clay Pot in Irvine CA.  I think Dhaba could use a interior design makeover. And ditch the 60\" flat screen TV. This is not a sports bar."}
{"text":"My first time having Indian  cuisine..  My Son and his girlfriend took me here for dinner and when they were making the food, it smelled so good I could hardly wait.   I  wasn't disappointed, it was wonderful.  The servers were very attentive and friendly.  I really loved the atmosphere too.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Food was great and service was better than the last time I came to The Dhaba. I recommend trying the Chicken Wings on the appetizer menu.   Good job!"}
{"text":"Weekday dinner. Staff was friendly. Food overall was ok. I've had a lot of indian food. May be for a person who's new to the cuisine may find it better. Lamb curry which came with Maharaj Thali was good. so was the garlic naan. So mey be that's what I should have ordered."}
{"text":"Definitively one of the best Indian restaurants we have visited on the west coast. With a Punjab spicy flare and many family style choices The Dhaba is worth the visit. It is a family run business who's main goal is to serve you an excellent meal. If I had to find one minor issue it would be the parking lot as its tight and there is a hairpin turn to enter the lot.  My favorite dish is the Dhaba Lamb Korma w/ a salted Lassi"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend.  I had the Bhatinda lamb special. Very good.   The portion was modest (but fine for the avg. appetite in context with the other stuff), and the price included naan, rice, and a couple of other sides.  My friend ordered a vindaloo dish, which was a tad more in price and was just the curry. For him, the rice/naan was an add-on. It was a larger serving, but I think he felt a tad confused due to the different offerings included in my order.   Also, he felt it was pretty mild, though the menu and waiter mentioned it would be spicy hot. We mentioned this to the manager and he said that requesting more heat was an easy thing for them to do. So if you like to sweat when eating vindaloo (and other Indian fare), just be sure to make it clear when ordering.   In any case, it was a first visit so I'm not sure which are the best things to order and if ordering a combination - what is the best plan. I would venture to guess, however, that it would be a great place to go with a small group, then order a variety of things and share."}
{"text":"Good Indian food. I haven't had that many different dishes in my five visits, but I have never had a bad meal. The naan is great. The lamb vindaloo is spicy. The chicken tikka masala is tasty. One oddity is the water they serve. It tastes... funky. Like it is well water."}
{"text":"The worst indian food i have ever eaten. Ordered paneer tikka masala and i could tell right on the first bite that it was cooked out of a ready-to-eat packet. Absolutely no flavor. Just something on my plate that i had to eat!  I didn't pay so much for that! Worst food. Overly unnecessarily pricey for the quality and taste of food. Weird woman taking orders. Bad place for indian food. Avoid!"}
{"text":"The food at The Dhaba deserves about 2 or 2.5 stars based on food alone. It's not bad, but it's also not that great. My husband and I got the 2-item thali plates, so we tasted 4 of their curries in total. Like other reviewers noted, the food is \"meh.\" \"The main problem is that that the dishes are extremely bland. I love Indian food to have rich spices, textures, tastes....this seemed watered down.  The decor of The Dhaba is about 4 stars. It's very nicely decorated. The restaurant is small, but well laid out.   The service is about 4-stars as well. Our waitress was prompt, and courteous. The only difficulty is that she was very soft-spoken (ie., a low-talker).  On several occasions, we asked her to repeat herself.   Overall, \"meh\" with nice decor."}
{"text":"I don't understand how the place has got such nice reviews. Just landed in Arizona and thought of trying something based on reviews.  The place is not even worth 1 star.  We ordered lahsuni chicken kabab, Punjabi chole, biryani and naan.  The Chicken kabab seemed like an old boiled chicken tossed on stove on order. It did not taste or look like barbecued. We did mention the same to the owner but she denied it blatantly. Additionally they added some awful color which is not even added to a lahsuni kabab.  The Punjabi chole was not at all made with Punjabi spices. Moreover the chole was not properly boiled.  Everything seemed to be stale, heated and brought. over. The only thing edible enough was biryani."}
{"text":"This is my all-time favorite Indian place! I've never been disappointed by a meal at the Dhaba. This is the food I crave when I'm pregnant! The restaurant is very small, however it is worth the wait when it is crowded! They also do take out. I have dropped off my car at the Honda mechanic that is behind this restaurant, ordered my food and by the time I get to the restaurant it is ready. The chicken korma is amazing and the garlic naan is plentiful!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my wife and ordered roghan gosh and chicken makhani. the food was delicious. We complimented this meal with Onion and special Naan, which was an excellent choice. No complaints about the food at all. My wife ordered mango lassi which she thoroughly enjoyed. We have been to other indian restaurants in the southeast valley and we definitely rate as one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my trip to The Dhaba.  I have never eaten Indian food before so my wife wanted me to try it, because she loves it so much.  We ordered a veggie platter, which was amazing.  The fried onion treats were exceptional.  The chicken tikka masala was also very good.    Unfortunately the lamb boti kabab was very disappointing.  It was so dry and tasteless, no joke it was like boot leather.  I even asked the waitress if it was supposed to be that dry and she said, \"everything here is well done,\" but quite honestly that was a disgrace.  Lamb should be moist and delicious this was like steak that you get at Denny's at 2:30am.  As a side note there gulab jamun was breath taking.  I'm not a desert guy but I would suggest this to anyone try.  The Dhaba is on http://www.restaurant.com/ so you can get a great discount and I would give the green light to try it just don't order the lamb."}
{"text":"The 4 stars was because service was a little slow but the food was definitely WORTH IT. The man who is a host there is so welcoming and attentive. Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I have eaten Indian food at several restaurants and I truly believe this is the best I've had. It is very flavorful, authentice cuisine. Everytime I have had Indian food somewhere else after eating here, I have been disappointmed. Although it takes a while to place an order and receive your food, it is clearly family owned and operated so I don't even mind."}
{"text":"We loved the food here - awesome!  We had two different curry dishes that we shared.  Like all the other indian restaurants I go to, the service is very poor.  The food is so good though, i'll probably go back.  I'm used to slow service when i eat indian food, so that usually isn't a deal breaker for me.  I would highly recommend a reservation because this place is small."}
{"text":"pretty scrumptious.  we had so much food it was nuts. my friend had a restaurants.com coupon so we went to town.   we ordered the takki nakki (jk i dont remember the name) it was potato pancake with onions and other amazing things. it was so insanely good...you must get it. it's one of the most recommended things in the yelp reviews and it's a starter so look for it.   then we ordered the chicken fritters. they were basically like indian style chicken nuggets. curry and mango served with a garbanzo bean dipping sauce. pretty good.  then we ordered the full experience meal. it came with chicken tandoori, indian style fried rice (amazing), chicken or lamb curry, a salad, a dessert (we got one of both and the rice pudding was the way to go) and chai tea.  i loved the little crispy thing they served before our meals with sauces. so amazing.   we also ordered garlic naan which was amazing.   the service was weird. there's a girl who fills up your water but she doesn't answer any questions. you have to wait for the hostess/waitress. she was super sweet but it was slow.   once you order, the food comes quickly and there is just so much food. if you like bland food, don't come here you boring white person! jk. kinda. be advernturous"}
{"text":"Before beginning with my review, I would like to critic (!!) on something that I read through a lot of reviews here for \"The\" Dhaba...  \" There is no f* variable Spice level in Indian food... \" I get enraged when people say these things as if these are the conventions for food... Most of the Indian recipes ( 99% at least ) are prepared with a predetermined spice level... \" How do you want your food, mild medium or spicy ? \" is the dumbest thing I have come across in my entire restaurant life... there are some recipes that are supposed to be SPICY and some are supposed to be Medium and some Sweet... reason being Indian spices range way more than just Chilly for heaven's sake... Thai restaurants vary Spice level just by adding more Chili... Indian spices are way more than just chili and you can not add / subtract spices like Chili sauce since spices are added during the process of cooking and not on top as garnishing...   In short, \"Mild, Medium or Spicy\" is like asking what kind of a football player do you want for your team \" fast, faster or fastest \" .. well, quarterback position needs a fast player, tight ends could be faster but wide receivers need to be the fastest... but you can not f* switch and play the game !  All right... about the restaurant... my opinion is that if you wish to have real Indian food, you have to go to cities other than Phoenix (or even better, go to India... !)... I have been to some Indian restaurants in Houston, Washington DC, New York, San Diego, New Jersey and a few more places and all places have much better Indian restaurants than in our Valley... but if it comes to sticking to the choices we have around, I would rank \"The\" Dhaba as the most \"close to actual\" Indian food that you have get...  Jewel of the crown ranks probably the second... but overall, all Indian restaurants around here are good for some particular things on the Menu and worse for others...  Dhaba comes to being better for almost everything on the menu... Chicken tikka masala (butter chicken) related dishes are very good, all lamb dishes are nice and authenticated... vegetarian options are awfully limited compared to what it should be considering its an Indian restaurant... ( common restaurants in India have at least 40 more vegetarian items on their menu, no kidding !)  But overall I am very pleased with the range of quality here at The Dhaba.. garlic Naan's are way too good to resist... tea (complimentary) is very close to what people in India drink... almost all non-vegetarian dishes and paneer tikka masala or mixed vegetables are tasty... (somebody wrote about salads and I would like to remind that salads are not Indian because other green vegetables are very common in regular diets)...  and yeah... if you like Indian music, they have live music these days on the weekends, I guess... and though I have never been there for the music, I bet that would be cool...."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I think Dhaba is actually a 3.5 star.  The food was good, but not fantastic, the service was good but not superb, the pricing was reasonable, but not a steal.... Overall a pleasant experience, but not likely one I will repeat on my own accord.  In Dhaba's defense, they have a lot of competition when it comes to small Indian food places in the valley, so I can't give it a 4 compared to some of the excellence I've experienced at its competitors. My BF and I both tried the sampler platters, meat and vegetarian.  The salad we started off with was excellent, the dressing was fantastic and they had these crunchy balls on top, almost like a cereal.  The entrees were just okay, my masala was very good, but everything else I could have done without.  Also there was no spice whatsoever in any of the dishes, very disappointing.   The pricing was reasonable; I was surprised some of the reviews mentioned it was expensive.  I think Dhaba is probably a great place to start if you don't typically eat ethnic foods with a lot of flavor or spice.  We both left feeling satisfied, but like the meal was missing something."}
{"text":"It started off rocky.  The house salad was basically iceberg lettuce.  The green flour puffs were missing in action.  The service was unfriendly.  The experience went up from there.  The garlic naan was crisp and flavorful.  We ordered chicken vindaloo and chicken marsala, both medium spicy.  The marsala had white chicken.  The marsala had dark, one large piece was grisle.  The sauces were excellent and clearly homemade.  The nuts were prominent in the vindaloo.  The marsala creamy.  Due to Yelp we received complimentary rice pudding.  Yum, it had nuts and cardamom. Balancing everything, four stars."}
{"text":"The food here was good overall.  Portions were somewhat small for the price.  I may eat here again but it would probably be for the lunch buffet vs dinner.  For 2 people we spent 40.00 and did not get anything fancy or appetizers."}
{"text":"First of all the owner is AMAZING.  So welcoming, kind, and makes everyone feel at home.  The decor and setup is so cool. Unfortunately,  the food wasnt up to par. It was near closing time and even though there was no rush or anything, the food lacked taste and not enjoyable- i really was hoping it was. May try it out once more just because of the service and the want to support local businesses."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and the location is great since it is close to ASU. However, the service does not even get close to being okay! They should really reduce their prices for us to come back."}
{"text":"Worst Indian food ever. Got the maharaja thali .... There was nothing maharaja about it. Worst food ever .... No flavor, asked for spice level 8... Got zero. Had some kheema naan... Whatever was in the naan I wouldn't serve it to my dog. The thaali comes with chai and dessert they forgot that. Service was horrible food was disgusting. Stay way!!! The best thing they had was water."}
{"text":"Updating with an extra star because we went back today with a reservation at 6 and were sat immediately. The food was heaven and the korma was maybe even better than last time!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Indian food restaurant. I honestly never eat Indian food much but I will more often at The Dhaba by how freakin delicious it is.  My first time there, everything was clean and neat, the server was so polite and patient with me and my mom having no clue what anything on the menu is.   I liked how my server asked me on a scale from 1-10 how spicy do I want my food, I said 5 and it was just right.   I wish I knew what me or my mom ordered but I had a cheesy thin yellow sauce with a few vegetable dumplings in it with basmati rice and garlic naan. I got full on less than half of it which is strange because I usually almost finish my food at restaurants.  My mom had really tender chicken in very thin red sauce with bell pepper and onion sizzling on a hot pan. All of it was perfect, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Portions, pricing and wait time was ridiculous. The food saved this place. It was incredible. Lower the prices a bit and enlarge the dishes and I'll return."}
{"text":"I always enjoy a sqaure deal, and today was no exception. Having a shiny new restaurant*com coupon in hand, we made our way out for The Dhaba. I'm not too proud to partake in a coupon here and there. Let's face it, why pay $40 when you can spend $25 after tax and generous tip? Now that's smart shopping.  This place was a good decision. We really enjoyed the food, they're in a nice spot right off the light rail, they've got a cool Indian (dot - not feather) market and adjacent shops to check out before, or after, your meal.   The Adrak De Panje dish (marinated lamb cooked in the tandoor for those of you who don't know); while tasty, was a bit tougher than I was expecting. They could stand to provide a sharper knife with this item. I was here with my wife and mother-in-law and we all really enjoyed the Nawabi Murg Tikke (marinated chicken cooked in the tandoor).  Overall they serve great tasting food and India themed décor. The restaurant dining area echoed on the inside, which made for an interesting experience. We could literally hear what our neighbors were talking about. While they did have music it could have been a bit louder, felt like we could hear every conversation from all the surrounding tables. and I expect that this could have been overcome with ambiance level music or some interior curtains.  At one of the shops, we met an interesting and awesome guy behind the counter, my guess is that he's the owner. He told us about different spices and dietary info about different Indian foods. Had a fun evening learning about Indian foods!  Happy Yelping Phoenix! .... errr Tempe I guess. ;-)"}
{"text":"The good:  Reasonably clean and well lit. The owner and hostess are very pleasant and attentive. Pricing is mediocre.  Time waiting for food is acceptable.  The bad:  Our waitress had the personality of a paper sack, didn't ever ask me if I wanted another beverage.  No smile, just deadpan.  Food was overcooked and dry (Tandoori platter).  I shall try another INdian restaurant before I would go back."}
{"text":"I've had a number of poor experiences with this place I'd like to highlight.   The food is good, but definitely overpriced. You're better off going to Curry Corner, Nandini or Udupi Cafe for similar quality but fairer prices.   The service is a hit-or-miss. I've only had one server be courteous and vigilant in taking orders, filling water glasses, etc. The other 3 times I've visited the servers were negligent and not friendly.   Last straw for me was ordering from there on Uber Eats. We got a tandoori khazana dinner platter, which we wrongly assumed would include rice and bread for the crazy price of $20. Not only was there no rice or bread, but the portion was unbelievably small. TOTAL rip-off.   I suggest taking your business elsewhere that will give you bigger quantities of food for a much more reasonable price."}
{"text":"First let me start off by saying. \"Where the hell have I been?\"  This place is fantastic. One of the best Indian restaurants I have ever been too. Food and service are amazing."}
{"text":"Indian spices are the bomb(bay) in exotic cooking and the food prepared at this Dhaba delivers climatic ecstasy in every bite. Maybe that's why we are taught to place a napkin on our lap. (Just kidding). But seriously folks, this is a hidden gem of a restaurant and the atmosphere, once we were seated, was warm and inviting. For some reason, the hostess pushes reservations and if you don't have one, you will be told to take a seat and could wait up to 20 minutes, even when tables are open. But don't worry, you'll be seated soon enough and it will have been worth the wait. Service was excellent. Ambiance felt authentic (Never been to a roadside restaurant in India). Try their version of lemonade, delicious. Take your time to peruse the menu and savor every bite. Enjoy."}
{"text":"We went here on our \"first time for everything date\" The food was good. But the reason I won't say to myself, hey let's go to the Dhaba is the price. For what it is, it is expensive. Not high end expensive but the dishes are practically rice, sauce, and some sort of meat (or vegetable if you're into the vegetarian side. I liked the food I really did. But $16 for rice, sauce, and 4 tiny dumplings, I would have been happy with 6 but by the time I finished the dumplings I had a ton of rice and sauce left over. I'm not typically one to complain about prices because I like nice restaurants but I don't like feeling like i didn't get what I paid for."}
{"text":"The owner sent me a message and wanted to see if there was anything he can do.  Glad to hear from him.  Also, this review was from quite some time ago.  I updated with 3 stars because the owner really seems to care about this place.  Thanks."}
{"text":"The Dhaba is, IMO, the best place for indian food in phoenix. There are a few others who can make a decent curry, but very few who treat their meat dishes with the same care that's shown at The Dhaba. Where other comparable restaurants might have good vegetarian dishes but falter on dry chicken, The Dhaba excels with proteins. The end result is an experience that's intoxicating in its colors, smells, and tastes, and it will leave you full and happy.  SOME NOTES ON ORDERING:  1.)The Dhaba has a big menu with a lot of names on it that might be intimidating for a new customer or for someone that is entirely uninitiated with Indian (or anglicized Indian) food. Don't be intimidated: if you admit that you're new/clueless, staff will be happy to help.   2.) the dishes (as ordered) are a bit unbalanced and a bit pricey. When you order an \"entree,\" you get a bowl of curry and rice. The curry is the focal point of the meal, but truthfully, the curry is extremely rich and is as much food for 2-3 meals, provided that it's being accompanied by naan and rice. So, if you're having an entree with naan: maybe skip an appetizer. Samosas are fine, but they're also quite filling, and you might regret filling up on papadum and fried dumplings once you realize how misleadingly large the entree is.   3.) Variety is best achieved if you go with a group. It's hard to justify the expense and gluttony of getting palak paneer, chicken tikka masala, *and* lamb korma if you're just going with 1-2 people. But the more people who go, the more people can safely order whatever they want and still come away with lots of variety while still seeming sane portion-wise.  4.) Leftovers are amazing. Don't pick the meat out and leave the curry. The curry is the whole point. Take some home with you and have it on rice/naan the following day. Garlic naan in a toaster oven will make your house smell amazing. And the smell of the curry is so pleasant that it's a sin to not enjoy it twice. So, when considering the price of the entrees: remember that you're buying yourself lunch for the following day also.  5.) Most of the food items have wine suggestions next to them. I have no idea how helpful they are, but I will say that if you ask for an \"indian beer\" they will bring you something that is essentially malt liquor. That might not sound impressive, but the sweetness of it actually goes really well with many spicy dishes and is highly recommended.   Despite the fact that I feel that there is a \"correct\" way to order at the dhaba, and there's maybe ways to have a less satisfying experience, my rating is entirely for the helpfulness of the staff and the very high food quality."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm....If you are looking for a tantalizing taste explosion, go dine in this quaint, Zen-like, ethnic hidden gem. *Absolutely Delicious* (super extensive menu, great vegetarian options) go hungry & share a few platters. Soooooo Bomb(definitely in a food coma now) Yum*"}
{"text":"As an Indian, five stars was out of reach anyway. The food was decent..not bad for Arizona Indian food. We enjoyed the paneer makhni, lamb vindaloo and chicken curry. The naan was also very nice. I tried some chaat (street food in India that is typically flavorful and delicious) and it was border-line inedible..we requested extra spicy and it was bland and likely had been sitting for a while. I never understand why chaat is so difficult to find in Phoenix and this was pretty disappointing. I would also say that it was expensive; a decent Indian buffet is often a better value and larger food coma!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here again just the other day. Whenever I get a craving for Indian food, I come here! Their kashmiri chicken tikka masala is definitely my favorite dish on the menu and their naan is always to die for. Their staff is so, so friendly and I always enjoy their customer service. Absolutely my favorite restraurant right now! I wish I could afford to eat here more! (It's not that expensive, I'm just broke.)"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Indian restaurant in the Phoenix area.  I made a reservation online and they had a table all set with some pappadam and sauces and waters.  Never had such great service like that before!  The serverware in general were very exotic and noticeably increased my enjoyment of dinner.  We got the chicken tikka masala and a lamb dish (just ask for their most popular one, it had tomato based sauce).  The meats were very tender, not overly dry and the sauces were perfect.  They weren't overly skimpy on the meat like some other places too.  The garlic naan was great with the entrees.  The prices are a bit high so I would recommend getting a Groupon if available.  Lunch isn't so bad for pricing but I'm not sure about their portion size."}
{"text":"Can't say that I have dined at every Indian Restaurant in the Phoenix Metro area but I sure have dined at many... Yes, it's true I LOVE me some good Indian food.  We'll anyway, the point I was making (yes, the point!) is that so far, The Dhaba is the best of the best.  Perhaps the most expensive too but like they say, you commonly get what you pay for.   4 stars not 5 because I have been to London and the Indian food there is just off the chain!  If this was rated in comparison to all of London the folks at The Dhaba would not be happy with me as there would be one less star.  However, in all fairness... Best of Phoenix!  Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"The Dhaba is my favorite Indian restaurant in the Valley. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the service can be a bit slow at times.  I love the decor and the ambiance. It's a small restaurant but it's beautifully decorated. It's much nicer in the inside than it looks on the outside.  I read quite a few people complain about the prices. I've always thought their prices were a tad bit high, until this last visit, when I noticed on the dinner menu 3 \"full meal experience\" choices. I got the vegetarian version for $12. It came with a salad (delicious!), a generous helping of naan (their naan is incredible!), daal (lentil stew), rice, yogurt, and the main course, which was a garbanzo bean dish. The final course was rice pudding and chai tea. I was full and happy for $12! My boyfriend got the lamb and chicken option, which was $17, but still a good deal for the amount of food he got. We both thoroughly enjoyed the \"full meal experience\" and would order them again.   They also have a new rewards card for repeat customers, which is great."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Indian food that I have had.  The staff is so friendly.  The food is amazing.  You must have their rasmali for desert.  Trust me!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The whole dining experience was beyond  my expectations.  It is a perfect place for a special occasion. The market next to it was filled with products from India. My daughter and I had such a great time together exploring many different items. I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"This was another Groupon find of mine, although I had heard about it (in a not so good light) from a friend. However, I do love me some Indian food, so I grabbed my partner and headed over there.  The Groupon was for $40, and at most places, if get get apps, food, dessert and iced tea, we hit that mark. Not here. We each order the fanciest Thali they had (comes with salad, naan, biranyi rice, desser, chai, mini mango lassis, dal and two veggie dishes), but they were only $15 a piece, so we wound up ordering two more starters (the potato pancake Chaat and fried Paneer) in order to hit our price point. And then we took a LOT of food home.  The mango lassis were delicious, as was the salad.  I wasn't such a fan of the chaat - it was a little too spicy and a little too mushy. I loved the fried Paneer, but who doesn't love fried cheese? It was great with the tamarind chutney.  As far as the main meal, I loved everything (though next time, will go with plain basmati rice). I especially enjoyed the paneer tikka masala and the malai kofta, my favorite dish ever. The dal was good -- I've never seen kidney beans in it before, but I liked it. The only thing I didn't absolutely love was the Saag Paneer - the texture was too smooth. However, my partner scarfed it down.  For dessert, I was expecting rice pudding, or the sweet balls. Instead, our awesome server asked if we'd tried carrot fudge. We hadn't, so she brought that out.  I liked it, except for the sultana raisins (I hate raisins). It didn't hit the spot for my partner though, and the chai wasn't as strongly spiced as I like (plus I prefer honey to sugar packets as far as sweetening it).  We'll be back, for sure. I might go with a small thali, but it's a really good deal, and an excellent amount of good food for the value. Glad I found it!"}
{"text":"I finally found a lovely Indian place in the Phoenix area. The staff was extremely pleasant and the food. Excellent. Generous portions. I don't plan on going anywhere else for my Indian fix. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have been searching for a good Indian restaurant and I definitely think I've found it! I was so overwhelmed with all of the choices that I decided to get the Maharaja Patiala Tandoori Thali so I could try a little bit of a variety of dishes. A word of warning to those of you who think you like spice: this food is very spicy!  I asked the server to bring down the heat level to 50% and my nose was still dripping, but that didn't take away from the phenomenal taste of the food. I recommend to those of you who are looking for a tasty meal, go to The Dhaba!"}
{"text":"Once we got to the parking lot the Owner greeted us, and asked if we were heading to the restaurant, we answered \"yes\" and followed him. Once we entered the owner entered the restaurant kitchen disappeared, we were following him inside of the restaurant while the owner's wife started to yell at us telling we should wait and that the table was not ready for us... I was like really? The place was empty! The tables were setup already, I don't know what kind of preparation was \"needed\" if you visit you will find she is an Asian lady very grumpy and impatient that doesn't know how to take care of the business. Disappointed. Now the food the Shrimp Curry had barely 2 shrimps. The Portions were very small and very Expensive. I don't understand why this place has so many outstanding reviews, the food was not so good neither, and I have been in many Indian restaurants all over the Valley, so I think I can compare and say it doesn't worth to come back here."}
{"text":"I went here last night with a party of 4.  The place was pretty busy for 7pm on a Wednesday night so luckily I made a reservation and we were seated promptly.  The service was very friendly and helpful but pretty unattentive.  This was probably because there were way to many tables with way too many people and not enough waiters/waitresses/servers.  There were only 3 people  plus the cook(s) doing everything and they were clearly overwhelmed.  The other thing I didn't like was the menu.  It had far too many choices.  There were probably 200+ dishes on the thing.  So we basically gave up and everyone ordered a different kind of dish so we could all share.  We ended up getting a chicken dish, a shrimp dish, a vegetarian dish, and some sort of meat sampler thing.  We also ordered an appetizer sampler thing, some rice and some naan.  Everything was very good and full of unique flavors.  I've never been to India and have only eaten Indian food 3 other times, but I thought the food here was very good.  The only problem with it was the price.  It was ridiculously priced for what you get.  The actual portion size is actually pretty good, but charging $15 for 5 shrimp or 5 pieces of lamb is ridiculous.  It is even more ridiculous because nothing comes with sides.  Everything is a la carte.  My wife got some kind of meat sampler (which came out a full 10 minutes before the rest of our meals) and it was laughable that it was $20.   Anyway, this place pretty much robs you.  Luckily we had a certificate from Local Dines - http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ - which lessened the blow a bit but I was still pissed.  So, if you must go, get the certificate and you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Wow what a find! This place is fantastic! Highly recommend making a reservation because even on weeknights they're packed from 6pm onwards, so you might have a wait if you don't, but either way it's well worth it! If you're looking for a lot of delicious, authentic cuisine, beautiful decor, courteous service, look no further!  We ordered the Tokri Chaat as an appetizer, amazing. It's a medley of the street treats topped with yogurt in a bread basket! I might get this as an entree next time it was so good! Shared among 4 people though as a starter it was the perfect amount. We got garlic and jalepeno naan for the table, both excellent, and the owner is knowledgeable about his wines to pair with each entree.  The entree menu is extensive and a little overwhelming, but all 4 orders came out perfect. There was some overcooked tandoori chicken but that was immediately rectified without any protest. I would highly recommend a Dhaba Thali.  Just make sure you are humble when selecting the level of spiciness ;)"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I ordered way too much food, and the portions are huge! Low the tikka/garlic naan/cauliflower that was spicy! Also loved the owners, so sweet."}
{"text":"After searching for decent Indian food in the Phoenix area I was introduced to The Dhaba a few years ago and it restored my faith that good Indian cuisine could actually be prepared in the valley.  I stick to the vegetarian dishes and have yet to be disappointed.  The staff is always friendly, the restaurant clean and the music fun.  Once in a while there will be videos playing on the flat screen above the bar, but normally just some good music.  I will update this review after eating there this weekend!"}
{"text":"Dhabas are found in India and Pakistan as roadside restaurants or 'truck stalls' serving local foods to truck drivers from the tandoori or 'clay ovens'. They generally have cots for sitting and enjoying the foods of this land. Punjabi food is a diversity of Afghanistan, Persia and Central Asia. Here at The Dhaba you will find authentic, robust, rich Punjabi food like no other I have tasted before in the valley. FINALLY this week, I was able to get my family into The Dhaba for something different!   First off, I will give you this tip: make a reservation. WE did and had no issues, we were sat at a perfectly cute table immediately upon our arrival; but many people that showed up after us waited upwards of 40 plus minutes. This place was packed until about 800pm. We also watched people that walked in get turned away with still forty or so minutes to closing and tables that were open. We made a mental note of that too! MAKE a reservation and make it not near closing if your a linger eater like we are!   The menu is very expansive. Lots and lots of Indian dishes! Some I had heard of before and some were brand new to me and I love that! Since I had not had this type of food in years, and my family maybe never, it was going to take awhile to get through this menu! One thing I liked is that there were three options of meals that came with salad, naan, dessert and a sampling of main options and range from $15-21. We started with the complimentary crisp papadums that are brought to the table with various chutneys ranging in spice from sweet to hot hot. We ended up ordering various starters and a couple of entrees to sample around the table and everything was outstanding! Samosa Chaat; Jantar Mantar, (various naan breads).. THIS is a large serving!;  a fritter like 'street treat', called Pakora; the Shehenghahi Palak Kofta, which is a vegetarian dish that is sort of like cheese type dumplings swimming in a thick curried spicy sauce. This dish had amazing flavor, BUT watch the spice level you choose or you will be clearing your sinuses for days! We also shared the Khazani Tandoori Platter, various meats including shrimp cooked in a tandoori. This was a lot of food for us and we brought a lot of it home; never a bad thing!   The Dhaba is authentic in decor and seemingly to be a family that runs it. It did take us awhile to peruse the expansive menu, as these are foods we are not familiar with and I did feel that to a small degree that we were being a little rushed to make a decision when we kept getting the waitress coming back and then the lady that appeared to be an owner, as well. I find that a tad annoying when out for dinner with my family, as we view dinner to be a social and conversational time and we do like to discuss the food. Hello, we are foodies!   All in all, I loved everything about The Dhaba from the rik rik outside, that my daughter had to snap pics of for her instagram to the decor to the plates on the table and of course, the menu. For me this is the best Indian cuisine I've had in the valley and we can't wait to come back.. BUT again, with a reservation and a bigger appetite!"}
{"text":"This is my Wife and my new favorite Indian place to order off the menu!! To be fair, we have a favorite lunch buffet and a favorite dinner buffet places when it comes to Indian.  Typical Indian service...just enough service and only when needed. They don't hover or push you out the door.  We had the Keema Samosa's and Paneer appetizers. I had the Khanaza Tandoori platter and she had the Chicken Tikka Masala. Everything was delicious and above par for PHX Indian food.  Try the Kashmiri Naan with a spicy vindaloo!!"}
{"text":"Wow...this place is incredible and it seems authentic.  The Dhaba isn't much to look at from the outside, but the restaurant is really nice once you get inside.  The food is served on beautiful plates with very nice silverware.  The service is professional, efficient and helpful with recommendations.  I enjoyed my standard Indian meal that I love and crave - a mango lassi, chicken tikka masala and garlic naan.  The food was incredible and had just the right spice to it.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite dish was the lamb curry. It was very tasty with good herb and spice flavors, although it was more savory and less spicy than other curries that I'm used to. It came with plentiful, huge chunks of lamb. I would get this dish again and it was large enough for two, especially if you add some naan bread to your meal. We had the plain naan. It was very fresh, crispy, and flavorful. I definitely recommend it.  The other dish we tried was the sizzling meat platter. The sausage was spiced nicely with lots of cumin. The red chicken and kabob chicken was likewise flavored nicely. Again, the dishes came with a lot of quality meat, so you will get lots of great bites without any filler ingredients.  To drink, I had the Indian lemonade, which is not at all like fresh or artificial lemonade made in the U.S. It was a very unique drink based on a blend of spices, juice, and water. It was more of a herbal drink. I liked it.  The food was a bit pricey, but had excellent flavors. Fortunately, the meals were quite large and could be split by two people in order to save money. You can also look for Groupon or similar coupons online, although they may choose not to take them, so I recommend calling ahead or getting a legally binding contact first. The service was a bit slow, because only one person was working both the hostess table and serving. The decor is very nice and clearly designed to with a classy Indian style. This style flows through the whole restaurant, from the walls to the tables to the settings."}
{"text":"As usual, the best places are hiding in drab strip malls!  Do not be deceived by the plain outside.  Inside is just delightful!  Really liked the attention to detail with the metal cups and plates and cutlery.  Felt very pulled together.  Excellent Service, friendly and prompt.  Food was all enjoyable.  Saffron Rice is light and supports all the interesting sauces. They spice it exactly as you would hope when using a 1-10 scale.  \"7\" literally had my scalp tingling and my ears burning a little bit - The Best!!  Gosht Rogan Josh (goat) was tender and flavorful. Numberdar Saag Murgh (chicken) allowed us to have chicken and spinach all in one!  the Garlic Naan and Raitha were wonderful accompaniments and we thought the Bhartha (eggplant dish) was the best we have ever had for flavor and texture."}
{"text":"Me and my wife just tried this place as the reviews were really good and the items on the menu looked delicious. Really loved the Goat Biryani and the Chicken tikka masala, really good flavors, to be honest, i think it is one of the best Biryani I have had in Phoenix. Service was so so, could be better, but I would definitely go back to this place."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the Valley as far as I'm concerned. The service has always been beyond terrific and the food is awesome. I really can't say anything bad about The Dhaba.  (Well, once the rice was overcooked, but it was just once.)  It's also a great place for families...they always treat our daughter like a grandkid when we're there."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food around. I've been here several times and have been very happy with it. My last star didn't make it because my last visit had the most horrible service ever! She didn't smile at us, she talked back to us. She rushed us to order which is weird considering the large overwhelming menu they have all with foreign names on it. This was the only thing unpleasant. The hostess was very nice. It was only the one lady that's really ruined the experience. I highly recommend anyone interested in Indian food to try this place out though."}
{"text":"The Dhaba IS the best Indian restaurant in Phoenix.  Located near ASU, it's in a good location.  You would expect to find a lot of students there given the location but I haven't found that to be the case.  But, I usually go for dinner- maybe it's different at lunchtime?    The ambience is very relaxed but trendy/upscale compared with most Indian restaurants.  The owner is extremely gracious and the service is excellent.  The food is absolutely delicious!  Really, the best in town.  Their lamb, usually a good test of the chef's skill, is perfect... juicy, flavorful, very tender.  It practically melts in your mouth.  Everything I've eaten here has been excellent and I'm an adventurous diner who tries many different dishes.  The prices are very reasonable and they frequently send coupons if you sign up for their email list.  I strongly recommend making a reservation in the evenings, especially on Friday and Saturday because, otherwise, you may not be able to get a table!"}
{"text":"Went here for the 1st time lately, but always wanted to try it. I had made a reservation for a birthday and they had a large table already set up with beverages when we arrived. The Chai was excellent, the water was served in copper tumblers and ice cold. The appetizers and food was traditional and and it was delicious and you could choose the heat from 1 to 10. My husband chose 8 and tears streamed down his face, he enjoyed it completely. So many choices of Naan and the menu is extensive with great explanations of each dish. The staff was friendly and authentic and brought a yummy dessert for everyone."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the Valley! Everything is delicious, great service too! Also, Don't get just one Garlic naan.. always 2!"}
{"text":"A little pricey but great food.   Bonus point for the white guy playing the sitar in an otherwise totally Indian staff."}
{"text":"My GF loves Indian food, me well not so much as it always seems to upset my stomach...guess I'm not accustomed to all the spices that are used in Indian food. Maybe that was TMI?? Moving on...having just moved to Tempe I wanted to take my gf somewhere to eat and since she loves Indian food I did a search on Yelp.   The Dhaba appeared to be a top Indian spot according to yelpers. I had seen it days before driving by it as it is hard to miss. It hardly looks like a place that would serve Indian food and rather more resembles some quirky old time western place from the outside. I questioned whether it would be good based on this alone. Surprisingly the whole plaza is \"Indian\" in some way. Indian market, Indian restaurant, and an Indian cafe. Wow! I probably would not have come here if it weren't for the exceptional reviews.  Once you walk into the Dhaba, the restaurant is quaint and beautifully decorated. It was busy, yet the atmosphere was quiet. The hostess was attentive and the service was great.   The food was wonderful. Like I said, I'm not a huge fan of Indian food, but I ordered the Chicken Tikka and I loved it. The portions were big, so unless you have a large appetite you'll most likely have leftovers.   The food was a little pricey, but it was worth it. I look forward to going back again..."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I wasn't terribly hungry actually and ended up just ordering a platter of chicken tikka which came sizzling to the table. It was white meat which I prefer, many Indian restaurants put the word boneless on the menu which leads me to believe chicken breast but it is usually dark meat, off the bone. The Dhaba didn't do that and actually did white meat for chicken tikka which is authentic. The chicken was juicy but needed more flavor. The second time I came here we ordered the chicken achari, malai kofta and garlic naan. The achari was tasty, but I wish the spices were not so coarse, still not bad! The koftas in the malai kofta were good but the gravy had too much jeera (cumin) for me personally, although my fiance liked it. The naan could have been fresher. The third time we ordered their tandoori sampler platter and it was ok, the chicken tikka was my favorite, my fiancé liked the murgh seekh kebabs but the tandoori chicken and tandoori prawns weren't very flavorful and needed more spice. The staff aren't terribly friendly either, and the prices are a little high for the food."}
{"text":"We have been served stale dish 'daal'. It was atleast a day or two old and it was smelling bad. I had expected a better food considering their reviews.  Food was overpriced as well considering the ambience."}
{"text":"a guy at work told me about this place so i decided to phone in an order from my car after work i tmust say it took me 3 times to get somebody on the line, i think they may own the store next door and thats who was answering the phone in a heavy indian accent after my 3rd attempt i finally got a employ/family member im guessing the daughter who spoke clear english i told her ihad not been there before and did not have a menu but between my semi knowledg te of indian food and a few  sugestions from her i got some great dishes spinich dish w/chicken a spicy curry lamb dish and a great vegi dish rice and naan yummmmy"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! Just had lunch here with a friend and the lunch specials are really great! Two people for less than $25: a starter salad for two, an entree each, a small side and dessert. The food was delicious! The tikka masala was excellent and the service was good. It's attached to an Indian market and Indian boutique, which are also interesting. It's cool exposure to a new culture. I have no complaints at all! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place and plan to go back as soon as possible. I don't have anything negative to say about our dining experience. Sure, the outside of the restaurant looks a little cheesy, but the restaurant itself is darling. They make incredible lamb somosas and a rich and very flavorful lamb korma. The lamb was tender and delicious. I ordered garlic naan and my partner ordered something similar to naan, but there were cooked red onions throughout. I can't remember the name of it, but let me tell you, it was fantastic. I personally don't think the neighborhood is that bad, and i've been in bad neighborhoods. No, I wouldn't go for a midnight stroll around there, but for lunch, it's safe. One of the reviewers said, \"Great for Americans\"... Well tell that to the Pakistani family who came in and ordered a bunch of food. Our portions were big, we couldn't eat it all. As for the heat, they ask you how hot YOU want it."}
{"text":"The best Punjabi I have ever had. Had the lamb Vindaloo on an 8/10 spicy scale. Every bite was fiery heaven. Paired it with a Indian lager and sweeter naan bread. 10/10! Will go again."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the quality of the lunch dishes we ordered both me and my husband. So far, I have tried three different Indian restaurants in the valley and this is the best of all three. Although the lunch portion looks small, it was pretty filling. I just wish they had only a little bit more rice and the naan was cooked through completely cause I had some bites that were quite doughy. Lunch prices are very good but a la carte would be slightly more expensive especially if you order appetizers and drinks. Overall the lunch experience was very good and ended with a rice pudding (included) which was delicious. Will be going there again."}
{"text":"I really liked the hara Bhara kabab. It's tasty. The chicken biryani I ordered came exactly like how I wanted. It was spicy and delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is great but its a little pricey for a poor college student like me. The food is really awesome though so I suppose it's worth it. It's also a great place for a nice little romantic date. Out of all the Indian restaurants I've been to in the valley this one has the nicest atmosphere. I especially like to browse the little Indian market next door when I've finished eating."}
{"text":"The best word to sum up my experience would be \"IMPRESSED\". Upon walking in, the decor is beautiful, I love the authentic looking place settings, and the lighting  just gave an all around warm feel to this small space. And even though the restaurant is very small I didn't feel like they had the tables packed in there, so we were all sitting on top of one another or stuck listening to anyone's conversation. Our server was very nice and informative, and was really helpful when selecting the perfect variety of dishes. When our food arrived it was amazingly flavorful and portion size was more than enough for leftovers. Which were just as delicious the next day."}
{"text":"Yelp Eats 2011!  India and Pakistani relations in harmony at The Dhaba.    First off we ordered refreshing Coconut juice with mint.  I love that there are bits and pieces of coconut flesh.  We got 2 huge samosas for our appetizer.  It's filled with curried potatoes and peas and came with a condiment of garbanzo beans.  \"It's spicy!!!\", darn, I didn't even think to ask  the level of heat in those suckers.  So, be warned if your kiddos are sensitive to chili heat.  He enjoyed the garlic naan bread he dipped in a sweet and tangy tamarind sauce.  My hubby luvvy the Chicken Tikka Massala served with saffron rice.  I chose the creamy Spinach Paneer.  So good!  They all came in a copper and stainless steel vessel.  The drinks are also served in the same ware.  If you want, you can buy these at the grocery store next door.  The owner saw that my son didn't eat his food offered him mango juice.  Just for that, this place is on top of my list.  The rest of the service was wonderful.  One of the best Indian resturants we've been to.  We can't wait to try their tandoori dishes on our next visit!"}
{"text":"I never had Indian food this unique. The first thing that I noticed was the good smell of Indian curry and the overall atmosphere featuring many Indian decorations. Everything from the bronze plates, spoons, heavy metal water cups, baskets, added onto the experience. My friend who is from an Indian family actually said that the restaurant served good authentic food, so I'll take her word for it.  My friends and I went as a large group, and was attended and helped frequently. The lunch came with a complementary appetizer with different sauces and something that resembled crackers (refer to picture), and we ordered an additional garlic naan. When we were about to order, there were an overwhelming amounts of different kinds of curry - I appreciated the choices, but it was somewhat hard to decide because I wanted to try it all. People can request for different spice levels - I wouldn't recommend going too high though because the food can be very spicy. I'm awful at eating spicy foods so I ordered the no-spice-at-all curry, which was still great. I had the chicken curry, and my friend had the one with cheese chunks inside. I know that sounds weird, but I think I actually liked her curry better than mine.   Along with our curry, we got large platters of rice with hints of different spices. I wish I could explain it better, but the taste was something that I haven't personally experienced before. Take my word for it though - the food at this place was good.   I will go back to The Dhaba again for sure because I found out that I really do love authentic Indian food, and I'd give more than 5 stars if I could. With amazing setups, great food, kind service, I'll be sure to bring my sister over for a meal!"}
{"text":"We went on a weekday afternoon at around 1230pm. It was fairly empty.  The food was A-mazing. We had different tikka masalas with basmati rice. Perfect rendering. I tried the gluten-free, vegan roti, and it was yummy, especially with the plum sauce we got with the gulshan e bazar, which were also gluten-free, vegan, and delicious.   As someone who can't eat gluten or eggs (and shouldn't eat dairy either, really), I was amazed that I could have a satisfying, allergen-free meal that was super delicious.   and the service was very friendly and very, very helpful. It's a huge plus that their menus are marked for GF, Veg, Vegan (though dairy and eggs separated would be nice)!"}
{"text":"I loved this place when I first reviewed it years ago, and I somehow love it even more now. The service is consistently pretty good, and the food the best Indian food I've had in Phoenix. The menu remains extensive and caters to a variety of tastes, preferences, and diets, so this place is a pretty great option for anyone who isn't averse to Indian food.  The prices remain high, but fair. The Dhaba does however frequently offers discount coupons on Groupon and similar websites, in addition to participating in reward programs for Delta, Opentable, and the like. Be sure to take advantage of these offers, and you'll rack up plenty of discounts, free food, and assorted benefits in addition to the soul-affirming deliciousness that I love this place for.  You should really stop reading and make a reservation. Like, now.   (That is, unless you're reading this at 1 AM for some reason, in which case you need to go to bed already.)"}
{"text":"The food in general was pretty decent. Although the tandori chicken was a bit on the dry side. The restaurant is quite small and doesn't have much of an ambiance. I wouldn't bring a date here."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding.  Had the Chicken Curry with Naan Bread.  The only thing that ruined it was the obnoxious brat sitting across from me which I finally had to ask him myself to be quiet because I was trying to enjoy my meal.  Mom was a bit pissed with an evil eye.  My thoughts are, if you can't control your kid, then stay home!  Or at the very least, have some common courtesy and common sense to extricate your child from the scene."}
{"text":"I was so pleased with my evening at The Dhaba. Their food was really good, their ambience was so much better than a lot of mom-and-pops and the neighboring shops are just charming. The grocery store next door had so many interesting foods and condiments. One thing that struck me was that no matter which box of prepackaged meals I picked up, the ingredient list was all of real food and spices... No ingredients you couldn't pronounce. What a novel idea... I'm excited to bring my Indian friend here. She and I have eaten at many Indian places around the valley and I really think she'll love this place. For dinner, I had the Ambala Tiki Chaat as an appetizer... wonderful! And Tikki Masala. As good as many I've had. And Lahori Malai Kofta which is a vegetarian substitute for meatballs. It consists of dumplings made out of paneer (cottage-cheese), cauliflower florets, carrots and potatoes in a rich and creamy sauce. I'd never had it before, but recommend it highly! I'll be back to The Dhaba again very soon!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Dhaba a couple of times and I have never been impressed by their food. I am very particular about Indian food because I am Indian. I was forced to visit Dhaba again because everyone in the group wanted to. They have really improved the quality of the food. I definitely recommend their paneer tikka masala and Chilli naan. The naan is not too spicy and perfect for the curries."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service, butter chicken and chicken tikka masala are a must especially if you area first timer and have never ate Indian food. The food can be suprisingly spicy if you aren't careful so if you ask for a 7 or 8 your asking for some spicy stuff if your usually a mild kind of person. Overall best Indian food in Arizona by far!!!!"}
{"text":"To me, Indian food is like art: I'm no expert, but I know what I like. And I like The Dhaba!   Served \"Punjabi\" style, the dishes are exceptionally flavorful. A talk with the owner afterwards revealed that he insists on strictly fresh ingredients, down to the daily-ground spices. Well, it certainly shows! Moreover, the service was exceptionally polite and attentive.   We've only been here once (so far) but can highly recommend the Chicken Murgh Seekh Kabob & the Shrimp Jhinga Tandori.  Just Beware: the dishes & prices can add up fast. Even so, well worth it!  We rarely hand out 5 stars, but feel The Dhaba fully deserves it!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I have ever had.  From the chutney to the chicken tikka To the rice pudding.  The staff is very friendly and the market next door has a lot of unique and interesting items."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved The Dhaba.  From the moment we walked in, we knew we were in for a treat.  It's a quaint little restaurant in the Indian Plaza, and the place settings were what really caught my attention.  Now here's a little breakdown of my rating:  - Service.  Extremely friendly, family oriented and always knew when to come to the table.  Drinks were refilled accordingly, and the owner is so darn nice.  She gave great suggestions and even brought out a surprise dessert for my fiance's birthday.    - Food.  We ordered:  Udta Panchi - chicken wings marinated in Dhaba spices and baked in a clay oven.  Absolutely delicious and extremely moist!    Garlic and Khasta Keema Naan (minced lamb stuffed naan).  The textures were wonderful.  Lightly crispy on the outside and delectably soft and chewy on the inside.  The chutneys were delicious as well.  Chicken Tikka Masala - of course a signature dish of most Indian restaurants.  It was flavorful and had great body.  Smothered this on rice and scooped it up with the naans, and you've got yourself one killer meal!  Sikandri Jhinga Saag (shrimp and spinach with herbs and spices - almost like an Indian creamed spinach - just no cream) - light and flavorful and accompanied the other dishes quite well.  Great with the naan and a little bit of chutney.  The only reason I wouldn't rate this restaurant 5 stars is because I would actually like to experience the consistency of their service and food quality.  There are many fantastic Indian restaurants I've been to, and although I loved Dhaba - it still comes in a close second to another Indian restaurant that I enjoy going to out here in Vegas.    But I'll tell you what - Dhaba was unforgettable. My fiance and I still talk about our meal, so maybe they do deserve that extra star.  ;)"}
{"text":"I travel this country for a living and this is my favorite Indian restaurant. The owners are wonderful and welcoming. The food.... Don't even get me started!"}
{"text":"About food : Food was ok but I like hara bhara kabab.  Service: Good but too slow ..it look like only one lady is working.  Dislike: -  We order Mango lassi but it was taste stale and they made it long back...(we asked  to replace with salt lassi and they replaced it..)  - as well as we get bell paper with COOK sticker (sticker place by farmers) .. it seems they wan't care about quality :("}
{"text":"I come here a lot. The food is excellent! If your a fan of Indian food this is a must try in my opinion. I am working my way through the menu but the Chicken Tikka Masala will always be my favorite and dont forget a Garlic Naan its delicious!  The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the spotty service. Depending on the night there may only be one waitress in the dining room and this place is usually busy so make sure you make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Best Indian we've had in the Valley! The Paneer Tikka Masala was delicious, as was the Saag. We ordered \"spicy\" and it was just the right amount of hot for us (which is definitely spicy). Will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"I think I heard too much hype...it just wasn't good. Very bland biryani with little or no meat, subpar service, and slow food delivery. I prefer Priya...though the service is not good either...their dishes are delicious."}
{"text":"WOW! I took my husband here for his birthday dinner after seeing this restaurant featured on PBS' \"Check Please, Arizona\". The Dhaba does not disappoint. I come from an Indian family of very picky eaters and cook Indian food myself at home on a regular basis. We started with a couple of chaat plates - pani puri and the samosa plate. Both were excellent. The samosas were the best I had in a very long time. For dinner my husband ordered the Dhaba chicken curry and I ordered a palak kofta curry that was out of this world. I'm not normally a fan of spinach curries, but this one showed me that I had never had a good spinach curry before. The kofta in this curry was dreamy, made out of nuts, carrots, cauliflower and other goodies.  If you've read my other reviews, I don't hand out five star reviews on a regular basis. In fact, I have a very high standard when it comes to quality and flavor. The Dhaba has it all in addition to very warm and attentive servers. The space is intimate, the tables large and comfortable, and the decor comforting, homey and unpretentious. I believe The Dhaba to be absolutely THE  BEST Indian food in the valley. I am so so happy I tried this restaurant and I will keep coming back for more. There are so many different dishes on the menu that I will be coming here for a very long time!  Do yourselves a favor and go to The Dhaba. Word to those who are averse to hot spicy - dishes are ordered on a scale of 1-10 in terms of heat. I ordered a 7 because I love hot spicy food, my husband ordered a 5. Both had a good level of heat to them, and I was sweating after a few minutes! Love it! If you enjoy hot and spicy food, go for it. If you don't, I would definitely stay under 5. When they say spicy they mean it! You won't find watered down flavors here."}
{"text":"I am pretty new to Indian cuisine. I have only had it a few times at parties, or events at work. I have liked most of what I have tried. A few months ago Groupon offered a deal for The Dhaba, and based on a recommendation from a friend I decided to take advantage of the offer. Guess What? I totally forgot  until a day or two before the offer ran out. So, I quickly got a group together and made reservations for Thursday night which was the final night of the offer.   When we arrived it was apparent that I was not the only doofus that waited until the last night. The restaurant was packed, and people were outside waiting. The hostess was actually turning people without  reservation away. I was so glad that I had made a reservation, because we were seated within 5 minutes of arriving. The downside was that we waited over 20 minutes for a server to come to our table.  My group decided to order three appetizers and three main dishes.   Appetizers: * Paneer pakora * Punjabi murgh (chicken) pakora * Punjabi vegetable platter featuring veggie and paneer pakora.  THE WINNER: The Punjabi vegetable platter.  We laughed saying they tasted like Bloomin' Onions only different. The chicken was also very good, but the paneer pakora was a bit bland.  Main Entrees:  * Dhaba chicken korma  * Dhaba lamb curry * Achari lamb.   THE WINNER: Dhaba Chicken korma.  It was so creamy and had a rich nutty flavor. I felt bad. I really didn't want to share.  Both of the lamb dishes were good, but I found them to be excessively salty. The Achari Lamb was way to spicy for my taste.  The service was ok given that they were understaffed and extremely busy, but I will let this slide since I waited until the last night to use the Groupon deal. I will tell you. I am a Dhaba fan, and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Small place, not much spacious. Starters were great. However, the main course (sp. Achari Aaloo) was disappointing."}
{"text":"I tried this because I had a gift certificate.  I ordered the Gosht Rogan Josh with  lamb and a chicken with rice, raisins and nuts dish. Gosht Rogan Josh was spicy.  I only ordered this because I made this dish using a mix from a box bought at Lee Lees but I think the boxed version was much better.   I loved the garlic naan, though.  One couldn't go wrong with this. The chicken dish was aromatic and filling. It was a large portion.  I'd go back to try other dishes, though. Parking is tight."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the best Indian we've had in a while in fact. The flavors were all very independent of each other, the spice levels what I expected, and our server was also pleasant.   My only question is the naan. I've been to many Indian restaurants with naan always being consistent in price, but I'm not sure how or why we got 2 smallish pieces. This was the only flaw I found with this place. I'm confused because in some of these photos there's a stack of 4-6 pieces. Am I missing something, naan perhaps?   Hell, I'm still going back it was really good."}
{"text":"The food here to me is amazing . The hospitality  is a lil standoffish .Overall great experience there and I will continue coming back . Hey this is my third time in less then two weeks .The vegetable curry is to die for !!!"}
{"text":"The food was very good.  Our first time for Punjabi food .  This restaurant is the real deal...  very authentic in every way."}
{"text":"Chicken tikka masala was good. I recommend that dish from Dhaba. But I was expensive. $16 plus tax. That's the only dish I tried.  I moved from Irving, TX. That's where you can find the best indian for cheap. So compared to indian restaurants in Irving, TX Chicken tikka is pretty good."}
{"text":"Terrific Food. Average Service.  The Dhaba clearly has some of the better prepared Indian dishes in probably all of Phoenix / Tempe AZ area. It begins right at the menu where the items are listed in a clever fashion with an intelligent play on words. The touch of an actual Rickshaw at the store entrance was quite interesting.  We had dishes from the tandoor including chicken, fish and lamb. Food was excellent and went even better with a bottle of wine. This establishment clearly has a terrific grasp on the tandoor oven and the accompanying and associated tastes and flavors.  The service on the other hand did not match the excellence of the prepared foods. Service was slow at times and we had to get the attention of the server a few times. Service needs a little bit of professionalism added to it.  We will go back to eat at this establishment again because the food was that great."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have never had a bad experience, whether there were 3 of us or 16.  The food is amazing. The vindaloo will make you cry. The korma is like velvet. The naan is crispy on the outside, pillowy on the inside and melts in your mouth.   But what really makes this place special is the service. The servers treat you like family, and are happy to make recommendations. They are always happy and bend over backwards to make sure your experience is a good one."}
{"text":"This is part of India Plaza.  As you would expect, it is an Indian restaurant.  Punjabi, more specifically.  I had heard good things from Indian folks I know, but it took me a while to come in.  First, don't confuse the cafe next door with The Dhaba.  It's all part of the same plaza, same owner.  But the cafe has a much different menu (much simpler).    The Dhaba is relatively small.  Perhaps 10 tables.  Reservations are a good idea if you want to be sure to get a table without waiting.  The ambiance is simple, understated.  The plates and utensils are rather unique.  Metal plates (with some sort of different metal rim piece).  I'm assuming these are traditional.  The menu is quite extensive.  I didn't really know what most of the items were.  There is vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian.  But no beef, which was not really a surprise.  The samosas were very good.  They were served with a chick-pea dip (or soup?), that was also really good.  We played it \"safe\" and went with vindaloo and tikka masala, and both were excellent also.  My wife did have the mango lasse, and she said it was good but not as good as India Oven.  The rest, however, was better.  The naan bread is not included, you have to order it.  It's good, but I think it should be included as it is in most other Indian restaurants.  Now for the bummer:  the price.  The Dhaba is probably 30% more expensive than the next best Indian restaurant we've found (India Oven).  Maybe 40%.  It was all good, but definitely pricey (despite Yelp's scale being \"moderate\"...at perhaps $20 per person including tip) compared to others in its category.  If you use \"Groupon\" they sometimes have one for The Dhaba, and it really helps.  The one I've seen you pay $20 for $40 of food.  We went over $40, and the final bill (after Groupon) was about what I would expect to pay at India Oven.  Is it worth it?  With a Groupon, Yes!  Without, well, that's up to you.  It is really good Indian food."}
{"text":"Maybe we went here on the wrong night. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing. Either way, it wasn't very good. This was my second trip to The Dhaba. On my previous trip, I don't remember it being terribly bad, but the restaurant didn't particularly stick out in my mind. This trip, we ordered the palak paneer and the chicken tikka masala. The paneer was hard and rubbery, not the normal texture I have had elsewhere. The chicken in the tikka masala was very dry and chewy. We ordered both dishes to be spicy, and they were both somewhat bland. The garlic naan was definitely the highlight of the meal.   The restaurant was noisy, and the table set us far apart, making conversation difficult. The servers were friendly, however we often had to ask for various things. This may have been my last trip to The Dhaba. :("}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix from DC. was hoping to find delicious Indian food like we get in DC. Dhaba definitely delivered. Enjoyed all the dishes. Especially the lamb vindaloo and the palak paneer. So glad we came!!!"}
{"text":"You guys. The tikka masala. The spice. Perfection. Amazing.    Weird bathroom sitch, so close to the sitting area and a urinal, bleck.  But doesnt matter, food trumps any building logistics."}
{"text":"An ok restaurant but very very rude hostess. The food is nice (biryani of course) but the Punjabi Kadhi Pakora was horrible.  Over priced menu."}
{"text":"I'm giving the Dhaba 4 stars, after much thought.   The negatives: the tastinesss of the food is good but unspectacular by Indian restaurant standards. Similarly, the service was also satisfactory, though our non-Indian waiter had kind of an odd personality. Nothing that affected our service I guess, but my friends and I discretely exchanged looks of bewilderment more than once during dinner. On service and food alone, I would give the Dhaba an average or slightly above-average 3 stars.   What brings it over the edge to 4 stars are the little things. Where else in Arizona can someone like one of the friends I was with, a white dude from a small town in rural Utah, have his first taste of a Thums Up or Limca!? Seeing those old-school Indian soda offerings on the menu blew me away. (It also featured Fanta, also popular in India back in the day but with an equally nostalgic effect on my white-bread American friends). The traditional cots in the patio seating area outside (useless trivia: \"cot\" is a Hindi word borrowed by the English), the stainless steel glasses used to serve water and other authentic Indian-dhaba details had a similar effect on me. I was both impressed and swept up by the nostalgia.   Another plus factor is the extensive and creative menu selection. For the unacquainted, I recommend you try as an appetizer one of the \"chaats\", especially the tiki chaat, with a caveat about their high spiciness levels. If you're a culinary adventurer, there are plenty of other things to experiment with. I've always considered one of the bonuses of experimenting with Indian food to be that there are always dozens of vegetarian selections, so the risk of eating something truly nasty without knowing it really is minimal.   I will confess, this business started on the wrong foot with me. I still suspect it engaged in some dubious Yelp marketing practices, early on. And the very name, Dhaba, is also a bit presumptuous in my book. A dhaba is a highway truck stop you will find everywhere throughout northern India and Pakistan. Within these dhabas is the best Indian food you will ever taste in your life anywhere in the world, period. Eating at Tempe's Dhaba is not, I'm afraid, the same thing as eating at a dhaba. Despite all that, their effort at adding some funny and curious details to the dining experience for those who are familiar with India is enough to win my grumpy self over.   Conveniently located within a 2-3 minute stroll from the Apache-McClintock light rail stop."}
{"text":"the chicken massala was good but the portion didnt actually have enoigh chicken...  also thought the menu was confusing  the food tasted very good though"}
{"text":"Now with so many good things going for it, I did leave The Dhaba slightly indifferent. You see when I order and eat, I'm pretty much a total top. While I am open to suggestion, I have a good idea of what I want and how I want it. During my visit, not only was I flipped but I didn't have much say in the matter. Please don't get me wrong, our server was friendly however, every time when one of us ordered something, he would tell us that he would order something better for us to enjoy. For me, I was dead set on ordering several wraps and rolls called Sada Bahar, what I ended up with was far from what I originally envisioned. While I did get my way with a few appetizers, I have to say not only was I pleased with his domineering ordering selections, but would eagerly let him order again for me.  Street food called chaat, is to Indian cooking as dim sum is to Chinese. Usually a small plate with around 3 servings varying in preparation, and with enough variety to make a meal out of. Starting with the Amritsri Samosa Chaat ($6); these are a deep fried triangular dumpling filled with a mixture of potatoes, onions and chili, served with a spicy yogurt sauce. Perfectly crunchy and not a drop of oil, just breaking into one of them was a delight as the fragerent steam escaped, it was aromatherapy Indian style.  Ambala Tiki Chaat ($6) was more of a composed small plate. A couple of potato pancakes, layered with garbanzo beans, onions, and garnished with fresh mint & tamarind chutney and yogurt. The flavor components with Indian cooking are generally very complex, this plate was a great example of complexity and harmony. Each bite had varying degrees of spicy and sweet then a slightly sour finish from the chutney.  Complexity doesn't quite work like with the Kolkata Pani Puri ($6). These are round hollows, fried crisp and served with a watery mixture of tamarind, chili and potatoes. The idea is to spoon in some of the mixture into each puri, then pop into your mouth. While the texture was nice, the flavors just never came together and ended up just tasting weird.  This is the part where he took over and assured us what he was ordering was going to be quite good. As the dishes came out we weren't quite sure what was what, so we just dug in. Eventually we got clarity and just continued to share, family style.  Arriving on a sizzling iron skillet covered with peppers and onions, the Chicken Tikka Kabob ($11) was not only a dramatic presentation coming from the kitchen, but the colors were vivid and bright. Large pieces of boneless/skinless chicken breast are rubbed with spices then grilled, resulting in a beautiful yellow color. The chicken was tender and moist yet had a slight smokiness that added another welcome dimension.  Served in a large basket were piles of hot freshly baked naan ($3 per order). The thick and tender bread was a welcome site since I was wanting a wrap to begin with. Plain, garlic and chili each flavor welcomes dipping, wrapping and scooping of sauces and meats.  Loving yogurt, the creamy tang of the Kashmiri Chicken Tikka Masala ($10) was a welcome surprise. This is where the naan really came into play by making good use of the tender pieces of chicken and yogurt sauce. Sopping up as much of the delicious sauce as I could, interactivity is just part of the experience.  With so many different spices and spiciness, the Mango Lassi ($3) was as welcome as the rain. Yogurt and water mixed with sugar and mango was cooling and refreshing. With the addition of a fruit puree on the inside of the glass, made this version different than others Ive tried, though the effect was still the same.  At the end of the meal we were brought out a bowl of rice pudding with a scoop of pistachio ice cream. While the sliced dates and papaya were pretty to look at, none of the flavors made much sense together. Complaining aside, this did arrive complimentary. Who knows, maybe for being a good sports?  We were also brought out another off menu item, it was a thick, flaky and buttery paratha. Similar to a flour tortilla, this particular version was filled with pureed cherry and sprinkled with anise seeds. After only one taste we were hooked. The group of us made short order of the warm tender layers. You might have to ask for this one to be made special. Our server actually told us how soldiers in the hills of Afghanistan, would make these since it didn't take to many ingredients or tools. He stared blankly out the window as he told the story, perhaps of his own personal experience building make shift clay ovens?  Alright, so sometimes letting go can be a hard thing to do. After this experience, its actually kind of nice sitting back and enjoying the surprises the kitchen has in store."}
{"text":"Excellent food, quick service too. The chai tea was fantastic and the aromas made my stomach grumble with anticipation. Try this little gem. You'll be very glad you did :)"}
{"text":"This has been my go to Indian restaurant ever since I moved to the valley last year(mostly dinners) . The quality has degraded over the last few months and the worst experience was when I went in there on a Sat afternoon with my wife and small son for an early lunch . As always , called ahead of time and made the reservation . The lady who seated us didn't bother to greet us ( because we are Indians and thats a norm here . They don't care about Indians ) . We ordered the food and waited for 15 mins and voila , in came one of the entrees which was super salty and the Phulkas were cold . It took them almost 15 mins to redo the entree and we were almost done with our lunch by then . A forgettable experience . paid over 66$+ for 3 Entree , 3 phulkas and 1 Naan ( worth it ? Not so much )  Pros :  - Authentic Indian cuisine   - Nice cozy place  Cons : - Customer service - $$$$ ( They recently increased the prices ) . - Quality   Lastly , if you don't have a reservation , don't bother going to this place ."}
{"text":"i really liked the food here. i would be kidding myself if i wrote that i remembered what i ordered, but it was vegan.  the menu is enormous and it took us about 10 minutes to get through it. however, the staff never rushed us. in fact, they offered assistance in deciphering what we might best be suited for.  and you know what else is great? they actually play indian music in the background...and have an indian hostess!  for 2 entrees, a mango lassi, an app, a garlic naan....50 bucks. with a coupon...20 bucks. had plenty of leftovers for another meal.  check out the store next door. it has those microwave indian stews that you add rice. these packets are so delicious and quick."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  I just love ethnic food. especially India Food.  My husband and I call it fun food as it is so much fun to eat.  The Dhaba is our favorite restaurant for this cuisine.  I love to get the combo plate so to speak, the one that has several dishes.    I ate here about a month ago besides several other times in the past and have never been disappointed in any way.  Can't wait to go back again.  One more thing;  it is also a beautiful restaurant and the staff are very sweet!"}
{"text":"Just ate here with my boyfriend and I was very impressed. We did not make reservations but it was a Sunday night and I didn't really take the reservation thing seriously. I would imagine that it might get busy on a Friday or Saturday night and require reservations though, because the place is not huge. Not small either, but very cosy.  We both ordered the \"whole meal\" thalis. My boyfriend had the maharaja (all meat) and I had the combo with dal, chick peas, and chicken curry. The biryani that came with the food was the best I have ever had. I would go there just to eat the biryani alone. The naan was top notch too. Everything was delicious. I was really surprised for Arizona.  The thalis also come with chai and desert. They were very accomodating when I forgot that chai is brewed with whole milk (I'm lactose intolerant) and they traded mine out for a delicious dark tea.  The service was a little slow, but still great. The restaurant was almost full while we were there but it was never too noisy. The modern Indian music was a nice touch too."}
{"text":"By far the best Indian food I've had since moving to Arizona.  The Chicken Tikka Masala and Vegetable Korma are my go-to favorites every time.  The only negative about The Dhaba is that it can be somewhat slow in the service department.... it actually adds a bit to the mellow feel of the atmosphere there, but if you're in a rush, it's probably not a good choice.  The food is ALWAYS worth the wait."}
{"text":"Incredible! That pretty much says it. The service and food were spot on. Easily the best Indian food, no, food, that I have ever had. I would say it is the best restaurant I have ever eaten at, including \"high end\" restaurants that are easily two to three times the price."}
{"text":"I am spoiled for Indian food now. This place is the best. It smells awesome and the decor is nice. I've eaten here twice, once for lunch when it was slow and it was very quiet and once on Friday when it was busy and it was a little on the loud side. No matter, I love the food. The Lamb Korma is to die for and the Tikka Masala is awesome. The Kashmiri Naan is so good. I love this place."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow is all I can say.  First of all I love the atmosphere.   Because he has located his restaurant in the midst of his other Indian oriented stores, it has a feeling of attractive authenticity.  The husband is from the Punjab and the wife is from Hong Kong.  They make a marvelous and delightful team.  The food is the real star here.  The Papardams with delicious sauces were the starter.  Then we had their chick pea dish which was so light and flavorful.  Everything was obviously fresh.  I then had the chicken biryani and my wife had a mixed vegetable dish and both were exquisite.  The naan bread was delicious as well.  I have nothing negative to write.   We will become regulars as we have been looking for a good Indian restaurant without any luck in the Scottsdale area.  Try the Shiraz red wine from India.  It goes so well with the spicy food."}
{"text":"Would give this place a higher rating if the service wasn't so spotty.  The food is great, came here for restaurant week and got a great deal, an appetizer, two curries and dessert with two chai's for $30.00  We went ahead and bought two bottles of wine just for fun too.  I've been in here before and there is a very sweet server who makes recommendations and brings out the food.  The weird part was that this time, we barely saw her and instead were basically ignored by all wait staff (two other folks).  We had to ask for the restaurant week menu (which they had hidden), they then proceeded to forget to bring out the chais and hustled us out of there until we reminded them that it was supposed to come with dessert.  Service snafu's aside, the food is really good and hard to argue with.   All the great standards are here and if they pick up a bit on the service (it got to the point that we had all the plates stacked up to make a visual cue, but they still left the plates there as we ate dessert) the restaurant would be a regular outing for me."}
{"text":"I wanted to go and eat at the Curry Corner a few blocks away, but my friend who is a bit of a snob didn't want to eat at the CC, so off we go to The Dhaba.  It's in a nice location, next door is a large Indian market.  The interiors of the Dhaba is very nice with asian-inspired furnishings, mostly dark wood.  It's actually a very intimate place, they serve the drinks/water in a very artistic metal drinking glass.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala, samosa and my favorite, garlic naan.  My friend had mostly vegetarian, the serving size were more than enough for two people.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive.  It's really a must try for those visiting Phoenix/Tempe area and so I give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Been to a few other Indian restaurants and this wins first place still. The food taste amazing, love the free appetizers and even the silverware is adorable. Always get the Gobi aloo and veggie curry. So good!!!"}
{"text":"Let me first thank Yelp Deals for brining this into my life. Let me then thank the abundance of Yelp employees I know who brought Yelp Deals into my life and thus brought The Dhaba into my life. \"The Dhaba,\" just like every item on your menu, I have no idea what you mean. I can only assume it translates into \"super delicious,\" \"super freaken delicious,\" \"slice of god,\" or purely \"pure exctacy.\"   I don't eat Indian food that often, I'm not sure why, but maybe its because I'm a moron. After dining at The Dhaba, I not only want to make Indian food a part of my life, I think I now want to marry an Indian woman, who will cook Indian food for me for the rest of my days on this plante. I will take care of everything else in our lives as long as you make me the standard seven meals a day.  I can't think of anything bad to say about this place. Top of the line food, great service, great decor, and did I mention how much I like the food. I guess the one downfall is that it is in Tempe, which means you have a greater chance of running into ASU types. Besides the repulsion of dining with ASU things, this is a tasty restaurant that I recommend to anyone who is not stunted with the stupid genes."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my birthday dinner here, with family and friends. This was only my second experience with Indian food, but it was amazing. Everything was delicious and the staff was accommodating and friendly. The menu was informative which is a huge plus considering my first time was over two decades ago. I will definitely revisit this little gem and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves Indian or wants to try it for the first time. If you're going during the weekend you may want to make a reservation, as it's a fairly small place."}
{"text":"I'm quite impressed with The Dhaba.  It's a little small restaurant surrounded in what is called the India Plaza in Tempe.  Truthfully, I can't pronounced what we ordered, but it was damn good.  My friend ordered some Marsala that was pretty awesome -- which I can at least say Marsala haha!  Overall the food was a excellent!  Service was okay and quick, however the CC issue kinda got to me when they couldn't charge 2 -- Yes 2 different CC correctly.  Ambience was probably my favorite.  The decors where pretty authentic I gathered and felt like I was transformed to a time -- where all storys start with \"Long Ago\".  Metal plates and water cups, what shall we sacrifice next har har!"}
{"text":"The Dhaba is by far the best Indian restaurant in Phoenix. I love Indian food and I've eaten at a dozen or more restaurants in the Valley... let me tell you, once I tried the Dhaba, I've never gone anywhere else! There's no other restaurant in Phoenix that beats the quality of the food here! Everything on the menu is a masterpiece and I've never walked away hungry or unsatisfied.  You start your meal with a complementary appetizer of papadums (large flat circular chips), served with an assortment of chutneys. My favorite dishes: Lahori Malai Kofta (vegetarian meatballs), Paneer Tikka Masala (cheese cubes in a tomato sauce), and Vegetable Korma (veggies in a creamy, nutty sauce). The best lamb dish I've tried is Kadahi Gosht, lamb in a spicy sauce with sauteed veggies. Your meal comes with a huge serving of rice and don't forget to order garlic naan!  The Dhaba is a small, intimate restaurant. Great for double dates or going out with your family if they're adventurous enough to try curry! I highly recommend making a reservation online. I've never had problems making same-day reservations, but I have been forced to wait 20 minutes as a walk in. (The wait is worth it!) The restaurant is in a small plaza with limited parking, but there's extra parking in the back. Be sure to check out the small Indian grocery and marketplace next door!   Many thanks to the owner Naveen for running such a wonderful establishment! Can't wait to be back for another feast soon!"}
{"text":"Food sucks in this joint. High Prices and slow service. not sure why they are still in business. Do yourself a favor and eat somewhere better !"}
{"text":"delicious, authentic.... but altogether a bit pricey!   the husband and i were glad to find a delicious punjabi restaurant near our new place in tempe; we will obviously be back... however the prices will probably keep us from becoming regulars.   there's an indian-style \"chips and salsa\" type deal they bring out at the beginning with 3 different sauce/dips. one is fire-burning hottttt, one is a green cilantro dip with a little zip, and the other an amazing tamarind sauce. the \"chips\" are crispy sesame flatbread type crackers that are amazing.   as always, chicken tikka masala is a good standby... the rogan josh was also delish here... oh, who am i kidding? it was all good! i loved the ambiance and the authentic dishes the food was served in.   just a pity it's a little pricey."}
{"text":"The Dhaba is the only place I got for Indian food in the Phoenix area. It's so flavorful and they'll make your meal as spicy as you'd like. I don't always know what I'm ordering, but it's always delicious."}
{"text":"Husband and I used a Deal Chicken coupon here to celebrate Father's Day.  We went on the Saturday night before.  I didn't think to make reservations, which was my bad.  I just didn't even think about it.  So when we got there we were told it was going to be a 30 min wait, which turned into an hour.  I was glad that we had given ourselves plenty of time for dinner before the movie we were going to see was to start.  I was pretty laid back about it since I knew I had a coupon.  My husband on the other hand was getting pretty antsy.  I think we were told at least 4 times that it would be another 10 mins , then another 5 mins, and so on.    Once seated it took another 15 mins to have someone take our order.  We were advised that the restaurant was really busy and to be patient.  I was trying to be a good sport since we were celebrating and just went with it.  Once we ordered the food actually came out rather quickly.  The food was excellent, I just wish that they had provided more rice.  We had tried to order 4 orders of Naan.  The woman who took our order told us that we shouldn't do that, that it was too much food.  My husband loves naan and we eat Indian food enough that we know.  So she talked us down to 2.  Wish we had gotten more *sigh*.    The food was delicious and the restaurant was cute and cozy.  But I don't think we will be back.  The wait was too long and we live in central phoenix, so it isn't convenient to where we live."}
{"text":"The good: Awesome food. Or at least very good food. My mango chicken had a bit of a bite to it even though I ordered it mild, but the flavor was good. Hubby loved his food. Our rose lassi was good, but small for the price ($4). The appetizers were all delicious although I don't remember any of the names.  The not so good- somewhat sullen service. We had trouble getting the waitress's attention several different times. She balked at splitting the check between two different parties even after we marked which dishes went onto each tab.  Most irritatingly, they tacked an 18% tip onto each tab even though we only had a party of 5 (4 adults, 1 child). I didn't see anything on the menu about the predetermined tip. Most places that do this only do it for parties over 6, 8 or 10 and it is almost always mentioned on the menu. This was really a major irritation after the mediocre service."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. Every. Single. Time. No matter how busy or hectic they get, they will make sure to give each customer the best service. Thank you guys and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all , I didn't like the taste of the food and I didn't think the service was good at all. I won't be going back here for sure. I also thought it was over priced for what they offered.   I wouldn't recommend this place to my family and friends, but I know alot of people who find it to be fine.. Personally I just didn't like it though.."}
{"text":"I love Indian food and I have tried a lot of Indian restaurants in Arizona, but this place is by far the best.  I've been here for dinner and they also have great lunch specials.  I had the Kashmiri chicken tikka masala with a spicy level of 7.  It was amazing.  Everything is fresh and has a great authentic taste.  I also got salad, garlic naan, basmati rice, lentil soup, and rice pudding.  The host and server were great and the atmosphere was pleasant.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've ever had! So many choices on their menu. The price is a little bit high but the tasty food deserves it."}
{"text":"This is our 1st time dinning at The Dhaba. We loved the ambiance and the decor of the place. The server/hostess was very nice and the food was AMAZING! We had the garlic naan, lamb soup, chicken mango curry, chicken and lamb curry. The basmati rice and garlic naan were out if this world, the meats were all tender and tasty. We also had chai tea and rice pudding and they were pretty good! The only down side is that the service was a little slow but we will definitely come back, the portions are very good and filling! :)"}
{"text":"Authentic. Great selection of vegan gluten free choices. Specify your spice level with caution! Food was served promptly, hot. Water was Frequently refilled. Live sitar music on our Friday eve visit. Will happily drive 15 miles to return."}
{"text":"I happened to be drawn to The Dhaba while traveling eastbound on Apache toward the 101. Something about the building, the restaurant and market, I'm not quite sure but I knew I wanted to check it out.   I ended up inquiring with others who have had it and they had only good things to say. So, I went in to order some take out the following day.   The menu all sounded good although admittedly there were so many items that in placing a to-go order I didn't really have the time to review all options available. I went with the Saag, with a level 7 spice. You really never know how spicy a 7 is going to be. I also ordered the curried goat for a colleague, along with their gluten free bread and a masala chai tea.  I will admit I was a bit bummed out when I took the meal back and there were no utensils and the rice was in a single container. Although, I am green conscious and it's probably for the better that there was less waste.   I was surprise that the chai was hot, I'm not sure why I expected it to be cold but I did. Nevertheless it was delicious, although next time I might order something else. The saag? Amazing! Like, no joke! Who would have thought something so pureed and spinach would be so good? I certainly didn't. Not the mention the level of spice was perfect! There were no complaints from my colleague although I didn't mention I'm quite the yelper.   Upon entering The Dhaba there is a wall of pride with award after award. The owner was actually who greeted me and was a very pleasant man, I truly do wish I had the chance to dine in and get a different experience. This just means I'll have to head back.   I will say it was a bit pricy, though in my world, all good food seems to be from the grocery store to the smoothie joint, sometimes when you want the quality, you gotta pay the price, literally.   Definitely a new fave! For sure."}
{"text":"I love the ambience.  Great food too! But the hostess is rude or doesn't know how to greet and treat people."}
{"text":"Will be going back again - food & service wonderful. The restaurant was full with a 45 minute wait for walk in's but I had made a reservation (or thought I had) through opentable. When we arrived the Hostess could not find our reservation but was so gracious - we were seated immediately. Only upoon further review of the confirmation email I found that I had made a mistake & reserved a table for Sunday, not Saturday. I told the Hostess & apologized & she completely understood. Great service!"}
{"text":"I actually like this place..I must say it's probably one of the best halal food place I've been in Arizona. I ordered a goat curry and a chicken masala. They're both good. The goat curry was more on the sweet side and I'm used to it (at other places) being on the salty and spicy side. Their garlic nann was pretty good, too.  Downside -- it's quite expensive..I don't know if I want to keep coming here..although the food was good, it was a bit too pricey for my range."}
{"text":"If I could give this place ZERO stars I would. My boyfriend and I were turned down with the excuse \"the kitchen is already cleaned up\" while we attempted to celebrate his birthday here. Umm, then why are there at least THREE tables waiting for their food...can't help but think our skin color contributed to this. I hope no interracial couples or black women ever spend a dime at this place. Apparently the owners forgot that all money is green. Won't ever try to come back and I hope people reading this take it to heart when I say we truly felt that our skin color contributed to us not being served."}
{"text":"Loved the service and food was amazing. Would definitely return again and suggest to all friends."}
{"text":"My family and I tried this place and loved it. We only go out for Indian food on occasion but we don't have a favorite spot. This is it now. Wonderful service and wonderful food. We tried two appetizers with the assortment of sauces that they serve, excellent. We also ordered 3 entrees and all was served family style with rice. They were out of something that I wanted to try which was ok because what they told us we could substitute was a dish that we ended up really liking. The owner also came over and comped the appetizer that he brought out as an apology which wasn't even necessary but very nice.   We have food allergies and everything on the menu was clearly marked for gluten free, vegetarian and vegan using little symbols before each item. Sometimes I am hesitant to eat out because I'm afraid of them putting gluten or dairy in my food or my daughter's but we did not have any problems with this meal. Also, my 6 year old who is not the most adventurous eater actually enjoyed the meal too and tried everything, which was a relief. The Gobi Pakore appetizer was one of our favorites, simple but now I'm craving it again today.  All of the food was very fresh and home-cooked. We will be back."}
{"text":"Everything I have ordered here or tasted from a friend's entry has been delicious.   I love Indian food anyway with its \"sneaky spice\" and delicious warm flavors.   The naan here is delicious, and one order could feed four to five people.   I have ordered the Dal Makhani, Punjabi Chole, Dil Bahar Korma, and Sialkoti Rajmeh, and all of these had delicious flavors and spice.  You can determine the level of spice, like most Indian restaurants.   The entries come with white or brown rice.   The only complaint I have is that it can take a while even after seated.  Both times I have gone for dine-in, it was fairly crowded, but it was at least 20 minutes before someone even came by to ask for our orders.  However, due to the extensive menu, this wasn't a problem, since there are many delicious items in which to choose, we needed that time!  Water refills are constant and the food comes out quite quick after ordered.   I'm also excited to know they are open till 10pm."}
{"text":"Ordered Dhaba for takeout once before. Decided I had, and I mean had, to check it out in person. The food is fresh and delicious.   This is far superior to any other Indian restaurant and I've tried many. The difference, for me, was the quality. I'm pretty picky and my girlfriend is as well. She's not too big on Indian food.  Well, after taking one bite of Dhaba's tikki masala she was in the culinary pleasure zone. At the end of the meal she said it was her favorite restaurant in Arizona.   You can taste the freshness of everything. Meat, rice, naan. All the food was cooked to perfection and the flavor profiles were outstanding.   Service is a 5/5. Prices are completely fair, especially given the quality.   Try it."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, but grossly overpriced for what you get if you don't go for one of the weekday lunch specials. Friendly service, interesting decor, plus it's fun to check out the other shops The Dhaba shares its building with."}
{"text":"I was so glad I actually had time to try this authentic Punjabi Indian restaurant located on Apache Boulevard. Outside, they have a number of rickshaws which make excellent photo ops, as well as a Tandoori oven. Inside, you will be pleasantly surprised to find a small, quaint restaurant with about a dozen tables. It definitely has that mom-and-pop type of feel. The menu is expansive, had wine pairings in the margins, and their spice scale is from 1 to 10. We started off the meal with mango lassi (really creamy and refreshing) and complementary papadum. Instead of the usual brown tamarind or green cilantro chutney, they actually have a third chutney that will make you sweat and clear your sinuses with about two bites.  We decided to order two meat dishes and two veggie dishes, one of each would be super spicy and the rest would be mild so the whole family including the kids could enjoy. We ordered: chicken korma, tava sabji, lamb curry, palik kofta, a spiced veggie dish, and two types of Naan. Basmati rice was included. All the food was wonderfully spiced and well balanced. Our two spicy dishes, which we had requested a seven, was too mild. The chicken and lamb were extremely tender and broken apart with your fork.   Speaking of forks, each place setting must've cost $100. All of the plates, utensils, and cups were handmade copper imported from India. The drinking cup would have made a fine Moscow Mule cup.  For dessert we received our free complementary house desert by checking in on yelp, as well as the ras malai. Both were fantastic and did not overdo the cardamom.   Service did feel rushed. Naturally, the place is small, so they want to turn the tables over quickly. They need to take a chill pill.   Additionally, another huge negative is that they are located next to a gas station were a lot of undesirables were hanging out. I went to check in my car twice just to make sure it was not broken into.   I definitely can't wait to come back and try more items from the expansive menu"}
{"text":"This has been a staple in my life for the last two years. I have eaten there on busy nights, on slow afternoons and i have ordered taken out. I don't vary from what i order and i am always satisfied.  I will agree with most the reviews below that the services has been very weak in the past. Everything from uninterested waiters that i had to pry recommendations out of, to pushy waiters that try to force stuff on me. (I didn't want the damn chi-tea! I don't care if it came with the meal. It tasted like crap anyway!) While normally i don't care much about how soon they get my water filled, when i am eating curry that tends to be pretty spicy... i need water, NOW!  After that rant about the service, i will say one last little negative thing. I order the meal special, and with out fail every time the desert has changed. I'm not complaining because it is always good, but can we get some consistency here?  BUT,  Sometimes, i needed Dhaba curry! I need to so bad, nothing will satisfy until i have it."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a Friday night when visiting family in the Phoenix area.  It was crowded but we didn't have to wait for a table.  They have a very extensive menu with a lot of vegetarian and gluten free options.  It took a while to figure out what to get though because there were so many things to read.  Plus, because everything was in Punjabi, we had to read the descriptions of each dish.  Luckily, there were papadams and chutneys to snack on.  All the dishes sounded really good!  We ended up getting the tandoori khazana with a mix of chicken and lamb tandoori that was super tasty.  The lamb and the shrimp were succulent and flavorful, and the chicken really captured the smoky tandoori flavor.  Our second dish was palak paneer and our third was the lamb korma.  The paneer was pretty good, and the spinach quite creamy, and with just the slightest bit of heat.  The lamb korma was awesome.  The curry is similar to tikka masala but way better with cashews and raisins; the lamb was first rate in flavor and tenderness of the meat.  We also ordered dessert: pistachio ice cream made on site.  It was icy and delicious and melted in your mouth with an amazing creaminess.  The pistachio flavor really shined in the dessert.  We left stuffed!  What a great meal!  The ambiance was very nice, with beautiful colors and a warm feeling.  The lighting was not too bright, but not so dark that you couldn't see the food on your plate.  The servers were chatty and pleasant. But the cart they wheeled dishes out on seemed really out of place.  Overall, I'd come here again if I were in the area.  A great experience and a delicious dinner."}
{"text":"-- ONE YEAR UPDATE --  Still consistently good. Love this place. There is always a groupon available. Definitely a good deal. Me and the wife always get 2 meals out of one dinner here. MUST EAT!!"}
{"text":"Aaaah, real Indian and Pakistani food!  I'm a snoot, I'll admit- after leaving Chicago and Devon Avenue, I've always been disappointed by what passes for \"Indian\" out west... but the Dhaba blew me away.   I took some visit family here for dinner last weekend after reading positive reviews on Yelp, and was sooo not disappointed.  First- and I love this, because I'm lazy- you can make your reservation on Yelp.  Literally three clicks and I had a reservation for four at seven.  Sure enough, our table was ready and waiting for us- and I watched several other parties of various sizes show up and wait at least fifteen minutes to be seated, so I was feeling smug before our lhassi was even on the table.    Service is a little patchy (we had to request water twice, and flag down a waitress for our check) but the food is so dang good I don't even care.  Order whatever you want off the amazing, huge menu- it will be good.  I promise.  My relatives had never had Indian before (I know, I don't get it either) so I steered them toward the traditional favorite chicken tikka masala.  We requested it mild and I think our server translated that, correctly, to \"for old white people.\"  The relatives loved it, and I looooved my kafta, and the fact that when you say, \"I want it spicy!\"  the kitchen makes it spicy!      The portions are very generous, which means lots of amazing leftovers to sit in your fridge and get even more spicy depth and flavor over the next day or two.  And the rice pudding- deeelish!  The only thing that I wouldn't rave about was the Masala chai tea, and that's just because I like my chai blend with a little more punch, and this had quite a bit of milk in it.    The ambiance is lovely and perfect for a romantic evening, a place to take your folks when they're visiting and you want to prove you're All Grown Up, or an upscale but not crazy-expensive girls' night out."}
{"text":"Great Indian food! The food is absolutely delicious. They've got a  pretty large variety of items on the menu, so be sure to explore it a little.  The service was also very good. From the time we entered until we left, it was all about service.  Great experience, highly recommended, and we'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Great lunch! Not a large portion per meal and some items are not paired with sides. This is not your quantity over quality type of place. Food was excellent and extremely tasty.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The Dhaba was not what I expected in that, the interior is actually well done.  I know that seems odd, but I'm so used to walking into a new Indian restaurant and being a bit irritated by the cheesy decor.    Anyhow, this place is just an alright Indian restaurant.  I ordered my standard chicken tikka masala and enjoyed it.  The spiciness wasn't where I wanted it to be, but I'm used to that.  It wasn't amazing, but it also wasn't bad.  Just okay.  Pierre puts it well in his review- \"the tastiness of the food is good but unspectacular by Indian restaurant standards.\"  Our service was average.  The man working seemed to want to help us out, but forgot things on a few occasions throughout the meal.    With the convenience of a being right near a light rail stop, I'd most definitely stop here again if I were craving Indian and in Tempe, but I don't believe I'd go out of my way to come back here.  Just another okay Indian place in PHX."}
{"text":"We experienced Dhaba with a Groupon.  We went there during an off hour so the place was relatively empty.  We were humored when the staff asked if we had reservations.  Was that necessary?  Lovely atmosphere and the staff is attentive. We ordered the plate specials.  Mine came with naan, chicken curry, chana masala, dahl and rice.    The rice is like a fried rice with various veggies in it.  A nice change from the usual.  We both ordered medium spicy and it was just right.  Had the food been any spicier, it would have ruined the taste.  Hubby had the naan, lamb curry, dahl, tandoori chicken and rice.  It was all delicious.  Our meal was complete with chai and rice pudding with a mango flavoring.  There was plenty of  leftovers for the next day.  We would definitely go back as we thought this was one of the best places for Indian food."}
{"text":"The Dhaba is actually the best Indian restaurant for food in the Phoenix metro, and deserves a 5 star for food. We rate a 3 star to help them get better on service. We ordered a Biryani dish and 2 curry dishes and a garlic naan. The curry dishes each came with basmati rice, but they only gave us one basmati telling us we will not need the other because of the biryani. They said we could ask for the other basmati if we still wanted it later. We felt cheated because we paid for two basmati and expected two basmati without having to ask for more. This place is really expensive, too, and for them to try and cheat people out of rice is just not right. They could also improve on service by checking in to see that all is well at the table, and that our needs are met."}
{"text":"While the food is excellent, service is slow and the kitchen slower.  We have been here many times but won't be back.  Had a 6:30 reservation and didn't get out until 8:30!  After being seated, it took about 15 minutes for someone to take our order.  We waited over half an hour to have the food brought to our table.  Restaurant needs more waitstaff and more people in the kitchen.  VERY SLOW and inefficient."}
{"text":"Huge menu! If you're new to indian food be prepared to be confused. Waiter was helpful with recommendations. Chicken Tikka Masala was delicious as was the garlic naan. The Vindaloo was spicy! It comes at a 10 spice level. I took one bite and my head decided to go swimming. In my sweat. Good thing is they keep the place extremely chilly and serve water in these metal cups that keep the water ice cold. Service was also great. They kept that ice cold water refilled as I was trying to put the fire out in my mouth."}
{"text":"Where do I even start, this place is an absolute gem so good, the best Indian food I've ever had in my life.. Reminds me so much of being in the middle east. I got the Tikka Masala and the curried chick peas. I recommend everything on the menu"}
{"text":"Great food. This place is cozy, and had water, flat bread, and 3 sauces ready to go at our table when we sat down.  Staff was just the right amount of attentive. Price was quite reasonable for the amount of food we got.  Favorite Indian place I have gone to in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I stopped at this place while doing a party bus event. How fun!! Ms Cenestra Lemons was our tour guide. She is fun, engaging and makes everyone fee welcome.  This place had some delicious food and a good thai tea.  Will return with my family."}
{"text":"Good food. The wait time was too long for a pick up. Their dal makhani was good, seriously!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to celebrate my birthday a little early. We had received a Groupon for the Dhaba as a Christmas gift and decided to use it on 01-01-13.    Upon walking into to nearly empty restaurant, we were seated and told our server would be with us. Once she discovered we had the Groupon, she told us they didn't accept them on this day because it was a holiday. We promptly left.   Once in our car we checked the Groupon and discovered that New Year's Day was not one of the days listed as a day the coupon would not be accepted. So what the heck?   This is our second time at the Dhaba. After receiving shoe-leather lamb and being told it was always cooked that way, we almost didn't want to give it a second chance. After not being able to use a perfectly good coupon on day not listed in the fine print, we will not be returning to the Dhaba.    We'll eat at Star of India on Chandler Blvd. instead. The lamb there is cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food. Vast menu and you can get mild to very spicy. The naan is the best I've ever had in phoenix. I also like that they put the estimated calories on each meal. The service was excellent and the owner has a an awesome life story."}
{"text":"I can't stop raving about this place its a bit pricey but their food is amazing. All of their meat is juicy and flavorful. I've never been disappointed with the service.  I'm in love with their Samosas and Garlic naan. I wish it was endless!! Everyone I take here loves it. My only word of advice is to be sure you ask for the spice level you really want and commit to it lol."}
{"text":"Yum!!!!!  This was my first time trying Indian food & I am now hooked!  We arrived around 8pm on a Thursday & the place was packed & we were told it would be about a 45 minute wait, we decided to stay and we got lucky & were seated in about 10 minutes.  We were so happy that we waited.  The food was absolutely delicious, so much flavor.  The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because once we ordered, we never saw our waitress again & we had to ask the bus boy for more water & he even took our dessert order."}
{"text":"Every time I get a craving for Indian food, The Dhaba always satisfies. With the intimate environment, great food and great service, The Dhaba was a great experience.   My wife and I had their lunch special and was provided a full course meal for a great bargain. The meal started with a fresh salad. I ordered the lamb and it was tasty and didn't have the smell that most other Indian restaurants have I. Their lamb dishes. The sauce and garlic naan was delicious. My wife had the chicken tikka masala and that was great as well. To top off the meal was a clean rice pudding that refreshed the palate. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place used to be chaat corner - its recieved some massive plastic surgery. Nice ambiance, not any way like an authentic indian dhaba, but the food inside makes up for it.  The lamb curry was thick, spicy, and rich in potatoes. It made my stomach happy.  Stay away from the goat curry. That curry singlehandedly took away a star. It was flavorful enough, but it was thin and the quality of the meat was questionable.  The thalis won't disappoint - they're reminescent of thalis from north Indian dhabas.    The desserts are authentic. And they usually bring you out free fresh hot tea.  We went in a big group and our waiter was pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Like the good from The Dhaba.  It's a little pricey.  They occasionally have groupons which makes it more reasonable.  They're very into having reservations.  It's a small restaurant and when we've gone, their tables fill up.  I do recommend calling ahead.  The Faislabadi Aam Murgh is very good if you want to try something new."}
{"text":"The Dhaba has been on my wife's list for a long time, and I'm glad she finally convinced me to go, because it was amazing.  I'm not that familiar with Indian cuisine, and the dinner menu at Dhaba is extensive, so it took a while to figure things out.    Tip:  Make a reservation.  We did and were sat immediately at a table marked \"reserved\".  We noted several parties who arrived while we were having dinner who did not make reservations and were actually turned away entirely.  MAKE A RESERVATION.    I had a double deuce Indian beer called Kingfisher that was enjoyable, ordered a chaat and pakoras for the table to start (don't remember which ones and I don't see either of them on the online menu unfortunately), and the shehenghahi palak kofta for my main course, along with a Jantar Mantar (assortment of four kinds of naan bread) for the table.     Meanwhile, they bring out a plate with papadums and the three chutneys ranging from sweet/mild to medium/hot to hot/hot.  The hot hot was very hot, and my favorite was the sweet/mild which I believe was a tamarind.   All were delicious.    We actually asked for a second cup of the tamarind chutney it went so quickly.    The chaat was chick peas in a sauce with a naan bread-like base under the sauce and it was incredible.  Very tasty and not at all spicy.  It might have been the samosa chaat, but I'm not sure.  Either way, we all loved it.    The pakora \"street treat\" came in a pair and was also quite delicious.  They're like fritters, and actually fairly large for what they are.  We found ourselves spreading some of the tamarind chutney on them as well.    Next was my shehenghahi palak kofta \"fit for royalty\" vegetarian dish.   I really am not even sure how to describe this dish other than a heavy green sauce with cheese dumplings in it.   The flavor was out of this world!   I decided to man up and ordered it at a 6 out of 10 spice level.  I enjoy spicy food, and 6 out of 10 made me sweat.  It was very hot.  Definitely cleared out my sinuses haha.   What I find amazing is that they can adjust the heat level without impacting flavor.  I would order this same exact dish again, but take it down to a 4 on the spice level and I think I'd truly enjoy it.  I highly recommend this dish.    We all also enjoyed the Jantar Mantar assortment of naan breads and it was a huge portion for the 3 of us!  We ended up taking most of the naan home.     My one beer, my wife's 2 glasses of wine, step daughter's special Dhaba lemonade, 2 apps, 3 entrees, an extra side of rice and the assortment of naan breads came to a total of about $105.   If we had stuck to water, it would have put it in the $$ range but with the drinks it was definitely in the $$$ range....and WORTH IT.     Next time we go, I'll try desert if there's room in the belly!   We had a ton of leftovers to take home this time around.  Like a full 2nd meal for 3 people worth of leftovers...."}
{"text":"This little restaurant may serve up the best Indian fare I have ever eaten.  It is indeed a rather small and unpretentious place in the center of Indian Plaza.  There might be ten tables at most and reservations are a must.  They actually had to turn away people while we were eating.  The menu is enormous, the foods well described and the choices unique--even for Punjabi cuisine.  The chili stuffed Naan was delicious and different.  The chicken vindaloo was rich and fragrant, if a little on the tepid side of the heat scale for me-- but then again just about all food is unless I order it spicy.  The okra was the best I have ever had and my wife's chicken tikki was superb.  The food was served quickly and the servers were friendly although a bit distracted.  We drove 45 minutes from Anthem to eat here and we will return.  I highly recommend The Dhaba."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue, as Dhaba has been perhaps the favorite restaurant if my wife and I for the last 5 years! Simply put: we have never have had a bad item here...it's amazing Indian food and accompaniments. We especially love the chicken curry and various naan breads. They also have a pretty good beer & wine list. Also, the atmosphere is very relaxing - perfect for a date night or small group gathering."}
{"text":"You have to have a picky Indian to recommend and suggest a menu for you to enjoy this place. We had a good offer for a menu that included (Pappad & chutnies, appetizer samosa/pakora, a chicken dish, Malai Kofta (vegetable fritter in a tomato cream sauce), Daal, Naan, Rice, Ras Malai (dessert) and of course Chai.  Everything tasted really good and was more than enough to leave us satisfied! It is a bit small, but cozy, and the owners were around, so we had a really good attention. Unlike other \"indian places\" this one had much more flavor!! Good thing is around the corner from where I live :)"}
{"text":"Mmmm... I love this place. My friend and I found it on accident several years ago. I always get the Kashmiri Chicken Tikka Masala and naan. Lots of naan; garlic and plain to dip into the sauce of my chicken tikka masala!!!   Took my husband there last night for his first time trying Indian food. He got one of the grilled items Murgh Seekh Kabab. The herbs and spices were really strong and probably not a good choice for a first timer. The owners recognized that he didn't eat any if it and took it off our bill. They sincerely apologized and told is to ask them for advice the next time we go there."}
{"text":"Great food but very expensive. Several nearby places offer same quality at lower price."}
{"text":"As I am writing this for whatever reason the Punjab Pimp Daler Mehndi is thumping in my head \" Tunook, Tunook mmm Da Da Da\". I first want to mention the extreme politeness I get whenever I call to place a take out order. They, unlike other Indian cuisine restaurants want my business...yours too; and it shows. The menu is very broad which I love. They have full vegan entrees, although I am not close to being vegan I do love alot of vegetable dishes and DHABA has many. The vegetable \"meatballs\" are outstanding. I have never had a bad meal hear although some of my favorite go-to foods I can find better eleswhere. So everytime I do eat here I get something new. My go to items by the way are Mushroom Matar, Palak paneer and a protein i.e. Lamb, goat or chicken. The dishes here always are fresh, fragrant, plentiful, bright and overall spiced very nice. I prefer VERY HOT food in temperature and they nail it; I prefer my food extremely hot in spice too which they tend to be mellow on for my taste buds. Please, Sir Chef...Go on and hurt me with the magical indian spices, it's ok. If I order a ten it should be blazing!! With all this said DHABA is unique in it's offerings, clean in presentation and overall a pretty good Indian joint!! I will continue to eat there. If you are an employee of ANY INDIAN restaurant in Arizona here me now. You are from the continent ASIA....take a cue from your counterparts and GIVE RICE WITH DISHES FOR FREE. JUST PLAIN WHITE RICE!! I do get irked that this cuisine charges for this plain starch."}
{"text":"Been going here regularly for a while. Now sometimes we get it and it is watered down and isn't as spicy as it used to be; this has happened on two occasions thus far. The rice is strange sometimes too. I don't know if they changed cooks or not. The soft drinks are $3 each which is outrageous. We have also experienced the 18% tip issue mentioned on here before. $17 per person for lunch! It is a shame because it used to be so good. :-("}
{"text":"Changing my rating to 3 1/2 stars based on the fact that the owner contacted me about my experience there and seemed truly apologetic for it.  He has offered me & my husband to come in for lunch and he will see to it that our experience (service) is better than the last time.  As I said in my original review, we liked the food, it was the service that was so lacking.  Looking forward to trying it again and may re-rate again. (Thanks Raveen)"}
{"text":"Experience in a single word - HORRIBLE . Went two times there and came back with horrible experience. First time I visited with my friends at 8:40pm and the manager or the owner told us that the restaurant was close whereas on their website closing time was 9pm. On the very next day, we again went there this time reserving a table for 8pm and again we were disappointed as they couldn't accommodate us by giving a shitty excuse and attitude. I feel they don't give a shit about their customers especially the NEW ones and the whole staff is arrogant. I don't think I would visit this place again or would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The Dhaba never disappoints!  The staff is always friendly and professional. You are always greeted and appreciated. The food is amazing and puts you in a euphoric state, the spices and aromas impact the senses. Love, love this place. My Punjab grandfather would eat here and love it"}
{"text":"This Punjabi is a Must Have!  By far best Indian (Punjab) cuisine my wife and I have encountered in the Valley of the Sun!  Taking advantage of Restaurant Week, we were able to thoroughly enjoy a both esthetic and flavorful, if not flamboyant trip to India within The Dhaba's culinary and décor environment!  The moment you arrive, you are struck by their museum-like front displaying glass encased ornaments, clothing and more such as kurtis with Phulkari - and exhibited are Indian Auto Rickshaws showing both incredible intricate hand-made design and real wear!  And, the as you enter the front door, you set foot into a very traditional and very authentic environment seeming to take you back in time to Raj also known as the British India period!  Keep in mind this area of the world dates its heritage and cuisine to the Indus Valley Civilization (dating as far back as 1900 BCE).  This Northern Indian Cuisine which boasts Pakistani influences (Pakistan borders Punjab) drives its influence in their incredible foods.  Both my wife and I enjoyed everything we tried, quite a bit.  The prices are very reasonable, considering the hefty portions they dish (which in many instances will require boxes for take-home!), and the quality and adherence to authenticity The Dhaba offers.  Regarding the food, starting with my wife's white wine and I a large bottle of Taj Mahal Beer, we then took the opportunity to try starting with their: Samosa Plate (very refreshing and unique salad), freshly baked Naan Bread; my wife had the Cashmiri Chicken Tikka Masala (chicken breast marinated in traditional spices and yogurt and prepared in a Tandoori) while I had the exquisite and tender rendition of the Lamb Curry (lamb cubes with Dhaba spices) we finished off with deserts of Badami Kheer and wonderful Indian Rice Pudding, and I had the Gulab Gamun (spongy milky balls in rose syrup!  As I mentioned, by far the best we've had in the area.  Highly recommended to Aficionádos and newbies to Punjab alike!  Great atmosphere, attention, service, price and quality... a very enjoyable experience - we'll be back!  Bon appétit from Gástro Ecléctico.         ('you will enjoy your meal')."}
{"text":"Positives :  - No qualms about the entrees. Really good food - always rich and flavorful .   Negatives :  - Salad has a bitter taste & would be great if they are at least flexible in replacing the salad with lassi - so that people get to enjoy the better things Dhaba has to offer - Customer service - the lady at the entrance is extremely disinterested and never friendly"}
{"text":"Chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, chicken korma, lamb vindaloo, keema samosas, chilli-pepper naan, garlic naan, carrot fudge, rice pudding, raita, basmati rice, adjustable spice level 1-10, generous and grateful staff, soft sitar and tabla playing in the background, what more could I ask?"}
{"text":"I tried this place a while back. It was very good from what I remember. I had curry and it was spiced pretty well, it had a tomato like taste to it. I'm not sure if this is \"Indian curry flavor\" as I am Filipino and we use coconut milk. It was still very good and there were decent portions. The atmosphere was nice (although if I'm honest atmosphere doesn't matter in the presence of good food). It was a bit expensive for me as I am a student, but it was still worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. Order it via postmates all the time and after a lot of searching for really good indian in AZ I feel like I found it!"}
{"text":"Food was really good. Very spicy so go with a low number if you want it mildly spicy."}
{"text":"Very good Indian food. Went there with a party of 4. The beers were a bit pricy but the food's quality for the price matched. The heat level of the food was spot on. A 1-10 scale very true to what you say. Service was great especially for a Indian restaurant. I would highly recommend the shrimp curry and the chicken tikka masala     The menu is huge. Something for everyone."}
{"text":"The Dhaba is my go-to Indian good place, I love it!!! It is the best Indian food I've had in the valley. It's very small and I recommend making a reservation in advance to be safe. On occasion they do put out a groupon that is insane!   Foods I recommend: Chai tea (free refills!) Chicken tikka masala Paneer tikka masala Lamb vindaloo Garlic naan Raita"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Indian food, and The Dhaba is as good as it gets. Raveen, the owner gave us the best service as he chatted with us and shared his story, which is amazing.   I ordered the fish vindaloo and it was the freshest, juiciest fish I have had with an exquisite sauce. It was so good I HAD to bring a dish home for my wife, which was the chicken tikka masala. Her words after eating was \"that was Amazing!\"  It just doesn't get better than this. Do yourself a favor and try it out!"}
{"text":"Even being of Indian decent, I've never really cared for this type of food. A few years ago, I visited this place for the first time and fell in love! The flavors are so unique and the atmosphere is so peaceful. Next to the amazing food, the service is good and the restaurant is always clean. Before you come, take the time to make a reservation online or by phone."}
{"text":"My favorite go to Indian restaurant. Friendly staff and delicious menu. The lunch specials are where it's at."}
{"text":"We did not make the trek to the east side with The Dhaba on our minds... But as we drove past it to our intended destination, I said \"look honey, that's Dhaba, it gets great reviews and has been written up in Phoenix Magazine.\"  The Main Man replied, \"its Indian, right? We like Indian, that naan bread, mmmmmm.\"  So we did what we went east to do and decided we had to give The Dhaba a go.  There was NO wait even though we had no reservation.  The hostess/waitress/manager was an absolutely gorgeous young woman who was very much into our learning experience and helped us sound out and pronounce our orders, lamb dishes for both of us.  We were given water and tea in a more than timely manner and the slight wait for our hand-made, fresh food was well worth it!  MM got the basmati rice and I opted, reluctantly as I steer clear of most carbs unless they are chocolate cake or cookies, for the brown rice.  Both were FABULOUS with the moist, tender lamb.  Both dishes of lamb were spicy without burning and the flavor was FINALLY noticeable... Most Indian food in the Valley honestly lacks heat, kick, and flavor... These dishes delivered in all three.  What I did not notice until it was time for the 'go' box is that the brown rice has the most elegant, aromatic scent.  I may not actually eat it, but I will go to the fridge a million times just to smell it!   All in all, we were lucky to grab up a table with no reservation, the food was awesome, the service pleasantly solid.  We are just sad The Dhaba is way across town..."}
{"text":"YUM! Best Indian in Phoenix/Tempe. You can smell how great this place is from the parking lot. Service is super friendly and informative. Everything tasted amazing!"}
{"text":"The food gets 5 stars most definitely. What brought our experience down was one of the servers. We had contact with two. One was a younger lady who seemed to be irritated that we had little experience ordering at an Indian restaurant and needed a little help with the menu. When she attempted to explain her accent was so thick we still found it hard to understand what we were doing. when asked to repeat herself she became even more irritated and only spoke louder, she then left the table and could be overheard saying 'I don't know what to tell her' in reference to my date's very basic questions.   Then an older lady who appeared to be the owner came to our table and was fantastic, she explained everything to us and was very attentive for the rest of the meal.   I would eat there again however it seems that they are big on making reservations. This didn't really occur to us as it was late Friday afternoon and we were thinking we'd get an early 'happy hour' dinner in at the end of a busy day rather than going home and getting ready for a later more formal dinner later in the evening.   All in all, good food, good service if you have reservations if this is your first time with Indian food do your homework before getting there and you should be fine."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love Indian food and have tried several other places in the area, this one is by far our favorite! The lamb korma is exquisite! The staff is warm and friendly, the restaurant itself is clean and inviting. Truly a unique little hole in the wall and I would recommend this place to anyone in need of some good Indian food!"}
{"text":"The food is really great. A couple of us went in there a week or so ago to try it out. Neither of us are too familiar with Indian food and we were a little concerned, but it was amazing. Everything we had was delicious. The restaurant was very clean and the service was excellent. We weren't a fan of the desserts, but everything else was very good. The portions are large, so we had plenty to take home. We will definitely be back soon to try some other items."}
{"text":"I've eaten lots of curry throughout my life.   This curry was just okay.   The menu is massive and offers a lot of variety, for someone unfamiliar with the cuisine it's quite daunting.   Since I was trying out this restaurant for the first time I decided to try something I was very familiar with and ordered a shrimp masala.  The dish was seasoned heavily, like any Indian dish should be, but the flavors didn't really seem to balance out  very well, all of the seasonings tasted a bit off, and were a bit overbearing in a funny tasting way.  But alas, not bad by any means of the imagination.  I cleaned off the plate and would try it again.  The shrimp itself was wonderful, very fresh and well cooked.  The garlic naan was to die for, it was one of the best naans I've ever had.  Cooked to perfection.   Judging from other reviews, I'm not sure if we just came in on an off night or what, but the service was not good at all.  We were probably sitting for 15-20 minutes before someone came over and took our drink orders, and this was not on a busy night.  Our server didn't seem particularly happy to be there.  The food took a little while to come out, but I expect that when ordering more elaborate meals, and was not at all turned off by this.    The restaurant has a little side-shop, which sells British and Indian goodies, which was delightful.  A definite plus."}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying that if you are a fan of Indian food, then this is the place for you.  We were a party of about 20, and they had no problem accommodating us. When we arrived at 6:00, our table was set and waiting for us. The restaurant is nicely decorated, and has a quiet atmosphere. Some of the smaller, intimate tables would be a good place to take a date! But, I digress.  For starters, they brought out a very thin, fragile cracker and 3 different sauces to dip it in. The sauces are not for the faint hearted. I recommend that you order a mango lassi immediately if you need to handle heat.  For starters, I ordered the samosa's, and they were flavorful and cooked to perfection. An assortment of main dishes were ordered ranging from Chicken Tikka Masala to Lamb Vindaloo ordered extra hot, along with a melange of other dishes.  While the heat level might be good for most people, I and one of my companions really like the heat, and we felt that the Tikka Masala and the Vindaloo needed to be even hotter than they were. Then again, a member of our party tried each one of them and pronounced their mouth to be on fire, so perhaps we just have asbestos linings. This restaurant is beautifully clean, including the restrooms.  There is a small store attacked to the restaurant that has everything from ingredients to nicknacks for sale.  Each person in our party enjoyed the dinner, and there was narry a complaint about anything. Service was attentive without being overbearing.  4 stars for quality, cleanliness and service."}
{"text":"I had chicken biryani here..what they served was not even close..din't look or taste like biryani..it was more like pulao/sambar rice(another rice-based Indian dish)..but they do have very delicious entrees...go for the entrees, no biryani please.."}
{"text":"I have been to The Dhaba many times in the past, before I started Yelping.  The food, drinks, and Asian lady who runs the place is always first-rate.  In the past, I would have always rated them 5-star.  Last night's visit was different. The food, drinks, and Asian lady who runs the place were very enjoyable as always, however, aside from those elements, improvement was needed.    Firstly, we had to wait for everything.  There was no one up front to greet us for quite some time, so we had to wait to be seated.  Then we had to wait for water and menus.  Next came the long wait for drinks. We did NOT have to wait long for the food, but the waiting kicked-in again when we had to wait for the bill and wait again to have it processed.  By far the most irritating event of the evening is when some old Indian guy upfront (who we have never seen there before) took it upon himself, not only to take forever to work up  the bill, but to add a 20% tip on top of the food, drink and tax charge.  Now there were just four of us dining -- my husband and two kids -- not a large, noisy, demanding party by any means.  He literally added a line with a dollar amount that amounted to 20% of the total bill. To add insult to injury, he also left the \"tip\" line BLANK, in hopes that I would add even more!!!!!  I wrote \"INCLUDED\" on the tip line, along with a \"nice try\" comment.  I definitely would have tipped our nice Asian lady 20%, as we always do, but I resent that some old guy had the audacity to do it for me.  It takes us 30 minutes to drive there from our home, and this last experience will make it questionable if we do so again this year."}
{"text":"Made a reservation and when we arrived, found our table waiting. Service was good, with the exception of waiting to pay the check, which is a personal pet peeve of mine.   I had my standard dish of Lamb Vindaloo. When asked how hot from 1-10 that I would like it, she mentioned it is normally 8. I choose 10 as I am a fan of very hot food. It came as a 7 - spicy, flavorful but not as hot as I would have liked. Still very good, but the portion had too many potatoes and not enough lamb. I am willing to pay $17 for an entree with lamb, it is a rare treat. While tasty, the portion was very skimpy.  My wife's dish was delicious. And ironically seemed spicier than mine.  The nan was very good. Nicely baked. The riata, a yogurt dish used to cool and balance spicy dishes was thicker and the veggies in it smaller than I used to.  Overall good food. I would return."}
{"text":"The Dhaba is definitely one of the best Indian food restaurants in the Valley by far!!!  The other one we like is the Dheli Palace for their lunch buffet.  We usually try a lunch buffet first before deciding whether to invest in dinner cause Indian cuisine is very pricey. Due to all the rave reviews we decided to go for it and have become fans ever since.  We are always surprised when the place is not so busy because the food is excellent.  I think the fact that they do not have a buffet has something to do with this.  For most who are not familiar with the cuisine of India, ordering can be a daunting task which is why buffets really work with Indian food.  I am of Indian decent (1st generation) so I know my way around the dishes and have been able to guide both friends and family through the rich assortment of Indian dishes, but if you don't have a guide it can be a little scary, just saying, a buffet might be the way to go to give business a boost.  We love the Dhaba, give it a shot you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Busy though and pricey. Make reservations ahead of time and get there early so your table is ready by the time your reservation is set for."}
{"text":"All-star Indian food again! My wife and I stepped out for some Indian cuisine this evening and we're delighted yet again with The Dhaba.   I literally opened my Yelp app, looked up my review, we ordered the same things, and it was wonderful. We got a little lively and went with a heat index of 7 this time (too hot for the wife, we're sticking with 6 from now on). Service was on point, food was amazing, atmosphere is authentic.   Thanks again for an amazing dining experience!"}
{"text":"Very good food the jalapeño naan was really good?  Very nice atmosphere just like Being in India"}
{"text":"The food is good I have always been a regular here more with pick up,after a long day I prefer to call and place my order so i don't have to go there and wait but the time duration specified by them is more than 25 minutes which is a tad too much.  Also they refused the free In House dessert which was a deal on yelp for check in,they said it was not valid on pickup! Wish they would step up the service and make it as good as the food.  I will keep coming back because the food has never disappointed,the service however is questionable!  They also have a little store next door which is great if you're looking for Indian spices."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. The chicken curry is so tender and delicious. The biryani is fresh and flavorful. The dal is comfort in a bowl. I haven't had as good a cup of chai in a very long time. And, of course, the Badami Kheer (punjabi-style rice pudding) was light and tasty. My only complaint is the drinking water--it seems that The Dhaba uses unfiltered tap water. Highly recommended, though, and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. They serve you wrong dish. Then, not even apologetic about it. Worst, they point out to you that they are doing a great favor to you by not charging the wrongly served dish.....will never visit this place in future."}
{"text":"Pretty good and pretty authentic. I forget which part of India they said the food was from. I dined here on business based on the good Yelp reviews. People are pretty spot on giving this place good reviews. The food was good and felt very \"home cooked.\" It was interesting that the server described the food as \"home cooked\" as well without my prompting. She gave us a little history of the word \"Dhaba\" too. The rice was not your typical Indian basmati. It was a little thinner and different consistency and mouth feel. I didn't like that very much. Everything else was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"After getting my car's oil changed at Hon-Man, I was feeling a bit peckish and decided to indulge in some tasty Indian cuisine since The Dhaba was a hop, skip, and a jump away. I wanted an order to-go, and inquired about getting a lunch special (No buffet, but they do have some great looking daily lunch specials). Unfortunately, they will only give you the lunch deals if you eat in, so I browsed through the extensive regular menu. The prices seemed a little high compared to other Indian restaurants in Tempe. I decided on The Dhaba signature saag (Spinach) dish ($12).   There is a cute little waiting area where you can wait for your food to be made. Service was exceptional, especially since it was to-go! The friendly hostess at the counter offered me some water while I waited, and even offered to refresh the cup with more water for my trip back home. The order came in a nice little brown shopping bag with handles, the kind you would find at higher-end restaurants.  When I opened up the bag, I had a really large portion of saag and basmati rice. The saag had a nice balance of flavors and textures. I could taste fresh ginger, some creaminess, and the delicate flavor of the spinach. I had asked for it medium spicy, and it was about right- not too spicy, not too mild. The basmati rice was cooked well, had some vibrantly colored grains and was fragrant from the addition of spices such as cardamom and cumin.  Overall, it was a pleasant meal, and I have more than enough leftovers for a few more meals. I'd love to dine in another time to try out more dishes, and their lunch!"}
{"text":"Simply walking in provided me with a promising feeling. This was going to be real authentic Indian cuisine; that I had no doubt about. The air was filled with wafts of spices and herbs that were absolutely mouth-watering. The atmosphere screamed Indian culture and I almost believed I had left the country and entered into India itself. Along with the restaurant there was a quaint little Indian market right next door that was extremely time consuming while they prepared a table for your meal. It was filled with all sorts of Indian delicacies along with Indian clothing and décor. It most definitely added to the authentic Indian experience.        Once we were seated, we were greeted by an exceptionally friendly waiter who seemed genuinely concerned that we had a pleasurable time. It was clear that his ultimate goal was to make sure we had what we needed when we needed it. It was almost as if he was a mind reader and knew exactly when we needed something. This is one thing that can make or break the dining experience and they nailed it right on the head. The service alone would make me return to The Dhaba.       Finally for the crucial component of any restaurant, the food. Just as everything else I was blown out of the water after taking the first bite of my Murgh Seekh Kabab. It was beyond divine, so much so, I couldn't find the will to put my fork down. The flavors bursted every which way in my mouth; the dhaba spices and herbs which the chicken was marinated in took life. I will have to admit I was a little skeptical before coming to try this food but I must say I am well pleased with everything. The Dhaba is something I would recommend to anyone that is curious to try authentic Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"At 1pm on a Wednesday we were the only customers.  Service was friendly, but slow. The 2 servers/manager were too busy chatting on the phone in the back or eating their own lunch.  Another group departing as we came in seemed to be waiting at the front counter for about 10 minutes for the girl in the office to finish her phone call and close their tab.    Food was good, reasonably priced for a lunch combo with more than enough food.  3 of us ordered the lunch special (2 vegetarian, 1 chicken) which were all good, although the heat level was off.  The 2 vegetarians asked for heat level 3 (offered range of 1-10) while the chicken was requested as a 9.  Both came out around a 5. Why bother asking if you're not going to follow through.  Portions were good but oddly served.  Lunch combo includes salad, chutneys, rice, naan, entree, side, and desert.   For our group of 3 we were served 2 bowls of rice and 2 pieces of naan. We didn't run out, so it was ok, but seemed odd when everything else was served in individual dishes.  We had to ask for the salad and chutneys which were forgotten.  Masala Chai tea (which to me is the barometer of quality for any restaurant) was just ok. Too much fennel/anise flavor, and too thick/heavy being made with a lot of whole milk.    I checked in on yelp (which is how I found the place, after my first choice and favorite Udupi turned out to be closed/out of business!).  Yelp specified it was open for lunch, and offered a $15 for $25 coupon, which I purchased.  It wasn't until the end of the meal and attempting to pay that I was rudely told the promo wasn't valid with the lunch special.  I told her that wasn't mentioned in the terms, she made some excuse and wandered off.   I decided I'd just take it up with Yelp later, and put my card in the folio.  Unfortunately she disappeared and after about 10 minutes of waiting I tracked her down in the office behind the hostess stand, knocking on the door and interrupting her personal phone call.  At that point I was getting upset. with the service and called her out on the yelp promo, insisting that the only restrictions are that it's not valid for takeout or on Fridays/Saturdays. She disagreed but finally said she'd honor it and wrote down the promo code and adjusted my bill.  Overall the food was good but service was unacceptable. Portions and prices if ordering the lunch combo were reasonable but ala-carte and dinner menu pricing were excessive and the portions are probably the same judging by other reviews.  I would not return given the variety of other Indian options in the area."}
{"text":"Food was great. I got the paneer and my boyfriend got the chick pea something-or-other (sorry, I could look it up, but I'm too lazy). The spice levels here are great as well. We both got a 7; definitely enough to make your nose run, but not enough to make the food unbearably hot.  The naan was also fresh and delicious.  I'd definitely go back! Portion sizes are enormous. We had enough for us both to eat a second meal out of it.   Side note: it feels like you're eating in a palace with the silver cups and plates at your table. Ha."}
{"text":"Update to my post. I set the dollar value at $$ but that was with my groupon. The value is a bit higher than that if you have an appetizer, 2 entrees, desert and wine as our Groupin did. Still excellent food"}
{"text":"Our favorite Indian place! Fresh, tasty menu. Service is always wonderful. It's often busy, speaking volumes of the food, so reservations are recommended. Very modern and classy decor. One of our most frequented restaurants - and prior to finding this gem, we rarely dined out on Indian Cuisine."}
{"text":"I invited out of town guests out to dinner. They were not big fans of Indian cuisines so I thought I would take them to a favorite of mine. They were apprehensive at first as we had to wait 30 minutes. I told them it is worth the wait. From the moment we sat down they started to get excited. They warned us that the food takes a little bit to prepare as everything is made from scratch. After a pleasant wait or food was served. They were thrilled and said they have a new found love for the food. For me I know just how good it is at The Dhaba. My joy was sharing such a great meal with my friends and them having that kind of reaction. Still the best in my book."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I feel like this is what Indian dining should be like. The setting and the service are great. And the food!! I feel like this is the best I've come across in Arizona. It might be a little more than other Indian restaurants but I think it's worth it. The food is delicious and I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I have never had Indian food until I visited The Dhaba. The moment I walked in, there was an overwhelming smell of spice. My husband thought it was great. I struggled to breathe. It wasn't a bad smell, it was REALLY strong. I recovered from my asthma attack and was able to take in the whole atmosphere. There was a guy in the corner playing music quietly, and only a few tables in the whole place. We had a reservation, but they were unaware of needing to have a high chair ready so, we had to wait a couple minutes. No big deal. We listened to the guy in the corner and made faces at each other to pass the time with a three year old. While we waited a couple walked in for a table. They were told that without a reservation it would be more than a 30 minute wait. They left. We didnt. We were directed to our table covered with shiny silver tableware except one thing: A plastic cup with Mickey Mouse, specifically for my son to use during his visit (he happens to like the mouse ). We were left to figure out the extensive menu without a clue to start with. And even right after it was ordered, I couldn't tell you what it was. There was vegetarian rice and chicken and lamb. All of it was very flavorful and very spicy! We were asked to rate the heat we wanted. I learned the hard way, 5 is still pretty hot and it is WAY different than Mexican food spice! The food was remarkable. The service is just meh. The price was also what I would consider average. My son only ate the flat bread (naan?), he didn't want to try anything else, but for the three of us it was only around $40. I was so full leaving there with good food sitting in my belly. We will probably go back another time."}
{"text":"Use to be our favorite Indian restaurant, driving out of our way just to dine there . We came on a Sunday at 7:00 p.m., last day of \"Restaurant Week in PHX\" to take advantage of the $40 special. We were greeted and seated right away from a young lady who was the Hostess, Order taker and Drink server.   The young lady finally got around to our table after waiting a bit to take out drink order and menu order. We decided to go with the Restaurant Week PHX $40 which changed when we got there to $44 special. We ordered our whole meal up front 1st. course: Bombay Bhel Puri (crisp puffed rice, onions, potatoes, cilantro), 2nd. course: 2 Kashmiri Chicken Tikka Masala (level of hotness a 6 and an 8), 3rd. course: Kulfi (ice cream made with pistachios, cardamom seeds).  I can honestly say we were very disappointed overall, the wait to take our order was long and the wait to get our drinks (beers) was long. What was not a long wait was to give us our bill which I noted on the Web site for Restaurant week we were to be charged only $40 not $44. The 1st. course we ordered was OK I just think it was personal taste. The 2nd. course which we've had many times had very little chicken, the spice levels we requested were tame (again we frequent here quit a bit, so we know). The Naan was chewy and doughy. To top it off, our dessert was delivered and we were told they ran out so they gave a mango ice cream that I did NOT like, but mean while 2 tables down got the pistachio Ice cream (they arrive well after we did). We were told by the young lady \"well they just pick it out of a container and you get what you get\".  Really? I took note that the young lady was not very friendly, an abrupt manner to everyone, workers and diners. What happen? when the Mother and Father Owners were there the service ran much smoother, food was excellent even for the $$. The food which I raved about was not good, the Naan was horrible and the dessert mess up and at $44 there frankly was no savings cost.  Sorry service OK, wait bad, food OK and for the $ price this is the last time."}
{"text":"After hearing a lot of good reviews about Dhaba, I decided to check this place out. We started with Chicken Tikka as the appetizer. It was very bland and dry with no appreciable amount of spice on it. The platter on which it was brought out was burning the Tikka. The things started getting worse from there.  The sauce with the entree lacked any spice or color. Seemed like tomatoes and some spices were put in a blender, churned and served with peas and paneer. Chicken biryani was nowhere close to a biryani with some generic spices mixed with rice and chicken. And the final nail in the coffin was the exorbitantly priced items. Safe to say, this will be the first and last time, I visit this place."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant in town. This is coming from an Indian.  My go to items: somosa, pani puri, chicken makhani, tandoori chicken, Naan, and chicken biryani."}
{"text":"I do see why this is a five-star yelp restaurant. The quality of the food and service met all my expectations. I also like to think I'm a foodie! I of course tried the chicken tiki masala."}
{"text":"After purchasing a Living Social voucher for The Dhaba, we decided to try it out on a Tuesday evening. To preface, the food was fantastic. I was very impressed. I highly recommend trying one of their entrees prepared in their tandoor oven. The naan bread, both plain and chili infused, was delicious.   However, their service was below average. Granted, they did have a large party dining with them. But there seemed to be only one waitress for the entire dining room. It took about 15 minutes for her to even glance our way and then greet us. Once greeted, she asked if we were ready to order, which of course we were not as we had many questions about the menu. I was given the wrong glass of wine and had to wait even longer for my beverage.   Again, the food was great. And I certainly plan on trying it out again, especially as it's so conveniently located. My recommendation to The Dhaba is to provide the appropriate amount of staff needed to run a successful business, especially when doing a promotional deal for guests, thus increasing traffic."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's different when you eat at this restaurant compared to getting it delivered, but I just did Uber Eats from Dhaba and it was pretty terrible.  The food seemed like it had been sitting since lunch.   Based on the overall 4 star I'm assuming the food needs to be eaten fresh and at the restaurant.  Anyways, I just wanted to warn anyone thinking about getting delivery."}
{"text":"Great Indian food, great ambiance and dining atmosphere. Fast friendly service and average prices. Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Their Naan bread is so good, tastes better than others...we ordered all sorts of stuff and it was all really tasty and yum."}
{"text":"All of the Indian food places I go to are usually the same old same old, and upset my stomach. The Dhaba has extremely tasty food you will not regret, super cute set up, and our waitress was very friendly and recommended my dishes and my beer. She has good taste! I can't wait to go back. My mouth waters every time I think about it. YUMMMM."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant I've tried in the Phoenix area in the year I've been here. Great food, great service, reasonable prices (especially if you Groupon it)."}
{"text":"I LOVE Indian food, so I requested Indian food for my birthday dinner, and the family took me here, even though it was a bit of a drive.   Since we had reservations, my party of four were seated immediately at a table with really cool silverware and plates, plus the best \"goblet\" I've ever drunk water from! As the dinner progressed, Mark H. commented that those goblets didn't sweat. Sure enough, the goblet was keeping my water chilled but wasn't sweating. Cool!   The hostess and waitress were incredibly attentive, and we also had the opportunity to talk with the owners! Take time to read some of the information about how civic-minded these owners are (on the left wall when you walk in). They truly support the local community.   The food? I'm not sure what we ordered, as I let my hubby take care of the ordering (since the national dish where he hails from is Tikki Masala). The food, however, all tasted yummy. You must have the garlic naan though to go with whatever dish you order, and top your meal off with the Chai tea (best ever).   Great place! I'll be back, as I'd like to visit their grocery store next door and experience more of their tasty dishes."}
{"text":"After seeing such great reviews by yelpers, I decided to dine in for dinner. As I entered through the door, I realized I made a mistake. The place was just crowded with Indian handicrafts, which instead of giving an ethnic look seemed to be a misfit. The seating appeared not cozy but just as if u r sitting in a narrow street. I started with an appetizer, the pappri chaat which gave me such a hard time eating it all, that I could not even finish half the plate and decided to leave. Not a good experience. Won't recommend at all."}
{"text":"Went to The Dhaba for the first time during restaurant week so we could try their different entrees.  We had made a reservation and were seated immediately. Service was fantastic! Our server explained in great detail the menu and gave us recommendations based on our tastes. He was extremely helpful. We each started with a glass of house wine and they brought out some Pappadums, which are lightly fried Lentil Wafers. Delicious with the 3 different sauces/chutneys. Followed by the Bombay Bhel Puri. So delicious and light and refreshing. I could've made a meal of it.  Our entrees were the  Kashmir Tika Masala #7 spice level, which was delicious and so authentic. Best we've ever had. We also had the Vegetable Korma, #8 spice level, also delicious. For dessert we both had the Bhadami Khmer which we had never had. It's an Indian rice pudding. Very good and a perfect compliment to our dinner along with a cup of Masala Chai. We will definitely be back and look forward to trying other entrees.  Can't say enough about the great service! Outstanding!!!!"}
{"text":"We have returned to the Dhaba several times since my 1 star review and I'm a bit embarrassed to discover that I have not updated my review until now.  Restaurants can have bad days and after visiting Dhaba on multiple occasions since my last review, I'm convinced I caught them on an \"off night\". food and service in our subsequent visits has brought as back to Dhaba as regular customers and we would recommend this Indian restaurant to anyone looking for a place to call their favorite!  The past several times we've been here, the food has been great and the staff is friendly and helpful.  We love the papadum with the trio of chutneys that are served complimentary while deciding what to order.  The korma is wonderful as are the tandoori and vegetarian dishes we've had.  The Indian spices are spot on and the naan is so good that we always need another order.   We like our food spicy, but for those of you who like a more mild dish, Dhaba will customize your order to please.  Dhaba has become our favorite Indian restaurant in the valley and we dine her regularly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch special. I had the chicken curry. It had good flavor and it was a lot of food for the money. And service was excellent."}
{"text":"Love this place, and I'm here on Valentine's Day with the people I love.  Coincidence?  No, you can thank Groupon and the fact that we didn't get a baby sitter, and, did I mention, my wife also loves this place.  What about grandma you ask?  Does she love this place?  Who knows, she's coming anyway.  The menu now indicates such things as gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan for each item.  That's good because I avoid those categories like cooked carrots and water chestnuts.  Orders are served on an arrangement of copper bowls.  The chicken vindaloo is actually a little spicy. Seating is limited, so a reservation is recommended.  I'll see you at The Dhaba.  I just feel cool saying the name. . . to myself as I finish typing this review."}
{"text":"The best Indian food in Arizona. The owner is one of the finest people you will ever meet in your life. Everything about the place is special. All of the food is fresh and made on premises daily. Treat yourself to something unique."}
{"text":"Outstanding flavor, spicy as a bastard, and good beer and wine. A bit pricey for sure, but worth it occasionally. The adjacent Indian store is cool but even more overpriced."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian food  I love this place. Although they don't have my favorite dish anymore (something like aloo chaat.) but everything here is good and I love the metal dish wear and the decor. It's rather slow and a bit expensive, as are many Indian restaurants, but if you're in the mood for a relaxing evening and great food, give it a try."}
{"text":"Nice smaller restaurant. Good service. Awesome vegetable korma."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the food very much! I would definitely come back and I would say makes it in to my Top 3 Indian restaurants in Phoenix. Definitely high up there in terms of the cute atmosphere. Can't wait to come back and go to the little market next door."}
{"text":"Wow! This has to be the best Indian food we have had in the Phoenix-area for some time. We do not like very spicy food so we were hesitant (have ordered things mild or 1 at other places and still had it be really super hot). However, everything we ordered was spiced just exactly as we like it! The food was all so flavorful and everything seemed very fresh. The meat was of good quality and without gristle or fat. The only downside was the online ordering wasn't working. :( Hopefully they fix it because we want to order from here again!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Have tried every Indian restaurant in Tempe, and the majority of Phoenix not to mention other states. Best Indian cuisine I've ever had. not much else to say, love The Dhaba!"}
{"text":"I am by no means an expert on India cuisine. My experience is limited to dozens of buffets and a single non-buffet experience a friend took me to in Manhattan. While that was good, this was awe-inspiring.  The Dhaba is NOT a buffet restaurant. They serve fresh Punjabi food and have an extensive menu. But not at lunch during the week. Their innovative approach is to rotate through the best items on their menu each week. We ate their on a Thursday. We skipped the two vegetarian entrees and went straight for the chicken and lamb. Both were melt-in-your-mouth outstanding. Both were spiced for flavor, not simply heat. I'm a huge fan of hot food, but it wasn't until driving out of the parking lot that I realized how not-hot the food had been. Amazing.  We had the Mur Lasuni Tikka (chicken) and the Kali Marichi Ka Gosht (lamb). Served family style, with fantastic madras lentils (they probably call it something different), yogurt sauce (taziki?) , naan that perfectly complimented the meal instead of overpowering it, and a lovely salad with a mango-and-lots-of-other-good-stuff dressing.  The lovely lady there took the time to explain everything to us and made the experience that much better. And since they rotate the lunch menu every day during the week -- full menu on the weekends and for dinner -- I have good reason to return at least four more times this month!"}
{"text":"Amazing selection followed by delicious food. Will definitely come back and recommend to others. The service was also helpful and on point. Won't go elsewhere for the authentic atmosphere and taste. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Love the Somosas here! I have tried many from all over and this is the best here in this area! Trust me well worth ever penny and calorie! All things on menu that we have tried have been GREAT! It is a place that for such a tiny place they sure can cook!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. We were there for restaurant week. The food was outstanding as was the service. The staff were very nice and pleasant as well as attentive. I cannot recall the names of the food we ordered but it was the best Indian food I have ever tasted. I highly recommend this place. We will be back.  Don't forget to check out the market that is located to the eastern part of the dining room.    The chai was also very tasty and delicious."}
{"text":"Looking for gluten free restaurants that deliver, found this place on grubhub and they listed gluten free and vegetarian menu items right there in the grubhub app.    I did call ahead to verify a couple items and the gentleman who answered the phone was very nice and informative.   So I ordered the cornmeal rhoti and a chicken meal with jasmine rice.   Food was great if not a bit mild for my taste but great flavor.  The cornmeal rhoti was surprisingly tasty.    My new favorite place when I'm down in this area of Tempe."}
{"text":"My wife and I just had a very enjoyable dining experience @ The Dhaba.  We had the tandoori shrimp to start, and chicken tiki masala as our main dish.  This place will not disappoint. I've eaten Indian food my entire life, at many different places, and I can tell you with confidence that this place is legit.   If you're on the fence about trying it out, give it a go, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit to the restaurant. The food taste good here which is the reason for my 3rd visit. This time we ordered the lunch combo and the food items was predecided by the restaurant.  The lentil soup (daal) which was served to us was stale. I think almost 1-2 day old. On checking with server, they changed the dish to fresh one however manager or server did not really care about the stale food which I already ate. it taste bad, it smells stale.  I wish I don't get into health issue due to this. Warning !!!  Please make sure you smell ur food before you eat here."}
{"text":"We (Husband and I) love The Dhaba. Our first two visits were pretty different from each other, so we waited until our third visit to formulate a solid opinion on the place. It's a very thorough four stars for us!  The food is five-star good. It's that simple.  We love the crisp, cumin-laced poppadums (spelled many ways once translated to English: pappadams, papadums, etc.) they serve while you wait for your order and the choice of three sauces. Husband dips with the chili sauce; I mix the sweet tamarind sauce and the chili sauce.  Their chicken tikka masala contains very tender chicken, and consistently has a nice spice blend, level of cilantro, and velvety texture. We find it sometimes has a little less chicken in it than the chicken makhani (makhani murgh), and Husband isn't a sauce guy, but he orders it every time anyway.  The murgh makhani (often translated as butter chicken) is tied for the best I've ever had. The sauce is a rich, as the name would suggest, blend of butter, pureed tomato, and cream, and it is studded with plump golden sultanas (NOT RAISINS, GUYS--these are not hard, chewy blobs) and cashews. The chicken has its trademark bright red skin and is so, so, so tender. Seriously. So tender.  Their mango lassis are the best I've ever had, and I've had Indian all over the place--NYC, London... they are thick, fruity, and perfectly sweet, which means not overly sweet, not under-sweetened.  The garlic naan is superb; we always order two. They use real minced garlic and it is always a nice balance of crisp and tender. No gummy naan at The Dhaba.  Great gulab jamun, but like most Indian places, they cost quite a bit.  The service is where I quibble--the staff are super nice, and super personable. The kitchen just seems to be slow. Our first visit, we waited a longish time, but not so much that we noticed anything out of the ordinary. On our second visit, we waited a full fifty minutes from the time we ordered to the time we received any food--naan included. It all came out together fifty minutes after we ordered it. Eek. There were only a few other patrons in the restaurant at the time, too. The food was still blow-our-minds good, so we decided to give them one more chance, and we're glad we did, because the wait was very reasonable our third time, and the staff especially attentive. (AND they brought the naan out for us to graze on while we waited--perfect.)  In short--eat at The Dhaba. The food is outstanding, the wait time is tolerable, and the staff are kind."}
{"text":"Food here is delicious, vegan friendly, and service is always fantastic. If you don't know what to order, the servers are helpful and will walk you through the menu."}
{"text":"16 dollars for these? Tastes kinda like the curry that you can have in Thai restaurant and it only cost you around 10 dollars.  Definitely not worth the money. Won't go back again"}
{"text":"This place was right near an old apartment of mine. The food is authentic and delicious. Customer service 10/10. Had barely no wait time. Water was kept full and waitress was very attentive. Next time I get my Indian food crave on, I know where I am going!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in the valley.  Their curries are very flavorful and spicy.  I usually get their Vindaloo, although I've had the Dhaba curry, and a couple others (both lamb and chicken).  The Naan is great, and we've been given a couple desserts on the house that were fun and interesting.  They do a good job of trying to find some stuff for our kids to eat, but we usually just bring something along for them to have with basmati rice.  My wife gets their Chiken Tikka Masala, and she loves it.  We often go here for lunch, which is not a buffet (which we prefer)."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! It is really good quality but a little on the pricey side for Indian food. The staff there is great and really accommodating as well. Definitely can't wait to visit here again!"}
{"text":"Eating at The Dhaba was my first Indian food experience, and I will say I was pleasantly surprised. I tried their chicken tikka masala, the chicken curry, the biryani and some tandoori chicken. I ordered spice level 5. It was perfect, not too hot but enough to leave a slight burn on my tastebuds. The tikka masala tastes like a buttery, creamy tomato soup. The chicken curry was perfectly done, the chicken falling apart and moist. The naan tasted fresh baked and you could taste the salt and garlic on the garlic naan. It was so good, the naan was probably the best part. I also got a dish of some yogurt sauce which was nice and cooled down some of the heat, and a bowl of lentils to dip stuff in and it was very tasty too. We also got a thin, papery tortilla type bread with some little cups of sauces to dip it in, sort of like an indian tortilla, and this was a very nice touch and very authentic as I've never had anything like it. The biryani was a large helping and I kept find myself wanting to take more bites even as I became more and more full, it was just very flavorful and the foreign tastes to it was very pleasant. If there was anything that was something I could complain about, it was the chicken tandoori, which was hunks of chicken breast with a yogurt and spice dressing, but really it was just a dry sort of chicken breast with some spicy flavoring. Still, it was cooked through if not a little dry, but I get the impression there is supposed to be something more to it than just cooked sliced chicken breast with some marinade. The server was nice, prompt with drinks, and because the restaurant was very small we got consistent attention and it was not hard to ask a passing server for a drink refill or more rice. The basmati rice was also very flavorful and helped offset some of the heat from the sauces. We also got the rice pudding dessert which tasted very much like rice pudding, but I am also not a big rice pudding fan or a dessert person. Overall, I enjoyed it so much the next day I was craving it! It really was that good. It is not in the best location ever and the building is a little drab, but otherwise really worth going. To the people saying this place does not have good indian food, well, I am not an expert in Indian food, but I will say I tried another Indian place near me a few days later because I really wanted some yummy chicken masala but didnt want to drive to tempe and guess what, it really was not anywhere near The Dhaba. If you get a chance to go I would recommend it. Others are saying it was very expensive? But, compared to other places I really don't think it is. You can easily spend anywhere from 10 and up a person at most mainstream restaurants, and this place was no different but the food sure did taste great.   Tip: go early because as other reviewers have said if you show up late they will turn you down, they close promptly at 9:00pm and finish seating earlier than that."}
{"text":"This was delish! And I love that they had clear marking on what was vegan on the menu. We asked for 7 out of 10 spicy, and it was still pretty mild for me. The cauliflower had the most kick, but not overwhelming. Next time I will try 9 or 10. And there will definitely be a next time!"}
{"text":"The food is not worth the price. They use a lot of food Colors to make the food look spicy. The chicken did taste fresh. We ordered a total of 8dishes and the only saving grace was their lamb seekh kebab. I wouldn't go back to this place."}
{"text":"We came with a large group and service was sloooow. The highlight for me was definitely the vegetarian appetizer plate - an assortment of flavorful fried bites that were worth coming back for!  Dinner course was just okay - It seemed like almost everyone at the table felt that their dishes were mostly sauce with very little \"stuff\" in them. Kind of made us feel like we weren't getting much for our money. Also, \"medium\" spicy was not spicy at all.  Very nice atmosphere and decor."}
{"text":"Food was good but, spice level was not consistent with previous visits ( much spicier last night) Service was OK, but I felt we were being rushed, the wait staff told us at 9pm that the kitchen was closing and they seemed a bit too eager to take our plates away (I was still eating!) Sadly the management's inability (reluctance?) to honor the remaining balance on our Dhaba gift card left a sour taste at the end of the evening. Their excuse was that their machine wasn't working although they were able confirm that we had a balance of $5.68, but told us we would need to come back some other time and use it.  Hopefully it will be better in 2016."}
{"text":"1. The Dhaba cooking school is a lot of fun and you learn so much about Indian Cuisine. The Instructor is great, and it is very hands on. We even made Paneer!  2. The restaurant itself is very good, a lot of great aromas, spices and flavors and one of the better Indian Restaurants in the greater Phoenix Area."}
{"text":"Excellent Food, Great Service, Nice Ambience, Modest Price.  Had Dinner multiple times - will recommend Chicken Curry and Chicken Biryani.  Naan can be a bit softer and serving a bit larger for dinner.  Overall I would highly recommend the place. Easy access from Metro Line  Would like to see fresh juices on the Menu - Fresh"}
{"text":"3rd time here and still just as good. Love this place. Food : awesome You also get to pick your spice level! Ok for all types of eaters. If you want to try curry but don't want the spice this is the place to check out."}
{"text":"Wanted to try authentic Indian food for a while and finally had the opportunity to check it out with some friends (the hubby is not as adventurous when it comes to food). I chose this place for the location and the yelp ratings and reviews.   I made 5pm reservations using open table which was simple and easy. When we showed up however, it took several minutes before we were greeted and shown our table. There were only two other tables occupied at the time so they were not busy at all. The host/server was nice though. The decor was tastefully done and the table settings and silver dishes gave the place a high class touch. It was also very clean.  For our first time, the menu was overwhelming. I've heard of a few dishes such as tikki masala and butter chicken. So we decided to order that plus two others that we weren't as familiar with.  I chose an appetizer that was described as a little bit of everything.  So I assumed it would be a platter type item so everyone could share, grab with their fingers and taste. When we received our appetizer it was not what I expected. Literally,  almost everything listed on the appetizer section was included in this dish covered with a yogurt type sauce sitting in a edible crispy shell. We asked how we were to go about eating it. The server told us to grab the spoon and break it off in pieces since each section held a different treat. So we did.  It was different but tasty. Would I order it again?  Probably not.  Our main dish was very spicy but that was to be expected. I had just enough rice to curry ratio to finish my meal. But my favorite part of the meal was the garlic naan. I loved it! I'd eat that all day. Also, if you check in through yelp you receive a free house dessert which was a rice pudding. I'm usually not a fan of rice puddings but it really helped balance out all the spices I just ate. So I basically gobbled that up.  The reason I'm only giving 3 stars was because we were not able to use our Groupon. After reading other yelp reviews, I noticed many referring to the special on Groupon which was to purchase $16 for $30 worth of food.  I bought the Groupon today to use today. But the server told us we were not able to use it because we have to wait 24 hours before use otherwise the system would not accept it. Then she said to come back and use it at a later time. There was nothing specific in the fine print about not being able to use in the same day.  Well I will not be back and hopefully I will be able to get a refund from Groupon.   Overall, the food was okay. It's just not my preference. But I plan on trying other places closer to where I live.  Maybe I just have to find the right dish."}
{"text":"AMAZING every time I go they impress me. The food is incredible and the service is spot on."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the state. Been to every \"taste of India\" you can imagine and this place takes the crown. Amazing vegetarian options, craft beers and wines. Service isn't the best but you won't have to worry, the food will make up for anything. The owner is super friendly and will make sure your enjoying everything. The nann is some of the best I've ever had. Get the korma or the tiki masala. Love this place and the market has some really cool stuff."}
{"text":"Great authentic Indian food and excellent service.  We made a reservation here for New Years Eve based on the good reviews and close proximity to where we were vacationing.  We had multiple servers including the owner, making sure our drink glasses stayed full throughout our dinner.  Everyone was friendly and engaging.  The garlic naan and palak paneer were flavorful and the palak had a nice amount of hot spice.  We received a free dessert for our Yelp check in as well, which was a nice treat.  The owner here really seemed to take pride in providing a great dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is consistently good!!!  The lamb korma is excellent, creamy with pine nuts you can actually taste and the lamb is not fatty. Tandoori dishes always smell amazing, I keep meaning to try them, but get distracted by the curries because they are so good. The naan is ok, I always get Paratha because I like it better. The service is a little slow, but the food is worth it. Also, they have street treats on the menu that always make me want to drool, but they are never available when we are there :("}
{"text":"Delicious lunch today at The Dhaba Favorites were: Pindi Chole (fried bread and curried chickpeas), Sharabi Kababi Gosht (lamb with spinach, ginger, garlic and spices) and Machi Masaledar (aka Fish Vindaloo, hot hot hot!)."}
{"text":"Do not use their delivery service! We ordered our food and it took almost two hours to deliver it. I called the restaurant and apparently the driver was looking for the house. Okay. Maybe he should be calling me then instead of the other way around. I always use app delivery services but this time I just went with yelp. In the future I will know better.  No surprise the food was cold. Ugh."}
{"text":"Delicious. We ordered the chicken tikka masala and the butter chicken and both were great, We actually went back again two days later."}
{"text":"The food and ambiance both are very good. The food was very tasty. The 5 stars are only for food. For cost it would be 3.5 stars. It seems to be little more costly as compared to other Indian restaurant in Phoenix/Tempe/Chandler area.  For ex: Veg Thali was around $17+tax which only includes 2 curry, 1 daal, 1 naan, rice, small portion of desert with Masala Tea. This is not enough for the price which has been asked.  I had Thali in other indian restaurant but they provided more items in less price.  Hoping that they will add more items in Thali which can justifies it's price."}
{"text":"I came here on a date, having read good reviews and knowing friends who like it here... and I was less than impressed.  First off, I made reservations, and we still had to wait. We were right on time, there were empty tables, and I was a little confused. After being sat by our wholly unenthusiastic hostess-slash-waitress, we waited FOREVER to get in our drink order. We perused the huge menu for quite some time, thought about getting an appetizer, but ended up skipping the app because we figured we would be there all night long if we did. (in retrospect, a smart move.)  When the food came, it was pretty good, but a little bland. I'd maybe try different dishes if there's a next time. I could see people complaining that the portions are on the smaller side, but I thought they were OK. Not great, but okay.   Minus a star for the fact that our wine never came until our food showed up, and I had to politely remind our server. Being on a date, this really was killer. Would have been nice to loosen up convo with a nice glass of wine, and we ended up both getting one glass instead of two.   All in all, super disappointing. Thought it was going to be a fun, interesting experience, and looked forward to doing something different. But this place is firmly OUT of my \"dating restaurants\" rotation. Maybe I'll come back with friends? If we had a super nice waitress who suggested dishes and treated us well, it could have been great. (and, it doesn't have a very romantic ambiance... we were so far apart when sitting at our \"table for 2\" that we joked about having convo via carrier pigeon.)   Factor in the fact that it's kind of expensive, and yeah... 2 stars all the way."}
{"text":"Tastiest Indian food we've had! Soooooo good. So so good. The vegetarian options are great, a nice place where carnivores & herbivores can enjoy their dining experiences together.   Check in on Yelp for your free dessert!"}
{"text":"Very good Indian food, this is first place I experienced Indian,  and I have been hooked ever since. This is my go to spot for Chicken Tikka Masala....it's super flavorful and is always good.  I do wish they gave more chicken in the dish,  but it's a good because i usually use the remaining curry for my Basmati rice..mmmm.  The service is fast! I call in my orders and I never have to wait, which is a plus.  My addiction  for Indian curry is quite abnormal...lol, but nonetheless,  i can always count on getting a great meal here."}
{"text":"Excellent food coupled with simple and refreshing setup. There is a sense of rusticness about the place and it tries to bring out the dhaba feel. Malai kofta and dhal were fresh and tasty. Many Indian restaurants service mild food inspite of requests for Indian spicy but this was spot on. Not the typical paprika spicy but the strength of masala was good."}
{"text":"So GOOD.  It's beautiful inside, the service is very nice, and the FOOD is truly wonderful.  I reccomend...everything. A word of warning though.  Do NOT mess around when they ask how spicy you would like it.  They are not screwing around.  I'm normally a 8 or 9 kind of guy, but here I won't creep past a 6. Ever. Your mouth will hate you, and your butt won't have anything nice to say to you for days if you go higher than 7."}
{"text":"They've got an enormous menu with choices for everyone. We ordered mild and got some pretty well-spiced dished. Delish, and with great intensity.  We felt it was a bit pricey for lunch, and they sadly do not have a kid's menu, but the food and service were very good - some highlights...  Nan - perfectly cooked with great char Chicken Tika Masala - excellent complex flavors (our favorite of the meal) Lamb Curry - ordered medium, which means spicy, but very tasty Okra - dry fried with perfectly camamelized onions  They also have an Indian grocery and shop next door, and extra parking in the back too."}
{"text":"First time customer and food is good, not the best.   Cute atmosphere located within an all Indian plaza, we ordered the chicken tikka masala, dal, aloo gobi (cauliflower potato), naan, rice, and samosa for starters.    Chicken tikka was delicious though very  few chunks of chicken - maybe it comes that way or maybe that's why they wanted to know from the get go we had living social voucher.   Aloo gobi and dal were bland no taste.   Everything's else was good.   Service though not prompt was very friendly.   I would go back again to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Wonderful.  Service was only topped by the food.  Seasoned and spiced just right.  We were very happy and would definitely come again.  Attached is a store that we were able.to get spices.that we have been look for long a long time and couldnt find anywhere else."}
{"text":"Authentic Punjabi food and great service. The spice level is a bit toned down - I ordered a 10 (highest) and got what I would call medium hot. But they got me a bowl of green chillies so it was all good. Try this place for sure.  BTW - I ordered the non-veg thali I'm modifying the review because the last time I was here the food sucked.  The service was still great and they switched out a dish for us but the overall food quality was lacking.  I'm guessing only the Thalis here are good as a person in our group ordered one of those and it was good"}
{"text":"The whole dining experience from the time we walked in to the time we waddled out was FCUing amazing. Sometimes everything works out just right and this was one of those times. The menu is complex and is probably a little daunting if you have not eaten in an Indian restaurant before. If this is your first trip to an Indian restaurant have the waiter or waitress suggest a few dishes for you. We ordered an almost all-meat appetizer that included chicken, shrimp and some peppers and onions. It was a perfect start to a great meal. We paired this with a lovely bottle of Pinot noir that was really smooth and light. We followed this with a mango chicken, goat curry, a spinach dish, garlic naan, basmati rice and raita. The three main dishes complemented each other perfectly. We only ordered the curry at a level six hotness and we could probably have gone to an eight. The owner came out and asked us how everything was and we had a very pleasant chat with him. We were the last people left in the restaurant as it was after 9 pm when we were finishing out chai tea and complimentary rice pudding and doughnuts.  One of the best Indian meals I have eaten and definitely a place I will return to."}
{"text":"Wow! What an excellent and well seasoned meal! The flavors of everything served was delectable! And service was speedy.   I ordered the eggplant and was incredibly satisfied, though know that even a 4 on their spicy scale has some heat! Not overwhelming, but it definitely made my nose run and left my mouth sizzling with heat. People in my party ordered the lamb curry & chicken tiki masala, all dishes were fantastic.   Don't forget to check in on yelp for the free dessert, definitely refreshing after the heat of the Indian spices! Yum!"}
{"text":"Disgustingly, disturbingly, delusionally delicious. I'm not an expert in Indian cuisine. More of a point-to-a-random-dish-and-hope-I-like-it type of dude. So I can't measure this up against Indian places in London, or go into detail about its authenticity. I have no standing to be a pretentious prick here.  But where my expertise in Indian cuisine is limited, my experience in eating is very well developed. I have been practicing the appreciation of eating for nearly 27 years. I devote hours every day to food. I practice three times a day minimum. I am a disciplined eater. At times I eat four, five, even six times a day. My dedication is unsurpassed. Sometimes I punish my body to the point where I am nearly puking, because I want to be the best. I am driven, focused, a real go-getter. If eating was a profession, I would have a Ph.D. If the moon was actually made of cheese, I would be Elon Musk, and I would eat that shit. Ocean tides are overrated, give me that moon cheese. Point is, I'm good at eating. Respect my authority.  And what does this authority say about The Dhaba? It's fucking delicious. It's a tongue tickler. A mouth party. I am actually drooling writing this, just giant slobbery drips of saliva pouring out of my slackened jaw like a hungry, retarded St. Bernard. That is the effect The Dhaba will have on you. The faint memory of it will conjure up a memories and feelings from somewhere deep and ancient in the brain, from the lizard parts that mix and mingle food pleasure with other primal urges.  What I'm saying is that thinking of The Dhaba's food makes me want to take it from behind and have my way with it.  I don't think I can be more clear. Go have a foodgasm while it's still legal."}
{"text":"Overrated place. Great for Americans. It of you want real quality Indian food there is better to be had in Tempe. Nice atmosphere here but it's definitely in a bad neighborhood.  The bottom line was this place could be a bit closer to 4 stars if it were not for the super tiny portion size. They are really trying to keep people on a diet in this place.   It's no Kebab or India Gate in the quality dept IMO."}
{"text":"Amazing food . Beautiful decor . A bit expensive. Otherwise a 5 star place. Its not the most authentic food but it was good nevertheless."}
{"text":"The place used to be good, but not any more. They have settled for mediocre taste & customer service like any other Indian restaurant in the valley. Don't expect a miracle, but if you are hungry and want to grab some spice after a Sun Devils game, then not a bad choice. Better than other Indian shops in that area."}
{"text":"Came here for a valentine's dinner with the hubby. Small space but the food's flavor makes up for it immensely. We ordered the Kolkata pani puri for starters. Little hollowed out puffed pastries stuffed with potatoes and chick peas, which you pour tamarind flavored water on. Although the flavors were there, they didn't work well together.   For the main course we got the Dhaba chicken curry with aromatic basmati rice and some garlic naan. This dish was delicious. The chicken was boneless and tender, the curry was rich with spices and heat. The garlic naan was fresh and pillowy and worked great with the curry. The serving size was perfect for two to share, and we even had enough to take home!  Great atmosphere, they even had a guy playing a sitar in the front of the restaurant! This restaurant is located in the India Plaza, next to a Indian grocery store, parking seems really scarce though, and make sure you make a reservation, they get booked!"}
{"text":"Really sad ! We drove 30 minutes to come to this place,they turned us back saying they didn't allow 'service animals'.We had all documents and paper work but they said,their customers didn't like pets in restaurants.Tried explaining there was a difference between pets and service animals,service animals were trained to sit down and behave.I asked for the manager,at whixh the staff said he wasn't present,I asked if I could talk to him on the phone,they gave me his visiting card.Freezing weather with two little kids,and we were asked to leave.Really sad !"}
{"text":"Worst Indian food I ever had today at this the dhaba. Nothing was authentic Punjabi food atleast the food taste was definitely not close to it. Waste of money and time."}
{"text":"I love all the vegan options they had. Great small atmosphere, make sure you get a reservation!  The food was really spicy, I'm on an all plant base diet and don't usually eat such prepared foods without getting sick.   As spicy as it was, my stomach is only warm, not bad at all. I took home the leftovers and can't wait to eat them tomorrow!"}
{"text":"So good! Had the special salad with corn cilantro tomato onion and rice crisps, the chicken curry and garlic naan. So fire trucking good!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! For appetizers, I have tried the samosa plate and samosa chaat! For entrees, I tried the murgh (chicken) biryani and the boneless chicken tandoori (marinated in yogurt & spices). For dessert, we tried the gulab jamun (pardon the spelling errors).   Now, why the 3 stars? The prices, and sometimes skimping on ingredients...ufff my chicken tandoori dish is described to come with a bed of onions and green/bell peppers! There were no peppers!!! There were 1-2 pieces that are too small to be noticed! I told the lady and she ended up bringing me a side of green peppers! Ok!  Whatever!!! But you know why that's a problem??? The dish is $15, and it came only with like 6 chicken pieces, all onions (no peppers, originally...see above), and no naan or rice! I spent another $3 on the naan, and I ended up ordering the small dish of yogurt (raita) to make the meal less dry! You know how much that yogurt was?? $4. So I spent $22 on my 6 pieces of chicken meal and the naan and yogurt!!  Gee thanks guys!! You guys could keep that tandoori to yourself! Next time I'll order a biryani for $14 and have enough food for 2-3 meals!! (It comes with complimentary raita too.. Now that's a deal)"}
{"text":"After seeing this place featured on \"Check, Please!\" we decided to try it.  I'm not a big fan of Indian food in general, but I was excited to try something different.  We ended up with some combo platters and I loved everything, especially the lamb and chicken curry.  Will definitely go back to try other things!"}
{"text":"this is my favorite indian place. make sure you are not in a rush. let the environment draw you in. smell the frangrance of spices emnating from the food ordered by others. yiu can pair your food with the wines offered. ask for help. take your time savoring the food."}
{"text":"I order Maharaja thalie and paid 22$  Don't worth for what u pay They are happy with those customers who has no idea about Indian food vs value.....maharaja dish qixh is highest pruce diah in pre aet manu diah with rice pudding as a desert.... I don't go back to this place...."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Recommend doing reservations on the weekends. It's a tiny little place and fills up fast. If you do have to wait for a table, venture next store to their market! So many great things. Exploring around is a great time killer. Tons of spices, incense, wall hangings, plethorae of Buddha decorative items, etc.   Back to restaurant... I'm a newbie to indian food, so I won't go into detail regarding what we ordered. We went off the recommendations of our server. The food was to die for. The naan bread made with pistachios and other yummy items is to die for!! We all ordered our spice level at 3 - on a scale of 1-10. 3 was almost way too hot. If you're not a fan of spice/heat be weary. I'll I'll probably do a 1 next time as I'm not a fan of burning my face off.   Nice little bonus, if you check in on Yelp you will receive a free rice pudding dessert. It's pretty darn yummy with spices and a fruit swirl on top.   It's not cheap to eat here, however it's worth every single penny! If you sign up to their mailing list they often send out BOGO offers on entrees! :) Give it a try! If you're a newbie like us, don't be intimidated. They are all very sweet and helpful.   The serves wasn't the BEST but there happened to be 2 large parties of 8 people each. So we cut them some slack ;)"}
{"text":"The customer service was amazing. We arrived for lunch just before closing and they let us in anyways. Due to a inadvertent miscommunication, our order was spicier than expected for me. By the time I realized it, the kitchen had left. The staff went out of their way to find something to accommodate us (which was very tasty). The whole thing was handled in a very professional and kind way. I left happy and full. My husband enjoyed the shrimp tikki masala and the palak  panner very much. Great garlic naan! We were so pleased !"}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon to The Dhaba, and my fiance and I used it a few weeks ago.  It was really nice.  I liked the decor.  The place is a bit smaller than I expected, but very cute.    I had the chicken tikka masala and it was excellent.  Spiced just right for me.  I asked for it at a 5.  My fiance had sag lamb, and he liked his as well.  I had garlic naan.  It was a little dryer than I like, but still pretty good.  We went next door to the shop and it was pretty cool to look around.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent, EXCELLENT!  I was here for my first time last night with some friends for dinner and we were all very satisfied.   Wondeful service and a great selection to choose from. I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The best Indian food I've had in Scottsdale/Tempe! I recommend starting with the Gobi Pakore if you're a cauliflower fan like myself, it was perfectly savory. I'm a huge lover of their kashmiri chicken tikka masala; it's mouthwatering delicious. As far as the naan goes, the garlic naan wins my vote hands down. This is the best naan I've ever had; it's fluffy yet thin in true naan style. I can't even describe how perfect it is! I still have so much to try on this menu, I can't wait to head back!   The presentation of their food is very exciting, it's unlike other Indian cuisines I've tried before. Their staff is also very welcoming! Must try."}
{"text":"I had a higher expectations considering the reviews. The place is quite packed up during weekend dinner hours with a good amount of people. We had ordered kebab platter but was told to replace tandoori chicken with chicken tikka which we readily agreed. The kebabs come on a sizzler which keeps it hot. We all friends are quite used to spicy food but it was quite bland as per our taste buds. Next we had goobhi fry which crispy and good. For main course we ordered dhaba korma chicken, paneer, kasmiri naan, chili naan and garlic naan. Kashmiri naan and garlic are good, chilli does not a distinct chilli taste. Desert was Ric's pudding thanks to yelp! I would prefer a more spicy food though."}
{"text":"Excellent service, nice venue, delicious food. Only thumbs down was that each entree we ordered had only a few cubes of meet each. We used a groupon so not sure if that had anything to do with it. But other than that, pretty good food."}
{"text":"The Dhaba is our go to restaurant for Indian food in the Phoenix area. I have an affinity for lamb vindaloo and the Dhaba never disappoints. The lamb is always fork tender (other Indian restaurants have a tendency to serve tough or chewy lamb) and the fiery vindaloo never fails to satisfy my craving for spicy food. We've also tried their chicken curry, korma, tikka masala, aloo palak, palak paneer, naan (garlic and plain), and various deserts. The meats are always cooked perfectly and the flavors of the sauces (spicy or not) are fantastic. Their wine list is decent, and pairing suggestions are offered. The selection of Indian beers is good, and an Indian beer is a fantastic way to subdue the fire on your palate from spicy Indian food. We never leave the Dhaba disappointed. The service is friendly. If you have questions about flavors or spice, just ask and they will take the time to help you through the menu. We have recommended the Dhaba to many people and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Ok first off I was debating to give this place 5 stars because my chicken tikka was so spicy but I remember I didn't ask for it mild next time I will now beyond my mouth burning the food was excellent and service was top notch."}
{"text":"After searching the entire valley for quality indian food, we finally found The Dhaba. It's a very authentic restaurant, market & clothing store which carries everything you could ever want from India, I even went home with some henna & bindis. At the restaurant, we happened to have a living social coupon so we made reservations & glad we did because we arrived at 5:30 on a Wednesday night, & by 6pm the restaurant was already at max capacity. I strongly recommend reservations because the restaurant itself is quaint and cozy. The interior was warm & inviting & the serving dishes/utensils added a nice touch to the experience. All of the art was culturally themed, & I enjoyed myself just looking around. The jolly rickshaws by the front door are especially charming.  We ordered the garlic naan, which was incredibly tasty, warm & fresh! I couldn't get enough of it! I ordered the Korma Chicken (spice level 8) and it was cooked to perfection! My rice was also perfectly cooked & my boyfriend cleaned his plate which had been the chicken tikka masala. Everything is spiced perfectly, & since I LOVE very spicy food, I asked for an 8 on their 1-10 spicy scale. I could have gotten it hotter, but being that this was my first visit I played it safe. If you are not very tolerant of spiciness, then I recommend a 1-3. My boyfriend enjoyed his masala at a 6. The food was absolutely wonderful! Portion sizes are just right and the pricing is to be expected with such high quality ingredients.  Out service was a tad slow, but since we saw with our own eyes just how quickly this place fills up, I'll cut her a break. They do put a lot of effort into making you feel welcomed, even down to the place settings. All of the extra details take some time, but if you're in a hurry, just order take out! Which seemed to be very popular as well! There were at least 6 to-go orders fulfilled just while we were there.  If you enjoy Indian food, come to the Dhaba. If you are vegetarian, come to the Dhaba. If you love spicy food, come to the Dhaba!"}
{"text":"I have not been to many Indian restaurants but I am very happy I tried The Dhaba!  They have coupons on restaurant.com btw, be sure to log in and buy one, it's a great deal!   The table was set beautifully with traditional plates and glasses, I really liked that.  It takes a while for the food to come out so be sure to order appetizers and place your meal order at the same time.  The menu can be a bit shocking to take it all in at once, I did my homework and viewed it online before we went so I could figure out what I wanted.  The naan was so delicious, go for the garlic naan."}
{"text":"Aloo Gobi (cauliflower and potatoes) and Chkn Tikka Masala were excellent, did not care for the Lamb Vindaloo. The menu is loaded with Gluten Free items."}
{"text":"I had an amazing lunch here!  I was craving some ethnic food and Indian always does the trick... If it's good... and I've lived in Phoenix for 10 years and have not until recently had very good luck finding a satisfying fix for my Indian cravings.  I got the Chicken Tikka Marsala, which is a Wednesday lunch special and it was exactly what I was craving.  It came with rice, Naan (I upgraded to garlic) and side salad and a side, I got the yogurt over the lentils.   The Chicken Tikka was perfect, the tandoori chicken was tender, the sauce robust and thick but not greasy. I asked for mine as a level 5 (they ask 1-10) for spiciness and it had some kick but was a perfect heat for me. The rice white is a white/brown combo was moist and the perfect compliment.    The little side salad was nothing special, a little iceberg and some chopped carrots but the dressing was really a standout. I asked what it was and they said it was \"house made\" with mango, mustard, and spices. This dressing has a kick and dressed up (pun intended) the boring little salad.   The yogurt sauce I ordered because it came with the meal, but I ended up eating the whole thing and mixing some with the Marsala.  It's was very very good.   Naan, awesome awesome too.   I will definitely go back for lunch here again and maybe dinner (it's close to work but far from home). The service was very very prompt and there aren't many tables and they weren't slammed for lunch but they were steady so there might be a wait, I would imagine dinner may be busier than lunchtime here.  Perfect portion and cost for a good lunch at $16."}
{"text":"Well the owners are from Kashmir and they do tend to lean towards putting some mighty strong chili powder in their dishes if  you dare to venture into the 9-10 spiciness levels ( you have been warned). The positive review is mainly for the adjustments that they make with nary a whimper especially when the salt or spice mix levels do not agree to my crazy standards."}
{"text":"Good food! We ordered Achari Murgh and Dal Makhani.. Very Overpriced !!"}
{"text":"I think maybe the BF and I are cursed.... I believe that this restaurant is awesome, but we just came at the wrong day and time. We went here tonight with a deal chicken deal that was like 44$ for 92$ worth of food that included: four beers/glasses of wine, two apps, two mains, two sides, two desserts, and two chai teas. Well... the place was overrun by a table of about 20... so the service was slow and they ran out of chai, only having enough to give us like half of one glass. Also, they only brought us each one drink.... so I felt like that was kind of lame, especially considering we had to pay tax and 18% tip on '92$' worth of food, when we really got maybe 65$ worth of food.... pretty lame.   Other than that, the place was good. We got the fried paneer, which I actually wasn't a huge fan of... kind of bland, but then I've never had paneer, so that may just be what it tastes like. The app with the fluffy bread and chickpea curry was really good. The bread was almost like a savory donut or something.... yum. For mains we got chicken tikka masala and  lamb korma. I usually love the CTM, but I think the pieces of chicken were too big, which made them kind of dry and not as flavorful as it could be. The lamb korma, however, was wonderful! The meat was super tender and the curry was great. They also had good basmati rice and garlic naan. For dessert I got their 'ice cream' which is more ice -y than creamy... almost like frozen rice or something... but it was very good. The BF got the rice pudding and enjoyed it. We also enjoyed the chai (what we got of it anyway....). So I would probably return and eat way less food.... but maybe I'll be more picky when it comes to using deals at this place, as it didn't really turn out to be a deal at all."}
{"text":"*Update* I received a lovely response from the owner regarding the Groupon. That's the first time any owner has responded to one of my reviews and it's refreshing. They deserve a 4 star rating for that!  Let me preface this review by saying this was my first time trying Indian food and I just don't care for most of the flavors involved so this is going to be less about food than the experience.  I met a few friends here for dinner tonight. The staff is very friendly. Nice ambiance and the table comes prepared for you with water and their flat bread with sauces and that's a plus. I will say after reviewing the menu it's rather pricey.  My friend ordered the appetizer combo plate and it turned out its literally a dish that just combines everything into one plate. Interesting but not bad. I ordered a vegetarian rice dish as I'm not a meat eater, with peas, tomatoes, onions, and Indian cheese. It was fairly basic and bland and although you get a healthy portion it seems pricey for what it is at $11. I sampled a bit of everyone's dishes and (again my tastebuds) it wasn't really my thing.  I ordered the chilli naan bread and I will say that was amazing! I could eat a stack of that alone.  Me and a friend purchased a Groupon that day to use... $16 for $30...great deal! But they wouldn't let us use them because we bought them the same day. I read all the fine print and nowhere does it mention this so that was irritating. I am getting my money back for the Groupon as I don't think it's a place I'll go back to.   I want to be clear that I think this place is a great representation of fine Indian cuisine;  I'm just not a curry fan, etc so if you're an Indian food lover please try this place. Lovely ambiance and staff! Just keep in mind about the Groupon."}
{"text":"This place has great food and great service.  I've visited a couple times now and tell everyone who likes Indian food to try it out and no one has been disappointed.  I'm not a huge spicy fan so I was bit apprehensive on our first visit.  Needless to say, it was fantastic and beat my expectations.   The only negative thing I saw was the restaurant is not very big so sometimes the wait is very long but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that I had stopped going out to eat at North Indian restaurants in the Phoenix area for a while, since I could not find one that satisfied me. Having been born and brought up in India, I always compared them to what the real thing is supposed to taste like and none met my liking. I tried the Dhaba, a little while ago and was very pleasantly surprised by the taste and quality. The food was quite authentic and I visit there frequently. I have tried quite a few things on the menu and the chicken and mutton selections are very good. But the winner is (....insert drum roll here....)  the maa ki daal (black daal). It truly reminded me of home.  The Phoenix area has quite a few indian restaurants but none that I would re-visit. Now I have finally found one that has good Punjabi food. BTW, the Chaat cafe next door is pretty good too. When I don't feel like a regular meal and am craving some good \"street\"  food, this is my choice. Hope this place stays around, so I can have a place to satisfy my Indian food cravings."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner after a long conference day and was super impressed. I love their plates and drinking glasses made of pewter. They are gorgeous!   However, what impressed me most was their food, obviously. The korma sauce is the best I have had hands down. Take that other Indian restaurants!  It has a delicious nutty flavor and very rich. I had the lamb korma and left the Dhaba a very happy camper.  A Yelp check-in gets you free dessert. Score!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night with recommendations from a few Indian friends. I was very disappointed with the vegetarian selection. Of the \"traditional\" indian drink selection; they were completely out of all the drinks. I asked for my curry \"hot, really hot and spicy.\" It was not. We had a group of 5 and half of our table had to wait for silverware after their food arrive. Then it took them about 35 minutes to bring us our check, nor did we get any water refills, all night. It was a bad time all round."}
{"text":"Visited this place along with Family. The quality & taste of food is good (Can be better).  We ordered vegetarian curries, the taste was good but it was not something we would crave for. Garlic naans were very good hot from the tandoor. The price is similar to other Indian restaurant in the town average 12-15$ per person.  Ambience was okay as they stuffed lot of artifacts in small place where you feel you are in very small room. I may not recommend this place as it didn't tantalize my taste buds. Service is very good as the food arrived in 15 min and the lady was courteous."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our Christmas dinner at The Dhaba. Given it was just two of us in town, I couldn't be bothered to cook a big traditional meal - this was one of the most memorable Christmas meals we've had!  My husband was immediately excited when we pulled up and noticed they have a store attached to the restaurant advertising British food (he's from Scotland).  So in addition to a delicious meal we were able to purchase Cadbury Flakes for dessert. The meal itself was unexpectedly good. We started out with an order of onion bhaji and a dish I don't remember the name of (aloo tikki chaat perhaps?), but it resembled a deconstructed samosa -- AMAZING!  We knew we wanted to try the Lamb Vindaloo and the waitress recommended we also go with the Chicken Tikka Masala. We asked the dishes be prepared based on the chefs recommended spice level. I was shocked by how much my husband enjoyed the tikka masala - not usually his favorite as he doesn't like anything sweet. The dish had the perfect amount of spice and creaminess. I also really enjoyed the lamb vindaloo, the flavors continued to build as the meal went on - and was really good for breakfast the next day.  The service was excellent. We found everyone to be very personable and able to provide great recommendations with some funny stories to tell. We sat near the hostess stand and I noticed that many people with 7pm reservations arrived early. The hostess handled the groups early arrival well, especially given there were two people serving all of the tables.   The menu is unique, offering much for vegetarians and carnivores alike. I wasn't feeling well and was happy sipping on my Chai tea (so yummy). We will definitely be back to enjoy another meal soon!"}
{"text":"Classy food, very good ambience & great deals always!! :) I've known Dhaba since its inception & the quality of food has always been impeccable. Veg Korma, Malai Kofta & the sampler platter are some of the favorites. One of the best restaurants in Tempe & a must visit for very good Indian food."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time because of the Groupon offer.  I cannot believe that in the four years I've worked at nearby ASU that I haven't been here before!  The space and service is warm and inviting.  But it's the food that will have us coming back.  Fresh, delicious, you can tell that they toast and grind their own spices.  My daughter always orders chicken pakora, which I usually find very blah, but at Dhaba it was fabulous--moist, tender white meat fried perfectly in a light crispy batter with just the right amount of spice.  And the paneer pakora was even better.  From the appetizers (try the bhatura chole!) onward, our meal was the best we've had in any Indian restaurant in the SE valley so far.  Oh, and it's a plus that they have white wines by the glass that compliment the food."}
{"text":"It was a super busy night and so service was initially a little slow, but what's the rush? Slow down, enjoy the experience.   Mango lassies - great  Veggie dumplings - outstanding   Garlic naan - very good  Veggie Paneer - again, great  Rice pudding - delicious  Host - gracious and kind   Go here if you want fantastic veggie Indian food. Don't bother ordering tikka masala like everyone else. Try something new."}
{"text":"Been twice to this place. The food is out of this world. We went yesterday and had the goat (which was the best thing we ate the first time), the chicken with spinach (upon recommendation of the waitress), the garlic naan and pistachio, cashew/almond naan, and the chickpeas. (I'm sorry for not remembering the Indian names of any plates.  Take your pick as to which tasted best.  This is delicious food. If you like Indian, I don't think you can find food better than this. And if you do, let me know where to go get it."}
{"text":"Man.  5/5 stars on yelp stands for \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\", and that's exactly how I'll describe my experience at The Dhaba.  Every item we ate was flavorful and unique, the service was spectacular, and the setting, with ornate decorations and cool water goblets, definitely qualifies as a perfect selection for a date or anniversary.  We had the chance to chat with the owner and his family - they're huge on service to the community, and they take care of the nearby metro stop (I believe they even donated the land to build it).  Food-wise, everything was delicious, but I especially recommend the mango chicken curry dish.  Seriously, though, just ask for recommendations and they'll guide you right.  Definitely will be back.  This one is going on my \"best of Phoenix\" list."}
{"text":"Only Indian restaurant i tried in the PHX area, I liked the food and the ambiance. Owners/managers seem very friendly tood.  Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"We started with one of Taz's cooking classes, and have quickly moved to calling this the best Indian restaurant in AZ.  The korma is pretty amazing.  Saag so fresh you feel like the spinach was just picked!  It's small and quaint but oh so worth it!"}
{"text":"Dinners and appetizer delicious! Best Indian food for sure. The decor was very delightful and clean. Reservations recommended for a Saturday night dining experience. The service was a little slow with delivering our dinners so they comped us desserts. We tried the \"donuts\" and \"carrot fudge\", I wasn't a fan of either one but I wasn't upset since we weren't paying for them. It was also fun to give them a try! Will definitely return to The Dhaba. Overall, a very good!"}
{"text":"Ambiance provides the right feel for Indian cuisine, including the copper rimmed tableware that I like.  Several lunch specials that include salad, soup, rice, entree, and naan were priced reasonably.  Service was pleasant.  Food was middle of the road.  Soup size was a little small. Naan was dense, thin, and chewy.  Not bad overall, but could be better.  Owner contacted me regarding my experience and I have good assurance it will be better next time, and I'll certainly return.  Great to see proprietors that truly care."}
{"text":"This place has now become my favorite Indian spot.  I have to express, again, that their system of placing a reservation is very needed and essential. Parking is extremely limited in the area (as it's a shopping center as well). I noticed a couple come in without a reservation, and were sort of put off by it.  They do have a little seating area if you forget, and wait time seems to be about 10-15 minutes or so...  That aside, let's talk about the food:  I always leave VERY full here, with leftovers for the next day. Their Kormas are divine. I will recommend the vegetarian option as it comes with cashews and golden raisins...a little spicy, sweet, and tart, and savory --- basically a perfect meal. The girls (servers) here are efficient, without being pushy, and attend to each table flawlessly.   It gets an extra star from me, today, for the decor. Restaurants really underestimate the power of nice surroundings. The Dhaba definitely took this into consideration when selecting the tableware, the lighting options, tables ect.  Oh, and P.S. get the Groupon, or check in on yelp/foursquare to score some amazing deals (I don't know why they keep doing this, because they're giving away food for free...but yeah, ya know, not complaining at the moment)."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Indian restaurant I have been to in the valley. I can't even remember what I ordered when I went but, I remember everything was delicious. Probably the best food I have ever eaten. I know this sounds dramatized, but, you could probably eat a napkin there and it would be the best napkin you have ever had."}
{"text":"Dhaba is considered an authentic Punjabi cuisine.  I have been to many North Indian cuisine restaurants, and I have an idea of what most of the dishes are.  Unfortunately with the Dhaba, you would have some of the similar lingo, but the name would be so long with other adjectives or Punjabi words that confused the heck out of me.  We finally figured out what we wanted, and ordered from our cute waitress.  We got the chana masala, palak paneer, and mutter paneer. For breads we got garlic naan and something else with a sweet taste.  The food was average at best, and the portion sizes were extremely small.  I had a Groupon for $30 for $60, and I can see the Groupon covering up the lack of quantity.    The ambiance is this place is pretty well light and glowing for a nice date who wants to try ethnic cuisines.  It is a decent place, but I would not come here if you really hungry."}
{"text":"The Dhaba is the Indian restaurant that I frequent almost monthly. Yes, I order the same two dishes all the time because they're very good. Chicken Tikka Masala and Butter chicken. (They're soo good!) Unfortunately, here they pretty much taste the same. It's not the best Indian food I've ever eaten, but it sure is one of the better Indian restaurants in the Valley. I've also tried the Spinach chicken/Saag. Was pretty disappointed (came out very bland and no spice at all). Maybe it was an off night for this. Consistency is very important to me in a restaurant and usually this place delivers. 4 stars for creating tasty food and great Naan overall, but lacking that extra deliciousness for a perfect score.    Service is good. You will have multiple servers throughout your dining experience. This is often a good thing! The downside: there's usually a long wait on the weekends. Very long wait! If you're on the fence about trying it, I'd say just go for it! You'll most likely enjoy it! At least I keep coming back for more..."}
{"text":"The food was incredible! I tried three dishes and was blown away by all three. The service was also great; I always had water and the staff was very friendly.   Try the Gobi Pakore and the Lahori Malai Kofta with garlic naan.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"If you enjoy Indian Food - try Dhaba!  It is SO GOOD!  And, they have great lunch specials, too.  I've come here for years & have always left happy."}
{"text":"Bad experience! Food was salty, gave us the wrong kind of bread. They couldn't even get the Chai right. Service is even worse. This explains why there were no Indians in this restaurant. Will not recommend"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the Valley. Great vegan selections as well.  The owner is very friendly as well as the staff.  They are also on Postmates, so I use them frequently for that too!  It was recommended to us by our Indian friend and it has not let us down!!   They also have a store next to the restaurant that you can buy Indian spices to make your own dishes at home."}
{"text":"Out of all the Indian restaurants that I've been to in the valley, this one is definitely the best one I've been to so far. Their curry dish is amazingly delicious. I wanted to order one that tastes sweet and this one is definitely favorable. Their flat bread is so fresh and I can't get enough of it.   I order a Mango Lassi and it tastes a bit weird to me. As for the dessert, I ordered rice pudding and it is a bit too sweet for my taste (still delicious). Service was average.    I will come back here again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"This place has the best Indian food, but is also the most expensive and serve the smallest portions. I had the tikka masala and was impressed but, was too small of a portion. This would be my go to Indian place but too pricy for too small of a portion. Give it a try tho, very authentic and great service."}
