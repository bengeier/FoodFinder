{"text":"Churros ???? No they are not a weird breed of dog... they are deep fried sticks of goodness rolled in sugar and cinnamon.   Made a detour to try these... never had them before. Found them tasty enough but rather harder/crisper than expected.  We tried plain, stuffed with dolce de Leche and Nutella. The neat thing is that they add the filling on order so the pastries don't get soggy. What is not to like?  I suspect that while they were made that morning that they would have been amazing if they were still warm. As it was they were tasty enough at room temp.  Brought home 6 different empanadas to try for dinner. The flavors were nice overall but a little too salty on one of the chicken ones for my taste and I didn't particularly love the spinach one... but then again it was made with spinach so we got what we paid for on that and shouldn't really complain... hahaha.  Our fave was the nicely balanced cranberry chicken - an unexpected surprise in an Argentinian joint...  The man at the cash (owner?) was very personable and helpful and patient with my Spanish attempt...  Would give a 3.75 stars but am happy to round up to 4. Reasonable value for the price and fun to try something new (for me). I cannot honestly say it was the best I have ever had empanada wise... but it was good for the price point and friendly service. Will be back to try for a warm Churros and some of the other flavors of empanadas..."}
{"text":"Churros were the bad boys I came here for and from which Che Churro gets their name. These fried choux based pastries can be considered latin version of a doughnut; a fritter that's rolled in sugar and cinnamon then traditionally filled with dulce de leche and eaten hot.  The warm gooey filling is a great contrast to the crispy crunch of the churro, whose ridges act as built in sugar and cinnamon holders. At a buck a piece - plain - I don't know how anyone would be able to stop at one... or two, for 15 churros in one sitting."}
{"text":"super cute little shop, with delicious churros and amazing coffee. The empanda menu was quite extensive."}
{"text":"These guys have the best churros in town.  They are amazing and the staff is very friendly  Good price too 12 filled churros for 16.50$ you cant go wrong with that.  They also have more latin food like many different empanadas like beef, spicy beef, corn, tuna and many many more."}
{"text":"Really good! The churros are delicious and quite decently priced. Also tried the Spanish hot chocolate which was really nice on a cold day. The churros were fried freshly upon ordering and the man who served us was so very pleasant and helpful. Although the place is quite small (three or four tables, I believe), I definitely recommend it; even if it's just to get something to go!"}
{"text":"Need churros?   Seriously, just go here.    They are that good. Perfectly crispy on the outside, amazingly soft on the inside."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place.I had just had some delicious Churros last month and really wanted one.I came late so this may be why the Churros i received were dried out and a little hard to chew. I ordered the filled ones and the filling made it edible and the flavor delicious.I will come back earlier to catch the fresher batch."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place today!! They serve crunchy churros which is odd since I'm used to soft churros but it was delicious -- mostly because of the amazing dulce de leche in them  also delicious are their empanadas. Got 2 empanadas to share with a coke for $6 something which is pretty decent. Tried the spinach & ricotta (yum) and the beef. Very yummy. If you're in the area, it's a must!"}
{"text":"The best churros in town.   Bonus: come during a week day when the owner is there and experience authentic mat√©. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to this place because of the reviews but really was't impressed... the churro was cold and my stomach was crying after that. Thank god i didn't throw up.."}
{"text":"This places sells the most DELICIOUS churros EVER, they now have nutella filling which is amazing!!! I love to have my morning coffee there and the staff is so nice!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to buy a churro. I recommend the savory one, parmagian. The place also has a small assortment of Latin foods such as tortillas and sauces. Friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Great churros, fresh and tastes crunchy. Very friendly service. Perfect for on the go, they offer the fillings, which I didn't try yet."}
{"text":"This place is as authentic as it gets. Churros made to perfection, crispy on the outside! Don't bother asking how they get the filling (chocolate or dulce leche) how ever they do it, it's awesome. Service was very pleasant and friendly.  I hesitated to try the new salty flavored churros. Didn't regret it one bit they were both amazing. The salsa flavor or the Parmesan  were both equally good."}
{"text":"Didn't get to snap a photo of the churros or empanadas because I got too eager to stuff them in my mouth!  I find the churros pleasantly sweet--not overwhelming. I highly recommend the nutella and dulce de leche filling. I kind of wish the churros were warmer when I ate them, but overall I still find them very satisfying."}
{"text":"i came here and ordered a dozen churros. the guy in front of me ordered 400 churros. so the lady making the churros told me i had to wait an hour to get my 12 churros. i waited an hour as i came all the way here already but thought maybe next time, she should tell the guy who ordered 400 churros to wait, instead of me who only ordered 12 churros. im sure the guy who ordered 400 churros would have understood he had to wait a bit longer since he ordered 400 freaking churros last minute and she still has to cater to her other customers ordering walk in churros. she told me if i had ordered 1 or even 6 churros, the wait was still an hour lol. so you would make a person ordering 1 churro wait an hour so u can serve the dude who ordered 400 churros first? yes its first come first serve but i think she could have been a bit more accommodating. overall, the churros were ok, they were a bit too hard for my liking but my boyfriend seemed to enjoy them. i probably wont return unless im really craving churros. i havent had any other churros in montreal so i cant say if they were the best, but i definitely did have better churros outside of montreal. they have filled churros as well as plain ones rolled in cinnamon sugar. 3 stars because of the service."}
{"text":"Quick shop to go if your craving something sweet, been finding some Churro places here in Montreal, this was the first shop that I found and I'm not disappointed! The places and the people working seem so cheering !!!!! I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Customer service was amazing! The Churros were phenomenal! The empanadas were delicious. Happy I finally tried this place."}
{"text":"Been enjoying their churros now for YEARS! My friend tends to pick up 2 dozens from them every time she comes over. One is the standard type, the other is filled with dolce di lecce and it's FANTASTIC people.  I can't comment on the wait times, the price tag or what not... just the goods and believe me when I say.... the goods are sublime.  ALL HAIL THE KINGS AND QUEENS OF CHURROS!"}
{"text":"What can I say ? They make a solid churro, its everything you want a churro to be and more :) nice, crispy and golden on the outside and you can get it plain or filled (I like the dulce de leche filled one the best)!  I've also had their empanadas which are also very well made and you can choose from a variety of different tasty fillings some more traditional and some with a bit of a twist but nothing too crazy , just fresh simple Ingredients that are well prepared. The service is friendly and their prices are very affordable. Although there is some seating inside, The location is small and not necessarily somewhere I would go for a sit down meal or snack , it's more of a take out sort of place. That being said , I can safely say this place has one of the best churros in the city and their empanadas are on point as well."}
{"text":"Stopped on my long drive back to the USA and boy was I in for a surprise. These little crispy sticks are so much fun. They stayed crisp all day. Very well priced and the girl at the shop was super sweet and accommodating."}
{"text":"Thanks Che Churro for fixing my Churro need the other morning.  There is nothing to compare with a freshly made (aka FRIED) churro  - WITH  - and this is the important part... tasty thick HOT CHOCOLATE.  I first tried this dish in Madrid about 30 years ago and it remains one of my favorite treats.  In Madrid it's a breakfast treat - but I can eat them anytime.  I think this is the ONLY place that offers them in Montreal - and although it's a bit off the beaten track (tourist wise at least) it's worth the trek.  The chocolate was creamy thick - the perfect consistency.  Not too sweet as the churros are dusted in sugar do some of the sweet lifting.  The churros were perfectly fried - crispy on the outside and almost creamy on the inside.  The best delivery vehicle on the planet for thick hot chocolate.  Even in summer - this was a special treat.    Plus the store has products from throughout Latin America if you're looking for purple corn from Peru etc...  The product line is focused more on South America than Central America.  Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I go there for their churros, they are indeed AMAZZINGG !!! They also have a variety of Latin American products at reasonable prices."}
