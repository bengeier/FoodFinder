{"text":"We ate here yesterday (Sunday) for dinner.  This was my second time here, although we used to eat here quite a bit when it was Old Country Buffet.   We were surprised to learn it was mostly asian food on our first visit, but we loved it!  The wide variety of buffet tables is just amazing.  I have honestly never seen so much food in one place at one time. There are hot foods, cold foods, sushi bar, dessert bar, everything you can imagine.  Most everything I tried was great! The cost can be a little high if you have a large family as I do, but the kids pigged out and really enjoyed their meals and even tried new things. The ambiance is a little offputting, not sure what it is, the tables are strange, carpet is weird, etc.  We were seated VERY close to other parties, so close that a man pushed my daughter when he stood up behind her and a waitress had her butt in our faces trying to take a pic of the party next to us. Overall, a good experience, 4 out of 5."}
{"text":"I can't find anything bad to say about this place. That being said, some items are a little lackluster. The food is hot, and there are many items on the buffet to enjoy, both Asian and American. Items like the egg drop soup and dumplings are definitely missing something to make them \"pop\", but they certainly aren't bad. Service is good too. They make sure your glass is filled and take your empty dishes away promptly."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch found out they closed down, moved to the old Tambellini's on rt 51 towards pgh. Sry to see them move heard landlord raised rent higher. I live in plum so thats a far drive but i might travel to try them there. Today's 9/16/14"}
{"text":"I took my whole family to this restaurant for the first time. With 6 of us, it is sometimes hard to find something where the prices are reasonable and the food is good. We all had plenty to eat. Their buffet had something for everyone, including my daughter who asks for Macaroni and Cheese at every place we go. They also have online printable coupons at their website to save money at both the lunch buffet and dinner buffet. I highly recommend going with a family or larger group. They were busy tonight, but there was plenty of room to sit. The food was coming out as quickly as the trays were being emptied. My only regret was there were some crab leg hogs and I was unable to get any, but that is not the fault of the restaurant. We definitely plan on going back!"}
{"text":"Thankfully, my grandmother has basically no concept of the internet. I don't think she has ever been online before. And most certainly she would think that yelp is something a dog says.  I can't stand this place. And she just loooooves to come here. I have probably eaten here at least half a dozen times (once on Thanksgiving of all days). The food is pretty good. It is a buffet after all, so it isn't totally trash. But just looking around the place, I want to call in the special investigators of the fashion police. There is just something about the place that irritates me. But hey. As far as everyone else knows, I think this place is great. If my grandma likes it, I like it more. Whatever makes her happy."}
{"text":"Ate here today and found it quite reasonable. For a weekend lunch buffet it is $8.79 + tax, tip. This place is HUGE. You could probably sit 200 people in there. The quality of the food is not that fantastic, as one usually expects at a buffet, but there is a lot of variety. This is not really a place for vegetarians to go to however.  The sushi situation needs improvement. There is a tiny bar where only one guy can make a few pieces at a time, so if the sushi line gets slammed, if will take you forever to get any. It would be better if they had a larger sushi bar with a few guys just working full time on the sushi putting out some plates of it.  Didn't get any water refill though, so I was disappointed about the service. But overall, I would be inclined to check this place out again. The main attraction for me is the sushi however. You can also get sushi to go and the prices looked reasonable.   The exterior looks crappy, but the interior is quite nice. And they play traditional Chinese music. I love it when Chinese restaurants do this instead of playing the 'soft hits of the 90s.'  Food Quality/Taste = 3 Portion Size Given Price = 5 Stars Price = 4 Stars Service = 2 Experience with Staff = 3 Stars Decor = 4"}
{"text":"After a so-so experience at the new Old Town Buffet on 51, I was a bit hesitant to try Yu's in the Southland Shopping Center. I'm not to keen on Asian buffets as I mentioned in previous reviews, so it took some bribing to get me through the door. All I can say is, I'm so glad the bribe worked!  The last time I was here was years ago before it went under new ownership. It was a typical American buffet... cheap and did the trick. Yu's is that and more. Comparing it to the other location on 51 (I'm not sure, but they may have the same owner), EVERYTHING is better. From selection, food temperature and atmosphere. They have at least 8-10 stations to visit and the variety of food is amazing. I even found myself eating more of the Asian choices because everything was just that good. The ratio of American food to Asian food is pretty equal... From salads, to meat, to pasta and even sushi (it's enclosed in a case and is considered \"the Sushi Bar\") you will find something you like.  Service was good, too. Though, at a buffet you're not interacting too much with waitstaff.   For only about $13 a dinner, it was well worth the price and I will most definitely return."}
{"text":"I good buffet with lots of western and Asian items. From the name I had no idea it was an Asian buffet. During lunch today, I particularly like the London Broil cooked to medium, mashed potatoes, and corn. The apple strudel was excellent!  Sushi is while you wait and it wasn't busy, so I had the chef fix me up some Salmon sushi. The rice isn't great, but the fish was actually pretty good. I wasn't hungry enough to try the Mongolian grill, but it looked nice.  Not up to the level of Hokkaido, but cheaper especially for dinner."}
{"text":"This is probably the best deal in town, especially for lunch, and especially if you like sushi. I don't but still eat here fairly often because of the huge selection of food on the buffet, and most of it is pretty good."}
{"text":"one of my favorite buffets in pittsburgh. yu's offer a huge selection of asian food AND american food for the kids who may not be big fans of chinese food yet. they also have a wonderful sushi bar where customers can requests custom sushi rolls for the dinner menu!   the mongolian grill allows you to be creative in the creation of your own stir fy! for weekend dinners, you can also order steak and have it grilled right in front of you. and the endless crablegs at dinner. omg! the wealth of options and variety at yu's is awesome and even more mind boggling is how affordable it is! I recommend this very very highly!   they also have a monthly drawing for customers (children and seniors) to win free meals! I loveee yu's old town buffet!"}
