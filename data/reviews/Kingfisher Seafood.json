{"text":"Homemade seafood goodness just outside of the downtown core. I've had the special (calamari starter followed by shrimp and scallops entree) and I've also tried other items on the menu. I recommend trying the special on a first visit before venturing out"}
{"text":"Excellent seafood, quick and friendly service. A great hidden gem for lunch in Calgary. Highly recommend the calamari with hot sauce and the prawns and scallops in hot sauce. So yum! Mouth is salvating just writing this review :)"}
{"text":"Environment: Hidden gem in china town! The place atmosphere is dated, but quite clean. Good for casual dining. 

Food: I ordered the sample platter and I was quite impressed! The spicy sauce scallops was delicious and full of flavour. The calamari tasted fresh, perfectly battered, and the dipping sauce was good combination! The tempura was crispy and again flavourful. The side salad could use some work as it was only lettuce and dressing.

Service: The server was very polite and friendly. They were closing when we arrived but he insisted on us coming in, which I'm very glad that we did. The service was prompt and he always checked on us during our stay. I would recommend going to this place and would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover.  I'm sorry to say that's exactly what I did and have missed out on some really good food.  This place does seafood right!  I've only had the opportunity to try 2 dishes, but so far so good!  I will certainly be back soon to try more. 

Tempura prawns and veggies...4.5 stars.  The yams and prawns were coated and fried in a light batter.  The prawns were cooked to perfection (doesn't get any better than this).  The yams were good but needed just a few more seconds of draining...I could still see some oil clinging on the surface as I cut through with my fork.  I don't think either one was seasoned but the batter was so light that you could taste the natural flavors of the yam and prawns, which was delightful.  For more flavor, the accompanying sweet light soy sauce will do the trick.

Fried calamari...5 stars.  This is definitely one of the best fried calamari dishes in town.  Leave it to a seafood place to prepare the calamari perfectly.  When you take your first bite and your teeth cuts through the meat with ease and pulls away cleanly, you just know it was done right!  Thank you Kingfisher for scoring your calamari!  This helps to make it even easier to bite into and adds more surface area for the flour to cling onto.  Speaking of flour, the calamari was lightly coasted with visible specks of black pepper, but don't let them fool you...this dish may look like it's pepper-salted, but it's not....not much salt was present (hence the name \"fried calamari\").  If you need more salt, the dish comes with a side of Sambal pepper sauce."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty tame.  I settled for the lunch bento box because it had a variety of items and quite frankly, I thought their menu prices were kind of high.  They have a self-proclaimed statement of having the best calamari in the City but I've definitely had much better at a few other places.  The food was decent but nothing really stood out for me, though the battered fish was light and crispy.  Service was pretty good and I'm glad to have given them a try."}
