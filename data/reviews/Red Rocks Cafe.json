{"text":"Googled a quiet restaurant in Charlotte. This was a gem. Call ahead gave us a table as we walked in. The service is professional and the food amazing. The spinach queso would feed a crowd. The wine list was big. I enjoyed the Barosso cabsauv. My lobster ravioli was the best ever served with succulent shrimp and scallops in a smooth creamy sauce. My husband raved about the jambalaya. We couldn't resist the dessert tray. Wow!  Vanilla mousse cheesecake and Coconut Cake with pineapple cream filling were more than we could handle but believe me they won't go to waste. Maybe to waist. Families, couples, anyone will find this warm atmosphere a place for great food and drink. Outdoor seating is charming but it was 37 degrees F tonight."}
{"text":"Two small words.... CHOCOLATE CAKE!  Actually it's not small at all it's HUGE.  Can I just say, the best I ever had.   I love coming here for a nightcap and to squelch my hankering for something sweet.  It is pretty crowded late nights in the bar area.    But the bartenders are really on top of things so it's never a problem.  They have a great selection of wine at reasonable prices.    I haven't eaten real food here yet.  Unless you count the cake but I'm looking forward to it and will let you know..."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch there. Had the Reuben sandwich it was Delicious! Nice place and service.  Must try the delcious chocolate cake next time."}
{"text":"This was such a waste of money. Ordered the chicken formaggio pasta with a \"four cheese sauce.\" The chicken was dried out, mushrooms looked canned or as if they had been soaking in water for hours, there was barely any \"sauce\" covering the pasta. Little cheese shreds that weren't completely melted as the \"sauce.\" No flavor whatsoever. Meatloaf didn't taste like anything, veggies on the side were still partially raw. Pissed off about such poor quality food for $16 a plate. Paid less at Maggiano's and got 4 pasta plates, an appetizer and dessert. What a shitty place.  Oh, and my fork had an old piece of dried out food in it."}
{"text":"I just had dinner at Red Rocks Cafe in Birkdale. I was there with my wife and brother-in-law and we had a very enjoyable dinner. The wait staff was prompt and accommodating. It was no problem at all to customize my entree to my particular tastes. We definitely chose a great restaurant. After dinner, our waiter brought us a display of homemade cheesecakes and other desserts. Well definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There is nothing not to like about Red Rocks Cafe.  I have had many lunches and dinners at this location and several dinners at the South Park location and I have never been disappointed in the food or the service.  The fish and the meat always taste fresh and always are perfectly prepared.  I usually order one of the specials, and they are always interesting and tasty.  The bar also always does a good job on the drinks.  Why four and not five stars?  There is not, I suppose, a \"wow\" factor here, in the food, in the service, or in the ambiance.  Still, it is always a place to have a good meal well served."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times before and was hoping it would be better each time I went and it really wasn't.  The food is okay, my filet was cooked at the right tempature and the Oscar topping was a nice addittion, but I could get the same steak with more flavor for $10 cheaper.  My girlfriend seemed to like her food, but wasn't blown away by it, and the shrimp cocktail appetizer was average.  My complaints would be that the restaurant is extremely loud.  It seems like you are in a cafeteria!  I struggled to hear the waiter along with being able to carry on a conversation at the table.  Also, the use of race car drivers for every item on the menu is obnoxious...WE GET IT, you have had nascar drivers eat here!!!!  I think the waiter was new, because he seemed unsure about anything and everything he did, although the service was fine.  The best thing about this place is the location, its close to the movie theatre and to some shopping."}
{"text":"This place was just ok. The server we had was horrible. No personality whatsoever. When I had another waitress stop her from putting in my order because I wanted to add/change something, she visually was irritated making gestures you would expect from a 2 year old child who had a toy taken from them or you asked them to go to bed. I had never seen this in my life from a server I was truly shocked.  Her name was Christine. If you decide to go don't let her help you.  I called her out on this and of course lied and said the lady said something else but I totally caught her off guard.   The food was just ok nothing special or delicious to make me want to come back. Had I not had this experience I may have desired to go back and try another dish. I had salad and a fillet w/ mashed potatoes. I had to send my food back be sure it clearly wasn't cooked to the appropriate temperature. Then my sides got cold.   My friend that I was dining with had blackened tilapia and that was pretty good. But this service makes me never want to go there again. After all the server and the service you receive at a restaurant is very important. I eat out all the time. I consider myself to know what great service is. This was by far the worse.   I was really disappointed in Red Rocks. I was looking forward to a great experience. ; ("}
{"text":"I was not impressed!  I ordered the special, scrimp gumbo, and it tasted like they gave me the burnt scraps from the bottom of the pot. The waitress was no better. She seemed bitter and was not pleased in serving my table! In addition, it was way too dark in there!!! I won't b back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Very nice ambience, good food, convenient location, and lots to choose from on menu.  Service varies from pretty good to stellar.  Good options for vegetarians and pescetarians as well as meat eaters.  Appropriate for business as well as pleasure."}
{"text":"In February, husband and I had a disappointing visit to Red Rocks and had the opportunity to try again.  The revisit is why I like giving restaurants a second chance as long as they're not super-scary bad (which Red Rocks wasn't at all; we just found it disappointing for a variety of reasons). Any restaurant can have an off night, especially when it's crowded for a holiday.   This time we started with the spinach queso dip, which was delicious. I chose another steak, this time a center-cut sirloin, while my husband had the kobe burger. He also enjoyed two cocktails, which I cannot remember but he liked very much. The food was much more flavorful, the meat cooked to order, and the service spot on. As before, the dessert was splendid (carrot cake for me, Oreo cheesecake for him), and we were comfortable and well attended throughout the meal.  Thank you to the owners of RR for inviting us back. We would be happy to return now and have marked RR as one of our go-to spots."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Got a filet cooked medium. It was over cooked and dry. Green beans had no flavor."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place after church, since service is fast and you can count on high quality. Today we asked if Red Rocks is LGBT friendly in view of the Legislature's recent law passed to legalize discrimination. We wanted to to ensure the comfort of all our diners and got a resounding \"yes, of course!\" Stephanie took care of us today and was friendly and efficient, delivering extra salad dressings and drink refills without us asking.  The food is always fresh and generous in size too. We've never been disappointed so we will be back, probably next Sunday!"}
{"text":"My initial post expressing my experience was not written with the intent of the Red Rocks management staff responding. However, two management level staff reached out to me. The food and wait staff are great. And my first review merely expressed the location of my seat was not optimal. I'm glad to know the management staff care enough about their reputation and strive for patrons to have great experience all the way around. I will return again in the future."}
{"text":"Went to red rocks on a whim with my wife, and we loved it! Had the she-crab soup which was amazing and the calamari to start. Great service, great food. Simple enough"}
{"text":"Food is ok, not great. It is overpriced for the quality of food.  There is a good atmosphere inside and there is a large outdoor patio.  My wife and I had our first date here. If the food was better and the pricing more reasonable, we would go back more than once every few years."}
{"text":"Red Rocks has always been one of our favorite places for dinner. So we went for the Easter brunch and it was a huge disappointment. The waiter was aloof and rarely checked on us. The food came out cold. The salmon was undercooked and the filet was over cooked. The grits were hard and dry. We were there for almost 2 hours. And they ran out of items on a preset menu!!! How does that happen?  My husband and I both agreed we would not be returning for a long time after the amount of money we spent on such a disappointing Easter Day experience. :("}
{"text":"Excellent food at reasonable prices. Great crab cake sliders and spinach dip. Highly recommend!  Enjoyed the atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Great food and good,  attentive service.  I have been SLIGHTLY disappointed with a few specials,  but when I stick to the menu, I am never dissatisfied.  Their deserts are worth the trip alone  (although I understand they are made off site.)"}
{"text":"My husband took me to red rocks for lunch. I have allergies and was worried about finding something to eat that sounded good in my pregnant state. The water was nice and took 3 options I was thinking about back to the chef. The original recipes called for black pepper. So The chef made a wine reduction sauce for me instead of the marinara. It was very tasty. We enjoyed our experience and would come back again. If you get apps, main course and desert, you will rack up a bill fast."}
{"text":"We do Red Rocks often.  Great food and good service.  The menu always has something worth trying.  We loved it everytime."}
{"text":"Great place to entertain guests for a great meal and service. Food is always enjoyable and atmosphere is relaxing."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best place for a business outing or even a big get together. Your time at red rocks will be the beat you have ever had"}
{"text":"Quality food at a slightly higher price in a low lit restaurant with good charm.    The vibe here is relaxing.  It's the type of place that feels quiet while you're there, yet you feel like you can speak in a normal voice without the booth next to yours being disturbed.    I've had the Kobe burger, crab cakes and the chicken salad sandwich.  The Kobe burger sells for only 10.99 or so, and is well worth the price.  Kobe beef makes for a pretty fantastic fancy-urger.   The crab cakes were pretty good.  Not too dry, but the seasoning and sauces overpowered the meat.  But it's tough to do shellfish right so far from their harvest point, and at the price they sell it at Red Rock.  So the additives probably did a good job to mask a mediocre flavor. The chicken salad sandwich was a chicken salad sandwich.  I probably wouldn't get that again for the 8.99 I paid.    Their beer selection isn't fantastic.  But they do have some good staples.  Yuengling, Guiness, Blue Moon and a light lager of some type fill their taps.  Pretty standard.    I'd probably not eat here if it weren't so close to my home.  But as it is, I've partaken a couple times and felt both times that the food and atmosphere was worth the price."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch at the Providence Road location was a huge disappointment. The choices were limited and the scrambled eggs tasted like they came in a box. No breakfast sausage, grits or quiche. A basic beverage was an extra charge. Won't be returning for Mother's Day next year."}
{"text":"Great food! The atmosphere is wonder, private boots, white linen table cloths, subtle lighting. You must must must save rom for Deseret! We have had breakfast and lunch here and was satisfied but not wowed. The main complaint is the service. We have had super aggressive service that was annoying and then service where we had to chase the waitress down and she was extremely off put by our large group that was there for just desserts. It was almost to"}
{"text":"This is my favorite local restaurant. Everything I have ever ordered has been excellent. The calamari is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Red Rocks helped us with our Corporate Kick Off / End of the Year / Thank You Party. We had people coming in from all over the state with all kinds of food demands. Red Rocks was the perfect fit for us as the menu had something for everyone and everyone was very happy with their choices, and if you have ever planned a party for 20+ you know how difficult that can be.  We originally planned our party in January, but due to weather we had to reschedule. We got no fuss from the restaurant, they helped us find a new time and locked us in. We are very grateful for that!   The room was ready for us when we arrived. We do these dinners a few times a year and this is often not the case. With such large groups to accommodate this can be a major frustration, but Red Rocks handled it very well. All of our guests walked in and a server was there to get them drinks from the bar immediately! That never happens for us!  Once orders were in, our food was out very quickly and all at the same time. So we didn't have to sit for 15 minutes with food in front of half of our guests waiting on the other half, which happens so often. (Personally, having worked in the food service industry I am very impressed by that.) The wait staff was efficient and unobtrusive and really quietly blended into the back ground allowing us to focus on each other rather than the constant disruptions that you often get with parties like these.  So if you, like we do, like dealing with professionals and expect high quality I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Red Rocks to you after our experience. The next time we do an event in the Huntersville area, we will certainly use them again!"}
{"text":"Great place for a casual meal that's a little nicer than just a diner or bar. Amazing selection of dessert. The burgers are really good here but my favorite is the crab cake sandwich."}
{"text":"Just ordered take out. What a joke. $10 for approximately 12 chips. Not to mention the pick up process took 10 minutes at 4pm on a Sunday. Service is slow! Will never order take out again. Last time we are in the restaurant, the food was great. I ordered the salmon, my husband ordered a steak ( the one with blue cheese) . Salmon was better than the steak. The service was fine. The problem that night was the rude hostess. Argued with me about my reservation.  Said I made it for the birkdale location (I'm not an idiot, I've made plenty of reservations in my day). I showed her the open table confirmation and she was still snotty. Only could offer us a first come table in the bar. There are too many better restaurants in the area to ever go back."}
{"text":"We went to Red Rocks for Mothers Day brunch.  We were surprised by the price fixed menu because the website had described more of a buffet which we found out was only for the Birkdale Village location.  Instead, for $35.00 we had a choice of salmon, prime rib, Chicken Marsala or crab cakes Benedict.  Since it was only 10:30 we opted for the Benedict while my son got the prime rib.  We received our entries before we were done with our soup and about 5 minutes after we ordered.  Obviously they were ready for a crowd as it was all done in advance.  Pancakes were cold and had a strange flavor- the plastic packet of syrup didn't exactly help.  The eggs were overcooked and the English muffin was hard as rock.  Ugh!  People were not happy and we watched three groups look at the menu and walk out.  Meanwhile, it seemed like there were a ton of managers around and they were all taking selfies!    If you have been to Red Rocks, you know how big their cake slices are.  Well, brunch came with cake but it was this little tiny square piece - like 2x2.    We felt totally ripped off.  We have always liked the place because of the outdoor seating but it will be a long time before we go back.  The bait and switch on the website was unforgivable."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly people, great service. Our server, lucky, yep that's his name was so knowledgeable that he made our experience perfect. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch around a year ago and found it pretty good. Went back last November with 5 people for lunch and food was horrible.my wife & daughter had Kobe beef burgers which were both overcooked to death.my son-in-law had a fish salad which only the fish was edible, the lettuce was old. I had a salad which was just on! The waitress was horrible, waited 70 minutes for food to come out and then no one ate.left 2 burgers behind minus one bite each and a droopy salad for the price of $85.00.would have been better off at Burger King for $25.00.save your money , don't eat here."}
{"text":"We found Red Rock on Yelp and was not disappointed.  The staff was attentive and very accommodating. We both were enjoying a crispy salad when dinner was brought out.  Way to soon for us. Apparently, from watching the other diners, everyone here eats fast! Our waitress, Brittany,was very happy to hold our dinner until we were ready. The lobster ravioli was chock full of lobster (I believe it was claw meat) with a delicate white sauce containing bay scallops and small shrimp. It was very delicious. My husband had the bbq ribs, it is NC after all,  and they were fall of the bone scrumptious. Christopher Naue, the general manager, stopped by to welcome us  That's always a nice touch Go enjoy you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"First time at Red Rocks Cafe. I had an unforgettable dish, Shrimp & Grits Ravioli!!  It was amazing!!  Service was great, as well as, the atmosphere.   Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I had a meeting in the area and decided to splurge. Have been to Red Rocks many times for lunch and love the Jake Kyle Spinach Salad. It was excellent as usual.  But it was so expensive, I think that's the last time they'll see me. Yes, I was prepared for the $9 salad. I knew adding chicken was another $4.50 but what put it over the edge was the $0.95 charge to get the chicken blackened. My check for that salad and only tap water to drink was over $15 and with a tip (service was great) my bill was almost $19 FOR A SPINACH SALAD! I'm feeling ripped-off."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a number of times and had lovely meals. Tonight, however, trying to get a table for 2 we were offered a small table by a main entry which we turned down, our other choice was sharing a banquette with others at a small table which was also turned down.  The restaurant was possibly 1/3 full with many empty tables, but they would not accommodate us. The Thai restaurant next door is excellent!"}
{"text":"Red Rocks' food is pretty top notch as far as I'm concerned.  I had a She Crab soup which was decadent (is it acceptable to refer to a non-dessert item as \"decadent\"?  It was very rich, and delicious), and every item I've gotten there has ranged in quality from good to gourmet.  The crab cakes, for example, were pretty tasty, if not out of this world, and they were accompanied by simple fresh vegetables.  If you have a bigger stomach than me, or if you're just prowling around for dessert, you should try their desserts.  I say this not because I have (I'm always too full) but because they _look_ very good, and I've often read that they have some of the best desserts in Charlotte.  Decor is nice.  I almost feel bad going in there in t-shirt and jeans... but not so bad that I stop.  Service is good, and very helpful (\"I've never had She Crab soup\" and she brought out a small sample).  In fact, the one reason I don't go there more often is that their prices are a bit on the high side.  I think Yelp's price range system fails here: I would typically go to restaurants rated \"$$,\" but since it says \"$$$\" is more than $31/person, I have to put Red Rocks in the \"$$\" category.  In reality, look to be spending $50 for two people here, which is just outside my comfort range."}
{"text":"We reserved the dining room for my parent's surprise 40th wedding anniversary, and Red Rocks exceeded my expectations! I was SO impressed with how beautiful the dining room was set up - not only did they have the tables beautifully decorated, but there was a Christmas tree and fireplace - absolutely gorgeous! I felt that the price was the best that I could find for what we were aiming to do - a lot of restaurants charge an arm and a leg to reserve, but I felt that Red Rocks was VERY fair with the price. The staff was absolutely phenomenal. I was impressed with the waiter and waitress who were able to keep every person's order as we mingled. The food also came out super fast! If you are looking for a restaurant for your event, Red Rocks is a MUST! I will definitely be returning for events that I organize. I'm so grateful that Red Rocks helped create such a stress free and memorable surprise 40th anniversary for my parents, family, and friends!"}
{"text":"Love this place. We went to thanksgiving here and they had a great buffet although it was inconveniently placed if you were sitting outside. There also wasnt ham...which my husband griped about but the food offered was really good and it was much better than cooking and all that stress"}
{"text":"Birkdale is a wonderful place to go.  Lots of outdoor seating with benches and lovely planters.  There is a kid friendly fountain area that is gated in the middle of the shopping square for little ones to cool off.    Shops are fab, higher priced, but I always go for the sales racks anyway, especially in this economy.  A girl HAS to get something new from time to time.  Red Rocks Cafe has a very nice, starbucks-ish ambiance to it.  Private high back booths both large and small.  You can spill your guts to a friend and feel that, for the most part, people behind you aren't listening.  Enough of my gibberish!  The food was great.  I got the salad with chicken tenders on the top.  Ranch dressing on the side so that I feel in control of the portion (of course without my girlfriend knowing I licked the dressing cup clean when she went to the bathroom shhh!).  Iced tea to drink, even though it has to be 5:00 somewhere, so that I can mind my P's & Q's at lunch and not embarrass myself in front of the youngsters.  The bill with tip was $20 total.  The servers name was Grant C, and I think he thought I was flirting, but all I wanted was a pie to go.  Hey, I'm trying here!  All in all, 4 stars!"}
{"text":"The great group of people we were with and the beer aside (since they don't control that) it's amazing that RR's continue to exist. I guess their \"tradition\", \"location\" or whatever sustains them.....certainly not food quality. I went to Red Rocks by choice about 10 years ago for the first (and last) time. Ten years later we went tonight for a group event. The \"second last time\" if you will. The She Crab soup tasted old and salty. The Rib Eye was about as low a cut and cooked with as little flavor as possible. At $25, not a good investment.  Usually I like to make reviews with motivational direction but apparently they don't need it if they survived the last recession without the need to improve quality. So I guess they deserve begrudging kudos in a way!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time this past week and it was amazing! I ordered the Cajun pasta and it was the best pasta I have ever had! We would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Very very bad service. The two hostesses looked as bored as possible when we arrived. No greeting. We spoke first. With as little enthusiasm possible, one led us to a spartan, outdoor area, enclosed by a tent, with heat lamps, on a cold rainy day. We were one of two tables and then alone in the sad room. Did she offer us another option when we showed obvious dismay, of course not. That being said, our server did offer any other table in the outdoor area, but nothing inside. Food just ok. Server never came back to get our credit card, had to bring it in to a manager. On our way out we passed what had to be a manager, some guy in suit and tie at the hostess stand inputting something really important into the computer. \"Hey folks, thanks\" ahhhh NO, not a word to us, not even a glance to say goodbye and thank you. Didn't even look up from the computer. Never going back."}
{"text":"I have dined at Red Rocks for a few years.  I have never been disappointed with the food or service.  Of particular note is Karen at the hostess station.  She is the epitome of customer service.  It could be months since my last dining experience and she ALWAYS remembers my name, greets with a smile, and usually a hug.    The menu has a broad range of offerings.  The chicken salad is very good as is the Reuben (corned beef or turkey).  Those are my usual go-to choices but I have ventured to other dishes and never been disappointed.  Their desserts are quite good, especially the coconut cake.  It can get a little noisy at times but there is plenty of seating indoors and on the patios.  The restaurant is always clean, as are the restrooms (very important), and the service is always friendly.  Staff has always been attentive, well-groomed, and professional."}
{"text":"Red rocks is one of those places that just is for me - the food isn't bad but it also isn't good and definitely doesn't push any boundaries. I always feel very out of place here, as it seems like the only people here are regulars. They do make a good salad though."}
{"text":"Red Rocks was ok. We very much enjoyed the ambiance and our extremely friendly Server. We we're impressed with the spread on the menu as it has something for everyone.  The food wasn't great though for the price. We started with the queso dip which was fine. My husband got the bison meatloaf and it was more like meatball parmesan. I had a salad with Salmon which was ok. The portions were great but the taste was bland.  We would go backs for drinks and an app but not a full dinner. For a Friday night we were a bit surprised how  family friendly it was."}
{"text":"Generally, we've had good experiences here.  However, Easter Brunch was a train wreck. Prix fixe menu, which wasn't indicated anywhere on their site prior to making the reservation. Normally, not an issue, but since we'd had a big dinner planned at home, we just wanted a small meal and did not want to commit to a three course ordeal. Fine, we went with the flow. However, at 1:30 they were already out of deviled eggs, red velvet cake, and even the vanilla cake that wasn't on the menu and was offered as a substitute to the red velvet cake. Instead our only choice was 4 slices of chocolate cake. Our filet was horribly overcooked, salmon should have been advertised as sushi, and the replacement filet was equally overcooked and had no flavor whatsoever. Service was inept, no visible management, and we were there for over 2 hours. I would expect more from such a staple."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Took care of my daughter and friends for her sweet 16. Staff was very attentive and welcoming. Provided birthday cake and amazing food. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!!! The she crab soup amazing! The Chilean Sea Bass is the best I've ever had!  Make sure you don't skip desert, they are all out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"Come here every time I'm in town. Food is always amazing! Love the specials. The weekend always seem to have a great bar crowd as well."}
{"text":"Really nasty greasy Cajun ribeye.  The staff was young and didn't ask how the steak was instead they delivered an oily mess...it was $30 and not good.  When the plate came out there was a bath of grease that the steak and risotto sat in.  I went home and gargled with salt water to get the layer of grease out of my mouth.  When they picked up my plate and half was still there they didn't ask if it was good or bad.  Not eating here again."}
{"text":"My husband & I happened on this place for lunch today and could not have chosen a better one.  The server gave exactly the right amount of attention keeping our drinks nicely filled...checking on us at just the right intervals.  My husband ordered the jambalaya and specified that he could only eat it if it was not terribly spicy.  When the order arrived it was a bit spicy for his taste buds but he told the waiter he was willing to eat it anyway.  Within moments someone in management came to the table noting that even though he was eating his food, he looked a little less than satisfied so she was ordering a replacement for him.  She left the plate in front of him in case he was hungry enough to munch on it while the next order was prepared.  I can't remember the last time we have seen restaurant staff so eager to please!  The replacement food as well as everything else was excellent!  Kudos to you Red Rocks Cafe!  I'm coming back and bringing a friend!"}
{"text":"Went back with my wife and daughter. Tried their mini crab cakes and a salad with cranberries and almonds which was rather good but was mainly impressed with their cakes: they are excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service in a well managed restaurant.  The bison meatloaf very good and the steak was outstanding.  Perfectly prepared and served."}
{"text":"Appetizers and a drink while sitting outside. Awesome place to do that bruchetta and caso were good choices"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious!!! We had a large party and everyone's food was so good with no complaints. I had the crab cakes and I can honestly say they are the best crab cakes I had so far in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Made the trip today for a late lunch/early dinner while Christmas shopping.  Food and service was great as always.  Happy Chris was there.  He's the primary reason we go.....always a genuine smile and a friendly visit and conversation."}
{"text":"I have only been here for brunch but I can tell you it is amazing.  I am dreaming of going back here for brunch soon.  We had stuffed french toast that was out of this world.  Our waiter was awesome and we could not have been happier.  My husband is an eater so we ordered 3 entrees- one each and the french toast to split.  We ended up taking home leftovers as the portions were large."}
{"text":"We were just passing through on our way back to New York and decided to stop in for dinner with our children. Loved it! The expansive menu is suitable to any pallet and surprise- they offer a nice kids menu complete with stickers. The ambience, food, service were perfection.  Definitely plan to come back when we are back in town."}
{"text":"Ive been here plenty of times including holidays (buffet) and my service was always nothing but excellent. Super friendly and very attentive, cant ask anymore for an eating experience.   ps   The food is always better than expected for very resonable prices....."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!! I am absolutely beyond happy with their service. I originally went to another restaurant in the area only to find they were closed. I decided to go over to Red Rocks for dinner. My heart was set the ENTIRE day on the other restaurants fried pickles. I asked the waiter here and sadly they did not have any on their menu. Moments later one of the managers Kristen came out to my surprise with a bowl of fried pickles. (I could hear the angels singing in the background.... ) Even though the item was not on the menu they went out of the way to brighten the remainder of my day! I'm so thankful and blessed. I'll definitely be back! Great food, EXCELLENT service and staff!!! P.S. if you guys decide to add fried pickles to the menu please name them after me Mirisha's Fried Pickles....."}
{"text":"I like to go here every year with my lunch bunch for my birthday!! The service has always been great. The food is out of this world! The dishes are mostly named after local celebrities and notable people in the community. I recommend the she crab soup. If your looking for a recipe straight from low country itself, this bowl will not disappoint. They even add just the perfect touch of sherry. The menu is very large, plenty of choices for everyone. They are known for their desserts as well and don't let the price tag fool you......I ate on my piece of cake for probably four days!! I hope to see you soon Red Rocks!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. Great location and atmosphere.  The food is beautifully prepared and consistently good. My favorite salad is the blue cheese wedge. The portions are well sized.  The service is excellent which tops off a great dining experience."}
{"text":"The best!  Friendly, tasty and great atmosphere!  We come here all the time"}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice now; our go to place in birkdale village. The filet mignon Oscar style was incredible, the second go round of salad and chowder was great too. Maybe a little too pricey, but the connivence of being able to pop in after a movie or shopping makes it worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the pleasure of dining there on our 6 year anniversary and it was absolutely amazing.  The food was terrific!  I had the famous lobster ravioli and he had the filet with lobster.  Everything was perfect!  The staff was great and our server was there for everything we needed.  Drinks were constantly filled and he never missed a beat.  I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a great meal, friendly staff and cool atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We had the crab dip as an appetizer and it came in a bread bowl which was awesome. I saw one lady eating it by herself as an entree. I had the Chicken Piccata and the fella had the salmon. No complaints. They bring out a dessert tray which is always fun. The 15,000 Layer (an estimation) Chocolate Cake was huge and very tasty. We were spontaneously celebrating and the vibe in the area near the bar was nice. The waitress was a little over-attentive, but she mellowed out as the night went on- and I can't really complain about over-attentiveness."}
{"text":"The food is great! Is it worth the money? My steak sandwich was $16 with only 3.5 oz of meat, I cut my bread in half so it felt like a real sandwich. The horseradish sauce was missing prepared horseradish it tasted like plain mayo. The crab cake and wing appetizers were very good."}
{"text":"Went to RR on Monday evening and even though the place wasn't very busy at 7:00 I was very pleased with the quality of the food and service. I would give the place 5 stars but the dessert was very lack-luster, almost tasted like it had been frozen and thawed(had a strange freezer-burnt texture). I will still return since this place consistently delivers a great experience."}
{"text":"This place is great. This was our first time here at this location. I ordered the blackened mahi and it was delicious. I ordered a chaser salad and it was fine not my favorite but still good. My wife ordered the jumbalaya and she said it was the best she has ever had. We also ordered the Oreo cheese cake which was delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone. We ordered a bottle of wine which was reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is one of the best restaurants in the area. I have to be honest. I frequent it regularly, but for good reason.  The food is obviously really good and the portion sizes are good, but not overwhelming.  The staff is very friendly and always makes sure that you are happy.  The atmosphere is just fun place to go for food and drinks with friends and family.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Ordered the lobster ravioli on Foodie Call. I essentially paid $19 for 4 small pieces of ravioli, two shrimps and a few scallops all of which were buried in cream sauce. If you like being ripped off, this is the place."}
{"text":"I truly feel Red Rocks is a staple restaurant in Charlotte. I order something new every time I go and have not been disappointed. The prices may seem a little pricey but the ingredients and their portions match up with the price. They have the same environment as any other high end restaurant but you don't pay big bucks for a kid size meal. Bartenders and waiters are always on point and very friendly. Don't leave without their chocolate cake!   Weatherly Cajun Salmon- HIGHLY RECOMMEND  Blackened Tuna- Nice thick slices  Lobster Ravioli- Very Rich & Creamy  Cajun Chicken on a Croissant All their steaks are great, whoever grills them up really know what they're doing, never had an under or over cooked steak.  Really great ranch dressing (For those who are like me that are really particular with Ranch)  Last night they have a Caramel Balsamic Reduction sauce that paired so well with their steak. *drooling as I type* Pittsburg Salad- Nothing better than an unhealthy salad!  Moscow Mule with extra lime- LOVE IT HERE"}
{"text":"Like the restaurant, but had a bad experience last time. Got the ribs, which are extremely good, and ordered double slaw instead of fries. The slaw had turned rancid, quite bad, so I returned it. Waitress said chef was opening other slaw containers to see how wide spread the problem was, offered a different side. I picked Mac and cheese. It was really amateurish, not good at all, no reason to eat it. No apology for the rancid slaw, which would have been appropriate. So, today we went again. I wanted to try the ribs again, but looking at the sides, and of course leery of the two from the last meal, I gave up and had the chopped salad with filet, which was great. My observation is that some of the items on the menu seem dated and not up to the level of most of the menu. I recommend updating the sides and some of the appetizers, bring them up to the same quality as the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Have eaten here for lunch two times.  The first time it was a early spring day and beautiful.  I wanted to eat outside but walking up to the restaurant we noticed how crowded it was.  My husband suggested we eat inside, he was pretty hungry and didn't want to wait for a talble outside.  We were one of the only tables inside, our waiter was great, even though we knew he was bored he didn't hover over us as we read over the menu, but he was close by if we had any questions.  We ordered the parmesan potato cakes to start, they were good, my husband really liked them.  I thought they had great flavor but I didn't like the mashed potato texture.   Then the She-crab soup was excellent, best I had since I lived in Charleston(years and years ago).  I had the wedge salad with filet tips... what isn't good about blue cheese, beef and bacon.  I think that was a special because on our second trip I did not see it on menu.  My husband had one of the Burgers and said it was one of the best burgers he ever had.    On our second trip it was a cloudy rainy day so again we sat inside.  Again the service was great, friendly and helpful.  It is a bit dark on the inside but you can see everyone at your table so there isn't too much a complaint there.   Food again, delicious and prepared to our liking.  I had crab cakes which were great!  Also in our group the Buffalo shrimp were throughly enjoyed.  One person had the southwest chicken ravioli and they said that they were good.   I would like to return again and be able to sit outside and people watch!"}
{"text":"We went here because Bonefish had over an hour wait and Red Rocks has good reviews... Maybe we had a bad experience but the food was not good. I agree with other reviewers that the food is overpriced for what you get. My husband and I both had a surf n turf with filet and crab cake. The crabcake was the worst I've ever had! I'm from Florida and lived in DC so I know what a crab cake should taste like and it was all filler. And not good. The steak was comparableto outback but with a much bigger price tag. Our server was also very obnoxious trying to oversell bottles of wine and add ons to the steaks and more. We each had a glass of wine, no desserts and no apps it was over $100 for 2 of us and not worth it at all. The atmosphere is very chain-like and not upscale, the table next to us had loud children and were eating burgers... Maybe that's the way to go here? I might give them one more chance because we live close but steer clear of the crab cake and steaks."}
{"text":"Best thing about Red Rocks? The diversity of the menu. For being only two pages, there's a pretty large selection and the choices are rather eclectic. Comfort food, Italian food, seafood, vegetarian, lots of salads, and even some pretty casual, but fancy sandwiches.  The atmosphere is nice. It's fancy enough so that I feel inclined to wear a dress instead of yoga pants, ha. I love the drum shade lighting and all the booths. I just wish the decor had a little more personality, to give it less of a \"chain restaurant\" look.  The smartest thing the owners do is entice you with dessert before you even eat, by having all their fresh baked good on display as you enter. Remember how good those look as you walked in, but you're too stuffed to have anything else now? Good luck with that will power... After you finish your meal, the waiters bring out a tray with a slice of each cake on display. They describe in detail each piece. Yeah, I can never resist. So I usually get a piece to take home.  My favorite dishes here?  Appetizers: Parmesan Potato Cakes, Queso-Spinach Dip, and the Homemade Potato chips. I guarantee you won't be disappointed by any of these!   Salad: Small Baby Field Greens (pine nuts, goat cheese and craisins.. YES!)  Pastas: Walnut and Spinach Ravioli, and Quarto Fromaggio Penne (minus the meat of course)  Sandwiches: Portabella Mushroom Melt  FYI: It's much nicer and quieter here on a week day/night. Sometimes the weekends can be crowded and annoying.   Would probably come here more if the prices were just a bit lower."}
{"text":"I've had two good experiences at this restaurant. Both times I was talked into having dessert, they are particularly delicious. Giant pieces of cake, one order is defiantly enough for two. The appetizers are very memorable as well, the buffalo calamari is the best I've had. Strangely the entrees have been forgettable to me, the best options are probably too expensive for me to try. :-) Atmosphere is dim and intimate, great for couples. When I met my family for a birthday, I felt like we were being way too loud. Service has always great, you feel like you're there to be taken care of, especially when it comes to dessert. And the manger is always on the move in the dining room checking on guests."}
{"text":"I have not eaten here in years but on a whim, my friend and I decided to lunch here for my birthday. The menu is varied , lots of selections and appetizers. We were disappointed not to have gotten a booth as they are way more spacious ---had a tiny little table against a wall and very cramped during the entire lunch. I have no issues myself with the food---I ordered a pasta dish, chicken and penne in a four cheese sauce with mushrooms and tomatoes. It was very tasty. My friend ordered a Kobe beef burger and had asked the server if she could substitute the soup of the day , broccoli and cheese, for a side. The server was glad to oblige and said sure you can. So her meal arrives and on the plate is a cup of chicken noodle soup instead. My friend summons the waitress and says \"I did order the broccoli cheese, did I not?\". She responds, Oh, they ran out!  Now folks, don't you think it would have been prudent to tell my friend beforehand that the soup she wanted was gone and not just bring any old thing?  So, the server does ask if you want to take it back and get something else. By that time , the other food was getting cold and she told her to not bother. Here is the kicker, though---when the bill arrived , she was charged $2.00 for the soup!! Why the server did not alert her before hand as to the extra charge, I can't imagine but she did have an obligation to say something. Rather than complain again , she decided to say nothing and pay for it. Wrong!! I wanted to make mention of this to the server and the management.  Not good business people , bringing out a food item you did not want in the first place and then charging you for it. You can do better than that, I am sure."}
{"text":"Ah, Red Rocks. What can I say? You're a Cotswold institution. Been around forever with your overpriced mediocre everything. You're going nowhere because you're too convenient to ignore.   But today, I received a pleasant surprise. Ordered a dinner entree for lunch. (How you prep your kitchen for the entire menu is beyond me.) Ordered the Almond Crusted Grouper. And although the presentation looked odd, and the fish was a bit overcooked, the flavors were excellent.   Bartender even pulled off great and friendly service. And, I do always love the greetings at the door. Like you're genuinely glad I'm there. Being an ex industry girl, I know you're staff has \"issues\" - but I didn't see it today, and I didn't taste it today.   So...kudos. And, yes, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dinning here recently to celebrate my grandparents 71st wedding anniversary and my mawmaws 90th birthday. The service was impeccable, they didn't skip a beat. I can't say enough about the quality of food! I actually worked at this location for a few years almost a decade ago so I can definitely vouch for the amazing owners, the attention to detail and the love that is put into the food. To come back with family after all these years and see that all those qualities have been kept intact speaks for itself. This is a local restaurant that I'm so happy Charlotte has! It's a true gem that should not be missed! If you want top notch food with top notch service at a locally owned restaurant then you should definitely stop by and see John Love and his team at the Rock! \"The steak cuts like butter\""}
{"text":"Dined here last night with some friends and we were all disappointed. Service was great as the lady who waited on us (we were seated in bar area) was super nice and knowledgable. It was the food that was just bland and nothing I would go back for unfortunately. Staretd with three appetizers - calamari (VERY tasteless and just chewy strips of nothing), seared tuna (ok, tuna was fresh and seared well, but no seasoning and served with store bought seaweed salad and soy sauce), and potato cakes (these were ok, nothing great and nothing bad). I had the grouper with the wild rice risotto, asparagus, and a sauce. It was a nice portion as far as size is concerned, but lacked any flavor. Others had a steak sandwich (she said it was ok), dual filet medallions (she said they were ok), chicken withy vegetables (again ok), and the tuna with the soy broth (broth was good). We ended with the coconut cake and peanutbutter pie. The desserts were the best part of dinner. This is unfortunate because Red Rocks use to be pretty good, but since reopening after the fire the food leaves a lot to be desired. I'll not be coming back here; there are more places I want to spend my money on a nice dinner (especially at their price point)."}
{"text":"My Aunt introduced me to Red Rocks several years ago and it quickly became my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  I don't make it to this location as much as the other one in Southpark, but my Aunt wanted to take my husband and me to dinner the weekend before Christmas to celebrate since we would not be together for Christmas.  She originally suggested the Melting Pot, but I told her I would rather go to my favorite!  My aunt made us reservations, but we still had to wait 15 minutes or so for a table.  It's not like they could do much anyways as you could see they were crazy busy.  Once we were seated, we ordered some wine and drinks as well as asked for the complimentary bread.  You have to ask for the bread, it is not automatically given to you, but it is good light bread!  We did have to wait a little bit, but our food finally came - and they were all warm!  My aunt got her normal - chicken marsala, Kevin got his usual - Quattro Formaggio and I got my usual - Cajun Chicken Pasta.  I have tried to deviate from my favorite, but it is too hard to go away from it.  Their other food is great (love getting bites of everyone elses), but this is just my favorite - it is pasta, with a great tomato cream Cajun sauce with sausage, chicken, veggies and cheese!  This time they went a little too tomato chunk heavy, but otherwise it was just as good as it always is.  Great thing is that it is plenty of food and there are leftovers for another night!  We also end with dessert.  My favorite that I get every time is the oreo cheesecake.  It is creamy and fabulous!  We also got the peanut butter pie and that was pretty good as well, nice light and fluffy dessert.  I see others have not liked this place based on the reviews, but I love it and have never had any issues when going here. Red Rocks needs to come down to the South side (further south than Southpark), maybe not though since I would need to eat there too often! :)"}
{"text":"The service and food have always been great.  They have a large menu which sometimes make it difficult to choose.  Some of our favorites have been the southwest chicken raviolis and the lobster raviolis.  Their desserts look amazing and finally gave in and took home a piece of key lime pie on our last visit that was delicious.  They take reservations on open table which is great because it has been very busy every time we have been there."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in charlotte!  My aunt introduced me to the one in Huntersville, so I've been to that one plenty of times.  I have also been to this one quite a few times with my boyfriend or with friends.    I have never had a problem with service at either location.    I have had quite a few different dishes, chicken marsala (my aunts favorite), burger, ravioli, but the one dish I always come back for is the cajun chicken pasta.  This has to be my favorite pasta anywhere!  Love the sauce, having chicken and sausage, vegetables, and of course cheese!  I've gotten to the point, that's all I can order, but they have plenty to choose from.  Kevin loves their saltimbucca!  My last visit earlier this month was with some girlfriends.  They asked about bread, and they offer it on an as ask for basis.  I've never asked for it, so it was news to me.  The bread is just as good as the rest of their food, it is very soft and light.  They of course have plenty of desserts.  I love the oreo cheesecake!  Overall, this is in my top 3 of favorites here, can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"I've been to red rocks many times, and I've always left feeling like the food was sub par. Well this time was totally different, it was excellent.   We started with the buffalo Calamari. This interested me because I had never seen it before and it was excellent. Good portion size and very tasty.   I had a New York strip with a potato pancake and mashed potatoes. I wanted blue cheese crumbles on my steak, but forgot to order it. The waitress came back around a few minutes later and I asked if she could bring some blue cheese crumbles on the side as I know it is hard to add something on it after it is already entered in the POS. Yet they put it on the steak, and I was happy about that.   The service was very good all around. The four of us shared a strawberry shortcake cheesecake and an Oreo cheesecake, and they were very good. They looked like the same desserts that Epic Chophouse has, which I thought was interesting.   The menu is a little too big and could be condensed some. When I asked the waitress what her favorite thing was, she listed just about everything on the menu. Other than that, it was a really good experience with great food. Very pleased."}
{"text":"My date and I decided on Red Rocks Cafe as we both enjoy seafood.  We both ordered the Chilean sea bass and it was average at best.  It wasn't properly seasoned - really lacking in salt - nor was it flaky.  A really good Chilean sea bass should be cut with a fork and have a rich, buttery taste.  This was neither.  We ordered wine and found lipstick on the rim of my glass.  The manager did deduct this from my bill and apologized.  The service was really good and the waiter was very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"The potato pancakes app was excellent and the artichoke queso dip was well above average. Our party had the half rack of ribs, lobster tail dinner, ravioli, salmon special with bacon risoto, and sesame Ahi Tuna, and everyone was pleased with their meals. We will be back the next time we're there visiting family in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to dinner last Saturday night, (we didn't have a good experience the last time we were there. The owner emailed me to further discuss our poor experience. I told him, we'd come back, and give Red Rocks another chance,and I am so glad we did).  The food and service was excellent. We had Stacy as our server, as she was great!! we ordered the calamari,which is always so good. We also had wine, beer, salads and my husband said the jambalaya was the best he ever had. We were so happy that we came back, and would recommend the restaurant to all of our friends. We will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"Once again Red Rocks did not let me down! Will took me right to my table and the evening went as well as I expected.  The Cajun salmon was exceptional and I will suggest this dish to everyone if you like a little spice.  The service was fantastic as usual because I have learned not to presume anything less from the staff. It was so good I am planning a business lunch there next week!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there for the first time yesterday. Enjoyed sitting outside. Great service and excellent food. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Excellent Pittsburgh salad! We all enjoyed our lunch--I had never had a salad with beef and french fries! The generous portion was a filling lunch salad with beef, hard boiled eggs, mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumbers and I selected cherry vinaigrette, which added a sweet contrast to the beef. The combination was unique and flavorful! My husband had a great chop salad and enjoyed it. The service was professional and courteous! I liked the look of the desserts but we were full so save it for next time. Parking is in the lot adjacent to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Typical mediocre American food. Menu covers a lot of bases. Food wasn't bad, but it was nothing exceptional and I would only recommend this place if you lived nearby and didn't want to drive further. Prices were fine - neither high or low. Service was friendly but at times the waiter dissapeared. I think he also forgot about my soup until I reminded him.  The she-crab soup was very rich and as another reviewed commented, decadent.  We ate at M5 the previous night and I'd go there again and again, but I would not go here again and again."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 - The food is truly delicious. I have had everything from salad to chicken to steak to cheesecake, and it does not disappoint. The flavors are spot on and the portion sizes are reasonable.  Service: 4/5 - Lunch time service here is great, but dinner time is a little slower, though not bad!  Atmosphere: 4/5 - Unless you are on the patio or in the bar area, the atmosphere lacks character. You can definitely tell you are in a strip mall, but it is decorated and lit nice enough."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating here tonight. First, i should mention there was over 50 prom goers eating there tonight. SO THEY WERE SWAMPED. Staff killed it. Almost no wait. Everything we all ordered was incredible (chips, tuna, wings apps were all amazing. Salads as entrees, one of us added shrimp, the other steak). All great. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Coming down for a visit from CT I found this whole neighborhood to be very charming. The waitstaff and service was great and they had a nice wine selection but 2 out of the 3 dishes we ordered was meh. The bruschetta wasn't quite right and the tomatoes didn't taste fresh at all. The buffalo calamari was cooked well and had lots of flavor but the shape had really thrown me off with long think strands and a more spongy texture. The chicken fingers were delightful though. Very light and not heavy deep fry taste. All in all a decent experience but maybe order dinner specials instead of sharing apps."}
{"text":"I've only been once, but it was a wonderful experience.  I had the NY strip steak and I had to say it was the best steak I've ever had.  I'm not a meat connoisseur, but I know what tastes good and this was very good.  The service was wonderful and the setting is very nice.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Red Rocks Cafe, nestled in South Park, offers an extensive menu of upscale American cuisine. The ambiance at Red Rocks is posh, yet relaxed and welcoming to families. I adore dining alfresco, and Red Rocks has a beautiful patio that allows their patrons to enjoy the southern weather during the spring, summer and fall.    We got off to a great start as Red Rocks impressed the kids by giving them a pirate sticker activity set that kept them content as we browsed the menu selections.  Once we settled in we realized that our most difficult task of the night would be choosing the winning entree. In my mind there were about five that were major contenders. The menu options are seemingly endless, and they all sounded amazing. They offer everything from burgers and salads to surf and turf, with many unique treasures in between.  We decided to try the Scott Andrew's Crab Cake Sliders ($12) as an appetizer - they were perfectly seared with a tangy dill mustard sauce. Their light flavor and full texture were taste-bud pleasing. Even little hands wanted to try these pint sized appetizers (as you can see in the photo!).  I shared the Cesar salad ($5) with my husband and S. The lettuce was fresh and crisp and the portion was large enough to share, but there was too much dressing for my liking. This was just a preference issue for me - because S thought it was perfection. I'd recommend asking for it on the side if you are 'dressing sensitive' like me, because it was a great tasting dressing.   S wanted fettuccine alfredo - do you sense a theme here with her dinners? The kids menu only offered marinara pasta, but the waitress let us know that they could easily swap out the marinara for  alfredo, and S was content with her favorite cream sauced entree.  E tried their burger, as did I, and it was juicy and tender. His latest obsession is ketchup (aka life blood as we call it) and he enjoyed dunking each piece of burger and french fry into his favorite condiment. I appreciate a restaurant that offers entrees that the kids will eat - and not complain about! Dining out should be a fun experience and picky kids with limited menus can pose a problem, luckily there was no such problem at Red Rocks.  Our patient, and attentive waitress visited our table and explained their specials and tried to help me narrow my top five to just one. Ultimately I ended up ordering the Eugene Robinson's Shrimp and Scallop Fresco ($18). I'm a fan of seafood, artichoke and sun dried tomatoes, and together they were served up together as a savory medley. The entire dish was tasty, but the scallops were phenomenal.  Jim's take: I enjoyed the crab cake sliders and Cesar salad. For my entrée, I settled on Barry Giller's Blackened Tuna Avocado ($23).  It featured two good sized portions of seared sushi grade tuna over a bed of red risotto, grilled asparagus, avocado, and pico de gallo.  The tuna was a little spicy (which is a good thing to me) and the accompaniments complemented it very well. For dessert we had the chocolate cake, which was three delicious layers of chocolate cake and frosting. This was a major crowd pleaser.   We didn't sample anything from the wine menu, but next time we visit without the kiddos I'll have to enjoy a glass of one of their many wines.  I was thoroughly impressed with the entire staff, one waitress even stopped by and asked if she could clean off the tidy tray that we bring with us everywhere that E had used. Our server was attentive and able to anticipate the needs (more napkins, don't put the drink in front of the baby etc.) of our family without fail. The restaurant was well appointed, clean and the bathrooms had the ever needed changing table in the women's room. Parking was a breeze and they take reservations (always a bonus when dining with the little ones).  Red Rocks Cafe has two locations, the one in South Park and then a second location in Huntersville in the Birkdale shopping center. You can like Red Rocks Cafe on Facebook, or follow them on Twitter.

{"text":"I was in town on business alone and saw this place on Yelp! I ate dinner on a Tuesday afternoon outside. I was seated immediately and everything was too me in perfect timing. I ate the lemon and herb pan seared chicken and it was great! Wish there were a little more potatoes and wish the potatoes were a little more flavorful, but the chicken was perfect. I'd def come back to try other options."}
{"text":"probably the best place to go for your money in birkdale. the food and service is always consistant. great cakes and pies for desert. always friendly faces greeting you as you walk in. they may actually have the best outdoor patio in all of the charlotte area. let me know if anyone knows of another great restaurant with a patio like red rocks. im not a huge chocolate cake fan but my friend tells me there chocolate cake is the best. it looks like a small chocolate mountain"}
{"text":"I love Red Rocks and I go often. I always have a great meal, and the service is always friendly and prompt. I love the chicken salad, the pasta and you can not beat the Red Velvet cake and the 5 layer chocolate cake. The specials are creative and overall I always leave happy."}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed in seeing the Meh reviews here for Red Rocks. I've been to both locations (this one the most) and have never had a bad experience. Last night I ordered the chopped salad and ribeye filet special smothered in horseradish cheese sauce served with roasted potatoes and creamed corn. Yeah, you can't put that on the Specials menu and expect me not to want it...  The food was very good and the service was even better. Our waitress was so excited to serve us that my date couldn't help but smile and comment on her vivaciousness.   The only thing that I regret was not ordering the chocolate layer cake for dessert. I've had it a couple times before and OMG is it delicious! It's honestly the best chocolate layer cake in Charlotte next to The Palm. It would be hard for me to have to choose between the 2.   All in all, I like Red Rocks and wish there were a location closer to me in Uptown. The menu is vast and reasonable. You can order a burger, sandwich, steak or seafood. The atmosphere is nice but a little casual. I suggest giving RR a go and don't forget to take a peek at their massive dessert tray!"}
{"text":"Consistent and nice option in the Southpark/Cotswold area. More simple items are some of their best."}
{"text":"I visited Red Rocks Cafe for a Sip n See Shower for a cousin...on a beautiful Saturday afternoon at Birkdale...along with a LOT of other people to enjoy the shopping and other offerings there.  Parking  and walking was no issue for me, but I would have not wanted to parallel park my big girl car (Chevy Suburban) along the streetside for sure!  We sampled the calamari, the spinach and artichoke dip, the tuna and avocado dip, the chicken fingers and one more appetizer I can't remember.  The calamari was standard, nothing to get too excited about.  The spinach and artichoke dip was pretty good, probably better than some.  The tuna and avocado dip caught me a little by suprise because I didn't know it ws tuna, but the bite I tasted was okay, but I wouldn't get it again.  The chicken fingers were pretty good thought the honey mustard sauce was not to my liking.    The service was fantastic and we had our own room so we had a pretty quiet area to host a shower.  I really like the quiet feeling of the restaurant amidst the hustle and bustle outside...  The menu seemd a tad pricey for the menu offerings, but everything we saw coming out looked yummy.  I would go back for sure and tried some entrees this time!"}
{"text":"Always great service and very consistent food. It's a hot spot for the NASCAR industry and a place I frequent as much as possible. Get the chocolate cake! You're welcome."}
{"text":"If there were a button for 3.5 stars, I'd click it. Red Rocks is good - but an older, somewhat dated Charlotte restaurant. You'll get solid food in a somewhat 'frozen in time' ambiance. It's good to have some 'middle of the road' choices around Charlotte so I'm glad to see RR still on the scene."}
{"text":"This place is in Birkdale Village, or as I like to call it, \"The Truman Show strip mall.\" Typical suburban food with an obvious electrical problem - It is , without a doubt the DARKEST place I've ever eaten. I think the owner must have gotten the \"conserve energy\" memo. I went to the bathroom and it took me 10 minutes to find my seat. I felt like Mr Magoo. I don't know about you, but I like to be able to SEE my food before I eat it. Do yourself a favor & go the Fox & Hound across the street. The food there is fine, plus , they paid their electricity bill."}
{"text":"An evening dinner, planned for 12 people with reservations at 8pm Friday March 4, 2016, never materialized as the manager did not seat us at 8pm - or even 20 minutes later. He allowed the table set up for us to keep the previous customers seated even after their bills were paid and service finished. He didn't ask them to leave, saying the table was needed for other customers. When reservations were made (much) earlier in the day, we were informed that the patio might be available and it was heated. The manager never asked us if we wanted the patio so we assumed it was closed. We won't be coming back any time soon - if at all. I will be writing up a review on Yelp/Charlotte. A most unfortunate evening and a loss of 12 customers."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and everyone's food at my table was just okay. Most of us didn't finish our meal due to lack of taste and or flavor. The presentation looked great it just lacked taste."}
{"text":"Food is good but WAY overpriced. Portions aren't big enough or creative enough to warrant the cost.   The base problem is that this place thinks it's fancier than it is. Wine selection ain't fancy but they try to pretend it is. Restaurant decor ain't fancy but they think it is. White tablecloths alone do not warrant $30 per person meals. Very dark inside. Like you're dining in a cave. Service is fine, I guess."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Service was so-so, but not terrible for a busy Friday night.  Food is a little over priced for what you get, but it has a nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"I have been here twice so far during holiday visits from California.    I like the fact that they have a full bar and the baby field greens salad is also good, especially with grilled chicken.   (Salmon is also an option)    The salad consists of spring greens topped with fresh goat cheese, roasted pine nuts (they were not roasted last time I was here), craisins, and served with balsamic vinaigrette.   The perfect size for lunch.   My dad liked his chicken salad sandwich and fries.  My mom's crabcake sandwich looked just ok.  Very pre-fab.  Service is pretty friendly...  can get VERY loud and busy on certain nights. Even the Xmas music was too loud when we were here at about 2pm on a Monday.  I'm all about a party but....   c'mon now.  I can't say that I\"d be running to go back here but there are a couple things on the menu that are okay."}
{"text":"Best service!  Chris, the GM, went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. Would completely recommend and will be back again!  Thanks for a great and memorable evening!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Red Rocks many times & find the food to be good but the service really can be hit or miss.  I have been on several occasions for dinner meetings, and the wait-staff for special events are normally on top of things.   On my last visit, we went in around 8:30 or 9 PM  to have beverages & appetizers. Now, Red Rocks would not normally be my first choice as a place to go just for drinks & appetizers... however, I had friends from out of town staying close by and they really like wine rather than beer or mixed drinks... so this was the closest place to them that offered a decent selection of wines by the glass.   Since we had a group of between 8 - 10 people, we told them that we didn't really want to eat dinner, but would like a table so we could order appetizers and drinks. The waiter assigned to our table was apparently not happy that we were not all ordering dinner (but, as it turned out, a couple of people in our party did order full meals).   But,  the service was the worst I have ever seen, and our server even left in the middle of his shift  and handed off our table to another server.  (Thankfully, she was much more gracious and attentive).   The appetizers were good -- we had the Artichoke & Crab Dip, Queso Spinach Dip, Buffalo shrimp and the guys ordered the Kobe sliders.  As usual, the quality of the food was good... I just wish the service had been better."}
{"text":"ALWAYS a treat and one of my favorite places to go. Ordered a pretzel burger and smashed potatoes; my hubby got a bowl of chili, chicken cordon blue wrap and sweet potato tots. All were delicious and fresh. Our waitress, Barbara was very pleasant and the lady bartender working this afternoon makes an incredible Long Island tea! We cannot wait to come back!  * It was so nice to finally be able to meet the manager, John, in person."}
{"text":"Full blown menu...SO many choices! I can't argue with that! While the rather upscale prices don't allow me to come here on a regular basis, I have had my share of birthday dinners here.  The wait staff are knowledgeable, attentive & friendly.  The atmosphere is casual & cozy. The drinks...SUPERB! They make a mean martini. :)  Also, for families, there IS a kids menu.  While a lot of the menu items are named after our local celebrities (nice touch I think!) Here are my fans:  - JOHNNY WELLS' SMALL SPINACH SALAD - MICHAEL WALTRIP'S FILET & CRAB CAKE - JIMMIE JOHNSON'S BLEU CHEESE FILET MEDALLIONS  They serve brunch on Saturdays & Sundays & it's a pretty decent offering of items. Have private rooms & they cater.  Want a special evening, go ahead & access their website for online reservations."}
{"text":"Can't say that I've been jonesin' to check out RR. Sure, it's a convenient location and easy lunchtime middle-ground for different professions. You can see the \"ladies who lunch\" crowd here or even the dude in his power suit ready to \"rock\" a deal with a client. Can't say you'll see too much wowing going on from the food perspective.   I came here for lunch with a friend since it was the most convenient location for both of us. Ended up ordering a salad with rare, seared tuna and the light balsamic dressing. I've been on a kick of lighter lunch options lately and Red Rocks' salad options fit the bill rather well.   Our server was....friendly, but seemed a little perturbed when we presented a coupon. Not a huge deal, but just something to keep in mind.   Would I go back? Sure. Am I rushing back to excavate the rest of the menu for something worthwhile? Nope."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Red Rocks Cafe. This weekend I met up with some friends from college in Charlotte, and we headed over to Red Rocks for dinner.   We sat outside on the patio, where we received excellent service from both of the waitresses outside. The manager even came around twice. I ordered a glass of Moscato, which arrived in a big, tall wine glass. Very refreshing. My friends were pleased with their mixed drinks.   The menu is large, and a bit overwhelming for those who have never been. For my meal, I ordered Chet Snow's Salmon. I was able to substitute garlic smashed potatoes for the wild rice with no problem. The dish came out beautifully. The salmon was placed upon the garlic smashed potatoes with the lemon dill sauce on top of the salmon. The green beans were placed to the side. The salmon was cooked very well, with a slight crust all around, but still tender inside. The lemon dill sauce complimented the salmon very well. The garlic smashed potatoes were excellent-not too salty or garlic-y. The green beans had been blanched I believe; they were bright green and cooked, but still retained that firm bite when you crunched into them.   Overall, the next time I'm in Charlotte, I wouldn't mind returning to Red Rocks Cafe."}
{"text":"Red Rocks is a great restaurant whether you're looking for a really nice dinner or a casual lunch. The food is fresh, so much better than the chains, and at a fair price. Try the pastas dishes, filet mignon, and seafood. They have a huge patio to eat on and the atmosphere inside and out is terrific- upscale without being pretentious. Ask for Ann Marie or Jenny. You will leave happy."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Menu is itemized by famous Nascar names which the boyfriend thought was kinda cool. I had the meatloaf and he had one of the chicken and veggie meals. Everything was great. A little pricey but definitely worth it. It's a cute place for date night and it's in Birkdale Village which is such a cute outdoor shopping center. P.S. Kasey Kahne walked right by us while eating our dinner :) fun!"}
{"text":"We went to Red Rocks for the Easter Brunch. Our server was very attentive and pleasant. The food was plentiful and very tasty. All in all, they made our holiday very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Excellent food - we have been here several times since moving to NC and I love it each time. I also love the location because you can incorporate coming to Red Rocks with a Birkdale shopping trip too. We live close and will be back plenty more times!"}
{"text":"I came here for a business lunch and it was a really good atmosphere for that setting. The staff was very friendly and provided exceptional service. One of my co-workers is gluten and dairy free and our server went above and beyond to remember to take the dressing off her salmon without being asked due to the dairy in it. I had the Asian salad which was good but a little boring. It definitely needs more crunch like little wonton strips. I would come back here and try some other things."}
{"text":"We were there on a very busy night, and the food and service were excellent. The coconut cake is amazing. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here only once, and tried only one dish, but it was pretty so-so. It was the spinach mushroom ravioli with chicken. The wine sauce was watery and had very little flavor. Everything was swimming in it. I think that impacted the entire dish, which seem otherwise to be well made.  I'd eat here again, though. It's a nice place with a very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Easter Brunch at Red Rocks Charlotte was fantastic. We made reservations for 11:45 and it was good that we did as the restaurant got pretty full. The brunch was buffet style, starting with breakfast items (bacon, scrambled eggs, pancakes, biscuits) and a salad. I didn't waste time with those! The remainder of the buffet included deviled eggs, garlic mashed potatoes, creamed corn, Mac n cheese, green beans (that were so delicious they cannot have been healthy!), four cheese pasta, lemon dill salmon, sliced ham, and a carving station for prime rib au jus. It was delicious and the price ($30) was reasonable.   The highlight, however, was the dessert table. Oh-Em-Gee. It was incredible. Cheesecake, assorted truffles, chocolate cake, carrot cake, tiramisu, banana pudding, berries n cream...amazing! I had not been to Red Rocks in awhile and this was a good reminder of why I used to go more frequently."}
{"text":"I visited my daughter at college and we decided to try Red Rocks for lunch. We both had an excellent meal with food to take home (she was especially pleased because she dislikes the typical dorm fare). I had a creamy shrimp/scallop combination on pasta which was very tasty and my daughter had lobster raviolis which she really enjoyed. For dessert, she had a red velvet cake and I had a peanut butter cheese cake, both large and scrumptious! I wasn't exactly planning on a $58 lunch plus tip, but there you go! Those large helpings did it but we enjoyed every minute of it. Kudos to our waiter Sam, who did a fantastic job as well."}
{"text":"This place has some amazing food. I had to take a star away because they gave my food away to a couple who literally had come in and say down for a few minutes.  Finally the waiter realized our food had been given away. Once I did get my food it was everything! I has steak with asparagus and lobster mac. Thee best...and a piece of chocolate cake to go."}
{"text":"Great menu variety. Vegetarian options. Wonderful steaks and seafood. Nice area to sit outside and valet in the evenings. Also a comfortable bar area if you just want drinks and something light. There is a great private room for parties but I'm pretty sure you have to sell a kidney to afford it. Service is always attentive and they even offered a free, warm chocolate chip cookie on my last visit."}
{"text":"We arrived at 5:30 pm for a 6:30 pm reservation.  The valet said no problem come on in and eat.  Then the hostess said: \"I'm sorry, but we have 1000 reservations tonight and we cannot seat you early.\"  I told her what the valet said and that they had already taken our car, so she sent someone out to speak with them and she seated us - in the cold corner of an outside room.  No ambiance for New Years but more importantly no heat.  After our food came out the manager came over to see how everything was.  I hadn't started on my food yet, but told him it was cold.  He stuffed napkins into the hole in the corner of the tent and said he would turn on the heat.  Honestly for $100 meal with no tip (no alcohol either) I've had much better.  The calamari was very standard without a lot of flavor.  We both ordered the filet and crab cake.  The filet was cooked medium (requested medium rare) and had little flavor. The crab cake was the right size and had lots of crab, but again little flavor - even with the sauce drizzeled on it.  The green beans had salt and you could taste it and they were good.  No dessert.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"Went here for Restaurant Week.  The she-crab soup was a-mazing!  All the rest of our meal was very good.  The only complaint I would have was about the pork tenderloin - it was a little too \"homey\" for me.  The atmosphere was nice.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Salads on the patio on a perfect weather day is the best. Birkdale has an amazing atmosphere to begin with. Grab a glass of wine, your favorite meal and people watch on a Sunday!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the patio is fabulous for people watching and a good view of Birkdale. Our server Alex went above and beyond to meet our standards. Highly recommend the Erin Crocker Mule! Will be back and soon!"}
{"text":"Great food and patio area! I recommend visiting on a weekend to enjoy live music from the squares while enjoying a nice cocktail My Ahi Tuna and asparagus were cooked perfectly, and the sesame sauce added a sweet kick to the overall dish"}
{"text":"ENVIRONMENT: There are lots of shops and restaurants to visit in this area, so I recommend giving yourself some time to walk around either before or after your dining experience.  STAFF: The staff was friendly and helpful. Our waitress, Jade, was great!  FOOD: We got the bruchetta as an appetizer, and it was amazing! The first adjective that came to my mind when I took a bite was fresh. My wife ordered a bowl of the she crab soup, which was just the right balance between salty, sweet, and meaty crab. She paired that with a mixed green salad and added ahi tuna. The tuna was very peppery, so if you're not into that, take note. I decided to wait until we get closer to the coast for seafood, so I got the California burger. It was pretty good, but I would recommend something more regional."}
{"text":"I have eaten twice at Red Rocks and both times were fantastic.  The outdoor cafe is located in the heart Strawberry Hill.  There is street parking as well as Valet parking.  There is a Little know parking deck in the block behind the cafe so no need to pay a valet, he is going to park your car there anyway.  The atmosphere is very laid back.  We went as a group.  The client tell is made up of a lot of locals on dates and the last time there we were graced by the presence of Daryl Waltrip and his entourage.  It was a nice evening and no it was not a madhouse.  Just business as usual.  Both nights I had the Fletwood's Sesame Tuna cooked rare.  an 8oz. sesame seared yellow fin tuna over wild rice risotto with asparagus finished with a ginger teriyaki broth.  Magnificent!  The drinks have a good amount of alcohol in them, the wine selection is very good and they have a very good selection of beer.  The only thing I would change are the outdoor chairs.  They need to be a little wider.  The wait staff are very nice and friendly.  Both our servers talked with us for a good amount of time between customers.  There are plenty of seats inside.  The bar area is designed for people to stand and talk as well as sit and eat.  Great transition between the cafe, bar area and main restaurant.  Not much I would change here.  If you are in the area check it out.  You feel like you are on a real main street.  And of course there are plenty of beautiful women to keep the conversation going.  I love the south!"}
{"text":"I would contact Red Rocks in a different manner if an Email was available.   I wanted to let them know about our experience last night which was far from stellar.  I called at 5:15 to request a 6:00 reservation and asked for a booth, I was told if one was available. When we arrived we asked for a booth and was told there were none available. We were taken to a table. It was obvious there were many booths available and most had couples who had not been served. I again requested a booth. After a consultation we were taken to a very small booth in the front which we could barely fit in. I again requested a larger booth and was told that was all that was available the others were reserved for other people. We could not reserve one. So we had to explain this to our hostess.She seemed a little perturbed but finally seated us at a larger booth just like everyone else was seated at. Frustrating.  We ordered lump Crab as an Appetizer and it was very good. We then ordered Blackened Grouper and Mahi Mahi. We split the dinner so we could each try the fish. Very very bland hardly any flavor, no sauce to help and the fish was hard to identify as being different. We had to send it back. We then went with steaks which we were told was their specialty. Blue Cheese medallions and the Grilled Ribeye. Again these were poor. The medallions were better than the Ribeye. The Ribeye again had no flavor and was very thin layed across some Garlic mashed potatoes. Had to cover it with Heinz 57 to get any flavor out of it. My wife took one bite and just shook her head. Her medallions were similar, thin and no flavor, she covered hers in Heinz 57. We did not mention the steaks to the waiter, we were too hungry by this point.   We ordered a Creme Brûlée which as very good.  Our experience was not very good, we eat at many restaurants and often, we critique the restaurants on many categories and this one fell well short. I don't mind paying if I feel satisfied when I leave. I left here feeling just the opposite.   Our Waiter was nice and the manager helpful, they just couldn't save the terrible food. We spent over $150.00 on dinner and tipped our waiter $35.00. But the price was terribly high for the very mediocre meal."}
{"text":"Went here for the second time.  Both times have been great from the food and ambience to the service and hospitality. Last night was exceptionally great. As I walked in the host was there opening the door greeting me with a warm smile, Janie at the bar was there to greet me immediately. She helped me make great selections. She was very friendly and knowledgeable. The general manager Chris stop by a couple times to ensure everything was great, which is a nice touch for a late night bar guest.  I'm in the industry and all I wanted was for someone to treat me like I treat people all day. I made a great choice by going there. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Charlotte for 1 week, and my first day I was blown away by my meal at red rocks! I had the lemon herb chicken with garlic mash and sautéed green beans! This meal tasted like you were visiting family that has not seen you in years and they cook all your favorites! I went back again on my last night in Charlotte, I didn't realize they were 10 minutes from closing. I felt horrible and was going to leave but everyone of the staff welcomed me in like I was their first customer of the day! This time I got the meatloaf w/ garlic mash and veggie medley. I've never had a more delicious meatloaf and it had marinara sauce instead of ketchup which I thought was AMAZING! The meat was so tender.. I finished my meal off with a piece of the most delicious and moist coconut cake I've ever had in my life! The thing that really stood out to me was the service was amazing & even 10 minutes before closing the meal tasted like they just opened. No sloppiness or leftover just throw on a plate so they could go home."}
{"text":"Reviews are misleading on Red Rocks. It reopened this summer after a fire last year. All new staff (pretty much). Place has really suffered. Service is ok but uninspired. My gf ordered a jalapeño margarita and it came with pickled jalapeños. Food was slow and mediocre. Place used to be a staple of Birkdale and Lake Norman. Sad."}
{"text":"I usually get pasta or salad here but decided to try the Caribbean salmon with pineapple chutney. Oh my goodness out of this world! My husband got the bacon wrapped sirloin, and it was so tender he was cutting it with his fork. So good."}
{"text":"This was such a disappointing meal.  I typically get the chopped salad which is good - nothing special but good enough.   I decided to try the portobello mushroom sandwich with risotto.   The sandwich was served on a cheap English muffin with no real flavor.  The risotto was just mushy cheesy wild rice.   I even questioned the server if it was really risotto - perhaps I got the wrong side.   He assured me it was.  Poorly prepared if it was.   When he took my plate he asked how it was and agreed \"it is kinda mushy\".   The service was good - the only reason I give it 3 stars.  Since I live nearby and go every so often with friends, I will stick with the salads.   Too many great restaurants in Charlotte to give my recommendation to Red Rocks."}
{"text":"Not as good as I was expecting. Just decent.. Our server was definitely pushy when it came to certain things. Paid in cash, said we needed cash back and she made it seem like we were finished and we had to ask for the change back.. She was nice though."}
{"text":"From Lemons to Lemonade! Long wait, great food and service. A hasty review needed to take back!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner on Saturday night at Red Rocks. The Thai Chili Mussels appetizer had been recommended to me by a friend who frequents Red Rocks for their delicious food and ambiance. The mussels were so tasty, cooked to perfection and paired so well with fries and toasted bread. I will definitely be back for this dish again! For my my entree, I ordered the Southern Citrus Seabass and my boyfriend enjoyed the Lobster Ravioli. Both delicious! Red Rocks has outstanding food, and friendly, attentive service. Drinks were refilled without asking. The owner even stopped by to welcome us and ensure we had outstanding service. We absolutely did, and will be recommending Red Rocks to anyone looking for a fabulous meal and experience! Absolutely 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Food and service is always superb. Wide selection of food from fish to steak and salads. Wine menu is also decent. Cheesecake is also awesome."}
{"text":"Finally made it taking our granddaughter out as part of grandparent day.  We were not alone in this as many other grandparents were doing same, but at 11:30am we were all promptly seated along with many regulars.  Super nice menu with lots of interesting offerings.  The kid menu ditto.  Out waitress, Cheryl, was so accommodating and on top of things that the meal became a friendly experience.  It took quite awhile to get our food, but it did come and was hot and correct.  The side salad was generous and we were glad that we ordered one to split.  The cajun chicken pasta, which I substituted shrimp, was in a spicy cream sauce and I was delighted to finish all of it.  Gosh was that good!  Wife had a spinach walnut ravioli which she liked enough to have wanted a larger portion.  Perhaps the dinner portion is more generous?  Although not a desert eater, granddaughter asked for key lime pie, selecting from one of those most dangerous trays containing at least six waist killing items.  Apparently they are known for their cakes, pies and pastries.  And now we know why.  The Military Officers Association of America frequently has meeting/dinners here and I think I will start attending.  It is a comfortable, classy, yet casual place for great lunches and dinners."}
{"text":"Just sat down to order and the burgers all have NASCAR driver names. The waitress had no idea what I was ordering because they always change the names. What is the point? Need to make a serious menu change so we know what we are ordering!"}
{"text":"Red Rocks is always the perfect go to for a delicious dinner. The service is outstanding and the food is excellent. It has great ambiance and is the most popular place to go in Birkdale. We bring out of town guests here and they are always impressed."}
{"text":"I've been going here since the place opened. NEVER had a bad meal. Crab cakes and chicken saltimbocca are the best. Great wine list and desserts."}
{"text":"I have a been a long time customer. The food is always good. They have you basic classic dishes. But they do a great job of adding new items and switching it up. I love the parmesan potato cakes. The classic wedge salad is a great go to.  They have some of the best desert in town. And the brunch! Man, it's a must."}
{"text":"I was visiting my aunt/uncle and cousins in NC for my birthday and my aunt said that we MUST come to Red Rocks and have the buffalo calamari.  Wow..  2 words.. buffalo calamari!  I have never had such perfectly fried, thick cut (I mean THICK -- have never ever seen such thick squid) and tender calamari ever! Not overly breaded and perfect amount of hot sauce (although the hot sauce was lacking the heat I love). Red Rocks should just rename themselves buffalo calamari and just serve that. They'd make a killing!  They also had a special Guinness Beer Cheese Soup. Wow. Friggin' awesome! I love soup.. I love beer and I love cheese, what a great combo. It was similar to like a broccoli cheddar chowder type of soup with beer flavor. (You can see it in the photos I've added).  I also had the special of the day - Flatiron Steak. It came with some garlic mashed potatoes and a delicate horseradish hollandaise sauce.  Some other family members had some awesome looking and tasting seafood pasta dishes and salmon steaks w/ risotto.  But if you ever find your self in Huntersville, North Carolina.. you must visit Red Rocks and have the most delicous buffalo calamari."}
{"text":"Fun place, TV's galore here!  When there isn't a \"big game\" on at night on the weekends they play music videos which surprisingly are fun to watch and the audio quality is great!  My only issue with this place is it tends to get a little unkempt when busy for lunch or dinner.  I don't like to see food and junk on the floor.  Buy a carpet sweeper and use it!"}
{"text":"Great for Sunday Brunch  We've eaten here several times for both Brunch and Dinner and have enjoyed outselves each time. Last Sunday was no exception.  Cold and Wet but the restaurant was warm and cozy.  My wife order the Bison Meatloaf with the Soup of the day and a White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake for dessert.  I had the Sea Crab Soup for my appetizer and Fish and Chips for my entree.  Everything was excellent and the Sea Crab Soup outstanding. The best I've had this side of Charleston.  Service was impeccable and the ambiance is rich and full.  A great dining experience."}
{"text":"I would recommend Red Rocks. Nice ambiance. Waiter was very attentive to care for refills. Had the Ribeye. Nicely cooked and tender."}
{"text":"This is your typical nice American restaurant.  They have sandwiches and entrees like steak and pasta.  The food is ok, and can be good, but it's been hit or miss for me and the prices are a little high.  I have always really enjoyed their Iceburg Wedge Salad.  In my quest to find the best chicken salad in town, I rate their's as ok, but certainly not in the running for the best.  My boyfriend likes the Southwestern Ravoili.  In prefer Harper's for this kind of food."}
{"text":"When I lived pretty much across the street I would come here more often.  But since I moved I hadn't been in years and the only reason I did go back was so my nephews could have breakfast with Santa before Xmas.  I have to say it wasn't too bad.  It was a buffet for like $15 pp and that included a non alcoholic beverage.  Our server was really great and she even offered to take pics of our whole fam for us.  The food was very decent for a buffet, lots of fresh fruit, biscuits, pancakes, eggs.    Santa was a little different then what we've seen elsewhere, my 3 y/o nephew had no issues with him but the 6 y/o was like uh uh, that looks nothing like Santa I don't want to sit on his lap, ouch!!  Overall I have never left Red Rocks and thought, wow what an amazing meal, but on the other hand I have also never left and though, ew that was awful."}
{"text":"I decided to take my mom to Red Rocks for her Mother's Day lunch and it was by far one of the best culinary experiences I have had recently.  It was a beautiful day out and the patio was the perfect spot to enjoy a glass of wine and take in the sights of people wandering between the farmers market stands.    We both got the spinach salad with hot bacon dressing - the order was a small salad, but it would have been enough as an entree.  We decided to split the crab cakes and jumbo crab meat appetizer and both were nothing short of a little piece of seafood heaven.  The crab cake appetizers was small and for those with a hearty appetite or more than two people, it will definitely not fill you up.  However, they were delicious.  Fortunately, if you want a larger portion, they do offer a crab cake sandwich as well as an entree.  The bruschetta is one of my go to appetizers - the balsamic reduction is reason enough to order.  The menu is plentiful in its offerings and if you can, try and save room for dessert.  If not, you will be kicking yourself when you leave and pass by the dessert counter.  This is atmosphere is wonderful whether you sit inside or out.  However, on a nice day, I highly recommend the patio.  The servers are friendly and attentive and the orders come out in a timely fashion and allow you to enjoy your drinks in between.  I usually come here for special occasions because I know I won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went here for a special night with a dear friend. I used to live in Birkdale Village and always had a so-so experience here. I have not been here in over two years. This time was pleasant. Our waitress was very attentive and kept our drinks refilled and up sold us on the specials. I got the angel hair pasta with scallops with artichokes and it was outstanding. I also got the buffalo shrimp as an app and it was great too. The best part of the meal was the chocolate cake and the Oreo cheesecake - yum yum!!   Red Rocks has redeemed themselves in my mind and I will not hesitate to go back this time."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the buffalo shrimp. Had it here two years ago and have been raving about it ever since. Normally, when i build something up like that it usually lets me down upon my return. Not this time, even the special lady friend loved them. We bought them to share with the table, but ended up eating them all ourselves.   The lobster ravioli and jambalaya were both good. The jambalaya didn't look how i expect jambalaya to look, and the rice was kind of sparse, but the flavor was very good.   Overall i think the cost of the dinners was borderline too high, but it is worth a visit every once in awhile (especially for the buffalo shrimp)."}
{"text":"I really liked my Red Rocks experience and I would definitely return and recommend it to others. I do agree with other reviewers who said that the meals are overpriced, however, all the food we ordered was excellent and the service was exceptional.   My picky date mulled over his order and discussed options with our awesome waiter (hey Jonathan!) and settled on the Quattro Formaggio -- which is super delicious but rather heavy. (No complaints from him because he's carbo loading for a 15 mile training run).   I had the pork chop which was SUPERB. The side of sweet potatoes almost makes the dish worth it on its own.   For dessert we got carrot cake and peanut butter pie. Both were sugary perfection.   Jonathan stayed and chatted with us after the meal was done. The vibe was nice and the service was super friendly. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Red Rocks Cafe is a great place to eat when in Birkdale. The menu is eclectic with steaks, fish, appetizers and deserts. I really enjoy the blacked salmon.  As for drinks, I usually enjoy a martini, followed by a nice glass of wine from the excellent by the glass wine list.  The food is reasonably priced and the service is prompt and courteous. Will keep going back when in town."}
{"text":"The service was excellent.  Dessert great.  However the soup was tiny portion and the Caesar salad was just poor quality.  Was just like bottom of a store bought salad bag, wilted few croutons , no flavor at all. I would expect that a simple Caesar salad would be quite good at such a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"We live nearby and would normally give Red Rocks a five star.  However, after getting undercooked salmon (times two) they have lost a space in our heart.  The outside dining is very casual and charming.  The food, as indicated, has always been very good.  Salads are also outstanding.  However, please check and make sure that when fish is ordered medium well that it does not come out medium."}
{"text":"Steak undercooked.  Threw it back on the grill and brought the same plate back out.  Now cooked to medium-rare but tough.  Rest of the food was just okay, nothing to go back for.  Used to dine here years ago, however has obviously fallen off in food quality."}
{"text":"Wow the quality has gone way down in the past few years. This is the first time I've been in for three years or so and my girlfriends and I were really underwhelmed with the food.   They had Reubens and I had the Kobe beef burger. The server asked how I waned it cooked. I said medium rare and even said \"hot pink center.\" When the burger came out it was well done. Since it was still juicy I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it, but when she came back she asked if all was good. I mentioned it and she offered to have the kitchen try again. We weren't in a hurry so I said sure.  The second burger came out and was exactly the same, well done. She came back by and I told her not to worry, because it was still juicy. But it is weird to see a kitchen unable to hit close to a basic temp check.  The spinach dip was not great, tasted microwaved and not very fresh. The Reubens were good but greasy, and our side salads were just okay. Especially since they charged $4 for it even tho we replaced our side dish with it, was expecting a 2 or maybe 250 up charge for something so simple.  The Bloody Mary was great, and the server was a sweetie.   The manager really needs to learn not to interrupt when a table is talking, apologizing after completely jumping in the middle of a sentence not once but two separate times did not endear him to us. Appreciate a manager dropping by but this one had an attitude and really has a problem with social cues.   With so many other restaurants in Birkdale alone, we won't be back. Guess Red Rocks is on its way out."}
{"text":"My medium cooked NY strip was over cooked and dry with no flavor.  My sautéed greenbeans had absolutely no flavor.  And the garlic mash potatoes  were so dry they crumbled under my fork.  Horrible meal and I never plan to return.  For great steak at same price go to Epic Chophouse in downtown  Mooresville."}
{"text":"Good service and the ambiance is great too.  They could use a few more lightbulbs, but overall nice looking place.  Stopped in for lunch today and had the Pittsburgh salad.  It was yummy, the beef had a slightly sweet tang to it like teriyaki style or something.  I was a strange yet really good with the blue cheese dressing and the fresh veggies.  The drink was also on point...a Tahitian something or other.  We finished off with the coconut cake.  It was yummy.  I wish the day had been better, it was grey and rainy.  Birkdale is always a nice little afternoon, but we were in and out due to the crummy weather.  I knocked off a point for price.  My lunch was 32 bucks...The dessert portion was huge, but the salad was not."}
{"text":"I was super disappointed with Red Rocks Cafe. Most of the reviews I read were great but my experience, not so much. Went for brunch and the menu was pretty limited for brunch, but anyways I ordered the crab cake Benedict and my eggs were severely overcooked, they were hard boiled when they are supposed to be runny. I hadn't had eggs Benedict in a while, and I was looking forward to a real breakfast, so I was pretty disappointed and not to mention there was barely any hollandaise sauce which is the best part. I ordered grits and got fruit when my plate came, no big deal mistakes happen when I did get my grits they were cold, lumpy, sticky and flavorless. The only good part about it was the fresh fruit and the crab cakes were decent. Overall I would not go here for brunch again, maybe for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"First time at Red Rocks even though I have passed the restaurant several times shopping at Birkdale and have heard great things for a long time. It was restaurant week so I was able to try a few things. Appetizer I got the Caesar salad, which was good nothing special but the significant other got the She Crab soup which was amazing !! It just needed oyster crackers. Dinner we had the surf and turf and the herb baked chicken. The surf and turf was great ! The shrimp was great size and grilled perfectly and the filet was cooked perfectly as well! Very tender and the sauce was great as well. The herb chicken was flavorful and very tender but steamed vegetables were plain. Dessert we had the chocolate peanut butter cake, it was very good even though I'm not a chocolate cake fan. Wish I could've tried the red velvet cake in the dessert display. The atmosphere was very nice and intimate and the waiter was really great ! I can't wait to come back and try the normal menu ! Maybe the Danica Patrick Salmon !!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate at Rock Rock Cafe for the first time last night.  Our waitress Ashley Williams was amazing.  She was extremely patient, courteous and prompt with each aspect of our order and the delivery of service throughout the night was impeccable.  It's rare to find an employee who exudes professionalism and a willingness to go above and beyond to ensure that the customer leaves with a smile on their face and in their hearts because of the experience that was provided during a meal.  Thank you, Ashley you have a special gift.  In closing, I would be remiss not to mention that our food was exceptional too.  Please share this recognition with Ashley.  Employees should be recognized and celebrated when they exceed expectations."}
{"text":"Great night spot Great food Good Service Located in Birkdale Village- Free Valet too! You may find yourself eating next to a NASCAR drive here...outdoor seating is great in the summer time!"}
{"text":"Ever since we moved to the area in April, everyone has been telling us we should try out this place.  So finally we did while we had family in town.  The food was soooo good!  I had the southwest chicken ravioli and my husband had the sea bass.  They were both great! The ravioli had a great flavor to it and the sea bass had a surprising sweetness to it that put it over the top!  The rest of my family loved it too, no complaints at all about the place.  The waiter was really funny and was very easy to talk to.    Now the only thing that was annoying was the traffic around the circle, there were these young kids that were driving around with their bass turned up way to loud and there was the occasional motorcycle.  If any of these things bother you I would recommend indoor seating."}
{"text":"We decided to pre plan for Saturday night so we made reservations on \"open table\" for two. We were escorted to our table after check in. However, it was a tiny table for two. We did not complain about the size of the table. However it was a little uncomfortable. My husband is 6'3  he didn't have much arm space.  After ordering wine and appetizers. The booth was cleared next to our table. One of the managers that were on duty asked if we would like to move over the the vacant both.  Alexis are waitress was very pleasant and very knowledgeable of menu items.  Our table was visited by two managers checking in to see how our dining experience was going. Great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Was looking for an epic chocolate cake.. found it. I only went because the chocolate looked like this picture but can I say Go this is one of the top desserts in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Had the tuna on a chopped salad.  Salad was crisp and fresh, but tuna had no taste.  Service was top notch.  Husband's shrimp on chopped salad was excellent.  Think I just got them on an off night.  They have a loyal and devoted following.  House was full during our visit."}
{"text":"Used to come here 2-3 times a month. Came tonight and the Menu was higher priced, the portions were smaller, and the food was all way over cooked"}
{"text":"Bland!! I had the shrimp and grits from the brunch menu.  It tastes like hey just hit up a few ingredients, put frozen shrimp, and sautéed onions and put the hardest grits ever on top.   I started with the Quattro Famaggio, and it was similar to the shrimp and grits, no real seasonings.  I'm not a grey cook at all but I felt that I could have made both dishes better at home."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed to be writing an unhappy review about Red Rocks.  I ordered my steak medium to medium well it was raw. My sister ordered prime rib rare, it was well done.  They took my steak back to cook it some more and way overcooked it, way past well done, ruined. The mashed potatoes were plain and dry, the blue cheese was soaked in blood on my plate, the asparagus was plain and very woody.  Even the horseradish sauce had a funky aftertaste and no bite so plain! From our experience today the quality of Red Rocks is way down and will be a long time making the list of all the fine restaurants in Charlotte to dine! So to be fair..... Another in our party had a pasta dish that was really good. Then yet another really loved his salmon.  I'm not sure what one had but he ate every bite."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Red Rock Cafe and my husband hadn't been there in many years. We ended up here for dinner after going to Brixx Pizza and it was packed! (Hubby did not want to wait!)  Although the restaurant was crowded, we were seated immediately. The menu is large and varied, therefore a little overwhelming. My husband couldn't find anything that jumped out at him as he then realized pizza was on his brain. But here we are . . .  He chose the Reuben & fries and I got the seafood special - grilled mahi with creole corn-tomato sauce, fried okra, over wild rice risotto (I guess since it was Fat Tuesday they wanted to offer a Cajun dish). His was ok he said, nothing special. Mine was good but after further inspection realized it basically was all frozen or canned. Frozen fried okra (which I still liked!) and canned corn and tomatoes. The risotto was unique and somewhat tasty, but didn't seem to go with the rest of the meal too many flavors competing with each other!  I have no desire to return. It wasn't bad but certainly didn't impress us! I gave them 3 stars although 2.5 might be more accurate."}
{"text":"This was the pre-fixe menu for Mother's Day, but they only had one true breakfast/brunch option (Benedict) and though it was good, it certainly wasn't the experience that beckons for repeat biz. We'd go back, but probably wouldn't seek it out-"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, especially the chocolate cake, which is to die for!! Had our annual office party there.  Service was outstanding!  Food was outstanding!!  Only negative is the venue, the chairs that are on the enclosed patio area are metal and hard!!  Very uncomfortable!  BUT the food, service, music, waiter's attitude and demeanor were absolutely the best!!! We had a great time and just loved the attention we got.  Much better than other venues we have used.  Just wish they had softer chairs on the patio."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, the service is always on point, and the staff are accommodating to just about any request. The food can be hit or miss sometimes when it comes to consistency, but I'd definitely still recommend."}
{"text":"Red Rocks is one of those places you always feel comfortable patronizing; it just fits about every occasion.  We just popped in for a drink or two this last visit and were welcomed warmly and treated wonderfully.  In the past we have enjoyed a nice dinner here and would certainly do so again in the future!"}
{"text":"We accidentally placed an order to the Charlotte location and are very thankful for the hostess Anna who helped us in canceling the order because it was too far of a drive. Such amazing customer service! We will be a customer of theirs in the future! Thanks again!!"}
{"text":"Our first time dining here was a great experience.  The menu had a wonderful selection, plenty to choose from and all at reasonable prices.  The food was done perfectly and extremely tasty.  I had the meatloaf, and this is not your normal meatloaf- full of flavors and the marinara sauce was perfect.  I can't wait to go back and try some of the Italian entrees.  We saved some room for dessert and were happy we did.  What turned a very good dining experience into an excellent one, was our server Jenny.  She was very friendly and made us feel at home right away.  Personable, prompt, funny and honest."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Red Rocks on several occasions.  We have always had great food and a good dining experience.  Even our kids (ages 9 & 13) like Red Rocks.   Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Great experience having dinner at the bar. Excellent Blackened Ahi, Chopped side salad & Dirty Martini. Bartenders were superb. Friendly clientele. Great for business travelers."}
{"text":"This is the nicest \"café\" I've been to.  Very good quality and service at busy dinner time!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  I think the food is very good, although certain dishes can be a bit pricey.  When you go, you have to get the buffalo calamari.  Its my favorite thing on their menu.  During my latest visit, I had the filet and crab cake, which was delicious.  The food came out very quickly and the service was friendly.  I would highly recommend Red Rocks if you are looking for a nice restaurant to eat at in the Birkdale Village area."}
{"text":"Went for a girls night out. Birkdale had live music which made the outside patio atmosphere super relaxing!  It was extremely busy, but the service was still good. Our waiter understood we were there for just apps and drinks and came back multiple times for our drink orders.  It is expensive, but going for apps and drinks was a good value! I would come back for this!  We had the calamari, which was perfect! The pieces were thick and flavorful! We also had the artichoke crab dip that was served with tortillas and was delicious!  This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was OK. .. Glad I came during restaurant week and didn't pay step cost for mediocre food. ."}
{"text":"Excellent food, terrific service, and a great atmosphere. I recommend the peppered tuna as an appetizer and I've always enjoyed their fish specials. Their wine list is a bit thin, but serviceable. I rarely have dessert, but I tried their creme brûlée at my last visit and loved it. A crunchy warm topping with a fluffy cream interior: just perfect."}
{"text":"Busy spot on a Sunday so it was good to have reservations. Service was perfect -- so friendly and accommodating. Enjoyed a cup of the chicken and rice soup before a wonderful plate of the lobster ravioli with shrimp and scallops and baby asparagus. Brunch options were delicious too, others having steak and eggs, and strawberry crepes, crab cakes benedict. Jambalaya had the right spice as well. And portions were just right--not too big. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I got the Ruben without thousand island but with hot mustard on the side and a Cesar salad. Good food and service."}
{"text":"Ate here with some coworkers during a business trip out in NC.  The shopping area is very high class and so is this restaurant but with reasonable lunch prices.  I had the shrimp and scallop pasta for lunch (recommended by the nice waitress) and it was delicious.  The seafood was cooked just right and not overcooked as most places do.  My coworker had the salmon and he enjoyed it quite a bit.  I love how they have meals named after famous NASCAR racers, which is appropriate as Charlotte Raceway isn't too far.  Highly recommended, next time I will have to try out their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Very good service. We were seated promptly. Our order was taken quickly. As soon as our plates were empty our waitress was there clearing the table. You cannot ask for better service.  The food was okay. I had the Carolina burger that was a little bland. My wife had a Caesar salad with chicken and it was good. We had the raspberry cheesecake for dessert it was very good."}
{"text":"Went to Red Ricks for Valentines Day dinner and really enjoyed it.  I had the Crab Cakes and my Wife had the Mahi.  We havent been there in a long time but it didnt disappoint.  Overall the two entrees were very good.  The Crab Cakes were not \"overbreaded\" as many places do.  The Mahi was also cooked very well.  Even though it was Valentines day, the service was really good considering Red Rocks was packed."}
{"text":"I went here for a company dinner and had a terrific time.  We had a limited menu, but by no means was the food or the service compromised.  My steak was cooked perfectly and the strawberry shortcake was to die for.  I would definitely like to return to sample the complete menu."}
{"text":"I came with a few coworkers for a work lunch, and ordered the jambalaya. It was flavorful, but didn't quite have the punch of a true Cajun dish. I was disappointed that they don't have a lunch menu - unless you want to pay $20-$40 for lunch, at least 1/3 of the menu was off limits.   BUT, to offset my disappointment, I had the key lime pie and it was wow in my mouth. I could taste the freshly zested lime. It was basically perfection in a slice."}
{"text":"I joined a group of nine people and was amazed at how efficient the service was.  I was the last person to arrive and the table was full; there were no seats left. The server immediately slid another table up and made room for me.   He took our orders and the food was out for everyone within about ten minutes.   After we ate, individual bills came out immediately. It was almost the fastest service I've seen.  My salmon salad was good. It wasn't outstanding, but it was good. The noise level inside the restaurant was a bit much, but not impassive to chat.  Even though I try hard to not eat desserts, I know that they offer a wide selection of yummy desserts.  They also have areas that they can block off for larger groups, so the restaurant is really good for groups of people.  Getting into and out of the parking lot at the Strawberry Hills Shopping Center is not the easiest thing with all of the construction going on.  Even before the construction, I never really liked the parking lot. But with that said,  Red Rocks is a solid choice for restaurants in the general South Park area.  I have been going there for years and will continue."}
{"text":"This was one of my better meals on a recent trip to the Charlotte Area. If you are trying to decide between the Fox and Hounds and this place I'd choose this place.  Everything was great.  Thanks."}
{"text":"This was the ultimate so-so meal. There were four of us in our party. We arrived at 11 am on a Saturday to celebrate a birthday with (what we thought would be) a tasty lunch.   The highs were very high. The she crab soup is as tasty as I've had. Just the right amount of sherry to cream ratio- not easy to achieve. One person in my party also commented that the chicken salad was very good.  The lows were so low. I had the BBQ chicken medallions. Yuck! Rubbery chicken slathered in what tasted like bottled sauce. I also had smashed potatoes and broccoli- both very poorly executed. Two in my party had the Mac n Cheese as a side and neither liked it. \"Bland\" \"Looks like they ran out of cheese\". Yet another ordered a medium-well burger and I'm pretty sure when she cut into it I heard the cow scream \"Ouch\". Medium at best. It has been my experience that if they can't cook a burger right other menu items will be sub-par as well.  While the soup was very good, it could not rescue this meal from several culinary boo-boos.   Red Rocks Cafe- Birkdale Village: C-"}
{"text":"I've had several business lunches here. As a matter of fact I typically order the \"business lunch\". Not bad at all the service is good and the restaurant has a great atmosphere for a meeting. Little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Why don't you include your prices on the internet?  We are on budgets due to the economy and would like to see what we can afford.  Thanks BTC"}
{"text":"I went for a private event in one of the back rooms, but was extremely pleased with the service and food selections. It was family friendly, but seemed like a good spot for a date as well.  I definitely will return when I'm in that area!  Loved the chicken artichoke dip- yummmm!!!"}
{"text":"Just ordered the Lobster Linguini dish tonight as my first order.  I was greeted by two host and the door was held open for me.  There wasn't a wait the bar for takeout orders on a Sunday night.  A friendly African-American staff member working at the dessert bar was real helpful in telling me good dishes to choose from and dessert with pricing.  The desserts were thick and priced at about $8.  My order didn't take long at all. The atmosphere was 70s tunes and red dim lights in random spots. I asked for garlic bread with my meal and the bartender said it wasn't a problem.  Unfortunately, I found my Lobster Linguini to be quite bland. I was expecting some seasonings that complimented the lobster instead of relying on the taste of Alfredo sauce.  I do have about 3-4 servings for the money.  I'd like to visit again and try dessert but I see at lot of reviews of blandness of the dishes."}
{"text":"Had drinks outside with Matt and Helms after Seder Meal at church. Highly recommend sitting out there especially if Veronica is the server. She was attentive, fun, and just a consummate professional. Didn't have any food but didn't need any.  Friends and the service made the evening"}
{"text":"A favorite of mine for over a decade! I'm a regular customer at Red Rocks Birkdale for business luncheons or personal dinners with friends and family at least three times a week! Every bite and beverage on the menu is superb! Premium service and a classy hot spot where \"everybody knows your name\"! From the complimentary valet, top-notch variety of menu options, signature wine and cocktail offerings and the best dessert selection in the city - Red Rocks has it ALL!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was visiting family from Chicago. My friend and I decided to go out and grab a bite to eat. The place is in a nice area and the menu has several items. However the food that my friend and I ordered weren't that great. It tasted generic noting special. The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable. I just think overall the experience was average as well as the food."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and have never been disappointed. The service had always been excellent. Food is consistently good (plenty of gluten free options). Love the atmosphere on the patio. Overall, a nice place to take a break and grab something to eat and/or a glass of wine in Birkdale Village."}
{"text":"We were greatly impressed with their Easter brunch. Nice selection of food - salmon, pasta, roast beef, tons of sides and huge desserts. Staff was attentive and everything flowed smoothly. It seemed like an acceptable place to take children if you are tired of typical kid-friendly chain places and want good food. I look forward to going back for a lunch or dinner on a regular day."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Red Rocks for a long time. The service is always good and the food is consistent and good. My biggest complaint is that the red wine is always served too warm and I finally figured out why. They keep their bottles on top of the bar refrigerators. The heat from refrigerators warms the red wine enough that I usually have to put in an ice cube (not what I want to be doing.)   They now have a big beautiful outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Went on a first date at this spot, it's in the trendy birkdale area and has a patio with outdoor seating along the walking path. You can sit have a drink, people watch and enjoy life. It was Sunday so I had brunch, and wine. The service was excellent and the food was good. Oh, and we are still dating. Happy gal!"}
{"text":"We've actually eaten here twice this weekend...once when it was very busy (Saturday) and again when it was not (Sunday). The service and food was exceptional on both occasions. Kylie and Jordan were friendly and knowledgable. The GM, Chris, talked with us on Sunday which was very nice as well. We will definitely make this a regular spot to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Updating my review from almost 5 years ago. Since my first review of Red Rocks I have eaten there countless of times and I have grown to love this place. I love the lobster tail dinner. My kids love the penne pasta with marinara sauce. I adore the tuna and avocado appetizer. It's diced ahi tuna and avocado, tossed in a sauce layers with seaweed salad. Oh and it's topped with crispy wonton chips. I'm drooling thinking about it! Desserts are mouth watering. The service is always amazing. One of my favorite places to eat in Huntersville."}
{"text":"You know what they say in journalism, edit, edit, edit??? This place needs to edit. While I appreciate a wide variety to suit my every whim, this menu is just soooo big. It actually is kinda a damper when you are trying to enjoy lunch w/friends b/c it takes a while to read everything and you can't hold a conversation while perusing b/c the server keeps checking in. Yaaay attentive server, but booo for the reading assignment.   That said, the service for our Sunday afternoon baby luncheon (ie: not a full blown shower) was very good. The prices were excellent for the quality. The appetizer of chips w/blue cheese wasn't really anything to write home about-  the chips were too heavy and the garnish too skimpy. The salads were all very good, as was the pasta. The staff was very accomodating, placing us in the semi-private party room even though we didn't reserve it and they encouraged us to take our sweet, precious, child-free time and laugh as loud (nearly too loud) as we liked....come to think of it, maybe they knew what they were in for and THAT'S why they gave us the party room. Lol!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink last Saturday night.  It did not live up to all of the hype.  Too many inattentive servers standing around & socializing.  Restrooms were filthy!  Martinis were so-so for $10 a pop.  I won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is definitely a top of the line restaurant, and the prices reflect that. I've eaten there a few times the last time I had salmon it was really good."}
{"text":"We thought it would be a good idea to take my mother to a new restaurant to eat for Mother's Day.  We were wrong.  There was no direction that there was only a buffet until 3.  When I arrived, my parents were already seated and the sever was nowhere to be found.  When he finally emerged, I simply asked what was going on with the buffet and he explained that there was only the option of buffet until 3.  I frowned and was obviously disappointed that there was not any notice of that upon being seated.  The buffet had one awesome option of salad.  The other options were random sides.  There was an option of salmon that was horrible.  By the time we got to dessert, there was not anything left.  We were still charged the full price of the buffet even though we were noticably disappointed.  The service was abysmal.  Since we were serving ourselves, I do not know what could have been consuming his time but it was definitely not refilling our beverages.  I knew before going to Red Rocks what lied ahead.  I knew that the restaurant is an over rated local hot spot.  I just thought I would give if another try.  I won't make that mistake again."}
{"text":"Seated immediately. Service excellent. Food excellent. Had the lobster ravioli. Barely finished my salad when the entrees arrived. No waiting for anything. Drinks were even refilled before empty. Server checked in regularly. 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been to Red Rocks at least 5 times over the past 6 months. I've been satisfied each time. Great food, excellent service, reasonable prices. The reason for only 4 stars is the last time hubby and I went for dinner they tried to seat us in a side room where there were TWO separate tables both apparently celebrating birthdays or some other event. I knew it would get loud and I requested to be seated elsewhere. Then, they took us to a booth on the other side where I noticed there were several empty booths. Why in the world would you try to seat a couple near 2 loud parties when you have several empty tables elsewhere? Other than that, RR rocks!"}
{"text":"Let's start by saying the service was incredible. The hostesses and services were attentive, accommodating, and professional. The only reason for four instead of five stars is because the food was good, but not great. It's like I want their menu to be AMAZING, but it's comparable to Olive Garden; except more expensive. Try it and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Came here once for dinner. One of my former coworkers was getting married, and it was the bride-to-be choice. I had the Papa Love's Spinach & Walnut Ravioli with Chicken and we shared the Calhoun's Queso-Spinach dip. Everything my coworkers and I ordered were just ok, there are way better places to eat in Charlotte- in my humble opinion.    Three Yelps."}
{"text":"If you stand in the middle of the road by Red Rocks and see Fox and Hound across on the other side...just turn and walk in to Red Rocks....it's worth your time....the Fox and Hound isn't.  My only experience here is in the bar, but folks greet you coming in..the bartenders are very attentive and ready to serve and nice too.  My GF and I were calling it a night and had drinks and chocolate cake...which was H U G E!!!!!!  We had to take half of it home.  All and all it is a sexy place...good for a date...laid back and nice decor, so if you have to decide on a bar this should be the one in Birkdale."}
{"text":"A great place to dine for any occasion.  Casual dress is fine but you also will not be out of place if you want to dress up a little.  Prices are moderate and food is great. Although you may want to ask for dressing on the side if you get a salad (they are dressing happy) The deserts are so yummy...we try so hard to not get dessert every time we go but they are just irresistible! So if you are dieting, beware!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Cajun salmon at the bar and it may have been close to the best I've ever had. The bar staff was fantastic and actually treated me like they appreciated me being there. I only eat out once or twice a week so it was worth the extra $. I got there about 6:30pm on a weekday and the bar wasn't too full. It was starting to fill up so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Not as good as I heard, I went there for Easter lunch, they had a prefixed menu (appetizer, entree, dessert, 33 dollars plus tax) weird thing they dint have any entree with chicken. The only thing it was good was the coconut cake, because the salad and the crab cakes were not good at all, the salad dressing was to sour, the meat was cold, and the presentation of my food was ugly, we were a group so I was able to try the different options, but so far the Easter menu is NOT good at all."}
{"text":"Despite thinking this place is just OK, I keep coming back. Whyyyyy?!? I suppose it's easy. It's definitely close to work. They take reservations on Open Table. And, a handful of my friends really like it. So, here we are. Lunch at Red Rocks. Again.   My go-to order is the chicken salad and fruit plate. Their chicken salad is pretty tasty, all white meat. They bill the fruit as seasonal but it has always been the same mix of melon, pineapple, grapes and berries when I get it.   On my latest visit, I decided to branch out and try something new. I ordered the blackened chicken club croissant. I should have stuck with my usual. The croissant was soggy, I guess from the juicy chicken, and the bottom disintegrated in my hands at the first bite. In hopes of salvaging the dish, I peeled the croissant off and ate the chicken/cheese/lettuce/tomato/bacon with a knife and fork.   While I'll probably lobby to go some place else when the \"where should we go for lunch\" convo comes up at the office, odds are I'll loose that battle and be back again soon. I'm coming to terms with the fact that it's pretty unavoidable."}
{"text":"Let's just start by saying - This place ROCKS!  As I have done in the past I use Yelp, and the Open Table Reservations to make the weekends more enjoyable by placing reservations online more than a week in advance.   Our reservations were for 7:15pm and we were promptly seated at 7:15pm.  Our servers name was Ann Marie and she was fantastic.  She provided a few good suggestions for the meals and was very quick to keep our glasses full.  I had the Chicken Marsala w/ wild rice and vegetables (I have added a picture), and my wife had the Petite Filet.  Her meal was fantastic as I was able to swipe a piece or two of her steak.  It was perfectly cooked and was very tender.  Kudos to the chef. Mine was even better than the photo.  The chicken was tender, the marsala sauce was perfect, and had just the right blend of mushrooms to bring out the delightful flavors and it even smelled as wonderful.  This is definitely on the short list as it was very solid in its food,the staff, and the service.  Oh heck, I only gave it four stars, but believe me, it may be worthy of the 5th.  I will be back.......and I am hoping it will be as wonderful.  I would strongly recommend this place. If you have heard of this place and can't find it, it is because it is behind the Fresh Market off of Providence Road and has only one road into its location, it is not like you will just stumble upon it, you must search it out.  Remember to mention Yelp, and you get 10% off your bill.  NCFoodGuy"}
{"text":"It's been a while since we visited Red Rocks... it's tucked away behind The Fresh Market so it's easy to forget it's there. I've always opted for pasta here, while my husband gets salmon or mahi. Our last visit with great - we sat in the bar area and had terrific service by a super cute & friendly waitress (whose name escapes me right now or I'd give her a shout out). Check out their cocktail menu, extensive wine list... and be sure to indulge in one (or two!) of their amazing desserts. We are already planning a return visit this month... maybe they'll still be offering their Yelp check-in discount. :)"}
{"text":"Was in town on business and needed a good dinner. I popped into Red Rocks Cafe and was surprisingly happy with the menu choices and the bar.   The atmosphere was nice, more upscale than I had anticipated. I sat at the bar which was very clean and the bar tenders were super friendly. There are tvs in the bar area so if you're dining on your own and want to catch a game this is a great place.   My dinner was very filling! I started with a spinach salad and had Daniel Lyall's Mahi, which was very tasty and not overwhelming!"}
{"text":"Delicious chicken and biscuits. You can only get it for Sunday brunch. Good meal overall. Server was not thrilled to be working very obviously. Cute shopping area and if you can get a seat outdoors in the shade ask for extra ice ;)  kids meals looked quite good."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for 20 years!    Sweetie & I have been wanting to try and so we did!  The interior is intimate, dim with nice seating.  Mostly brick & wood type decor.  Very sedate.  We decided to eat at the bar so we could watch some baseball.  Our servers at the bar were very nice, but almost a little to enthusiastic (i.e.  listening to every word we said & chiming in).  But it's better than being ignored.  We both had the sea bass in two different preparations.  Livingston's Chilean Sea Bass over risotto w/asparagus & pineapple chutney, & Steve Urvan's Southern Citrus Sea Bass over Sweet Potato Fries topped w/Spinach & a Gran Marnier Buerre Blanc.  They were both cooked perfectly and were equally delicious.  I liked the Citrus one the best because the Sweet Potato Fries were lightly crispy & were cut short so everything fit on the fork & into your mouth in yummy bites.    The only issue with the dinners is mine came out piping hot on a \"please be careful it's hot\" plate, but sweetie's was only just warm - so it evidently sat for a while waiting for mine to be re-done?  Supposedly Red Rocks is known for their homemade desserts so we tried the something peanut butter bread pudding ---- it was not good.  Barely room temp, no flavor, hard, we both took one bite & sent it away.  They were nice & tried to interest us in another dessert, but we didn't feel like trying one after that.    We did let the manager know that it didn't ruin our experience with the rest of the food or the service & we would be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. Their sea bass and their grouper are as good as you will ever find anywhere. My husband's favorite is the grouper - I think they call it Plunkett's grouper with grand marnier sauce. He gets it with their risotto and it is fantastic. I'm a salad person and all of their salads are wonderful. We recently had a visitor from out of town and of course we took him to Red Rocks. It was the perfect venue. We ate out of doors on their new patio. It was the perfect place to take someone we hadn't seen in years. We especially like Dante the manager. He makes sure everything runs smoothly and always remembers us when we come in.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere. We shared the bruschetta as an appetizer and I had the blackened avocado tuna over a bed of risotto and asparagus. Everything was delicious! It was a little pricey but definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised to see such high ratings for this place. Does Huntersville really have that bad of food that THIS place is four stars? I do a fair amount of traveling and this place actually reminds me of an airport restaurant. The menu looks enticing but you end up with a bland and disappointing experience. The food was lacking in any flavor, appeared to have been sitting in a warmer for hours, and had the texture of being frozen or out of a box. I imagine that their kitchen is just a few microwaves, a warmer, and a lot of food package wrappers.   We actually sent back the crab and artichoke appetizer because it had that \"sitting out too long\" nasty crust on it, and the server even admitted it had been in the warmer for a while. I ordered a steak that honestly might as well have been steamed it was so bland. I'm not a salt person but I actually had to salt and pepper my steak. You'd think for a $28 steak they could go the extra mile and use a little seasoning. My wife ordered the grilled chicken sandwich that she couldn't finish because the chicken was so obviously frozen it was had that overtly grainy texture and rancid taste.   The service was prompt but very apathetic, as if the restaurant's location is what draws customers and service can be delivered at an efficient but bare minimum. I can't blame our server for the food, but he cared so little that he might as well have been selling magazines door to door.  I would return here only to sit outside to have a few beers (recommend the OMB) and people watch. Ordering food here is a huge waste of money though!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! I go every Wednesday with a group of classroom moms. It's always a relaxing lunch and the food is consistently delicious. Each week, we sit in the same server's section, Billy. We can always count on his stellar service, but all of the servers are very professional.  Do yourself a favor and start out with the queso-spinach dip or crab-artichoke dip (with or without bread bowl). The entree salads topped with salmon or chicken never disappoint. The crabcakes are to die for. And, don't forget to save room for coffee and dessert. The carrot cake is one of the best in town!"}
{"text":"Very Disappointed in this experience at red rocks on Friday night.   Our waiter Adam was excellent, however the music was way to loud, I asked twice for it to be turned down, I felt like constantly everyone including myself were trying to talk over the music, so we ended up having to move to the outside room.   The food came, the salmon was supposed to be plain with no seasoning/pepper as someone in my party has an allergy but came out and tasted like Cajun.   To be honest this is getting frustrating as food supposing to be plain has came out incorrectly 3 times within about 2 months.  I don't know why it can't just be plain? It is frustrating having to wait for something to be redone when it should have been right the first time.   I wish the music wasn't so loud and the salmon could have been right the first time, not sure if it was the kitchen or ?  Overall tonight's overall experience is a 2, lots of times it's been a 5/5. But tonight was a 2/5.   Update:  We went back to red rocks about 2 days ago and the manager took care of us.   The food was 5/5 and the experience was a 5/5. All the food was perfect with no pepper/seasoning and great!"}
{"text":"2 1/2. Went to Red Rocks Cafe on Christmas Eve.    I had the Chicken Saltimbocca as it was the servers recommendation. The dish was lackluster at best. The angel hair pasta was mushy and the sauce needed flavor. The veggies on the side were beautiful though.   The fruit and Chicken Salad plate was well received by the person I was dining with. The fruit was a nice assortment rather than simply melon.   Cost was very reasonable.   The service wasn't very friendly- I understand it's not fun working holidays but at least smile and wish your tables a Happy Holiday.   I'm not sure whether id go back again. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't wonderful."}
{"text":"You have to get the Thai Mussels.  High energy, swanky, modern and comfy restaurant.  I've been to just about all the restaurants in this Birkdale Mall area and I think this place is the winner.  The bar is fully loaded, lots of beer, and wine to choose from. The menu is interesting and will satisfy.  I had their Almond Grouper and it was done very well. The creamy almond sauce compliments the white fish very well.   I usually don;t go for desserts, but this place is famous for their cake. So I went with the Red Velvet and whoa.... it was worth every calorie.."}
{"text":"I had a party for a small staff here; our reservation was ready on time, our server was attentive, the food was wonderful and the atmosphere was fun.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Have to agree with many of the other reviews, the food is good but overpriced. Portions are small to the point that you have to order an appetizer or dessert to leave satisfied. The waitstaff is pretty pleasant, and I've never had to wait at this location. I have to say their desserts are very good though; the chocolate cake has 7 layers and is huge! With many better options in Birkdale I wouldn't go to Red Rocks often if it wasn't one of my girlfriends favorites. (Probably because she's a smaller eater and usually doesn't have to pay lol.)"}
{"text":"This is our second Thanksgiving eating at this awesome restaurant in south Charlotte. Food was delicious, buffet was bountiful with traditional fare and waiter Zee was friendly and accommodating. Think we've found our new go-to for Thanksgiving dining."}
{"text":"I've been to Red Rick cafe several times and each time the experience got worse. The last dinner my family and I had was horrible! First, my beer was warm then my soup was cold. My daughter filet was so tiny totally it was ridiculous. Then, last but not least my son had a pasta dish, and there was a HAIR in his food! 3 strikes your out Red Rock cafe in Birkdale Village. HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to start with how horrible this experience was. First the waitresses who work as a \"team\" were relentless in asking if we were ready to order, finally when we ordered we were first disappointed in the presentation after the food was delivered. There were no herbs to be found and the food looked plain (I had a ribeye and my wife had a filet). The food had no flavor, just plain. The \"team\" then started asking if we were ready for desert when half my steak was still on my plate and I was still eating it. Finally when we finished they brought out a dessert plate it was very unclean and waitress coughed over the cakes. The chocolate cake was the lone highlight of the meal. Will not go back"}
{"text":"RR would get 5 stars but they couldn't figure how to use a visa gift card even when we gave them the balance on the gift card.  Very frustrating."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot with awesome service and a huge menu! We started with the calamari and buffalo cauliflower and they were amazing! Lunch was the grilled seafood salad, which was okay, but the mahi-mahi wasn't my favorite. Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Red Rocks for 9 years.  It started a downward trend about 2 years ago.  I went on Saturday night and this will be the last time.  The food just isn't what it used to be albeit the menu is the same.  My daughter (23 yrs old) ordered spinach ravioli with chicken.  What she got was a soup with some ravioli in it.  It wasn't a sauce as you would expect, it looked like it was in chicken broth.  After she ate a few bites she said she didn't see any chicken, so we flagged the waiter since he hadn't come back to check on the food.  He apologized and went to the kitchen to get the chicken.  He comes out with a some chicken chunks on a small plate and said it was sitting there already prepared, they just forgot to put it in the ravioli.  Strike 1.  My wife ordered lobster ravioli.  It was bland tasting and anemic looking.  Strike 2.  We were there celebrating my daughters birthday.  When it came to desert, the waiter said went through the choices and also offered a complimentary pc for the birthday girl.  She said ok she'll have that and then he says they no longer have complimentary cake.  This was 1 minute after he said they did.  There were 4 of us at the table, we all heard it.  Strike 3.  Not surprising, there wasn't an adjustment on the bill for the late cold chicken either."}
{"text":"Jennie our server did an amazing job! She was very attentive and made the visit personal. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Made our second visit to Red Rocks last night and it won't be our last. From the moment we walked in the front door we were welcomed and treated as if we were important guests. Everyone and I mean everyone on the staff went out of their way to help us enjoy our evening. Even though the place was packed we never felt rushed and our needs were never ignored. My wife enjoyed Chicken Saltimbocca. It is a meal she orders often. I tried a taste and this was clearly a cut above the others. The flavors just really worked well together. I had medallions of beef with lobster mac and cheese. Yum, yum. The beef was cooked just right and the mac and cheese was a delicious compliment. Our friends enjoyed their meals as well and we all decided that Red Rocks will join our regular rotation of places to enjoy."}
{"text":"Red Rock has a great bar and restaurant atmosphere that is frequently full of regulars. I like how the restaurant and bar are very well separated...even the music is different. The food is good and the bartenders make great drinks (love the espresso martini and spiked strawberry lemonade). The bar also has liquors and wine you cannot find everywhere such as Camus and Don Julio 1942. What I enjoy is that the bartenders learn your name and do a good job of remembering you and your preferences. I frequently see the managers stop by to see how things are going. Really great service. I don't like that the poor servers have to wear all black (long sleeve button down black shirts, tie and pants) while serving in the brutal heat of the patio. Seems sooo hot. Regardless, love this place and highly recommend. Get the tuna...anyone will do (the have several dishes!)"}
{"text":"I had a pasta dish that was amazing. Hanna was our server, she was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The manager Kristen delivered us fresh baked chocolate chip cookies, which were amazing. The restaurant is decorated very tastefully. The menu has a large variety of foods. There were also many options for my vegetarian friend."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this place I say \"wow, what a great place and value for the money\" just wish it was closer to my south Charlotte home.  Menu is extensive and broad.  Service is always very good!"}
{"text":"Always feel welcome every time we had dinner here . We usually sit at the bar area because  we like to chat with the bartenders , also never disappointed with the food here ."}
{"text":"Not sure why is has taken so long for me to review this place. I eat here at least twice a month when in Charlotte for business.  Enjoyed lunch at Red Rocks yesterday and this place is consistently good.  Service was good and the staff can move your meal at whatever your pace needs to be for that visit.  A must of any visit is the she crab soup.  Some of the best I have ever had and served with sherry on top.  The menu has a lot of depth and selection.  I enjoyed the buffalo chicken sandwich with house made chips.  My wife enjoyed the perfectly cooked salmon over a salad.  This is a very good place to visit when in Charlotte, NC."}
{"text":"I was visiting Charlotte for business purposes and was happy to be able to have time to visit this restaurant - was referred.  So glad that I was able to make time to go. Everything was delicious and service was impeccable."}
{"text":"We have been going to Red Rocks for special celebrations for over 10 years. The last few times we have been there, it's been a big disappointment. Tonight we dropped over $200 for mediocre steaks and poor service on a birthday celebration for our daughter, and they were unwilling to comp her $7 dessert, which they have always done in the past. No desire to go back."}
{"text":"My cousin and I stopped here for lunch after walking around Birkdale. The salads were amazing! Not to mention their menu is great. There are lots of options available to choose from. I ordered the blackened seafood salad and my cousin ordered another salad with grilled shrimp. They were amazing and filling. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Time for a review update!!  3.5 stars.  I like this place, don't get me wrong...but the lunch I had the other day wasn't my favorite.  A few things on their menu are just missing something.  I had the spinach walnut ravioli and it was the lunch portion.  Tons of spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms..with hardly any ravioli.  That's ok, it's lunch, I get it.  The flavor was a little off. It was just too bland for me.  The sauce didn't have much flavor at all and the tomatoes weren't very good.  The she crab soup was yummy. The flavor was nice and I did enjoy it.  There were a few shells...but nothing crazy.  I wish I would've gotten the lobster ravioli.  Once I find something I like, I should probably just stick with it.  Lesson for next time.  I will be back.  I'd like to try some of their apps and maybe dessert.  The people are really nice and the service was perfect.  There was no wait at lunchtime, which is appreciated by many on their lunch hour."}
{"text":"We went to RRC for a rehearsal dinner last weekend. It was fantastic!!  All of the staff was wonderful!!  We started with the crab cakes, chicken skewers, and vegetables. The crab cakes were delish!  I had the filet and my husband had the seared ahi tuna. Both were spectacular!  You could cut my steak with a fork. It was absolutely perfect!  My husband loved his tuna. It was the perfect location for a rehearsal dinner! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant for a business lunch.  Atmosphere is very cozy with dim lights. Even with the restaurant being pretty busy, our conversation was very intimate. They have a TV that plays a fish tank scene which is awesome. Their She-Crab soup is amazing and a must have.  All the menu items are named after local celebrities like Dell Curry and Steve Udelson which is a fun touch for the few of us Charlotte natives.  Side note, this restaurant seems to be a big hit with the senior citizen crowd. There were at least 5 tables filled with charming elderly women enjoying a little lunch."}
{"text":"It took me a while to figure this place out. If you're traveling and here for a quick stop, listen carefully. Don't order the steak. Ironically, that's their weakest offering. However, you can order a wide variety of chicken dishes and you will be pleased. Ribs and burger pretty good as well, but chicken dishes are the way to go. Service is always good. Bread and salad are also good. Prices are a little high."}
{"text":"The food is extremely standard and nothing out of the world. It is pretty overpriced considering how bland the food is and how basic it is as well. The menu isn't all that great and it seems like it is lacking in full development when it comes to flavors. Every time we have ate there, we have gotten it to go. Maybe that is the issue? But I truly believe a restaurant that serves delicious food Will be delicious whether you take it to go or not. I ordered the lemon chicken and was very underwhelmed and disappointed both times I ordered it on different occasions. I don't think I would come back to this restaurant unless I really needed to. But considering the amount of restaurants around Birkdale I would rather go elsewhere. I also feel like the hostesses are pretty inadequate and are usually confused whenever we have let them know we were here to pick up an order or when we've asked for some sort of direction."}
{"text":"Great quality...great service. (sounds like a car commercial).   Yuppie preppie clean-cut golf-dude central.  Very polished, some dishes better than others, but most were pretty tasty.  No seriously, the food is good here, but I felt like I made it a little dirty just by stepping inside."}
{"text":"Awesome experience. I had the sesame tuna over risotto. Others had Cajun rib eye, spinach ravioli with chicken and walnuts, filet mignon, and salmon. Everyone was very pleased with their choices. The she crab soup was delicious also.  It was a little noisy, but considering it was Charlotte restaurant week, it was somewhat expected."}
{"text":"The environment here is great, staff very friendly and fun but unfortunately I cannot say the same about the food ...I got the almond crusted flounder and can probably say it was the worst seafood I have ever had prepared for me! It came with asparagus over rice which was mediocre given you can't really mess that up. My husband got the jambalaya which had a nice kick to it but once again just mediocre. I can say the dishes look nice when served, but they are not what I would expect for $30- $40 entrees. I did have a friend suggest the crab cakes if we ever go back so they must be one of the better dishes."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I ate brunch here today.  We chose this place today because my husband and I went there last year for his birthday and enjoyed the experience so much so that we decided to go back this year. Well, we were extremely disappointed to say the least. We ordered the crab cakes as an appetizer,  it was bland. But, we had still had hope. We ordered our entrees. My husband asked for scrambled eggs with feta cheese. When the food arrived, he realized there was no cheese added, let alone feta cheese. We told our waitress, she said \"oh that was supposed to have cheese?, Ok, I'll be right back\". I assumed she was getting him a new plate of scrambled eggs with the feta cheese. No, that is not what happened. She came back with a cup of feta and sat it on the table and walked off. We looked at each other in disbelief.  I lost my appetite. Then my daughter stopped eating because she simply didn't like her eggs. When the waitress came back to the table, I picked up the cup and and asked her, \"What is my husband supposed to do with this?\"  She looked like a deer caught in headlights. \"Well what do you mean\", she said. I said, \" Is he suppose to sprinkle it on top of his eggs?\" I'm  confused\".  She quickly stated, \" I'll get my manager\".  The manger came, but honestly,  it was a waste of time. He asked what happened, I told him, he asked my husband if he wanted a new plate of eggs scrambled, my husband said no, he apologized, left.  Service 101: it's always HOW you treat your customers that makes the difference. Another waitress who just happened to be clearing our plates apologized profusely, engaged with us and was extremely pleasant.  Had our waitress taken the time to engage and apologize (which she never did), offer another plate of eggs and/or comp the eggs, there would have been no need for a manager. I had never even asked for one.  Both the manager and waitress were HORRIBLE.  I'm extremely disappointed, as we were looking forward to a nice time.  S/N: On our way out, we saw the waiter we had the first time we went. He told us to ask for him next time. His name is Sam. He gave us some of the best service we had ever had, if we ever decide to go back."}
{"text":"Love it!! Atmosphere relaxing with dim lighting, dark wood tones with some bold colors on the walls.   We ordered the crab artichoke dip. It was served in a bread bowl with tortilla chips..was full of plenty of crab but not too much artichoke, but very good. Had a bowl of she crab soup and it was also full of crab and very rich, not really for me, but good. I had the wedge salad with filet medallions whic,h was very tasty!!! Would order this again. My husband had a cheesy pasta with chicken and tomatoes and some kind of bacon?? He thought it was very rich and creamy and would order again. Our 11 year old had the kids steak with mac, n cheese and enjoyed the meal.  We shared a lovely layerd chocolate cake which was very good. We were told that this cake was not made here, but it is still worth ordering.  We had an overall fantastic dining experience and will be back."}
{"text":"I have lived in the Lake Norman area for over 17 years.  I can't count how many times I've been to Red Rocks.  The staff and service is impeccable and the food is even better.  I have hosted several business lunches/dinners at Red Rocks, they gave us our own private room and made us a personalized menu with my customer's name on the menu.  Thank you Red Rocks!  Everyone was impressed! I also love going for a nice dinner with friends and family, it's my go-to place because I know that everyone in my party will find something on the menu that they will love because no matter what you order, it's cooked to perfection and delicious.  My personal favorites are the Thai Chili Mussels and the Tuna.  Their Tuna is the best I've ever had (btw, I travel every week).  Everything is so fresh, their seafood is to die for.  I also love their steaks, I recommend the filet medallions if they are on special.   If you want a great ambiance with excellent service, Red Rocks is the place you want to go."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in the Charlotte/Lake Norman area!!! It's THE restaurant/bar to go to if you like NASCAR and good food. I made the NASCAR reference because I don't think I've ever been and not seen a race car driver there. But more importantly their food is my jam. I always get their fried chicken salad with fries on it and felt the salad aspect of it counter-balanced the fried aspect of it haha They have the best chocolate cake in the world (why my friends and I would always congregate there for celebrations-one piece of chocolate cake bigger than our heads could feed us all). Plus the staff is great and the drinks are strong ;)"}
{"text":"Very good food except for the brunch buffet. The brunch buffet for Father's Day was not very good, with most of the food just cheap dried out breakfast items, yet it was very expensive. Not worth it at all. The normal food is great though!  Love the seared ahi tune entree. It is the best I've had anywhere. All of the regular menu items I've tried there have been great."}
{"text":"Made reservations  on a Sunday for lunch when children visiting from out of town. Wasn't that busy but they greeted us and gave us a nice table. Every one very happy with their food. I had black and blue wedge with tenderloin and must say it was best I have ever had.  Atmosphere is nice with outside seating available. The music was a bit loud but when asked to turn down they happily softened.  Our server, Shane was very good. He explained specials, very personable, checked on us several times and boxed up my leftovers.  Look forward to another visit!"}
{"text":"Red Rock's is always good, but I only give them 3 stars because I feel they're far overpriced when you consider the food options and compare to their neighbors (like Dressler's or the more casual Fox & The Hound). They have a hopping bar - though it's small. I will say they can make a mean cocktail. I do appreciate that they offer something for everyone: salad, steak, fish, chicken, etc. They also have a prime spot for outdoor seating and people watching!"}
{"text":"This was our first time back since the reopening.   Our waiter was decent. He said his last day is Sunday, which is a quick turnover. I got the chicken Marsala. The chicken had pregrilled marks on it and tasted like something from the premade freezer section. Not a $16 meal at all. My fiancé had the meatloaf. I tasted it and it was mushy and all I could taste was the breaded mix... did not taste like meat, which is unfortunate for a $17 meatloaf.  The calamari was... not what I was expecting. Thick strips of chewy breaded meat. No rings, no tentacles, no flavor. The only good things were the drinks and the veggies as they were steamed, good color, and not over cooked. I had been there once before a couple years ago and had a steak which was really good. I voiced this to the waiter, in good spirits because it was state night and my fiancé and I can always find a good time together. He offered to give us free desert, but I am not one who really likes desert after dinner. Nothing else was offered to make it right. I expected from a pricey establishment for the manager to come talk to us about our experience, but that never happened.  Our bill for 2 was $76, so it was disappointing. It's a big shame because we live in Birkdale so this is one of rev walking distance restaurants. I don't think we will be back anytime soon. There are other really excellent places in the area."}
{"text":"Food and service were good--had a reservation but got seated in the bar.  When we  arrived, wasn't very crowded, but filled up fast-quite the line waiting for a table when we left.  Looks like they also cater/host parties.  The menu, you have quite a lot of options, Seafood, Chicken, pasta...I went with Almond crusted Grouper with wild rice risotto and asparagus with a beurre blanc sauce and balsamic glaze.  The fish was cooked well, and the asparagus was perfect, not mushy-a good bite.  My dining companion had tenderloin Medallions with blue cheese crumbles--it came with fresh veggies and also the risotto.  Overall, OK.  Th Grouper was the winner tonight.  Will return to try other items."}
{"text":"this place is over the top.  the owner and the mgt!  five star service at very good prices.  excellent wine list.  by far the best locally owned restaurant in charlotte!"}
{"text":"Great food.  We came here on a Friday night for my wife's birthday and we had a wonderful time.  Red Rocks is great for Birthdays."}
{"text":"The bar server Emily was very helpful with the menu. She introduced us to the manager who talked about food quality and recipes he's playing with. He was engaging and terribly polite.   Both recommended the crab cakes and salmon dishes. Also the chopped salad.  Dan had the special (offered at New Years) pistachio crusted salmon with a lemon blueberry sauce served on caramelized sweet potato.   Do the Cajun salmon and don't share the risotto. So yummy!!  Each dish was very different but fabulous. The desserts look amazing. They are prepared by a local bakery. Excuse me as we dig into the 5 layer chocolate cake.  We'll be back in the few short days we have in town. I still have crab cakes to try and a she-crab soup.  Eat at the bar and ask for Emily!"}
{"text":"Stylish place with a very large and interesting menu. The good was very good. My dish was a calamari app which was different than most, strips with a nicely seasoned breading, fried greaselessly, and served with a very nice marinara.  Common bar fare very well executed.  My entree was copper river salmon, very nicely seasoned and cooked as requested to medium rare. A very generous fillet, clearly very fresh, and needing very little adornment. It was served with an interesting rice dish -  a sort of Mexican rice that was very sweet (almost dessert-like) yet also very spicy. Different, but it worked.  Wish they had a better beer selection as they just have crap on tap and the usual generic stuff in bottles. But all in all a very nice stop, and the menu is vast. Hopefully they do it all well. I will go back to try more."}
{"text":"For a place with valet parking, I was expecting something stellar.  Ambiance and clever menu names do not make a restaurant outstanding. We came here for my sister's birthday.  I ordered the chicken parmesan, my sister had the crab cakes, the kids had chicken fingers with tater tots and fruit, and my brother in law had a sandwich.  With my meal, I had a bowl of baked potato soup, and we split an order of bruchetta.  Tea and water all around for drinks. First, the soup was good.  It was recommended I add cheese.  It was basically pub quality, nothing amazing.  My chicken parm came out and I was surprised by the quantity of food... not in a good way.  It was a small chicken breast with their advertised home made sauce, and a small bowl of angel hair pasta. The sauce- nothing special... It could have been Prego with spices.  The portion was small for the price.   The crab cakes were ok.  They didnt hold together well and seemed small.   The kids food looked like it was off a Shomar's menu.  The chicken fingers were obviously frozen, and the tater tots were served to us still cold in the middle.  They were nothing more than the stuff you get in the freezer section.   Value?  Not worth it.  Prices are high for what you get.  We all left pretty unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Red Rocks Cafe is one of the best restaurants in Birkdale Village and one of my favorites in Charlotte.  You really can't go wrong with anything on this menu. The service is always outstanding, and their lunch menu is AWESOME. Highly suggest grabbing a meal here."}
{"text":"When my parents were in town, Red Rocks was the first restaurant I thought of to take them for a special yet relax dinner. This place can be a hit or a miss. on Friday night dinner time, we were seated very quick.  Love the atmosphere inside. Good for hanging out with friends and family. It is very cozy with dim lights.  First we started off with drinks. I had house margarita and Red Rocks Sunrise. I loved the sunrise (got sweet taste) but not their margarita. It was super salty, like I was having salt water. Appetizers we got was Buffalo Calamari and we loved them. She crab soup was good too.  My mom had lobsters combo and she LOVED them! My main dish was Blackened Cajun Salmon. It was also delicious. One thing though, my fiance had steak, he ended up didn't like it. He said it was bland. Well, I guess you come to RR for other dishes not steak. The desserts look amazing.   Our server was super friendly. Busy spot on weekends so it is good to have reservations. We will definitely be back again to try something else on their menus."}
{"text":"Wow. Our server, Terri, said steaks were their specialty. Apparently, they give you a steak knife for decoration because it certainly wasn't needed. The Cajun ribeye cut with a fork. There will be a return visit."}
{"text":"We moved here 2 years ago and were excited to try this place. Let me start off by saying it is a beautiful restaurant, but I didn't go to look at it. It was very disappointing. The food is just mediocre, nothing special or even good about it for the price. We even tried it again about 6 months ago to give it another shot... Still disappointed and we both agree we won't return. It just makes me wonder how places like this stay open. I would suggest the chef try something at Alton's or even Choplins in Cornelius, the food is so much better!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars.  My husband said it perfectly...it is like a glorified diner.  They sorta fall under the \"jack of all trades but master of none\" category.    We were here for Brunch last weekend and had a decent experience.  I wasn't wowed and I wasn't disgusted.  I think there are some things they do really, really well and then other things they could improve upon.  Their desserts for example are amazing (oreo cheesecake and key lime pie to name a couple).  But other items on the menu don't seem fresh or homemade...everyone loves their bacon salad dressing and their salads overall seem to be a hit.  I tried the steak and eggs meal and it was pretty good.  The steak was cooked well and it was rather juicy and tender...can't go wrong with that.  It was served with a hashbrown patty that was a nice addition to the meal.  Hubby tried the chicken pasta dish and it was decent.  The sauce was not bad but the chicken was pretty flavorless.  It was sorta like a rubber ducky heated up in the microwave and then slapped on the pasta.  It would have been better if it was marinated or cooked in lemon, oregano, garlic, basil, heck anything!    The service was decent...our waitress seemed a little disheveled but she was fine for the most part.  I used to work at Red Rocks in my waitressing days so I have a soft spot in my heart for them.  I only wish the best for them and I know they have a loyal following so they will do just fine!  I will be back and once you know what to order and what to avoid, you will have a good experience."}
{"text":"Red Rocks is always a hit for us. Seated quickly despite having a party of seven, Red Rocks did not disappoint. Our server was phenomenal. He was extremely attentive and responsive to our needs...it was almost as if he anticipated our needs.  I tried the cajun salmon for the first time. It was delicious. I was extremely surprised at the size of the filet; it was huge. I am not an asparagus fan so I substituted it for garlic mashed potatoes. I regretted that because I was in carb overload with those plus the risotto. But the salmon, risotto and few bites of the potatoes that I could stomach left no room for dessert. Not getting dessert at Red Rocks is an absolute sin. So I had to taste hubby's red velvet cake which was to die for. Our sons shared (it's massive) the five-layer chocolate cake. Always moist and decadent, the chocolate cake is a true choco-holic's dream. Our friends enjoyed their meals, too, and desserts ranging from ribeyes to lobster ravioli (delicious) and key lime pie and strawberry cheesecake. Once again, awesome experience!"}
{"text":"What an amazing menu - so much to chose from and everything I have had is very tasty.  Good service, and it is hard to chose between an appetizer or dessert.....hard to do both with so much food as apart of your dinner."}
{"text":"Three stars is based on the service, not the food.  Red Rocks used to be a staple among my friends and I. However, it has been years since I have been back since I have moved and it is not right down the street, as it was in the past.  My Mom and arrived shortly after 5:30, an early dinner before a show, and were seated and approached for our drink order. After reviewing the menu, my Mom ordered the Crab Cake dinner and I chose the Crab Stuffed Trout special.  The crab cake was breading only with a little shredded crab and definitely overcooked.  As for the crab stuffed trout, very misleading. It was a piece of trout with a crab cake on top. And, as I said, the crab cake was ver disappointing.  The trout was cooked very swell, but missed seasoning that I actually had to add salt as I was eating. Both dishes were served with fresh veggies, really??? All raw. And mashed potatoes or rice. I had the potatoes, okay, and Mom had the rice, undercooked.  Overall the food was a complete disappointment and I would not return. However, our server, and I hate that I don't remember his name, was so nice and was on top of refreshing our water, offering us another drink and checking in throughout the evening."}
{"text":"I know some people swear by this place, but since I don't live up that way, I never become a Red Rock groupie. However I thought it would be good for Father's Day, but unfortunately they decided to do a special (aka expensive) brunch that day. But on our way back home from Mooresville, my eternally hungry father (my only indication I was not adopted, or switched at birth) needed food so Birkdale Village we went. They didn't have a wait at 6pm amazingly. We sat out on the covered patio since weather was nice. At first it was going to be \"tea time\" for us, which is happy hour munchies in Hong Kong language. We ordered the fried calamari, and a bowl of she crab soup. The soup was good, I actually found real crab meat in there. And for only $1 more who would just order a cup? The calamari was tasteless, and it came in strips, which is an odd shape for us because we are used to seeing squid in whole.  We decided to go ahead with eating dinner. We ordered the Chicken Marsala ($15) which was ok taste but good portion for the money, crab cake sandwich ($11) which was another ok item but the potato cake was a little tough, and a small spinach salad ($6) which was yummiest of the 3 with bacon dressing with a hint of sweet.  Everything was ok, the service was a bit lacking but she was nice overall.  A solid 3 stars performance all around.   Food 3 Price 3 Service 3 Ambience 4"}
{"text":"Crab cakes ---Amazing.... Key lime cheesecake---to die for.... She Soup---Amazing.... I will definetly be back!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome here! I got a blackened chicken club croissant. It had a chicken breast blackened with bacon, honey Dijon sauce, provolone, and cheddar cheese. For my side item I chose the vegetable medley which was pretty good... I also got Tater tots. The chicken on the club was super tender. It was delicious. I will definitely be coming back. My server was awesome as well. She was very attentive."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a large group of people with different tastes since  their menu has a good selection of pastas, steaks, seafood and salads.  I thought the prices were fair based on the portion size however, the overall taste was average."}
{"text":"Honestly, I expected more. Based on the wait time and the prices on the menu, the entire experience was underwhelming. The food wasn't inedible, but I've had better meatloaf at a Bob Evans or Cracker Barrel for half the price.   With the number of high quality restaurants nearby in the Birkdale Village area, I doubt I'll ever be back here - and I certainly wouldn't wait to get in.  After eating here I'm flabbergasted that they had a 40 minute wait even at 6pm on a Saturday.  If you can get in quick here and nowhere else nearby, it's passable, but if you have other options I'd pass."}
{"text":"We chose to head over to Red Rocks for Charlotte Restaurant Week. While they didn't offer as many courses (just salad/soup, entree and dessert)  the entrees really stood out and slapped us in the face. Plus it's one of the last restaurants at Birkdale that we haven't been to yet. I'm pretty dang happy with our decision to go here because it ended up being a great meal.  We made reservations for 6pm on Saturday night. We were greeted quickly and shown to a table right away. I really liked the ambiance of Red Rocks...it's dark and quiet, and makes for quite the romantic/ intimate dining experience. All of the staff were friendly and courteous, and also knowledgeable on the menu details. We ordered some wine to go with our dinner and then prepared for the feast.  The salads were both very good. I was a plain Jane and stuck with the caesar salad, but it was so good. The dressing was one of those extremely light caesars where it's almost the consistency of a vinaigrette and not a clump of heavy, creamy goodness. I was quite pleased with it, and there was plenty of shredded parm on top. The miss' had the baby field green salad which had some crasiens, goat cheese and other goodies all topped with a fruity vinaigrette. Both were light salads that were a great way to start the meal.  I chose the Niman pork porterhouse as my entree. This thing was the real deal! It was a huge porterhouse pork chop, and it was COVERED with chunks of sauteed apple and bacon. The pork was cooked to a perfect medium and was so tender and juicy. The bacon that went with it actually gave the whole chop an overall hint of smoke that was awesome. And the bacon chunks were just that...CHUNKS! Not shriveled crunchy bits of bacon, but decent chunks of tender, fatty bacon. Those bacon bites, combined with the apple, really brought this dish home into flavor country. Then you have the sides. The sweet potatoes were hands down the best I've ever had. They were sooooo sweet and buttery, it was like biting into a marshmallow cloud. The whole dish was served on top of a bed of greens, which was initially a turnoff for me since I'm not a fan of sauteed greens. But those bitter greens really turned each porky bite into some kind of divine tastetacular experience. All in all, it was a huge portion of tasty food that is one of those meals I will remember for a long time.  The miss' had the blackened tuna, and that was also just to die for. The tuna was cooked to a perfect rare, and was so tender and had that wonderful warm outside with cool inside. It was served over a bed of risotto which was just insane. The risotto was so rich and wonderfully tasty, and blew away most other sides I've had before. It also came with some asparagus that was cooked perfectly and had a light buttery taste to it. The one thing she didn't like was the avocado. I didn't try it myself, but she felt that the avocado didn't play well with both the tuna and the risotto. The tuna and avocado were good together, as were the tuna and risotto, but when combining the tuna, avocado and risotto there was just too much going on.  After feasting on pork and tuna it was time to bring on the dessert. It sounded like each night would offer a different dessert option, and tonight we could choose from either a blackberry shortcake or bread pudding. We decided to get one of each and just share them equally, and there was more than enough dessert in the end for both of us. The bread pudding wasn't like bread pudding I'm used to. Rather than having chunks of bread that are baked it was like an actual pudding consistency, and was totally smooth all the way around and inside. It was strange for me at first, and I didn't like it as much right off the bat. However, once combining the bread pudding with the berry sauce and vanilla ice cream that garnish the plate, it was my dessert of choice. This thing was ridiculous, and if you go and see it on the menu, do yourself a favor and hit your server up with an order.  The blackberry shortcake was also quite the tasty treat. They used two biscuits that were light and dry rather than buttery and sweet, and this really helped balance the dish out. These biscuits were smothered with tons of locally grown blackberries that the restaurant gets from a farm stand right down the road. On top of the berries is what I think was a kind of creme fraiche since it wasn't sweet like whipped cream. The biscuit, berries and creme all brought an awesome dessert to the plate, but it wasn't enough to topple the mighty bread pudding.  Red Rocks is tentatively one of our favorite restaurants in the area. I think very highly of Alton's, and Red Rocks definitely competes with it as far as fanciness/ambiance goes. But the food at Red Rocks was slightly better, and definitely presented in a \"classier\" manner. I'll definitely want to return on a non-Restaurant Week day to sample the full menu before making a final judgement, but I guarantee we will be returning to Red Rocks soon."}
{"text":"Red Rocks has something for everyone. And generally under the name of someone you know. Seriously. I know quite a few people whose names are on the menu.  As for the food, it's fine. I've never been WOWed....except for the size of the desserts that are presented after the meal. Dang, that's some big cake. Plenty of vegetarian-friendly options, and for the carnivorous, there's the obscene Tom's Pittsburgh Salad, topped with London broil and fries.  It's a popular spot for folks a generation (or two) older than myself, and I can see why. Chili's wishes it were the staple that Red Rocks is for the Strawberry Hill area.  Service is fine, not overbearing...and they can tell that if you're coming in for lunch (or dinner, for that matter), you're not in a great hurry.   Oh, and right now, they have a Yelp check-in deal for 10% off your meal. That's definitely in their favor.  Red Rocks is often a choice for people working in my office or living in the vicinity, so I end up there more often than I'd rather. All in all, it doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Without a doubt my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. The staff is friendly and very helpful. A special thanks to Margo for helping me with arrangements for our engagement night."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I'm not one to order a steak in a restaurant. I'm just not that kind of girl. That being said it was one of the most flavorful steaks I've had out. I ordered the filet medallions and they were absolutely delicious.   I would say be prepared to spend 15 to 30 dollars per entree (Closer to 30 for most of the seafood options).   We went as a mid size group (6/7 people) on a Saturday night and had an hour wait, which is not uncommon for the Birkdale area. They had an option to text when our table was ready so that hour went by really fast which was nice. Their menu was interesting, I'm not a big fan of naming dishes after people who I'm assuming live in Birkdale but the menu was very diverse and a lot of the items seemed appetizing. I finally decided on the filet medallions with a side of broccolini and mashed potatoes which was so good. It seemed to me like everyone from our group really enjoyed their food and had no complaints whatsoever. I would absolutely come back!"}
{"text":"Management is awful and the food was cold.   On Dec 27th, my husband and I took 4 of our friends from out of town to Red Rocks Café in Huntersville, NC.   The table they sat us at was not sturdy and they didn't have another table available to sit us at that would be comfortable for the 6 of us.   One of the managers (I believe Joe was his name) came over and wiggled the table and realized we were telling the truth.   When he suggested we move to a booth that would not be comfortable for us, we elected to stay at the wobbly table.   Approximately 5 min afterwards, I saw two tables become available that could be put together to accommodate us, I immediately got up from my seat and approached Joe at the front of the restaurant.   When I asked if the two tables that were now available could be put together so we could move there, he replied, \"So, now you want to move, you've changed your mind...we may already have people waiting for those tables.\"   I was surprised by his response...caught me off guard. Needless to say after I went back in forth with him to let him know I wasn't going to sit down until he looked into moving us, he reluctantly moved us.   Several items (bread, French Fries, steak) ordered by our guests came to the table cold/barely warm.   The server did a good job replacing these items with hot food, but a member of the management staff never came to our table to apologize or check if our experience had gotten better.   My husband called the owner/General Manager, Jack Love, the following Mon. Once my husband told him about our experience, he became defensive and told my husband he was attacking him.   There was still no apology for the experience we had...just an emotional owner/GM who only cared about his feelings being hurt and not the experience of his paying customers.  I have been buying Red Rocks Café gift cards for my husband for the past 2 years.   A few days after my husband spoke to the emotional owner/GM, we took the last gift card I purchased to the restaurant and requested the balance in cash. We will NEVER eat at ANY Red Rocks Café again knowing that the OWNER (and members of management) don't have the business etiquette to interact with customers in a professional/mature manner.  To top it off, as we experienced and others have written in their Yelp reviews - the food that should be served hot, comes to the table cold or barely warm!"}
{"text":"Went here with my company for dinner, yum!!  We ordered their bruchetta and black peppered tuna for appetizers - so delicious!! Then I had the steak with asparagus and scalloped cheesy potatoes (with blue cheese and bacon in between the layers of potatoes) - at first it didn't look as pretty as some of the other dishes people had ordered, but as soon as I had a bite I was overwhelmed with the wonderful taste!!  Best Tip about this place: They serve large portion sizes of the wine & they come in huge wine glasses!!"}
{"text":"I flew in from DC and arrived at this establishment early (when it opened) for a lunch business meeting. Upon asking the hostess if I could sit and work prior to the meeting she gave me the dark bar as an only option. I was about the only person in the place. When asked if I could have a table outside instead she advised me that \"they really didn't like that unless I were ordering\". After I offered to leave she gave me a table on the empty patio. Once there I felt pressured to order food so I ended up eating my meal prior to my colleagues arriving. My waitress was very nice and my salad fine. The menu seemed over-priced for the area. Once my colleagues arrived at noon there was still no one else but me on the patio. I really don't understand why the hostess made a fuss about it. I moved to where my colleagues had a table inside and met with them while they ate. It was noisy and felt awkward having already eaten. Based on my experience with the hostess and possibly the prices, I don't know if I would come back here."}
{"text":"Parmesan Potato Cakes are just enough to keep me coming back.  I have tried several dishes and all have been flawless and delicious.  Very good food and atmosphere at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Red Rocks is great!  Been here several times w/friends & they've never dissappointed.  Chicken Marsala is the best, and HUGE portion.  Service has always been great and atmosphere is always nice.  Lighting is rather dim, even at lunch, but that's ok with me.  Always have an excellent & extensive desert selection & again, the portions are huge (well, the cheesecake isn't as large as the cakes, but...).  Not a drinker, but did order a Godiva martini once & it was WAY too strong - but I can't really speak for any other drinks other than tea & coke! :)    Outdoor seating is awesome; a great people-watching spot in Birkdale when the weather's nice. Oh yah, and try the mashed potato balls (appitizer), they're yummy!."}
{"text":"The food that I've had here has been pretty good. Drink selection is pretty varied if select on the wine and beer selection. However the service is hit or miss. I've been there when the servers are very attentive and then again where we had to flag someone down just to order drinks. Other than that great handout place."}
{"text":"Their hours are not accurate!! Looked on yelp and it says they're open until 11 on Sundays but they're not. Hostess told us their hours online have been wrong for a long time and to check the door. Pretty annoying. Won't be coming back, even when they are \"open\""}
{"text":"I've been by this place a thousand times but didn't know it existed. Its tucked away where you can't see it from Providence Road. I needed to kill an hour and grab a quick bite to eat, and thus got on Yelp to find something in the area. I stopped in and sat at the bar, and got a Goose Island IPA (pretty tasty) and the crab cake appetizer (amazing). The bar tenders were friendly, and they have 2 TV's in the bar area. The restaurant looks very nice and a little more upscale than the typical casual dining fare. I look forward to revisiting for a sit down dinner. Also, a good place to spend an hour if you need to in the area."}
{"text":"We were doing the art show so we called in an order. I went in when she said it would be ready. Wasn't ready so I waited, she said it would be right out, I waited, she went to check on it, it wasn't ready. Three others picked up their order and I waited. Someone brought me an order, wrong one so, I waited. She checked and said it would be right out. Thirty minutes of waiting and our food was barely warm. Won't do that again."}
{"text":"Not happy, paid $8 for kids buttered noodles, like are you kidding me? They used so much butter to, the noodles were swimming. The serve brunch on Sunday, but the kids have no choice. One of my kids wanted french toast and the only option was an adult portion with an adult price tag. I asked if they would be able to do a half portion and they just flat out said no. I will not be returning and don't recommend this place. The food is grossly overpriced, especially the kids meals. Completely unsatisfied and very disappointed. :-("}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner.  Did not know it was restaurant week in Charlotte. The restaurant was very crowded. Had a drink at the bar waiting for a table , which we did have a reservation for.   The Bartender (women) was very cold and almost impatient.  Thankfully our waitress Carley was a delight and made us welcome.  I had my favorite black and seafood salad which was great. I husband and the salmon specialist was also amazing. And Red Rocks is a great place to be."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find! Free valet parking. Outside dining with an upscale awning. Wine list was superb. Had a variety from seafood to steak to pasta. We had the jalepeno califlour and it was not too spicy my kids loved it! I had the jerk salmon. It had a pineapple relish. I loved it. The Cajun pasta was a hit. Nice upscale establishment with great service. Hannah was our server and she was great! Lots of desserts but we were too full!"}
{"text":"I Absolutely   Red Rocks Cafe!! Everytime I'm here or grab To-Go I always start with the appetizer  CALHOUN'S QUESO-SPINACH DIP Served in a sourdough boule with chips. I promise you won't be disappointed. As for entrees I  the WEATHERLY'S CAJUN SALMON The salmon flakes right off and has a delicate flavor. I like to get extra cajun cream for my salmon. Another yummy entree SALAMONE'S SHRIMP CAJUN PASTA w/Vegetables. Just FYI you'll be leaving here with a full tummy :) And wanting to come back"}
{"text":"It's a little tricky locating this place if you've never been before but it's totally worth it! It's behind the Strawberry Hill apartments and you can also reach their parking lot from them in the event you accidentally turn into the apartments.   The decor of the place provides a steakhouse feel, but the service was more personal like a local mom and pop shop. The wine list was extensive and was reasonably priced by the glass, but be careful... those prices add up real fast!   Our food was well seasoned and spicy where indicated. The menu is larger than most places near the Southpark area so take your time. Not that you'll be rushed but this place has a lot to offer. I ordered so much food that I wasn't able to order a dessert but based on the Yelp photos... I will be making my way back here for a wine and dessert night!"}
{"text":"Middle of the road is the name of the game here at Red Rocks. Nothing exceptional and nothing horrible. Why 2 stars vs. 3?  Because of the prices they ask you to pay for middle of the road. It's right across the street but never on our list when we think, 'Where are we going to eat?\". There's a reason..."}
