{"text":"Such good, authentic, Xinjiang yang ro chuan here!"}
{"text":"best Lamb Skewers i ever had since came to canada. and the lamb soup was awesome, they have excellent hand made noodles too. 

just one negative - the place is so crowded on weekends!! DEFINITELY make a reservation if you're going on these days."}
{"text":"Disappointed at the bland lamb skewers which were supposed to be the best in this side of town - at 3 bucks a piece they were really lacking in flavor and substance.  The cold noodle with fried lamb pieces on top was decent and the portion was huge - we got the medium which could have fed 6 ppl.  Decor was really fancy to the point that it feels out of place given the service and the presentation of the food - but it reflects on the price as once we sat down we were told about the $35 minimum per table.  Service had to be prompted but friendly enough if you manage to get their attention - like having to ask for tea and having to ask for change.  Overhyped and overpriced - this is not a place you can really enjoy unless you have a bigger group to sample all the different dishes"}
{"text":"Avoid at all cost!!

Just came back from it with a group of 7 and I have to say it was the WORST DINING EXPERIENCE ever!

Food was terrible and all tasted the same.

The tables were placed so close together that you are literally touching the people sitting behind you. 

The menu was only in Chinese so you would assume they would speak Chinese but they refuse to answer to you in Chinese although they can understand you.

Terrible service and just lack general etiquette. We ordered 20 skewers, 15 spicy and 5 non-spicy. They brought them out together on the same plate with the spicy ones on top of the non-spicy. Also, they will not bring you drinks. You have to get up, fight through the crowded chairs and sea of people, to get your own.

Parking lot fits 4 cars and was a nightmare getting in and out. I ended up parking on the residential street around the block. 

I think I saw 4 or 5 workers in the restaurant, servers and cashiers, and I have not seen one smile from any of them through out dinner.

Entire restaurant is covered with smell of lamb and that stuff will linger on your clothes long after you leave the restaurant.

To top it all of, they only take cash but nowhere in their store do they tell people this until you go to pay with your credit card.

All in all, it was the worst dining experience of my entire life and would not wish this restaurant on my worst enemies."}
{"text":"Went here with a group 5 adults and 3 children. The girl was very nice to warn me about not to park in the wrong area. She was also very helpful when it came to deciding what to eat- even though menu is rather limited. Kebabs are awesome- not greasy, spices are just right. Unfortunately bread was not offered (perhaps they have stopped doing it). Also had their lamb and rice. Lamb was very tender, rice was nice as well..a little sweet as it had raisins in it. All in all great place, would definetly go back. The only thing I would recommend is that they have enough forks on hand. Service was friendly- they may look serious but don't let that deceive you! :-)"}
{"text":"Menu selection is very limited but serving portions are huge! Lamb kebab was ok but we basically got fat on a skewer, not that much meat! :( Restaurant does not serve free water, only hot tea. There's a drink fridge that is at the front of the room that you have to go up and get your own drinks from if you want water, juice, etc.

Atmosphere was alright, quite busy around 7PM on Friday. It is contrasted by the casual atmosphere. Staff was not very friendly, took us a while to get their attention and they tossed the order booklet at our table..."}
{"text":"food was okay...  but you wont enjoy it, because the people serving it is... naaah, with very bad manners, rude and impolite 

will never go again here... :-("}
{"text":"We took some people's advice and called before going in to make sure they had hand pulled noodles.. Well, it didn't go so well! I call around 1:30pm This guy picks up the phone and says:\"call me during business hours\". I said:\"Absolutely, what time do you open?\"he says 3pm, I ask myself out loud what time it is(looking for something around me indicating the time) the guy on the other end assumes I am asking him yells:\" go buy your own watch! Don't ask me!\" And hangs up the phone.
A year later we still decided to go in. Small parking space. Small restaurant, very simple and the server was quite a friendly guy. Bad russian pop music playing in the background what I thought was an interesting contrast. We ordered the kebabs which didn't disappoint. Not knowing the menu we just looked at the table next to us and saw they were eating something out of this huge bowl, we ordered the same. I still don't know what the dish was called but it was a mixture of noodles, chicken, potatoes, leeks and probably other things. It was good. Didn't blow my mind though...Not sure I will visit them again as its a bit out of my way."}
{"text":"After they expanded to this location, it must have been too expensive for them to afford because lamb skewers are now $3.50 each. The meats are much  smaller too. It's too bad they aren't the original hole in the wall."}
{"text":"This place is small and busy. You need to make reservations before you go there or you will have to wait aside for quite some time.

They only accept Cash, not credit card, no debit card, make sure you bring enough cash.

Lamb Laghman(30-40 dollars) comes in with huge amount. It's good for 2-6 people. 

Lamb Kabobs($1.99 each), Rice Pilaf, Lamb soup(around 5 dollars) all taste extremly good, you can tell they use the freshest meat and really pays attention to the quality of their food.

I think the prices are very reasonable. The food taste good but I hope they make them less oily in future.

I was there late for my reservation because of the traffic, the girl there may not be the most friendly person in the world, she said I have to wait aside like the others at the beginning, but if you are very nice to her, she will most definitely surprise you. We only waited for like 10 minutes, and maybe she was still not smiling, you can tell from her tone and action, that's her way of being friendly and saying hello back. :)"}
{"text":"The best lamb kebob I've ever tried. I also ordered the lamb soup noodle. So impressive dinner, I'll come back again soon"}
{"text":"I thought the food was amazing!! I have always loved lamb skewers from china, having lived there when I was young. and Silk Road is def authentic xinjiang food. the lamb noodle soap was also yum. my bf who's nv have xinjiang and he loved it too!!"}
{"text":"I used to love the place before it moved and I was disappointed by my last visit to the new place. First of all, the food came insanely fast, all 3 dishes within 5 min of ordering, which meant it weren't made fresh. Lamb skewers were still good, but not out of this world delicious as before. I walked to the fridge and grabbed a Pop and my husband asked the waiter for a glass of tap water. The water said sorry we don't serve any water, the only available ones are the bottle ones in the fridge. Really?!! Are you allowed to refuse to give free tap water to patrons? I never encountered that and thought that part was ridiculous."}
{"text":"We had the calamari and me and my friend thought it was hard and inedible.  We ended up throwing it out."}
{"text":"Fatty oily lamb. What's more, we feel very uncomfortable after eating these. Pricy of course .  Won't come back again!"}
{"text":"I love  love love this place,I have been to their Etobico location many years ago and always been a big fan.So surprise  the quality and the taste remain the same in this new location.best Kebab ever!!"}
{"text":"Usually when a place relocates its for the better, no? This place somehow contradicts the norm. The lamb skewers are full of fatty tissue and not too much meat and the flavour is not as good as before. To add insult to injury they have also raised the prices. 

I guess they want the customer to pay for their decision to move and moving costs. But at least keep the food quality the same or better then before. 

We also witness the lady owner yelling at a patron because he said there was too much fat on their order and she told them to get out. I felt this was kinda rude and really felt sorry for the elderly couple that was with that table. The lady \"owner\" didn't seem to care and just hurried them all out. So I recommend not complaining even if your food isn't what you expect. 

All in all we probably won't be coming back here just because of that incident and also because the quality has gone downhill altogether."}
{"text":"This place is too packed and not worth the wait for the tasteless food.
Place is way too small and they pressure you to leave immediately after you eat because of the line-up. 

Not a good way to enjoy food.

Note: Parking lot is horrible. Even with reservations plan to wait another 20-30 mins outside like a dog. 


This place is going on my blacklist"}
{"text":"Lamb love... ( and to think that I used to hate lamb as a kid!)
!! they are moving soon...
Posted a pic of the new location!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Lamb kebab I've ever had, fresh and juicy. The service gets much better after they move to the big place. I also love the rice pilaf (???). I usually just order the vegie one without the lamb because it is really a good deal, 4.99CAD only. And their dried grapes taste so good. 

It's better you come early as the restaurant is quickly packed but they open after 3pm and close on Sundays."}
{"text":"No. 1 XinJiang food so far in GTA area. Make sure you make a reservation before you go otherwise you may never find a seat. Yang Yao Zi is really worth a try."}
{"text":"Born and raised in Xinjiang, I don't have high expectations in Xinjiang food anywhere outside of Xinjiang. 
Other than the lam kebab, I don't recommend anything, but it's still worth 4 stars just for the authentic Uyghur owners. Will go there once a while if I have a good appetite for meat.
The place is very small. Better make reservation before you go."}
{"text":"1. The menu option is very limited, 10 dishes in total?

2. No window in the entire dining area.

3. The waiter basically gave us the menu and asked us to write down the orders for him. (Hello? Are you serious about asking customers to do the job for you? It was 4pm in the afternoon so it was not busy at all. )

4. The chicken they served is very old and dry, not fresh at all. Yuck!

5. We ordered 3 dishes plus 1 small cold plate, costed us $110.

Enough said?

Definitely will not return!"}
{"text":"Lamb Lovers need to come here!

Reading some of the other reviews made me think to warn you! This restaurant is family owned, very simple decor, so if you want the best picks on the menu- go with someone who isn't new to this type of food!

I easily spend $30 eating there by myself...not to say you need to spend $30, but I always want everything.

-Must get their Pilaf rice!!! Amazing with lamb fat, raisins, carrots. There is so much flavor
- their clear broth soup (I like it with liver and kidney, but clear is still good and you can order with lamb leg, but I don't)
-reason I don't order lamb with the above options are the SKEWERS! Spicey lamb skewers are a must!!! Also the kidneys are delish if you are more adventurist!
- lastly their hand cut noodles are super chewy- I usually go without if I am by myself

yes. I did order all the above except the noodles when I did take out. 

Tastes just like it does when I visited China!

p.s park across the street also check open hours I believe it opens at 3pm"}
{"text":"There aren't many choices for authentic Uyghur (Turkish Chinese people) food Toronto, and this is one of the few places in the GTA.   Sure there are quite a few in the North East Scarborough end operated by ethnic Han people, but it isn't the same.

I got the opportunity to introduce this is a large group of people recently, and most of them had never had it before.  Most of them enjoyed it, all except for anyone who doesn't like lamb.  We had a couple of them, and there weren't many choices outside of it.  We did order the beef dish, and weirdly it came out lamby.

Luckily those of us who love lamb consumed their dishes.

The star though really is the hand pulled noodles.  It's a completely different texture to any other kinds of noodles.  

Aside from Lamb, hope you like cumin.. cause the flavour profile is everywhere in the dishes.

If you've never experienced Uyghur cuisine, this is as good a place to start as any."}
{"text":"OK.. so I've final met the kabob nazi.  I surely thought I was going to get whacked over the head, or jabbed by a skewer from the owner that night.  It was one of the oddest things.  I've been on a quest for authentic Uyghur food since my return from my China trip.  Took a group of yelpers to Xin Jiang in the north east, but had heard about Silk Road before.  Did a google search and came up with an article about how the owners who are authentic Uyghurs, refuse to eat in Chinese restaurants because it's a disrespect for his culture and started the first Turkish-Chinese restaurant in Toronto.

I was extremely excited to get here.  It's a tiny restaurant in small strip of 2 stores in south Etobicoke just south of Sherway Gardens.  Parking is extremely tight, and it looks like Silk Road is battling their neighbours for parking spots as the owner stood out front watching every car come in.  I overheard him tell another customer not to park past the divisional line between his property and the mini-mart next door.

I was also a tad worried about his stance with the Chinese, but when I arrived, it was all mainland Chinese folks who were here.  I was given a menu in Chinese, and while waiting for a friend to arrive I decided to take a picture, only to have the returning owner from the parking lot freak out at me.  He screamed for me to delete it now. \"Delete NOW! Delete NOW!\" as if for every second it was on my phone he was losing his secret spices.  In fact he stood over my shoulder to watch me do it.

Now, normally, I wouldn't take this kind of crap, but decided to forego a scene as my friend was just coming in from the lot.  As she was sitting down the owner was back and asked if we were ordering yet.  My friend none the wiser returned a smile and said she was just sitting down and he stomped off.

Silk Road is a bit of the opposite of Xian Jiang.   Where XJ had a monster menu, Silk Rd. had a minuscule menu of Kabobs, Laghman (fresh hand pulled noodles), Polo (a rice Pilaf), and the Big Plate of Chicken.  Period.  

We got the Lamb Kabobs and split a skewer of Kidney bobs, Lamb Laghman and Chicken Polo.

The bobs were freaking fantastic and as good as any that I had in China.  The other two dishes were just okay.  I have yet to find the consistency of noodles that I discovered in Asia.  The polo was alright, and was much more like a homemade meal than something from a restaurant. 

I do know one thing though.... For $1.75 a skewer, I dropping by and facing the kebob nazi if I'm in the west end.  But fare thee be warned.  Achtung Baby!

Unfortunately it wasn't Even Better Than The Real Thing, and he did move in Mysterious Ways."}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be at the old location.

Old family also sold the business (most likely) as I don't see any of the old wait staff or family members any longer.

PROTIP: Order off the old menu, but old menu, I mean the dishes that existed at the old location. The newer dishes aren't that good.

There is no old menu, you'll just have to do some research as to what the old dishes were."}
{"text":"Best lamb kebabs in the GTA!

If you have a hunger for roasted lamb, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Horrible place. I got stomach ache and I was throwing up after eating here. Really bad place and the Chinese waitress is awful to her customers."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I love their lamb rice pilaf, but I prefer just the rice. So much seasoning. Their noodle in lamb soup is amazing as well. They have recently moved to a much bigger place, but the queue is just as long on Friday nights and weekends, so I recommend making reservations. Much more parking spaces now thankfully. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to any and every lamb lover!"}
{"text":"Met a professional chef that raved about lamb kebabs from this place.  We went last night to try it.  Place looked like a small banquet hall for wedding receptions.  The whole menu maybe had  15 items on the entire thing tops. The lamb kebabs were pretty good except if you don't like spicy food better ask them not to sprinkle all those chili flakes on top. The noodles we ordered were ok.  Considering where this restaurant was situated they were steady busy."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience I have ever had in Mississauga. 

Reason 1: the food was completely too salty, the noodles were under-cooked, the portions were so small for its price, and when we ordered a bowl of rice what they gave us was microwaved uncooked rice from the freezer, it was so bad that we had to cancel our order and ask them to take their rice back. 

Reason 2: their service was nonexistent, you order your food as you wait in line to be tabled by putting what you want on a sheet, and sit down and wait for your food. There is no water or anything provided as you have to purchase it from them. It was practically like being seated at a fast food restaurant, except they deliver the food to your table. 

Reason 3: Their food was so overpriced! three dishes and 4 lamb kebabs amounted up to over 100 dollars! At any other restaurant for that exact amount of food it would not even surpass 70 dollars. AND to add onto that, the food would atleast be half decent. 

Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant. I actually had such high hopes when I had first entered, only to have it all shattered."}
{"text":"These folks moved into a new location- it looks like a banquet hall complete with fine tables and chairs and chandeliers...too bad the service doesn't even come close to the classy surroundings. We were treated with such rudeness right from the start- served warmed up mains and told when served that we are only allowed to stay for an hour maximum! The place was 75% empty so we were really puzzled with that one....with service and attitude like that I doubt this place will stay around for long. All the great reviews are a mystery....the food was microwaved and the kebabs tasted like lighter fluid. What a shame."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????OK?????????????????????????????????

??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little place for lamb lovers. It is very popular among Chinese. Pros: good quantity, taste, traditional music, friendly service. Cons: pricy, too small, long line on weekends, closed Sunday. I recommend it."}
{"text":"The best lamb skewer I ever have!! Unlike other lamb in many restaurant, it has the most original lamb taste.Taste so good and the staffs are quite friendly."}
{"text":"Had the lamb noodle soup, lamb skewer and lamb organ(?) skewer. The soup tastes good but the meat is inadequate. Its mostly soup, really. Anyway, the skewers are pretty good, although I could not tell the difference between the lamb and lamb organ skewer- they tasted the same. The skewer meat is quite peppery and fatty. A little less pepper please. Ambiance is average. I think it's a lot more expensive than it should be- everything cost me about $25 with tax and I don't think the price justifies the experience."}
{"text":"I went there on a friend's recommendation

Tried
- Lamb Soup
- Lamb Skewers

 Very delicious and the best lamb skewers I ever had. I highly recommend here lamb soup.

Staff is very nice.

Will visit soon with more friends and introduce them to this food heaven. Ok"}
{"text":"I think they need to reevaluate the lamb skewers. Lots of cumin, lots of chewy cold (tastless?) fat. I think it would taste better piping hot and a bit leaner. Maybe came at a bad time though later at night.

Also had a taste of the lamb noodle (organ?) soup. It was pretty funky, not sure my canadian palette truly appreciated it so I won't ding them for something I don't understand."}
{"text":"I don't go to Mississauga very often however, whenever I am, I always make it out to Silk Road... even if I have dinner plans elsewhere. We typically pick up take-out for a late night snack or lunch the next day. I've been going to Silk Road for years and I've always ordered the same things. First of all, their lamb noodle soup is amazing, the broth is very flavourful with black pepper and goji berries coupled with their flat noodles; definitely my favourite dish here. I always get the lamb pillow as well without the lamb leg on top (I find the lamb leg a little dry and plain), I'd much rather get the lamb kabobs to accompany the rice. Lastly, along with the noodle soup and rice, I usually pick up a few lamb kabob skewers. I love how it's very fatty but also very well spiced. However, I noticed the price go up on these kabobs to 3.59, so at that price I'm not sure if I would continue to get them. When i first started coming here they were only 1.99. On another note, I take-out portions seem to be bigger than dining in.

All in all, a great hidden gem in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"I traveled in Xinjiang a few years ago and this restaurant really took me back. The food was spot on. We ordered lamb kebabs, dapanji (a huge plate of chicken, potatoes, peppers, and thick noodles in a savory sauce), and two plates of noodles - lamian (pulled noodles) with sauce, and chopped noodles. On top of that we ordered some lamb soup as well.

Everything was delicious - their standout dishes are definitely the lamb kebabs and the noodles. Uyghur noodles are delicious - they're hand-pulled and have a great chewy bounce to them. 

The service and decor are a bit minimal, but who cares? You come here for the food. If only they opened up downtown, I'd be eating here every week."}
{"text":"This is a popular place for Chinese, the lamp is really good. But since they move to Mississauga, the price went up and the food got less."}
{"text":"What happen to this new location?
Places got bigger but the waitress got angrier @.@...

This new location is around 3 times bigger than the old location. It looks like a banquet hall that people have wedding. They use white chair covers for the chairs and those covers looks kind of dirty with oil grease on them.

We were greeted in with an angry waitress. I thought maybe one of us have owed her money. We sat down and told her that there was still a person coming. We sat down for 45 min waiting for our friend to come with only 5-6 tables occupied. The waitress kept on asking us when we will be ready to order. We told her there was one more person coming and the restaurant wasn't even half full and she was already pushing us around, very bad service...

There was no water provided for the meal like the old location. You have to buy drinks from them instead. 

We ordered a big plate of chicken and lamb noodle soup. The noodles at the bottom of the chicken plate tasted excellent. For both of the meals, they were all super salty. I remembered back in the days, they weren't that salty. The soup tasted horrible because of the salt and after we had a piece of chicken we couldn't taste anything afterward because of the salt. However, we weren't the only table complain. The table behind us complained the same as well.

We also ordered the lamb skewers. They were a bit expensive because it was $3 a skew. 

As we were leaving, and walking to the hallway, we were greeted out with the same angry waitress again. Interestingly, how we got greet in and out with the angry look on her face.

EXPENSIVE FOOD WITH FAST FOOD SERVICE.........................

I probably won't go back again and won't recommend to my friends anymore."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. They don't serve water, half their menu was sold out and the owner was extremely rude. Food was only okay but will never go back due to my experience here."}
{"text":"Follow up to my review at Silk Road a month ago I went again with my kids 2 days ago since I loved the food so much. I originally gave it a 4 star but had to write a review of my most recent experience there. I made reservations thinking it would be packed. We got there and the place was close to being empty! There was only 2 other tables there besides us.  We got there told the server we made reservations. He took us to the table that was reserved. But then the lady in the front told him to come. I'm guessing that's his boss. He then came back to our table after we took off our jacket and poured tea into our cups and was settle in that his boss told him to move us. I asked why and he said it was because he gave us the wrong reserved table. He then ushered us to this table way in the front where the kitchen was. During this time the table we sat at originally was empty the entire time we were there even after close to two hours no one showed up. So I'm thinking you couldn't just leave us there and let us have our meal in peace instead of disrupting us and moving us?! I was quite annoyed at that point. We ordered 2 lamb noodle soup to be shared amongst me and 2 kids as well as 2 Lamb skewers.  When the soups came I asked for a third bowl that's the same size so I can split the soup into 3 bowls evenly for us to share and I've  been here many times and never had any hassle when I made the request. The server again went back to his boss to whisper something to her and came back saying his boss said no to the big bowl and he had to get me a tiny bowl. So I asked why. He said because they need it for other customers. I looked around at the nearly empty restaurant and ask who it's for?! The server then got embarrassed and finally gave in and brought me the bowl. The bowl was dripping wet with water so I know he probably took a dirty one that someone recently used and rinsed it quickly to give it to me. It had grease on it when he brought it to me. I was so disgusted!!!! I didn't use the bowl at all. Due to this horrible experience from the moment I stepped into the restaurant they have now lost a loyal customer. Even with the increased in price we still went.  We usually visit Silk Road once a week. Not anymore. The price went up and the quality of the service went down.  I can see why people stopped coming here.  I can't see this place lasting that long. So disappointing."}
{"text":"The banquet style setting really throws you off for what you're actually getting at the restaurant. Water (included tap water sadly) is nonexistent as you are required to purchase self-served drinks from their refrigerator. Expect your food to arrive to your table within 5 minutes as the food is microwaved and over salted. Food is extremely overpriced. For what you're paying for, you might as well spend your money elsewhere. I really don't understand why this restaurant is still in business."}
{"text":"I guess I picked the perfect day to come to Silk Road Restaurant...

Cold and Snowy...... as I drove in the empty snow covered parking lot with no idea how and where to park my car...

Should I be excited to have lamb everything? I am never a huge fan for lamb but I have to say Silk Road might have converted me. 

Lamb Noodle Soup ($9.99)
- Love this Clear Broth version! The aroma of lamb is subtle and memorable with a hint of herb and spice
- Homemade noodle chewy with good bite, without the floury taste as some of the other place I been to

Lamb Skewers ($1.99 each)
- love the spice on the lamb... the meat is chunky so the inside of the meat still really moist 

\"Ding Ding\" Fried Noodle ($8.59)
- remind me of those kraft dinner package pasta, but of course these have a lot more bite to it..since these are freshly made!
- The sauce is kind of sweet and salty and a little gooey for my taste

Service though a little indifference but I am here for the food... I got my water, food and bill.. and I am happy.

Silk Road Restaurant is definitely a great place for some Lamb Hand Made Noodle Soup..... I will be back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing! The food standard has dropped a lot. The fried noodle with lamp was not yummy any more. All dishes are very salty. The lamp kebab was delicous though."}
{"text":"Drive 1hour to this small place. Meat lovers' paradise :) Lamb rice and grilled lamb  stickers"}
{"text":"I am now conflicted about Silk Road restaurant.  After they moved from Etobicoke, the family charm has kind of disappeared, and prices have gone up/portions have reduced in size (in particular, soup noodles and the soup).  What gives??  However, the lamb skewers are still juicy and fatty as ever, the noodles are still springy and delicious, and you still leave the restaurant smelling of cumin.  They have also hired wait staff and have outfitted the place with a fancy new dessert case.  Drinks are still self serve.  The decor is a little strange - a bit of French renaissance (chandeliers??  sconces?)and Central Asian flair and seat covers, making it look like this is a place for a Chinese wedding.  

We went on a Tuesday night quite early on and it was fairly empty, but as the night wore on all the tables filled!  I'm glad they are still doing brisk business and will likely return, but disappointed compared to what it used to be.  Side note: Make reservations!  And note, it's cash only!   One other observation: there is lots of parking now!  No more getting into near-accidents!"}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've been to Silk Road, and I have to say, it has improved leaps and bounds.  Hand pulled noodles are actually available (love the soup noodles the best - less so the stir fried noodles) lamb kebabs are still AMAZING, and staff are much friendlier, if not harried.  There is a nice family feel to this place too.  The restaurant has also renovated its decor to be a bit more welcoming.  

Try to make a reservation or arrive earlier in the evening - this place is usually RAMMED with my Chinese brethren (a good sign that the food is good) and you'll have to wait for a seat!  You can order your food while you're waiting however, for it to arrive when you do get a seat.  Beware - the menu I believe only comes in Chinese, so it is good to go with someone who can read it (the wait staff all speak English though!)  

As well - because the place is small, you may be elbowing people when you do get a seat.  Expect your clothing to smell like cumin after your visit."}
