{"text":"I came to this place to eat tacos, and I was not impressed by the taste of the meat. I haven't tried anything else, but I don't think I'm coming back. I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"This is a real deal taco shop 4 salsas to start next the beans are perfect the portions are huge and the price is right. It's not glitter it's just good. I am from San Diego and this is as close as you're gonna get to real authentic Mexican food. Here's a thought every time I've been a majority of the customers are Hispanic so what's that tell you? If you're looking for a new taco spot (most people are) try this gem!"}
{"text":"Great Tacos! Clean kitchen! Friendly staff! Definitely coming back!  They have aguas frescas! And their tacos taste was delicious!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just decided to try Gerardo's and we were both AMAZED! She ordered asada tacos and I ordered a pollo asado burrito and we were not disappointed. The prices are great and the food is even better. We'll definitely be returning customers."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good and the ppl that work here is so nice every time I come with my daughter they make u feel so welcome and the food is amazing I use to drive 30 mins away to get tacos now I found a place that is not far at all thank u"}
{"text":"great tacos, free limes! carne asada all day"}
{"text":"Very good food , quick and authentic, Love the breakfast Burrito always mad perfect,  and service with a smile"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Love the pasole and carne asada plate. Great deal and I was so full at the end of my meal!"}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting this place and is worthy write a review. Last time I had the tacos and this time I had a burrito ~delicious and consistent on the flavor of the food~a nice simple menu of choices~the cook is the most down to earth person and come to find out he is also the owner \"Gerardo\"  I love it when I find a place that is not a chain of fast food, this place by far is now on my list of favorite Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Pretty similar to Roberto's except they have good street tacos. Their beans taste homemade and their salsa is made on-site. Food is not as greasy.  Overall we prefer this place since there is a touch of care put into the food they serve."}
{"text":"I loved the prices and flavors. The salsa bar is thuper good and I like the carrots. The gentleman behind the counter is very sweet and kind. No fountain drinks but they do have 12 different drink options (Mexican coke and such).   Loaded the quesadilla with chicken. Tacos are $2 and covered with meat. Great flavor. Better than Roberto's.   Totally made with love."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I had the carne Asada tacos with rice and beans and the burrito and enchilada plate.  Everything besides the beans was amazing!  The beans were just okay.  I also had a shrimp tostada and it was muy delicioso!  The flavor and tastes and price was better than expected and I would recommend to anyone.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good Taco shop. Great salsa, the Carne Asada Burrito is fantastic is great an the rolled tacos are very good. Excellent value and I cant wait to return for other items on their menu. The meat has flavor and is not greasy or dry."}
{"text":"This place is great,been stopping here for the past 6 months & If always had a good experience.The employees are always nice and welcoming,the food taste great and it's reasonably priced.One of the best Mexican food spot's on that side of town."}
{"text":"Some of the Best tacos I've eaten in the valley! The other yelpers brought me here and I'm so glad I tried them out. I will be back to order more. This place was packed during lunch hour. Check them out and you will definitely enjoy the home cooking!"}
{"text":"Wish I had taken a picture of my enormous burrito, but it quickly disappeared into my belly. Intent on testing the legitimacy of this new 5-star hotspot, my husband and I tried their rolled tacos and al pastor burrito. Great grub, great staff, don't pass this place up. (Poor Jefe's...) Me and my food baby are very pleased."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem in the Northwest! Tucked away in the northeast corner of Ann and 95Fwy. The cooks have excellent knife skills, the place is clean, and it's family run. I normally would only give something 5 stars if it was a transcendental experience but it's the day after St Pats and menudo is exactly what I want.  I had lunch here yesterday and it was exactly what I wanted.  So 5 stars it is! And they have the pink pickled onions!"}
{"text":"I was going to the taco place across the street but he said that he's sold out on my order!!! Anyways I went to this place instead and wow ... Tacos are amazing, salsa bar is very good place is clean. My new favorite taco stop for sure."}
{"text":"This is the best taco shop I have been to!   Get the rolled taco combo. I always fear rolled tacos because they are so oily and over cooked creating a real hardness to the shell. These are crisp and tender at the same time. The meat is tender. Their refried beans are a bit salty and the dissapointment of the combo.   I also tasted the cheese quesadilla. It was very large; the tortilla was the right thickness for an authentic tortilla. It came with very little guacamole and some thin sour cream. Both dishes came to $12.   If you want some good Mexican food give this place a try. It is absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"Just wasted $20. This place is trash. The beans taste weird and old. As did the enchiladas. And I asked for chicken for my meat. No idea what type of meat this is. Is this ground chicken? Ewww!!! They put too much old rice and beans in the burrito. I can't eat it. Then I got a Shrimp Tostada, soggy wet shell and the Shrimp was too sour/salty. This place and food do not live up the the reviews. Mediocre service. Food is horrible. These reviews can't be real. Smh never again!"}
{"text":"Great place great food love the different meat flavors on the tacos ,salsa stand w different good salsas , breakfast is also good and the great think no 50 cents on credit or debit transaction I really recommend the Denver omelette , love this little taco shop."}
{"text":"This place is legit, there tacos are delicious .... i had carnitas and asada tacos. A lot of flavor and plenty of meat... was over flowing ! There rice and beans tasted good as well. Nice salsa bar too.. Place was clean and staff were friendly.  Gonna get there asada chilaquiles next time . Thanks Gerardo's !"}
{"text":"As other reviewers have said, the beans are great. They are homemade tasting. We got two different combos, and they were just ok. One combo was for Chile Rellenos and they were soggy with oil. The chili's looked like Pasilla chili's and looked good but theThe sauce on top was only ok. The cheese enchiladas were only warm and the cheese was not melted."}
{"text":"I have my new favourite go to for Mexican food! We kept hearing about the location, including a menu in the mail, so we finally checked it out and was not disappointed.  Very friendly staff, who was very helpful with describing their menu. We ordered the hard tacos with chicken combo, a breakfast chorizo burrito and a shrimp burrito.  Large portions at an awesome price.. You won't leave hungry or not happy! I've never had hard tacos that match these in flavour, crunchy shell, traditional shredded chicken meat, and the rice and beans were perfect.  The shrimp burrito is overflowing with shrimp and flavour, and I couldn't get my partner to put down his chorizo burrito.  Step aside Roberto's and Jefes, there is a new contender in town."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. Tacos are well priced and the have Posole and Chile rellenos everyday! Food is great they'll even grill up a chile to go with your meal if you ask. Great find"}
{"text":"Very very good quality meat, the tacos were amazing. I got 5 Asada with a side of rice. The food was delicious. My boo got a Milanesa torta and he loved it as well. The service is great and fast. Very homey feel to this place."}
{"text":"Again I was initially trying to go to the place across the street which is Jefes, and again it was closed.   So I came across the street to Gerardo's and of course it was open. This time around I got the Asada burrito (take home). The burrito was very good and filled with meat, not rice and beans. In fact I didn't even know it had rice and beans until I was almost done because there was so little of it and a lot of meat. The burrito also includes onion, cilantro as well and a good amount of avocado, not just a guacamole mix. I will be coming again and trying something new. So far I have had no disappointments."}
{"text":"I ordered two breakfast burritos.  One came as ordered.  I informed the cashier in Spanish and English that my son was allergic to egg.  Despite that factoid, the second breakfast burrito was made with egg.  My other son ate it.  I ordered a third burrito for my son and specially said, potatoes, sausage, and cheese only.  The burrito came with potatoes and sausage only.  Still incorrect.  Will not come back as other reviews had stated the same thing about their orders being incorrect.  I ordered in Spanish and English."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is great! The carnitas are soooo good, and the chimichanga mm'mmm!  Friendly staff, and super quick service.  I'll surely be back."}
{"text":"Prices are so affordable for all the food items. Tacos have plenty of meat. The meat is seasoned just right. I love the taste of the chicken.   Burritos taste fresh. Really all their food taste fresh. The chilaquiles are a breakfast favorite with the eggs and steak.  Can we talk about the beans and rice? They taste so home made like grandma was back there making them with love and they're to perfection!   A must try hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Great food! I had the asada tacos and burrito and my hubby had the chorizo breakfast burrito. So flavorful! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a place that has ground beef tacos since I moved to Vegas. I love their ground beef tacos. I've also had the chicken. This is my place for ground beef tacos. Looking forward to trying other things on the menu if I can stop orders my favorite."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Far superior to Roberto's, with much better prices. The salsa bar was super clean and fresh. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good Roberto's style/California style Mexican food. They're better because they have more variety and better tasting hot sauces. And boy are they hot! Their prices are very comprable to Robertos pretty much the same. They have one combo plate that can feed two people. Full size, your choice burrito with one enchilada and rice and beans. With tax it comes out to $7. The wait isn't long either for takeout."}
{"text":"A couple of months ago Roberto's raised their prices, a lot.  This place is just down the street from us so we went to check it out.  Let me just say, we went back the next day!  The food was so good and so affordable.  My wife and I both got combos with a giant burrito and an enchilada and we ate for $15.  The service is good and the place is kept clean.  It's really small though and gets crowded at the entrance because the counter is only like 4 feet from the front door.  I heard a few people calling in orders so we will probably start doing the same and taking food home since it is so close."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! I'm a huge fan of mom and pops places and this one nailed it for Mexican food. Carne asada and carnitas street tacos are delicious. Chili relleno is wonderful and so are the enchiladas. I'm still trying everything but it seems you can't go wrong with whatever you order. Think local support local and you will always be satisfied!!!"}
{"text":"As a native San Diegan, it's a great feeling to find a quality taco shop! Tried this place tonight and it taste like home! Meat was well seasoned, burritos full of meat, beans and rice are good too! Service was great too! Will definitely be back - I stopped messin around with the other well known taco shop chain."}
{"text":"Once again Gerardo's has exceeded my expectations.  The quality and quantity of their food is the best in town. Super service that has never disappointed me.  Hope this does not gross you out, but I also like to judge any place I go on their restrooms.  Gerardo's get 5  s for theirs.  Needless to say, but they are my favorite  place."}
{"text":"Really great tacos and good salsa bar! Great flavors in everything! 2nd favorite taco shop!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos! I haven't had anything else here except the tacos, because every time I come I HAVE to get the tacos! I love the crispy ground beef, but I haven't had a bad one yet.... the Carne Asada, Carnitas, and Al Pastor are all delicious. My least favorite was the chicken, but still wasn't bad. The salsa's in the salsa bar are really good, but every time I have been the salsa bar was messy, could use a little TLC."}
{"text":"very good tasting food, they need someone that is bi lingual and understands English, nice and clean. Its real Mexican dishes and not too pricey"}
{"text":"My favorite tacos in town! Super nice people too! Even my son loves is and he is super picky! Lol"}
{"text":"Finally, a better option than Roberto's! I haven't tried Jefe's yet, but will soon. Otherwise, this place is amazing. This intersection should be famous for great tacos, b/c it's right across from Jefe's. Gerardo's had quick and friendly service. The tacos were delish! Just what the NW side needs."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE PLACE TO GET A KILLER California burrito and veggie burrito!  The prices are insanely good for the quality and size of burrito.  For these two burritos we paid between 11-13 bucks.  He piles on the toppings (lots of meat) and does not skimp.  He has great customer service and is so kind and respectful to each customer.  His hot sauces are HOTTTT!  I am def coming back here for all my burrito needs.  This is by far the best burritos I've had in Las Vegas!  Also, if you ask for jalape√±os, he deep fries to big ones for you and serves it up on the side.  My kind of spicy! Don't go to El Jefes...come here instead and you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've had in years!!!! It's seasoned and full of flavor! The Carne Asada is a 10! The chicken is moist. The ground beef is also yummy! Thank you for seasoning your food and thank you for charging fair prices and not ripping your customers off."}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall place packed with really good food. The carnitas were so good! I am definitely going back to try the other things like beef tongue and cheek! And their pickled onions and green sauce were excellent. I would have taken tubs of those to go with me if I could. The rice could have been better quality but that's my only real complaint which is pretty minor."}
{"text":"I don't recommend eating here, went there for lunch didn't tip because I didn't have enough, cashier gave me attitude because I didn't the cook asked her if I tipped she said no so he had attitude and my food took forever and I had a out 3 strands of cheese in my tacos each. Worst customer service ever!"}
{"text":"Best TACOS EVER!!!  I had lengua and buche, man they were cooked so perfect! I really enjoyed their tacos and how nice they were! Definitely coming back to these whenever I come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall sort of place which can make for some of the best food. I had the burrito combo and was very happy. Two big burritos wrapped in corn tortillas. If your into Americanized from of this isn't your place. It's a mostly take out place that also has a couple tables so you can eat there."}
{"text":"I've ordered here several times now and no matter what you tell them you want it won't happen.If you tell them you want cheese they will never put it in the burrito. if you tell them you want extra of something that won't happen either. they won't give you what you want and the food is always dry. So if you're desperate then go here."}
{"text":"This place is better than Roberto's. Quick service and good selection of salsas. Ordered the chicken and beef tacos. Tacos were excellent as well as the rice and beans. We will definitely come back."}
