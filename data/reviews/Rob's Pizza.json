{"text":"I won a gift card from a raffle to robs pizza and was excited to use after what I had heard.  My family was shopping at the shop and save, so I ran in and placed my order. I explained how many were in my party--and asked for advice on what size to get. They not only showed me visual sizes (which is great, I'm a visual person).. they helped me make the best choice for me and my family. I got the pizza home, and it was delicious. It was better than the normal place we go to here in town! We will definitely be going back here again!! The pizza itself was great, the service was fantastic too!"}
{"text":"Thirty years, same owner, same location.  That says a lot!  Rob's been making pizza since his high school days and it shows.  Good pizza!  Good hoagies!  The only drawback is that he's been so successful in his career that he has limited hours and does not deliver.  Good job Rob!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. 
Great price.
The inside is kinda outdated and warm. 
Don't think the place has ac. 
Drink selection is small. 
I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a reasonably priced pie with pretty good taste."}
{"text":"Had this pizza and would honestly put Dominos and Pizza Hut well ahead of this place. As far as Murrysville pizza places go I'd put Rob's right behind Cosmos, Murrysville Pizza Co., Fox's, Mama P's, 3 Rivers Six Pack and Donna Lynn's. So basically last."}
{"text":"The county health dept needs to degrade this ant infested pizza shop. The cheese was gray and not melted. The sausage tasted like it had freezer burn. I recommend to drive into the city of pittsburgh and eat at Mineos. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"First time to try it and the buffalo pizza is the bomb!!! Fresh ingredients and the crust is really good!!"}
