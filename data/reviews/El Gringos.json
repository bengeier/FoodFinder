{"text":"The new kid on the block in Boro.
We have a few Mexican restaurants in town, but now we have the popular chain of north Yorkshire eateries in El Gringos. 
It has the perfect selection of food and is In the heart of student town so has great deals on in the week.
Had an amazing fajita meal and with the best tequila I had tasted in a long while.
Best in town"}

{"text":"We were really looking forward to El Gringos as we wanted to see Scarborough's take on Mexican food. Firstly the menu.... It's more Tex Mex with a Caribbean and Cajun thrown in. Well, that's what it said. What we received ( and I am being kind here) was slop with coriander and lime juice.

Firstly the order was wrong, but despite that the chicken was undercooked and black beans cold. The overall assessment was that this was poorly cooked and didn't reflect in any way anything like Mexican / Cajun / Caribbean food. 

The staff were all young and were really nice as a positive, but is think this as the case in the kitchen too as whoever cooked our meal must have been inexperienced. In fairness the supervisor offered to reduce the bill, however, this didnt cover the fact we were served well below par meals.

We were really disappointed, but there you have it. Its rare that I vow never to return to a restaurant but this is one exception."}
{"text":"It's what you'd expect from a chain tex-mex restaurant.   Big tables for groups, spacious and laminated menus. The waitresses are very attentive and nice. I ordered the chicken and beef fajitas, which were good, but not the best I had. The side dishes you usually get with fajitas were a bit too small, not enough cheese and no guacamole :( and no rice or refried beans.
But price-wise it was ok.
My girlfriend had the marinated salmon which was better than expected.

They should do something about the ventilation, because the smoke from the grill in the kitchen was wafting into the restaurant.

If you're craving for tex-mex you should go though, but don't expect a family owned Mexican restaurant."}
