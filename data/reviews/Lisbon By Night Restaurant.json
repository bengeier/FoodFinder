{"text":"The fish and seafood here is delicious and according to my Portugese friends, very authentic. If you choose the AYCE fish option (now $25 I think), it's an AMAZING deal. Basically 8 platters of fish or seafood (types depend on season) that come one at a time freshly cooked from the grill. Pace yourself so that you can get to the 8th one. There's a LOT of food. Plus the rice, salsa and potatoes are delicious too and you have to keep stopping yourself from the sides so that you still have room for the fish. 

The place feels like a throwback to some neighbourhood club which gives it all the more ambience. There are usually performers there on weekends, and the corner glass window gives an amazing view of the Toronto skyline. 

The seafood soup here alone is worth coming for, but the grilled fish, calamari, shrimp etc are making my mouth water just thinking about it."}
{"text":"The all you can eat grilled seafood dinner is a great deal which starts with soup and comes with rice, beans, veg - all for $30.   Kind of like the Brazilian steakhouse but with 10 types of seafood including snapper, tuna, salmon, shrimp (my fav - so flavorful), squid/calamari and others - give yourself plenty of time as they grill each type of fish individually and bring to the table fresh from the grill. 

It's very quiet mid-week but very busy on Fri/Sat nights -big parties and live music. 

I haven't tried the other menu items because the unlimited seafood choice is so good - so review is only based on this.   But worth a try as I don't think many restaurants offer this. Obviously at this price you won't get the best quality of fish but it's always very good and well prepared. 

Excellent service from the always friendly staff - nice quiet spot for mid-week and a fun lively/loud place for wknd nights."}
{"text":"From all the Portuguese places I've been in Toronto! This is the best restaurant I've been in. The food is fresh and the cooks know how to cook. Also their is entertainment with the singer with English songs and Portuguese. It's a must for restaurant lovers. I tried most of the dishes and no complaints. Always fantastic"}
{"text":"We went for the fish special offered on Friday night... and it happened to be a special event night, with live music and singing (they have live entertainment every week, but this was special enough to stop the kitchen service while they were performing).  If you are a fan of seafood... look no further.  It doesn't matter if you are a fan of traditional Portugese cuisine, if you order anything from the seafood menu, you won't be disappointed.  Its the kind of food that can stop an argument.  The entertainment was exciting too, and highly cultural... a great experience, we would definitely go back (on a normal night, albeit)."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday. Used to go here every year as a kid for my Grandmother's birthday. Raised Portuguese and this place used to be the definitive spot for authentic food. Sigh. Times have changed.

I ordered the Bacalhau casa because I'm told it's a portion of cod fish, pan fried and topped with tomatoes and onions. Great! In reality, it's an enormous portion of salted cod which has been deep fried. It's tough and leathery and far too salty. There's an art to desalting salted cod fish! I manage to eat a quarter of my meal. There's so many potatoes and so much fish, I'm tempted to share it with the table across from us considering the waitress is yelling at them because they want to know what kind of fish will be served if they order the 'all you can eat'.

Dessert was awful. Initially I order the flan. They forgot to make it. So I order the creme caramel with the caveat that if it's not baked properly, I'm returning it. Our waitress assures us \"the creme caramel is very good here\". It's over baked and more like scrambled eggs.

Last time here for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent Food
Excellent Service
Great looking medium to large size restaurant

They start you off with a large basket of breads served with olive oil and butter.

The all you can eat seafood is extremely filling with a variety of good quality fish, and they just keep coming to you with more every few minutes (you have to ask the waiter to either slow down or stop brining out the food at some point)

Service by the entire staff is top notch. 

Live music was not too loud when I was there, perfect for having a conversation with music playing in the background.

(Only complaint I have is that the coffee cup had lipstick on it). I'd definitely go back there!!

I was there on a not so busy Friday night (long weekend), however the place gets full and requires reservation on weekends."}
{"text":"My partner's birthday today. We decided to give this restaurant a try as recommended by our friends. Food was great.  All you can eat fish. Served on veriaty of fresh fish.  Server will bring on different kinds of fishes from time to time to choose from. Stuffed before he finished the last round. Also included soup and salad and grilled pineapple... service was great. Live band. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant! We've been here countless times..their all you can eat fish (and some other types of seafood) is great plus we've tried their seafood stew which was delicious!! Great staff!"}
{"text":"The whole fish was amazing, sea bream. The large shrimps were a little over cooked. Otherwise the place is a fine dining environment on the second floor, and there was some live music in the background. Nice place would recommend it."}
{"text":"I would give this place negative infinity stars if I could. 

We went for WInterlicious and I checked the reviews and thought okay this place sounds pretty good. I made a reservation two weeks in advance and we arrived exactly 3 minutes late. The hostess told us it would be 15 minutes for our table. 30 minutes later, still no table. They gave us a tiny two person table to sit at while waiting and eventually we got tired of waiting and just asked if we could sit there. The hostess made it sound like she was doing us a favour by letting us sit there and didn't apologize. As I looked around the restaurant and observed her talking to the guests, the more and more I thought she had just given our table to one of her friends. If you've read the other reviews, you will know that there is a small stage there. When the live musician started playing, we were so crammed into the corner, he was literally playing into my friend's ear. 

The food was all lukewarm and the quality was similar to cafeteria food. I actually gagged and wanted to throw up when I ate one of the sardines. They served our food like they were rushing us out. Now that I think about it I don't know why we stayed and didn't just get up and leave. 

When it came to pay our bill, our server didn't understand that we wanted to split the bill and we had to wait a long time for the hostess who I guess is also the manager to come and just split our bill in three.

All in all a TERRIBLE experience. Will NEVER come back."}
{"text":"Just had their lunch winterlicious menu, the location and atmosphere is not too bad.
food is is a bit over burn which i can accept that for the price.
BUT THEY CHARGE $2 FOR A SLICE OF LEMON WITH HOT WATER FOR EACH OF US!!! 
*I asked them nicely to fix the bill and they insist to charge me by saying it's a lemon water. should just order a juice or sth instead...
Never want to go back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant has good food. They have all you can eat fish rodizio for $29, which is a great price. It came with delicious fish soup and fresh fish. Unfortunately the service was very, very slow. We got there at 7:30 (had reservations). Waited 1 hour for our appetizers. 2 hours for our entrees. Ended up leaving at 11:30. It was the second time i went there and had slow service. 

They ran out of bread... Which is unheard of at a Portuguese restaurant. They ended up getting more bread after. They also ran out of one of the desserts we asked for.

In conclusion, great food, but experience ruined by slow service."}
{"text":"Went there for Winterlicious 2011! 
I wanted to have Portuguese food for a change!
So it is located on Dundas St W which seems like a bit creepy at night but that's okay!lol
The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of a building, the stairs you take are very tight, and as far as I am concerned I have not seen any lift for wheelchairs or strollers.
When my friend and I arrived there we thought we were in the middle of a family festivity (e.g. communion or wedding). The place is huge, there is a stage and all the tables are set very close to each others (I think they train their waiters so that they know how to serve properly and carefully while navigating through the restaurant!lol).
The waitress we had was very nice and funny! She liked doing jokes! 
So now the food: very good presentation, quantity seems a little but you get full easily because in most of the meals there are a lot of olive oil and potatoes. The cook of the meat, fishes and vegetables were as announced in the Winterlicious menu!
There was a musician/singer on the stage and a guy playing piano, he sang English, Portuguese, Italian and Spanish songs! Tha was fun! And there were 2 birthdays, so all the restaurant sang Happy Birthday!
It was an enjoyable moment there! Good food, good atmosphere and at a good price thanks to Winterlicious!

But will come back when I can afford it!lol"}
{"text":"I had the Seafood Paella with my wife.  It was TERRIBLE.  They also put beef and chicken in a seafood paella.  It was also overcooked and the rice was uncooked.  I can't understand how this place stays in business cooking food like this and charging close to $63 for this dish?"}
{"text":"The night started out well enough. We ordered dinner and it took a bit of time for appetizer to arrive but they were yummy. The main courses were very good and quite authentic. Then the wheels fell off, the service became non existent. The music started but would have been nice to have more Portuguese rather that North American songs. As the night when the service became worse. Ordered the dessert were very disappointing . My daughter ordered a lava cake and the care and chocolate lava cake that was burnt including these sauce it inedible. My espresso was also burnt and un drinkable. Disappointing so much potential and everything that went wrong was totally avoidable"}
{"text":"For me, it's as much about the service as the food. The food is always tasty (I'll admit I'm not a fan of their basic rice dish, though - never tried the paella), everything else I've had was delightful - seafood platter, grilled sardines, grilled vegetables, the portuguese steak with a fried egg on it and fresh, *home-made* chips to round it off! The fish soup was tasty, as was every dessert I've tried.

Is it authentic Portuguese? How would *I* know? It's good.

But more than the food, it's the service that rocks. The staff are attentive without hovering all over you, they don't necessarily overwhelm you with fake friendliness, but they do an excellent job of taking care of you. They even managed to squeeze us in without reservations during Summerlicious (the place was fully booked and I'd not had the foresight to reserve!)"}
{"text":"Made reservatioms but was running late. Called ahead of time and gave name and what time we were scheduled. When we got there our table was given  up to someone else. We were told we would get a table in ten minutes. Ended up being 40 minutes. While waiting like a bunch of stooges no one really assured us our table was near ready.  Waitress was nice but overall the experience wasn't good. Would not go back."}
{"text":"I came to try this restaurant's Summerlicious menu and was very disappointed.  The Summerlicious menu was no reflection of any of the dishes on their regular menu and it was apparent that the restaurant simply put together a list of entrees created from low cost ingredients, then marketed the entrees as gourmet creations.  As an example, one of the entrees was penne pasta mixed with cut vegetables (I can create that in my own kitchen!)  To add insult to injury, the waitress \"accidentally\" charged us $25 each for the Summerlicious dinner menu, when it should have been $15 for the lunch  menu.  If this was the restaurant's attempt to draw customers, it failed miserably."}
{"text":"Nestled in the heart of Little Portugal, Lisbon By Night is *the* place to be for authentic Portguese cuisine. The decor may be a little outdated, but I find this restaurant to be extremely cozy and inviting (especially at the dinner hour) and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the culinary works of art they serve up here. The menu is really eclectic, so much so that you'll have to make several visits to Lisbon By Night to understand the full spectrum of textures, flavours and aromas that are available there. 

From what I understand, they also offer catering services and a banquet hall that seats 120 people on the uppermost level.  So this is also an option for people looking for quality catering or a place to host a function.

The price is very reasonable for a sit-down. My problem is that the atmosphere is so cozy and relaxing, I never want to leave....and the wine just keeps coming. I'm not sure how late they're open, but I've ordered an elaborate dessert at midnight once before and they were so cool about it...like they do it all the time.

So to recap, the food is fantastic and so is the atmosphere. I really enjoyed myself here and would recommend it as one of the best places in Toronto to find authentic Portuguese cuisine."}
{"text":"Had dinner there this weekend and loved it - I have been here before and the food is always great, the decor is \"Old World Charm\" haha but it works and the live music is entertaining.  The food is delicious and the service is top notch and lets face it, that's really all that matters.  Dinner for 4 with drinks, dessert and coffee's was very reasonable if not cheap - which was great seeing as I got stuck with the bill :("}
{"text":"Some friends are big fans ot LIsbon by Night. It is really a nice restaurant, nice atmosphere. But I didn't enjoy the food and the music - we were not there in one fo the Fado's show. The night we went there, they had a singer and an electronic keyboard - loud, noisy, annoying. The only thing that was great about the \"rodizio\" was the price. I confess that the bread was marvelous and the soup was good."}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicious on a Sunday night. It was empty. We reserved for 7pm with group of 5. Only 6 tables were filled. The live music was horrible. Not sure if its the owner doing it himself, but at least have some sense to tune it down. Everyone was screaming over his singing and clapping out of courtesy.

The food was bland. Here's a list to what we had:
Calamari - The best one. Full of delicious butter. It just taste like butter, not squid. But it was cooked well and not tough.
Sardines - They didn't gut the fish. At least it wasn't fishy. 
Grilled Veggies - Came out lukewarm, closer to cold.

Pork with clams - The pork was dry, the clams tasted fishy. 
Seafood Risotto - It should be called rice soup. I know it's supposed to be liquidy 'cause it's Portugese style, but the amount was ridic. 
Grilled Fish- It was seared nicely. Good dish.

Passion fruit flan - More like flavoured gum.
Creme Caramel - It wasn't smooth. My 14 year old niece can make a better one.
Portuguese Custard - I don't think this should be called that. I can find better ones in Kensington market.
Honestly, dessert is not their strong point. 

The food wasn't even Portuguese food. It lacked the flavour and smokey seasonings that it should have. They food is typical average restaurant food and shouldn't be charged at that price. I think because the lack of Portuguese cuisine, and Lisbon seems the be the only one advertising consistently, that people come here for a Portuguese experience. It's like, for example, going to Jack Astor's and get served wonton noodle soup and had to eat it with a fork.

The only good thing was the waiter was super attentive. Great service, until the other one came and replaced him."}
{"text":"I came here after great recommendations from my mom. Sad to say the food was nothing special. The chicken alfredo was awful. The roasted vegetables were good, as was the potatoes. The side rice and chick pea salad was alright. This place is known for their all you can eat seafood. For the price it's worth the money, but the fishes were not out of this world. 

Overall, i wish I had gone elsewhere for dinner before dishing out $$$$ here."}
{"text":"Came for summerlicious menu with some girlfriends.  Cute hidden resto with great service & tasty food. Will def come back!"}
{"text":"I came here on valentines day and we started with calamari which was really good! and the shared a seafood paella which could have been enough for 4 people. It was really good the atmosphere was nice too. They make really good drinks we had a pitcher of long island ice tea and a pitcher of sangria. I would definitely go back to try the all you can eat seafood dinner."}
{"text":"We went for the AYCE Fish Rodizio and it was  an excellent experience.  They had a very good selection of perfectly grilled fish to sample and some decent sides.  The wine list provided a great opportunity to sample some bargain priced portuguese bottles.  

They had  an interesting stage show which consisted of a one man band singing and playing the keyboards which helped to add some entertainment with our meal."}
{"text":"Great experience! Great dinner!!

We went here for the fish rodizio- AYCE fish special and it was amazing! They start off with fish soup and then have about 7 different types of fish and seafood which they offer that day. The fish, especially the dourada aka sea bream was grilled to perfection. The salmon was also amazing! 

The ambiance is warm and welcoming. There is a nice live band on weekends. The music is great, but it can get a little loud

Overall this restaurant is great value for money. At any other restaurant, the cost of just one of the fish would almost equal the price of this ayce. I am definitely going to return!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday luncheon on Saturday and we were the only diners for the afternoon which makes me wonder what was wrong with this restaurant.

With a name like Lisbon by Night, perhaps it's more of an evening place since they offer entertainment and has a small dancefloor. 

Good thing about having the place to ourselves, it felt like a private dining event and we had the full attention of the server who was the only staff out front, other than the 4 ladies working in the kitchen and perhaps someone who may have been the manager.

The server was very friendly and pleasant which was definitely good since we were celebrating a special occasion and didn't want it marred by bad service.  For someone working the dining room on his own, he managed quite well and always had a smile on his face.

We came specifically for the fish rodizio, but the good thing about this restaurant, they didn't require everyone at the table to order the all-you-can-eat fish rodizio since two friends weren't too hungry or liked fish so they ordered off the menu.

The menu had a vast selection of food with reasonable prices and the fish rodizio was only $24.95 which was a great price since most of the fish dishes range between $20-$30.

Selection of wine was decent with various prices, but we opted for the sangria which was quite delicious, not the best as the menu suggested, but pretty good for $25 per litre.

Bread served was warm and fresh, but we were careful not to fill ourselves up with too much because we all know that one can go overboard with bread.  The friends who ordered off the menu were pleased with their meals and portions were a good size.  I had a sample of the tomato salad which was fresh and lightly drizzled with vinaigrette and topped with sprouts.

The other 4 friends and myself patiently awaited the fish rodizio to start.  We were served a fish soup to begin which was quite tasty and had chunks of white fish in it, but I cannot tell what kind of fish and forgot to ask the server.  The sides served (potatoes, rice and beans, and tomato/cucumber salad) were tasty and flavourful.  Then slowly the fish rodizio started to arrive which was good timing as it came out one dish at a time: seabass, kingfish, monkfish, salmon, calamari, shrimps.  I wonder if there were more options in the evening.

After the first round, the server asked if we wanted any extra fish, which some of us ordered more.  I found the second round was more tasty than the first. My favourite was the seabass and the salmon because it was seasoned well and fish was flaky.

Some of the fish during the first round was a little bland tasting and a bit overcooked, but with lemon and the sides it was edible. Although, I didn't finish all of it like my friends did.   The calamari was bland and didn't taste fresh, it wasn't quite the rubbery taste, but it didn't sit well in my mouth and after a few pieces I just gave up.  My friends didn't have any issues with it, perhaps it's just me being particular, but I love calamari and knew it tasted off or could it be it was from frozen.

The shrimps definitely made up for the lack of flavour of the calamari as the shrimps were seasoned well and cooked in sauce which enhanced the flavour. Plus it was deveined making it an enjoyable experience and not having to see the black remnants of the shrimp in tact was a pretty sight.

Dessert was the grilled pineapple and cinnamon which was served with a knife and fork directly displayed perpendicular on the plate which was quite unusual, but made for a different serving experience. Pineapple smelled like apple pie and it was absolutely delicious.  Only one person in our group ordered coffee and it smelled fresh and aromatic, plus served with a small piece of chocolate.  My friend said it was excellente just like what was displayed inside the cup.

Since it was a friend's birthday, I had brought a cake which the server had refrigerated when I arrived.  Since I forgot to bring candles, the server said that he can take care of it.  He brought out the cake when we were ready and even had happy birthday music playing when he came out with the lit cake.  Our friend was definitely surprised and pleased, plus everyone was happy.  What a good celebration with friends and we had exceptional service.

Overall, Lisbon by Night was an enjoyable dining experience and I would definitely return to try the regular menu and perhaps a dinner fish rodizio so I can experience the live music and see if there are more fish selection. For $24.95, the fish rodizio was good value and the quality of the fish wasn't too bad. Must try again."}
{"text":"Great food and lots of it. Seafood piled high on large platters set on tables that don't have enough room for all of the plates. Never fear, the servers are always attentive clearing away and refilling.  Popular spot for family celebrations. Atmosphere hopelessly dated and the band was intolerably loud and cheesy. I'd go back but never when the band was there."}
{"text":"Lisbon by Night has long been a staple in my family. Still love it. The Fish Rodizio is a great deal and there is lots of fresh seafood. Comes with a fish soup in the beginning and a slice of grilled pineapple at the end. The rest of the menu is also very good. 

I have always had very good luck with the wait staff. Find them all to be very friendly and helpful. 

The only thing I don't get is that they advertise \"Fado\" on Friday nights and it's always some guy singing along on his synthesizer to English music. We try and clear out soon after he starts as he is pretty bad (around 9). It sounds like some guy doing karaoke in his basement. Kinda lame. I would much rather listen to fado and that would add to the portuguese ambience. We've been there several times on a Friday night and have *never* heard fado."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant portugais n'a peut-être pas changé de décor depuis les années soixante-dix, le menu est classique mais le service est excellent et les plats aussi. Les fruits de mer sont particulièrement bien préparés."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in 20 years, not much has changed. 

Went for a birthday and thankfully Winterlicious was on. For what this restaurant is, their regular prices are steep so I definitely appreciated getting a meal for $25. 

So the menu is full of options, and they the cocktail menu seems to go on forever. A separate drinks menu is definitely something to consider. Their prices are on the high side. The food though great isn't the best Portuguese  food to be found in Toronto especially that area. My brother's steak was not cooked to his liking..

As for the service, definitely lacking. Very long wait, even for appetizers. They forgot my husband's calamari, had to flag someone down. When it did come it wasn't presented like the calamari other's ordered. Seemed it was in fact forgotten and they just cooked it up and slapped it on a plate to get it out. My brother ordered jumbo shrimp, never came, the waitress played it off like he never ordered them. She said it would be a while, when they did arrive part way through the entrée he said they were awful. One of my biggest gripes; food not being served to everyone at the same time. It's awkward eating while your husband is waiting in front of you for 15 minutes until his entrée arrives.. The  staff seems to be very quick to move you along, seeing hands reach for my plate while I'm still eating! Taking away my sister in law's wine when a third was remaining, removing another guest's napkin. Very amateur mistakes. For coffee my sister in law's espresso was forgotten.  Good thing they include their tips because if they didn't I would just round up my total. 

The ambiance; well it's dark and dated. So dark it's hard to see if your steak is well cooked. The entertainment; it's light and dated. One man band on a synthesizer is what you can expect. The playlist includes awkward renditions of Lionel Richie, Enrique Iglesias, Ben E King, Spanish classics and Brazilian pop music. His take on Happy Birthday was also, different. 

It was 20 years between visits but I would never have guessed. The ambiance, menu, food and service does command the prices of their dishes."}
{"text":"I wasn't expected to be impressed but I was.  Very hot and fresh grilled fish in just the right sauce, tasty potato fries and proper veg. Nothing too fancy but executed perfectly.  I was here for a large family gathering and I think most people were quite happy with the food.
Nice surprise.  Id go back"}
{"text":"My friend put it best - dining at this restaurant makes you feel like you've crashed the Portuguese version of My Big Fat Greek Wedding. They were slammed on a Friday night, though possibly because Toronto's restaurant week had started that day. The numerous Portuguese families celebrating birthdays definitely added to the chaos and ambiance of the place. Overall the food was good but service was slow. The highlights of my meal by far were the passion fruit pudding and the very reasonably prices bottles of vinho verde, of which our table drank several."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a really good fish and seafood restaurant take the trip to this place. 
Looks a bit odd from the outside, but once you climb the stairs to the first floor you will discover an amazing Portuguese experience. 
The all you can eat grilled fish is fantastic, they serve it with a soup as appetizer and a grilled pineapple for desert.
We were served ten different fish/seafood items. While I didn't like the calamari, all fish entrees were very good. The Sea Bream, Mahi Mahi, Red Snapper and Salmon were delicious. 
The place lacks a bit ambience though, it's dated and a bit dark. 
All in all this has become my wife's and my go to place for fish and seafood, well worth the money."}
{"text":"We went for dinner this evening, and we came out extremely satisfied with the experience. The waitresses were extremely polite and obliging, we didn't wait too long for the food, and it was so delicious!!! What a perfect dinner! Thank you very much Lisbon by Night :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service, great price. 

My family and I have come to Lisbon by night for many different occasions... Birthdays, anniversaries, baptisms, confirmation and for just a night out.
Dalia (the owner) is always so accommodating, super friendly and always present to insure all her customer are happy."}
{"text":"Come hungry if you're getting the Fish Rodizio special. So much food! At $25 it's a great deal for all the selection of fish you get. A bit of a heads up, they are raising the price on it soon to $30, but even then still well worth it."}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious on the weekend. It wasn't packed since it was early.

Food: I ordered the Beet Salad, Grilled Calamari and the Passionfruit Flan. This was a great meal for lunch. The Calamari was perfectly grilled. I'm Chinese and I didn't know Portuguese Cuisine used 'guy-lan' as a garnish. The beet salad is just like any other beet salad. Surprisingly, the flan was my favourite! Great passionfruit flavour, goes down smooth in your mouth."}
{"text":"The waiter I had was terrible.   I just wanted a grilled salmon, grilled shrimp, or even roasted chicken dinner.   He said \"its not on the menu\" and refused to ask the kitchen to make it.  

Prices are quite high for the regular entrees."}
{"text":"We went there on a recent Sunday night, and I gotta say, this was really pretty mediocre. I got the Fish Rodizio, my husband got the Grouper, and it was like cafeteria quality food. My daughter got the garlic/parsley/egg soup, which she described as a cup of olive oil poured on top of some bread and parsley. The decor is kind of old and depressing. I would not go there again"}
{"text":"I was so impressed by the quantity, quality and cost of the gourmet food here!!! Never have I experienced that before! 

Seafood cuisine is absolutely second to none!!! The service shines here, they are very proper with etiquette and promptness. I highly recommend this restaurant for any special function."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious ($28) and I actually quite enjoyed the food. However, we were seated at a corner table and barely had any service all night. We were constantly thirsty and there were so few servers working that we couldn't even flag anyone down. We ended up being there for 3 hours because the courses came out so slowly.

I still enjoyed the experience though. Quality of food was good, and it's one of the better winterlicious meals I've had, and for a very reasonable price. The calamari app was spot on. The main I had the grilled fish, which was good (texture more rough but I think that's the texture of the fish itself and not how it was cooked), and dessert custard tart fell below expectations.

Atmosphere is fancy, and six of us shared a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Aside from screwing up my reservation, I'm very happy with the food and service. 

Came here pre-Valentines with my GF. She loves seafood. We had the all you can eat seafood for $29.95 which is a great deal considering all the stuff you get. Fish is surprisingly filling. After 1 round of everything I was stuffed. The flavors were excellent. I don't remember the fish names but I had maybe 3-4 kinds of fish, shrimp, and squid. Actually we were stuffed because one of the selection was a WHOLE fish. 

This is a good way to do AYCE to maintain quality. They cook it fresh, then bring it to all the tables to ask if customers want. 

To top it off, they have live music. They were singing Portuguese songs and even though I didn't understand, we had a good time."}
{"text":"Visited for my birthday. First impression was that it was a bit smaller than what it appeared to be on their website. I quickly got over that as the service was excellent and the food was even better. They had a large party dining there so it was a bit crowded with some kids running around but I tried my best to overlook that and I'm glad I did. The food was excellent. I'm a seafood lover so they did not disappoint. The seafood platter is a must! It's meant to feed 2 people but can feed 4! And for only $90 it's a steal. The drink menu could be a bit more extensive and the cocktails were a bit too sour for my liking. Overall, I would definitely go back. It's a seafood lover's paradise!! They also have an 8 course market fish meal for $33! That's unheard of!"}
{"text":"I went to Lisbon by Night for a friend who is leaving Toronto so we were a big group of people.
We had the all you can eat menu. I am not a big fan of fish and the menu was pretty much all fish which is not ideal for me but I liked it! Everything was very tasty, service was good. Servers would often come with different plate of fish to fill our plate. There was constantly wine on our table. The only thing maybe some water on the table would have been nice so I didn't have to wait and try to catch a waiter everytime I was thirsty. 

There was people playing traditional portugese music at sone point during the night so that was a nice touch.

3 stars because when came the time to pay I wasn't told the tip was included (contrary to some friends on the other table) on a bill that was expensive for me (hint: all the wine that was split) and I didn't see the bill to notice it therefore I paid the tip twice on a not so cheap bill...I know I should have thought of it but I didn't so..."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now. Once during the week and more recently on Friday. Friday night they had live music which was fun! We ordered a Caesar salad and shared it (2 people) and the seafood platter. The platter was excellent. Service was slower Friday night, but I understand it's because they were busy. We had Spanish coffee at the end of the meal. Wonderful evening. 

Parking can be tricky and we got a ticket."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went on Friday night for the all you can eat fish.  For 24.95 I kinda wondered what the quality would be like and what kind of grilled fish it would be.  So we got
1. half a sea bream each
2. a slice of red snapper (like you would a salmon steak) so a small piece
3. kingfish steak
4. cuttlefish
5. calamari / squid
6 salmon (a chunk of fillet)
7.grouper (a small piece)
8. stickleback (which is larger than a sardine) the entire fish
9. whiting (deep fried)
10. skate (deep fried)
11. pescada (she could only tell me the name in portugese and from what I can tell when I googled it, it's hake) very soft flesh white fish also deep fried
12 shrimp (grilled)
Also the soup, bread, potatoes salad (which my husband described as cucumber salad but with red onions, peppers and tomatoes added) and rice and a grilled pineapple.

I honestly didn't expect this much variety and on top of that I am used to the AYCE sushi places where you have to finish what you have before you get the next dish.  Here she tells me later like at #8 that I don't have to eat everything and it's only when you get to #12 that she asks if I would like a repeat of anything!    

Now had I had known that, I probably wouldn't had finished the red snapper.  It was not as fresh as the sea bream.  The sea bream was fabulous.  Though if you're not a fish eater, you may not like having to pick the bones out!  They were still intact despite me getting half and hubby the other half of the fish. I'm Asian, so I don't really care as I am used to picking the bones out of fish.

The cuttlefish and squid were grilled beautifully, ie. not rubbery at all!  
It's a great deal for anyone who loves fish.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quantity and the quality.  I saw some other people order other dishes that looked really good as well.  So this is a definite place to try out again.

It's definitely old school in that the decor is dated but with prices like this for fish, I can't complain.  I had only heard of it from the advertising I had seen on the TTC bus shelters.  I kept seeing it and thinking, how good could it be?  Good enough!

p.s. I also had bought a coupon as well so I got $40 worth of food for $19 and just paid the difference.  Another reason why I wanted to give it a shot."}
{"text":"Checked out Lisbon by Night this evening.  Didn't even look at the menu, just sat down and ordered the $20 AYCE grilled seafood.

The previous reviews about the decor and live entertainment being a bit dated were absolutely correct, but the service is pleasant and the food is plentiful.  This makes the decor easy to ignore ;)  

My only negative on the meal was that all the seafood seemed to be drizzled with oil or butter (oil I think), which I could really have done without.  In hindsight I'm sure I could have asked for it to be served without the oil and it wouldn't have been a problem.  Something to remember for next time.

I didn't have desert, but the table beside me had chocolate mousse and creme broule - both looked pretty good.

Finished my meal with an espresso (which came with a small chocolate square).  Just right.

Would go again."}
{"text":"We went there last night for my parents 59th wedding anniversary. We had the all you can eat fish and it was totally spectacular!  Sampled 10 different types of fish and had the most amazing waitress Rita. She went out of her way to make us feel comfortable. Will definitely be going back when my fish craving kicks in again. Definitely a must go to restaurant if you like fish."}
{"text":"A very sad attempt at an AYCE menu. Seafood that only a Portuguese peasant would like, seriously over cooked, charred on the grill and low cost selection of fish. The only thing edible were the shrimps which came as the finale. I guess there are folks who will eat cuttlefish, but they certainly didn't show up Friday night. Only 3 tables occupied and the other 2 tables really interested in drinking, not serious seafood. They do have a regular menu, and according to the waitress we should concentrate on it."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves the best Portuguese cuisine in town!

It is known for their outstanding seafood!   We had the all you an eat fish and all I can say is amazing!

You will not be disappointed!   Try the Super Bock beer as it works well with all Portuguese dishes!

5 star!"}
{"text":"This place was simply amazing!  I can't find other words aside from that.  The food, service,  ambience.. Everything was above and beyond... 

Thank you so much Alper and Sara! Everything was beyond amazing... The seafood platter, the mixed meat platter, everything worked like a perfect marriage!!! Perfect to the T with freshness, price and everything else... Nothing I could  say about this place that could minus a star, the ambience and live music matched our wants and needs... This place makes you feel like you are in Portugal! 

The portions, the taste everything exceed our expectations!  I would be delighted to bring my friends here without a doubt! 

All in all, a bit a place too come back we without doubt or questions! 

Just feet your butt here and stuff + your faces!! 

With love, 

From Lisbon by night!!"}
{"text":"A very delayed post....
Came here for summerlicious on a Saturday night. There's was nothing on the exterior of the building indicating that there was a restaurant so I had no idea what to expect. Once I walked through the doors, there were two small flights of stairs leading to the entrance. I was pleasantly surprised with the interior of the restaurant. It was slightly classy with a subtle feel of old elegance. After briefly chatting with the waiter, I learned that the restaurant has been around for over 20 years. 
They had a decent cocktail menu with reasonably priced sangria pitchers (~$25). I went with three others so we were able to each order something different from the summerlicious menu. 
We enjoyed all the dishes, my personal favourite was the grouper. The desserts were plated nicely and couldn't complain about any particular item. They have live music on certain nights and luckily it was on the night we were there. The music definitely was a plus...they even sang Dispacito. All in all it was pleasant experience and definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I went to Lisbon by Night last night with my family to celebrate a birthday.  After a slow start on the service, the night overall was wonderful (service and food).  

Two of the guests at the table chose the $20 all you can eat fish/seafood selection on the menu.  This $20 AYCE option is available seven nights a week.  Both guests are big eaters and to my surprise, could barely finish what they were given.  In addition to 10 types of fish, they also got soup, salad, rice and shaved pineapple at the end.  

Two other people ordered/shared the seafood paella and steamed muscles.  The paella was huge and there was a lot of seafood in the dish.  While not as spicy as some of the Spanish paella, this portugese dish was great.  They agreed that they didn't need to order an app along with the main. 

Finally, I ordered the grilled salmon.  The portion was so large, I could not finish it either.  Partially because I had the olives, cheeses and bread as an app which is super filling but on the side of the fish was potatoes and string beans.  All plentiful.  

For the birthday, the waitress brought cheesecake on the house and sang happy birthday which was a nice touch. 

Overall, the restaurant has a lively atmosphere, high quality food, tasty, large portions of fish and sides.  I would definitely go back with a group.  If you are looking for portugese food in Toronto, Lisbon by Night is not one to miss."}
{"text":"After walking up and down a few times, we finally opened the correct door.. Lol.  It was packed, luckily we got a reservation.  We ordered the ayce fish.  It was good value, come with soup and side.  The first few rounds of serving was excited.  After that it got kind of boring.  They only put salt on the fish and grill or fries it.  Shrimp and squid adds some kick but the taste was boring (actually there was no taste other than salt).  I hope there was some variety to the seasoning and the way they cook the different kind of fish.  The way it is, it missed my wow list."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Located on the second floor on Dundas, it has nice window to a beautiful view of the city. We were a group of 7 people and had reserved ahead of time for a Saturday dinner. The place was packed with different party groups. Very lovely place with a great live band who played and sang all night. Few people even came up to the mini dance floor to bust a move to the lovely music. Service was great. We all chose the all-you-can-eat seafood option for $30 (this is not on the menu, ask for it!) The meal came with a fish soup, few variety of grilled fishes, calamari, shrimp and grilled pineapple. Food was fantastic. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and atmosphere. Table ordered steak, chicken, veal, salmon and Cornish hen.. Everything cooked to perfection and plated beautifully!"}
{"text":"Was curious about Portuguese food and decided on this place for summerlicious and read a lot of review before doing so.  My sister got the 7oz Portuguese Steak, delicious.  I ordered the Shrimp Casserole and loved it.  

The reviews were right on the money about the Grouper.  The outer layer was burnt and fish slightly overcooked (slightly disappointed since Portuguese food is big on fish).

However, service was good and attentive despite the busy environment. 

We were asked if we wanted refills for the bread to which we agreed on.  The bread combined with the stacked bottle containing balsamic vinegar and olive oil was one of the many highlights of the the starter to the meal.

The musician played a few classic songs during the meal on his keyboard to which I did not mind.  He had a tiny disco light shooting hearts and start patterns into the ceiling which was a bonus.  It's not a bad place to take your significant other on a date, maybe even dance to a few songs, but I wish he played more.  

Aside from that, he played the birthday song a few times as there were a few being celebrated.  The atmosphere was lively and everyone joined in to sing and clap for the embarrassed birthday man/woman.

For the price that you pay the amount and quality of food and service cannot be dismissed.  If you avoid the Grouper, this place will give you a run for your money."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Summerlicious 2015 led me to Lisbon by Night Restaurant, as my family wanted to try some Portuguese dining, as we rarely eat authentic Portuguese food outside Macau.

The restaurant is on top of a flight of stairs, so if you can't walk up stairs...sorry you're out of luck (I took away a half-star there). Also, I reserved for a Sunday night at 7:30pm and the place was full house...so if you don't reserve, chances are you'll have to wait for a table.

This place is probably one of the few places that offer quite a large range of options for Summerlicious. I ordered the grilled calamari in wine garlic sauce, seafood risotto, and the fresh cream with sweet egg. I found them all to be very good, with my only complaint being that a couple of mussel shells would not open, meaning they were undercooked. However, my dad's Portuguese steak was overcooked, as he asked for medium rare and received a medium well steak. He also felt that the steak was quite thin, and for a $25 set course it could've been of a higher quality.

Service was great the whole way, and I found the waitresses overall to be able to keep up with the Summerlicious demand in this restaurant.

Will I return? Perhaps to try other things, but I am open to any better Portuguese restaurants in the GTA."}
{"text":"I had high hopes when I made a Summerlicious reservation over the weekend. I was sold by the friendly lady on the phone who took my reservation and my number. 

We were a party of 3; we became a little giddy when the gentleman who greeted us asked us to pick a table in the middle of the restaurant and walked away. When one of us suggested (amongst ourselves, because we were not attended to, and we're still standing) by the window. A pitchy lady came by quickly and asked us loudly if she could help us.

Anyhow, so we got a table by the window and has a very polite server. Unfortunately politeness does not cut it when you are not all that attentive. We had to wait for her to appear and wave her down to get water on numerous occasions.  We also noticed at this restaurant, the servers only refill water for their assigned tables.

The apps were great- we had Caldo Verde, Grilled sardines ( just how I remembered them on our trip to Portugal), and Grilled Calamari.

We then had a very homey tasting steak (the gravy- soaked sliced potatoes were also delist!), a lukewarm Grilled Grouper, and also a lukewarm plate of very chewey Pork Aletejana- maybe the kitchen was not able to multi task?

Then came dessert time!! We had the creme caramel, and two egg custard tarts ( natas). They were okay, ive had better in Montreal, and of course can't compare to the ones in Belem!

Also, I was the only drinker in the group and asked for a glass of sangria. Our server had no intention to accommodate and said it only comes in half a litre or a full litre. 

Definitely won't visit again."}
{"text":"On our girls night out, we decided to try Portuguese food during Winterlicious. It is in an old building with a lovely chandelier hanging on the top floor as you make you way to the second floor. Ambiance is nice with live Spanish music. 

I ordered Sardines for appetizer and got surprised on how big the serving but tastes is just ok. For main course I had seafood rice. Lots of ingredients and really tasty. Funny, how the waiter brought out a huge long pepper mill and asks us if we want some added to our food. Lastly i had passion fruit flan for dessert and love the light refreshing taste. 

Service is good and staff are attentive and nice. Overall experience is good!"}
{"text":"This is a review of the \"Rodizio\" at LBN. 
We went on Thursday @ 4 pm and the restaurant was empty.  The service was great, the price is $30 pp. We didn't quite understand the plated buffet idea, they bring you small portions of your desired grilled seafood until you are full. They begin with a fish soup and a platter of bread, and have potatoes, rice/beans, & salsa as sides. They are all very, very delicious. BUT, you cannot take anything home, so if you really like seafood, you should actually not eat any of these delicious things!! That's how they fill you up, so there is no room for fish in your belly LOL! All of the seafood was super good quality and cooked perfectly.  We tried everything since it was our first time. Jumbo shrimp, octopus, calamari, salmon, & king fish were on point. When we return, we'll probably bypass the sides and go straight to the grilled fish goods and repeat the ones we like the best. Jackfish-not so great, and sardines were not there. Thursday happens to be 1/2 price wine, we got a good Niagara house white bottle for $20. For about $100 we got a very VERY good meal and will return again. I was going to remove a star for the reason that the restaurant is about 3 stories up a flight of stairs, so for babies, old folks, or handicap (my Dad's in a wheelchair) this restaurant is 100% INACCESSIBLE. But I won't because, I don't think it's fair towards the meal. I'm not sure if there is an elevator, but I didn't see one."}
{"text":"I have been to LbN twice now. The food was incredible both times. I have yet to try the AYCE fish platter, but I can attest to the Carne de Porco a Alentejana which was phenomenal. The fried potatoes don't get any better. While the dish was a bit salty for my taste, the generous servings and use of cilantro makes it a must have...again.

The salsa garnish/marinade on the Bacalhau a Casa was also delicious. And for an appetizer, the grilled vegetable platter and calimari (not fried and not rubbery!) were perfect to share among 5 of us.

The extensive wine list also allows for reasonably priced options to pair with your dinner.

I'd highly recommend LbN for the food and service."}
{"text":"I found this gem this winter when looking at the 'Winterlicious' website. Great place for authentic home cooked style Portuguese food. Generous portions, great service and a very good wine list. If you love fish, seafood, steak, pork and stew dishes this is the place for you. A party of two can have a great meal with drinks for $50 to $75. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, I will definitely be going back here!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time in June and hadn't written a review.Both myself and my bf received the AYCE fish, I loved it. I haven't had some of these things since I went to Portugal, My bf loves seafood and also liked the fish. They brought out everything one at a time, pretty quick. We got to try everything once and then they asked what we would like to get again which was nice. Came with small sides for the two of us, which i liked because I didn't want to fill up on the sides. CORN BREAD mmmmm love it. I am actually going again this weekend. Can't wait.......................so that was then this is now....i've been a few more times and twice i went when it was \"summerlicious\" my mistake. They don't offer the AYCE fish during this time, so we had to order off the regular menu or summerlicious menu, we choose summerlicious. I ordered the white Sangria and it was so delicious more then the red. The food was okay. I just went again this past weekend and oredered off the summerlicious menu this time again (different year) took some people that had come into town and wanted to go somewhere nice. I got the bacahlao a braz... and it tasted like nothing.....how is that possible. It was very oily and didn't have any salt and pepper i'm sure. Which is which bc cod is a salty fish. It was a small portion which tried to be hidden by the fact it came with a pile of arugula so bitter with some \"drops\" of balsamic on it. i will come back here for the AYCE fish but never again to order off the menu, for seafood ilhas de bruma is better."}
{"text":"My group came here for winterlicious for dinner. The place had a very homely ambiance with the vintage furniture and lighting, with live music (guitarist and singer performing some pop classic covers). I had the grilled fish as a main. It was enjoyable for the most part but a touch overcooked for me (largely tender, stringy and somewhat dry at the periphery). Service was friendly, but a little on the slow side, forgetting one or two drinks on multiple occasions. Overall, I'd come back to try their all you can eat grilled fish option and their regular menu."}
{"text":"This is my first time to go a Portuguese restaurant so I can't exactly say this is my favorite amongst all of them but I can honestly say that the seafood here is amazing. Their seafood is fresh and grilled splendidly. Their calamari and shrimps were cooked to perfection, they know how to cook seafood, that's for sure. They have Wednesday 9cad tapas which was awesome and fish rodizio for 30 bucks. The service is great and their selection of wine is extensive too. Ambience is very warm and cozy. You just feel relaxed the moment you step into the restaurant. I will definitely come back here, and it has to be on a friday or a weekend to witness the live music! Thumbs up for their seafood!"}
{"text":"For the price this was so just not worth it, I ordered the Portugal steak - it was fatty. The potatoes where great!!  It was just not the place for me, there are other brillant places here on Toronto that are fantatic for Portuguese cuisine."}
{"text":"Let me start off, the food was just GREAT.  The group I had ordered the house classic (fried seafood with something which tasted good but I forgot the name of) and a steak with potatoes, 2 jumbo shrimps and good veggies.  The steak was so tender.  Potatoes were perfect.  And the house special was unbelievably good.  And plus the service was good.  They were nice, funny and enjoyable to talk to.  Definitely coming back, maybe to try there sea food."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!?

Winterlicious is over but if summerlicious comes back around, order the calamari if it's on the menu! The seafood rice is definitely a hit for a main with a lot of seafood in the rice! The natas do Céu for dessert was different than the typical Portuguese tart that I was familiar with and tasted good too. 

This restaurant is very cozy. It's located on the second floor on Dundas street west. If you don't mind a home-y like meal, the restaurant offers sizeable portions for the price you pay. They specialize in seafood and they also have live performance from Wednesday to Sunday too which is awesome to listen to while enjoying your meal! During the winterlicious, there was live performance from Tuesday to Saturday. 

LAST TIP?!

They also offer all you can eat fish at this restaurant! So take advantage of this deal if you're a fish lover for $. $9 tapas on Wednesday's too."}
{"text":"Six of us dined on Tuesday December 20th, 2016. Everybody in the group was pleased with their meal choices. Two of us had the all you can eat fish ridizio (it's what I always get here) it was consistently good and ample with great sides included. Another ordered the cod a bras and it was amazing but the all arugula salad that accompanied this dish was so so, it needed to be blended with other lettuces.  Two others ordered the steak Irene and we're pleased with its tenderness and yummy sauce. Lastly my sister ordered the veal Madeira as usual and her fav.  Overall we felt very satisfied with our experience and will definitely be back again.  The only negative was that one of the waiters didn't bring back the change for the two that paid cash. Great Portuguese food at reasonable prices. Note: They are closed Mondays & Tuesdays."}
{"text":"We arrived for an early dinner, tired and cold looking forward to a nice meal. Lisbon by Night has been open at the location on Dundas Street just west of Bathurst for an amazing 43 years. The place is located over a Portuguese bakery on the second floor. Looking south onto Dundas and east it has surprisingly beautiful views of the downtown. Because we were dining early we basically had the place to ourselves and over the course of the evening came to understand why the place has survived so long in a competitive market. Not a large place there are a selection of well dressed round and square tables looking both south and east while a well stocked bar sits on the north wall of the place. Behind that is the kitchen, with a raised stage on the west wall that features live music later in the evening. The decor and lighting is simple with candle lights on the tables and in the windows giving the place the feeling of a warm cave. Everything about the setting including the beautifully sad Portuguese laments as background music transported us to someplace other than Toronto. The experience was akin to being on vacation in some foreign land. We opted for the fish rodizo which began with a really nice fish soup. This was followed by a selection of sides including boiled potatoes, beans & rice and salsa. Next arrived a selection of fish dishes beautifully grilled with just salt, pepper and olive oil. The simplicity of the dishes let the ingredients speak for themselves. There is something so refreshing about a fish place that allows the fish to speak rather than dressing it with lots of unnecessary flavours and dressing. After finishing each selection we were presented with other fish options until we found ourselves full unable to make it through all the courses. Finally, we finished with some grilled pineapple the perfect desert for such a protein heavy meal. The service was prompt, friendly and informative letting us know what we were eating, making the whole experience really special. For anyone who loves atmosphere, good food and straight forward cooking Lisbon by Night must be experienced."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have some authentic Portuguese food. They usually offer a fish buffet on Friday, where waiters patrol the resturant with mouth watering mountins of fresh fish. Each watier carrys a differnt assortment of sea food -- salmon, octopus, Mackerel, sardines, cod fish, tuna, shrimp, etc.. I'm sure there are lots of delicious options on the menu, but I always find myself going for the infamous buffet. 

If you do get the buffet, be prepared to use your hards. And to use the sauce, which is a mix of vinegar, olive oil, onions, garlic, and parsley. Baste your fish in this delicious mixture and it will spike your taste-buds to taste-bud-heaven.  

Live music is very probable. The staff are all very nice, and encourage you to stay for as long as you like... no rush. Can also be a romantic spot.... if you're going on a date, call in advance and ask for a romantic table and you will probably get something by the window."}
