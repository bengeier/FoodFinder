{"text":"I called in a take out order on Saturday morning around 8:30. The person who answered stated that it would take 90 minutes. I said no thanks. Ordered from Bills in Cleveland Hts. Not sure if they understand the concept of a diner. Maybe they need to dine at Jims in Solon, to see how a real diner works."}
{"text":"My first visit to Lyndhurst Diner was a pleasant experience.  The food was tasty and low priced.  For a small diner (only 5 tables), the menu was quite extensive and the home cooked food was welcoming.  My friend and I each ordered an omelette and the owner personally gave us a complimentary ricotta pancake which was very good (his grandmother's recipe).  Since we went at an off hour, we got a table quickly; otherwise there might be a short wait.  For such a small place, I was amazed the owner hosts small family events plus clambakes in October.  I was glad to hear of his generously donating a portion of clambake proceeds to The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.  We had a delightful conversation with the owner, Mark, who is such a friendly and positive person.  We definitely will go back to try other selections of the delicious food and breakfast is served all day."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great neighborhood diner with a diner atmosphere you will feel right at home! Say hi to \"Bubbles\" while you're there! Good food at a great value! Love this place!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for the first time this morning and were amazed. The pancakes were exceptional - make sure to try the lemon ricotta. Their home fries are more like homemade potato chips, and are a highlight. I got a really good corned beef omelette.  Perhaps the best part is how nice everyone is, from the cook who came out to say hi to the waitress. This almost may be the cleanest diner I have ever seen.  We live in Shaker so it is a hike, but we are definitely coming back. In fact, we liked it so much that we convinced my parents to make the trip that day. They loved it as well."}
{"text":"This place has such a friendly and personal staff, not to mention the delicious food. I had the Italian grilled cheese with tater tots and my boyfriend had the ricotta pancakes. The Italian grilled cheese was perfectly seasoned and perfectly crisp on the outside. The tots were perfectly fried with crispiness that pairs well with grilled sandwiches. The ricotta pancakes were fluffy with a hint of lemon, no syrup needed! They reminded us of our favorite diner in Brooklyn. Mark (the proprietor) made me a small extra pancake to sample, and I ate it all.   Will visit again, whenever we find ourselves in Lyndhurst."}
{"text":"The server recommended since it was my 1st visit. Ricotta pancakes his grandmother's recipe from Italy! Very good!! Very moist with a hint of lemon which I love topped with powdered sugar. Syrup is provided but NOT necessary! Very filling. I needed a to go box which is unusual for me."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place many times without ever thinking of going in until a friend of mine took me for breakfast. The food took awhile to make but was well worth the wait. Great food (home fries were money) and very friendly service. The only thing I don't get is that they are not open Sundays."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little (and I do mean little) \"hole in the wall.\" Had lunch here for the first time recently at the suggestion of a friend. I am so glad I did. I had a great club sandwich and we split a basket of fries. The food was a great quality. I will say there is not a lot of room. There are six tables in the place, but it's a clean well-lighted place that feels very comfortable and somehow removed from the aggravations and pace of Mayfield Road. The prices are very reasonable. Now, I will say if there is any negative comment to be made it's that this isn't a great place to be in a hurry. It's a sit down and relax place. Although, you can phone in to-go orders. I was impressed and will be back!"}
{"text":"We visit Lyndhust Diner for breakfast as often as possible Ricotta Pancakes are nothing short of perfection. Thursday specials are always a treat. Feels like home, Mark and his mom Kathy are delightful hosts."}
{"text":"Great local food. Thursday specials you can not beat. The owner Mark,  cares and knows his customers well. Fun atmosphere where guests get to know each other or restore friendships of years past. Kathy, Mark's mother takes orders and keeps the tables moving. From liver to burgers, eggs to specials it's a friendly place to visit anytime during the day. Jon S."}
{"text":"Awesome. Food. Awesome service. Small place . Only 5 tables. Breakfast all day. Open till 6."}
{"text":"I'm not sure who the \"nice old lady\" is that people talk about.  I think her evil twin was there the day I went for breakfast.  There was no greeting when I arrived, she just slapped down the menu and walked away.  My food order was wrong, I ordered eggs over easy, they came sunny side up, no biggie.  The sausage gravy was EH, heavy on the flour (starchy).  I asked her for the check as she was standing at the counter 2 feet away from me.  She told me, \"you have to come here and get the check.\"  Whatever,  I left really unimpressed.  I know it's just a diner but in this food nation we now live in, you better step up your game, A LOT.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Need breakfast? Classic diner with surprisingly tasty diner-fare. Low prices and sweet ladies who take your orders. This is a very small space (maybe 5 or 6 tables) so don't bring your whole posse."}
{"text":"My sister and I weren't even planning on coming here for breakfast but after attempting to go to 2 other breakfast places that were closed (on a Saturday morning- just our luck) we found this place nearby. What a fantastic find! Another yelper stated it perfectly, \"if you aren't looking for it you'll pass right by it\". It's located in a mini plaza and only has five tables. These type of establishments produce some of the best food!  The menu was great. You can get lunch and breakfast all day so that is exactly what I did. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and the poutine. Who needs hash browns when you can order poutine for breakfast! It was even a hit with my niece and nephew (who are 5 and 2)!  There are so many items I want to come back and try. The drive from the West Side is well worth it to come here!"}
{"text":"So to be fair, I compare all diners to NJ diners. The most and best in the country according to not just myself.  Sorry, I just can't help myself! Waiting until I was sick from hunger I needed a good, comfort-food breakfast place. Using trusty Yelp I found this place.   Although I'm always skeptical of diners outside of Jersey and any in strip malls, I soon found myself liking this place.  The immediate greeting and customer acknowledgement from the cook, owner, buyer (a salesman was eating and taking some type of food provision order from him I believe) and ambassador (to be explained in my review) made me feel welcome.  Within minutes, he has a menu in my hand and coffee in my cup. I quickly ordered John's Corned Beef Scramble. Although I did not ask, I presume he was John. Well, John is a one man army who has mastered the battle and strategy.  I commented on our different pronunciations of coffee (his cahfee, my cawfee) and he now knew I'm from Joisey.   His scramble was excellent and hit the spot. The chips that came with it came with an explanation that it's a local staple he does (I suppose instead of homefries) and they were perfectly crisp and the right thickness. Finally, ambassador John brought out a complimentary Ricotta Pancake that he had on his Specials board so I can try another staple he's perfecting.  It too was excellent.  It turns out John is actually Mark but if he's not the owner he acts like one. And the owner should be thankful for that! My only suggestion for this diner would to have a themed ambience. It's too vanilla and scattershot. Maybe wall murals or pictures of famed diners? Best of luck here and I would recommend to anyone to stop in."}
{"text":"My first time here and seriously I don't know what took me so long. Great burgers. I got the Kathy. Delish. Tater tots were great and huge portion. My mom got the same burger and onion rings. I'm not a fan of them normally. They're usually just too greasy and you pull the onions out. Not these. Perfect. I'd totally get a basket of them. I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Friendly and well priced tiny little diner. There are only 5 tables here so timing is everything.  At our table we got the lemon ricotta pancakes, chicken and waffles, breakfast sandwich, and poutine. Good, good, good, and good."}
{"text":"Had the barbecue chicken and tater tot pizza, delicious!  Love the diner feel of this place and can't believe how many times I drove past this place without even noticing it.  Thank you yelp!  My only itsy bitsy gripe which would be big at any other restaurant is that after the waitress took our order she never came back. Hey can I get a refill please!"}
{"text":"There was a fly in my husbands orange juice and a hair in his food.  We were 2 of 4 people in the diner and it took 25 min to get our food... probably wont be going back."}
{"text":"Spectacular food, great owner! Some of the freshest food you can get in the area. We've been probably 5 or 6 times now, had most of the breakfast staples, and they were ALL awesome. For example, veggies in the omelettes have a refreshing crunch to them, as do the homemade house chips. Pancakes are light, fluffy, and flavorful; not dense or squishy. The flavors are quite rich, but the food not over-heavy. The owner (who also does most of the cooking, I think) is a really talented chef. You owe it to yourself to come and experience this fine example of how to master the classics.  If it burns you up that more and more of the places you go these days spend on decor and skimp on the chef, you should come here because you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I love a great breakfast place and had been hearing about this place for awhile. After a beautiful Ohio November I woke up to the first snowy morning of the season ... and being a Sunday morning what better to do than try out a new breakfast place.  Rushed the wife and son to get out of the house since the description of great and small usually means that if you don't get there early you will have a significant wait on a Sunday morning. The Lyndhurst Diner opened at 8am, but my anxiety of a wait during the short drive was subdued when I saw that only one of the five tables was occupied ... must be because of the snowy weather.  OK, so why did I give it 3 stars and not 5?  First off, despite only one other table it took over 30 minutes to get our food ... so I heard several times from my son, \"I'm hungry, where's the food.\"  I ordered the fried bologna scramble, my wife ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and the son went for eggs benedict.  The fried bologna scramble was tasty but the accompanying hash browns were mediocre ... asked if I could have an english muffin was told, \"I don't think we allow substitutions\" ... I would have paid extra but did not offer.  My son said the eggs benedict was good but it didn't fill him up, surprizingly it did not come with hash browns which I would have gladly paid extra for if I was informed they were not included.  The wife thought the lemon ricotta pancakes were either doughy or not fully cooked .. OK, she's picky so my son and I ate half of them.  My fondness for local restaurants will have me give the Lyndhurst Diner a second try ... maybe I caught them on a bad day.  Will let you know what I think after the next visit ... feel bad about giving a local place a mediocre review."}
{"text":"I came to this awesome hole in wall joint and tried out their breakfast tacos. I was very very happy with the food, although a little skeptical at first. The guys who work there really make you feel at home. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very good food! Fast and friendly service too! We had breakfast there this morning. I had the special Italian scrambled eggs which are delicious and my son had pancakes which were huge! They we're delicious too! Can't wait to go for lunch and dinner. I hear they have great specials on Thursdays."}
{"text":"This place is smaller than I expected but everyone that works there is wonderful! The owner is a cool guy and cooks up some great food.   My family stopped in for a late breakfast and ordered a variety of food including pancakes, chicken and waffles, tater tots. The food was hot, fresh and very good. As if we didn't have enough food, the owner sent over some ricotta pancakes that are to die for. My daughter who hates ricotta loved them as well. We wound up eating those and taking our original pancakes to go. I'll definitely order those next time.   Our wait was only about 10 minutes to get seated and the food came out pretty quickly considering that the place was full."}
{"text":"I don't really have anything good or bad to say about this place I guess. I like to eat vegetarian as much as possible and in the event that I can't I go with seafood. I kinda feel like every place should offer some sort of vegetarian option in 2015.  Needless to say I had no time to drive and find a new spot on my hour lunch break so I order the fish sandwich and it was pretty pathetic.  I feel like they fried up some fish sticks and charged me $7 for them."}
{"text":"Best little diner in SE Cleveland. It's really small and hard to find as it is nestled in a small strip mall, but a true diner experience. Friendly staff. The breakfast has been consistently really good both times I have come with my family. I love the salami scramble but my son swears the Joe's Massive breakfast tastes great and is a must."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best diner I have ever visited.  I am from out of town and decided a little town diner would be a fun experience.  Definitely recommend... The owners are sweet and will definitely take the 5 hour trip just for this food."}
{"text":"Great little place. The breakfast we had hit the spot. I had the cornbeef scramble and it was soooo good.  We are moving to the area and wanted to find a little spot to get a bite.  We will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"My parents are regulars there and they take us whenever my wife and I are in town.  Very good food and an owner/cook who cares about what he is doing."}
{"text":"I was passing through, charging my car, and saw that Yelp loves this place, so I stopped in. The waitress said the burgers are a big hit so I decided to try a jalapeño burger with tots. The burger was phenomenal. The tots were good and made fresh for me. The chef, who may be the owner, was beyond exceptional - very polite and great at his job. The waitress was tremendously nice to the locals and polite, but not as exuberantly friendly, with me. I very much enjoyed this little hole-in-the-wall diner."}
{"text":"Great family place. Friendly clean and well priced. I'll be coming back many times. If you want a nice quick breakfast or lunch - forget the chains and support something local. My 4 year old ate his entire lunch (and it was a big). That is a rare occurrence."}
{"text":"My mom loves this place and was excited for us to have breakfast here but now she says she is never coming back. It took over 30 minutes to order and that is just because we walked up to the counter and asked. We both ordered pancakes and sausage and it took another 30-45 minutes to get our food and then it was almost inedible because it was so over cooked. My mom couldn't cut her pancake (yes, PANCAKE! (Which also tasted sour)) and  the sausage was close to resembling some kind of jerky. We may have just come at an unusually busy time but one of the cooks was helping serve and couldn't have seemed more put out when we asked for syrup. The lady at the front counter was nice, when we finally got to talk to her, but with only 4 tables I don't know how everything took so long... Definitely disappointed."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat. The tater tats are fantastic and the Kathy burger is perfect! Small but friendly atmosphere. A must visit!"}
{"text":"Last Saturday we tried to go to our old standby diner, Jack's Deli but found it closed due to Yom Kippur.  So I typed \"diner\" into google maps and was led to the Lyndhurst diner.  Not only is it tiny and obviously family run (which let's be honest, usually means the best diners) the food was great, the service considering the skeleton crew they work with was wonderful and I can't wait to go back.  What a great little known secret for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"full disclosure .. the 4 stars are for the friendly service + the fact that this place is SPOTLESSLY clean .. the food, I can make better at home quite honestly .. edible for sure but nothing I would go out of my way for again .. too bad .. diners are a favorite of mine but not when the food does not stand out over the cleanliness"}
{"text":"This place is the best little find EVER! Small place with only 5 tables and a carryout option, open daily til 5pm. Service was nice and friendly and quick. The cook told us about their Ricotta Pancakes and his special sauce, and then brought out a sample of each with an order of fries. Their breakfast was good and I will definitely be going back to try the burger and loaded home fries (made like potato chips). Great service, good food, cheap. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is a very special place. The food is so so good, and the owner/chef is the nicest person.  Everything I've had here is delicious, especially the ricotta pancakes."}
{"text":"Sooooooo slow. The older lady waiting tables and running the cash register seemed very nice but she was so slow we left after waiting ten minutes for our drinks that never came. Another customer changed his order to go after waiting a long time. The other tables didn't get any food delivered to their tables during the twenty minutes we were there. I doubt the lady even noticed we left. Won't be back."}
{"text":"First time in and im mad that this little gem wasnt found sooner!! Just a small place with 5 tables and a small diner feel. I ordered the Meat Omlette with hash browns and a side of grits!! The portion was huge!! Very tasty and the cook brought the food to the table his self. The coffe was good and they kept my cup full.  I will be going here again, seems to be quite the variety on the menu.  Would give it 5 stars, but it was freezing inside today!!"}
{"text":"I never get anything complicated, just grilled cheese or blt, but it's always delicious. Always. The owner is super friendly. I'm our experiences, there has never been what seemed like a server, rather just a friend helping serve the food. This resulted in not as attentive service as I would have hoped. Otherwise, I love everything about the food."}
