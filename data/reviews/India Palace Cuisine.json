{"text":"Worst food ever , it seems like these people stores the food and deliver the next days by just heating .we went with our family and every one had food poisoning . I will request every one not to have food in order to safeguard our self and avoid doctor's visit."}
{"text":"I work downtown and eat lunch there at least once a week. The food is delicious and feels really home made.  The selection is not huge but decent. I prefer less options but a better quality, good tasting food.  Usually i am not a fan of buffets, but in this case - its better than most of Indian a la carte restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"Decent.  I do not give them a full recommendation. Saag, naan and Chana Masala left more to be expected."}
{"text":"Had lunch yesterday. Bland and lukewarm. Watery rice. If you want plain vanilla Indian food, this is it."}
{"text":"Love the food at this informal downtown place. The menu is interesting and everything is extremely well prepared. Try the palak paneer with a side of raita or the mango lamb curry. All delicious. And the naan is excellent too. It's high on our list of Best Indian restaurants anywhere and we are lucky to have such a great place right here at home. Pro tip: if you're going to a game come early and eat here. There's never a wait."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have mixed feelings.  The service is very good and I would love to say that the food is great-- it's just OK.  I've had the dinner buffet and have ordered dinner off the menu.  The food from the buffet is not that great-- kind of bland.  And even the naan on the buffet is cold and dry.  Ordered from the menu, dinner was much better.  The atmosphere is cold though-- literally in the winter when the doors open.  It is seriously cold in there.  It's a big space so I guess the heating bill gets pretty high.  Wait until the weather heats up and skip the buffet so you can order a higher spice level.   If you're looking for Indian food downtown this is probably the best option, but if you can get to Oakland, there are several better options."}
{"text":"Nice-looking place on the inside with beautiful art/artifacts. Quite clean! Order the samosa chaat, paneer tikka tandoor, bhangan bharta, naan, and lassi! Some of the tastiest Indian food I've had."}
{"text":"the **B.E.S.T* * most **FANTASTIC** aloo gobi i've ever had in my life !  my boyfriend & i go here whenever we can to get that dish (we dine at expensive & high end restaurants a lot & this dish rivals anything we've had in the pittsburgh area).  every indian or pakastani restaurant has their own style of this dish.  we've tried aloo gobi at at about 5 indian (& 1 pakastani) restaurants & india palace is the only place that creates a master piece of perfection !  the other places just smother the dish in gravy/sauce so there's no technique or care needed, but at India Palace, they make their aloo gobi moist & with the perfect delicate blend of spices & herbs (but not swimming in a pile of gravy like other places do).  the chef makes it with finely chopped sauteed onions & i've talked to him about this dish & he confirms that it takes more time.  even though i used to be a big meat-eater, this dish (no meat) has such an outrageously awesome blend of spices that it's as savory as any dish.  i've had other dishes at india palace & aloo gobi is the best - it's OUT OF THIS WORLD & i can't recommend this dish enough !!!!!!!!  their naan is good too (compared to other indian restaurant) but the aloo gobi is a *must have* !"}
{"text":"I like this place. I always stop in when visiting Pittsburgh and it never disappoints. I have never had the lunch buffet but dinner is always solid and reasonable.  If you are new to Indian get Samosas, Makhani Chicken, Naan and Raita sauce. Damn...."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner. It wasn't a bad place...also wasn't that great either. I've had better Indian food. Service was decent and the people were nice."}
{"text":"Ate there for the 1st time today.  I ordered off the menu (not the buffet) to go.  Alu Gobi was delicious!  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Well, it was a surprise!  Some reviews said that the food quality was very poor and such, quite a contrast actually.   The food was good (chicken tikka, chicken curry, aloo tikki, aloo gobhi, chhole, dal makhani).  The dessert section had kheer (rice pudding) and gulab jamun.  The chicken curry was good and the naan was soft.  The aloo tikki was nothing special and I did not try the vegetarian items as I was full.   For $9.62 including tax this was a good place.  They even had lassis and fountain drinks but I didn't try it.  They do take credit cards too so that helps travelers like me.  I'd have given it a 3.5 stars rather than a 4 but 4 it is!"}
{"text":"Can i give negative 5 as a rating. This is the worst place. We are visiting Pittsburgh and wanted some indian food. Ended up stopping here to grab a bite. The table was filthy and I got a layer of dirt when wiped. The food miserable, both my wife and I had food poisoning immediately. They said everything is cooked to order and made fresh. I really doubt that. The entire night was a battle if you know what I mean. Please do not serve stale food and don't lie.  We do not recommend this place, please find alternatives."}
{"text":"a good lunch chow-spot at the northern end of downtown pgh. lots of office workers. $8.99. nothing too fancy or exotic as in higher-end indian restaurants in town(the mintt, all india, tamarind)but you wont leave, hungry. right across the street from the trendy spendy deshantz places like pork n beans & butcher and rye. i have to wonder how much business india palace steals from those places, for dinner."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  I haven't been to the buffet, but have been here many times for dinner, usually before a show in the cultural district.  One of the best Indian restaurants I've been to.  The tandoori chicken tikka is excellent and so are all of the naan choices!  Prices are extremely reasonable and service is fast."}
{"text":"The buffet had a variety of food from rice to naan, chicken tikka. The tandoori chicken was my favorite! The food was very fresh and was restocked often so you would never have to wait for your favorite things.  The rice ball dessert was okay - I have had better. I did not try their salad bar.  The service was good - and the staff there was very friendly. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I had recently gone to the Indian buffet at Indian Spices, two doors down, so I wanted to compare.  I would say that in a dead heat, Indian Spices would take the win.  They are the same price, India Palace definitely has a nicer decor - it's larger and more spacious, but the food has a bit more spice at Indian Spices.   India Palace has a 8.99 lunch buffet.  Standard fare with dessert, but all the food was lacking a bit in heat which was disappointing.  Also, there weren't enough vegetables.  I feel like everything was chicken which was not what everyone is looking for.    The hostess was quick with silverware and waters though.  It looks like you could also get tea and some other drinks as well."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in the Cultural District! We brought a bottle of wine from the Market Square Grocery. This restaurant is BYOB with no corkage fee! We ordered the Malai Kofta and the Palak Paneer. The Kofta in particular was a deliciously balanced blend of spice, cheese, and veggies.  Subtract one star for: The a/c is fairly weak, and there were a few little flies. Both of which perhaps are part of the authentic Indian atmosphere :-P  After walking past the crowded, noisy venues of Market Square and Sixth Street it was nice to find an affordable, tasty venue for a quiet dinner date after enjoying comedy at Arcade. Methinks this place could stand to be a little bit LESS quiet though. Check it out next time you are downtown!"}
{"text":"This is a go-to spot for some of my co-workers and me when we just want to get STUPID full on naan and curry.  It's not a high-end Indian restaurant, however, it's inexpensive, fast, the food is tasty, and the staff is efficient and friendly.  Every time I come here, it's packed by 12:30 and there's a mad run on naan.  Get at it."}
{"text":"The food is good. The staff is cold and unfriendly. I have been here twice and both times I was made to feel a bother. Didn't want to answer questions. Food is good. The restaurant is messy with boxes, miscellaneous stuff like two dried dead plants in the front window ....Food is really good so I will go back again. I will bring others to just don't expect \"Palace\" treatment."}
{"text":"Went here for the buffet lunch with a co-worker. The people that worked there were very pleasant and the service was fast. We were seated right away and told we could go right up to get our food. The food was good but nothing special. They had some spicy options but not all that spicy (I guess you can't expect much from a buffet in that area). They had a good selection of both vegetarian and meat options so there was something for everyone. Would I go back, if I worked Downtown all the time, probably yes but I would not make it a point to go there otherwise."}
{"text":"The sign outside of the restaurant says fine Indian cuisine. But there's nothing  that reads 'fine' in this restaurant. The interior is very dated with dark carpeted floors. The bench style seating also has formica table tops. I received my silverware wrapped in a white paper napkin. And I received my water in an amber colored plastic cup, the likes of what you'd see in a cafeteria. You get the drift, it's not a fine dining kind of place.  I was on the fence about trying it, but decided to give it a go. Surprisingly, the food was good. Not stellar, but definitely tasty. The portion sizes were also more than average. The staff was pleasant. They gave me a to-go cup for my mango lassi. I'd try it again if I have another craving for Indian food when I'm downtown."}
{"text":"The food is great but they often refuse to deliver to downtown addresses during lunchtime, so its hard to get their food on a lunch break."}
{"text":"This place is great.  the people here are very friendly, and the new location is roomy, well lit and clean.  The simple fact that it is packed every day is a testament to the quality.    There is always an excellent buffet for lunch with a wide array of both vegetarian and non-veg entrees (typically chicken for the non-veg).  Also their condiment area featuring a number of chutneys, relishes and sauces is extensive.  They typically feature two desserts in the buffet as well.    They will also provide the means, e.g., raw green super hot chili's, to spice up your meal on request.    This is my preferred Indian downtown without question."}
{"text":"Decent, cheap Indian buffet downtown.  The food is pretty good. Nothing special, about what you'd expect from an Indian buffet. Naan, tandoori chicken, pallak paneer, chicken tikka masala, rice pudding, etc.  Friendly staff, clean establishment and the standard ambiance you'd expect from an Indian restaurant downtown. Overall a solid lunch choice."}
{"text":"Probably the best last decision I made for 2012. It is very close to the Renaissance Hotel where I stayed. The buffet is about $12.00 for dinner and is excellent. It met all my expectations for buffet Indian food. It had all the 'staples' for the buffet; chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, rice, chicken tikka, naan, chick peas, and rice pudding that was rather watery. The food wasn't very spicy but more on the mild side. The interior is what hurt this place, its rather bland and the furniture isn't very comfortable. The tables are small and the seats are smaller. The decorations are mixed up and there appears to be no theme other than 'lets put some Indian relics and a flag up'. The service is quick and the staff is rather aloof.   Given the right circumstances and a matter of convenience I will stop here again."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh in June for Anthrocon. This restaurant is six blocks from the hotel but our dinner group decided to do the walk one night just to have something different one night. The restaurant wasn't very busy that night and they have plenty of seating in the dining area. Service was good and the server took the time to explain some of the menu items. I ordered some vegetable pakoras and the lamb curry. For the lamb curry, she asked me to specify a degree of spiciness from 1 to 10. I chose 9 but when I tasted the curry, it wasn't that hot. I'd have rated it a 5 or 6 at most. However, I have eaten a lot of spicy food, so I may be biased here.  Anyway, it was overall a pleasant experience. I'd definitely revisit again and next time, I'll ask for a 10."}
{"text":"Absolutely first class food. I had lamb rogan josh and onion nan. I think this is the best I've ever eaten. As I walked through the door I nearly turned around as decor isn't great but then I noticed every single person was Indian. Good sign and they were spot on."}
{"text":"India Palace was a classic Indian buffet restaurant. They offer the traditional dishes and the environment is very standard if you've had Indian food before. The lunch buffet price is $8.99 plus tax, which is very reasonable. The service is minimal, but not terrible. I enjoyed their food and all the tastes were standardized. If you want a quick bite that will meet your expectations, no more and no less, then give this place a try. Blessings!"}
{"text":"my favorite india food in pittsburgh.  everything was fresh (dinner) and nice, clean space.  you can tell the staff take pride in their establishment."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple of times now and it is consistently below average. The water cups seem to have an affinity for soap residue as well. Go two doors down to Indian Spices."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant near our hotel... It's walkable from Wyndham hotel where we stayed... At first sight it was uninviting.. There was a couple sitting... We went in... Interior was kind of fine... The staff is very cordial n they customize the spice level according to the requirement. We liked it... We placed an order for kadai panner And daal  makhani they were bad...  Onion naan , parantha and tandoori roti were soft and chewy... Had that charring and crispy texture too..."}
{"text":"This place continues to be my favorite Northern Indian lunch destination in the heart of this great City. The atmosphere is awesome from the decor to the welcoming hosts and the authentic food. The tandoori naan is great and is made in a real clay oven and has the great taste. The curries, appetizers and desserts in the lunch buffet are all so good. You cannot beat the atmosphere, price and location. You have to try this very well run established Indian restaurant which was the first one to open in downtown all those years ago."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a reasonably priced lunch buffet in downtown Pittsburgh - this fits the bill.  $8.95 per person.  Food was decent and not too spicy.  Not as many choices as other buffets but enough to eat for lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite at lunchtime. The buffet has a variety of delicious food. My favorites were the aloo gobi and the samosas. The staff are friendly and the restaurant is clean. A very enjoyable experience. BTW, by noon this place was filled to capacity! And on the way out of the restaurant, there was a guy from the restaurant playing on a drum to \"drum-up\" business!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for something different today so I decided to give the India Palace a try.  I can't believe I've been passing this place by for so long.   I got a seat at a booth then went straight to the buffet. What an array of choices available. I decided to try a little of everything. Although the tandoori chicken was a tad bit dry (and I'm nit-picking here), I can honestly say that there was nothing that I didn't like.  It was a festival of flavors.   In addition to the deliciousness of the food, the place is spacious, comfortable and clean and the people are courteous and friendly. I've got nothing bad to say about this place.   If you're downtown and getting tired of the burgers, pizza, sandwiches and such, give the India Palace a try.  If you like flavors, you'll luv this place."}
{"text":"Came here in the evening prior to a symphony performance - it's just down the street from Heinz Hall. It was...okay. Buffet for me, and the food was passable, although it had obviously been out for a while. My young son ordered off the menu, and his food was okay, in his regard. The restaurant seemed clean enough, although for some reason two pairs of tennis shoes were on the floor at the end of our aisle - wonder who owned those? Good enough...my son wanted to try Indian cuisine, and so now he has. Might stop in again, might not."}
{"text":"Meh. It was ok. I do not know what else to say about the food or even the decor. Meh kinda is the feeling I had after eating here today. I went with a fellow Yelp friend who works down town. It was the lunch buffet so I did not know what I was in store for, but for the price of $8.99 I thought, why not. The place is really big inside. There is enough seating in there for large groups of people and even an area that looks like it could be sectioned off for a party that would be separate from the rest of the restaurant.   The service was ok. Nothing out of the ordinary happened. They sat us, they were friendly, but they weren't really checking often to see if we needed anything. I could have just went up to get another drink but decided against it and just had one. They did clear the tables rather quickly but checking to see if we needed anything else wasn't something that happened. So meh...  The food was also meh. Nothing out of this world spectacular but nothing that was terrible. The chicken was good and so was the veggie options. I will say that the tikka masala chicken was a little dry, which is hard to do, I think, for something that is marinated in a heavy sauce. But the sauce was also a bit watered down. So meh...  I won't say that I will come here again, but then again I do not head downtown very often. It was not terrible but it wasn't stellar. So meh. Try it out, and maybe dinner is better than the buffet!"}
{"text":"Stopped in right after they opened.  Some of the booths are oddly *tiny*.  Find another one if it doesn't work out, don't sit where you're uncomfortable.  They might have fixed this, dunno.  I feel bad that they moved next door to another indian place... because India Palace is the better of the two for lunch.  The buffet is still about $10, but the buffet here seems to have about twice the variety, and it's all pretty good.    For Indian for lunch Downtown, I'm still a fan of Sree's, but for all-you-can-eat, this is the place."}
{"text":"Very good! You can tell that the dishes have been toned down for the American palette. I chose the buffet, which was excellent. The chicken makhani was watered down... But it was OK. The rest of the foods were fresh and were re-stocked often. The place gets packed around 12pm, so get there before or after the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Walked part this place and the sign read 8.99 lunch buffet and I saw businessmen keep pooling in. I decided to check it out and I'm glad I did. First off its a old Indian restraunt. I did not expect anything less.the service was very fast and friendly. I loved everything on the buffet and their nann was Warm and chewy. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Restaurant was very clean and welcoming. It is low key and quiet, with friendly and helpful servers, choice of tables or booths. Service was fast and efficient and food was served at the ideal temperature, hot or cold. Food is prepared when ordered. For me, I appreciated the extensive vegetarian options. All members of my party agreed that their meals were excellent. I would highly recommend this restaurant, even if you're not that familiar with Indian cuisine. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Indian flavored Sugar and Fast and Loose with the Credit Card.  I went last year, so its been awhile so maybe they decided to use traditional recipes and not pad your credit card charge. I went for their lunch buffet. Every dish, except one or two, was sickenly sweet. It was like no other Indian restuarant I've ever been to. It was as if they had heard that Americans like sweet food, so they piled in the sugar. The daughter of the owner waited on me and she was very sweet (you could tell that it was a family owned business). I left her a $3.00 cash tip for my $7.99 lunch which I charged on my credit card. However when I got home and checked my credit account they had assessed an additional 15% on my card without telling me. I haven't been back, obviously, and I don't intend on returning anytime soon. Watch your wallet if you go. Their love of money goes way past their love of making good, traditional food."}
{"text":"When I am starving for Indian food, this is the place I go to. Good assortment of choices and it changes some day to day. The quality has had more good days then ok days. I have never left there unhappy during lunch. Always a fan of their chili chicken and bread."}
