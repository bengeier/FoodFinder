{"text":"Good service but food is just average. I had brunch here and ordered eggs benedicte.  The atmosphere is not that nice in this place but again, the servers are very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Healthy and illy!!

I have passed Zoe's twice a day on average for the past year and never eaten there. Needless to say their coffee is delicious. It's illy coffee which is nothing less than satisfying for the average coffee lover....Even the Starbucks right across the street doesn't make me stray.

Zoe's looks tiny from the outside, but it's very spacious inside. It's more like a restaurant/cafe than it is a bakery. Although they have a great bakery section with delicious eye candy that is hard to resist, as well as an extensive menu with sandwich's, soups, salads, wraps, etc.

I ordered a sandwich - I got the Spicy Piri Piri Chicken. The sandwich was huge, with a side of salad, and extremely filling for me. It was super healthy and I enjoyed it! The chicken was really fresh, it had avocado, and a zesty onion jam sauce - yummy! My girlfriend got the Tango Chicken Wrap which was similar to my sandwich, we found, but had an interesting mix of fruits in it like apple and pineapple, and avocado, carrots, almonds, in a delicious aioli sauce..... I basically want one now.

It's the perfect spot for a quick casual meal or an easy win for a long-drawn, work-filled date with your laptop. It's not the cheapest place for sandwiches and salads, but I found it was worth it because of the portion of the sandwich. (I actually paid extra money for the side salad and it was quite tiny - slightly disappointing.)

The service is quick and friendly, and the ambiance is very relaxed. Basically, if you're in the neighbourhood, GO TO ZOE'S!!!!!"}
{"text":"It is expensive...and sometimes the wait is long...but the food...oh!  
The food is excellent!  

I have had the chicken & chickpea wrap, the frittata, the california salad, the pad thai special, a pasta dish...and I have seen my friends and colleagues try numerous other delectable dishes too...all freshly made, well presented and delicious!

No-one's ever complained and if there is a slight eyebrow raised at the prices when scanning the menu, it is quickly replaced with a delighted smile at the size of the portion and the taste of the meal.

Working near Zoe's forced me to go there as it is the company hangout however, I am happy to say that now it is extremely rare that I am dragged there kicking and screaming!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  
Terrible waiting time.  
Terrible set up.
Terrible people.

Been a long time,  but I remember your non-chalante service and \"I'm an artist, therefore people don't understand me vibe. \" Maybe you will come to understand that 30 minutes for some mediocre sandwiches,  literally thrown on the table by a non eye contacting, disagreeable hefer,  that acts like she can't hear me,  doesn't add value in your business.  

Note: I'm not insinuating that anyone is fat nor have I acquired a distaste for fat people, I'm just referencing cows for their docile,  listless ways."}
{"text":"I've been to Zoe's tons of times, and it's easily one of my favourites in the area.
I'm normally there for lunch, but, managed to make it there a bit earlier today, and tried one of their breakie sandwiches.
The sandwich looked AND tasted great. It didn't resemble an origami creation like some food that has been folded and wrapped to go! The breakie sandwich came with egg, cheese, tomato and Bacon (**Personally, it HAS to have bacon or sausage to be considered a \"true\" breakie sandwich! Oh, who am i kidding, bacon tastes great on anything! lol**)
If you're not into sandwiches, they have soups, salads, desserts, and other items to choose from!
Zoe's offers tons of indoor seating (with waitress service), and a decent patio if you want to chill outside with friends (although there is a Condo being built next door now, so it's a bit noisy!).
You should check out Zoe's if you're ever in the area as it's an incredible place!



Tips- 
1) Try Zoe's club, excellent sandwich and fairly large too (enough for two to share!).
2) The Breakfast sandwich was tasty, but, I thought it was a bit expensive ($11.50 for a sandwich & dbl Americano!!). 
3) Besides the price, the only \"negative\" thing I can say is that their sandwich board is BRUTAL! All of the meals are squished together, and tough to read!"}
{"text":"Meh.  My coworkers love this place, so I end up here frequently, but the veggie sandwiches are bland and overpriced and I don't like the muffins.  (Fair warning: everyone I work with disagrees with me, so it might just be me.)"}
{"text":"This is a tough review - because the food at Zoe's is always good.  It is the service that is consistently atrocious.  If you are lucky you are simply ignored and wait too long for everything, ranging to out right rude over the top \"too cool for this job\" attitude

{"text":"Zoe's holds a special place in my heart, for it is the reward for all dentist visits (I know, I know). My dentist is just down the road, so usually I'll walk by and lament the fact that I can't go and buy a cupcake or a cup of tea or a cookie because I need to keep everything clean and shiny, shiny. HOWEVER, nothing says I can't get something on the way home, right?

Most of the time when I'm in here, I have fat lip, fat chin, fat tongue, or all of the above. Sometimes I'm really grumpy and feeling sorry for myself, sometimes I'm really happy to finally have something taken care of. Whatever my mood, the staff is always lovely and cheerful and willing to chat with me (though I have a feeling they never understand me!).

Today was the first time I tried their cookies and, let me tell you, WOW. I had the ginger/molasses and the chocolate chip. They're big, chewy and cheap. The trifecta! Under $4 for the two. I should have bought more. They also had a really interesting one -- sort of like a cookie with everything on it. It had chocolate chips, peanuts, marshmallows, coconut, peanuts ... everything! If I weren't against peanuts+chocolate on principal, I would have been all over that like an incurable STD.

While I can't vouch for the cookies day-old taste, I do know the cupcakes aren't as good when left for a day or so in the fridge. Definitely best eaten fresh. Luckily, around the same time I figured this out, I also realised that while you generally lose your appetite after the dentist because of the soreness and the feelings of violation, you can pretty much do whatever you want until the freezing wears off as long as you're careful not to chomp on yourself. Therefore, my advice on Zoe's is to purchase and eat IMMEDIATELY. Nothing sexier than slobbering like a toddler all over a cookie on the streetcar. Heck yes!"}
{"text":"This place was dead at 12pm - I spent over 6$ on a quiche, the crust was old and almost stale, definitely not fresh.  I inquired about the salad and it was overpriced so I decided not to have the salad.  On the plus side, I did get $5 off my order for paying with paypal.  The quiche itself was bland, I could definitely make a better one at home."}
{"text":"Zoe's is a bakery located on King and Brant, serving up gourmet sandwiches, salads and fresh pastries. They are now open in the evening for cocktails, with a brand new, gorgeous bar built in next to the bakery counter. I work nearby and often stop in for lunch.

I have too many favourite dishes, so I'll start by recommending the spicy tofu salad. The veggies are always fresh and crisp, and the tofu packs just the right amount of heat. The serving is huge, so you'll end up with some enjoyable leftovers. I also go in the AM for their warm, comforting pastries.

Unfortunately, I can't give the place more stars than I'd like because the service just isn't up to snuff. This morning I ordered a bagel and watched as the staff stood around and chatted while my bagel sat cooling on the outside of the toaster. I had to remind them I was waiting, and one of the servers ambled over to the toaster and took her sweet time preparing the bagel. She then handed it to me without a word.

That being said, there are a handful of staff members that are quite cheery and polite. So whether or not you actually make it back to work within your lunch hour depends on who is working during your stay. The food is phenomenal, so if you don't mind indifferent wait staff, I recommend a visit. Grab a patio seat while the weather's still lovely and give yourself some extra time."}
{"text":"Table service is a little slow, but take-out for lunch is speedy. Love the club sandwich."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would.

We arrived just after 10:30am hoping for breakfast. After standing there for 10 minutes someone finally came to seat us. We asked if we could still order breakfast (which ends at 10:30am).  They were nice enough to let us.  That's where the positive ends.

My fiance ordered scrambled eggs and ham... not 5 minutes into his meal, he noticed these little flies (bigger than fruit flies but an orange/brown colour) drop into his food.  About 5 of them dropped into his eggs.  He is not the type to cause a scene or complain, but seriously this was flies DROPPING INTO HIS HARDLY TOUCHED MEAL.  He picked them out, and moved over to the seat next to him. I called the server over and pointed out to her the flies in his eggs and napkins which were now on the table.  She made a half hearted apology and \"would be sure to inform someone\". WTF does that even mean?

She came to take his plate away when we were \"done\"- not even acknowledging that he hardly ate anything..nor did I since I was so disturbed.  She did not comp anything on the bill or offer to bring him a fresh dish w/ no flies in it.

Talk about brutal service.  How would any normal human being not think to immediately offer to take his plate away after I pointed out that flies were dropping from the ceiling/light fixture - whereever they came from!

I left her a big fat NOTHING for a tip and explained to her at that point that there were FLIES in his food and she did not do anything about it.  Only then did she give a (probably fake) but lengthy apology and she seemed so spaced out as if this was the first time she'd heard about these flies in the eggs.  You have to be an idiot to think it's okay to let a customer continue to eat their meal after flies fell into it, and not one fly but several!

Potential customers: pay attention to these other bad reviews and stay far away from this disgusting establishment with equally disgraceful staff."}
{"text":"I just had the chipotle beef salad for lunch and it was amazing.  High quality ingredients, satisfying portion and terrific service.  I will definitely be coming back to try something else on the very extensive menu.  Everything looks delicious and there's something to choose for everyone."}
{"text":"It was cold out, I saw Illy and it was a magnet for something to keep me warm.  I dropped in for a coffee to go and realized that this place is massive!  It's less a cafe and more of a restaurant with a coffee shop attached to it.

I ordered a coffee and the staff were quick to rush us out as they were closing in a minute.  I won't hold that against them but seriously, I was only ordering a coffee to go!

The coffee was delicious and helped with the cold walk home.  I'll be back to check out other things as they look to have a lot of goodies."}
{"text":"The vegan sandwiches, salads and stir fry are bland and over-priced. The pre-made beet salad is decent. The pre-made bean salad is tasty and a fair price.

Besides the food not being the greatest, I've had a few off experiences with some of the staff (not all - most are friendly when it's not super busy).  The last time I went there one of girls behind the counter was very stand-offish. She was aggressively throwing cutlery around and making a ruckus right in front of me. I could have got better service at mcdonalds ordering from a high school student at 2am. 

I also ordered a stir fry one time and asked for more veggies instead of rice. When I got the bill I saw they charged me more for the veggies. If she had just told me right off that bat is was extra I wouldn't have cared but the fact that she didn't tell me they shouldn't have charged me for it. I ended up paying $20 for a bland stir fry. I could have got a way healthier one for $12 from Fresh. 

If it wasn't for these 2 bad experiences I would probably go back but there's too many other places with friendly staff, better prices, and tastier vegetarian food."}

{"text":"I came in and was greeted by an extremely friendly employee. Ordered the salmon avocado wrap and I LOVED IT. They definitely didn't skimp on the salmon and it was delicious. Thinking about it is making me crave it.
My friend got the french toast, and I think it was a tad expensive but still good."}
{"text":"ZOë's Fish Tacos was a great lunch. \"Cajun herb cornmeal crusted White fish & BBQ Shrimps.
Garnished with citrus apple slaw, avocado, baby kale, fresh herbs, grilled onion rings, julienne peppers & Thai sweet chili sauce. Topped with pea sprout sprigs.\"
I went there for lunch with a friend. My plate came with 3 good size soft tacos packed with fish and other goodies. all the falvours meld together smoothly. the amount of sauce was just right for me. it was not too saucy and not dripping. the stuffing was packed though and it took good eating skills to keep everything in the taco. the place is friendly and certainly has a Toronto character to it (this come from me coming from the village \"Unionville\"). I would have been good with two tacos and over enjoyed the 3rd. I think two tacos to share with three standard size 30+ year olds would be enough. maybe I should say 50+!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Only been there once but it was enough to make me write this review.

$15 for a totally pedestrian and actually pretty small \"large chicken caeser salad\". I will definitely not be returning to this place.

Might be harsh, as I haven't tried anything else from here."}
{"text":"I am really torn about this place. I went on Friday for lunch and was extremely impressed with the menu. The service was a tad on the slow side but the food was amazing. I was so impressed with the place that I went back the next day for brunch. I feel that most of their staff(my server(same server both days) excepted) had no sense of urgency. My server was really friendly and knowledgeable but extremely over worked. she had way too many tables to be able to provide any sort of decent service. It was a total let down the second time, that being said I will most definitely give it a third try but during the week not on the weekend. 

Food
Greek Chicken Sandwich- 5/5 huge, amazing
Cream of curry carrot soup- 5.5/5 absolutely outstanding
Smoked turkey and avocado sandwich- 4/5 
dill scrambled eggs with smoked salmon bagel-2.5/5 i was very disappointed with this dish, partly because I was thought it was something completely different but the eggs were overdone and the smoked salmon  tasted fishy"}
{"text":"Zoe's has been around, been there, tried that, and continues on with its reputation as a solid breakfast, lunch, and brunch spot. It's spacious, and unlike anything you will find in the area around it, half below ground with sunlight seemingly streaming in from all different angles, there is a look and feel that's unique and impressive. My breakfast was excellent, eggs benny with ham instead of the usual bacon. The fruit salad was delicious and delicate with an appetizing blend of precisely diced pieces of fruit. The best part by far though was the coffee. Illy which is awesome in itself, but a bottomless cup?? Which magic door did I go thru to pass into a friendly diner on the western prairies? Fantastic service topped it all off."}
{"text":"I go to Zoe's a lot cause I work next door.  Coffee's are awesome, better than Starbucks.  Quiche's are my go to item, quick and easy to take out.  I'm sure over the years I've eaten most things on the menu, all are good but pricey, they are definitely on the high end for what they are serving.  I've also used them for catering large events a few times and they were excellent, presentation was super cute and portions were right on."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for lunch after a super relaxing morning at Body Blitz nearby. 

My mom, who had been there before, was raving about it. The space is really nice and light for being semi-underground. And the menu: 90% sandwiches. They have almost every permutation of a normal, delicious sounding sandwich (i.e. no Kraft Dinner with a fried egg), including PB&J on challah. The prices were really reasonable and the portions were HUGE.

If you work in the neighbourhood this would be a great place to pick up a giant lunch for yourself or even take a colleague for a casual business lunch (they're licensed!). 

Coffee was yummy and service was friendly."}
{"text":"I've lived in this area for years and have never been here.  It's actually quite a large space but looks small from the outside.  

The wait time for cooked foods is a little excessive.  The breakfast sandwich we got was overpriced.  Might as well go to Tim Hortons.  Seriously.  For half the price and half the wait.  Not impressed at all.

No need to go back."}
{"text":"Zoe's is within walking distance of both my office and my home, so this is a standard place to meet. 

First, the good stuff:
- huge menu with lots of tasty food and a good vegetarian selection
- delicious coffee, they know how to make both a good latte and a good cappuccino.
- amazing, delicious, really fucking good desserts. they're brownies and tarts are out of the world.
- the majority of the staff are friendly and awesome. 
- the space is huge, clean, with a pretty laid back vibe.

The not-so-good:
- They advertise and stock gluten-free desserts but they are pre-packaged treats. Not really what I was expecting from a cafe advertising them on their placard outside. They're pretty tasty but not as good as the stuff they make fresh in the cafe.
- The prices are high but not high enough for me go elsewhere.
- Although they have a patio, the patio is not licensed. Boo to that.

The bad...
- The catering orders we order at work, platter type things with fruit and bagels, have gotten smaller over time (we've actually changed breakfast caterers because of it).
- The service is slow. So slow  on some days,  it's next to impossible to eat lunch within an hour here. It's great if you want a leisurely lunch, though.

An anecdote:
I ordered a vegetarian pad thai (delicious by the way, but don't expect an \"authentic\" pad thai) and got the vegetarian stir fry instead. When I mentioned it to the waitress, she made the fix but it meant watching my friend pretty much finish his lunch while I waited. On the upside, I got the feeling they made it fresh and they did give my friend and two free brownies and took my Orangina off the bill. They turned a fail into a decent result, I'm just glad I wasn't in rush."}

{"text":"Try the Dragonfly Salad ...

My wife and I had lunch there on Dec. 8, 2015. As I was eating my salad greens, I looked down at the salad and saw something weird. I looked closer and it was a 2 inch long wing sticking up from the salad. I moved a leaf away and there was a 3 inch long dragonfly in the middle of the salad ... wings, body and giant bug-eyed head. The two of us were very grossed out and should have taken a photo of the insect with our phones, but didn't think of it at the time (we were so stunned) -- we've never encountered anything like this before in all our years of eating out in Toronto.

We told our waiter (who was very nice and trying the best he could) about it. After consulting with the kitchen staff, he told us that the salad greens come to the restaurant pre-washed and bagged and the insect must have been in the bag. Clearly, the kitchen staff should have checked the contents of the bag before the salad was served and discarded everything.  One thing for sure... we won't be going back to Zoe's. Gross!!"}
{"text":"Beware of dining room area rats as you enjoy your lunch! No kidding, we went for a nice quick lunch yesterday and saw a large rat (approx. the size of a 3 month old cat with a long nasty tail) scurry across the INSIDE dining area. It made its way from the banquette area toward the kitchen and we were horrified and wanted to leave right away. We did not even fully finish our lunch and we told our server immediately. He kind of questioned us, looked around then came back and proceeded to ask us if we wanted coffee or desert. Totally CRAZY right? I think what is most disturbing (aside from the rat) is their response and actions after this occurrence. It was regular business as per usual, they proceeded charged us for our lunch and did not really do anything...actually not even sure they  apologized, no attempts to make a phone call, alert a manager...really nothing from our perspective. I am not sure what is going on over there but what I am certain of is that they simply don't understand that this is a serious health risk to us all and that it clearly violates their GREEN PASS from Health and Safety Canada. Please also be aware that this establishment also does a fair bit of catering around town so the next time you bite into an office or spa lunch, you could be eating rat droppings from Zoe's!"}
{"text":"Brunch on a Saturday! The patio is up and running and there are all these Torontonians desperate to be outside at 15 degrees.  I got to Zoe's early to meet a friend for a brunch date and my initial impression was negative.

I came inside and asked for the time and the man behind the counter acted like I was a crazy person. Then I explained I'd left my phone at home and had no watch....more strange looks.  I chose to sit on the cold patio but there is a ton of seating inside.  

There was hardly anyone there! Usually I have to elbow my way around for brunch but this was easy.  While outside the servers were much more polite and friendly, making me think that guy inside was a certifiable grump and I should just ignore him. When a seat on the sunny side of the patio opened up the server offered to move me there. 

We had mimosas - they were good. Then we split two of the specials: blackberry pancakes and a blackened salmon benny.  They were both SO GOOD and they didn't come with crappy garbage \"hashbrown\" filler, the benny came with REAL POTATOES. 

Great experience without having to line up down the block to eat breakfast food. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that the food here is absolutely amazing.  The trick is in finding a sandwich that appeals to your tastes.  Some sandwiches have a very subtle taste with delicate layers like the Smoked Turkey with Avocado.  Others will hit you with a bolder, richer taste like the Greek Chicken and the Herbed Chevre.

I have been eating here about once a week for the past few months and I absolutely love it.  If you go for take-out, you'll be able to place your order and make your way back to work within 10 minutes.  I have had some pretty poor service dining in, and have had to sit through more than one 20 minute wait just to get a sandwich.  Not cool.

The sandwiches are incredible.  Everything is super fresh and the serving sizes are huge.  The food is expensive, but you're getting a freshly made sandwich that's better than any I've eaten anywhere else in this city.

I haven't sampled anything else in their menu, but I've been told the food is hit or miss.  Some items are amazing, others are 'just good'."}

I reluctantly gave it another try today, and  left after waiting for an hour for to be served an overpriced half of a Nicoise salad that never came. There was one other person on the patio and the interior was virtually empty.  The last two experiences were poor as well.  I ordered a salmon salad and the salmon was dry. The waitress asked me if I would like a taste of the soup of the day.  I said yes, and she charged me for it without telling me there was a charge.  Nervy right?  A third time I was there, they mixed up my take-out order.  What could be simpler than a take out wrap?  I called them to tell them they had mixed it up and they asked me if I wanted to bring it back lol.  Offering a credit for my next visit would have been appropriate.  They'll probably never have to worry about business because there in a busy part of King West, with limited lunchtime choices, hence their attitude, but they certainly won't be seeing me in there again."}
{"text":"Zoe's is an example of an establishment with really, really overpriced cafe style food. They can afford to overcharge their customers because they know they'll pay for it. 

The service here is soooo slow. I sometimes waited 10-15 minutes to get a sandwich. I used to go in here at least once a week and I consistently found the servers to be very snooty and often not very kind.

The prices are also ridiculous. I ordered a sandwich and side salad and it came to $13! There are some good deals like the quiche and salad which is about $9. And their homemade pasta salad (like the tuna salad) is soo amazingly good. But a small will set you back $6. 

Also, their made to order salads are very, very good but super expensive. The salad nicoise is delicious and you'll feel full and healthy after you finish it but it'll cost you $15! The sandwiches are fine but again it takes them forever to make them. Their baked goods are also really, really delicious although also over priced.

If you really don't mind delicious and overpriced food, this is the place to go."}

{"text":"It's been years since I've been here last, because I was turned off my first visit.

After today, I can see nothing as changed. 
Too bad, as I (literally) live around the corner from Zoe's, and they *do* serve fresh food, although extremely pricey for what it is.
 

My LUNCH was $27.
That included: Chicken salad, peach muffin, pear juice, peach muffin and a iced latte.
Insanity? I think so.


But onto the part that's worth mentioning.

The customer service is horrific. Disgusting. 

What I just witness was upsetting enough, that I haven't even touched my lunch yet. I had to get this down quickly ... so I could give an accurate account:

Walked in around 2pm. 
The eat-in restaurant only had 2 tables filled. Outside patio was empty, except for a couple slowly drinking coffee. 


Inside? 
Waiting for orders, 3 people. One of which was a guy drinking a coffee. I noticed him specifically because he was closest to the cash, and he looked like he had been waiting around for awhile. He also looked like the very quiet type. 

6 staff fluttering behind the counter. 
None really doing anything specific. 
I'm going to assume it was the Manager (blonde haired lady) because when she came out, this was the only time I saw the employees being productive: getting paper bags out, pretending to look at imaginary food in the toaster, ect ect.
I even got to listen to an employee bitch & moan about how they didn't want to attend the 2:30pm staff meeting, once the Manager was out of earshot. 

 

After I placed my order (salad was the only thing they had to make), I sat down and watched & waited. At this time, coffee guy asked when his sandwich was coming out. One employee looked at him blankly, coffee guy replied with 'grilled cheese?'. Another employee jumped in, and said 'oh, it takes awhile. It will be out soon'.

Hm. Ok.

10 minutes later, an employee yelled out my order, avocado salad. She handed it to me. 

I asked about my iced latte. She looked down at my receipt in her hand. 
She said, 'yes? you ordered an iced latte\". 
me, \"I never got it\"
her, 'HUH?\"
me, \"i never received my iced latte. Can you please make it, so I can leave?\".
her, blank look.

By this point, I knew where this was going quickly ..... The vibe behind that counter was terrible, and it exploded with attitude. 


Then another employee (obviously the only one that had her shit together, overheard the conversation, and quickly chimed in that she'd make it now. 

While I was waiting for my latte, I mentioned that the coffee guy had been waiting a lot longer than I had for his cheese sandwich. The employee (red headed) looked down at my receipt, and sneered, 'you've ONLY been here for 10 minutes ..\" and then walked away! 

I was absolutely stunned. 
Then another employee said, \"Your chicken salad doesn't take as long as a cheese sandwich\" and again, walked away. 

I actually, quite literally, felt bad that my order was ready, when he had obviously been waiting much longer than me. I gave him a 'sorry' look, and on my way out, he thanked me for saying something about his lunch. Poor dude ... ugh. 

I shrugged, and couldn't believe what had just happened. Its your job, to make your clients happy. Remember? I just paid for a $14 salad. The coffee guy just spent $12 on a CHEESE SANDWICH! GET HIM HIS FREAKIN' SANDWICH.

Thank GOD I was given the gift certificate that paid for your food with A++++ ATTITUDE. 

What a terrible impression I've been left with.
I will NEVER EVER return.
 
 ps. the food was fresh. but whatever."}
{"text":"Something has gone down at Zoe's since last year. .. new ownership maybe? the morning crew used to be so nice, now you have 2-3 new people behind the counter that almost ignore you - and when they actually 'serve' you (and no \"good morning\" by the way!) it seems as though i'm intruding on them. For example, i simply asked the difference in price between a medium and a large (as i was scrounging for change in my purse and did not know if i had enough for a large) and the server was very short with me, pushing me aside until i dug my debit card out to pay. Yes, its just coffee, but i am a paying customer and go their frequently -- and for people who are in the 'service' industry, there should be more attentiveness to their clients...especially in this day and age when you can be knocked down quite swiftly with the likes of Yelp and social networking sites. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time to get sandwiches when I worked close by. They have a nice selection of sandwiches which were delicious! I came here after work once in hopes to grab coffee with someone only to realize they close at 6:30 :(

I did get their pasta salad dish and though it was really pricey ($8 for a small pasta salad?!), it was very filling and portions were fairly generous. I would come back again to try their brunch"}
{"text":"I came here every morning before work for the Illy coffee, and at least once during the week for lunch. The quality of the food here is great: delicious, and always fresh, though it better be for what you'll be paying (but then, if you expect to be paying less on King St in downtown Toronto, you're only kidding yourself!)
The smoked turkey & brie sandwich? Amazing. Their avocado sandwich? My FAVOURITE (oh so good, and a guilt-free lunch!) And have another coffee while you're at it.
Yes, the service is a little slow, but they do the best they can as they're always so busy. If you're going to be there at noon, when all the other 9-5ers are ALSO on lunch, then yes, you can probably expect to be waiting a while. For me? Totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Meh. Not totally impressed by this place. The staff is not very attentive. We ordered coffee and didn't get it until after our food was served. The food was good but really really greasy. The yogurt was great. And the coffees were good. All in all I probably would not go back...there are too many good places to try before just settling for so-so."}
{"text":"It took me months of living in the neighborhood to make it to this place.  First, it's not really a cafe in the sense of coffee shop.  They serve Illy espresso (my at home major brand), but it's more like a huge fancy luncheon spot.  It's not really a bakery either, so don't expect to see rows of fresh-baked breads or cute and interesting pastries.  It's like a non-chain version of Panera with fewer and more expensive food and drink options...if that helps understand the feel and setup.

I've had several of their ready-serve food items (the kitchen is always closed when I come here).  A bowl of pasta salad (I recommend the tuna and shells) with a double Americano cost $10.  A bit expensive, but not insane since it completely fills me up and gets my buzz on.  I typically arrive at 4:30pm and I'm LITERALLY the only customer in there.  The classic rock station they play is nice and not too loud.  There is free wifi and the people working here all seem very friendly and helpful (and super cute).  

It's rather strange being the only person in a such a large space in the middle of the day.  What the hell is wrong with this city?  Obviously their business revolves around the lunch crowd from surrounding businesses, but what about the thousands of people who live around here in the all the condos?  It's not more expensive than Starbucks when you really compare, so I just don't get it.  

But anyway it's not really a cafe in the standard sense (only in the broader sense which is useless these days) and so I'll probably never come back here again unless I really want to get away from people, drink great espresso, and get some work done while listening to some groovy tunes...on the other, hand maybe I'll come here everyday at this time."}
{"text":"Really amazing breakfast/brunch.

They have a great/wide selection of items on the menu & have no problem making substitutions with sides. 

I have several severe allergies & the staff were excellent about this. It was nice to hear 'no problem' with a smile, instead of 'we can't guarantee...' served up with a shitty attitude and an eye roll.

The last star was lost because they stop serving brunch-type foods quite early on weekdays.

Staff & kitchen are great with food allergies."}
{"text":"I agree with a lot of what Vanessa says. This place is not for the faint of wallet. However, I work very close to Zoe's so I have eaten here on more than one occasion. As a vegetarian, I don't always find good options but Zoe's has such a vast menu that I have managed to try something new and delicious or go back to my tried and true items. If you are a foodie and/or willing to pay more, I highly recommend this place!! I especially love their soups, (generally $6 a bowl) since they are one of the lesser priced items, generally vegetable based, and amazing concoctions. I highly highly recommend the spicy tomato black bean soup (if you can handle the heat) 
YUM!
-as far as I know they deliver but I think within a certain area"}
{"text":"Location is splendid.  Even has a patio to people watch along King street.
Brunch is excellent, and reasonably priced at $12 for their special (was poached eggs benne with roasted potatoes on english muffin and asparagus).
Toronto needs more spots like this.

Walked by here 1,000 times ... ya gotta go in.  It is so much bigger than you'd guess inside.  

My new neighbourhood brunch spot.  Period."}
{"text":"Unbelievably terrible service. They forgot half our order and simply said \"Oh you never got it? Oh, booo.\" afterwards when we asked it be removed from the bill. Totally unapologetic. Insane wait times for food that just isn't worth it. I suspect all the positive reviews are people who work there, but it's amazing they are even capable of being positive in any way."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick casual lunch.
Clean, friendly and a great selection of fresh foods.
Try to go after the noon lunch crowd as the place gets really busy."}
{"text":"Had a lovely breakfast here this morning - the staff was charming and the food was delicious and served quickly. Would recommend and will return!"}
{"text":"I frequent Zoe's quite a bit - usually for quick lunch as it is close to work.

The good: wide variety of food, from veggie to meat options, sandwiches, soups etc. As far as fast food lunch goes, the variety and selection are acceptable. 

The bad: Some of the times though are horribly overpriced, it isn't rare for me to walk out with a $15 tab on a takeout lunch. The service can also be quite slow at times especially with the lunch crowds/patio crowds during the summer.

The ugly: I once found a hair in my food! Though that can happen anywhere.

The flavored coffees here are great! And one of the few things that are decently priced."}
