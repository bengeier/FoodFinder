{"text":"I came back to Camille's because of the reliable table space, the free wifi (and proximity to CMU), and the ability to watch CNN instead of actually doing my homework.  I was pleasantly surprised by the caesar salad!  Pretty delicious, with plenty of pepper."}
{"text":"Monday, November 9, 2015, I ordered a creamy tuscan tomato soup w/grilled cheese sandwich.  The soup is a watery based and NOT creamy.  The cheese was not melted on my grilled cheese sandwich.  The chips that they put on the side all were broken.  This cost me about $8.50.  Please don't waste your money going to this place.  This is one of the worst places to eat in Charlotte ever.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Its a bit pricey but I really love their chicken salad sandwich, I think they put sunflower seeds in it, which makes it awesome. Also, try their freshly squeezed orange juice. I usually find the place pretty empty, which is nice because I can hog a good table by the window.

Try to stay away from the pizzas though, I had a pretty horrible experience first time I tried it, which scared me off the place for a while.."}
{"text":"We stopped here hoping to find a new cute spot with great coffee and food. Disappointment. The kids bop playing loudly over the speakers wasn't a good start. The coffee and pastries were less than good - store bought. Really great location with outdoor seating so hopefully it makes some changes down the road."}
{"text":"I went to this establishment on November 20th, 2012.  I walk in and nobody is standing at the cash register to greet me and ask me for my order.  I had to ask the lady to get somebody to take my order. After I gave my order I waited for 5 minutes and nobody started making my wrap.  Then when I got my wrap it was freezing cold (spicy chick wrap).  It was absolutely disgusting.  And it was close to $8.  Do not go here.  Bad service/Bad food.  Also, the boy making my wrap would not stop staring and laughing at me.  How awkward and unprofessional."}
{"text":"First time here...I had the chicken basil pesto.  Very tasty but portion size could have been a bit larger. I sat outside and enjoyed the gorgeous weather. The menu selection seemed huge so I'm sure there are many other things to try (sandwiches, paninni, wraps, salads, etc).  The soups also looked good.  I came around 1pm and the service was relatively fast.  I'll give this place another try for sure!"}
{"text":"I always order the quesadilla wrap. Delicious! Their chocolate chip cookies are great too."}
{"text":"It looks small in size, but it is quite cozy and has ample seating (booths and small wood tables with wood chairs). I went around lunch time and it was not busy. The parking lot is small, so be aware of that! The noise level was low, so this would be a great location to work/study. They have wraps, salads, soups, and sandwiches. Reasonable price for the amount you get. I was only able to eat half of my wrap in one sitting. The ambiance is quaint and the modern (Chinese lantern-like) light fixtures add some spunk!"}
{"text":"I love the chicken Cesar wrap it's my favorite...most everything iv tried Iv never been disappointed....convient location I like to get food after I get my hair done next door at the blow out place. The owner is super sweet."}
{"text":"Went on a weekend and ordered a smoothie and rice bowl.  The smoothie took forever to arrive and then they gave me a wrap and salad instead of my correct order.  When I asked the woman who brought out my order whether it was actually the rice bowl, she said yes and walked away.  since i was in a hurry i just went ahead and ate it.  Just average.  The smoothie was like a blended strawberry popsicle- far too much sugar and very processed and gross."}
{"text":"Had the spicy chieck wrap that the other gal reccomended and and a raspberry smoothie.  I was good but on the small side wish there was just a little more.  came with chips and salsa but again they were a little skimpy on that.  After I ordered I had sandwitch envy on the guy sitting next to me who had a BLT stuffed w Bacon.  Also this place in on Resturant.com so getting a 1/2 price discount made it taste a little better!"}
{"text":"Very extensive menu which was a little overwhelming at first to make a decision. I ordered the Banghok Thai Wrap which was ok. Sauce was a sweeter than I expected. Service was friendly and it was not a long wait for our food. Has it's own parking which was nice. Outdoor seating on both sides of restaurant but one side is by the traffic on Providence which was a bit noisy. Would consider coming back for a quick sandwich on the go."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Sunday afternoon with a Restaurant.com certificate in hand. The menu is extensive and can easily become overwhelming.

We ordered a quiet a few items: tuna salad, veggie wrap, a blueberry smoothie, carrot cake, and a decaf coffee. The best thing about what we ordered was the cake. Sweet and delicious. The rest was average and the coffee,even though made fresh, tasted like the coffee maker had not been cleaned. 

Nice location, ample parking, and seating outdoors. It's fine for a deli and for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden gem of Charlotte. I'm a big guy and love to eat. So when I ordered a rice bowl meal and they brought it out I almost fell over and had to pinch myself. It could have fed two. And was about 8 bucks with tax but so well worth it. I don't know if that is a normal menu item or a manager special but the quality of the food and atmosphere are well worth the price as opposed to all of the other junk out there."}
{"text":"This was lunch.  Cute, clean, order at the counter and take a table.  Server brings your order.  Has the feel of a ladies tea room and you will see a lot of women eating here.  Sandwiches, lots of salads, soups, wraps and desserts.  And nicely laid out.

Service is on you.  The menu is on the wall and it will take you some time to decide, so stand back and peruse.  The counter people will answer your questions and make substitutions or adjustments to your taste.  Very nice people work there.

Portions are reasonable, but not a place to go if you are really hungry.  Why you don't see many guys here, or those that are, like me, are with a lady.

Avoid peak hours as there is not an abundance of seating.  Many tables host just two people.

They offer a lot of smoothies.  Lots of them.  We did not imbibe, but they were popular.

And it is not a sidewalk place but an indoor cafe with limited outside seating.  So why a sidewalk cafe?  Maybe you can figure it out.  Your female friends will think you pretty special, in a nice way, if you take them here with you."}
{"text":"Sloooooow food prep and less than great food.  There are tons of choices, so maybe I chose poorly on my visit.  I had to wait an incredibly long time for my sandwich, though, and had trouble communicating with the staff.  The sweet tea and the unsweet tea tasted exactly the same- unsweet.  The staff wasn't able to understand that, though.  They did smile a lot and say thank you, however.

After my \"meh\" lunch I went back to the counter for a cookie.  That was really good.  The place wasn't busy when I arrived, but was hopping by the time I left.  Everyone else was waiting a long time, too.  Hopefully it was just an off day."}
{"text":"Should have read the reviews before going here.  Service was okay and people are friendly but the food is just not good.  I had the Pesto Grilled Chicken sandwich with tomato soup.  The grilled chicken was from like a frozen precooked package and the tomato soup was just stewed tomatoes with Italian seasoning, did not taste good at!"}
{"text":"Camille's seemed like an OK place to go for lunch. The menu had a lot of options - sandwiches, paninis, wraps, salads and flatbread pizzas. I tried the pepperoni pizza, which was pretty good for a non-pizza place. My boyfriend wasn't too impressed with his roast beef panini. 

The atmosphere is cute, although we walked in through the street entrance (which is kind of the back door because the main entrance faces the parking lot in the back) and couldn't really figure out which line to wait in, etc. After we ordered, we weren't sure whether they'd call out numbers or bring us our food. Seems like they just need to improve communication a bit."}
{"text":"Camille's is one of my favorite quick stops for lunch.  Extensive menu with lots of healthy options, however, I can't help but order the same thing every time!  Apple-Walnut Tuna Sandwich on Whole Wheat Bread:  freshly made apple-walnut tuna, Swiss, lettuce, tomatoes, sunflower seeds, sprouts, mayo.  I'm also a fan of their flavored tea.  YUM!!  Sometimes you just can't teach an old dog new tricks....."}
{"text":"I tried their vegetarian eggplant sandwich, and it was terrible.  There were also flies everywhere.  Pretty gross."}
{"text":"The service was a little inattentive, and the place was pretty busy...however, I love smoothies and exciting sandwiches, so I forgive them for being a bit slow. It's a cute restaurant with a solid, interesting menu if you don't have to hurry. I don't recommend it for lunches when you're working, as you might run over. 

I like the Veganini. Who can turn down goat cheese? I also enjoy the Blueberry Cozumel smoothie. The smoothies are awesome here, but the blueberry is the best."}
{"text":"This friendly neighborhood Camille's is better than its less-than-stellar star rating. The motive behind this short review is to ease anyone's worry who's been on the fence about giving this place a fair go. No, nothing is SUPER overpriced. No, the ingredients aren't rotten. And no, the service isn't absent nor unfriendly. I have to agree with one reviewer who considered this caf√© a hidden gem for this area of Charlotte... Camille's is bright, clean, and conducive to a bit of productivity... WITHOUT all the crowded hassle that's so typical of Dilworth, East Blvd, SouthEnd, etc. I'm certainly a fan."}
{"text":"CLOSED.

This place used to have OK sandwiches. Their soups were good. It is now on the list of dead restaurants and coffee shops eaten by Pittsburgh.  Sad, but not as sad as the death of the Mo-Glo..."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. A little pricey but worth it. Got a hot wrap with side salad and everything was fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I ordered a pesto breakfast sandwich, which was supposed to contain eggs, rice, and veggies. After examining the inventory for about ten minutes, the pubescent staffer told me there was no rice, could he substitute more veggies instead? Though mildly annoyed, I could probably use more veggies in my diet anyway, so I said why not. Then I watched in horror as he grabbed a carton of pre-made egg product from the counter (who knows how long it had been there?) and microwaved my little egg-patty. I never saw the carton enter the fridge. The kid was nice enough and the price was reasonable, plus the sandwich tasted better than I thought it would, probably thanks to the quality pesto sauce, but I wouldn't come here again for hygenic reasons."}
{"text":"I have been here twice so far pretty good - sandwich wise. I tend to try to beat the rush for lunch time so I generally go at non-peak hours. I tried the Ham and Swiss as well as the Turkey Club. The Ham and Swiss was so-so but I loved the Turkey Club. The Club was huge.. I gave the other half to a friend who forgot her lunch .  They give you chips and salsa.. I'm not a fan of the chips or the salsa but the sandwiches are usually big enough to fill me up.  To me it's kinda hidden, I always miss the turn off of third street so I have make the next right and then go into the parking lot from there. The space is kinda small and not much parking but overall a nice lunch spot."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I ordered the avocado salad with bacon and I must say I was not satisfied. The bacon tasted stale so I called immediately to let them know about the quality of the bacon. I was told they were busy and that my call would be returned, however, that never happened so I showed up after work and the store was closed. The next day I called and I was dealt with in a very rude manner. I was told by one person that the bacon was a day old and another person told me bacon is made fresh. Either way, someone was lying."}
{"text":"The people that take your order are very friendly and there is plenty of room and a small patio area (on 3rd).  I've been there several times though and I'm just not into it that much.  It seems like they have an extensive menu & I've tried breakfast there, but there is usually an error with my food and it just doesn't seem fresh.  The place also doesn't seem that clean.  I don't know what their food grade is though.  It is convenient, though and it's not horrible. So, it's really B-OK.  Maybe that could be a new rating...B-OK; A little better than Meh when there aren't any other options next door."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is great.  Ordered the ceasar wrap with rice and chicken. It was delicious. The service was horrible.  They answered the phone and apparently took catering or food orders while the noon lunch crowd just piled up in the line.  I had my order taken and I sat, waited for my tray to come up...brought it to my table and sat waiting for them to take my friends order (who was right behind me) so she could join me.  If I had not waited, I would have been done with the entire meal by the time she had her food.  Two registers open and no one handled the line."}
{"text":"hands down my favorite place for lunch when I am at work. The food is fresh with a nice clean finish. I am completely addicted to the turkey club sandwich on wheat toast. Never ate inside but they are super fast for carry out. sooo good... wished they delivered (well, other than for catering orders)"}
{"text":"Ever went into a lunch cafe and looked at the sandwiches listed and went: 'mehh, i don't know'  because there isn't anything really jumping out at you.  you see the obligatory turkey and ham sandwiches but after a while your looking for what you will settle for instead of what you want. 
i didn't feel that way here.  there was a lot to consider on the menu and i was interested in several of the items.  my path was clear though: the Apple-Walnut Tuna.

i have to try a tunafish sandwich if its on a menu especially if it has an interesting spin on it.  I had the tuna on wheat bread and it came toasted.  i enjoyed it.  the tuna was good and the apple slices were fresh and i was happy they didnt overdo it with the walnuts.  tomato and lettuce was fresh and the sunflower seeds gave it some crunch. i would have liked a little bit more apple but thats really nitpicking an overall exceptional sandwich.

this came with some salsa and chips which i felt were an adequate amount.  the salsa wasnt bad at all.  there were other side options like a bowl of fruit which looked like it was fresh.  I also had some sweet tea which i was happy with.

place was busy but i didnt feel like the staff were slow, it was just busy in there.  clean environment and efficient.  

the menu has breakfast and smoothies and dessert options as well, but i cant vouch for them.  i would revisit this place if i am in the area, give it a try."}
{"text":"I went to the new location at the University. The restaurant looked clean and new. The menu was up on the wall. Soups, salads, wraps and sandwiches on the board revealed an excellent variety. I ordered the chicken salad on croissant with sunflower seeds and bean sprouts. The chicken salad had dill mixed in. It was excellent!  The croissant was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. Perfect. The sandwich came with a side of tortilla chips and salsa. The two ladies working there were super nice! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was in a rush this morning, and everything pretty much opens at noon on Sunday's, so I was delighted to know they serve breakfast and lunch starting at 10am. There is an entrance in the front or back of the building. Private parking off the street in the back of the building. This is my second time here, but I was only able to enjoy a caramel latte my first visit, which was delicious. Inside Camille's is very clean, great decor, bright bold colors, wide seating area, clean tables, and an awesome menu serving breakfast and lunch. I got to meet the owner today, and Shelly was very nice and sweet. She prepared my order in no time and offered to top off my smoothie, after drinking half of it before leaving with my order. Their location is covenant and right on the corner of Baldwin Ave. They are also hiring for staff and the Gopher that picks up lunch for their business gets FREE LUNCH. Long story short, a great lunch helps me have a great day. Thanks Shelly"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Ran in for a healthy, quick lunch and the grilled chicken on the salad was that chewy, gross chicken strip chicken from a bag! Blek! Was expecting a fresh, hot piece of grilled chicken."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in my takeout experience from Camille's.  Not good at all...my chicken sandwich was mainly chewy bread and my smoothie was pure ice and not much taste."}
{"text":"So, it had been a while since I had been, and remembered it being okay, so I thought I'd drive over and give it a hot. I ordered the tomato soup & turkey deluxe. The service, again, was very slow! The staff seemed pretty involved in their own conversations rather than working. So, I got home and my turkey deluxe, which should have been turkey, Swiss, lettuce, tomato & bacon...no bacon, ugh! In addition there was one piece of turkey. I will say the chips & salsa, I guess the automatic side, were good. Definitely disappointed with my return visit :-(."}
{"text":"I stupidly came here and ordered a create your own half sandwich half salad  and am totally regretting it. Should have Linux G's review before coming here. The salad is changing color! Camilles used to have really good greens for salads but, in an attempt to cut costs I'm sure, opted for old romaine. The sandwich had no Apple or walnut at all. Its not worth the 8 plus dollars in my opinion. 

I won't return ever again, learned my lesson this time. Should have gone to Pizzeria Omaggio or Earl's Grocery, ended up spending the same."}
{"text":"A little on the pricier side, but I love the wraps and paninis. I wouldn't mind coming by here again to try their other sandwich combinations. The turkey habanero (which wasn't hot.. the habanero part was a mango-habanero sauce... there was also some no-threat standard red peppers and pepperjack cheese) was quite tasty. The side salsa was pretty good. Yummeh.

Keep an ear out for your name... because if you don't hear the regular calls, it will come through a very loud speaker.

And if you're going to eat in, please do bus your table. They're not going to get to it soon, and it would just be courteous for the next folks wanting to sit down."}
