{"text":"Went for brunch on a sunday at 11am.  The place was pretty busy, but our group of 4 only had to wait about 10 minutes and we were given a spot at the bar.  Love the decor and the fact that none of their coffee mugs match.  Our food was good, service was great and we had a good time.  I don't understand the complaints about parking- we found a spot down the street.  Heaven forbid you have to walk an extra 50 feet.  We loved it and will be back!"}
{"text":"It's hard for me to only give Zada Jane's a 1-star review, because my husband and I have relatively enjoyed our experiences here thus far. But after yesterday, I have to say this place has probably been taken off our list of regular spots.   We decided to stop in on a Sunday afternoon for a bit of brunch before our 3 o'clock appointment. 2 hours should have been plenty of time, right? Apparently not. We were told the wait for a table would be about 20 minutes; 45 minutes later we were finally sat, after watching several tables remain empty on the patio the entire time we waited. Given those 45 minutes, we had plenty of time to look over the menu so we could put in our order right away. By the time we ordered our drinks and food (at the same time) it was about 2 o'clock.   By 2:30, I'd had enough. Our waitress didn't check on us the entire time we sat there. 40 minutes without a table touch... 30 MINUTES. We finally tracked her down and told her we needed our food to-go, as we had somewhere to be. She assured us she'd go check on our food and have them put it together as quickly as possible. But this seems to be relative, as 10 minutes later she returns and tells us it'll be another 5 minutes before our food could be brought out. Unfortunately at this point, we'd already decided to pay the bill preemptively because, despite everything, we were hungry. Bad move on our part, I will say.   Finally, our food was brought out by (what I assumed to be) a manager, because she gave us a gift certificate for our trouble. However, this seemed to be only an afterthought when my husband brought up how long we'd had to wait for a table and for our food on top of that. I felt it should have been our waitress that tracked down a manager for that sort of thing.   On top of all of that, they put the wrong ingredients in my husband's order of the Bunny Rancheros. If the food was fantastic, I might be inclined to give them another chance. But, unfortunately, it's a bit average, and the headache is not worth it. Guess we'll have to find someone else to use our $25 certificate. Any takers?"}
{"text":"Today, I found myself disappointed in Zada Jane's. How is that even possible, you ask...  Well, I ordered take-out and their usually quality was lacking.  I requested my eggs scrambled and what I got was a heap of fried egg pieces. The consistency of that I my mouth was unforgivably gross.  It was rubbery and not at all what I wanted or what I am used to from them.  I was hoping that the rest of my meal would make up for the egg debacle, but it did not. Highly disappointed.  The pancakes tasted like someone had contaminated the batter and it had an aftertaste of something with garlic or some other non-sweet spice and my grits had a slightly burnt aftertaste.  I'm not sure WTH happened in the Zada Jane's kitchen today, but it definitely didn't work for my taste buds. I'd been craving ZJ's for hours today and in the end it was a totally bust.   Sorry, ZJ's - but today, you really let me down."}
{"text":"Finally got to check out Zada Janes this weekend for brunch. I had the special blueberry and strawberry pancakes, sadly came out missing any strawberries and sparse on the blueberries. Boyfriends hash was reeeeeally good, I'll try the savory breakfast options next time. Service was slow and uninterested."}
{"text":"Dinner menu has changed from what is posted on their website. Went last night and couldn't  find a lot that I wanted to eat since I don't eat chicken, pork, beef,  bison, etc.  No more NoDa Salad or Kafka burger for dinner.  Orr server informed us that these items are only available for lunch.  No soup offered either.    I really hadn't planned on spending more than $20 but with wine ($8) and my main course which was either $16 or $18, it was a lot more.  Also, when our server said bottles of wine were half-priced on Sundays, I switched from ordering a beer to a Cotes du Rhone.  However, she brought a glass of wine and not a bottle of wine, and when I asked about the bottle, her response was \"this was what you ordered, wasn't it?\".  So, she either wasn't paying attention when I ordered or just forgot by the time she ordered it since I didn't see her write it down. All in all, an OK evening.  At least the weather outside was gorgeous.  I probably will stick to breakfast or lunch from now on since the evening menu is now very meat heavy.  No pasta options as on the previous menu. (I will certainly miss the shroom ravioli!)"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, but the last time was not the most enjoyable experience. I will give them the benefit of the doubt since everyone was trying to use their expiring livingsocial deal...as was I. There was an hour wait to be seated, then once we were seated, there was another hour wait for my food. When I asked what the hold up was, the waitress checked and said that the order did not reach the kitchen, even though she had put it in...what?? She basically forgot to put it in.  When we finally got our food, it was pretty good. They were out of the chicken which I wanted, so I ended up getting the steak. No complaints on the food. The manager came to speak to us and offered me a $25 gift card. So I will be going back there at least one more time."}
{"text":"I am a fan. Unfortunately for me my day of choice is Sunday for egging it up. Sunday is usually the OMG did I really drink ALL of that last night and the only thing that could make me feel better is the Bunny Ranchero day. Well, this Sunday was no different except we thought we could beat the crowd if we got up early. So we set the alarm and rolled outta bed, brushed the choppers and were there by 9:15 'ish. Dang if the patio wasn't completely filled already. Did these people sleep here? So, to the bar we went. Roger the owner is also the quirky fellow behind the bar. He always makes me laugh. On this occasion I decided against the Bunny Ranchero and switched it up for something sweet. I had the last piece of pecan cake which was just what the doctor ordered. Served on the cake plate itself with dollop's of whipped cream so you can saver all the crumbs, that, and a coffee in a chipped mug made me feel like I was home. I like the whole vegan, vegetarian vibe. I am not a fan of cows and piggies... I mean I like them so I don't eat them and for me, I feel like they have a great variety of protein options. I just wish so many others didn't feel the same way, well at least on Sunday mornings."}
{"text":"Being an Asheville native, Zada Jane's feels familiar. Sunny Point, Early Girls, Over Easy; they all came to mind the first time I walked in. It wasn't until I had a pleasant conversation with a Zada Jane's founder that I learned this feeling is not a coincidence, or blind admiration, but instead a calculated effort. \"I love Asheville\" he said. \"I lived there for many years and miss going to places like Sunny Point. Charlotte needs more places like that.\" I couldn't agree more.   The food has been above average the half-dozen meals I've had at Zada's, though somewhat inconsistent. It seems the later it is, with fewer people inside, the better the food tastes. You certainly won't find a better eggs dish any where in town at 9:45pm on a weeknight.     If located in downtown Asheville, Zada's may be viewed in a different light. It's out matched by Sunny Point and Over Easy. But in the Queen City, Zada's it's in a class of it's own."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now.  The first time was for brunch, and I thought it was really good.  Very eclectic, with a neat mix of neighborhood folks and a wonderful breakfast menu.  So, in my head it became a breakfast place.  However, my husband has gone there several times for dinner at times when I've been out of town or unable to join him, and he always said it was good.    Last night, I was craving something a little naughty (you know, cheesy, gooey, etc).  We were having a hard time trying to decide where to go, and I happened upon the Zada Jane's website and menu.  They have a really cool interpretation of nachos that sounded so good to me that we decided to go there.  Even after hearing about the specials, I stuck to my initial idea about the nachos, with chicken on top.    Let me just tell you, I couldn't have been more pleased.  They have black beans, grilled zucchini, and corn covered in a very creamy manchego cheese sauce, topped with guacamole and sour cream.  So, it was a healthy-ier version of nachos with all of the yummy stuff that makes nachos great!  This is something that I'll order again (and again), and changed my thoughts about Zada Jane's being just a breakfast place.  It is actually a great neighborhood spot for any time of day.    The wait staff is incredibly friendly, and the chocolate cake rocked.  Go try Zada Jane's!"}
{"text":"I've been to Zada Jane's maybe 7 or 8 times before, but I was compelled to write a review this time because of the terrible and extremely frustrating service. To preface with a few quick points-- - I lived in NYC for 5 years, so I'm very familiar and comfortable with a long wait - I used to be a server and understand the circumstances outside their control - I still think the food is fantastic (top quality, great preparation, inventive recipes)  However on my last visit, the service was shockingly consistent in it's rudeness, ineptness and mistakes. There were a few key small gestures or things said by the wait staff which could have greatly improved the experience, but this didn't seem to be in the interest of the waitress. I completely understand the situation at a busy, popular place and I usually sympathize with waiters, but there was no benefit of the doubt to give this time so unfortunately I won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have dined at Zada Jane's on a number of occasions (both breakfast and lunch). After each dining experience, we have to ask ourselves ... why do we keep going back? Perhaps it's the offbeat location, the idea of a down to earth meal, or support for a local Charlotte establishment. Well I believe the verdict is in for our family. Zada Jane's is simply a poorly managed restaurant. Don't believe the hype, the service is terrible and the food is mediocre. For our dining dollars, consistently good eats along with great service are a must no matter what \" restaurant concept\" you are peddling."}
{"text":"Can't miss Zada Jane's as you drive down Central.  Many order the breakfast which is served all day and is fresh and delicious.  But everything is good.  Try the Chicken Sandwich with caramelized onions and some sort of basil-pesto sauce that is out of this world.  The co-owner, Roger, is a great guy.  Cool art on the wall.  Must sit outside on a nice cool morning.  Expect to wait to be seated for breakfast/brunch.  But there is obviously a reason for this and it gives you time to play cruise-ship shuffleboard!  Yes, indeed!"}
{"text":"Same great food. Same unimpressive service."}
{"text":"Love a great breakfast place. While in Charlotte, decided to give Zada Jane's a try, based mostly on the reviews. Went on Friday 7/3, during the 4th weekend.   I'm from Atlanta and, at first, I thought this place was a knockoff of the Flying Bisquit (which, by the way, I understand has opened one in Charlotte). The same eclectic decor and a very similar menu.  Food is quite good. However, the service was atrocious. I asked the owner if the slow service was due to lack of help on a holiday weekend and she said it was.   Like an idiot (mostly because my wife insisted) I gave it another try the next day. Slightly better service but pretty much the same results. The best part was that they have a patio area where we can take the dog while we eat. Lots of people, many with dogs.  The food is good enough to give it one more try but not on a holiday weekend."}
{"text":"I ended up here for lunch with a couple friends and going in we knew nothing about this restaurant.  The interior was fun but the service a little awkward.    We immediately noticed that the lunch selections were very limited and it seemed to be more of a breakfast/brunch place.  I had the hummus wrap which wasn't bad.  My friends had the nachos and their turkey sandwich.  Overall we were not too excited about our experience.    I think that I will save this for a special occasion breakfast until then I will be somewheres else."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and me went to Zada Jane's a few weeks ago on a Friday night.  Very few patrons were in the restaurant.  We waited ten minutes before someone came by to take our drink order.  Our wine was served in dirty glasses.  We then asked to add turkey to one of the regular entree's and was told it was going to be a $6.00 upcharge! The food was average at best. After we finished eating, we still had to wait another ten minutes to check out.  We were very disappointed on multiple levels."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on Sunday after church with friends. About a 50 min wait to eat outside.SO And I had the south no north or whatever the name was--- peppers, Caramelized onions, ham omelette with a biscuit and sweet potato side. Definitely 10/10. The sweet potatoes were especially divine. Large portions and felt the price was reasonable. Our vegan friends were happy that they had several options on the menu and enjoyed a tofu curry dish. Took off a star for the horrific service. Waiter was friendly but was manning far too many tables. There needed to be more staff to deal with the huge crowd of customers."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed having brunch at Zada Jane's with some friends from out of town one weekend.  Overall good food, great bacon, nice atmosphere and friendly service.  It was very busy, but I did not feel rushed and there was plenty to keep me entertained during the short wait to be seated.  The shuffleboard outside was a nice touch.  The food was good and I enjoyed my experience.  Highly recommend the bacon."}
{"text":"I went to Zada Jane's for the 1st time on Friday (3/25) with my wife. We got there at 10:45am. We were told that it was a 20 minute wait, so I stated that we would wait outside until our table was ready. 20 minutes later, I came back in and confirmed with the hostess that we were still waiting. At 11:15, I noticed that people were being seated and they came after us. The hostess said she thought we were eating outside even though I mentioned that we we will wait on on a table. We finally got seated at 11:25. We ordered our food. I had the Vegless Avenger and my wife had chicken nachos. We awaited AN HOUR to get our food and it was OK. There were others around us who came BEFORE us and got their food AFTER us. I wont be coming back."}
{"text":"Very unique breakfast options at moderate prices.  The plates come out stacked with food- couldn't finish the whole breakfast. Everything we ordered was delicious. Big booth set ups which are great for going with a bunch of friends.   The atmosphere is casual and relaxed."}
{"text":"We got the Groupon to visit Zada Jane's and it was overall worth it. The food was incredible! We ordered short ribs and the mushroom ravioli with a couple glasses of wine. Absolutely 5-star delicious. HOWEVER, we sat in the corner, so we could people watch and saw some kitchen-nightmares behavior from the staff.   Customers would walk in, and stand by the door waiting to be acknowledged and seated. The staff would walk around them and not make eye contact. Finally, someone behind the bar area would call out that they could sit where they wanted. When we first walked in, we experienced this too. but the restuarant wasn't as busy then, so they acknowledged us faster. This could be solved with a simple sigh by the door that says \"Please seat yourself\".   Other than that, we really enjoyed Zada Jane's. We'll come back the next time we are in town... at least now we know to seat ourselves!"}
{"text":"No matter when I've gone - weekday, weekend, morning, or not, I've never had service worth a damn.   But the food...   Oooh, the food.   So, SO good. Locally sourced ingredients and compelling receipts (that's Southern for \"recipes,\" y'all, I didn't misspell it) keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Zada Janes's many times. The experiences have run the gamut.  Sometimes, there has been no wait at all, one time, my party waited over 30 minutes until we noticed people being seated who arrived after us.  Sometimes, the service is great (sitting at the bar when Charlotte is working. Other times it's been slow and frustrating (messing up orders, not reflling coffee, etc.)  The food has been delicious on all but one occasion.  After my first few visits, this was a favorite brunch place to take out of town visitors, but now seems too erratic to risk it.  I've spoken to the owner about one of the bad experiences, while he was apologetic, things don't seem to have improved."}
{"text":"Best place to have breakfast on the planet.  Get the Bunny Ranchero.  It's incredible."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place is so popular.  I waited an hour for an average breakfast.  I just ordered eggs, bacon and potatoes. I didn't try any of the more creative options. I will give this place another try, and order some of the specialty items; but I don't expect my opinion to change much."}
{"text":"I wish I could recommend this place but after being here several times I always find their food lacking, lacking in substance, in appearance.  However the place is pretty nice, love the location although some times it requires street parking or creative parking.  And the serving is unfailingly good.  But I go there to eat and they just don't get it right.   The time before last I ordered the bunny rancheros.  I chose the sausage and should have chosen something else, it was just meaty and salty but the rest seem decent when she came to ask how were we finding the meal.  The first two bites, tasty, but then the hash brown/home fries were actually hard, as in not cooked long enough.  And the black beans were really dry, must have been in a pot for a long time.  By then I had eaten one forth of the meal so decided to concentrate on the good stuff.  It did have good avocado and the eggs were cooked correctly, over easy, although one came already broken, but you couldn't  tell because it had broken underneath. One of my friends had nachos and those were good.  I've been there just for coffee, and that is very good, strong and tasty.  For $2.75 you get refills.  So the last time I decided to play it safe and order the nachos to share with a friend as well as a salad.  The result is I will not be back there for food.  The chips were old, not super old, the kind of old you think they don't taste good but since they are a little wet you don't know for sure.  But when I asked my girlfriend she agreed.  I had ordered it with chicken.  I think Moe's gives you far more chicken, we couldn't find it.  It came with a scoop of guacamole that had that yellowish color like when it has been sitting around.  There was little cheese in it.  And while it was supposed to come with veggies we did find some zucchini but it was layered with a bunch of lettuce, including the very hard bottom of a lettuce.  Definitely subpar but with the chips being old not worthy at all.  The salad was ok.    They want to go for the natural organic vibe and they fall way short in their food.  I would recommend it for coffee only."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is just simply a good place to eat breakfast! The food is always good and fresh. They feature \"happy eggs,\" which always makes me feel better about what I am eating. The service is friendly and attentive. This place is defiantly a Charlotte favorite!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Zada Jane's twice: once solo, probably close to a year ago, and once with my s.o., just this past weekend.  I spotted Zada Jane's (but didn't eat there) while in the Plaza Midwood neighborhood in Winter 2008 ... oh, and I came down with a vicious case of influenza later that evening! Despite having body and mind ravaged by this particularly agressive strain, I managed to retain enough memory of the exterior of the building to locate it and finally eat there several months later. My experience that initial time wasn't particularly memorable ... the service was fine, though: I had a nice beer, a dish that involved falafel, and ran into a friend of my college roommate from freshman year at Appalachian State. I'm a native of Rutherford County, an hour west of Charlotte, and I've never been a big fan of the city -- I'd much rather drive an hour to Asheville for my cultural activities. However, Plaza Midwood surprised me, and I knew that, when passing through or near Charlotte, I would make it a point to return.  That happened this past weekend. After taking a job-related certification exam in Thomasville, I met up with my girlfriend and her friends for a birthday celebration at Carowinds. My s.o. and I are not big theme-park fans, but we enjoyed ourselves; when the groups separated, though, I knew that she would appreciate deviating from the consumerist excesses that we'd just experienced, so we drove into Charlotte, through the Myers Park area, asked directions to Plaza Midwood from a nice couple out for an evening walk, and made our way to the parking lot behind Zada Jane's.  We arrived sometime after 8, were promptly given our choice of tables on the patio, and were reasonably quickly attended to. Our server was young, bright, friendly, and not at all snobby, and we jumped at the first special she mentioned: an appetizer of heirloom tomatoes topped with fresh mozzarella, mango salsa, basil, and balsamic vineger. We weren't disappointed, as this turned out to be one of the highlights of the meal. My s.o ordered another special -- lentil gespacho, the soup of the day -- and a crabcake sandwich, while I went for breakfast at night: Bunny's Rancheros. I'm not a shellfish enthusiast, but I enjoyed the bite I had of her sandwich; the soup d'jour, on the other hand, was downright remarkable. And I enthusiastically ate bunny's eggs, y'all; it was probably the best dish of huevos rancheros I've ever eaten, and that's saying a lot considering the terrific versions of this available at Sunny Point in West Asheville.  Overall a great experience: friendly, helpful staff; reasonably quick service (in spite of the restaurant's patio filling up QUICKLY  after we arrived); and seriously impressive food quality and complexity of flavors. Would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone.   After leaving this dream meal/date location, we went to the much less enjoyable Rock Bottom to enjoy a quick drink with the birthday crowd at this corporate take on the brewery-restaurant genre. I have to admit: my girlfriend and I looked upon our friends' food (and enjoyment of same) with a mix of pity and contempt following the impressive, local meal we had just consumed."}
{"text":"Not a whole lot of options for vegan, more so for vegetarians but non-the-less the friendly staff and great prices make this place a staple in my casual dinning experiments.  The food can be rather hit or miss. The roasted potatoes are my staple food and they're good about 65% of the time, once though it seemed like they gave me potatoes that had been sitting out all day then thrown back in a skillet for 2 mins.  The staff is friendly as can be, the environment is pleasing, but the food quality varies too much."}
{"text":"Visited Zada Jane's before had good service and the food was good.  Things have changed. I went to Zada James this morning for breakfast was told to grab a seat any where and that's all the action I got. I sat there for about 5 minutes and still not one person waited on me or laid an eyeball on me. Piss Poor Performance"}
{"text":"First time eating here. Breakfast , service, initial greeting was not friendly. Eggs were barely warm, turkey sausage was cold, stone ground grits were under cooked. Over all experience was not good ."}
{"text":"I would suggest going here and ordering your food right after you eat dinner. That way your food might (and it's a strong might) be out by breakfast the next morning.   Came here on a Saturday around 11:15. Were seated in about 15 minutes. We let our server know that we were in a bit of a hurry (bf had an appointment at 12:30 in Southend, leaving us about 45 minutes to eat) and she put our food in right when we ordered. After waiting about 25 minutes, we went ahead and paid and our server said our food would be right out. 10 minutes after that, we had to hunt down our server and have her pack up our food to go. She brought it to us a few minutes later and offered no apology for the wait. My boyfriend ate his food in the car and I'm standing at my kitchen counter alone eating mine.  There is no reason on this earth for 2 omelets to take 35 minutes to come out of the kitchen. The fact that we were in a hurry has little to do with it. We were seated with the kitchen door in our line of vision, and there were about 2 dishes coming out every 5 minutes. Are you serious? I'm also not picky about getting an apology, and I know it was not our server's fault, but I was surprised that she showed no concern.  My food is fine, albeit a bit cold since it's been in a to-go container. And while I love my boyfriend's cat, she's not great breakfast company."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. Got the pancakes on the right side of the menu! They were very good. Food came out a little late but the place was busy! Overall good experience!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I arrived excited about the diverse food selections and eclectic atmosphere. 30-40 minutes passed with excitement  replaced with irritation and minimal communication. Finally.....at last the food arrived. The banana pancakes were awesome and hubby enjoyed the Booker T. Bcuz of the wait time and the employee walking around with the visibly dirty towel hanging from his Jean pocket,  what would be a 4 star gets a 3 star rating. We will return to taste more of the items with hope that the wait isn't too long and if need be report the employee showcasing the dirty towel!"}
{"text":"Food - average Prices - absurdly high Staff - rude Atmosphere - crowded and obnoxious mix of wannabe granola/hipsters and plaza-midwood posers Advice - walk across the street to John's Country Kitchen and save yourself $10   Enjoy."}
{"text":"I'm a stickler for good food, but even more of a stickler to be treated as a person by an establishment.  I remember when Zada Jane's opened and it was comfy and you felt welcomed.  As they've grown (along with the over inflated wait), their quality of food has lessened, the service is almost nonexistent, their wait times for your meal are uncalled for and their line for the door are ridiculous.  Probably because they can;t serve people in a timely manner.  What's more disappointing; when you get the food it's nothing special anymore.  Sorry Zada Jane''s you've lost my business and I'm likely to tell newcomers that I'm just not impressed anymore.  Hopefully you'll amp up your game once more and I'll start hearing good things about you again."}
{"text":"They always say 25 minutes...  and after waiting 45 mins we just left. Go somewhere where they know how to turn tables."}
{"text":"This place is cutely decorated, but the food is not very good. Seems like all of the food is pre-cooked and then heated in a microwave. Potatoes had a rubbery texture to them and they don't appear to use local market vegetables. Honestly, I'm surprised they have stayed in business this long with the food they serve. Our server was pleasant, but we could not excused the food they served. I would definitely approach this restaurant with an open mind. They don't have the greatest food."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and after a 30 minute wait (as expected, no complaints there), waited 1 hour 20 minutes after ordering to get our food for a party of 5. During this time our server came by twice to refill coffee and not once acknowledged the long wait. The food was average. I ordered a biscuit sandwich and a side of sweet potato hash and was not thrilled by either. It was certainly not worth the wait. With so many excellent brunch places in Charlotte, I do not recommend spending your time or money here."}
{"text":"If I could give ten stars I would! I had an almond milk latte, soup and nachos. All were delicious and delivered promptly. Our server Tabitha was so attentive and sweet, and told us about the half price champagne bottles when we ordered mimosas. Love Zada Janes and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and they have so many choices! Great place to eat! I had the basic breakfast.... So much food. You get 2 eggs served any way you like, a protein, a carb and a starch. I couldn't even finish my plate. You definitely will not leave hungry!"}
{"text":"Going to school in Blacksburg, VA never thought I'd find another breakfast restaurant like Gillies on draper, but this place had a similar vibe (coincidently when we pulled into the parking lot about 10 minutes before they opened there was a van that had a Floyd, VA bumper sticker)  Food was great, we order a Bunny Rancheros with egg, guac, sour cream, potatoes, and it was good enough to order two. I also ordered their Amaretto french toast which was good but the Amaretto flavor through me off a bit and wasn't sure if I liked it or not.  Get there early as it fills up fast, and when it opened there were 5 or 6 other couples walking in to sit.   My only complaint and the reason why I didn't give them a 5 was because the coffee was $2.50, I mean I get free refills and all, but I'm not a huge fan of Dilworth coffee to begin with which they serve, and seriously, did I mention it was $2.50?"}
{"text":"We came to Charlotte to scope out the city as a possible relocation place.  We love great deals on great food and went to the Groupon site and discovered Zada Jane's.  They totally hit the mark.  I had the spinach and bleu cheese salad and hubby had a steak and potatoes dish.  BOTH WERE SCRUMPTIOUS!  Staff, service and atmosphere were perfect as well!  May move to Charlotte just to eat at Zada Jane's!"}
{"text":"Zada Jane's is awesome. I eat there at least once a week.  Great outdoor seating.  Must try."}
{"text":"The small town diner atmosphere of this place is relaxed and casual. We went on a Monday at noon and the place was busy with just a short wait for a table but could have been sat right away had we sat up at the bar. The food was good, nothing amazing to set it apart, except for the sweet potato hash. I would go just for them alone. The overall experience was nice and I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Was in town visiting friends and came to Zada Jane's. This was my first time to the south so I'd have to say it was a different style of food. I got the Booker T's East Side Hasher. I was expecting everything to be separate, was in a total mood of getting some good eggs but my eggs, sausage, and hash were cooked all together. It was definitely different than what I'm use to. I'm not sure if I'd get that one again but I'd be willing to try something different on the menu. They also have a great menu for vegetarians, offering soysauge. First time I've ever heard of it but my friend who's a vegetarian really likes it. I also wasn't a fan of their coffee but that may be my preference  Definitely in a nice area though. Wish we had more time to explore the streets! But everything seemed to be closed on a Sunday."}
{"text":"As a new resident of Charlotte (moved here in April 2014) , and living within a 5 minute walk of the restaurant, we were very excited about Zada Jane's.  Reading the reviews and talking to new friends in the area, I was expecting the restaurant to be nothing less than good.....However, after 4 visits, I AM DONE WITH THIS PLACE.  Our first experience was breakfast.  We were excited about their local food, especially the local sausage.  I ordered a breakfast sandwich with the local sausage.  I was shocked when I got a flat sandwich with dry bread, and over-cooked egg, and 1 small (about a half-dollar size) piece of sausage.  The sandwich was something I could make myself....and honestly would do a better job.  It was very disappointing, but I tried to be positive and chalked it up to a bad day for the cooks. (As a note, I ordered it again a few weeks later to see, and it was even worse).  My wife ordered the hash and it was good, so that prompted us to try Zada's again.  Since that time, I have been back three times, excluding the experiment on the second breakfast sandwich.  The second time I went, I ordered two breakfast burritos.  Being originally from Arizona, I have a pretty high standard for burritos.  Zada's did not even come close.  Food was bland, and took a lot of salsa to enjoy.  Oh and I was charged $30.00. (Tried to get a refund after, but because we paid cash we were unable to prove it.)   After that it was my wife asking to try them again, since the place is so close to our home.  I was surprised one time to get a decent tofu salad (and I hate tofu).  However, I got the wrong order (a sandwich).  Rather than ask them to re-do it, I stuffed down the wrong food and left as fast as possible.  I blame them for getting the order wrong, but me for not getting it fixed.    The straw that broke the camels back came about 2 weeks ago.  In a last attempt to try this place one more time, we placed a to-go order.  My wife, who had learned her lesson, ordered the tofu salad again....and it was good.  I tried the crab-cake sandwich and it was the worst meal yet.  Dry meat, frozen crumbly bread, no flavor.  I honestly hate to say this, but the frozen crab cakes from Costco are way better.  I will say the restaurant atmosphere is nice, but not so much so I have to go there.  It's a good location with a patio and outdoor games.....whoopy!!! (sarcasm).  Try at your own risk, but do not feel you have to like this place because a bunch folks pump it up.  To note, I rarely ever write reviews, and usually in the positive.  This place is that over-hyped to me, I felt the need to do so....it's not good food (PERIOD)"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Greeted right when I walked in. Good was excellent and fresh. Didn't take long to get my meal even at their busiest hours. Nice environment with the choice to sit where you like, indoors or out. Will defiantly go back."}
{"text":"Go when it's not busy and YOU'LL LOVE THIS PLACE.  Go when it is busy and you'll wait forever for crappy service and crappy food.  I really want to provide a good review because I like the concept of this place...but...  The staff has a high turnover rate which translates into \"there's something wrong.\"  Earlier this year, there were several great servers that I became familiar with and made me want to return regularly.  Another batch that I became familiar with have also since left.  Now, I only recognize one and he's never been my server so who knows.  The food quality and consistency rises and falls without rhyme or reason."}
{"text":"This place is the best brunch spot in Charlotte, at least that I've found. They have great food, ranging from healthy (breakfast salads) to artery-clogging (bunny rancheros, my favorite). The staff is always helpful and attentive. The only downside is that there is generally a pretty long wait on the weekends, but it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a vegetarian place and ended up here. They were a bit disorganized. They were still serving breakfast but I was not in the mood. Unfortunately the lunch options were few - salads and a few sandwiches. I had a hard time finding anything to order. I got the chopped salad, which was huge, and my husband got the spinach salad which was not as big. The salads were good but nothing I  could not fix on my own, although the dressings seem housemade and the caesar dressing was nice and peppery.  But, the service was really slow. I mean these were salads - how long could it really take? All in all I was not thrilled but would like to try for brunch or maybe dinner, on the feeling that lunch is not their strong suit. As a last note, the Asian vegetable soup was very flavorful and the standout."}
{"text":"Artsy place with great vegetarian nachos. I'll be back to try breakfast! My friend and I went on a Saturday afternoon. It wasn't crowded but it took awhile for us to get our food. My friend really enjoyed the orange zest on her amaretto French toast. The server helped me identify a song I liked that was playing on their pandora station, which was cool."}
{"text":"This place has soul- LOVE it. Zada Janes has an eclectic mix of customers; the decoration is cozy and fun; and it is one of the few restaurants in Charlotte that offers great vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good BUT you better have a couple hours free to eat there.  Wait times are long and kitchen is sloooow. We waited almost 45 minutes for our food and had to take it to go to make an appointment.  It was a little less busy than usual for a Saturday morning, so It must get really bad other times. Servers are bohemian, ours was wearing clothes that looked like they hadn't been washed in a while.  I guess that's the vibe of Plaza-Midwood but still a little gross.  We have been there several times but won't likely go again because of the wait."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to Zada Janes.  I've been several times since they opened and enjoyed my experience either sitting outside on the patio or inside at the bar to grab a bite.   Recently had a guest in town and we dropped in to have a late lunch. What a mistake!  We both ordered the breakfast salad. And were pretty appalled.   It was literally a bed of dry greens dumped on a plate with cold potato hash browns on top that appeared to have been sitting around  all day.  To boot the egg on top was cooked, but tepid.  The dressing on the side was totally misbalanced in flavor to the point where I was making the sour lemon pucker face.  I realize we went at an off time, but that is NO excuse.  The server was pleasant but not terribly good, and was also in heavy-duty sidework mode - buzzing around the place cleaning and stocking and vacuuming.   If you're going to incorporate cleaning during slower eating hours, do it one section at a time and while people are not sitting in that section.  Again, I love the location and the funky appeal of Zada's, and maybe this was just an off day and time, but I'm not inclined to go back any time soon with so many other options around town."}
{"text":"oh Zada Janes... i love the smell of the cafe.. the food.. and the huge white piece of cake in the glass cake holder on the bar.. the people that work at the place know that it gets busy.. and they are working to get you served and outta there. on a sunday, we were there right when zada's opened.. and within 10 minutes tops the entire place was full... take a glance at the menu, and decide what you want... enjoy the scenery of hipsters... and refill yer coffee mug a few times. i've only been there for breakfast, but its been good every time. i recommend the french toast and juevos rancheros. char jar."}
{"text":"Great food but one of the staff members is rude as hell. I just called to ask if there was a wait for two and all she said was \"No\" & hung up before I could even thank her lol. What a B!!! I'll still go back but just taken back by her horrible customer service."}
{"text":"We found zada janes about 4 years ago on our way to myrtle beach and make it a point to stay in Charlotte so we can get breakfast there.  We don 't go out to breakfast many places because we can't seem to replace zada janes. My wife and i order different breakfast items  each time and find it harder to choose since everything is so delicious.  This last time i had the booker t OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried out Zada Janes for lunch and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised she had the Amaretto French toast and I had the Veg less Avenger with a side of sweet potato hash browns. This place is funky , eclectic and organic ,  a bit  crowded at lunch time so get there early but worth the slight wait.Complaints about service seemed overblown on our visit wait was no longer than what we've experienced at local corporate restaurants.Enjoy."}
{"text":"Hate doing this.  Used to love Zadas, but 40 min to get food on a Monday?? Have to turn a lunch quicker...especially a salad.  And....only a dozen people in the restaurant.   Dirty tables, etc.  Not the place it used to be."}
{"text":"Gluten Free Pancakes and Sugar Free Blueberry Syrup for those lazy Sundays!"}
{"text":"Good food, great coffee but even better service.  The bar maid was exceptional and went above and beyond.  I didn't get her name but she was über cute with curly hair :). Super sweet and made us feel at home."}
{"text":"So bad. I have no idea why this place stays busy. I've been here a couple of times and it's always gross. Looking at a biscuit and gravy right now and the gravy is all mealy and has balls of flour throughout. Charlotte needs better breakfasts."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place. Great place in the Plaza Midwood area. Excellent food, nice staff. My fave are the Bunny Rancheros and the Booker T Hash. Great spot to people watch as well."}
{"text":"Zada J has the right atmosphere and perfect setting. The outdoor seating area is quite appealing and is uncharacteristically hip for a Charlotte restaurant. Reminded me of a Cali cafe.   The food was alright. Not quite as extraordinary as many seem to think. I had the East West scrambler and it was alright, but the beat part of it came from the natural taste of a sweet potato and not from much that a cook put into making it. I did, however, order a side of herbed gravy for my biscuit and that turned out to be a SUPER great choice - it was awesome and really made my meal. I recommend that to anyone who is a fan of biscuits and gravy. Very good.   This place loses stars big time for its staff though. In such a down-to-earth, homey atmosphere one would expect friendly and genuinely nice service, and what I received was neither.   My experience was that of a staff that really just wanted to get the job done and not much more. The hostess didn't give us much of a greeting at all - just a \"how many?\" coupled with tallying us on a wait list. Being our first time here we didn't know where to go to wait and were never given any direction. What we were given were trivial glances as we confusedly shuffled around looking for a place to wait. If I hadn't read other Yelpers' reviews I would have had no idea about the coffee while you wait and had to ask - you would think that would be communicated to you. When we were finally given a spot (which was a relatively short time to wait) we were hustled in and were given the impression that if we had walked any slower to our seats they would have given them up right in front of us. It was pretty uncomfortable to say the least, and very unwelcoming. Our server did a decent job. Her visits to our table were brief and it seemed like she was more focusing on her next task at hand than us - continuing that feeling of unwelcome.   Overall I'd say this was pretty average. Decent quality food, but a good selection from a unique menu that attempts to save it. Like I mentioned though, this was our first time and the food alone wasn't enough to get us to come back - so when that was met with disappoint service we left feeling like we were doing them a favor getting out of there (their menu even has a note on it saying to be mindful of how long you sit on Saturdays and Sundays, how crappy is that???) and won't rush back any time soon. They could have made an easy repeat customer, but now I'm looking at it as more of a three-strikes policy after today's visit.   TL;DR - decent food with great choices, awesome atmosphere, but the service staff leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"The food is OK and the service is consistent -- consistently irritating. Why do servers look right at you, see you waving at them, then proceed to lazily wipe a vacant table when no one is waiting, rather than take the orders of the people who are???"}
{"text":"another hidden gem - def need to get ANYTHING with sweet potatoes in it"}
{"text":"I'm continuously surprised this place is still open because every experience I've ever had here has been bad.  Zada Janes likes to think of itself as a trendy organic breakfast place, in the vein of Asheville's Sunny Point Cafe or Early Girl.  But unfortunately it is a poor imitation of those places. The food is always mediocre at best and the service is constantly pretty awful.  The last time I tried eating there, I was with a friend's family of 5 on a weekday around 10, hardly peak hours.  The first food all came out over an hour after we ordered.  The rest all showed up in spurts.  The two adults first, followed by their kids meals 5 minutes or so later, followed by my own food 10 minutes later, followed by two sides of bacon in the initial order that didn't make it until 30 minutes later.  The food isn't memorable; it's standard breakfast fair a notch better than a diner.  Have brunch at Bistro La Bon and avoid this place entirely."}
{"text":"Very good omelets, wonderful biscuits and it's a lot of fun to squirt jam out of a bottle.  Be prepared to be extremely full - southern style heavy cooking with a healthy twist.  Vegetarians and meat lovers can happily eat at the same table."}
{"text":"Sunday is packed here and the wait to be seated is long. Once seated the wait is even longer. Plan on 1 hr 15 min or more to be seated and get your food. We were seated after 30 minutes and waited an additional hour to get our food. It's probably best to eat here during the week. The food is good but I wouldn't say exceptional enough to compensate for the extreme wait. But, hey, the music is good!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Where else can you get biscuits with SOYsage gravy?! The food is all fresh; the servers are friendly; the atmosphere is casual and kitschy. Great home made bloody Mary. Tofu scramble is amazing:) Salads are always fresh and the homemade dressings delicious."}
{"text":"I have been to Zada Jane's a few times, and I am going to have to agree with everyone else. The food is great. The price and service are both horrible. Best thing about the place is their Brunch. Parking sucks, too."}
{"text":"Zada Jane's, Mary Jane, it's all the same! This ish good. A perfect recovery from a long night or a swell spot for a breakfast meetup. Zada Jane's will make you appreciate breakfast like you never have before"}
{"text":"This place is great! Their food is delicious, reasonably priced and different. The only complaint I have is the size of the place. It can be very difficult to get in for breakfast/brunch on Saturday or Sunday and it's one of the best."}
{"text":"There is something to be said for restaurants that offer both beer and eggs. The Bunny Rancheros is just one of the awesome items on a menu that looks different than your average brunch establishment. Central Avenue is the perfect location for this expressive establishment."}
{"text":"When a discussion about food allergy friendly breakfast establishments was started one of our Parents Of Allergic Kids members said:   \"We eat at zada Jane's all the time. My TN, PN son eats eggs , grits , biscuit and sausage. We have been eating their for about 8 years.\"  It is always wonderful to find restaurants that takes food allergies seriously. Thank you from PAK!"}
{"text":"I cant say i've ever had a bad experience as far as the food is concerned. The food is worth the wait however the service is lacking and the place itself seems to be trying a bit too hard to \"fit in\" with the Plaza/Midwood vibe."}
{"text":"If everything was half the price I'd give Zada Jane's a 4.5 but $15 for a (just) decent breakfast and coffee coffee isn't something I can recommend. In all fairness there are very few breakfast places I've ever been that I would go to by myself and not socially. Atmosphere is decent. Waitresses are not particularly attentive but don't ignore you either."}
{"text":"My lowly one star is based on (lack of) service only. Both times I've been to Zada Jane's (breakfast seated at the bar) I've had really poor service but really GREAT food.   So I'll focus on the service, since I'm confident you'll be happy with the food.   Be prepared for long intervals between touch points. It took the bartender over five minutes to greet me. Then after receiving my glass of water, I had to flag her down to remind her about my MIA coffee. By the time I finally received my food, I'd been seated more than an hour. (Thankfully I'd brought a book)   I noticed the same lack of follow through with other patrons--some of whom waited more than ten minutes to be greeted.   The incoming phone calls seemed to be a real curve ball as well. Several times throughout my last visit, there were instances when the ringing phone took precedence over the customer in the midst of placing her order. That just seems backwards to me.   Get it together, ZJ!"}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast or lunch. Breakfast, coffee, cocktails how can you go wrong. The place gets packed on the weekends, but well worth the wait. Friendly staff and good food. Plus the bartender is hot."}
{"text":"Great food!  Meats and veggies are organic and local.  Atmosphere is fun and bright.  Nice outdoor patio with cornhole. I love it, you going to love it!"}
{"text":"Been here tons of times. Food was good, but in a 30 minute estimated wait they sat 3 groups of the same size before us that arrived well after. Our wait ended up being over an hour and when I politely asked when we would be seated I was told it would be soon. The host proceeded to seat the next group that arrived before us. The only explanation that could be had is either the host knew the other groups or prioritized against a group of color like ours."}
{"text":"We got there at the perfect time (9), before the brunch crowd. Parking was easy. No wait for a table or service. While ordering, the waiter helped explain menu options so I wasn't paying more than I should. Food came out in good time and was yummy! Loved the options available for grain-free, dairy-free eating (and those sweet potatoes were amazing). Fun atmosphere. I would love to go again! (The only negative I have is it was a bit pricey for breakfast foods. My plate + coffee + tip was $15.)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were searching for a veggie friendly restaurant in the Charlotte area. We came across Zadas and we're stoked to try it out. We waited about thirty minutes to be seated and then waited an additional 45 minutes for one omelette, a pancake, a salad, and biscuits & gravy. When we got the food, we we're missing the pancake. The waitress, Rachel P, must of forgot to ring in the pancake and so we waited an additional 15 min for ONE pancake. The food was OK. The pancake was nearly $3 and was the size of a sand dollar! Definitely not a place I would suggest to ANYBODY, especially if you expect good customer service. I am being nice and giving them 2 stars because you could tell that the concept was great, but without solid customer service and a time-efficient process, you will fail every time."}
{"text":"how the heck does this place stay in business, the food is fine but not great...but the service is just god awful...takes for ever to get your food and if you see your server more than twice (when they take your order and when they bring your food ) consider it Christmas.  With so many great servers in Plaza-Midwood needing work or extra shifts seems like you can find some strong servers.  The three things that make a restaurant great. Quality, Cleanliness and service. Notice what's missing there price. Because within reason people will pay if a place has these three things.....Well guess which on Zada James is missing..."}
{"text":"Jodie makes The Absolute BEST soy chai latte in town!!"}
{"text":"I've done lunch here before and it has been great with the unique menu. Always fresh ideas and ingredients. We just tried Zada's for dinner and it was awesome! The nachos were not typical cheese sloppy bar food nachos. They were super fresh and had a good balance between chips, cheese and others. We tried the filet mignon w/ mash taters. It was the best one I have ever had since it was cooked to the right temp, seasoned properly and had a great sear. Beats the $40 version from one of the fancy steak joints on Tyron. Perfect! Wish I lived closer"}
{"text":"It's a great place to start your day. Breakfast served all day, tasty appetizers, and great salads.  I really enjoy zada jane's, and I eat there regularly. The food is great for the price, and the staff is really friendly. But I can't give them 5 stars because inconsistency.  Regardless of how busy they are, some days it takes forever to get your food. And some times the food isn't up to par. But the staff is always willing to help and make up    Try the Bunny Rancheros, a salad, or one of their breakfast burritos.  The bar at Zada's is the perfect spot for a quick solo meal. Beer and coffee are always available.  for it.  If you are in Plaza Midwood, check it out. It's worth the stop."}
{"text":"I loved this little spot, very cozy, eclectic located in Plaza Midwood.  Be prepared to wait for a table, who cares, pour yourself a cup of coffee, read the NY Times/Observer and chill.  Nice menu, excellent \"fluffy\" biscuits, and excellnt coffee, which is key.."}
{"text":"Bfast, brunch, dinner... It's always great!  Hours.. Sometimes suck thought.  Weekends they seem to close when they feel like it.. /:"}
{"text":"Its not the same anymore with Roger. Its Roger's menu and name. You would walk in and get the friendliest greetings. Its simply not the same anymore.   The service is ok. The food is great but definitely overpriced. Unfortunately, its lost its charm that exemplified the Plaza Midwood neighborhood."}
{"text":"We visited Zada Jane's Sunday, July 26, 2015 after working up an appetite from visiting the local antique shops and Reggae Central. I had the Kool Kips Nachos sans guacamole and pico de gallo with chicken added. When I read that the nachos had zucchini in them, it gave me pause. I like zucchini, but I've never even conceived that anyone would put it in nachos. I like spicy so I added some Sriracha sauce to mines. The nachos were delicious. I will definitely be back for some more. We ate outside on the patio since it was a nice day out. My guy had the Portobello mushroom sandwich with the garlic potatoes on the side. He said it was delicious.  The wait service could have been better, hence the three stars. She seated us and said she would be back with the menus. By the time I had gone to the restroom and returned we did not have our menus so we had to go find her so was could get menus to order our food."}
{"text":"Super rude wait staff. Got seated after 20 mins (they weren't that crowded - plenty of empty tables) only to have another server come out and yell at me from another table that they won't serve outside. Told her I was seated by another server and she made a face and walked away.  Whattttt?? Walked across the street and got some pizza with no attitude."}
{"text":"A funky Lil cafe with amazing breakfast. I had the Brooklyn hasher, a yummy frittata with pork sausage smothered in cheese with sweet potato hash underneath. So yummy! The staff was so sweet and friendly :)"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Zada Janes, my new years resolution was to eat at a new restaurant every week that I'd never been to. This is my starting point, one review down 51 left to go.   My steak sandwich was cooked quite well, and piled full of tender pieces of steak. Unfortunately the same can't be said for my friends food. Both got sandwiches and one side each, small portions all around except mine. I felt many of the options were a little pricy, but that could just be me.  My waitress was very awesome, she even checked on the name of a song that was playing for a friend of mine.  Yeah the inside is \"funky\" and \"creative\" so is Fuel down the street, and most other places in plaza midwood. So that alone wouldn't be enough to draw me in. Final verdict. My meal was filling, but then again I believe they used a whole cow for mine.  We had to stop at McDonald's for one of the group because of such small serving sizes. So chances are it was a one stop place"}
{"text":"I was once an avid supporter of the deliciousness that was being concocted at Zada Janes. But after today I'm sorry I will not be returning. In a laid back atmosphere I am okay with a laid back service style. Today was beyond laid back to the point of lazy and down right nonexistent.   The kicker. A friend specifically ordered gluten free pancakes. Having a gluten allergy this seemed to be a no brainer. Half way through the meal the server let's us know that the pancakes are not the gluten free ones and asks. \"Do you still want them?\" Then proceeds to tell us that someone else can have the rest of her half eaten ones since she wasn't going to finish them. WHAT?! So after a trip to CVS and $20 in medication we will not be returning again. Sorry Zada. This failure can't be recovered from."}
{"text":"So I am a little shocked that it has taken me this long to write a review for Zada's but better late than never right?  I live probably a good 1.2 miles from this trendy establishment and thank God for it.  I have tried a few breakfast/brunch joints in Charlotte and I have to say that I appreciate the lack of pretensiousness that Zada's offers amongst the slew of other \"brunch\" destinations.    My current favorite is the Blazing Saddles Omelet...a juevo caccoon of delicious chipotle chicken, black beans and jalepenos mixed with mouth watering pico de gallo and topped with a generous dollop of sour cream.  A few other favorites are the Bunny Rancheros (similar tex mex flavor sans omelet style), the Booker T's East Side Hasher and the Belveder (for a healthier option).  I ALWAYS opt for the roasted sweet potatoes and  homemade biscuits (...when in the South)  and slather a generous helping of their homemade berry jam a top for a healthy touch, HA!    For the java fans, you can feed your caffeine fix while you wait (probably a while... at least on Sunday) for a table.  There are plenty of quirky nostalgic mugs to pick from and a piping pot of coffee available while you wait... either outside--enjoying the sunshine, shuffleboard and cornhole games, and Central Ave traffic or eyeing the plates of patrons inside, chatting with the sweet, curly haired bartender as she concocts a delicious bloody mary, or trying to decipher the indoor wall art... this can take a while.    And one more thing worthy of note, this breakfast bistro is pet friendly... outdoors that is.  Don't be surprised if your waitress brings over a bowl of water and a treat for your furry friend as you dine in the daylight.    Delicious breakfast food, coffee for days, outside games, and the pooches approve?!  Next time you ponder, where to go for brunch... Zada's should clearly be your answer."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see so many good reviews of this place.   Bottom Line: The service was SO TERRIBLE I can't even remember what my brunch tasted like.    I have been in the service industry for several years so I am typically very understanding. It was so bad I signed up for yelp just to write this review (my first ever).   A few highlights (other than our server just being slow, indifferent and surly in general) :  My friend's water came after she received her entree, After several minutes of our waitresses absence I finally went inside to the bar to order a cocktail where a bunch of the waitstaff was just hanging out, we waited 20 MINUTES for our checks.   I will never go back."}
{"text":"Typical Saturday visit so we expected a long wait and were right on (30 minute wait for a party of 3).   That did not bother us at all since the weather outside was so nice.  We ordered a custom omelette, the sweet potato hash and the goat cheese omelette.  Sadly food took 40 minutes to get there.  Waitress forgot the drink order and never brought a coffee.  Was not overly impressed with the custom omelette, it was truly just ok.    There are better places to go to in Charlotte for brunch."}
{"text":"Sweet tea, good company and awesome vibes at Zada Jane's.  Time to plan my next trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"There's a lot to love about Zada Jane's.  The sweetness-and-light decor, the localish menu, the fact they generally have someone who knows something about coffee manning the cappuccino machine.  The jelly comes in a squeeze bottle from 'Imladris Farms'.  Elves make their jelly, it's true.  The food always sounds fantastic on the menu, letting you know which co-op produced which animal you're about to devour-and it's impossible to deny that the local-food and slow-food snobs .. er .. aficionados eat that stuff up.  Especially, in this case, the slow-food folks.  They should have nothing at all to complain about, because this chow creeps along as if they're out killing the pig by the dumpster.  Let's talk about hipsters for a minute, shall we?  There are hipsters for every category; most of us are familiar with the 'scene hipster', overly conscious about trends, which bars are the dive-y-ist, they like bands you've never heard of.  These are not the only stripe of hipster.  Enter the 'foodie hipster'.  They know all these great local places you've never heard of, they refuse to eat at chain restaurants because they want to support the local community, they want gluten-free organic farm-raised low-fat cuisine with a vegetarian option.  They watch Iron Chef and feel bad that they like foi gras, but it's just so delicious.  Zada Janes is the foodie hipster scene in exactly the same way that any given late-night diner belongs to the scenester.  It hits all their buttons; they don't care how long they have to wait or how terrible the service is or how inconsistent the food quality is, because it's local and neighborly and they get to know the name of the pig.  If you find yourself watching 'Chopped' or reading about 'sustainable farming' despite never setting foot on freshly tilled soil, you will absolutely ADORE Zada Jane's.  For the rest of us, here's the actual review:  The food is usually good, but can be inconsistent.  The service is universally terrible, and the service staff will give you the impression that they're on the morning shift because they're still awake, still drunk, and plan on sleeping it off after 5pm.    Your order is like as not to be wrong, and while you're waiting for the correction (or even a drink refill) you can write the Great American Novel.  It's a hip brunch spot, so either get in before 10am, or be prepared to fight a horde of noisy children for the shuffleboard and cornhole out front.    If you plan on getting coffee while you wait the gentle eternity it will take to get you seated, bring a mug.  The line is often 30 people, and there are maybe a dozen mugs to go around.  The seating is cramped, many of the tables are tiny, and you are like to be jostled.  Any suggestion on the done-ness of your eggs might as well be a prayer to Odin.  All that said: if you can get there at an off-peak time, don't mind paying a premium price for knowing where your grits were grown, and are fine with hanging around for a couple of hours, there's a good chance you'll have an acceptable dining experience."}
{"text":"Ohhhh Zada.... Zada JANE. Upon arriving to Zada Janes Corner Cafe, at 11:30am, I met my friends and proceeded to wait for a table. Upon waiting, I realized just how packed the place really was, and that was only outside! We stood and waited for almost a half hour before we found a seat.... that is, a seat to wait even longer. Regardless, we finally got a table inside (which was even more packed than outside was) and yay! It was a booth!  My friends and I ordered a round of momosa's (yes, they ID'd us) and looked over the menu. Zada Janes has a great food selection, though I couldn't seem to find the drink selections, but I was excited to try their food! I've heard many great things about their food and was not at all disappointed. I had the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich with a side of potato spuds and devoured the entire thing! The wait staff was friendly and fairly prompt while serving the drinks and food. $5 dollar momosa's on Sundays, by the way.  Overall, I loved the place. Very unique with a lot of personality, but it seems to be busy the majority of the week and that can downplay the atmosphere a bit. Also, we were seated in a booth with a draft, so we were pretty cold the entire time, but that wasn't at all the Cafe's fault.   I LOVED Zada Janes and will definitely go back as soon as I get a chance. YAY!"}
{"text":"I had heard this place was really popular for brunch, and that is really an underestimate. It's jam packed! We got there at 9:30 on a Sunday and literally by seconds beat the massive crowd.   We ended up getting a table after about 10 minutes, but the food took about 40, which was definitely disappointing. However, I really loved the funky atmosphere with different mugs and knick knacks--see if you can find the spaceman next time you are there!   The food was really great as well. Since I live in Boston now, I was craving a biscuit and it was super delicious! I took bites of most of the food people at my table was eating. I enjoyed my omelet, the pancakes, the potatoes and of course that biscuit.   If you plan on going on a Sunday, I would get there early, or come when you aren't so hungry. Waiting with all that yummy food around is torture!"}
{"text":"I ate there once a few years ago and was unimpressed.  I thought the food was mediocre and rather expensive."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Zada Jane's twice in the past couple of weeks but sadly, enjoyed my first visit more than my second.   On my first visit, I ordered the Bunny Rancheros and would have eaten the entire plate but did not for fear that my stomach would explode. It was absolutely delicious. Every element of the dish was perfect and would keep me coming back indefinitely.   As I am contemplating my second trip, I am puzzled as to why I chose to deviate from the Bunny Rancheros but I suppose it makes me a more educated reviewer of the restuarant. I decided to order the East Side Hasher while my boyfriend ordered the Rancheros at my urging. The Hasher was O.K. but really nothing special. The eggs were a bit overcooked and it was lacking seasoning but the sausage was in huge, delicious chunks and the sweet potatoes were amazing.   Overall, I really like the atmosphere and the food at Zada Janes. There are vegan and vegetarian options all over the menu and they even have a full bar! The menu is very small but breakfast is served all day so it gives you a few more options than the lunch or dinner fare. The service is good, the restaurant is cute, and the ingredients are fresh so I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Really solid, funky cafe.  Was won over by the service, decent coffee, and really high quality pork sausage.  Would be my regular breakfast/brunch place if I lived here.  Would definitely try lunch and dinner as well (at a glance, wine list promises good value)"}
{"text":"Nice staff. Good location and setting. My man in the kitchen needs to work on his quality control....cold sausage was delivered to the table...."}
{"text":"I'm new to town but have been here several times. My fav spot in Charlotte for Brunch. You may have to wait a bit as it gets busy on Saturdays & Sundays. If there's a spot at the bar go ahead and grab it - its first come, first serve - and the curly-headed female bartender gives excellent service.  I always get the Belvedere omelet with grits and a biscuit - delicious. Also, the best Bloody Mary I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch.  Large portions, unique atmosphere, fast and friendly service.  Will eat there again!,!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite brunch spot in Charlotte, but I'll never go there again after Sunday. We knew mother's day meant it would be packed, but we were told a 35 minute wait which seemed reasonable. We noticed open seats at the bar but were told those seats were treated like tables and were off limits.  After 50 minutes there were still 4 people ahead of us on the list. Bar seats remained open, but hey, those are off limits. We pointed out that we had been waiting over an hour. 2 minutes after we were told this, another couple came in to ask how long the wait was. The hostess told them 35 minutes. What?!?  We finally asked about the (still) empty bar seats. This time we were told sure you can sit there right now! Had we NOT done this, I'm  certain we would have waited another half hour. We ordered at the same time as 2 other parties. Now crowning 2 hours there with no food, we watched one of those couples order, eat, pay their check. And the other group had ordered, ate, ordered more, ate........and we still didn't have food. The food finally came after asking twice about it. If I wasn't dying of starvation, I would have told them to keep it.  And not one person ever apologized. I don't have a problem with an hour or so wait if I'm told an hour. Another diner said she waited 2 hours because she had a common last name and the hostess gave the table that was intended for them to another party. party. I suggest Zada Jane's get a wait system a little more sophisticated than writing names on the back of an envelope.  I'm really sad because I used to looooove this place. But they've lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Zada Jane's. We got in right before the breakfast rush on a Saturday morning. We sat at the bar and had the best coffee with honey.   I don't remember the name of what I ordered was but it was a cheese covered mound of sweet potato homefries, covered with local sausage, eggs and cheese. It was to die for.   Very unique menu, nice atmosphere, good service. Can't wait to go back! They were making a good looking Bloody Mary breakfast cocktail that I will have to order next time."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is ridiculously slow. Expect to wait for a table, then wait even longer for your food. This used to be a great place to grab brunch but having to wait over an hour for ordinary food has lost its appeal."}
{"text":"Zada Jane's is amazing!!!  Some friends and I came in for breakfast and I had the pancakes, which were the best I have ever had!  The place has a homey feel and the staff was very accommodating. We came back to try Chef Donnie Simmons new dinner menu and I must say that that was the best meal that I have had here in Charlotte. The menu looks so good I had trouble deciding what I wanted!  The food is so incredible that I want to come back every night for dinner!  Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Why are there so many so-so reviews of this place?  It's a neighborhood gem, not to mention all of the healthy and sometimes-organic food they offer.  The only complaint I have is that the wait times for seating and for food are a bit long.. but that's to be expected if you choose to brunch on Sundays at a super busy (and small) restaurant when everyone else in Plaza Midwood rolled out of bed and had the same idea.  Outdoor seating is also a plus; they allow me to bring my puppy (and baby).    Overall, Zada Jane's is a fav.  For sure."}
{"text":"Three hours of my life I'll never get back.  I understand the long wait to get a table.  What I don't understand is how a popular brunch spot can be so poorly managed on what has to be its most important day of the week. - Sunday.  Food took over an hour to get to our table.  No biscuits.  Espresso machine down.  Food is good but won't go back ever again."}
{"text":"My go-to restaurant for brunch, lunch, dinner... Anything! Bunny rancheros are my fave. Just wish they were open for diner every nigh!"}
{"text":"Go in expecting to wait.  Our wait time ended up being doubled what we were told and it takes a long while for your food arrive as well.  I saw in other reviews they experienced the same thing, its like if they told you it was a hour wait then they know you would leave, so they tell you 30-40 min, thinking it wont be so bad.  I felt like I saw more people waiting for their food than actually eating it therefore making the table turnaround extremely slow.  But the food is amazing once it makes it to your table but be careful as they will also up-charge you for certain sides, even though it makes it seem like a side is included with your entree.  Parking is not as bad as other reviews have made it out to be, yes their parking lot is small but there are walk-able lots nearby.  Also love the use of different kinda of coffee mugs, cute place. Next time I go back I will make sure I have the whole afternoon available..."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but will never go back after a number of disappointing visits.  You never can get parking, that is true.  Our most recent visit, when we got there with our 18 mth old they told us there was one couple ahead of us.  Ok, well if the hostess was doing her job she would have said 'its going to be a long wait because a long wait because we can only seat you at 2-3 tables and those tables were just seated'.   Seeing we have a toddler she would recognize this as important information! Instead we watched about 10-12 groups that arrived after us get seated and 45 mins later had a table.  The waitress acting like we were just a burden to even have to stop by our table.  Our food was stone cold when we got it about 20mins after ordering.  My husbands meal was grossly cold, 2 eggs over easy w turkey bacon and a biscuit was $7.95.   We were there for 1 hr and 50mins to get a nasty cold breakfast.   And its not a cheap breakfast stop for 4.5 people.  Regardless, my son was a saint, never complained or made noise, no messes.  The service and food has gotten worse over my last visits and now I am not going back though I use to go a few times a week since I live right in walking distance."}
{"text":"We waited almost an hour to get seated and, once we were, it took another hour to get our food. When the food got here, it was kinda cold. Just not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday with my husband around 3pm for a super late lunch....though we stuck with breakfast options, since they serve breakfast all day!  Since it was so nice outside, we chose to sit at a table on their side patio. Also, since it was 3pm, it wasn't that crowded.....though, past experiences walking by this place around brunch time is that it seems to get crazy busy.  I ordered a mimosa and my husband ordered a beer. There draft selection isn't that great but the two that they had on draft were local. The mimosa was a perfect mix of OJ and Champagne...aka, heavy on the champagne!  We decided to split something, since all the food coming out looked like huge portions. We ordered the Huevos Rancheros with the Chipotle Chicken. Holy, amazing flavor! I mean this dish was so tasty.....chicken, potatos, ranchero sauce, queso sauce, black beans, all with 2 eggs on top. Man, my mouth is just watering thinking about that sauce on it! It came with two tortilla shells....though, with the portion size, 2 wasn't really enough. However, I would actually recommend this dish sans-tortilla anyways. The portion was HUGE. We kept talking about how we have zero clue how many people could eat this by themselves. I felt overly full with just a half a portion! Totally recommend this!  My husband also ordered two pancakes (no clue how we actually ate them though....bottomless pit). I had a bite of them. They were very good, nothing out of this world, but very good. I think they added some spice to them that gave them an extra little something.   Just a note, in the 30 minutes that we ordered, got, and ate our meal, like over 5 orderes of nachos came out (for different tables). We kept saying how we must have missed the memo on ordering nachos....if that many people get them, they must be pretty good. Huge looking serving in a bowl with guac. Will try next time!"}
{"text":"i've visited z.j.'s several times and its usually on saturday's.... it's usually super crowded until late afternoon. i love the organic menu items. sweet potato hashbrowns on the booker t, bisquits and the delicious homemade jam. the service is always spotty at best. i have had a couple bad service moments i.e. the waitress told my friend and i to hurry up because others were waiting for tables. RUDE! but i returned b/c  i love the food and the cool, crunchy people that visit. occasionally i happen upon a great service experience... but that doesn't happen the majority of the time."}
{"text":"We had a late dinner on fri night and the restaurant was pretty quiet. Delicious food and really friendly waitress. We were in and out quickly and loved the meal. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The veggie nachos @ Zada Janes are amazing.  There is also a good brunch (no alcohol, though) and wide selection of veggie options.  My advice?  Get there early, especially for brunch."}
{"text":"Really delicious for breakfast.  Haven't had lunch their yet, but this place is great.  Love the patio and I love that you can bring your pooch."}
{"text":"Love the Veggie Nachos, Breakfast Salad and the Bunny Rancheros.  Of course also great is the fact that we frequently walk to this joint.  The wait can be a drag but people watching will help to entertain.  Prefer sitting outside when weather is nice.  Service is hit or miss but seems to have improved over the last year.  For us, typically a breakfast/brunch place."}
{"text":"I enjoy the hip decor at Zada Jane's. Local photography and art on the walls, local meat in the food and a nice bar in the center.   If you're going here for one meal and one meal only, make it breakfast. Especially if the weather's nice and you can sit on the patio. If it's a weekend, expect a crowd and perhaps a wait, but you can always play shuffleboard until you get a table.   Sure the huevos rancheros aren't entirely authentic, but they're still great. I like the sweet potato hashbrowns, french toast and pancakes. The chorizo and sausage they use is delicious (from Grateful Growers, I believe).   Dinner entrees are pricey, unfortunately. As others have mentioned, salads and sandwiches are more budget friendly. Though, during restaurant week a couple of years ago my then-boyfriend and I had an amazing dinner. Perfectly executed pork belly and ahi tuna dishes. But, as you can tell, I usually stick to breakfast or brunch. :)"}
{"text":"I've been to this cafe a few times and have always received great service and food. Only had their breakfast, but it has always been very good. I would definitely suggest this place to anyone looking for good meal."}
{"text":"Wish i could give zero stars to this place. Took over an hour to get our order and frankly iHop would have been a better option. We ordered the kofta veggie burger and pancakes and the food was just horrible. I wanted to try this place coz of all the good reviews but it was very disappointing to say the least. You can visit the place if you want to waste en eternity over the worst food of your life. Would never ever want to come back here!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice, and I regret both times. The food was exceedingly mediocre, the portions unsatisfying, and the service was unreasonably slow. The last time I went, I waited 45 minutes for a small, cold, bland bowl of nachos. The location is the only thing this place has going for it, which is not enough for me to go back. Do yourself a favor and walk down to Dish or Mama's Caribbean Grill."}
{"text":"I love Zada Jane's food and eat there at least once week. But this morning was such an unpleasant encounter that I'll never return. I sat myself at the bar which was apparently a mortal sin because the hostess was so incredibly rude to me. She rudely said to me \"Do NOT seat yourself.\"  Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't automatically realize this is literally the only bar in existence that isn't first-come first-serve (I'm a bartender myself). I'm fine with the hostess telling me how it works, but it was the humiliating and degrading way in which I was told that is prompting me to leave this bad review. I work in the hospitality industry and this was one of the most inhospitable treatments I've ever seen or experienced personally.  I was planning on taking friends there tomorrow morning for brunch but we'll be going elsewhere."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to one of our favorite neighborhoods in Charlotte, Plaza Midwood, and to Zada Jane's Corner Café. This beachfront themed café advertises a menu that is half vegetarian and half meat. Although breakfast is their focus and served all day, their lunch menu includes sandwiches, salads, and many unique sides, and their dinner menu is full of delicious options.  Dora here. This place has been on our list since we visited The Workman's Friend directly across the street and gawked at the crowded patio. Today was no different. The place was jammed with a thirty-minute wait. Service was friendly and attentive and more than welcoming, even if we were among the oldest ones there.  For my lunch, I chose the South of NO North omelet, which included country ham, caramelized onions, green chilies, cheddar cheese and covered with homemade salsa and served with a side of stone ground grits and a homemade TLC biscuit. This omelet was great and worked together perfectly with the onions and chilies to bring this dish to the next level. The salsa added a little heat, and when combined with the grits, made a wonderful bite.  Dora here. The Vegless Avenger, an omelet packed with meats (bacon, country ham, turkey sausage, chipotle chicken and chorizo) along with a healthy dose of cheddar cheese popped with flavor. The egg was light yet held up to all five meats. Typically I'm not a meat-lover when it comes to omelets or pizzas, but the chipotle chicken and chorizo combination intrigued me. One bite led to two and three, and don't you know I ate that whole thing! And the biscuit with apple butter, oh my goodness! I'm trying to cut back on all these carbs, but that biscuit made it tough. The sweet potato hash didn't do much for me. Probably because I prefer my sweet taters loaded with butter and brown sugar. lol.  Still Dora. Fair warning. The inside of Zada Jane's is extremely LOUD. Don't go there expecting to enjoy a quiet morning coffee. Not gonna happen. Not even outside. lol. Also, for parking, they have a small lot behind the restaurant, but don't bother. There's ample parking in a lot kitty corner across the street. You can thank us later. What's your favorite omelet?  We rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"Called beforehand and was told there wouldn't be a wait at 10:30am (on Saturday) - arrived at 10:30am and waited about 30 minutes. However we did have a party of 7.5 so the wait was understandable. There was not a whole lot of space to stand and we were somewhat rudely asked to move more than a couple times, not the most pleasant waitresses. Foodwise: I ordered the biscuit, happy egg with cheese and a side of French toast. I was a little surprised at the length of time it took until we were able to order our food (it was busy at the restaurant but not THAT busy). Eggs were delicious, biscuit with homemade raspberry jam was stellar. I was however disappointed with the French toast, the toast was great but the menu indicated a slice of French toast and apparently that actually translates to a half a slice of French toast... My friends really enjoyed the breakfast sandwich, the bunny rancheros, the basic breakfast and the pancakes - not the sweet potatoes. Unfortunately, we were charged for the coffee we were offered while we waited that they said was complimentary."}
{"text":"Came here to meet a couple friends and the waitress was very quick to put together two tables and umbrella's to block the sun. She was fantastic and friendly. Parking can be tricky, so I parked across the street in the lot, but sometimes it's full and I wouldn't have known where else to park in that case. One friend had an omelette and salad and enjoyed it, while the rest of my friends had dessert. Carrot cake and pistachio bread pudding was what they had the day we came. I tried the carrot cake and it was my favorite carrot cake I've had. I do not like carrot cake because it's always either too dry or too sweet, but this one was really good and didn't have big chunks of walnuts like others I've tried. It tasted so fresh and was the perfect constancy. Their coffee and latte's are also really good, served in a cute home-y mug. I like the outdoor patio and the neighborhood vibe."}
{"text":"There is nothing like moving across a city to help you discover places you should have been going since the re-location.  Zada Jane's was exactly that for me on this past rainy Saturday afternoon.  My bf and I stopped in, were promptly seated, and soon I consumed one of those meals that you swear you would eat again three hours later, in its entirety.  The Bunny Racheros....where, oh where, have you been all my life?!?!  I am a huevos rancheros fan anyway and this one takes it to a whole 'nother level, seriously.  Black beans, fried eggs, pepper jack cheese sauce, cilantro crema, turkey sausage....I'm salivating just thinking about it.  It was so, so good!  My boyfriend had a \"vegless avenger\" omelet, which to me is gross due to the excessive amount of meat, but he said it was \"okay\" but he would not order it again.  Take from that what you will.  The biscuits were as promised....fluffy and full of TLC.  I also had an enormous vanilla latte which was damn near perfect.  I can see how this place could get crowded, and no, our service wasn't the fastest, but for a chill Saturday, it was perfect.  I imagine this will be our weekly stop from now on.  As Kevin put it, \"Pancake House who??\""}
{"text":"Finally came to Zada Jane's for dinner, as opposed to my normal obsession with their breakfast food. My fiancee and I have used 2 Groupons in the past year here, woohoo for coupons!   My first dinner venture was the Roasted Wild Mushroom Ravioli. I would probably give it 3.5/5 starts. Really good and tasty, but nothing special.  My second dinner visit I chose the The No-Da Salad. This will be what I order like, basically every time in the future. As a vegetarian it's hard to find a hearty salad with lots of protein and this salad goes above and beyond. The base is a spring mix with baked marinated tofu, tomatoes, hard boiled egg, artichoke hearts, avocado, roasted corn, white cheddar cheese, sunflower seeds, sprouts. Ahhh! Amazing!   My fiancee ordered the Ashley Farms Free Range Chicken entree. Other than his usual love, the Belvedere, this is currently his favorite thing he's ordered. It comes with a side of smashed potatoes and green bean casserole.   Oh, I almost forgot, on our last visit we ordered the Nachos as an appetizer. These were a little different than your normal nachos because they're served in a bowl, rather than a plate. Of course I love that they're vegetarian. The queso is what's up though. Mmmm! These black tortilla chips are also piled with grilled veggies, black beans, guacamole, romaine lettuce, sour cream, corn, and salsa. Will definitely order again.  The service this last time was great. The owner even came over and chit chatted a while. This is not always the case. I'd say, 1/3 of the time we get unlucky and get bad service. But luckily this isn't always and the food makes me forgive."}
{"text":"The food had a nice flavor to it. And I enjoy the fact that they serve breakfast all day. On the negative side of things; the wait to be sat was way too long. The server was mediocre at best and the food was cold by the time that it got to us!"}
{"text":"Vegans rejoice - Zada Janes has a great tofu scramble, along with traditional brunch options (i.e., meat). You can finally sip mimosas again with your omnivore friends! The scramble is delicious and innovative with Indian curry - not too spicy and definitely not your run-of-the-mill scramble. I docked the rating a star, however, because their regular menu leaves a lot to be desired for vegans."}
{"text":"I try to write exclusively positive reviews, but -   On one occasion, I waited over an hour to sit. On another, I ordered food and waited an hour, and left without a manager or waiter addressing the unusually long wait. The food doesn't exactly make up for it.    Dish,  down the street,  does breakfast on Saturdays.  Food's better,  service is excellent,  and it's less expensive."}
{"text":"I've only ever gotten the omelets here, they're hit or miss and can get pretty pricey if you build your own. But their chai tea latte is to die for."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!!! Definitely a neighborhood gem. I usually went here for breakfast when I lived in Charlotte...great food, very good service and unique/eclectic decor. Usually gets pretty busy on the weekends, but worth the wait!! They have numerous vegetarian options, which is always nice."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre and service is okay, but it took over 40 minutes to food and they were dead. DO not go there!"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Charlotte in 2009, this place was my favorite.  It's still really solid and I'd like to give it 3.5 stars, but 4 is too many because there were a few visits where we had less than ideal waiters.  The food has always been good, it's unique, local and delicious."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review, but am so disappointed with how this restaurant has gone downhill over the years.  We used to love this place but the last several times we have gone there we found the food to be mediocre, and the service to be excessively long.   Not sure what may have changed over the last year or so, but I sure wish it hadn't.  We won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"I love that I could bring my pups here! Had a large, delicious breakfast with my boyfriend one day outside. Not a lot of shade, so it can get hot. Food was really good, but menu is not extensive so not the best for picky eaters since everything is very different. Great place for large groups!"}
{"text":"This quaint cafe absolutely deserves better credit than its current rating. Another understated and quaint spot that seems to be a staple of its neighborhood has both great ambiance with a lively staff and delicious food to back it up (with vegetarian vegan and gluten free options as well). While enjoying my brunch I sat at the bar and got talking to the bartender and another staff member (Tabitha and Courtney y'all are the absolute best) and they made me feel loved like a regular right away. Additionally, I got the Bunny Rancheros with chorizo for brunch (with an extra side of queso because treat yo self) and WOW was my stomach happy. If you're looking for a casual, delicious, and welcoming way to start off your day, there is no doubt in my mind this is the spot. Not enough cafes like this exist anymore. So happy to have been able to go while visiting."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed in my first visit to Zada Jane's. It definitely did not live up to the hype everyone makes it out to be. Ever since I moved to Charlotte, several people had told me you have to go to Zada Jane's in Plaza Midwood. It must be more for the name than anything else. We ended up leaving and not even eating there. After waiting 30 minutes for our food (two appetizers and a salad), it was not even worth the wait. We sent the food back and went elsewhere. The salad was wrong and the appetizers were nasty. I don't know what has happened to Zada Jane's, but it looks like there are more bad reviews on here than ever before. Hopefully it will change for the better, but I will certainly not be back to find out."}
{"text":"We went at lunch time, and there weren't too many people sitting inside, and not sure how many were on patio, but since it's not that big, it didn't seem especially crowded either.  Waitress was quick with menus and drink order - and THAT is where it STOPPED!  My husband order the Druther's Clucker sandwich, and I ordered the No-Da salad. Now, my salad comes with baked marinated tofu, but I asked to leave off the tofu and replace with ahi-tuna. Since my salad came with tofu, which is $3.25 if you add it to any other salad, I ASSUMED (my fault!) that I would only be charged the difference between what tofu cost as an add-on and what the ahi-tuna cost as an add-on - which is $5.50. WRONG - we ended up having to pay full $5.50 because manager gave lame excuse that it was \"sushi-grade tuna!\"   Now before we ever got our bill and saw the above mentioned charge - we were already irritated because the WAIT for our food to finally arrive was ridiculous!!!  After we got drinks, we waited for a full 35 mins before that mgr came by and said \"I just checked on your order, your food will be out in \"2 more minutes!\"  Well, 10 mins after that - we STILL had not received our food and I even asked husband if he was ready to just leave when it finally showed up!  My salad wasn't bad, but since it ended being a $14.45 salad - it was nowhere worth that!   My husband said that his sandwich and sweet potato browns were terrible - the chicken was so overcooked, it was tough, dry and like jerky. Also, his said that the sweet potato browns were like left-over sweet potatoes that they tried to make something good out of, and totally failed. We did not have a good first-time experience at all - I can't understand why people seem to like this place."}
{"text":"Today I made my second attempt at Zada Janes. A few month ago a few of us went for brunch but after hearing the wait was over 45 minutes and observing every table without food and only drinks... we decided to leave.   Fast forward to today. We arrived around 10 am on a Saturday and didn't have to wait at all. Yay! I'll be honest... I had very low expectations after reading reviews and my first attempt. I was pleasantly surprised that our waitress was prompt and checked in with us frequently to make sure our drinks were full and food was up to par. The mimosas were the perfect ratio of champagne and orange juice. Big plus. I ordered a classic meal of scrambled eggs, turkey bacon, grits and toast and my friend had the Booker T. Highly recommend you try the grits (SO good) and the Booker T!  This is a very trendy restaurant with beautiful artwork and a fun, chill atmosphere. Parking isn't bad either... just grab a spot in the lot behind the building.  Also, it's a dog friendly place. There were tons of pups out on the patio and it looked like the restaurant may have provided them with water bowls. Love it.   Overall, highly recommend and like others have said... expect a wait (grab a cup of coffee or a mimosa- or two) or just go earlier and you shouldn't have an issue."}
{"text":"I don't think Charlotte has alot of strong options for brunch but Zada Jane's proved me wrong. I checked this place out yesterday for brunch and left with a full belly and happy thoughts. The inside is eclectic and funky with bright colors with knick knacks everywhere and artwork by local artists on the walls. It reminded me of a place I would find in San Francisco or another liberal city and that make me happy. Plus every song that came on was something found on my ipod so good music, bright colors and big brunch menu? Count me in.   I got the Booker T's East Side Hasher. The bottom layer was the sweet potatoes which had a hint of cinnamon, then the sausage (you can get piggy, turkey or soyage!!) topped with eggs, cheese and green onions. I just stared at this when they brought it to me because I wasn't sure on how to conquer this bad boy but I just started from the right and kept on going. The biscuit was fabu as well (not too dry yet not a grease bomb ala Bojangles) and they had a mixed berry jam and apple butter at the table in squirt bottles, which I found charming. I can't wait to go back here again and try one of their savory/sweet dishes for breakfast. I also loved their coffee, strong and they don't have matching coffee cups so you can get a funky cup from their collection or bring your own. I heard that you have to wait forever at this place and that parking can be a pain but I didn't experience that at all. Maybe it was because of the hour change? No clue. We were packed like sardines in there so if you're claustrophobic, this may not be the best option for you. When we left around noon, the outdoor area was packed, I can't wait to go back and play some corn hole while I wait!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Zada Janes after hearing how fantastic it is and all the positive reviews. Unfortunately, I disagree with all of them. The service was terrible to start with, and on of being terrible, when she finally showed up, the server was rude.   The food was mediocre at best; my omelet was mostly oil and my husbands had so much garlic he couldn't eat it. The only saving grace was when the server couldn't figure out how to charge us correctly and gave up, giving us a side for free. Maybe we caught them on an off day? I don't think we will be trying again."}
{"text":"This place is VERY hyped by the Plaza Midwooders and I sort of see it?  Decor: eclectic! spunky! colorful! There's so much to look at.   Wait staff: We had a STELLAR woman helping us out. Very animated, very honest, very attentive. When she checked in after receiving our food, she immediately remarked that my dish was missing something (I was none the wiser) and brought out two sauce options. That said, those I dined with (seasoned Zada Jane goers) said the staff can be hit or miss - so keep that in mind.   Food: Pretty mixed. What I had was not good - a falafel special. I got THREE falafel balls (barely anything) on top of a sparse \"bed\" of sprouts, with 6 wedges of pita to dip in an enormous cup of hummus. Waitress brought me tahini and a delicious lemon aioli for dipping. The dish was just too small and odd. It should be on a bed of lettuce, or within an actual pita if they want to make it a sandwich. Every other dish at the table looked delicious: a custom omelet (it was enormous!), the bunny rancheros, and the valid spinach salad. So I will be trying one of those next time!  Overall: Not thrilled, but I'm definitely going back to try out some different options."}
{"text":"My *last* experience was such a disappointment. Before that, my beau and I were very happy with our past dining experience and dishes, as well as the super cool ambiance. The past Sunday,on top of being sat next to the dirty wooden blinds that trapped two huge flies, my eggs had a blond hair in them - GRODY to the max! No more Zada Jane's for us!"}
{"text":"Came here last Sunday for brunch and I thought it was so cute. There was a little bit of a wait because they closed their outdoor seating area due to weather. Was told that the bloody mary's were really good so I ordered that along with the basic breakfast with over-medium eggs, biscuit, country ham, and sweet potato hash. Everything was delish except for the sweet potatoes they were a bit soggy. I hadn't had a decent biscuit and country ham in a while (I live in Los Angeles but grew up in Northern VA) and it was great. Very cute and fun environment. I recommend for brunch!"}
{"text":"Maybe 2.5 stars actually...Bottom line: as others posted, food is very good most of the time, portions are not big for what they ask u to pay, prices are high, and the wait staff...AHHH the wait staff. I think they suffer from what the \"help\" at Boris & Natachas suffer from: the too-cool-for-the-room aloofness that they try to sell as coolness. Its rare you see grumpier, more put-upon acting servers/help than you do there; if I want ill-acting servers I'll drive to the beach and go to Dicks Last Resort. If DISH started opening for breakfast I bet they'd draw a lot of folks from this place, as at DISH they serve similiar food and most of there folks are great."}
{"text":"I adore this place and come here often, and bring family and new comers here a lot. Trick is to come early as you can to avoid a wait and do not park across the street, the barber over there will tow your car, I've had it happen :( but hey there is a sign so it was my own fault! If you do have to wait it is worth it, the food here is awesome! Portions are great prices are fantastic, coffee is delish and you can have as many cups as you want while waiting. The wait staff are sweet and the bar tender is always quick with your bloody Mary :) If you have the chance to sit outside please try in the summer its worth it and you can play some shuffle board too :)"}
{"text":"Very frustrating management. Had a larger party and was told a 20 minute wait and waited over a hour. Hostess was very rude to us and then tried to sit us at a table that wasn't even wiped down yet. The only good thing was that we got coffee while waiting. Unless you have all day, enjoy being hungry for much longer than expected, and like being treated rudely by employers than this is the place for you. We were treated like an inconvenience and I was told \"I'm not trying to be an asshole but you'd be better off inside.\"  The only saving grace was our waitress who was very apologetic for the behavior of her peers and the food was good. But did not make up for the unpleasantness of the seating. Our party ended up being split and half of us had a great server named Courtney and then the other half were treated so poorly by a waiter who refused to split the checks."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an early Saturday evening dinner here and loved it! I ordered the free-range chicken thinking maybe I should order something else since we make that at home fairly regularly. It's served with mashed potatoes and green bean casserole. I was pleasantly surprised, and reminded that I need cooking lessons, when every bite demanded the full attention of my tastebuds- YUM! My husband enjoyed his shrimp and grits and we both want to return. We've heard about big crowds and long waits here but seeing as though we arrived early, we experienced none of that. I did notice it had begun to pick up by the time we were leaving though.   I was impressed that Zada Jane's is entirely non-smoking. Besides the obvious health benefits to all and kindness to children who might otherwise be subjected to second hand smoke, I think the quality of their food also deserves to be fully tasted.  Excellent area to spend a few hours and walk around before or after dining."}
{"text":"This is such a cute little breakfast cafe. Parking is minimal, but we always get there early on Sunday mornings (Yelp says they open at 9, but I think they actually opened at 8). There's lots of outside and inside seating. I have tried to order different things, but I can't be swayed from the breakfast salad. Something about the combination of crisp spring greens, warm and flavorful potatoes, the savory marinated tofu, and the tangy vinaigrette makes me come back every time. It's filling and flavorful without being too heavy. It gives me an energy boost, doesn't leave me feeling like I need a nap like so many brunch options. My husband loves the Booker T, which is heavier and more indulgent. And the biscuits and jams, mmmmmm. Great service, too!"}
{"text":"While I was visiting my friend she suggested that we go here for breakfast. It was great. I had a burrito, home potatoes, eggs and the best pancake ever. Forget IHop, Waffle House and any other breakfast chain.   Support local."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I was going to complain that there is too much food in some of the dishes.  Then I realized I would be a complete idiot for complaining about it when I eat EVERY SINGLE MORSEL EVERY TIME. Stuffed to the GAWDZ & i'm still eating. This place ROCKS. Go prepared to eat a mess of food because those options are there. Go for it. Oh & try the Chai Latte with almond milk. ORGASMIC on a cool fall day."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place is always busy.  I got the regular breakfast and eggs over medium.  There was no seasoning, everything was bland, and the eggs were runny.  The waitress was often no where to be found and had no personality.  I also listened to the waitresses argue over which sections and tables they had.  I will not be going back.  This was the 2nd time I have been and it was no better than the first.  I will also add, it was close to $30 for extremely bad food.  I actually wished I had gone to a Waffle House was how bad the food tasted."}
{"text":"My wife and I had breakfast at Zada Jane's today after church.  We anticipated that we would have to wait, but were fortunate to get a couple of seats at the counter.  I had tha Amaretto French Toast.  It was delicious and it was accompanied with orange butter.  The combination was wonderful. Also, we had the pleasure of meeting with and being served by Roger.  He is a delightul person and takes good care of you.   Zada Janes offers a great value for themoney with their generous, but not outrageous portions and their moderate prices."}
{"text":"Best little spot for breakfast/brunch (or dinner!) in all of Charlotte. The place has a really cool vibe as others have noted and it's totally trendy. I frequent the place anytime I'm in Charlotte and no disappointment to report. Food is consistently good -- the blazing saddles omelette is my favorite. Overall it's totally worth stopping buy for some great food, friendly service and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was looking for someplace new and fun to take an out-of-town friend for breakfast.  After running a quick search on Yelp, Zada Jane's popped up and it sounded like just what I was looking for.   We went on a chilly morning around 11:00 on a Monday (the MLK Jr. holiday) and it was quite busy.  Thankfully, not busy enough that we couldn't get a table, as I've heard the lines can be horrendous on Sunday mornings.  We were told to sit anywhere.  We sat far away from the door that people kept opening and letting in very cold air.   We were impressed by the menu offerings.  They were different and unique, as well as offering vegetarian options.  My friend and I both went with Booker T's East Side Hasher, which consisted of eggs, sausage (regular, turkey, or soy), and cheese atop sweet potato hashbrowns, served with a crispy biscuit.  Not to get technical, but the \"hashbrowns\" were actually home fries (i.e., cubed fried potatoes vs. shredded).  They not only were made from sweet potatoes, but also tasted like they were coated in a sweet honey.  YUM.  The eggs and biscuits were delicious, too.  Good choice!   And I agree with other reviewers that the coffee was excellent...although I would have liked more.  The service there isn't the fastest, and we didn't see our server that often (hence, only one refill on coffee).  After we finished our meal, another 15-20 minutes was added onto our time waiting for the bill and then paying for it.  Time that another good cup of coffee would have helped pass.    I'm looking forward to going back, but will go when time is not of the essence.  Food = good.  Service = average."}
{"text":"I have dreams of Druther's Cluckers!! The best sandwich on the planet. The roasted potatoes are great but can be hit or miss, meaning dry. But the sandwich always overshadows the occasional dry potatoes. I like the quirky atmosphere and the wait staff. It's just a fun place to go in an awesome part of Charlotte."}
{"text":"Really extensive menu. Great atmosphere. Innovative dishes, was well worth the 30 min wait. Look at their menu on their website!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, one experience was a two star, one was a 3.5 star experience.   First, I came for breakfast, ordered sweet potato hash browns, a biscuit and herb gravy. Everything was brought out save the biscuit, which would be out of the oven soon, I was told. The hash browns were really fried chunks of sweet potato, not quote the expected. By the time the biscuit came, the gravy was cold, and they offered to bring a new cup of gravy. By the time they did that, the biscuit was cold. Very unfortunate, since they were tasty enough.  Second time, I came for dinner. The entree prices were shockingly high, so I never got to try one. I went with a sandwich instead, which was affordable and good, but somewhat bland.   Several people have compared this place to the wonderful, multi-award winning Sunny Point Cafe in Asheville, NC. Yes, it tries to go for the same vibe and eclectic color scheme, has similar menu items and the same berry jam. But other than that, it does not compare one bit."}
{"text":"Yum! If you're like me and like anything sweet potato, you have to try Zada janes. Their sweet potato hash is delicious; they're a little sweet and go great with their breakfast menu. A breakfast menu that includes chorizo as an option for your omelets, might I add.   But not just great for breakfast, their lunch has never disappointed me. Their sandwich options can feed any mood and their breads are always fresh.  The atmosphere, including the patio seating (corn hole included) also makes for an even better Zada experience. While I love the food for a quick bite and the restaurant itself, every time I've been there the service has always been a little lacking. Nothing extreme but my waitress will occasionally disappear for the better part of my meal. That's something that could be addressed but it hasn't stopped me from going back!"}
{"text":"Some friends were in from Atlanta and we stumbled on Zada Janes while looking for a brunch place. We didn't have to wait long and we were able to get a cup of coffee while we waited to sit down. The service was great and our waitress was extremely nice. I've read some reviews that service can be slow, but we didn't have any problems. The food was great (I had the pancakes and cheese grits- yum!) and I can wait to go back and try more of their food."}
{"text":"I found this place by searching for \"Hipster Charlotte\"  on a recent interview trip.  I had a Cheeseburger, some roasted potatoes and a beer for lunch.  I think that hand cut fries would have been better.  I liked the relaxed atmosphere and I will be back here, should I get the job!!"}
{"text":"Stellar breakfast! This place knows how to differentiate. With a menu that is sure to please any hipsters pallet.  Zada Janes goes all in on the local scene - including local art and local product and proteins.  May i suggest the Booker T omelette with turkey sausage and cheddar. The sweetness of the sweet potato, the spiciness of the sausage, and the cheesey delciousness is the best way to start a Saturday morning.  There is typically a line, but enjoy a cup of coffee, sit outside and enjoy the morning."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. It's a unique artsy fartsy place off Central Avenue with a great selection of fresh organic food. I prefer the breakfast fare.  I agree with Kaitlin. This is a neighborhood hangout and most times you'll be waiting 5-20 minutes to be seated. Parking is also a hassle."}
{"text":"Liked this place. There was a wait but we were seated quickly. Service was a little slow for my liking but our server warned us that they are understaffed for the day, can't hold it against them. We both had omelettes and both had he same reaction - not really what we anticipated for an \"omelette\" as the toppings are basically on top of (slightly overdone) eggs instead of mixed in as I would expect. Coffee and potatoes were great. If we come back I'd try something other than an omelette but would definitely give the place another try. Cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"Zada Jane's is my favorite breakfast spot in Charlotte. I usually get the Zada Janer - two eggs cooked any way you like, a protein (i get soysage), a carb (grits - they are great), and either a biscuit or toast (I go with the biscuit). It seems boring, but it is fabulous and plenty filling. They have fun variations on the traditional breakfast, as well. The Bunny Rancheros is a spin on the breakfast burrito, complete with guacamole, and the Booker T's is eggs, cheese, hash browns, etc. all layered into one big dish.   The only downside to Zada Jane's is that on the weekends, there can be a bit of a wait. I usually try to get there before 11, however, if you get there after, it can get up to 45 minutes, especially on Sundays with the church crowd. When it is cool, it is nice to sit outside though, and they have shuffle board and cornhole courts outside, and you can pour yourself a cup of coffee while you wait. In my opinion, Zada Jane's is worth the 45 minute wait."}
{"text":"Very tastey, but a little pricey for dinner.  At least for my cheap budget."}
{"text":"I'd like to start this review off by saying that in no way was my bad experience a reflection of the server.   My boyfriend and I came here on Sunday 11/19/2017 at 1pm.  This was our first visit. I called earlier in the morning to ask if they used latex gloves (I am deathly allergic) the woman answering the phone said they only used nitrile and they can't use latex because she was allergic. I replied thank God! Which, I hope she understand i was thanking God they didn't use latex not for her allergy. It's hard for me to find local places that don't use latex. So i was excited to add Zada Jane's to my list...  We walked passed a busy patio (with two empty tables) and walked into the restaurant to be greeted by a woman who instructed us to sit anywhere we liked. She then grabbed menus and asked if we wanted to sit inside or out. We choose inside because we saw two two-top tables open right away. She walked us to one of the two tops (third from the window) which was dirty. Which doesn't bother me. I understand things get busy. She, paused and said let me clean it for you, turned around and noticed the booth behind her was clean and that we could sit there. This was the second booth from the kitchen. We took that one because we weren't picky and didn't want to make her clean off a table. We were greeted promptly by our server, I wish I would have gotten her name. She got us water and mimosas. We ordered after that, build your own omelette and a side of bacon. We waited about 40 minutes for our food which is understandable for a busy place. During our wait a young woman (slim, with short hair) with four dirty cups stacked in her hand stopped by our table and asked who sat us at this table. Confused, I looked at her said said a woman at the front. She asked if our name was on the list. Still confused because we weren't informed there was a list or a wait, i said no, when we walked in a lady told us to sit anywhere we liked. She asked me again who it was. I told her I had no idea. Which i didn't because  she wasn't our server or the woman behind the bar and I hadn't seen her since. The woman put the dirty cups on our table, spilling the water and then with an attitude stated \"i need to know who because someone did that earlier and fucked up everything for us.\" Walked away and came back to clean up the water she spilled and apologized for spilling it. At this point me and my boyfriend realized they must have been on a long wait. I honestly hope this woman wasn't the manager because I couldn't imagine a Manager speaking to customers like that or placing blame on us for something that had to do with the staff. We personally felt like that was a conversation we didn't need to be included in. And more so we didn't appreciate being accused of skipping a line we had no knowledge of. Both me and my boyfriend are bartenders/servers and would have been more than happy to sit at the bar or wait for a table. But we decided not to make a fuss about it. Our server asked if we wanted another round of mimosas and I told her we would wait for our food. A gentleman stopped by and dropped off our omelettes and explained that the side of bacon I ordered was in the oven and would be out shortly. We got another round of drinks and informed our server that my boyfriends omelette was missing the tomatoes and mushrooms from his omelette. Which wasn't the end of the world--we just didn't want to be charged for it. After we finished our omelettes and drinks the bacon, EXTRA crispy and greasy came out. The gentleman from before dropped it and apologized for the wait. I choose not to eat it and asked for the check. We didn't tell the server that the bacon was near burnt because we honestly just wanted to leave. So we paid for the $3.10 bacon that we didn't eat or get with our meal. As a server I understand food being wrong, going out late, kitchen having an off day, being maybe short staffed, busy on a Sunday for brunch and anything that may come with a bad experience. By no way did we take this out on our server. She was great. And I have had plenty of bad experiences at restaurants but have never wrote a bad review. The events I've described didn't make me write this review. The woman who stopped by our table and confronted us about something we had no control of did. Not because she stopped by the table but because when my boyfriend walked out of the restaurant she rolled her eyes at him in disgust. In all honesty the unprofessionalism this young woman displayed was horrible. None of her problems were our fault. And the only reason i didn't walk back into restaurant and ask to speak to a manager was because I wasn't completely sure she wasn't a manager. The service was great. The food was good even with the missing items. I'm sure on another day the bacon will be great. But the woman who cussed while speaking to us and rolled her eyes as we left is the entire reason we won't patron this place again."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Never had lunch or dinner. Has the character you expect of a Plaza Midwood joint. Great service without an attitude. Super patio for a nice day. Support locally owned businesses! It's good for the economy and encourages others to open and flourish so we can get something besides the big franchise steak houses in our banker town! Good stuff."}
{"text":"A few of my friends are regulars here so I was excited to finally give them a try. We arrived a little after 11am on a Friday morning. Apparently this place is always packed, but when we walked in the place was pretty empty. #win.   We were greeted immediately and got our drinks.I'd checked out the YELP reviews and checked out the menu so I knew what I wanted to get- Blazing Saddles omelet with home fries. I opted for egg whites and the salsa and sour cream on the side.   Cue the waiting music.....  We seriously waited and waited for our food. At one point, I asked our waitress if the order was even going to come out. She said she's check on it but we still waited.   FINALLY.....the food arrived. That goodness it was hot. I was hungry enough to eat my fist I couldn't bear the thought of having to send the whole thing back. The food was fine, nothing to brag about. I could have used a bit more chipotle seasoning on the chicken but otherwise it was just....fine.   If my friends want to go back here again, I'd go but I'm not adding it to my brunch rotation.   Oh...just a head's up....parking is a nightmare. You're welcome! :)"}
{"text":"I love the vibe here and am never disappointed. Check them out for dinner. Lots of good home cooked type meals and its always fresh."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food, the vibe, the staff, the location, the patio, the art, music, 1/2 price bottles of wine on Thurs and Sun - All fab!  I have been to Zada Jane's MANY times.  This is my go to place.   The only thing that holds me back from giving it 5 stars is that often, even though the wait staff are fabulous humans & very friendly, service can be very slow..  If they could just step that up, this would be a 5 star place!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about Zada Jane's, but it took over an hour to get our food.  Once I finally asked the waitress where the food was at, she hcame back and said it was the computers.  Which, from looking at other reviews, seems to be a common issue.  The order was resubmitted, and finally the food came out.  The food was not impressive and certainly not worth an hour and a half.   Once the bill was brought there was no apology or effort to make it right.    I definitely have no interest in coming back, and would recommend others steer clear."}
{"text":"This place was HORRIBLE! I didn't mind the wait because it was super busy and after eating my meal, I don't understand why it was so busy. First of all, the waiter was not helpful at all!! He said it was \"too busy\" to make a substitution to the order (really?) and he couldn't heat our syrup! My fiancée's French toast was dry and tasteless. I ordered the Bunny Rancheros since it seemed to be a popular item, WRONG CHOICE! Needless to say, I will never eat at this place again!"}
{"text":"This place deserves no stars. I ordered a Sunday traditional and they served it with no goat cheese or as a matter of fact with nothing that was supposed to be on it. The plate was also half empty. The food literally looked like it was only supposed to fill half the plate. Additionally, the wait was literally an hour for this. It was the worst dining experience I have ever had. Also the Bloody Mary was disgusting. Highly disappointed. I suggest no one ever comes to this dump."}
{"text":"Great, great place for breakfast!   Zada Jane's has some of the best biscuits in Charlotte!  The jellys they serve with them are made locally in Asheville.  The omelets are super yummy and huge!  I get them with a side of the sweet potato hash- I had never seen these before.  Diced sweet pototoes with a sprinkling of sugar, cinnamon and honey. Yum!  I love that you can order breakfast at dinner.  They also have the most interesting calamari- it isn't fried or breaded and my husband says it some of the best he's ever had.  It is a bit pricey but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Best breafast I've had in my life!!!! Get the Booker T eastside hasher!!!!! I stop in charlotte ever other week and is a must go to!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with my wife after hearing from multiple people how awesome this place is. We went on a Saturday around 12:30, and had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. This place isn't too large, and it gets crowded ... so go early if you don't feel like waiting.   Bunny Rancheros --- JUST DO IT. I recommend it with the chorizo sausage to make it flavorful and a little more 'caliente'. It comes out looking a hot mess ... but it's a pile of awesomeness. It's a huge portion too, so come hungry or ready to share.   Druther's Clucker --- May be my new favorite chicken sandwich. The foccacia bread was perfect way to hold all the delicious ingredients together. The sun-dried tomato mayo spread complimented the sandwich perfectly. For the side, you cannot go wrong with the sweet potato browns."}
{"text":"My favorite go to restaurant for a simple meal. My dad LOVES this place. The cakes are amazing and the champagne cake is our favorite. I love sitting at the bar for brunch. Easy, no wait and the staff are always super friendly. Overall the food is good. It's nothing that blows me away, but I know I will get a decent meal for a good price. And the atmosphere is perfect for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This was the weirdest and by far the worst dining experience in over 1.5 years in Charlotte. Spoiler: spend 2 hours there for a sandwich, nachos and a coffee. First, my family comes in for lunch, the place is busy and there's a family in line before us, so we get ready to wait. In the first 10 minutes nobody even acknowledges our presence. Everybody's just standing around waiting, while 3 different waitresses pass by on multiple occasions. Then the people in front of us get seated. We wait another 10 minutes before the waitress says she'll clear off one of 3 available tables. Two reminders and another 10 minutes later we get seated. The table she cleared off for us has trash around it - straws, utensils, crumbled up dirty napkins on the floor. We wait 15 minutes for the waitress to come around and get our drink order, which doesn't come at all. Then another waitress comes to take the order again, because the previous waitress \"just left\". At this point we've just given up on having any decent service, and agreed that the food has to be outstanding to make up for it. Half of our drink order comes, which were waters, and the waitress forgot to bring a third water for our daughter. I also ordered a cappuccino, which I had to remind the staff members twice about. Another 20 minutes pass. A guy in a dirty t-shirt emerges out of the kitchen, holding our plates: he has guacamole on his hands, touching my husband's plate with nachos, so the outside of the plate is filthy. The nachos were soggy, but if you wait for over an hour for lunch, anything becomes edible. I ordered a gobbler sandwich with a side of roasted potatoes. The sandwich was nothing special, potatoes were cold. You can tell our food was just sitting there forever before it was brought to us. After two reminders I finally got my cappuccino. It was served in a cute mug, but tasted like diner coffee and had a greasy film on top of it, instead of delicious looking milk foam. We finished our meal, at that point the family that was seated before us has just received their food. A few people at the tables around us had delicious looking breakfast items, but after today's experience, there's no way in hell I'm coming back to try those. I was looking forward to trying this place out, and everything from service and food to cleanliness of the place has left me greatly disappointed."}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot.  Fresh food, coffee is really good. Parking is awful."}
{"text":"After hearing great things about this place - we wanted to see for ourselves. .  We headed over at 8:30 on a Saturday night and was surprised to see only a handful of people.  The menu was simple but offered just enough variety. We chose the \"Zada janes favorite\" nachos and the Mecklenburger with roasted potatoes.  Loved it all! Nachos were pilled high with lots of flavorful veggies and chicken.  The burger was tasty and potatoes were perfectly crispy on the outside.  Our bill was reasonable at under $25, service was good and the decor was entertaining.  We will return soon to try some of the other menu items that look good.    The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is a strange sour odor from the time we walked in. I have a sensitive nose but that was really strong! I hope that was something short term has it was very distracting from all the other positive!"}
{"text":"It was a great place to catch up with an old friend and coach. The service was great the food was wonderful and it was a nice setting for long-time reunion overdue"}
{"text":"Awesome food, mimosas, and service! The only thing that sucked was they can't serve mimosas til noon on Sunday's...but that's an NC law and not their fault. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is nicely tucked into plaza midwood. Deff a staple here in this area a must try! For the coffee drinkers if tabitha is working ask for the tabs special. Saturday and Sunday brunches are a bit crowded but i think that say something. Anyways great during the week too! Love this Charlotte gem!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot! I think the food is of great quality! My only issues was with their service experience. Wish it was consistent."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place more & more every time!!! BONUS: It looks like they listened to their customers & lowered the prices!!! So now it's AMAZING & very affordable  It probably seems like someone who works here wrote this but nope....I really love it that much!  I had their meatloaf & she got the smokey bacon shrimp pasta.....both were OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! Well done as usual guys"}
{"text":"In short, decent food in an eclectic atmosphere with a nice patio is completely overshadowed by inexcusably bad service. Today, the food took approximately 30 minutes to come out. A little wait, but not terrible, and it was incorrect (my friend requested a substitution that wasn't there) but overall decent. While finishing our lunch, I politely requested the checks because my friend needed to get to work. Then we waited. And waited some more. I tried to flag down our waitress who avoided eye contact. I had to get up and walk across the restaurant and ask someone else for the check, which still took nearly 10 more minutes.   Add this to a laundry list of bad service experiences at this establishment in the last year, and I guarantee I won't be back."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood around lunch time the other day, and decided to stop in for a quick bite.  After checking out the menu, I decided that I was in the mood for breakfast food.  I was really torn between the \"Booker T's East Side Hasher\" and an omelet.  The Hasher won out.  The sweet potato hash-browns were covered by frittata style eggs made with my choice of protein -  I opted for turkey sausage.  This was covered by melted cheddar.  I decided to get a biscuit and it reminded me of the ones my grandmother used to make.  My server also brought apple butter and berry jam.    The food was good and portion sizes were quite large - I ate half & had enough to take home for another meal. Price was very reasonable at $8.95.  My server was very friendly and kept on top of things. Based on this visit, I would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Well they have a tofu scramble, which is nice to find in Charlotte.  It's pretty hearty, and the addition of peas is a nice touch.  The mushrooms were undercooked, but maybe southerners can't cook mushrooms as well as pennsylvanians (you know cause most mushrooms are grown there haha).  The roasted potatoes were delicious.  I left with a full stomach which doesn't always happen with tofu scrambles."}
{"text":"I wish I could give Zada Jane's more stars but it didn't blow me away.  I liked it but I had a little higher expectations I will definitely be back and check out their brunch though.  All start with all the good stuff first.  1/2 price veggies apps on Wednesdays = awesome and I did enjoy the zucchini & squash cakes 1/2 price bottles of wine - Thurs. & Sund Atmosphere I loved the way the restaurant was decorated and it was cozy Menu has a lot of variety = great place for veggie lovers Salad dressings made in house are kick-ass  Things they can work on Service was just ok not bad but not great Entrees very expensive"}
{"text":"Hipsters in the ghetto, multitudes on Saturday/Sunday mornings seeking sunshine and a breakfast combo, fantastic apple butter, shuffleboard, Vegan/Veggie appeal, and a lack of parking for everyone to enjoy. Zada's is definitely a staple that deserves to be on everyone's breakfast shortlist. Find it odd that I've yet to write a review until now.   Here's the gist: If it's cold or raining, sit inside. If the wait is monstrous, I typically won't stick it out. If it's sunny outside, do yourself a favor and grab table on the patio. If the wait it horrifically long in general and you have to have your Bunny Rancheros fix, take a spot in line and play a few games of shuffleboard.   Pretty sure I get the Bunny Rancheros every time with wheat toast slathered with apple butter. The local chorizo isn't half bad either.   I'm a fan, it's great in a pinch, I like to pretend I'm good at shuffleboard, and I'd definitely take firstmeal at Zada's happen in a pinch. Winner."}
{"text":"ew. just straight ew. i'm sorry this place stinks. maybe it is the best Charlotte has to offer, but it is just gross in there.  no drinks for brunch, you have to have a drink menu if you are going to call yourself a brunch spot.  Also, fruit was blah and the hamburger was the nastiest thing i have ever eaten. fail"}
{"text":"I went to check out the breakfast fare from reading the reviews on here.  Needless to say, I wasn't thrilled.  I ordered scrambled eggs, turkey bacon, herbed spuds and a pancake along w/orange juice and a coffee.  The eggs were okay, the turkey bacon tasted like a cheap store bought brand, it was very chewy and didn't have a good flavor at all, the herbed spuds tasted like they forgot them in the oven all morning.  They were very, very dry and shriveled up, not plump w/a good potatoey texture at all.  The pancake was great!  It was cooked just perfect, soft n fluffy with a perfect crispy edge all around! The coffee was great.  I expected the oj to be fresh, but to my dismay it was a carton brand.  Service was good and the waiter who I think is the owner from the reviews I read sat down in the booth right next to me to take my order, heck he was damn near sitting on my lap! Lol!  Unless I'm craving only pancakes n coffee I may be back, but I doubt it."}
{"text":"I've been hesitate to visit for brunch given the extremely long wait times.  However, when I was craving a salad for lunch this week, I headed to Zada Jane's for a bowl of greens.  I had the chopped salad - subbing mixed greens for the romaine and sunflower seeds for the croutons - with lemon vinaigrette.  The portion was perfect for lunch and filled me up without leaving me uncomfortable.  For vegetarians, this is a great restaurant.  There were three different protein packed and hearty salads sans meat.  The breakfast entrees also sounded very appealing and I'll be back for their biscuits and homemade apple butter."}
{"text":"Pretty good, but didn't live up to the hype.  I had the Blazing Saddles omelet, and the chipotle chicken in it was a little tough.  The roasted potatoes didn't have a lot of flavor.  A friend's blueberry pancake had like 6 blueberries in it.  I really enjoyed the jellies on the table though, and had two yummy (spicy!) bloody marys.  Service was okay...they brought out everyone's food except for one person's so we had to wait on that.  My water sat empty for a long time.  They weren't very busy.  Our server was very friendly, though."}
{"text":"Very cool, eclectic neighborhood restaurant reminiscent of Asheville, NC - great food and neat ambience, recommend the veggie nachos and hummus salad!"}
{"text":"Went to Zada during a busy time. Had about a 40 min wait to get seated and after we placed our order had to wait about an hour before it even came out with no update on how long it would take. Food was very good but not sure if I would return again if it was busy. Not worth it to me"}
{"text":"Went this past Sunday for breakfast with the hubby since I've heard great things about it. We did wait about 25 minutes but it was worth it! I had the basic breakfast with sweet potato hash browns, the most fantastical biscuit with their homemade jam, and I HAD to try the mixed fruit pancake... Hands down best pancake I ever ate! The hubby had bunny ranchero which was a mix of chorizo, black beans, sour cream and eggs, served with tortillas! He licked the plate clean! Would recommend this place especially if you are tired of the same old breakfast joints.. I want to go back this weekend!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal tonight! Sat outside in February! Chef Don sent over some great Pimento Cheese appetizers for our group of 8. The wine was great and our dinner was amazing. 2 of us had prime rib which was perfect! Two others had the salmon which was delicious and very healthy! The other four had the country fried chicken. That was the hit of the night! It was like a \"Party in the mouth\" as one of our friends put it! It was a great way to end the weekend! Plus half price bottles of wine! Check this Plaza Mid Wood jewel out for yourself! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday and it was pretty busy. It was hard to find the host since there is no host sign or stand. Put our name in and was told it would be 30-40 minutes. It was over an hour. I'm usually pretty understanding but when it's double the wait you were told and you see people who came in after you get seated that's pretty frustrating. We also could see on the list the host was holding names crossed off above and below our name. I give the place 3 stars for good food that came in large portions. For waiting an hour I'm expecting GREAT food, so 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped here on a trip to Charlotte on one of her coworkers recommendations. The exterior is cute and quirky with a big patio. The interior is taken up by a large kitchen space in the middle.   The service was friendly and we were seated quickly.  The menu was interesting. Nothing on the menu really appealed to me which was surprising. Either it was salads and sandwiches or $20 entrees. It was a strange mix. I ended up with a salad and a chicken and apple quesadilla. The quesadilla was really good. The salad was pretty standard but had a lot of stuff in it. And the salads are big.  My friend got a chicken sandwich and she didn't really care for the chicken. My friend ended up with food poisoning later that night and was sick all night long. I can't say it was from here, but this was the last place we ate.  At one point they ran out of unsweetened iced tea and the server was really apologetic and didn't charge me. I had already had two glasses and thought that was nice of her.   Overall, this place has potential but just missed the mark for me."}
{"text":"One of my girlfriends had not been to Zada Janes so we met there for dinner the other evening!  Decent wine selection but more of a casual dining experience with a \"dinerish\" feel than a place to have a bottle of wine with the girls.  We grazed on several apps and would definitely recommend.  The best part about the evening.....I left my keys there while we walked down to a different venue, I called when I realized I did not have them, they held them for me and we return to retrieve.  On the counter was a Champagne Pistachio cake with Cream Cheese Frosting staring us in the face.....of what did we say?  \"one piece and 3 forks please....\"  BEST homemade cake I have had in years.  At $7.00 a slice it was overpriced but hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Great spot to have brunch. Plan to wait though because every time I've been, it's packed. The food is farm fresh and local which is a huge plus in my book! Everything I've tried has been delicious. I've never once been disappointed. The coffee is very yummy as well. Service is a bit slow but I'm assuming it's because they are always packed. So just be a bit patient. Definitely a unique menu, not food you will see at a typical breakfast place. All in all, love the food and the cute homey feel of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Zada Janes! My only complaint is that so many others love it just as much as I do which makes getting a table a hectic experience. Be prepared to wait if you come during normal breakfast- brunch hours. Outdoor tables can be wobbly but don't worry, your food won't be on them long!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner Friday night not expecting that much butI must say I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste of their food. I ordered the fish special of the day, which was monkfish, on top of this cheesy smashed potatoes and grilled asparagus... Absolutely amazing and flavorful.  My boyfriend had the pork chop which he loved as well. We also ordered the hummus and tzatziki trio with pita chips that was so yummy that we brought home an extra container. With its downtown artsy vibe reminiscent of the places I used to go in the East Village of NYC, along with great food and service, this place is a definite must."}
{"text":"Been here for 35 minutes with 3 different servers because me and my friend decided to move inside since the servers outside decided to pass us without greeting us. All the servers here look clueless and did not help us at all. The place isn't full and it's taking forever."}
{"text":"See here's the thing, I don't care how good the food may or may not be, if you can't park and you can't EVER get a table, WHO CARES?  As you might be able to tell I'm more than a bit perturbed by my latest encounter with Zada Jane's.  I went here an hour ago looking to grab a quick bite before getting ready for the Super Bowl later today.  This is now the fourth time I have been to Zada Jane's, and I have only been able to eat there once.  No jokes, No exaggeration.    As I was saying I went here on Sunday morning, arrived by 9:10am.  Took 5min to drive around desperately searching for a space.  After finally finding a tight spot, which may or may not have been a real space, my friend and I went in and were told the wait would be 10-15min, we waited 40min.  No one looked close to finishing their meals.   One party had left since we had been waiting.  We had no choice but to bail before we were committed to waiting another 45min to be seated and for our food to arrive.    Zada' Janes may very well have the best damn tasting breakfast in all of Charlotte - maybe their eggs are sent down from heavenly chickens laying only the freshest, locally grown, free range eggs in clouds instead of nests, and their pork cut from only the biggest, muddiest, hogs, I don't know.  But I do know, It's IMPOSSIBLE to get a table and eat a meal on the weekends in any sort of timely fashion at Zada Jane's.  If you look for long lines, and crowded restaurants as any indication of good food, then you'll think Zada Janes is the greatest food known to man.  I, on the other hand, like to eat a good meal, AND be able to get in and out in a timely fashion.  It'll be a long time before I go to Zada Jane' to eat...I mean WAIT."}
{"text":"Five stars for food (best huevos rancheros of my life) but three for service. Our service was very patchy and they forgot to put in orders for two people in my party, so we waited almost an hour before the mistake was realized. Chatting with some regulars at the bar, we were given to understand that that sort of mix-up isn't uncommon, but I guess the food is so good that everyone is willing to keep going back and roll the dice..."}
{"text":"The outside seating is very sunny and hot but the indoor seating was smelly. However our waiter was friendly and cooperative with our seat changes. The food was predictable - nothing memorable m. The food was slow to come."}
{"text":"I stopped by Zada for the first time this week for a mid morning breakfast.  The service was fine, and the menu selection was diverse with some very interesting vegan and vegetarian options.  When I ordered my breakfast combo, the menu indicated I could pick one protein and one carb - and the carb I requested was the cup of fruit.  To my surprise, the waitress told me that there was an upcharge for this - really? an upcharge for a few pieces of melon, when my other options were potatoes, gritz, and a variety of other pretty unhealthy choices!    The food itself was just decent...my scrambled eggs weren't very warm and weren't overly exciting - the turkey bacon had a unique taste and was pretty good, but the biscuit I had seemed rather old, as it was really dried out.    Overall Zada had a nice feel to it, a very unique place with unique menu selections, but I left rather disappointed."}
{"text":"We went to Zada Jane's because it was just down the street from our Air BnB. While the atmosphere is inviting and the staff welcoming, the service was slow. After ordering our food, we were given our beverages and then checked on a handful of times. The bartender seemed to be working all of the jobs and wasn't very organized. We waited an hour for our food only to be told twice, \"it's being plated and coming out in a few minutes.\" We ended up leaving money for our coffees and walking out. I'm sure the service is better during a slower time, but we were not impressed."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food is great and the prices reasonable. A bit noisy inside, but at least it is lively."}
{"text":"going to get straight to the point...only reason for the 3 stars is because i am a BIG fan of zada's breakfast (pancakes, biscuits, french toast), but i'm not a big fan of the lunch options so i had to go with 3 stars instead of 4.     the atmosphere is very cute, fun, and chill.  i have breakfast work meetings there often and it's a great place for us to get together to have a tasty breakfast and discuss work topics without being in a stressful uptight setting like starbucks.  zada janes in much more relaxed and the cafe seems to have it's own lil personality.  biggest flaw is the parking situation....luckily i haven't been there on the weekends but even during the week it's a mess.    to sum it up, definitely a fun place to check out.  my opinion, go get breakfast one morning when it's not crazy hot and eat outside.  just be prepared for the parking situation and your experience should be a good one :)    enjoy!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I looove this place. It is our go to restaurant on lazy afternoons. I like the chicken salad wrap, my wife gets grilled cheese. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Four stars on the following basis: dinner here is the worst, but brunch is amazing; and the staff can suck pretty hard, but if you do get a good server they are really good. It's kind of hit or miss, but when I'm there for brunch (I tried dinner twice before giving up) the pros usually balance out the cons."}
{"text":"The food is great, love the location but the wait on a Sunday mornings is pretty ridiculous. The wait is the sole reason Zada's didn't get 5 stars. Corn-hole makes the wait more tolerable & the food, decor and great service make up for it -just don't go for brunch on a weekend if you're starving or in a hurry!"}
{"text":"We arrived around 9 am on Sunday. It was getting busy and the waitress was nice and friendly but took a while for our food to come (understandable and who is in a hurry on Sunday morning anyway)! I built my own omelette with chicken, bacon, basil, broccoli, and cheddar cheese. The coffee was fresh and delicious and the patio was a perfect place to sit."}
{"text":"Zada Jane's never lets me down! This is a Plaza Midwood gem. Breakfast served all day; local coffee from Dilworth coffee; and a great outdoor patio. The only downside is that the limited seating makes for long waits. I don't bother coming here on weekends.   My usual order is the Bunny Rancheros: potatoes, black beans, & chicken under Eggs. Served with queso, salsa verde, guac, sour cream, and warm tortillas. I promise it tastes better than it sounds! You have to just try it.   The servers are friendly and as attentive as they can be on busy days. The coffee (served in mismatched random coffee mugs) is always refilled before I hit the bottom of the mug...and that's all I ask for!"}
{"text":"Props to the biscuit, jam, bocce court, gravy, friendly waitress.  No-go on the undercooked sweet potatoes, overcooked eggs, hostess, weak coffee.  Overall pleasant experience but food was just OK & the inability of the staff to figure out their seating arrangements, wait times was just unprofessional.  Don't mind waiting at all on a weekend morning, expecting that to happen.  Hearing statements like \"we really need more chairs\" and \"it might be 20 minutes or 2 hours\" just makes it seem like they're either not training hosts or don't care if you stay/go.    I did thoroughly enjoy my biscuit."}
{"text":"Today I came early so the service wasent as terrible as usual.  I am updating my review to 4 stars because the omelette I had was very good (cheddar cheese, green onions, and spinich)."}
{"text":"I've been to Zada Janes more times than I can count.  When it first opened I was eager to give it a chance and they seemed eager to please.  It seems to me that Zada Jane's head has gotten a little big as of late.  The waitstaff is now so elite they could care less to actually serve their customers.  One time, the hostess made us sit outside when it was sprinkling.  She didn't even ask if we wanted to sit inside.  And we were the only people out there.  Our waitress moved us inside the first chance she had.     Over a year ago, I took my dog and ate outside.  The waitress brought me a cup of water for her without me asking.  Wow, have things changed.    This past weekend, a friend and I went for breakfast around 1pm.  We didn't have to wait because we ended up sitting at the bar.  After being seated, we weren't even acknowledged for over 10 minutes but the guy behind the counter was busy serving everyone around us.  When he finally took our drink orders, I was ready to place my order, but he didn't stick around long enough to ask.  It took another 10 minutes to get our drinks.  When we finally did order, he asked for our order and continued talking to other people (I wasn't even sure if he heard me).  After another 20 minutes, our food came out.  Redemption.  The food is delicious (and healthy).  I had the Blazing Saddles - it's an omelet with black beans and chicken topped with sour cream.    Run Down:  If your willing to put up with the snobby, elitist, slow waitstaff to get some delicious breakfast food and you have a couple hours to loaf around, this is a great place for breakfast.  I'm not saying the service is ALWAYS this bad, but I wouldn't risk it.  If you are hungry and you see people waiting to be seated, turn around and go to the Dish or Penguin.  Their service is always fast and friendly.  If you still want breakfast, try the Original Pancake House."}
{"text":"When we first got there we waited about 10 minutes for the hostess to even take down our name. The person in line in from of us left because he had been waiting so long. We had about a 30 min wait which isn't a big deal especially since it was Sunday afternoon. I ordered the tofu curry scramble which doesn't mention on the menu that it's covered in peas (which I don't like) then I noticed that lipstick was on my coffee cup and it wasn't mine as I wasn't wearing lipstick. I told my server Melissa about it and she said \"oh that's unfortunate, I'll grab you a new one\" no apology and still got charged for everything. I asked if I could not get charged for the coffee and she said well I only charged you for 2 instead of 3. Won't be returning to this place"}
{"text":"Had an omelette.  Nothing fantastic, but good.  Service was hurried, but there was a mob waiting to eat.  Don't go when you are hungry on a Sunday morning - you might starve!"}
{"text":"Friday night was chill. We walked up in the place, and there were like two couples inside and a table of 3 people outside. It was rather cold inside, so we went outside to take advantage of the brief sunny weather that decided to peak out during the midst of all this rainy weather. It was breezy and cool... perfect. There were at least 3 different people (I think) coming to our table. I LOVE people watching so the area definitely served that purpose.   I didn't get a chance to capture our appetizer through photo, but it was good and healthy. Pita bread with zuchinni/squash patties and tzaziki sauce. The sauce was decent... I felt it was missing something. I've been to some good Greek restaurants and I can taste the difference. The patties needed a little flavor.   I had the Huevos Rancheros and that was pretty good. It would have been better if they gave me like 3 or 4 tortillas; as it was A LOT of food and two just wasn't gettin' it. I think they folded them and put it on my plate for presentation. They could have just wrapped it up in some foil and put it on the side.   The 4 Layer Chocolate Cake was decadent. It was fresh, as I was told they order this from another bakery daily or every other day. Would have been nice to have a dollop of some vanilla ice cream on the side.   Other than that, the service was decent. It dwindled down a bit when others came. No refills to the water when we really needed it after the cake came (since there was no ice cream to wash it down with... yes... wash it down). Also, I don't think I'm going to have people box my food anymore. She came out with the cake and left me wondering where my food was. I think after it comes out, I like to keep it in my sight.   All in all, a decent joint."}
{"text":"We eat at Zeda Janes regularly - service is always slow (sometimes painfully) but the food is good, so if it's a Saturday morning and we don't have anywhere to be it can be worth it. We came in this morning when we had off work (thinking it would be a little quieter than a weekend) and sure enough we got sat right away. We put in our order and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. For about an hour. Everyone who was sat after us had their food and finally the waitress came to tell us that there had been an error with the computer and our ticket was never put in. Not ideal- but mistakes happen so we continued waiting. And waiting. And waiting. At this point we'd been there for at least an hour and a half, and it had been 30 minutes since we were made aware of the mistake. We told the waitress we were going to head out and she asked if she could go check on the food to see if it was almost ready. 5 minutes later she came back and said it was about 3 tickets behind. When they realized they never put in our order they didn't even move it to the front of the line??? I can assure you that the food CANNOT overcome service that is THIS terrible.   There are plenty of brunch places in Charlotte with awesome food where they will actually treat you like a paying customer. Go to one of those."}
{"text":"We love Zada's! Jodie makes the best Mimosa and Bloody Mary and always has a smile on her face.  Great variety and selection of healthy, fresh, and local food whether you are a vegetarian or not. The bacon is amazing as is the French toast and their Huevos. Sometimes we just grab a biscuit to go which is also a great option.  Don't miss out on this spot! It does get crowded at high times but Jodie will make you a mimosa or there is free coffee while you wait!"}
{"text":"Consistent, eclectic fare at reasonable prices.   Large portions.   I eat mostly breakfast at ZJ's, have tried most of the menu over the years, and keep going back.   I've even figured out when to arrive so I can park!"}
{"text":"There are many things I like about Zada Jane's - in concept.  They're in my neighborhood, which means when I wake up craving brunch I don't have to drive across town.  They have a variety of vegetarian options (I'm not a vegetarian, but I'm not a heavy meat-eater either).  They use local sources for their food.  They have a funky and eclectic décor.  They have free coffee while you wait for a table.    Unfortunately, whenever I go there, the reality tends to play out like this: I wake up craving brunch, but when I get there the line out the door.  It's so chaotic inside that it takes me ten minutes to find someone to put my name on the list.  I fight my way through the throng to get some coffee only to discover there aren't any coffee cups.  Then I wait so long for a table that by the time I sit down I could have driven across town, eaten somewhere else and gotten back home again.  And that's not even counting how long it takes for my food to come out.  When my food finally does arrive, every other time it's overcooked or undercooked, or it tastes like someone spilled a whole salt shaker in my hash browns.  But I eat it anyway, because there is no way I'm sending anything back and waiting for it to be cooked again.  And then I wait....and wait...AND WAIT for my server to remember I'm there and bring me my check.  By the time I leave I've lost three hours, and I'm not even fat and happy.  (Just fat.)  There's no denying this is a popular place, but sometimes I wonder if other people are having a different experience from mine, or if they've decided they love it so they put up with the slow service and the inconsistencies with the quality of the food.    Whatever the case may be, my husband and I have decided not to waste our time on Zada Jane's anymore.  We've had too many broken-hearted brunches to let ourselves be hurt again.  We've found a new brunch spot - Foskoskies on Shamrock.  We have yet to be disappointed there."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be unique. We had lunch on 1/16/15. Food took 45 min. To be delivered & was not edible. Plus our credit card was charged twice. Will not recommend or go back. Too many other great restaurants in area. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Due to the crazy lines on the weekend, I now only visit Zada Janes on off-hours (I realize this is becoming a theme in all my reviews--i.e., I hate going to places when they are busy. So be it).  When I do visit, I am particularly fond of Z-J's East-West breakfast--which is a tofu curry scramble that doesn't leave you with that gross I-ate-way-too-much-at-brunch feeling.  They also have more decadent offerings, such as their vanilla french toast and very delicious (if not artery-clogging) sweet potato egg hash.    If you ever have a chance, it is particularly nice to stop by during a weekday for brunch (a rare but lovely occurrence for me when it does happen), and I'm hopeful it will be a good place for me to grab a bite with my bambino when that time comes.    Also, they seem to have great hours and appear to be open throughout the day, for which I give them many many high fives.  Service has always been excellent here, too."}
{"text":"I have always heard about this place and people have been recommending it to me since about 2014. I was always unsure of what they served and hesitant when seeing the place, but I must say it definitely proved me wrong. We came here for brunch after drooling over the pics of dishes online. We were sold with the steal they had on bottles of champagnes for mimosas. It was more than enough and could barely finish the bottle between the two of us. As far as food, I ordered the Belvedere with sweet potato mash, and a side caesar salad. The omelette was amazing! The sweet potato mash? Not so much kind of just left that alone. The Caesar salad was great after I picked all the sun dried tomatoes out because they were a bit overwhelming. Nonetheless, as crazy as it sounds I was still very much so satisfied with my meal and experience. We had great service from the bartender Tab. She kept us laughing and was on point with everything we needed. I see why this place is highly recommended and I can't wait to return to make use of their outdoor area."}
{"text":"I have visited Zada many times when I lived close to the neighborhood.  The breakfast was always spot on especially the Bunny Rancheros which was great even as a to go order.  Honestly one of the best breakfast dishes in Charlotte.   I moved away a few years ago and I convinced my spouse, who has never been, that the waking up early and drive to Zada to beat the crowd would be worth the effort.  We got there at the crack of open for our visit because there were many other days we drove by and he said, \"it's too crowded\".  We were one of the first seated so I'm glad.  We were ignored. Embarrassingly a while ignored.  Enough where we got to witness a couple sat well after us arguing about why this place was a \"hot spot\".  Thankfully we were finally approached and gave both drink and food order because we weren't sure if we would have another opportunity. I ordered the special that I swear was pork belly on biscuits and my husband ordered the Bunny Rancheros because I have talked about it for years.  18 minutes later my husband got his food and we got our drinks. We started eating his breakfast because, well damn, we were hungry.   Our server finally came back and I was told,\"sorry, we don't have biscuits. would you like something else?\".  Honestly?  Erase it from your special board before you open.  As we were still sitting we heard an employee possible manager say the biscuits were burned throw them out and fire another. Then our server came out and asked after we ate the Rancheros if I would still like my biscuit pork belly order.   I understand bad days.  I understand burnt biscuits.  I loved Zada so much I convinced someone who had never been to get there the moment they opened.   It was honestly the most awkward introduction to a restaurant recommendation and one of the most memorable never coming back experiences ever."}
{"text":"Wanted to take my out-of-town guests here for breakfast. One guest has dietary concerns and she wanted to see a menu before we went. Their website says they serve breakfast all day but the breakfast menu is nowhere to be found.   We thought if we could get a few answers about the food it would clarify if my guest could eat there but no one answers the phone even when its not peak business.  Guess they don't need ours."}
{"text":"Very fun, eclectic feel. The atmosphere seems like a place where creativity would thrive.   We had a special dip with mint and feta cheese with pita bread, which was delicious! The Green Mindmelt Panini was very good as well.   The service was friendly. We didn't feel rushed so we were able to enjoy the evening, no pressure.  Zada Jane's is a quirky cafe which gives the impression that it is a casual and moderately priced place; however, they have some high priced entrees on the menu. The fancy entrees feel misplaced here. I think that if I want to spend a lot on a steak, I would go elsewhere for the environment."}
{"text":"Wow I can't believe I never wrote a review of awesome Zada Janes!  I hate vegetables! My girl is the opposite. She is in fact a vegetarian. This is why zada janes has one of the best things in Charlotte for me. They offer one of the ultimate in meatatarian breakfast dishes in the Vegless Avenger.  Picture a giant fluffy egg filled with bacon, sausage, chicken, chorizo, and everything meatalicious. This is the best hangover cure and source of protein ever, though probably not the healthiest.  My girl on the other hand loves the nachos and the bunny rancheros.  The coffee is great and so is that jack and coke in the morning.  This is my favorite breakfast spot in plaza midowood.  I have never have tried the night menu, but this is definitely a awesome spot for lunch/brunch.  Also, there is shuffleboard to get your geezer on."}
{"text":"Zada Janes is wonderful. It quickly became my favorite brunch spot in Charlotte. The variety of people (and dogs) outside makes Zada Janes feel so welcoming and sunny.   I love their blend of southern classics (grits, biscuits) with southwestern options and vegan and vegetarian options. And best of all, they support local vendors when they can. Zada Janes has something for everyone.   When I sat outside with my dog, a waiter came up to ask if he needed water and brought over a bucket. I'm just as happy inside, where the purple walls and funky art make me feel at home.   Fair warning: Service can be a little slow when they're packed, but go early or late and you shouldn't have an issue."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to visit this iconic breakfast place (that also serves lunch), in the awesome Plaza Midwood area.   Short version: I went for breakfast/brunch and I enjoyed everything I had. The service was great. Parking in the lot is very limited but parallel parking on the street is also available (I was there on a weekday around 11:30am). Definitely try it especially if you have been to eateries in Asheville and like that vibe.  Long version: Had a brunch with some peeps we ordered a Breakfast Salad, Booker T's Sweet Potato Hash and Belvedere Omelet (I'm actually missing one dish because I can't remember what it was) and a side of Gluten Free pancake.  Everything was delicious. Everyone loved their food. The Gluten Free pancake was the best GF pancake I had ever had that wasn't made at home. I also ordered an orange juice because it's one of the few places that actually has fresh squeezed.  One of the members in my party was celebrating a birthday and they were kind enough to bring out a slice of Red Velvet cake for her.   Overall, it was a great experience and would like to return. I don't know how they fair on weekends but they don't have a huge amount of seating indoors but do have a patio area with fire pits and that section is pet friendly. There is free parking on the side streets and their lot offers rooms for about 8-10 cars so get there early!"}
{"text":"Service is outstanding. Food is fresh and delicious. The variety is impressive. We have been here 4-5 times and have loved each visit!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is one of those meals that seems to dirty all the pots, pans and dishes. This past weekend, I just wasn't feeling that so I ran through the nearby spots in my head and picked Zada Jane's Corner Cafe for my next meal. My husband and I arrived at 9 so the first wave of diners had already breezed through. We opted for cappuccino and a hot tea. I was impressed with how hot my coffee stayed. Our server gave my husband an extra hot water half way through the meal to get another cup out of that loose leaf tea. Nice! Its cold next to those brick walls on a chilly day so that was much appreciated.  I opted to piece a breakfast together which I normally do. Got two eggs over easy, bacon and a biscuit with herb gravy. I looove that gravy. It's loaded with thyme. Mmmm. Bacon more crisp than I make it for myself but who cares when the rest is so satisfying?  We had great service and left nice and full!  Cozy up to the sit at counter if there is a wait."}
{"text":"The only knock on this place is the lack of seating availability while you wait.  I took my father here for brunch and we both enjoyed the omelette over the sweet potato hash."}
{"text":"When a place is so popular they don't need to give a shit about customers to get business.. they still should.  That's just business ethics.   I'll spare you the details of my experience.  suffice to say, very rude."}
{"text":"This place was really cool. The decorations and artwork were neat. I had eggs with their roasted sweet potatoes which have been my favorite breakfast food in Charlotte. My husband got their grits and are definitely the best grits I've ever tried. Would come back again."}
{"text":"I was pretty pumped to go to this place for breakfast- I love breakfast food! I had the pancakes and the sweet potato Browns which were both delicious. The only critique I could give was that they were a little slow, although it was very busy and they had said they were down a person. It was a beautiful day outside so sitting out on the patio was also very nice."}
{"text":"I love to pop in and grab a coffee here. Last night I wanted to try a sit down meal. The meal read great, it was hard to decide on one item. I went for a splurge with the Breakfast burger which I order medium rare. My date also got the Meatloaf burger. The food took quite a long time to come out. We were the only guest in the restaurant which seemed like an open invitation for our server to invite herself to never leave out table. It was a bit annoying to be unable to speak to the person I can with 90% of the meal. She was kind and I don't think she knew what she was doing but you have to take social clues as a server. Finally she went and got our food and my burger was beyond well done. Super dry and just completed over cooked. My boyfriend was supposed to have a slice of meatloaf on her burger but it was just a normal burger patty. The only true positive is the Chai Latte and the Jalapeño bacon Mac side item. It isn't worth the price in my opinion. I have a hard time giving this place the 2 stars I think it really deserves because I truly love coming here for coffee."}
{"text":"If it had not been my last experience at my neighborhood Zada Janes that review would have had an additional star.  I adore this local gem and can forgive its short comings so-so service and all. My favorite is the bunny rancheros from the breakfast served all day menu. What a heaping of fresh food. However, I visiting Zada Janes last Sunday with a Groupon. I have never been hassled more for using a Groupon- even at sustainably more expensive establishments. For you see, a business chooses to send out a Groupon with the hope of attracting new or repeat customers. Since it was Sunday we enjoyed a bottle of half priced wine and then were told that since we had participated in this \"deal\" that we wouldn't be able to use our Groupon. Well- our Groupon did not apply to alcohol purchased so there would not have not been any additional discounts on that \"sale\" purchase. Instead of handling this with a smile we were lectured for several minutes about how we should have known better. I was so dismayed and as I explained- we live in the neighborhood- really enjoy eating here and will be back without a Groupon next time we come. Still- the lecture continued about combining discounts- on a Groupon that had none of this fine print. This last experience at Zada Janes really undid the delicious taste of my steak pita wrap and creme brulee  and apple cake desserts we ordered.  Yes- we did tip on the full undiscounted amount of the check. I'm all for supporting local business but this was a very negative experience on what I hoped would have been a relaxing Sunday evening night out."}
{"text":"Pumpkin pancakes are in season!"}
{"text":"Service wasn't great but the food more than made up for it! Great local ingredients and perfectly paired dishes. Huge portions as well. Definitely a go to for hangover breakfast!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the food at Zada Jane's.  It is my daughter's favorite restaurant.  However, the service is absolutely dreadful.  Slow Slow slow no matter how busy or not busy.  Slow to seat us, slow with drinks, slow with the meal, it is really amazing.  Obviously impatient wait staff would rather chat with each other or customer's at the counter than serve the tables.  Amazing that Zada Jane's hasn't addressed their service problem.    We only go there when we have loooooooooootttttttttttttssssssssssss of time and aren't too hungry.  There are some great restaurants in the neigborhood that are getting our business simply because of the service issues."}
{"text":"This is the type of place where you can go and be content with life.  I went for their widely raved about Sunday brunch and I must say that it did not disappoint the service was friendly and the you could tell that it was a real community hotspot as most people simply walked from the near by neighborhood.   I absolutely hate coffee and all that it stands for, but when the waitress suggested that I should still try because it was that amazing, I decide to just give a try. I am glad I did.  At the time i went the coffee was local roasted by Dilworth Coffee and had a distinct flavor I had yet to taste  in this city. Maybe it was the french or maybe it was my imagination but it was AMAZING!  The food portions were adequate and tasted delicious. I got and omelet and sweet potato hash that were out of this world great.  Also big ups for the Gluten Free menu with awesome flavor.  If your ever in the mood for day of good conversation and inviting community try Zada Jane's it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Awesome food, came for breakfast and it was great. Sausage and spuds were excellent. Biscuits and pancakes were also nicely done."}
{"text":"After looking at other pictures, I'm wondering if I even ate at the same place as everyone else. We went on July 4th (which we were prepared for a wait since a lot of places were closed). There were several empty tables, but we were told the wait would be 30 mins...ok, not so bad, as we were being seated we were told the kitchen was backed up and would take 45 mins to get our food. We were seated after about 20 mins and our waitress was just very...odd. Not rude, but also just kind of annoyed that we were ready to order (we didn't want to waste our whole day sitting around so we ordered drinks and food together when she came around the first time.   My husband ordered pancakes and they were fine. I ordered bunny rancheros with bacon...it showed up as a hot mess and nothing like the other pictures I saw on yelp. Even though my side was bacon, they crumbled it up and it was all over the plate, under eggs, under potatoes, etc. I'm not sure why I wasn't given a couple slices of bacon on the side. It was all ok, but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"ah, zada jane's.  i have actually heard one of the servers say, \"we are not really known for our service,\" before.  i don't honestly think there service is bad, it is just the wait.  on a mild sunday last year, they didn't have the patio seating available.  i had the novel idea to go ahead and get our food to go rather than wait the quoted 45-60 minutes for a table indoors.  we sat outside and enjoyed our brunch in half that time.  i felt like i came up with a rounder wheel that day.  this time around, my dining partner and i put our name in and walked casually down to nova's for a croissant to tide us over while we waited.  in the most surrealist of experiences, they called our name not two minutes after we walked back through the door.  we were seated, served, ate, and had check paid all within a half hour.  i am PRETTY sure we were at zada jane's but i am not sure with it being such a whirlwind of convenience.  the food is actually worth the wait on slower days.  the grateful growers meats, the meat alternatives, the locally grown foods all just taste a little more pure.  the sausage has a good spice to it.  the turkey bacon is really quite savory.  the happy eggs are always satisfactory.  the french toast is to die for.  its just the wait.  and honestly, if you think about it, they do a fantastic job orchestrating the ridiculousness that is a plaza midwood brunch scene.  with the slews of families, hungover couples, straight from church groups, and friends just catching up, the place is always slammed.  all those people must think it is worth the wait as well..."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with a friend and we sat out on the patio. I loved the patio it was a great atmosphere for a meal.  Our server was super friendly and helped me out when I was looking to get a half caff latte but they had to improvise as they were out of some ingredients. The coffee was perfect when I got it.  I got the kind of catch all breakfast, two fried eggs, black beans, grits and toast.  The eggs were cooked way more than I had wanted but were decent. The grits were totally flavorless. The black beans were my favorite, they were good.  Overall I found the breakfast to be very bland but would be interested in trying something else on the menu. I saw some people eating hash type breakfasts that looked delicious."}
{"text":"I thought I was hallucinating again but there it was: A quaint, trendy corner diner chock full of vegetarian delightfulness. The one drawback I had was that it took a literal eternity to get our food, but once it arrived it was like a choir of magical angels were singing a happy hummus song. I had ordered the Hummus salad and it was far more than I had bargained for. A massive plate hit my table with a scrumptious salad on the left side, hummus and couscous in separate ramekins sat in the center, while an array of toasted pita bread fanned out the right side of the plate. Couldn't even get through a third of it before feeling like I was going to explode. The prices weren't too bad here either. If the wait time wasn't quite as long, it'd be my lunch break pit stop every day at work."}
{"text":"Cute spot for brunch! We sat outside and it was a lovely atmosphere with great service. The bacon omelette was incredible and so are their potatoes. My boyfriend got the biscuit with gravy and an egg and loved it. Iced coffee was really good too. Unfortunately, they do not have gluten free bread but do have gluten free pancakes. Wait was not too long on Saturday afternoon! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"My experience at Zada Jane's today is worth writing about.   I went to Zada's with the intention of grabbing a bit, sitting outside and getting some work done. A party of three was walking into the restaurant as I got out of my car. When I got inside, I saw that they had been waiting for a minute or two so I decided to use the restroom. After coming out, I saw the party leave. I waited around for a few more minutes before grabbing a menu and heading to a table outside.   About 25-30 minutes passed before another table was seated outside, and a server appeared to take their drink order. I looked up in an attempt to grab the server's attention, but she went a roundabout way to get back inside without passing my table despite the fact that it was right next to the other party. I dismissed the incident and assumed she was busy. This happened yet again the next time she came outside so I finally got up and left. I was at Zada's for over 45 minutes without ever being acknowledged.   To say the service was poor is an understatement. There was no service."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I used to LOVE this place. The food is SO good and the gluten free and vegan options are great! But I think I will stick to getting take out from now on. Not only is the service terrible but the staff is SO rude. I feel like it gets worse and worse every time. I get it's busy but that isn't an excuse to be outright rude to paying customers."}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times before and had an awesome experience. The bunny rancheros, duthers clucker and veggies nachos are a winner every time! We talked very highly of Zada to our friends and decided to take them there for brunch two Sunday's ago. Ugh not a good idea.   Zada must of had an off day, because my friend ordered a mushroom Swiss spinach bacon omelet and the server didn't tell us they were out of spinach and mushrooms till she brought the food out. Um hello?! Since the omelet didn't have veggies she essentially got a half pig in her omelet. We had the remake the Omelet and go lighter on the bacon which took 15 minutes. Meantime everyone else sat while their food got cold and my chicken sandwich was over cooked which was disappointing. Anyways, when the check came the server said she removed the cost of the spinach and that's all. Well I hope you would.......  We always have had a good experience here, but it was embarrassing brining friends and it being bad, but don't worry I'll be back!!!   Recommendation: don't wait till 1:30/2 to go to brunch ;)"}
{"text":"This is a great establishment. After looking for a little Asheville style restaurant we finally found Zada Jane's. We have come here a few times during the week and have always been happy with everything."}
{"text":"The food is pretty delicious and unique and the location is quite charming, and the prices are reasonable. So why am I being stingy with my stars? Well the service here is really quite horrible. Maybe I caught our waitress on a bad day or something but she couldn't possibly have been more rude or nasty.  It all begins when we walked into the place and no one decides to talk to us for about 10 minutes until I walk up to the counter and am told I can just sit anywhere. Okay understandable, I wish you had told me that earlier when I had walked in. Anyways I ask if we can move the tables around outside and the girl at the bar says sure thing. While sitting there waiting for the rest of the party to arrive, our waitress comes up and asks if we're sure they're coming. I feel like this was kind of a veiled attempt to ask if me if the rest of the party ditched us, and am tempted to give a sarcastic response but instead ask for a glass of water. She never brings any water. So finally everyone's arrived and the drink orders are taken before she brings any water around. I'm pretty excited about the food because it was a pretty delicious sounding menu. It takes a really long time for our food to come out even though there's only one other table of four there with us, but that's okay because we're having fun chatting and discussing the rest of the night out. Well the food finally comes out and I ask her if she could take a picture of us. She's like well how about I make sure everyone's happy with their stuff before I get around to you okay? Well excuse me! I wasn't aware that taking 10 seconds out of her busy schedule of ignoring my empty water glass to take a picture was going to bother her that much. And yes I did ask for my water glass to be filled but she never did get around to it, and disappeared off somewhere until it came time for the check.  I almost didn't tip her but I convinced myself to anyways since I still managed to have a good time despite all that. I don't think I'll ever be back unless I get dragged back though. I love the food and the atmosphere, but I like my food without a side of bad attitude, and I don't enjoy getting ignored either. I can think of places just as good that treat me with respect."}
{"text":"First time, so perhaps approached this place with unbiased eyes as someone from out of town, but I was not impressed. Server was surly. The \"signature\" plate of Bunny Rancheros was terrible. The potatoes were greasy and mushy, the black beans dumped out of a can, the chipotle chicken was dry and overcooked and the over easy eggs were undercooked. It was truly a flavorless and visually unappealing mess.  My friend added a pancake to his meal and it was rubbery.   Décor may have been cute 10 years ago but the place looks tired and the food certainly doesn't make up for it.  Given the amazing number of other breakfast and brunch spots, I was amazed that there was a wait for tables. I can't say I'll be heading back - there are so many other great breakfast spots around CLT!"}
{"text":"This place seemed pretty normal.  WE went at 11:15 on a Saturday and didn't have to wait.  The service was fine but not impressive.  They don't allow substitutions and i HATE that.  The omelet I had with goat cheese was quite yummy and the biscuits weren't bad.  If you are into that whole organic/natural thing then this is def the place for you.  I  have heard the coffee is good but I can't say from experience."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but it took a LONG time to come, and my sandwich was cold, so in the end, it was just an okay lunch. I might come back for the outside patio, but there's not much else to recommend Zada Jane's."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to brunch at Zada Jane's on a Thursday about 10am after hearing from great things from locals. However, after poor service, incredibly slow responses in every department and very lack luster food, I couldn't see myself ever returning.  My visit was mid-morning on a Thursday and the disorganization started when my group of six walked in. Do you wait for a table or seat yourself? I'd recommend at least checking in before sitting, especially if you want to sit on the patio. I placed an order for a TLC biscuit with a fried, runny egg, cheddar cheese and apple maple bacon. I was wit a party of six people and we waited 45 minutes for our food. During this time our waiter never checked on us, let us know when our food would be out or apologized/explained the long wait. When the food finally did arrive, it was not delivered together, there was a fifteen minute gap between meals arriving, with my simple biscuit arriving last. Two of our orders were incorrect, including mine where the fried egg was completed cooked through with a broken yoke and cheese was missing from my meal. After having them re-do my meal they biscuit arrived back with one tiny slice of bacon, way too much cheese and the actual biscuit was very sub-par. I would have blown it off as a simple kitchen mistake, but everything about Zada Jane's screamed \"problem\": from the food, to the slow service and waits to the waiter himself.  As a regular restaurant patron, I am paying for a meal and an experience that I cannot replicate at home. I would highly discourage anyone thinking of visiting Zada Jane's to save yourself from a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I love going here for brunch or an early breakfast.  Convenient to home and I love how they offer you free coffee if there is a wait.  great place to chill and relax after a long night.  I never feel rushed here and I always order something different and have yet to be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for breakfast on New Years Day. The basic breakfast potatoes were delicious and seasoned perfectly. My wife's French toast with the apple butter and grits was \"amazing\".  The atmosphere was upbeat and social. Overall we had a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Literally the WORST experience I have had going out in Charlotte.  The food came out SO slowly. It was just breakfast, but it took as long as a fine dining dinner to come to the table.  I had ordered a simple breakfast sandwich with bacon on it..... it featured ONE slice of bacon. Bojangles and Dunkin Donuts makes a abetter breakfast sandwich.  My wife ordered a more substantial meal, and hers came out burnt badly and look disgusting on the plate.  It takes a pretty awful meal for my wife to leave a meal mostly untouched.... and this was that AWFUL meal.  Between being slow, cheap and gross..... I feel comfortable saying that there is no worse place to get a breakfast in Charlotte."}
{"text":"There is nothing more frustrating then waiting and waiting for a table first thing in the morning, especially after a night that was heavy on the Patron.  However I'll wait all day at Zada Jane's downing some of the best coffee I've had in the area. Typical wait can be around 15-30 minutes for a Saturday or Sunday brunch.  Once you do get seated order biscuits while you go through the menu because everything is good and you may go through a serious debate on what to order.  If I can be of any assistance I'll just say that you cant go wrong with the Amaretto French Toast or the Bunny Rancheros."}
{"text":"Breakfast at zada janes is great but I am particularly fond of their dinner. The steak my fiancé has gotten and the chicken I have gotten are always delicious. The sides are great and it's always fresh! I suggest it for dinner for sure!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to check out Zada Janes but not so super excited after waiting 45 minutes for my food!  That's right - 45 minutes.  So first things first, Zada is a very cute place.  The outside patio is located on a corner so you can eat and people watch all at the same time!  The menu has very unique options.  I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with sundried tomatoes, caramelized onions and mozzarella cheese served on foccacia bread and my side was the black eye pea salad.  The food was quite delicious!  That is, when we finally got it.    Here is the scoop on the service.  We walked in and then immediately following us 2 other groups of people walk in.  The waitress takes their order first even though we had arrived earlier!  No biggie, I thought.  Well...I was wrong.  After waiting 25 minutes all the other tables had their food.  I waited another 10 minutes.  I finally got so heated that I walked in to find the server and politely told her that we had been waiting nearly 40 minutes for our food and that people who arrived after us had their meal.  Her response was \"Sorry about that. We have a small kitchen.  I'll see what I can do about it.\"  We got our food about 7-8 minutes afterward.  In addition to having a long wait, my glass stood empty for long periods of time.  I could tell by the looks on other people's faces that they were in similar boats!    Given the circumstances, and my complaint, I thought maybe they would comp one of our meals or even my friend's drink.  Maybe offer a free dessert?  Just something  to say - hey, I know you didn't have the best experience tonight.  Well, we got nothing! With that being said, I'm not headed back anytime soon.  Not to mention, after reading other reviews, I'm not alone in my terrible service experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Awesome place... Great service... Kids and dogs welcome. Eat out on the patio on a beautiful day. I had a latte and the Bunny Rancheros... So good. Play shuffleboard on the sidewalk while your waiting on your meal or afterwards.   If I'm in Charlotte again, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Let's start off with the breakfast food being good. This review is geared towards their service. Our server Rachel was absolutely terrible. Firstly, she never even introduced herself. I only know her name because I had to ask another server. Then, they forgot one of our cocktail for our table and only when she came to take our order said \"oh they didn't bring it? Huh... Well what do you want to eat?\"  Being vegetarian, I asked if I could swap the chicken on my dish for guacamole (which is cheaper than chicken on their menu) to which she dismissively said \"no\" without even asking or trying to accommodate. She actually never came back (someone else brought our food) and no one ever came back to check on us (no refills, nothing) we had to flag down a totally different server after 15 minutes of finishing our food to ask for our check (Alexandra, who to be fair, was quite pleasant)  It was our first time but will certainly be our last."}
{"text":"Slowest service you will EVER experience when they are busy. Food is cool, but you may have to wait.   That said, I have their number saved in my phone and visit EVERY TIME I come to Charlotte. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I'll just get this out of the way and say the service wasn't great, which is why it's only four stars, but everything else WAS great.  This was my first time to Zada Jane's because the patio is always packed, so I assumed there was a long wait. Our party of hour only waited about 20 minutes though.   I got the Bunny Rancheros with the Chipotle Chicken, and would do it again. There was a healthy helping of both home fries and black beans and the cool guacamole was a good contrast to the heat of the rest of the dish.   I only ordered coffee, but I did try my fiance's chai latte, which was to die for.  The atmosphere was cool. A lot of local art, memorabilia and knick-knacks."}
{"text":"Cute place with good food but slow service. Went in on a Sunday morning at 9:00am to a bunch of open tables but by 9:30 the place was filling fast! Sat for a few minutes before being helped but our sever brought waters right off the bat so all was good. Ordered a latte which took about 15 minutes til it got to the table, next time I'll stick to black coffee for simplicity. I was really craving some coffee and was bummed with the wait. Ordered the Belvedere omelette with herb potatoes, a biscuit and a side of well done bacon. There were 5 of in our party so not sure if that caused the wait, but it was at least 20 minutes from ordering to plates on the table. We were all soooo hungry and very happy to see our breakfast! The omelette was really good, very goat cheesy (which I like) and the potatoes were awesome. Biscuits are buttery and my bacon came out normal (not well done) but it was at least crunchy so all was good.  Overall I liked this place and would return but will try different timing so the wait for food isn't too bad. Prices not horrible, but not cheap. Omelette meal, added side of bacon and latte with tip was $22."}
{"text":"It took 35 minutes for our food to show up, and alas, it was cold... with gross soggy potatoes. Feel like we wasted our money. The restaurant was not busy, so we weren't really sure what the delay was. It looks like Zada Jane's is kind of going downhill and I hope the owners take note. With so much great competition in Plaza Midwood restaurants cannot afford to let things like this slide. Disappointing experience and I don't think I will be returning unless this issue, which looking at the reviews is common, is resolved."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots in the neighborhood, we go at least once a week.  Sit at the bar for the best service and the most fun, especially when Jodi is working!  But not on Thursday, that's my day and we'll have to talk if you're in my seat!  Seriously, the food is great, staff is wonderful, we love it!"}
{"text":"My husband & I were visiting Charlotte for the first time and my sister recommended Zada Jane's for breakfast. Everything was excellent, especially the roasted spuds and biscuit with the mixed berry jelly! We were in town for 5 days and ate here 3 of them. It was so good we figured there was no reason to try breakfast anywhere else."}
{"text":"I had brunch with a friend this morning. Waited 20 minutes for a table upon arriving and was then seated. We both ordered full meals and coffee/lattes. After finishing our food, we continued to talk and drink our coffees. Our waiter was very much present while we were eating but disappeared after dropping off the check (and never filled up waters). After 10-15 minutes after getting the checks (still drinking coffee) we were asked to leave because they were on a wait and needed the table. I found this incredibly rude. Furthermore, it wasn't even our waiter that told us, he told someone else and had them come ask us to leave. This left a sour taste in my mouth for sure. I won't be going back to Zada Janes for a long time. Plenty of other brunch places that appreciate their patrons - and are respectful. As far as the food, my eggs were over cooked and the fruit was just ok (soggy melon, strawberries and grapes with tops/stems still in place). A disappointing experience. Will visit Jack Beagles, Bistro La Bon or other local spots before going back to ZJs."}
{"text":"Two of six in our party headed here early to put our names in on a 45-minute wait for Sunday brunch. This was a smart move on our part! There's a lot of reviews about bad service, but while our server only gave us the bare minimum of service (they were pretty busy), it wasn't BAD. The food was very tasty and the Bunny Rancheros was plenty of food to share. Add a TLC biscuit and you've got a great breakfast. We'll be back to the restaurant again, for sure, and will likely send scouts ahead of time again."}
{"text":"Good coffee, Great biscuits, great service.  They could use some sort of barrier to tone down the street noise"}
{"text":"I'm a newbie to the Plaze Midwood area, but I have already been to Zada Jane's twice.  I refuse to go back, though.  The first time was a few months ago on an early Saturday afternoon.  It wasn't that busy, so there were only two servers.  Service was semi-prompt, nothing too worrisome at the time.  What stood out most was the server who acted like she did not want to be there.  She wasn't exactly rude, but she was a downer and really killed any vibe of having a good experience.  They also couldn't make an iced coffee.  Seriously?  No ice cubes?  Whatever, I moved on and ordered lunch.  It took almost 30 minutes!!  The food was decent, which is why they get 2-stars instead of 1-star.  My friend came into town and we decided to get breakfast on a Tuesday morning.  I decided to give it a try again because they had good selections and it was close.  We walked in and told to seat ourselves.  Then we waited.....a long time.  It was almost 10 minutes and nobody even came to our table.  No menus.  Nothing.  My friend agreed that it was ridiculous and we took a couple minutes to look for other places.  In that time, nobody still came to our table.  We got up and started walking out when the woman behind the bar saw me leaving.  I shook my head at her and she didn't even say anything.  She just let me walk out.  That woman, by the way, was the same woman who was a debbie downer the first time I was at Zada Jane's.  I think she's the owner, but I think she should take herself off the schedule or become a silent partner.  In the end, I don't ever want to go back to Zada Jane's.  I truly think it is managed poorly and until that leadership changes, I urge you to look at other options before going in there."}
{"text":"We have been to Zadas a few times now on Friday and Saturday mornings and it gets better every time.  The Hasher is phenomenal, great coffee and service.  Also the biscuits with the jam they have on the table is great.  All around excellent."}
{"text":"Our first but not last visit to Zada Jane's.   Our party of 9 had an enjoyable meal with both good food and service.   We had 2 join us late and their food came out within minutes of the first order.   The staff was very attentive, coffee was always topped off, table pre-bused.  The owner was incredibly nice, giving my wife, whom she never met, flowers for her birthday.   Sadly we missed out on seeing our old friend Don Chef."}
{"text":"My Husband and I love this place. The food is consistent and the service is great. If you're looking for an upscale, clean cut hole in the wall, this is not your place. I always get the Zada Jane Basic breakfast and my husband loves the Bunny Rancheros. They have great biscuits and the Apple butter and berry jam is amazing. When it comes to dinner we always love the Ashley Farm Free Range Chicken. If they ever have Pistachio cake for dessert, get it, seriously."}
{"text":"My hubby and I was in the neighborhood after dropping our pup off at the local grooms, and wanted to grab a not to rat. After checking yelp for the local restaurants, we decided to go to Zada Janes because my husband is a big omelette fan and he especially love the build your own.  So we pull into the small ten car only parking lot which could be a pain which we realize when it was time for us to leave. Someone parked right behind us, so being the great driver that I am, had to maneuver my way out of the space. FYI, back in to the parking space instead of pulling in.   The outside of the building represents the neighborhood very well, very hip and artsy. Also the inside have local artists work, which keeps u intrigue while waiting for your food. It was semi busy, right before the noon lunch crowd. Server was nice and polite and helped us will some of the ingredients, but a little standoffish.  Anyway we both ordered build your own omelettes, his with hashbrowns, and mine with a biscuit, since I wanted to try the apple butter that heard about. Receive meal 20 mins later and was surprised by the size of the omealette. It looked delicious and was good too. My hubby, the omealette conoseiuer just thought it was ok, average. Hashbrowns were average in my opinion though.   I would definitely go back, if in the area, but I wouldn't drive across town to get there."}
{"text":"We wait for two hours today for brunch, first 45 minutes for a table which I know wasn't anyone's fault, they were just busy. But the next hour and a half I have no blues who's fault it was.. we had to ask about our food then it suddenly appears and it's cold!!!!!! We had a party of six two left without eating. The other four ate but one order was wrong. We go monthly to different places for brunch this was by far the worst experience yet! Will not be back."}
{"text":"Zada Jane's has SUCH a great vibe!  There is original artwork covering the yellow walls (most is available for purchase), the front entry is papered with flyers advertising the goings on in CLT, and the waitstaff are all funky, friendly and fun. Ask for Steven who is knowledgeable, super attentive and warm.  The food is good too! They serve breakfast all day so its all I have ever ordered. The bacon is delicious and always cooked perfectly. They also have plenty of vegetarian and vegan options. I highly recommend the East-Western, a curry infused scrambled tofu dish with peas, mushrooms, spinach, and onions. Incredibly flavorful. As for sides, the sweet potatoes are delicious, spiced with cinnamon, maple syrup, and other goodness!   Zada Jane's has an awesome outdoor patio where you can often see people drinking mimosas or Bloody Mary's with their dog leashed next to them.  The only reason I gave Zada Jane's four stars instead of five is that the food can be a bit inconsistent. I have eaten there many times and some days the food is better than others. What keeps me coming back is the ambience and service. My boyfriend and I can spend three hours here on a weekend morning, and even if its busy they never rush you to leave."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a healthy option on a beautiful day, I would highly recommend the patio at Zada Jane's!  All of their salad dressings are homemade and delicious, and I would also recommended the nachos and bloody marys!  Great location, great food, great price!"}
{"text":"The food is always good here. Pricey but good. The service; however,  has taken a turn for the worse. Having a waitress push past us to get in the door before us and then letting the door close in our faces instead of holding it for us,  sitting for 15 minutes better anyone came over to get our drink order, and then another 15 before coming back to get our food order, is being ridiculous. Waited 45 minutes for  food to come and they are not busy! This place used to be an awesome place to come for a special treat,  but lately,  the service is making it not so special."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast and lunch. Big portions and lots of options. Service is great and fast. Casual atmosphere with funky decorations. Parking can be tight but worth it. Creative combinations and flavors for breakfast food, not just your standard entrees."}
{"text":"Are they always perfect? No, but who is. They are a little quirky, a little whimsical, & have fantastic dishes! We've eaten both brunch & dinner multiple times and absolutely love Zada Jane's for exactly what it is...and on their terms. If you appreciate and like to support local, independent businesses who are doing their thing and doing their thing well, you'll love it as much as we do. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place until I stopped by on Sunday. Service was extremely slow, I sat at the bar and it seemed whenever I asked for something I was being inconvenient. Ordered a $9.70 Grande Breakfast and was overcharged twice, a total of $5.50 for the protein, meanwhile the protein is already included, according to their shady menu. When I questioned the server/bartender about it, she seemed lost and said that she had mentioned at first (SHE DID NOT). I have no problem paying for something but don't be a wise ass and try to steal from people. This was rude and unprofessional, a simple 2 eggs with a side of some nasty sausage and a coffee was $18.65. I will make sure to NEVER go near this place again."}
{"text":"This morning I was up early and decided to treat myself to brunch I settled on Zada Janes which is located in the trendy neighborhood of Plaza Midwood this place is extremely popular b/c I waited about 20 minutes before I was seated and another 20 minutes before my food came out. I decided to try the \"basic breakfast\" I chose the eggs, soysage, whole wheat toast with a pancake, with sweet potatoe bites I must say that it was delish. The serving size was just enough to fill me up without being too full the waitress was also sweet and attentive. The only cons to this place was that there was no organization as far as checking into this place for brunch and the wait was a bit long other than that it will become a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"I have no idea what the hype is all about. I have seen long lines outside of this place all the time. One day I was invited by some friends to try it out. Wish I was never invited. I got an omelette and the meat was burned and not very hot. The breakfast redskin potatoes were luke warm also. I wish the food wasn't so bland."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for breakfast and have found the food to be just OK. However, I do appreciate that they utilize local farmers and produce for their meals.   The place is pretty popular so expect a wait if you arrive after 9:00 a.m. on the weekends. They do offer coffee while you wait but I'm just not a big fan of their coffee. On my last visit (which was in Oct 2013) I ordered the blazing saddles omelet with biscuit and sweet potato hash browns. The biscuit was pretty dry and the sweet potatoes were a handful of cubed sweet potatoes. The omelet was a good size and was the best tasting part of the meal.   I'm willing to try other things on the menu but don't have high hopes. There are many other options for a solidly good breakfast in Charlotte, I wouldn't put this place on the list."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I LOVE this place for breakfast.  As others have stated, the atmosphere is funky and eclectic, and the servers are laid-back but attentive.  If we're talking breakfast, ZJ's is definitely 4-5 stars.  But I'm talking dinner today.  Sigh.  We visited Zada Jane's for dinner last night, and it was much calmer than it usually is for breakfast.  We were greeted and seated immediately, and upon reviewing the menu, I was a little disappointed.  It's primarily $7-$10 sandwiches/wraps, and entrees that cost wayyyy more than you'd expect.  To me, ZJ's has a cool diner atmosphere, yet their entrees were $15-$28 for dishes like spinach ravioli and chicken.  Yowza.  I was also keenly aware of the 90 sanitation rating when choosing my dinner.    We settled on the fried squash and zucchini cakes for an appetizer, and they were absolutely delicious, as was the tangy tzatziki that came with them.  I got Carmen's Spinach Salad for dinner, which was solid, and my fella got the Druthers Chicken sandwich, which he said was okay but a little bland.  All in all, you couldn't keep me away for breakfast, but dinner?  Eh."}
{"text":"Most of my family lives in Charlotte so every time I come visit from Chicago I make them take me to their favorite places to eat. This little restaurant is very quaint and eclectic. They staff is very friendly as long as you are perfectly happy with whatever their menu has. Trying to add or leave off something from a meal is considered almost sin.   Its definitely the neighborhood hang out so don't expect to have service that quick or food that is warm every time to you come. Expect a casual, laid back experience.   I had their veggie sandwich and \"forced theM\" to add turkey. Which I might get shunned for every time I go ... the sandwich was amazing however. They also serve breakfast all day long and it all looks good!  I recommend checkin this place out ... have a drink with some breakfast, lunch or dinner and simply enjoy the outcome!"}
{"text":"First time here and I'm not sure I will be back.  The service has been the worst I have had in Charlotte. My veggie sandwich was good, but my sweet potato browns were cold. My dining companion ordered the burger, med rare.  The burger was so well done it was dry and unappetizing. Our waitress never came back to check on us and since we were on our lunch break we ate our food even though it was not good.  I really wish properly trained staff was more important here."}
{"text":"I was visiting Charlotte for a mini vacation to visit a good friend who recently moved to the city. She heard about the brunch scene and really wanted to experience it. So after some research and reading reviews about Zada Jane's and looking at the menu we decided this was the place. My major turning point for selecting this place was because of the menu. It is different and that is what I like. (P.s my review and D G's are very similar because I am \"the friend\" in hers... hehe)  As mentioned, breakfast/brunch hours there was a long wait. About 25 minutes, so my friend and I took a stroll to the bakery down the street. After our stroll back, it was about our turn. We were seated at the first available spot, the bar. I typically avoid bar service because a. I cannot people watch, b. the seats are not so comfy, and c. it is hard to converse with the person you're with. Alas, I gave in because of hunger and said please, seat us anywhere.   Service was great. Typically you would think bar service when it is so busy isn't so great. Our guy was friendly, prompt and attentive. Our food came out within a very reasonable time of order. I was very satisfied.  Food- I ordered the Booker T which is sweet potato home fries with 2 eggs with local pork sausage cooked and placed atop of it with a homemade biscuit. Portion size was good, especially it being local eggs and pork. Overall flavor, I enjoyed the sweet potato home fries, my only gripe would be while seasoned well, I wish they were cooked a little bit more so they had a little bit more texture. It was just mushy, not even a little bit of crunchy caramelization of the sweet potato. The egg sausage was cooked to my liking. I like them JUST done, as in still soft and fluffy, but not wet. This was a godsend to my picky way of how I like my eggs cooked. My friend got essentially the breakfast salad with bacon, an overeasy egg and biscuit. The bacon was perfectly crisp, not greasy, and the greens very fresh. We were both very happy with our choices. We both had leftovers. For me, that is unusual. So that shows how filling the Booker T was.  Overall, if I visit Charlotte again, I'd go back to Zada Jane's if I was looking for not your typical brunch fair. I did not find pricing to be really overpriced. Besides, if the food is good I take no issue with paying a little bit extra. Also, the fact that they use local ingredients is always a plus to me."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch. Food and service were great! I just wish the place was a little bigger. But over all this is a great little place to go!!!!"}
{"text":"I usually think a long wait time means great food (because why would people wait for crap?) but I was wrong. We, a party of 4, waited for about 20-25 minutes. I ordered \"the gobbler\" sandwich with a side of roasted potatoes. The bread on the sandwich was stale and really dry. Super terrible. But even worse were the roasted potatoes. They were, without a doubt, cooked one day, refrigerated and microwaved when ordered. They had a dry, bouncy sponge texture. Really terrible. The passionfruit tea was delicious though. And the service was not bad either. But I will not go back and will not recommend."}
{"text":"Zada Jane's is a great option for a healthy meal out! I usually get a basic breakfast plate (eggs, bacon, sweet potato hash browns), and sometimes treat myself to one of their yummy gluten free options, such as toast or pancakes. The only downsides are the small parking lot and the slow service (service seems to be a problem more with the kitchen than the wait staff). If you are in a hurry, you'd probably want to try a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious food. breakfast all day. Tasty loose leaf teas. Indescribable jams.   Inside and outside seating. Outside is very dog friendly.  Corn hole and shuffle board.  What's not to like?  Only 4 stars because the food took a long time to come out."}
{"text":"Talking about Zada Jane's is like talking about my Mama. She's wacky, wonderful, generally lots of fun, but a little inconsistent at times. I love to go here, sit on the patio and nosh on a big honkin' Bunny Rancheros egg-stravaganza and have the fluffy homemade biscuit smothered in local apple butter for dessert. They make a mean Bloody Mary, too. There's always good rock and roll music playing, lots of local color to enjoy, and a varied menu with something for everyone.   The biggest problem with Zada Jane's, as I see it, is its popularity. Because the indoor area is on the small size, inclement or cold weather can bring everyone indoors. It has also become a destination spot for Sunday brunch, so the wait is long and service is slow. If you're chill, however, there's nothing homier or more welcoming than a visit to ZJ's. You'll leave with a full tummy and a head full of good karma."}
{"text":"I highly recommend their breakfast. I had the vegless avenger, which was amazing, but even more so, was the very best grits I've had in my entire life (and I've had my share of grits). Wonderful food, and great service."}
{"text":"Ate at Zada Janes last night with a group of girls.  The food was fabulous, our waitress was fantastic and the drinks were flowing. We had  the best time.  I can't stress how wonderful the food was.  Highly recommend Zada Janes!!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places for Sunday brunch.. or Tuesday brunch for that matter.  I love the fact that they always have breakfast no matter what time of day, but of coure, what tops it off for me are the gluten free pancakes.  These aren't dinkly little sad pancakes either, they're HUGE and I don't think I've ever left Zada's without a to-go box.  The owner is also among one of the friendliest and most helpful restaurant owners I've ever contacted.  He was happy to answer questions about products that could contain gluten while showing interest in what exactly gluten was.  They even offer gluten free toast in addition to the gluten free pancake!  I usually go with the Booker T, but everything on the menu is delicious."}
{"text":"Zada Jane's, a neighborhood hotspot and with a fun, chill atmosphere, was an awesome addition to Plaza Midwood when it opened last fall.   Like most breakfast spots in Charlotte, there can be a long wait for a table on the weekends. The servers are friendly, but it can also take a while to get your food.  If you've got the time, it's well worth the wait.  Try the fluffy french toast topped with almonds or Bunny Rancheros, a combination of fried eggs, black beans and your choice of meat, topped with cheese, guacamole, salsa verde and cilantro crema, and served with warm flour tortillas.  Zada Jane's offers some great vegetarian options, which can be a rare find in Charlotte.   The patio is perfect for people-watching on Central Avenue and you can play shuffleboard outside while you wait.  I recently tried Zada Jane's for dinner. While the dinner menu is pricier and more limited, they also had some breakfast and lunch favorites available. I got the delicious veggie sandwich and my boyfriend loved the shrimp and grits."}
{"text":"This place was definitely popping for brunch....just packed with people which was the reason for our long wait. But nonetheless they did not disappoint. Our mimosas and breakfast were all really good. The inside isn't that big but there's a lot of patio space too. We'll definitely be back during the spring for that too. The wait can be a little frustrating but it was definitely worth the wait. This place gets my brunch stamp of approval lol"}
{"text":"NOT RECOMMENDED.  We waited about an hour and a half for our food, after waiting for a table for quite some time.   Our server didn't refill our coffee or water unless we tracked her down and asked her. When our food finally came it was a mess. Nothing came out at the same time, two of us had to wait for 10 minutes while the other food came out. No apology, no explanation, nothing. Service was less than adequate to say the least. After all that, breakfast tasted like nothing.  I would have given this place one star, but the decor is fun and sitting out on the patio was nice. My husband liked his sandwich, the rest was Blech.  I definitely would NOT choose to go here again, and I would not recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Not many options for breakfast in Charlotte but this place saved the day while on tour here. Great food and service. Get the Bunny Rancheros. Worth the cab ride out"}
{"text":"At this point the food can be the best ever but the service is ridiculous. We've been sitting her for almost 1.5 hours waiting on our food! I just cant understand why. Im asking to speak to management. Service this slow only leads to a snowball effect of extremely long wait times for a table. If I wasnt starving I would just walk out!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot in plaza midwood.  Great outside patio for a sunny leisure day while inside is colorfully decorated.  Definitely a place full of regulars as the staff greeted people with hugs and a quick convo of catch up.  The menu seems to feature more of breakfast/brunch but they definitely have salads and sandwiches to offer as well.  I had a focaccia sandwich piled high with mozzarella and fresh veggies with a side of black eyed pea salad.  Very tasty!  Not the cleanest feel in there but I would definitely go back!  Rating was 95."}
{"text":"OK, so the food is good, as far as eggs and sausage and the like can be good... too bad the service is consistently horrific. Did I say horrific? I am being kind!  The wait staff moves around like bohemians on Quaaludes. Slow is an understatement. Seriously, they are too cool to care but don't even realize it. Zombie-esque really. Be prepared to wait for a table and then wait a ridiculous time for your food and then hope it's not cold or brought incorrectly, or worse, with hair on the plate! While you are waiting, make sure not to ask your server for a refill on coffee because it will never arrive, unless you get up, find her, ask again and then hope she remembers!"}
{"text":"One of my \"go-to\" spots for brunch.  My favorite is the Booker-T: sweet potato hash browns covered by frittata-style eggs & sausage which is smothered in melted cheese & green onions, biscuit on the side.  Yum!!  I've also enjoyed the unique quesadillas on occasion.  The interior is small, so plan to wait a little on weekends at brunch (especially in cooler weather).  The decor is funky and chicken-focused.  Great place!  Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Found this place while we were driving through town, the atmosphere of the restaurant is very cheerful. They got nice outside sitting and some games going on while we were there on a Saturday morning. The menu itself is kinda boring tho, for the omelette, they got either all meat or all veggies, but I LOVE they have the \"build your own omelette\". I am always changing something in the menu, so what's better than building my own, right? We wait quite some time to get our food, and I thought it was just \"ok\". The flavor was good, not too slaty, but it was way too greasy."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, I tried it once and wasn't too crazy about it. But a few months ago, I started eating breakfast here, and now it's my favorite morning spot. Good, strong coffee and delicious menu options. Now, their gravy is not so great. It's vegan, I think, and taking that into consideration, it's pretty good (and after all, they've really helped me with my biscuits & gravy addiction). You can put together any kind of breakfast you want a la carte, or they have some really tasty plates and omelets to choose from. I tried the Bunny Rancheros this morning, with sweet potatoes instead of the usual hash browns - mmm-mmm, good. I sat on the patio with my dog, and the hostess brought him a bucket of water right away - dog-friendly is always a good thing in my book. There were at least a dozen of us already waiting when they opened for Sunday brunch at 9am, so be prepared to wait for seating on the weekends."}
{"text":"Ya' know when you experience a restaurant environment at the perfect time? The ambiance fits your mood, the wait staff is great, and the food is even better?   That just happened.   I'm here on a bustling Sunday morning with my laptop at the bar. As I look around, literally everyone is smiling, including the wait staff. You can tell they love working here, and it shows.   Being a bit of an espresso snob, I was a little hesitant to order it at a restaurant like this, but I was not disappointed. My 4-shot iced espresso is fabulous.   I noticed the person next to me had a huge plate of goodness: Potatoes, meat, over medium eggs, guacamole, sour cream, tortillas... I knew I had to have it. So I ordered the Bunny Rancheros... and I haven't looked back since.   The guac is fresh, the chorizo has a complex depth of flavor, the over-medium eggs are cooked to perfection, and they even have the best hot sauce in the world already on the table: Texas Pete.   So, here are some things that would usually bother me if I was in a terrible mood. The parking is scarce- in fact, I just turned around to make sure they weren't towing my car because of my awkward parking space. It's busy and it's loud- so if you're trying to have a quiet, intimate conversation, this isn't the place.  The service does take a while, which would usually bother me, but each bite made up for each minute I waited. I also rarely ever spend a good $12 on a coffee and breakfast--I author the website BROKE & Healthy--but trust me when I say that it's worth your money.   In my opinion, Zada Jane's has lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"I go here often and I love the fact that they offer healthy, vegetarian and alternative items.  I love the \"Bunny Rancheros\" which is an omellete with guacamole, sour cream, black beams, salsa verde and potatoes.  And their apple butter and berry homemade jams are delicious!  The only thing that I dislike is the fact that when I come here on Sunday for brunch there is an hour wait.  Oh well, doesnt stop me from loving Zada Jane's!"}
{"text":"I went on Tuesday for brunch to celebrate my birthday with friends and got absolutely terrible service. One of the waitresses (with a broken arm) was extremely rude to us, we had waited about 20 minutes, going in at least 3 times to check to see if anyone was going to serve us & All of the workers made it seem like it was an inconvenience for us to be there because a server called out or something. The food was good, but I got the green salad, which was supposed to come with potatoes that I didn't get. I was so fed up with the service at that point that I didn't bother to say anything. Get your food to go because you'll probably get crappy service here! I'm a waitress at a restaurant so I understand being busy, but it was completely unacceptable and I probably won't ever come back to dine in."}
{"text":"Excellent place for brunch and lunch! This is one of the better places in Plaza Midwood to get food. They offer vegan plates for those that stay away from animal products. Plates are big and hearty no matter what you order. The biscuits are not the greatest but overall the food it is wonderful. A lot of their food is organic and local which is evident in the quality. I would recommend Zada Jane's to anyone visiting the neighborhood."}
{"text":"It's one of the newest spots in the Plaza-Midwood area, and I think it's a great addition. It's a little slow, but I've noticed that they are picking up the pace as they get more and more established. I think they might have been working out some of the kinks when it first opened.  Breakfast is great, and I also enjoy getting lunch from here. The hummus is homemade and spectacular, and I like the wide range of teas to choose from. There are tons of vegetarian options, which makes me happy (if a bit overwhelmed with all the things I can choose from. I get used to finding the one veggie possibility and ordering that one, so when there are so many choices, I'm sometimes flabbergasted.)  The atmosphere is bright and interesting, and the servers are really friendly."}
{"text":"This is a great location for breakfast/brunch, especially since they serve breakfast all day.  The lunch/dinner options look good, although I prefer breakfast any time of the day.  The portion sizes are good and I really like the prices.  You can get a good-sized meal for less than $10.  I would definitely recommend the pancakes.  Although they aren't super fluffy, they are very good."}
{"text":"I wanted brunch on a weekday, so I headed to Zada Jane's for the first time in a long time and it was absolutely delicious. My latte was on fleek. I had the Bunny Racheros with chorizo, only with scrambled eggs and sweet potato hash instead of fried eggs and home fries. It was amazing. I ate leftovers for lunch and if I had any more, I'd eat it again for dinner. Yum. :)"}
{"text":"Zada Jane's used to be one of my favorite Charlotte restaurants.  The last few times the food has been so so.    When it's on point their breakfast options are great."}
{"text":"This is as good as brunch gets. Came here around noon after a long night of partying in Charlotte, and I was in the mood for breakfast food. I ordered the Booker 's East Side Hasher (for $7.95) which included 2 eggs cooked fritatta style with sausage mixed in. There was gooey melted cheddar cheese on top with some chopped green onions for garnish. This was all layed on top of a bed of sweet potato hash, and came with a biscuit on the side. WONDERFUL. This was exactly what I wanted.  I recommend sitting at the counter-- the young lady there was so pleasant, and fun to talk to. The atmosphere made me feel comfortable, like a place locals would go to often. Now every time I'm in Charlotte I'm going to have to come here for a meal. One of the best brunches I've had in my life!"}
{"text":"Nice, neighborhood brunch place. Great location on a corner in Plaza Midwood. Cute, homey decor and lively atmosphere. Wait is a tad long, parking can be a task, service a bit spotty and prices a smidge more than I'd like.   Got the Booker T.'s East Side Hasher and it was yummy. That bed of sweet potato hash is super tasty and the frittata with soysage (soy sausage) is fantastic. This is where I discovered soysage and I am thankful.   Coffee is local and beats the socks off the crap I drink every morning, so yay!"}
{"text":"I would say this place is a great place to have a nice dinner when you don't want to get all dressed up. I had the hormone free filet.  $22.   It was decently sized cut of meat that really tasted great.  The acorn squash side was awesome.  The fresh green beans were also great. My wife had the wild mushroom ravioli $16.  First thing she noticed that each ravioli was charred.  I think the cook had that planned because much of the food was charred (to me in a good way).   Her ravioli needed to have more portion size, she was still hungry after finishing it."}
{"text":"- Long wait - Rather rude wait staff - Overall service was not that great - Food was okay, nothing really special  The food is meant to be upscale, organic with a grungy kind of twist. I had the french toast, and it was good. My bread was burned. I was close to sending it back, but it didn't have a charred taste, it was just black. Yum. The chorizo sausage is where it's at here. You'll be burping it up all day.   The best part about this place is eating outside under the umbrellas on a nice day with your dog next to you (if you have one).  We should have gone to Vivace like we usually do. Much much better!  Not recommended here at Zada Jane's."}
{"text":"I popped in for a quick lunch and took a seat on the patio.  There was only one other table with people there, not sure how busy it was inside. I settled in, was greeted promptly and asked for my drink order.  Because of the time I had before an appointment, I decided to order the hummus veggie wrap.  They were so slow in getting it to me that I had to leave hungry.  I told my server I had to move on and asked for my tea to go.  I returned afterwards because it was close and by then I was really hungry.  I sat outside again and the wrap was good, with nice greens, roasted red pepper hummus and crisp veggies. The salsa was freshly made,   No one came to refill my drink or bring the check, so I got up and went inside to pay.    Bottom line, food was good and healthy which is what I was looking for but nothing that couldn't have been done at home.  Service was very slow and inattentive.  Don't go if you're in a hurry or high maintenance."}
{"text":"Took an hour to get a table, followed by an additional 2 hrs to eat and pay for our checks. When I asked to speak with the manager due to the disappointing level of service it took her nearly half an hour to come out to our table. The manager tried to make it up to our party with a \"50 percent discount\" yet our bill was only slightly discounted. Overall, good food, terrible service. In the end Zada Jones isn't worth the hassel. You will leave annoyed that you wasted half of your Sunday afternoon on brunch."}
{"text":"I have always loved Zada Janes.  Those in the neighborhood know that they have to deal with the hiccups in the wait list and you must expect to wait on weekends.  Having only been for breakfast, I always get the Booker T with rye bread.  I need to ask them where they get their bread - it is divine.  I am not a biscuit person but if I was I am sure these are great.  The mimosa is served for $11 bucks - covers an entire bottle of champagne and a pitcher of OJ.  YUM!  Super campy inside with local artists work, junk store finds and fun memorabilia.    There is free coffee while you wait (or other special coffee drinks at the coffee bar! probably not free).  Just be patient - what you get it worth the price and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Truly unique amongst Charlotte establishments with thrifted decor, bright colors and tattoo'ed waitstaff. You would almost think you are in Austin, Portland, or Brooklyn.  The menu is your standard diner fare, tweaked a bit. Veggie options abound (I love soysage).   The wait is long during the normal busy times, like Sunday morning or lunch time, and for good reason. The place is freakin' adorable.  One visit, during a particularly busy time, my party was given free Mimosas due to the staff needing to have us move tables. This earned my eternal gratitude.  It also seems to be highly populated by very fashionable and put-together women and hotty men. Always a plus."}
{"text":"Hippie food in the South almost never turns out well, so it's refreshing to find a place that nails it.  Zada Janes is totally eclectic; both their interior and their menu reflect the quirky attitude.  I love it.  We've only been twice on two consecutive visits to Charlotte, and it's fast becoming a must-stop place. Everything I've tasted, from their soups to hummus to salads, has been delicious."}
{"text":"I've had my eye on this place for so long! Finally been in here a couple times now, now that I'm new in the neighborhood and closer. Might just come here all the time! Ha.   -First trip: Easter Sunday morning like 10-11. Sat right away outside patio. Love that they have shuffle board & corn hole right out front to play. Let's be real, their whole patio setup is nice and that's why it's always poppin'! We ordered fairly quickly. Mostly breakfast foods, but they do have some salads. It was hard to choose but we ordered:  *Booker Ts sweet potato hash!* hands down my most favorite breakfast I've had, okay top five. It's basically this delicious omelette with sweet potato hash underneath. This combo is brilliant. It's tastes heavenly. Which brought me back to round two, see second trip ). $12 *hot central coffee for $3 with refills.  *side of turkey bacon $3 (yum) *carrot cake pancakes. Um yummy! Not as sweet as it sounds. Wasn't on the menu, was a special and cost $13...prob wouldn't have spent that much on pancakes had I known that originally. But was good, just not that good if you know what I mean.   -Second trip: Saturday morning like 10:30-11. Could not just sit outside, had to see host for all seating since they were even busier. Host said 15-25 mins. More like 35 so be prepared to wait to get seated. And also for your food! The first trip was 30 min food wait once ordered. Second time almost that long. *They go slow here, no rush, go with the flow vibes* but worth the wait if you have time to do so. Both times I enjoyed my food to say the least. (I had booker T for food, a iced latte second trip $4? Good!)   Love me some Zada Jane's. Prob gonna be my fav brunch in my new neighborhood. Thanks Zj"}
{"text":"Went to Zada's when I was in Charlotte this past weekend.  It is a nice funky cafe with great breakfasts.  They have a version of huevos rancheros called bunny rancheros that is delicious.  I ordered the East Side Hasher - and it was yummy .  They serve sweet potato hash browns and have quick and friendly service.  If you are in Charlotte and looking for a good breakfast/brunch head here.  Make a reservation or arrive early this place gets busy and has a line out the door."}
{"text":"Love this place! I always leave full and with a to go box! I appreciate their options of non-pork breakfast items and the food comes out fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Went there today for a simple brunch and took us (2 people) 25 minutes to be seated. After we were seated we ordered our food and exactly 1 hour and 10 minutes later our waiter told us that our food is almost ready. 10 minutes after that she said they are really backed up in the kitchen. Needless to say we spent a total of 2 hours in there and walked out with no food. We were extremely disappointed. Do not go here!!!"}
{"text":"Put name in at 10:30, sat at 11:20...not a bad wait for Mothers Day...have waited longer here.  That is the expectation. We gat being said, we put our order in at 11:30...it's now 12:35 and still haven't received food.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!! Again we expect to wait but this is outrageous...over an hour AFTER placing our order.  Have been here and enjoyed it many times over the years. Likely to never come back."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. The service is spotty at times. Not the place to go if you are in a rush to be somewhere soon. Great if you have the time to sit back, eat good food and enjoy people watching."}
{"text":"You simply must try the pancakes! They are amazingly delicious and \"light and fluffy\" just as they claim.  I ventured to Zada James with three others on Saturday following a 5k. I was famished. I was delighted that we didn't have to wait for a table. I was not delighted that I had to move my vehicle from the Grease place across the street (they tow) and that Zada's didn't come with a whole lot of parking options (spaces, that is). However, after I was properly parked and coffeed up... I ordered the Basic Breakfast with pork sausage, scrambled eggs, grits (very very creamy) and the biscuit. Being a biscuit maker myself--I wasn't excited about THEIR biscuit, but it wasn't bad. Others at the table ordered the pancakes (DELICIOUS, I was sad I didn't order these but I did offer to finish off my friends--who let me, yay), the sweet potato hashbrowns (good, but SWEET--you have been warned), and the Bunny Rancheros (colorful, looked and smelled good, I didn't taste these but he seemed to enjoy his meal as his plate was clean afterwards...  I will definitely go back and try other things from the menu--especially some of their sandwiches and OF COURSE the pancakes! This place has outdoor seating as well as indoor in a very eclectically decorated space with colorful walls and really \"cool\" (ha) ceiling fans."}
{"text":"With Zada Jane's being one of the few brunch-type places in the Plaza Midwood area, this place always has a LONG wait.  It's not because the food is amazing, it's because the service is so slow...everywhere.  The servers are often nowhere to be found, and one time I sat at the bar and everyone was frustrated because the person assigned to this area would be completely inattentive for 15-20 minutes at a time.  It also took us about 45 minutes to get our food once the order was put in, which is way too long.  Then I got my Omelette (got the special of the day with buffalo meat) and it was pretty bad.  The eggs were beyond overcooked and there was literally orange grease all over my plate seeping out of the omelette.  I had them remake it and the second one was just as bad.  The first time I went, they also messed up my order and didn't give me a breakfast burrito.  I did have a salad there one time, which was good.  Maybe that's a sign that I should stay away from their breakfast food???  It's clear that the people are working hard (both servers and kitchen staff), but this place just can't handle the volume with the current staff.  I would only go here if you're looking to have an incredibly leisurely, catch-up breakfast with a friend and you're not in a rush.  A lot of people like this place, so I say give it a try!  You just won't see me there anymore...third time was NOT a charm."}
{"text":"Loved this place !!! :-) Fresh, organic even gluten free! You will have to wait for a table tho- totally worth it! Service is fast and the food is delicious :)"}
{"text":"I like the location & idea behind Zada Janes.  But, why is the gravy different EVERY time I order it.  Consistency is important when you try to order something that you like & it comes out tasting totally different than the last time!  Also, they never change their menu!!!  They could have much better food.  This place is merely average..."}
{"text":"Zada Jane's is an adorable neighborhood cafe.  I've heard about it for years since my sister and her fiance go there often for brunch.  They love it so much that they named their dog after it!  Well, recently, I finally got to try it out for myself!    Molly S. and I wandered in for some afternoon brunch on a weekday so it wasn't as busy as I bet it probably is on a weekend.  She ordered the Bunny Rancheros.  It seems that this is her favorite dish to order.  She also had a latte and the waitress was so cute when she said she tried to make a really cool design in it, but it didn't quite turn out how she envisioned it.    I ordered the Grande Quande which is the Basic Breakfast, plus one, big fluffy pancake.  What does The Zada Jane 28205 Basic Breakfast encompass?  Two happy eggs, choice of one protein, one carb, plus toast or a TLC bisquit.  Molly advised me right away to go for the biscuit over toast.  So I ordered my two eggs over medium, their Local Grateful Growers sausage, Sweet Potato Browns, and the biscuit.  The pancake was the perfect size and they got my eggs just right medium -- a little run, but not too much.  The sausage had a little spicy kick to it, but just right.  The sweet potatoes were good, but seemed to lack flavor so when heated them up at home later on I added some butter and a little brown sugar to fix 'em up.  The biscuit also seemed to lack some flavor.  I thought it was a little hard too so maybe it had been sitting out a while.  Overall, I was very happy with my meal too.    Our waitress was super sweet and friendly and the decor of this cafe is a delight.  I also love that they have local art for sale, a patio for when it's warm, and their own Zada Jane cornhole boards.  I would definitely go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Hostess did a horrendous job seating people. People were pushing their way in and seating themselves. There was no order at all. We will not be back anytime soon. Hopefully it will be resolved."}
{"text":"Great local diner in Plaza  Midwood.  I was here for a late breakfast last week and loved the food.  The service once seated was absolutely great although we had a rough start.  I'm not going to grill the staff for skipping our name on the wait list because I know it happens and they obliged immediately once they noticed the problem.  I had a breakfast burrito full of delicious egg, sour cream, and spinach.  The biscuit on the side was a perfect companion.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Relaxing, has a patio, and the food is great! Need I say more?"}
{"text":"It's love at first bite, and sometimes sight. (I met my fiancé at Zada Jane's 3 years ago!)   ZJ'a is the perfect chill getaway for brunch, lunch or dinner. The Bunny Rancheros are a must-try... roasted potatoes, over-easy eggs, queso fresco, guac, sour cream, black beans, and your choice of protein. Warm tortillas on the side with a mimosa or two. The mushroom ravioli is the jam too.   I've never enjoyed the Bloody Mary's here though."}
{"text":"45 MIN WAIT FOR THIS ?!? Please tell me the process in the kitchen ?!? Not eating this shit you guys can do better . Thanks for making this Mother's Day wonderful & you guys are not even busy so that's not an excuse   And tell your waitress to act like she likes her job or tell her to get her ass home and not to come in , having unhappy employees means bad experience granted you most likely won't respond looking at these reviews and you guys barley respond . But you have to fix this or it will get fixed also next time I order a tea take one sip tell the waitress I did not like it and exchange for a water don't charge me please thanks for ruining MOTHERS DAY FOR us !! good job guys"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to give Zada Jane a one star. I was so excited about experiencing this place after my friends had been texting me all morning to join them for brunch. Though they had finished by the time I arrived I still wanted to give the place a try. After reading the yelp reviews, looking at al the yummy Yelp photos I as totally in!   After walking the Juneteenth festival I walked over and saw no one was sitting in the patio but there were LOTS of receipt books laying out from previous guest. {not good someone could have stolen these receipts and or cash if any were left. I use to work in finance bank fraud so my red flags went up}. I went inside to ask if they would be servicing the patio. The lady said yes and someone would be right with me, and that I could select and table I wanted. I did just that facing the festival.   After waiting for 15minutes and no one coming out I decided to go inside to see what the hold up could be. Just as I was walking through the door a server comes running out. Apologizing that she was just heading out. I said it was ok, and told myself I would stay and order because I was extremely hungry. She provided me with a menu and a glass of water. I asked if she could give me about 4minutes to review the menu and I would be ready. I SPECIFICALLY asked for only 4minutes because I was so hungry and it had already taken 15minutes for someone to acknowledge me. Another 15 minutes go by and at that point I had enough. I left everything in the table including the untouched water and walked away. Not sure how long after that it took for them to notice I was gone but. I'm truly upset I didn't get to experience this place. The reviews in here are great, my friends swear by it and the $14 bottle of champagne for brunch, and how the servers know who they are as soon as they walk in and fills them with drinks. So unfortunate that I did not receive that same service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch places in Charlotte. Awesome ambience, especially on the patio on a nice warm day. The wait staff is super friendly. The pancakes are some of the best I've had and the Blazing Saddles dish is by far one of my most favorite breakfast dishes ever!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular breakfaster at Zada's during the week.  Weekends are kind of scary, but that's usually a good sign, I think.  I get together with some colleagues here once a month for consultation and communion and we wouldn't go anywhere else.  I've only had lunch or supper here maybe once each, so I can't comment too much on either.  As for breakfast, however, this is where Zada's shines.  My favorite is the french toast, which is two thick and light pieces of brioche style bread, and is served with an orange zest butter.  I also love the bunny rancheros with chorizo, although they require a bib or a trip to the shower afterwards.  Think a pile of home fries and black bean with two over medium eggs, queso, sour cream, and guacamole on top with two flour tortilla.  I have recently been getting the east side hasher, which is sweet potato home fries with a meat (chorizo again, for me) and covered in scrambled eggs and cheese.  The biscuits are lovely.  They serve Grateful Growers products to support the local farmers.  All are delicious.  The only thing I've ever had that I didn't like was the pancakes, which I found heavy, although I've only tried them the one time.  The ambiance is funky and fun.  The music is eclectic and ranges from torch to rap.  The staff are helpful and friendly in a homey way.  There is local art for sale on all of the walls.  The prices are on the upper side of reasonable, but I'm willing to pay for creativity and to keep fun places in the neighborhood.  The best breakfast I've found in Charlotte (after pining for years for Lynn's Paradise Cafe in Louisville)."}
{"text":"Fast and Friendly service Great Customer service Healthy, Local, Allergy Friendly options Best Brunch Location in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love it here. I love central ave/plaza midwood area and it wouldn't be the same without Zada Jane's.   The place is amazing for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My favorite dish is the breakfast salad. It has tofu, eggs, onion, greens, and an amazing balsamic dressing. The nachos are also really good.   Make sure to get there earlier than expecting to eat. It always seems to busy. :D"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this places food more. I was very disappointed. I'm not a master chef home chef, but I make better breakfast at home. I like to try the basics to see if places excel at those. Unfortunately the 28205 breakfast was lackluster. You can get better sustainable turkey sausage from the grocer.   The atmosphere is nice though. It's very relaxed and calm. The staff is sweet and helpful. There's a nice outside space that is always packed on sunny mornings. It's definitely hipster lol, but definitely cool. The mimosas are delish and was the saving grace. I'd pass and just cook at home next time.  Edit: I ate the biscuit and it was delicious. The jam was pretty bomb too. I think maybe because it was cold inside and I had to rush to eat my food made the experience less enjoyable. A lot of people come here. I can't imagine that many people have bad tastebuds."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite breakfast spot!!!  I really love their selections of egg plates. Oh my, and their sweet potato hash browns!! Wow.  Taste: Amazing/ Quality: Amazing/ Service: awesome!! Prices: super.  Not expensive and you don't sacrifice anything for the price.  Break out of the norm and go eat breakfast here."}
{"text":"The food was super yuuummm.  Great variety and big portions.  Everyone was very friendly.  The was a nice ambience.  I would definitely recommend coming here. The only drawback is they close early on some days."}
{"text":"We had the best breakfast at Zada Janes this morning ... April Fools!!!  In reality, all they were serving up today were attitudes!  On a beautiful spring Saturday morning in April they had three total servers and the patio wasn't open. On the weekends you can expect bad, slow service and cold food.   However if you can go during the week at a non busy breakfast time, the food and service at the bar, is on point. The Bunny Rancheros is the best breakfast in town."}
{"text":"The Bunny Rancheros are the stuff of dreams. The menu is huge, something for everyone. The food is really great, but the wait is very long and service is slow."}
{"text":"My first time here: Slow. The time it took my sandwich to come out of the kitchen was too long. Then the cook gave my lunch to wrong person.  Person didn't notice it wasn't his order and began eating my lunch... When server realized something was wrong it became sort of a joke. (That didn't include me.) Person says \"Somebody put food down and i ate it.\" Server was kind of like \"oh no big deal - yours will be out in a while\".  No apology.  It would have been no big deal if it were the weekend and wine was involved but it was lunchtime on a Tuesday.   Food-wise, the Druthers Clucker sandwich was very good, the black eyed pea salad OK but not great.  Zada Jane's is a really cool place I just wish I felt a little more appreciated."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast outside.  The biscuits were fresh and delicious and the gravy was the best I ever had.  My server was really friendly too."}
{"text":"Popped in today fior a late breakfast/early lunch while in the neighborhood.   Random artsy vibe...lots to look at inside (still trying to figure out the picture that seemed to be an evil rooster-type creature with long stick legs).  Bar area was full of people peacefully reading the newspaper or sipping coffee.   Decided to get sausage biscuit for my daughter (local sausage) and gravy biscuit for myself (and OJ and coffee).  BEST SAUSAGE EVER. EVER.  Coffee was fine, biscuit was fine. Interesting people to watch.   Kind of expensive. Ouch."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I am so happy I did. This place is one of my favorite brunch places in all of Charlotte!  Atmosphere: eclectic, artsy, and small but efficient. The space is tiny, so expect a wait, especially for weekend brunch, but they move through the list quickly and it's better during the summer since their space is essentially doubled by their patio.  Coffee: OMG their holiday mocha... has gingerbread and peppermint in there with the mocha and espresso. Just do it. No regrets.  Food: I order the Booker T's East Side Hasher pretty much every time. Sweet potato has browns, scrambled eggs, and smothered in cheese. Yes, yes, yes. Biscuit on the side is a bit dry for my taste, but I'm always so full from the rest of the meal that it doesn't matter. The meal is large, come hungry, or plan to share.  Service: Very kind servers and good at what they do. I've never had an order messed up or someone fail to refill my water."}
{"text":"Yesterday I went to Zada Janes for the third time for brunch and again was not disappointed. First of all I love the atmosphere, because there is so much to look at and take in. The food is very fresh and tasty. This most recent time I went with the simple Zada Janes breakfast. Eggs cooked perfectly to order, a delicious melt in your mouth biscuit with homemade jams, tasty turkey sausage and delicious herb roasted potatoes, what more could A person ask for. In the past I have tried the nachos, amaretto French toast, and the Brooker Ts East Side Hash. All of which were very tasty. Service is always friendly, but not always fast, which is the only downfall.but once you get a biscuit and load it with jam you will forget all your worries and sigh a sigh of pure delight. See for yourself I dare you."}
{"text":"WOW....is all I can say.  I can now say that I have had the WORST service I have ever ever ever experienced tonight....sadly, our table was not alone.    Slow, slow, and pitiful.  Seriously, my friend was timing, bc she warned us that they are always slow  30 minutes from sit down to order taking.  Food took another half-hour to get out.  Food was tepid at best.  Then came the paying debacle.  It took 50 minutes and that is no exaggeration from when we asked for the check for us to leave.  This is after they ran our bills wrong, were simply befuddled on how to do a void.     I was warned they were always pretty slow, but this was a record for me.    I would also say that none of the other servers were too interested in help this poor thing and they were equally moving slower than molasses, not thinking of the greater good of the restaurants image.    My friend left nothing.   I'm the patron saint of all servers after doing it for years, but this is the 1st time I've never left at least 10%.  $1 was all I could muster up on a $37 ticket for 2 people.    I guess the manager came out after all of this mess to see what she could do to have us come back.  My friend asked for her money back since she did ask, and she said she couldn't do that but offer a gift certificate.  That wouldn't work since she won't be back.  I won't be back, which is a shame, bc I like the place and my sandwich was good.  BTW they charged $4 for a glass of chocolate milk for a kid...WTF?"}
{"text":"Service was a little slow, but they were busy when we came on Saturday. I got the bacon, egg, and cheese on a biscuit and the single pancake. I think the pancake had cinnamon in it, which I loved! The biscuit was delicious too; my only complaint was that the egg seemed like it was deep-fried or something. Next time I'd just ask for it over easy. My sister got the bunny rancheros and seemed to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"One of the best brunch spots in Charlotte. Get here early to avoid a long wait. So so good!!"}
{"text":"My best home slice, Elizabeth A., has a total ZJ girl boner for this place and I can tell why! A homey, ecletic interior spills out onto a room patio for outdoor dining, and inbetween are servers who you can tell really enjoy their job. And not just serving, but working at Zada Jane's.  I have found this to be a great go-to spot not just for brunch/lunch but also for meetings. The 10am/11am sweet spot that's after breakfast but before the lunch rush M-F is a great time to stop in and having coffee with a friend, talk business over tea or read a book with some free range scrambled eggs.  Highly recommended are the bunny rancheros (Elizabeth's review is worth checking out for the full low-down on those bad boys!), ala carte eggs and toasts (cheap, yummy breakfast!), and the salads with tofu options.  A great addition to the 'Wood - swing by and see what we're loving!"}
{"text":"Um, there was HAIR in my sandwich... And my coffee came out cold both times. I will never, ever return."}
{"text":"This place always has a line on Saturday mornings, probably because it is great hangover food or sober up food for the inebriated. Maybe it was on a Sunday morning. My memory is fuzzy. The lines aren't terribly long and it is always a good place to meet with friends or make new friends in line. I really like the shuffle board option also. It's another great way to pass the time while you wait. We ended up leaving before our table was called, but I read somewhere that the food is really awesome. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for breakfast food, staff never apologized, food was mediocre at best"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It has a funky atmosphere.  I like the non-matching coffee cups from all over the place.  I think the food always tastes nice and fresh no matter what I order.  I always get breakfast so I can't really speak for the lunch items.  You can bring your dog too and sit out on the patio.  There is also a shuffleboard if you are into that. :)"}
{"text":"Brunch food, is always fun food; always social food.  If you're looking for quality and affordability, you're at the right spot. Zada Jane's Corner is my pick for a relaxed Sunday brunch. While they have large outdoor area for when it is nice (isn't it always nice in Charlotte?!) they also have large indoor restaurant.  My friend got the hummus frummus salad, and I had the Blazing saddles. We opted for the coffee and we both left satisfied. However, If you like, you can treat yourself to mimosa or a manly man-mosa.  Four Yelps"}
{"text":"I don't see all the craze with this place. Service is very slow and our server was about half asleep. Food took a solid 45 minutes and was mediocre at best and cold. I will never go back."}
{"text":"I really do love the food here but the rest of the experience just makes me never want to go back.  I've been several times where I've had to wait much much too long for my food. Even at lunch in the middle of the week when the restaurant was only half full. But last night took the cake.  We came in and since there were no free tables, we sat at the bar. We ordered some sodas and then our food pretty quickly. I had to be at work an hour and a half later so we definitely thought there'd be plenty of time but after 45 minutes without getting our food, I was getting very anxious. I finally asked a waitress to check on our food and I told her I had to leave soon to go to work. She kind of dilly-dallied into the kitchen and came back out and told us that our waitress would let us know what was going on.  Our waitress came back out, did some stuff on the computer, cleaned some plates, and all while I was just staring at her waiting for an answer. Finally she comes to me and says that the kitchen lost a few tickets or I guess they thought our food had already come out or some lame answer. I told her to forget it because I just couldn't wait any longer. She said \"well don't worry about the drinks.\" Thanks...if I had known I was going to get free drinks instead of dinner, I would've ordered a bottle of wine. I would've really appreciated a gift certificate or something.  Now, I have worked in many restaurants and I understand things happen. But she really should've noticed after 20 minutes that we have not had our food and checked on it herself. The fact that I had to ask and then there was no sense of urgency or sincere remorse really irked me. I ended up going down to Fuel for a quick slice of pizza and inhaled it before work. Not what I had looked forward to doing right before 6 hours on my feet serving people drinks.  I think I'll just be officially done with this place. Unfortunately."}
{"text":"I've honestly been a few times to Zada Janes and I have to say... mehh, it's alright.  I've taken family from out of town thinking that the wait will be worth it...  not so much. It's a nice place to go, but don't rush to get there and wait, I personally don't feel it's worth it.  The price is affordable and reasonable.  The staff is decent, not overwhelmingly friendly the times I've gone and one of the visits we had to hunt down the waitress to get the bill.  The food is fair, with a great selection of omelets and vegan/vegetarian friendly dishes, which always makes me smile :).  I would recommend this place, but on your time, not theirs!  Go when it's slow!"}
{"text":"I went here within the last year. I don't remember anything about it. Probably not a good sign."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a complainer, but brace yourselves because that is exactly what I am about to do. Me and my husband decided to stop in for a quick breakfast last Thursday. We had been here a few times before and love the atmosphere so we figured it would be a quick place to stop in before we had to work. We got there and were waved to find a seat wherever, which isn't out of the usual so we sat in the last booth by the kitchen door. We sat for at least 5-6 minutes before we were even acknowledged, got drink orders, etc. Now me and my husband both worked in the restaurant industry, so we understand, sometimes there is more going on than meets the eye.  So silently we waited another 7-8 minutes for our drinks to arrive (two coffees and an orange juice, in the morning those should be pretty standard) We placed our order when she brought us back our drinks and this is where the fun begins. So we both ordered standard menu options, no substitutions, nothing crazy. We sat there waiting for our food, watching our surroundings as we do everywhere and it seemed like the servers were more into their little server drama than actually giving us service. There was a girl with a UFO tattoo who couldn't stay off here phone. Even went to where the bathrooms are and decided to make a phone call. When she realized a guest was approaching the restrooms she immediately went into the woman's restroom and made the guest wait outside of it until she was done talking so the guest could use it. Ridiculous. The food runner looked like she had poor hygiene and honestly didn't want her touching my food and I am NOT the kind of person that typically thinks that. But when it look like hair hasn't been washed in weeks, and I can see underwear through thin leggings, its pretty gross (to me). It was honestly just awful. And to make things worse, we watched two tables come in after us, get their drinks, food, and almost be ready for their bills before our food even came to the table. We waited about 45 minutes before my husband told our \"waitress\" that we couldn't wait any longer and we just wanted to pay for our drinks otherwise we would be late for work. You could tell the server wasn't even fazed by this at all, she said \"well you don't have to pay for your drinks\" OKAY?? you think the 5 dollars in drinks is what were disputing??? Like that's the best you can do? not \"oh I'm so sorry, let me rush that and get it to go\", or \"let me take care of breakfast next time\", or even \"let me go grab my manager\"! Absolutely ridiculous. While we were for our food we knew something had went wrong with it because of the number of servers looking over at our table. but NO ONE SAID A WORD. That is the industry your in. Service. if you cant provide it, go bag groceries down the street. I will definitely not ever go back here. If I were the owners of this establishment, I would go into damage control mode quick. Because you don't want the executive chef of a major charlotte restaurant bad mouthing your restaurant........"}
{"text":"Love this place! They are the only place I know of that serves brunch until 5 on Sundays, so it's the perfect spot for a late weekend meal. Half price bottles of wine on Sundays as well so you can go with a group and make your own mimosas!"}
{"text":"I've been to Zada Jane's countless times and was surprised that I hadn't reviewed it yet. It's one of those eclectic, trendy restaurants that both the young and old patronize faithfully. Their TLC biscuits are incredible--slightly crunchy on the outside, pillowy and airy on the inside, and when you break it open and see all the steam pouring out, you want to throw the whole thing in your mouth. I usually top mine with the herb gravy with soysage, which is phenomenal.   I've also been there for dinner and had no complaints about their mushroom ravioli. It was fresh, flavorful, filling, and left me wanting more--just like any good meal should.  If you're in the Charlotte area, please go to Plaza Midwood and check this place out. You may have to wait a few moments to get in, but it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Food was great service not so good! The Larger table next to us drinks order was taken before us table of two. Waiter never came to refill any drinks."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after a friends recommendation. We sat at the bar and enjoyed the ambiance.  Pretty cool stuff all over the place like the rooster painting and figurines as well as the framed record covers.    It wasn't crowded but there was only one waitress and a bartender that was also waiting some tables, so service was a bit slow but they were super friendly and helpful.    I got the vegan soup that was described as, \"vegetable soup\" and was surprised by the intense cinnamon aroma.  It was a generous serving but wasn't  impressed by the flavor, or lack there of, aside from the overwhelming cinnamon that seemed to blanket all of the actual vegetable flavor.  I doused it in hot sauce in attempt to over ride the cinnamon to no avail. However, the house salad with homemade tomato vinaigrette dressing was great!  And my partner in crime thought the meklenburger and mashed potatoes were tasty!"}
{"text":"Came here 2x on Easter weekend while visiting my brother and sister in law. The first time it was just my fiance and I and the second with our entire family.   1st experience: Slow service, gave my fiance real turkey sausage not soysauge (know the difference because got the correct stuff the next day) - the meals were good, but nothing to write home about  2nd experience: Great service, delicious bloody Mary's (not too heavy) and awesome meal. I had the springs breakfast salad with soysauge. The herb biscuits and gravy were great too! Everyone loved their meal!!   Will definitely be back since it's within walking distance to my brother's house! :)"}
{"text":"The Vegless omelet is awesome! If you want great food made with the freshest ingredients this is your place. If you'd like to get right in and out try going midweek. The service is always good and the wait staff is always friendly.  Parking is sometimes an issue during busy times. Otherwise I would've certainly given them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I love to eat here for breakfast and brunch. The service is consistently good service and consistently tastes the same from visit to visit. My favorites are Bunny Rancheros, Pancakes, and the Blazin' Saddles Omelette.  Get there early or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I visited yesterday with some friends and had a wonderful experience. The menu was unique and seemed to have something to offer for everyone. Everything was delicious and fresh and the atmosphere was friendly. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to try the vegless avenger. It was one of the better omelettes that I've had in Clt. The best part of the meal was the sweet potato hash. I'd go back just for that. My only complaint was it took almost an hour to get my food from the time I ordered but I wasn't in a hurry so no big deal."}
{"text":"I'd only ever eaten here for breakfast in the past. When we hit 1-hour plus waits at Pizza Peel and Workman's last night, we wandered in to Zada Janes. While there was no wait at 8:30pm and my party of 6 was seated immediately, the place wasn't dead either.   Their dinner menu offers a nice variety -- everything from $8-$12 sandwiches and salads to $20-$30 entrees. Their beer and wine list is average. They had 2 local beers on draught and lots more in bottles/cans. Because we were feeling a little feisty and you can never go wrong with bubbles, we went with a bottle of prosecco. I ordered the green mind melt (a veggie sandwich) with Mac & Cheese as the side. The sandwich lacked seasoning and was just ok (maybe a C+) but the Mac & cheese was really good (solid A). I mean, the Mac had bacon. It had to be good, right?! The table shared chicken and shrimp nachos. Both yummy! The addition of zucchini and squash was a unique touch and made us all feel a little better about killing two plates of nachos.   Zada Janes has some stiff competition in the Plaza Midwood area but I remain a fan, especially when facing a long wait at other spots nearby. It's a good, neighborhood joint. Wait staff are super friendly and personable. The atmosphere is laid back and relaxed."}
{"text":"Awesome little hippie joint.  Staff was super attentive.  Our server Steven was great.  He made sure we were well cared for.  I had the best omelette in my 52 years."}
{"text":"I love this colorful, funky, eclectic diner that reminds me of a place I used to frequent in Laguna Beach, CA back in the 70s, and that's why I gave 4 stars, but seriously the food, although the ingredients are great quality, is just so so for flavor, prep and presentation and, although the servers are friendly and seem to be efficient, we usually experience a long wait for our food. But, despite what is lacking here, the food is healthy and it is a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Really great variety. I've only had bfast here a couple times but it's been great. Gets very busy and no reservations so expect a wait on the weekend."}
{"text":"Bunny Rancheros with chorizo!!! Delicious! The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is the servers are not consistent"}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with Zada's. The food is always great and the servers are very friendly, but...BUT the service is so damn slow it's almost a joke. Today (a Monday) we showed up at 10 am and there were no tables left inside. We were told we could sit outside at a table on the back side of the patio. We sat. We waited. We waited some more. We waited a little longer. At 10:35 we decided to go have breakfast somewhere else. I get it, they are popular and busy. But, they knew we were there and still never even bothered to bring us menus. We are pretty much regulars here and even when they only have 3-4 tables filled we have waited over 30 minutes to get our food. It's always delicious and every employee is nice, but I don't always have 2 hours for a meal."}
{"text":"Zada Jane's is such a Plaza Midwood gem. First, the service is awesome. So welcoming and kind. They went out of their way to set up and umbrella for us on their beautiful patio so that we could have some shade.   Their food is homemade and delicious. You can tell the flavors are well thought out and impeccably planned. I had the nachos (yum!) and my mom had the chicken salad wrap. It took a little bit for the food to come out, but it was worth the wait. Will definitely be returning!  I can't wait to come back for all day breakfast!"}
{"text":"I will be the first to admit that the customer service can be questionable & inconsistent. Combine that with the often long wait times, practically non-existent parking, and the crazy price for a plain, old cup-o-coffee, I can understand how some folks aren't fans of this quirky spot.   With that being said, I still love Zada Jane's. I just know now what to expect going there. I've only ever eaten here for breakfast, so my experiences are based on that alone. I love the sweet potato hashbrowns. The Belvedere Omelet is almost always good (the one time it was made incorrectly, the server made me feel bad for pointing out their error, never offered to make me a new one, and balked when I asked for a discount after I ate way less than half of it - that's an example of the questionable customer service we've gotten here). However, their biscuits are really good and the berry jam & apple butter they have on the tables are ah-may-zing. Those condiments alone are reason to dine here, which is often what we're craving when we brace ourselves for the drive, the parking lot, the long wait & the so-so service, but for some reason, we keep coming back for the unique and usually yummy food choices."}
{"text":"There is a lot to like here, in general it is a nice popular dive that has good food, including some solid vegetarian options.   Atmosphere:  It's a bit of a dive, but not a dive that has fully dove. Definitely has that feel that the entire neighborhood gets together here and the out of towners join in as well.   Staff:  Everyone I've met here is very friendly and helpful. We always get solid recommendations. We also get seated fairly quickly considering how busy it gets.   Food:  The food is always satisfying. I'm a southern boy, raised on southern food, on buscuits, gravies, cheeses, fried everything. Zada Jane's brings it proper with nice and satisfying versions of southern food that are not greasy and some have a sense of being healthy as well. As a vegetarian, the alternatives are great, as a previous meat-eater, I am always tempted to get some of the creative meat dishes.   Cost: Cost is on par with other restaurants in this genre. Affordable and very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place was packed when we arrived. Always a good sign. The decor is funky and eclectic. We didn't want to wait for a table so we grabbed a seat at the bar. Food was fantastic but a bit pricey for breakfast. I suppose the extra cost is to cover the extra expense of having fresh local meat.  Pros- good food outdoor seating with room for pups friendly staff  Cons- Tiny gravel parking lot, only room for about 10 cars. Not enough for the amount of business they get. But Charlotte parking is always a nightmare right?"}
{"text":"Came here because I heard they have a GF menu. Unfortunately most of their gluten free items have dairy in them too. Not a lot of GF options to begin with and even fewer if you avoid dairy as well. The staff doesn't seem to be trained either and it made me very nervous to eat here. I didn't get sick but the server didn't even know if they had a separate prep area.   Other than that the food was ok but a little expensive for what it was. Especially considering how long we waited for a table."}
{"text":"I think this is a solid choice for breakfast.  The french toast was much better than the pancake.  The pancake was large enough to share but not very moist.  I wouldn't get that again.  The eggs were really good.  The staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Had my sis, who is a local resident, take Mom, my nephew, and me here for our last meal in Charlotte on 4/28.  Sis has never eaten here and was surprised that such a place existed.    Nice atmosphere.  Slow and impatient service (and I didn't even barrage her w/ questions like I normally do), with perhaps 1/8, or less, of restaurant capacity.  Food was good though, and they were as follows:  Mom and sis shared w/ nephew- Bunny Rancheros ($8.95): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aBLx9JlAMq_AuW6VAImSwg?select=0QyTXrou9KTH477vIOxaWg#0QyTXrou9KTH477vIOxaWg  A pic of my nephew's side of pancakes http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aBLx9JlAMq_AuW6VAImSwg?select=WaeabUhvm3nHqN9G4nLH8A#WaeabUhvm3nHqN9G4nLH8A  \"a bed of sweet potato hash browns topped with two Happy Eggs frittata style with your choice of local Grateful Growers pork sausage, turkey sausage, or soysage,then covered with melted cheddar cheese and green onions - choice of toast or TLC biscuit\"  Yours truly- Grande Quande ($8.95), which is The Zada Janer 28205 Basic Breakfast ($6.95), plus a pancake: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aBLx9JlAMq_AuW6VAImSwg?select=CfqNtH_Bj68CHWmYukYs0g#CfqNtH_Bj68CHWmYukYs0g  \"two Free Range happy eggs any style with choice of one protein,and one carb, plus toast or TLC biscuit\"  The rancheros was nicely presented, and enjoyed by all three!  I must note, however, that both sister and Mom did NOT enjoy their cups of fair trade coffee, which they claimed tasted too bitter and stale.  I requested my eggs over medium, but they arrived well-done.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aBLx9JlAMq_AuW6VAImSwg?select=jnIy6l_IkpBwSMFLhBfTQw#jnIy6l_IkpBwSMFLhBfTQw  My protein choice was some wonderful country bacon (crispy pan-fried smoky pieces of ham sliced very thick!), and two small gluten-free pancakes that took the place of the bread and my side order of pancake.  These pancakes were tasty, albeit very greasy, a fact that wasn't evident until I unwrapped some leftovers to have on the plane a few hours later, which ended up in the garbage.  I really enjoyed the side of sweet potato hash- a tasty alternative to regular potatoes, which I am not able to consume anymore these days.  Overall, we enjoyed the food, but not the wait."}
{"text":"LOVE this little gem!  I feel like alot of breakfast places serve up the same rote pancake, eggs  blah blah boring boring.... coming from Chicago with some pretty high standards for food I dont like to be bored.  Zada Janes was fabulous!  I got the special pancake -banana pecan and it was really special- the pancakes were perfectly cooked, a nice crisp on the outside.  The latte was great and the herb sausage buiscuit and gravy delicious. All other restaurants need to take not and be a little inventive with their menu. Cute casual vibe and a super nice staff, I will sooo be back Zada Jane."}
{"text":"I sat outside here, which has a nice area to sit in the sun and faces Central Ave. I love that there is a big space to sit in the sun. Our hostess got our drinks, but it took a while to see our waitress--which was odd because they weren't busy. I was there around 3:30 in the afternoon. I got the nachos, which were good but my chips were buried and soggy, so I had to get more. I love that they had grilled zucchini and squash on them. My friend also got the nachos and hers didn't have guacamole on them so she had to order a side of that as well. They were out of the beer I wanted and our waitress wasn't sure if they had sour mix to make a margarita. Thankfully they did. Overall the service and food were mediocre. They get 3 stars for having a good atmosphere and friendly service despite their setbacks."}
{"text":"Before moving to the South, I never really cared for the breakfast options available at most restaurants; however, ever since visiting Asheville, I've reset my standard when it comes to breakfast/brunch restaurants. While Charlotte has a ton to offer, not much can measure up to the phenomenal selection available in Asheville.  Zada Janes made me forget I was in Charlotte.    Between my wife and I we had Bacon/Egg/Cheese biscuit, the Blazing Saddles Breakfast Burrito, and Sweet Potato/Chocolate Chip pancakes.  All were delicious and reminded us how much we love the South.  I really doubt there is anything on the menu that isn't good.  We also had the Chai Latte which was brewed perfectly.  When we arrived the place was packed.  When we put our name in we were told it would be 40 minutes before a table would be available.  I don't think we even had to wait 15 minutes.  The staff was efficient, courteous, and attentive - everything you want when you go out to eat."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews saying not to go on a Sunday morning because it would be mobbed, a friend and I decided to brave it anyway. Thanks to everyone who posted saying parking was a bitch; we parked in the little shopping mall .2 miles from the restaurant and strolled down because it was such a gorgeous morning.   WAIT: The place was, in fact, mobbed. We were told a 25-30 minute wait before we'd be seated if we didn't have a preference as to in or out doors. We didn't, and it was a gorgeous day, so we walked down the street to get a couple lattes before being seated.   SERVICE: Everyone seems to say that the service is slow, grouchy, and elitist, and I can definitely see whereas it may be the case. However, we lucked out by getting a seat at the bar. Funky people to talk to, and the guy servicing it was helpful, attentive, and rather funny to talk to. In the end, I'm glad that we ended up sitting at the bar instead of outside. Also, we received our food within 10-15 minutes of ordering, and he took our drink order right when we sat, then our regular order 5 minutes later. And keep in mind, this is still with a full house and people piling out the door.   FOOD: I'm not quite sure what it is, but their grapefruit juice is outta this world. I need to know what brand they use, because I want to buy it. My friend ended up getting the Booker T., and this was my first experience with sweet potato fries. DAMN were they good. The egg with cheese and sausage in it was also tasty but the sweet potato fries just were amazing taste-wise.  I was feeling something light, and ended up with the breakfast salad. They forgot to put the bacon on the salad which was fine because they brought it out on the side instead, which I preferred. The bacon, by the way, was absolutely outstanding. As a bacon connoisseur, I feel okay admitting that. The greens were the kind of organic mesclun mix that I was used to eating in Maine, and it kind of made me ache of home. The potatoes were good, but I was still envious of my friend's sweet potato home fries. Biscuit with the egg on top to finish was also great. I know people have complained about portion size on here, but we both ended up bringing the rest of ours home and making a second meal out of it, so no complaints over here.  PRICE: Some things were a bit pricy, but as a person who worked in an organic food store, I know what they're probably paying for the produce and protein. The prices being a bit high are understandable if you know how pricy organic stuff can be. I'm not a stuffy organic know-it-all by any means, but having eaten and grown stuff like that and getting used to it, you don't mind throwing down a little extra coin for quality and nostalgia.   Bottom line: Bar = better/faster service Sweet potato fries = absolutely amazing If you like to eat organic and free range, price = not bad at all"}
{"text":"We were lucky to eat at Zada Jane's when it was new, before it became almost impossible to get a seat.  I had the sweet potatoes, eggs, biscuits with jasmine tea. Yum!  Great food and great staff.  We'll go again soon."}
{"text":"Oh, how I love the idea of organic, healthy and delicious food all wrapped up in one cool location...and Zada Jane's does a fine job of it. I've been once for breakfast and just hit it up for dinner the other night. Some tips:   1. Parking on a weekend can be a hot mess, especially at breakfast time. Be sure to NOT park behind the \"No Grease Barber Shop\" or you will be towed (as the sign in parking lot attests).   2. The food is delicious. If you visit in the fall, be sure to order the pumpkin pancakes - they're the best I've ever had (and I'm a bit of a pumpkin aficionado, so that's saying a lot). For dinner I got the Druthers Clucking Chicken Panini with a side salad. The foccacia bread and tomato spread on this panini were delish. Be sure to note that you will get a $2 up-charge on the side salad which you are not warned about on the menu - but to be honest, the home made dressing was so good that I didn't mind.   3. The restaurant has a very cool vibe but is quite small inside, so if the weather doesn't permit outside seating, you could have a wait. Be sure to warn the wait staff if you're in a hurry or they'll leave you on your own for a bit (not a bad thing if you're catching up with friends; would be bad if you're on a quick lunch break).   All in all, two solid dining experiences. And the fact that they support local farmers makes me like it just that little bit more. If you've not been, I suggest you try it."}
{"text":"I went here this morning with one other person and the service was TERRIBLE. When we sat down it took very long for the waiters to recognize that we were there. When they finally came to take our order they hadn't even gave us a menu. I asked for an iced almond milk coffee. When she brought it to me she told me that they were out of almond flavoring and she just substituted it for hazelnut. I would have preferred her to ask for my second choice considering I do not like hazelnut. There was also not creamer or sugar at our table. It was an hour before our food was ready, and people who came after us got their food before us. There are much better cafes/ brunch places in the area. I highly recommend to eat elsewhere and save your money."}
{"text":"I had a real strange morning the other day where half asleep i poured water on myself. in bed. i know. awesome.  So I figured since I was up extra early, I should go get some breakfast and I'd always wanted to try Zada Jane's but the lines on the weekend always dissuaded me.   Well somehow Tuesday morning at 8AM isn't the busiest time for them so I got to sit down right away and have their version of huevos rancheros.   I can tell you it wasn't huevos rancheros per se, but it was pretty tasty so I don't mind them taking liberties to a point. It's a large portion though so I hope you like beans and a real runny poached egg cause you're gonna get a lot of them."}
{"text":"I am not going to say its the best or the worst...I've had breakfast and lunch and personally enjoy their nachos or their breakfast sandwich with grateful growers sausage and cheese on a biscuit.  Service can be spotty and if going on weekends make sure you get there early. This is more of a relaxed brunch requiring you to stick around for a bit which is just fine by me!"}
{"text":"DRUTHER's CLUCKER is amazing in a wrap! 5 stars to this entire place. I will say it is a tad bit expensive. Can't get anything less than $10-$15. But, WORTH IT."}
{"text":"Update: we have this spot another shot. The food was average at best but the waiter was very friendly. It's a cool spot if you want to meeting up with friends for a simply and inexpensive coffee/brunch kinda vibe but the actual food was a let down"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to try this place out and we woke up fairly early this past Sunday and decided to give this place a try. We arrived around 9:30 am and got sat right away. It was a bit chilly out and since I already was cold, we asked to sit inside. There was a larger table open but they still gave it to just us. Our server was friendly and on top of things, asking if our meal was okay after it arrived, refilled our coffees without hesitation; however, not being there ever before I was not familiar with how to order. He asked \"what carb I would like,\" and I was caught off guard and he repeated the question and then asked, \"what carbohydrate would you like?\" I know what carb means but it just caught me off guard since I have never been there before.. The food took a long time to come out and after trying our dishes were were underwhelmed. I ordered 'The Belvedere' under The Merry Yolker Tres Huevo Omelets and my boyfriend ordered 'Booker T's East Side Hasher' under Specialty Plates. I will admit the portions are fairly large and could definitely be shared between two people. My meal was very oily to be an omelet, had way to much garlic bits inside, and the goat cheese was on only a quarter of the omelet - which was the end I couldn't even finish. My boyfriend's meal had way too much cheese on the meal it overpowered the eggs, protein, and sweet potatoes. The biscuits were okay, very hard on the top; so I just ate the inside. I don't believe we will be going back."}
{"text":"Not worth the 2 hour wait to get our food. Especially when the staff is of the attitude it's our privilege to be there. We had a limited time to be in town and the time would have been better spent stopping by McDonald's for a quick bite then getting out to explore the city!"}
{"text":"i pretty much stick to zj's on sundays, usually hungover and they make me right. very spicy and fresh bloody's which i love. UNREAL homemade veggie burgers, great breakfast and usually an awesome vibe kicking, its always a little busy and always has good tunes jamming. for everyone one else they have a wide selection on the menu, some really good beers and a very cool staff. overall a GREAT spot for sunday brunch/lunch or late lunch (my style). i was a vegetarian years ago, im not anymore but love and eat a lot of their veggie fare bc of how good and fresh it all is. try zj's it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great breakfast place, this is it. Sweet potato hashbrowns, free wi-fi, and a nice atmosphere--what's not to love?  Yes, it can get busy, but so can I.  Let's not judge.   Be aware that they serve ice in their orange juice."}
{"text":"I am not from the Charlotte area but was in town for business and the local I was with brought me here for brunch after our meeting.  The service was decent but the Bunny Rancheros was easily the best Rancheros dish that I have ever had.  Hands down.  I am only writing this review so that I can look back next time that I am in town in case I forget the name of the place."}
{"text":"Reading the other reviews makes me wonder if I was in a completely different restaurant.  It sounds about the same, but something was just... off.  Zada Jane's appears to have that hip vibe, there are tables outside, and there are even shuffleboard courts outside if you want to play alongside Central Avenue.  But busy?  Not this Friday night.  It was almost a ghost town.  Maybe some mornings.  Breakfast all day?  Yes, that appears to be the case - but I'd call it a few pared-down offerings, or at best a couple of items that are enough breakfast-like that they can be eaten all day.  Not really a full-blown breakfast menu.  Friendly staff?  They are nice enough, but they really suck at service.  Glasses are empty for a really long time before they get to refilling them.  The menu is absolutely eclectic, I won't argue that.  But I'm not really an eclectic person.  I like to get things that I can't get elsewhere, but I'm not vegetarian or overly organic, either.  In some cases, ZJ's seems to be both.  And pricey to boot.  While the food isn't bad, so-so service and everything else just means that we aren't really big fans of the place.  I'd rather go down the street to the Penguin.  Much more my style, unhealthy food and all."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed with the food here.  It's always been slow service and on weekends there is usually a wait to be seated, but as long as I prepare for that in advance, it's totally worth it.    I enjoy walking here on lazy days with visiting friends or my boyfriend, sometimes in our PJs.  My favorites are the Bunny Rancheros, Soysage Herb Gravy Biscuits, Veggie Nachos, Seared Tuna Sandwich, and the Tilapia with Butternut Squash Risotto."}
{"text":"My first time here and I already love this place!  Great service, great food (breakfast is their specialty, which is served all day long) and nice environment, whether sitting indoors or outdoors.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place has it all- outside games (like stand up shuffleboard, corn hole...), an amazing staff- a really fun environment.  And, if you are vegan and stuck in Charlotte, they can make you a vegan tofu scramble wrap.  It will make you remember how awesome it is to be a vegan and happy that you decided to be one.  I'd recommend you add their hot sauce AND Lorenzo's sauce on the wrap- you won't want it to ever leave your mouth."}
{"text":"Other than checking into the hotel this was the first thing we did when we got to CLT this weekend. My little sis took the hubby and I to \"breakfast\" (for her) lunch for us (I ended up getting a breakfast dish that looked to die for IMO). Hubby got a turkey sandwich of sorts. He said it was good........I got the (Can't remember the name) but it was Guac, sour cream, protein was turkey sausage, hash browns, black beans and two eggs over easy with some tortillas. HUGE portions for the price. I left food (even though I didn't want to) because i was so full and stuffed. Staff was very friendly. Sweet tea was awesome! YUM! Sister got the habernas huervos something or another. It loooked gooooood!ANd they were able to do egg whites for her no problem! Nice place."}
{"text":"We have given this place several chances, mainly due to the lack of other breakfast options in the area. Today was the final straw in a history of bad service.   Zara Jane's has apparently successfully completed a nationwide search to find a staff who cares the least about customer service. Don't expect refills on your drinks and expect to wait over an hour for your food once you order. If you have the gall to stand up and go ask what's going on, no one ever has any clue. The kitchen is SO SLOW and the servers just DGAF.   The food itself is okay, it's a little overpriced but not by that much.   In summary, if you want an okay, overpriced omelette, and you have three hours of time to dedicate, this might be the place for you. Just don't go hungry.   As soon as someone else opens a breakfast place nearby these guys will have to shape up or ship out."}
{"text":"Omgosh!  Cant wait to go back!  First visit was this past Sunday. Everyone was so nice, food was delicious and 1/2 price bottles of champagne."}
{"text":"Congratulations to Zada Jane's..my girlfriend and I have been to quite a few different restaurants between us, but we both agreed that our experience this afternoon at Zada Jane's was the worst yet.  The service was horrible. Our waitress took our drink order, then came back 2 minutes later and took our food order (bunny rancheros and egg & cheese biscuit), then we set there for 30 minutes without so much as a hello. At that point, she came by to say our food would be out in a \"couple of minutes\". Long story short, our food came out exactly 51 minutes after we ordered. I don't know where that type of wait is acceptable, especially when your server checks on you twice during the wait, but it wasn't for us.  The food was okay overall (I would say 3/5 stars), but the presentation looked sloppy, and the portion was awful - three or four total homefries and maybe a handful of beans and chicken. For your own sake, I would definitely avoid Zada Jane's! The food was mediocre, the service was not friendly, and the wait was agonizing!"}
{"text":"ProTip: Do NOT try and come here the morning of Valentine's Day.   We were told the wait was 30 minutes, so 25 minutes later when we came back to check-in, we were told it was another 25 minutes. It was suggested that we could order our food to-go and eat it outside on the deck. We decided to go with this route, even though it took another 15 minutes to place our order and pay for it. The food came pretty fast, and waiting near the cash register counter put us right next to the espresso stand. What are two people to do but order some espresso?   My companion ordered a veggie omelet with a side of potatoes and a biscuit that looked soooo fluffy and steamy and tempting. Unfortunately, I can't do potatoes or biscuits, so I was thrilled to find that Zada Jane's offered loads of other types of breads. I ordered a veggie sandwich on millet rye instead of the recommended foccacia, and had the black-eyed pea salad on the side. While the bread got super soggy from the delicious grilled eggplant and squash, it was tasty all the same! Even the black-eyed pea salad, which I usually don't like but I thought I'd try, was very yummy. All conversation screeched to a halt for 15 minutes while we stuffed our faces out on the patio. We managed to garner a lot of envious looks from a few dozen people waiting for their tables.   Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Oh Zada Janes...such an adorable breakfast joint in the heart of Plaza Midwood. While I always want to love Zada Janes, I just like it. Maybe it's what I order?  Anywho, I love the feel of Zada Janes. Yeah, the parking can be a bit irritating, especially on the weekends, but the location is perfect for sauntering around the area. Inside ZJ is bright, cheery and quirky - a great fit for the location. The menu is inspired and offers up a ton of egg-y options for breakfast, but I'm personally more of a carbo-loaded sweet fan for my morning meal. I know, healthy.  But I stayed away from their pancakes and french toast to try out the Zada Janer - a simple, straight forward breakfast with eggs your style (my choice: scrambled), a protein (my choice: turkey bacon), a carb (my choice: fruit cup), and toast. The meal was just fine but nothing to write home about. My eggs were a little dry - maybe I'll ask for some cheesy scramblies next time? The fruit cup was generous and fresh and the turkey bacon was just so-so. For $8 this was plenty of food for me, but I can see how it could be perceived as a bit steep for bigger appetites.   I want to love Zada Janes as the service is laid back and friendly and it's so cute and homey inside, but for now I just like it. I am, however, a big fan that they support local ingredients and neighborhood events. Next time I'm going to rely on the knowledgeable servers and go for the good stuff."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Fresh food big portions. The place is small and casual and it can be hard to get parking but worth the wait"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. The pancakes are quite amazing. But service is really shaky at best. Have been in more than once when it seems like the wait staff forgets about you and/or food takes forever to come out. Its often worth the wait but you can get frustrated easily, even if there aren't a lot of people around. Sadly we don't go here often anymore."}
{"text":"I found myself at Zada Jane's last weekend after failing to find gluten-free options for my sister at another breakfast locale. So, Zada Jane's does have gluten-friendly going for them (our waitress really was very knowledgeable about gluten).  Overall though, I was not impressed with the cafe. We waited for a table (that's fine, brunch is popular), but I honestly don't understand why so many people were there. The food is mediocre, albeit priced affordably. And the service was very, very slow without any explanation or warning that there would be a wait. My understanding is that this is normally a popular breakfast/brunch spot, so I would think they would be used to the volume. However, all three individuals in my party ordered a basic breakfast plate and we waited an hour for our food to come out.  After waiting an hour, I was unimpressed to find that my sweet potatoes were under-cooked. They had great potential as a dish, but it turns out not-so-great when they're a little crunchy. Thankfully I like my biscuits under-cooked, so my doughy, fluffy biscuit was a two thumbs up. The eggs were fine, but the soysage was actually worse than the frozen kind I buy at the grocery store.  Honestly, the price is so great compared to the mass of snooty brunch places in town that I may come back when I need that basic breakfast fix. But if you're looking for a decent culinary experience, I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Two Words:  Bunnies Rancheros  It's all I get here, period.  Amazing food, fresh and good service.  I don't live in Charlotte anymore but when I visit, it's a must go to for food."}
{"text":"Loved the back patio. We went for brunch and had a good experience. If you like sweet potatoes, the hash browns are for you! I had a sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich, which was cooked to order and delicious. It's not a great place to go for a quick bite, and service was a little slow, but the food and atmosphere did make it worth the wait!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. I will preface this by saying we've only been for brunch but we are regulars. It's a great neighborhood restaurant with some of the best brunch around.   The restaurant itself is quite small but they have a great patio when the weathers nice. Most weekends you will find a 30-45 minute wait for brunch.   Food-wise, best biscuits in town! Add some of their apple butter and you'll leave happy. They also do great omelets and a wonderful cinnamon vanilla pancake."}
{"text":"I ordered a grilled cheese with goat cheese, cheddar cheese, basil and sautéed onions with a side of sweet potato hash . Outside of waiting for a long time the food was good but cold. How does a grilled cheese come out cold. They definitely need more servers and brig the food to the tables quicker so they your food comes out warm."}
{"text":"So I've come here around 3 or 4 times and had roughly the same experience. The food was great, nothing I has struck me as something I can't live without but it's still really good. Drinks have always been wonderful as well-never ordered anything I didn't care for. The staff has always been kind. However, man, I feel for them. This place is always busy and seems under staffed. My birthday, the kitchen was on wait and had to wait an hour and a half for my food and had to get it to go which was a bummer. Last time I waited 15 mins get a drink order without even a \"yo be right with you\" and an hour since being seated for food. In no way do I feel this is the server's fault but probably a under staffing/space issue. I really hope they find a way to fix it so I can continue to come in when I have time I should probably mention I'm also not coming in on weekends or anything crazy so I kind of get a feeling it's a perpetual thing. I'm happy they're busy and successful. I love their courtyard area and that they allow dogs on it-I just wished it was a place that I could get in/out of in an hour."}
{"text":"The To go food must be completely different from the food served in store because all I received where some disgusting eggs the wrong bacon and flavorless potatoes. The biscuit was the only edible part of my breakfast. I'm willing to try this place again but in person. Horrible first impression will definitely not be getting take out from here."}
{"text":"if you go on a weekend, make sure you allow several hours before your next appointment/meet up/gathering/whatever. we went on a sunday and were told the wait was about 30 mins, which wasn't a big deal, until they gave our 4-person table away to a couple because \"it was going to be bad\" since somebody else had taken said couple's table at some other previous point in time (yes, we were told some variation of those quotes lol). i mean, whatever, i get it wasn't the couple's fault, but it wasn't ours either. waiting over an hour to sit down for a basic meal wasn't exactly what i bargained for before my 6 hour drive. it'd be a different story if we were told up front about a long wait, then maybe we would have chosen something else! not to mention our service was terrible, i think we saw our waitress two times before we left (and she did not deliver our food). all in all, i'd been here once before and remembered something way better so either i blocked the truth out or this specific visit wasn't up to par, but i didn't much enjoy it and am super sad about it since it was the location we choose for a small group of friends who hadn't seen each other in a while. eh.....live and learn!!"}
{"text":"You know...I WANT to love Zada Janes. I really do - the atmosphere is so chill, the outdoor patio is great, the wait staff is friendly and for some reason it's always jam packed, which always makes me think I'm missing out on serious deliciousness inside.   But such is not the case. Full disclosure, we came 30 minutes before official close on Memorial Day, so maybe we got the \"230 treatment\", but still. It took 40 MINUTES for us to get our food. HANGER. I got the Booker T hash. The cheese was quite literally a congealed orange blob over the eggs which were so overcooked the damn thing was brown.  My husband got some Grande breakfast, and you could tell they cooked the eggs and sausage first, then probably burnt the pancake and had to re-do the pancake while the other food sat there. Because the eggs and sausage were cold mush by the time they came out...and Redo Pancake was STILL burnt!   So we're grading off breakfast only, and they do offer Lunch and Dinner options. But IMHO, if you claim to specialize in breakfast and ya can't get eggs or pancakes right, I sure wouldn't risk my money on the rest of the menu.   We'll continue to leave ZJ out of our CLT breakfast rotation. Maybe next year!"}
{"text":"Service = D- Food = B+ Ambience = B Prices = D+  Don't go here if you are in a hurry, or looking for value. The food is good, but the prices are too high for what you get, and the service is most decidedly NOT worth the wait.  No amount of free range this, organic that, or veggie whazzat can make up for a lack of smiles, apparent disorganization and just plain coldness. SMILE and you disarm me. If there is going to be a wait for a table, don't just offer me a seat at the bar, offer to SERVE me there, too. When I'm waiting on my food, and eating, freshen my drink more often and I'll be happy. If the kitchen is backed up, let me know that. But for gog's sake, don't look like you *know* it's falling apart around you. I'll wonder if the food is safe!  Pity... This place has a lot of potential. They need to figure out that when they are full, the game is turning tables efficiently. Believe me, many people in the place wanted to get in and out faster than the help wanted them to. We heard some of them talking about it. (\"Where's our food? I need another drink. Damn, they're slow!)  Service can be attentive without being smothering. I guess what I'm saying is, make me feel appreciated, welcome, pampered, and *served* and I won't feel so taken by the high price. Don't make me wait for the check. Come by and offer me a chance to add to it."}
{"text":"I go to this place ALL the time (I've been there twice this week alone) and it seems like each time service gets worse and worse. Its sad really considering that the food is so delicious. I went in today and ordered the french toast with non-crispy bacon(i order my bacon like this every time i go in and its never a problem). My food came out with extra crispy bacon. I informed the server and she thought I wanted it crispy (not a problem since we all make mistakes). It became a problem when she came back out 30 seconds later with another plate of crispy bacon informing me that the batch of bacon was  just a crispy batch and that all the bacon there was cooked like that. I thought this was ridiculous that she would bring out more crispy bacon since I clearly was not happy with crispy bacon in the first place. I informed her that i come in all the time and ask for my bacon the same way and it has never been a problem before. I then asked her if they could just cook me some bacon that was not crispy. She said she could ask the cook and that it would take a few minutes. I was ok with waiting as I was not in a rush and knew that it ALWAYS takes FOREVER to get food there. About 2 minutes later a man brings out a plate of RAW bacon thats slightly warm. I was really annoyed by this but instead of sending it back a THIRD i just chalked it up as a lost and realized that these people could care less whether I left there as a satisfied customer or not. It really upsets me because I  am a server and i would think that people who work in the service industry would always do there best to make sure people leave happy. I guess I'll just have to learn how to make that delicious french toast myself as I will not be spending anymore of my hard earned money in this establishment.  **Not every experience I've had here has been bad. There's a curly-haired bartender there that is ALWAYS great**"}
{"text":"Zada Jane's is the typical funky, eco-friendly restaurant that every big city needs. As usual, it is located in the hipster district and caters to many environmentally conscious eaters on an artist's buck. I tried a few of their breakfast offerings to see what they really had to offer.  The service and atmosphere is nice and friendly, but the grub needs some work. I like that they source locally, but I did not like the texture of my morning items.  My French toast resembled bread with a rubbery coating. It was not super crisp, but it was not super moist. It was just like eating a piece of thick bread that had some egg batter on it.  The sweet potato browns were gross, but not in a terrible way. They were just not very appetizing for $3.25. Sure, you get a large plate, but they were soggy... straight up moist and soft. It was nothing more than overbaked cubes of (probably chopped up yesterday) orange tuber. Some pieces were burnt, others were just floppy.  The biscuit was somewhat dry and dense, but the Grateful Growers sausage made it all the better. The locally sourced pork product was juicy and extremely spicy, just how I like my ground swine. The Imladris Farm apple butter and blackberry jam also improve the rather boring biscuit.  ZJ's is an institution to visit if you are into the cool little California style eatery, but I would go for something other than the typical breakfast fare. Perhaps they make a mean omelet; that is what everyone seems to be raving about."}
{"text":"What an adorable neighborhood spot. My mom ensures we come here every time she comes to town because she loves it so much. Always a wait on the weekend mornings, so help yourself to the free coffee. Make essentially any meal vegan with tofu or soysage.   True neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"I don't know what kind of coffee they serve there, but it is the best coffee I've ever had in my life.  So. Good.  And I also love that they serve it in rando mugs that they just have.  Very kitschy.  It's also got a very hipster-y vibe, so if you're not cool with that, don't go there.  The Huevos Rancheros are the best I've ever had, although I don't eat that every day for breakfast like I do the coffee, so I may be out of line.  Saturday morning brunch is CROWDED, so expect to wait for a table, especially if you have a group larger than 2 or 3.  But, IMO, SO worth the wait, if only for the coffee."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get breakfast in Charlotte. Super healthy options!!!! Biscuits are to die for. Love coming here when I'm visiting my boyfriend who lives around the corner. The staff is lovely!"}
{"text":"I often go to Zada Janes for breakfast on Saturday.  It's a fun scene on the weekends.  I don't know whether they've gotten lazy or changed chefs, but the food here has really gone downhill.  Last week, they brought me an omelet sitting in a puddle of liquid.  Today really got me.  I was excited to learn that the special was blueberry pancakes and ordered them without even bothering with the menu.  What they turned out to be were pancakes with blueberry PIECES.  There were no whole berries.  It looked like in order to stretch ingredients for the special, the chef chopped blueberries and threw them into the batter.  What the heck?  There was no blueberry taste.  I've never seen  anything like it.  Do they think we're idiots?  Why have the special?   Maybe they're so busy, they and their customers have long stopped paying attention to food quality."}
{"text":"Pretty great place, I love the sweet potato and black bean quesodilla and the apple butter is a great addition to it. I always get the Ashley Farms Free Range Chicken it's always tasty and a hefty portion of chicken in my opinion."}
{"text":"We waited about 30 for a table. On a Sunday, I thought that was not bad. My problem was once we were sat it was one hour before we received our food. The crowd had cleared out somewhat so I am not sure why the wait was do long. One couple was sat just after us and I noticed them leaving just as we got our food.  My salad was fine. Generous amounts of chicken with a good bleu cheese. The pancake was yummy. I would go again because I don't like to judge a restaurant from on visit."}
{"text":"Very unique and authentic breakfast. This is not a \"IHOP\" type. Everything is made and presented delicately. Will definitely go back to check out the salads."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, good service. We sat outside on the patio and were served right away."}
{"text":"Love a restaurant with good breakfast all day long.  Good service, good prices and even the dessert was excellent.  Check this place out particularly if you want breakfast food (to be honest I haven't tried anything else)."}
{"text":"I like it - a lot!!  But..... Short one star because you'd better plan on waiting (a long time) on the weekends - this place always has a line. That's usually a good sign and it is true here since the food is really tasty. However, the coffee quality suffered and the service was a bit spotty the last time we went. Back to the food - omelettes are tasty and french toast for kids is a hit. Love the character of the various types of staff here (tattoos, piercings, etc.) just means they're a good eclectic bunch - they're busting their tails in and out of the kitchen and they definitely work hard for their pay!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here before and had a decent experience but this morning was far from that.  We got there early and were the 2nd table sat.  I think the lichen staff rushed some things since it was already busy.  My biscuit came out without the protein I ordered and with cold not melted cheese on the egg.  The side of grits were cold and my wife's omelette was not fully cooked.  Definitely will not be going back.  Only positive was our server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place for breakfast.  Menu is fresh, healthy and different. Love the Bunny Rancheros, but my hubby usually gets whatever pancakes are on special. My favorite part is that they have an espresso bar AND a full bar, so I often get a chai with Frangelica. Fabulous.   The food never disappoints. Ever. Breakfast, lunch or dinner. No matter what you get. Even the breakfast salad with tofu is scrumptious.   Sometimes the wait is frustrating, but I think the place has so much character that it makes the wait bearable."}
{"text":"Zada Jane's is one of the few places in Charlotte with espresso AND and a unique breakfast menu.  It's also the place we bring visitors for breakfast when they are in town.  On weekends, there is usually a wait for a table, but we always wait - it's that good.  The bunny rancheros dish is fantastic, and their biscuits are big and fluffy (and much better than Flying Biscuit).  I like the fact that you can take any of their omelets and wrap them into a yummy burrito instead.  Also don't forget to check the board for specials -- sometimes they have berry pancakes which are absolutely delicious.  Service is usually quick and always friendly.  We like to sit around the bar and chat with Jodie. She remembers our favorite dishes and drinks, and is super nice.  If you like specialty coffees, try the frappabeano in the summer - it's an iced coffee drink that tastes like a milkshake!  The brown sugar cinnamon cappuccino is also pretty good.    One word of warning - Zada's parking lot is small, so arrive early (or extra late) if you don't want to have to hunt for a spot on the street."}
{"text":"Spinach salad with tuna and peppery dressing YUM!  My order was messed up but they made it right!  Great menu refreshing change from heavy southern food. Lots of light options all very fresh."}
{"text":"Only been here for breakfast. Great neighborhood spot. Good food. Always fast and fresh. Staff is awesome."}
{"text":"I've lived in Charlotte for almost a year now and finally went to Zada Jane's.  I had dropped my car off at Meineke around the corner and decided to get breakfast while I waited, so I walked over.  I like that they have a patio and the ambiance is totally casual.  The staff was all very friendly and our waiter was timely and courteous.  The things that stood out most to me were their apple butter and biscuit and the sweet potato browns which I expected to be shredded potatoes similar to hashbrowns, but they were really just large chunks of sweet potatoes cut up and cooked (still good though).  Other than that, nothing really jumped out at me during our visit, I'd say I'll be back, but now that I live in Concord, I probably won't go out of my way for food that's just \"okay\"."}
{"text":"This place was PERFECT to go to yesterday yesterday for brunch. Great space outside and the wait was totally reasonable. Staff was more than accommodating with the hostess coming out to me to put my name in (since I had my dog with me) and then another guy got a bucket of water for the pup too. They were very attentive while we ordered drinks / food / were eating but my omelette was very sub-par. Considering that's all I ordered it was kind of unfortunate. I created my own with sausage tomato onion and cheese but there was barely any cheese to even notice any. My friends dish looked a lot better!"}
{"text":"What a delicious breakfast in such a cute inviting spot. Heading back to Atlanta from Charlotte and found them on Yelp. I love all of the omlette fixings to choose from. I will return next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times to give it more than one try.  I have always come to brunch only.  Every time I have orders my eggs over easy (because that's how I eat them) they come out over done.  Every...single...time, no matter what.  The restaurant is small but clean and neatly decorated.  The bar is an open area and fun to sit at.  There has never been a time that I've come with no wait, the place is rather small inside.    The service is ok.  I wish my eggs would come out right.  Just once.  They didn't do much to accommodate a remake or compensation. Maybe they are just afraid of over easy?? I've ran into similar scenarios elsewhere, just not so often."}
{"text":"Everytime I try to give this place a chance and everytime the staff disappoints me. The good food is not worth the poor service."}
{"text":"We went for the amaretto French toast. There was no taste of amaretto. The bread was toasty and hard rather then soft and creamy. We ordered the bacon soft and it was crisp. Service was fine."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday and endured the long wait. Unfortunately I only found that the food was bland and greasy. The waitstaff was a bit obnoxious. The biscuits and bloody marys were pretty good, though, hence the second star. I would strongly recommend avoiding anything other than the biscuits - you would just be asking for an overpriced stomachache."}
{"text":"To be honest, I haven't been to Zada's in a few weeks, as the mood for their awesome breakfasts always strikes me when the line outside is 30 people deep. At that point, I run for Landmark, and curse the concept of brunch.  But anyway. So the prices are a little high and the portions are a little small, but remember that most of the produce is sourced locally (think the same goes for the eggs and dairy, don't hold me to that though), which is a departure from your normal-arty-eggs-and-bacon breakfast joint, at least in CLT. Coffee is tops and DARK (yay!!) and yes, its extremely vegetarian friendly. There's even an amazing vegan breakfast option that I end up getting half the time, since it's so tasty. If you've ever tried to make tofu scramble really \"work\" as an egg substitute, you understand how challenging that can be!  Lunch works, but even if it's 3pm, I'm ordering breakfast. Unless I'm ordering the veggie nachos. Good lord, those are tasty. We've also tried their dinner menu, and found it very expensive, if artful. The service at night (different manager) was pretty terrible, so we'll stick to ZJ's before 4."}
{"text":"So, I am back in Chicago after spending some time in Charlotte. I've known Chef Don for a number of years and I've had the pleasure of dinning at his restuarants. I have to say that the man is a GENIUS. He touches restaurants and they turn to gold. I love a good dinner spot. Breakfast and lunch is good, but I love a good dinner spot. The last time I was here was for dinner, and let me tell you that the the shrimp and grits with fresh okra is a secret North Carolina touch that did just that....it touched my soul. I may be living in Chicago, but I'm a southern boy  and love me some shrimp and grits. Thank you Chef for sharing the love.  M"}
{"text":"Great food & service for both my wife and I! I recommend the bunny rancheros with the local pork and the mushroom ravioli! Both were great.  This was out first time and we'll be back.  We got the pita/hummus appetizer  and they brought us more pita bread because we ate it all without finishing the hummus!"}
{"text":"The charm of Zada Janes is its cool vibe. The bar is not first come, first serve on Sundays. It's seated like any other table. That being said, the wait was no more than 15 minutes. The food isn't really special. My service was sub par, as I made special request and after looking annoyed, the bartender (an older lady) told me that if it weren't Sunday, they would be able to do it, but it was just too busy. However what I was asking for just would've required the chef to substitute tofu for potatoes.... I just got potatoes on the side and mixed everything together on my own. Whatever. It was comical how she was Not trying to hear it. She didn't have an attitude, just wasn't up for going out of her way. It also took a LONG time for our food to come out. Another person at the bar was visibly irritated. I had a mimosa, which was champagne with a splash of orange juice. We watched her make it, literally a splash. Just enough to turn the drink orange. No complaints from me. At $5, GREAT!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time, Zada Jane's was a highly sought after brunch spot with long waits and iconic breakfast plates. Unfortunately, Zada Jane's is now nothing more than a has-been diner with exceptionally poor customer service and a kitchen staff that must be deaf, blind and dumb.   After a handful disappointing visits, I figured I'd give Zada Jane's a final chance and called in an order on Memorial Day weekend- I mean, how badly could you mess up a takeout order?   When I arrived at the restaurant, I could see my take out boxes sitting on the bar counter with a bill that matched my estimated total all ready to go. After standing by the unattended bar awkwardly for close to ten minutes, I flagged down a waitress that happened to look up from a personal conversation in which she and several other employee's attention seemed to be totally consumed. I let her know that I was here to pick up the order that was sitting in front of me at the bar. She very rudely challenged my assumption that the boxes that matched my order and cost were, in fact, for me, and told me to wait while she grabbed someone that could help me. Perhaps I'm in the wrong here, but I don't find it normal or appropriate to be the subject of such hostility when I was certainly not the one that left my manners at home.  So, I waited. And waited.  Followed by more waiting.  Finally, someone competent appeared and completed this drawn out transaction. Finally, I did not have to beg the staff to acknowledge my presence. Finally, I did not have to argue with the staff to allow me to pay for my food. Finally, I could leave and be on my way.   When I arrived home, I opened the boxes to find that my order was wrong. I paid an extra $2.00 to include an additional meat option in my Booker T. Only one type of meat was to be found. In the other Booker T, the dish was made with an entirely different meat than I had requested. Breakfast cuisine isn't hard. In fact, I'm not so sure as to why I opted to pay $20.00 for something that would cost $7.00 to make at home.   In all, if the next time I find myself craving an unhealthy egg dish served by a grumpy woman with messy hair and no bra, I will stay at home and ask my girlfriend to cook. At least the food will taste better."}
{"text":"I will start out by saying Breakfast is good and the atmosphere is good. That's about it. We have tried 3x for dinner.  The first time was awful, decided to give it another chance and the second time was ok. Last night we went back and again it was awful service and awful food. Neither one of us even finished our meal.  2 out of three trips to this place for dinner ended up in disappointment- we won't be going back unless it's for breakfast."}
{"text":"Food here used to be so great but my basic breakfast I got yesterday (takeout) was horrible. Service was even a worse situation. No one seemed to notice me while I waited at the bar trying to pay for my food."}
{"text":"One word...AWESOME!  The breakfast is amazing and the coffee is perfect.  Must try for anyone visiting Charlotte, NC.  I have tried their Omelets as well as their breakfast sandwiches.  The sweet potato hash side is my favorite. Get there early and check out their specials online."}
{"text":"I love brunch. I know, a lot of people love brunch, its food and at the time of the day where you can have the perfect combination of breakfast/lunch/whatever you want and call it a meal, but I really really LOVE brunch. That being said, I am fairly certain that my bunny rancheros at Zada Jane's today was the best brunch meal I have had in a long time. As previous Yelpers have stated, the inside is quirky with an eccentric feel to it. I was pleasantly surprised today when we walked in and were able to get seated right away by a kind employee who hustled to clean off a table for us. Our server was really laid back, knew her stuff and half the restaurant were some of her regular customers, you could tell. My brunch date ordered something that comprised of eggs, ham, pancakes, toast, and home fries, and it is her go-to every time at ZJ, she lalovves the pancakes. As for my bunny rancheros, well it is pretty much heaven on a plate if you ask me. Black beans, chicken (my protein of choice), herbed potatoes, two eggs over easy, topped with queso, sour cream and two flour tortillas. I may need to go back tomorrow as I am writing this. You cannot go wrong with this selection. The only mistake I made was ordering green tea instead of a mimosa :) As much as I would love to expand my brunching horizons here, I don't see that happening for a long time. Bunny Rancheros for life."}
{"text":"I can't even be calm about how good the meal is that I'm having right now. I wanted to make this review before I left and forgot. I am stopping mid-meal to do this because I want them to get the credit they deserve.  Let's start with the ambiance:  this place is so laid back and welcoming. The patio welcomes dogs, kids, and a game of corn hole or shuffle board. The inside of the place is so colorful. Even with the 20 minute wait, my eyes had plenty to soak up. Even though there are a lot of colors, it's not overbearing. It's light and bright.  The staff is lovely and our server really understands her menu and how to describe their dishes. We chose our meal off her recommendations.  I'm going to be honest, the place could be awful looking and the staff could be crap, but I would come back for the food in a heartbeat. Today's special is a crab cake with tomato and aioli on a biscuit with a side of habanero grits. AMAZING. My guy got the Bunny Rancheros with chipotle chicken. I usually can't stand Tex-mex brunch items, but this changed my mind. The guacamole from scratch, the chicken, even the sour cream (I really can't stand the stuff) was perfectly balanced. I say they should have the guac as a side dish with some chips, so good.  This was the perfect start to our visit to Charlotte. We weren't even planning on going anywhere we couldn't take a short walk to because we're staying the heart of the city, but it was completely worth the short drive. If you live her or are just visiting, don't miss this place."}

{"text":"The brunch here is fantastic. While the wait times (for table and food) are a bit extended, the friendliness and fun of the waitstaff make up for it! If you're in Plaza Midwood for breakfast/brunch, give Zara Jane's a chance!"}

{"text":"We were in town visiting for a week and this was the worst breakfast we've ever had.    Service - Yelp let us down; don't trust the large amount of reviews for this place.  We were ignored when we walked in - one lady was taking a phone order, another lady looked at us but then walked away to enter an order into the computer, lastly the guy was too busy telling a story with other customers to stop and greet us.  We were unsure what the process was, there wasn't a sign saying \"Wait to be seated\" or a host station so we decided to just grab a seat and wait.  Keep in mind that there was 3 people working and 3 tables of customers in the building - 1 to 1 should be easy to manage.  The employees seemed to be having a better time joking with each other and telling stories than to help us.   Food - We ended up getting simple omelettes. When they arrived the eggs were overcooked and the meat inside was extremely overcooked.  The crumbled sausage was burnt so bad that it was black.  The plate was coated in grease from cooking.  By far it was the most disgusting meal we've ever received in.  The food was dropped off at our table by the person cooking it which shows that there is no quality check process is place.  Food was uneatable and service was unwelcoming.  1 star is being generous.  Don't waste your money on a business that doesn't appreciate the customer."}
{"text":"Before I hit the road on Sunday to return to the DMV, my friend and I stopped in Zada Jane's for breakfast. There was a 20 min wait, so we walked to a local coffee shop to burn some time. We were seated (inside) soon after we returned. The restaurant is quaint, but bright, and its motley decor adds to its Southern charm.   Soft spoken Steven was our server. He did a good job covering the featured items and answering questions.  We ordered a few things to assess the menu. My entree was the crab omelette with herb potatoes. We also ordered jalapeño grits. The potatoes were well seasoned and those grits were really good with so much flavor packed into that little cup. However, the omelette didn't live up to my expectations. The egg base was really thick and over cooked. Also, the Boursin cheese that adds the creaminess was not evenly distributed. That omelette could have been a lot better with a little attention.   My gf had this local favorite bookmarked for quite sometime so I was glad to try it out. Not sure when I'll return but it was a pleasant experience nonetheless."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here and it's still as good as the first time. The inside is a little cramped but the outside patio is fantastic.   I recommend the omelettes. Some of the best I've ever had. As well as their herb gravy, order a side of it with your TLC biscuit."}
{"text":"I am not a breakfast person. Brunch, however, is a different story. Give me a yummy pancake and a mimosa at 12 pm and I'm a happy girl. I almost missed out on the deliciousness of Zada Janes brunch because when I first moved to Charlotte, I came here for dinner. I can't remember what I got or what it cost, but I remember that I hated it! So when  I went for brunch for the first time, I was hesitant. I am happy to report that I was wrong in my hesitancy!  I have only ever gotten the bunny rancheros with half chorizo and half chicken or the pancakes. I love, love, love it! My boyfriend loves the vegless avenger omelette and has never ordered anything else. On Sunday (and Tuesday, I think), wine is half off so we always get a bottle of champagne and orange juice to make mimosas.   There can be a long wait but it's always worth it. Servers are always nice. As far as brunch goes, I have zero complaints and a million compliments!"}
{"text":"So disappointed in my first visit to Zada Janes. Upon arrival I went in to ask do I seat myself and the waitress told me yes. I found a nice little outdoor table and read my book while awaiting the waitress. After 30 minutes passed and no one had even given me a menu or asked was I thirsty I decided to go in. The waitress got an attitude with me and seemed very irritated when I asked was there a waitress available to take my order. She sends me back outside and another waitress comes and takes my order I then had to wait another 30-45 minutes to get my food which was only a small grilled shrimp Caesar salad. Which looked pretty good by the way which I never got to taste because as soon as I went in for a bite guess what I find?!?!! Nasty hair in my food!!! Can you say disgusted! Then went I went and showed the waitress she had the audacity to get mad at me like it was my fault!!! I have blonde hair the hair in my  salad was long and brunette!! How about wearing a hair net next time?!?! I'll never go back"}
{"text":"i liked that they have the option to make your own omelet. the chipotle chicken was semi-dry; but lots of filling options  also got a biscuit which hit the spot  got to sit outside which was great w/ the nice weather and only had to wait maybe 30 minutes on a sunday for brunch  overall a nice place for a casual brunch"}
{"text":"After my terrible experience at Showmars, we settled on this place for breakfast/brunch.  It's always packed and after hearing my friends rave about this place, I was excited to check it out!  They were just opening but we were seated right away.  The bartender has some life drama going on and proceeded to yell about it to our server who was waiting on us at the moment.  The food was good and I recommend you guys to try it.  I ordered the Bunny Rancheros and really enjoyed it.  Potatoes and black beans were a nice compliment to the meal."}
{"text":"Our server Taylor was amazing. Supersweet super accommodating I will be back I swear just for her. Got a half price bottle of champagne for mimosas which was a great deal. $11 for the bottle and got four glasses out of it. So if you plan to get more then to mimosas go ahead and get the bottle. Comes with the orange juice. The food took a really long to come out about 45 minutes but it was pretty good it was fairly busy but not that busy to wait 45 minutes to be honest with you and Taylor was so amazing I will be back just for her. And the patio or she's gorgeous. It was also nice to see if they let you bring your doggy only problem is that patrons bring dogs that are a little too in the space is not quite big enough for that I should probably accommodate those guests towards the outer seats."}
{"text":"Cool place, Great healthy food, spotty service"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING pancakes, chorizo sausage and eggs.  My friend had a dish that everyone at the table raved about.   The downside these folks are so darn slow. Do not come here starving. Oh and parking is a tool b"}
{"text":"So Zada Jane's is all about the vibe. That is what sets this place apart from most breakfast places.  Be prepared to wait but there is coffee and mugs on the side for coffee lovers.   I believe it is good food but honestly having to wait that long it is not worth five stars for me. I think their kitchen is tiny or something because it just takes awhile. If you are having fun and not worried about time this is the perfect place for you . I would recommend going to Dish for faster and better food around the corner. The only problem is the hours are little different than here. Zada Janes you either love or not so much.   I would recommend it to people who haven't been ,but I am not like I need to go there right now kind of place. I guess it is unfair since I expect to go to a place where people are licking there fingers yelling 'girl I told you so'. Nevertheless , go and try it and let me know what you think about it too. I hope your experience is a great one!"}
{"text":"Been here many times, the food is delicious, the coffee is even better, but it seems like everyone I go I end up waiting a long time for my food. Honestly it's probably because it's made fresh with great ingredients, but I do know I need time if I'm gonna stop there for breakfast. Have a biscuit!"}
{"text":"Food FINALLY came out after almost an HOUR of waiting. It's good. But the long wait really put me off. Get more kitchen staff, newer appliances, something. I've never waiting so long for brunch. I don't even wanna eat anymore."}
{"text":"I've been going to Zada Jane's for years. I love their breakfast, but the quality has gone downhill. I had lunch there today and found two old grapes in my hummus... apparently they have some issues with cleanliness in the kitchen. The service was super slow too. I never thought that I would say this, but I don't think that I'm going back there. My long relationship with Zada Jane's is over!"}
{"text":"Great find on Central. I was told this street has great food. My first stop was a winner. I experienced the veggie burger with sweet potatoes and a gluten free beer. Don't judge me! The burst of curry on my taste buds were rocking. My friend had salmon and Quinoa, which was delicious. I have been back 3 times since and will bring my family here today. I still need to try brunch. That will be next."}
{"text":"On a sunny morning their patio is the perfect spot to catch morning breakfast and watch people pass by. The atmosphere was eclectic and casual; a little too casual for my taste, the food came out very slowly from the kitchen- but fortunately we were on vacation and weren't in a hurry to be anywhere. The pancakes I ordered were nothing I would write home about- but they did fill me up. The sweet potato hash browns were delicious, though!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go here for a while but when I'm usually in the area, Zada Jane's is an afterthought. Until I went yesterday, I didn't even know exactly what they served.  We finally go the opportunity to go yesterday. The first thing I noticed was that the decor felt a little forced. Kinda like it was trying a little too hard to fit in with the neighborhood. Secondly, this seems to be the hipster epicenter of Charlotte. I felt like running out and buying a scarf doing my hair in that flippy thing way the vocalist for that one band does on his pictures. But I digress.   The menu, at first glance, looked impressive but we eventually settled on a bowl of cauliflower and artichoke hearts soup. The soup was great and it came with some old school Wheat Thins Lance Crackers. The soup was amazing, creamy and hearty. But if I were to do a blind taste test, I would have said it was broccoli soup.  The Becky ordered the Green Mindmelt Panini which had roasted portabellas, zucchini, squash, tomatoes, spinach and mozzarella with a side of the sweet potato home fries. Although it was very messy to eat, it was delicious! All the ingredients went well and were nicely roasted.  I, on the other hand, can't say the same for my Turkey sammich. My sammich came with turkey, guacamole and sprouts. It was the most bland thing I've had in a while. The bread was so dry and stale I could't really down the bites I took. I didn't finish it, took it home, tried a bite a little later, and had to dump it in the trash.  Now, it's not that bad, my sammich was off but everything else was really good. My gripe was with our server. She started off great. She was polite and friendly and smiled a lot, etc. It was nice of her to remember to bring us two spoons for our shared bowl of soup. But towards the end, she just sorta disappeared.  The place isn't even that big for someone to disappear for what seemed like 10 minutes at a time. We wanted to get our check, we had to sit and wait for a long time just to see her and flag her down. Finally brought us our check, took me 10 seconds to take my card out and put on the tray but she was gone by then. We did not see her for another ten minutes. We just sat there with our check, ready to leave, but couldn't. At one point I wanted to just get up and find her. Eventually she came back around and she checked us out. Very traumatic event... haha.  I didn't care much for this place. It's not bad, just not my thing I guess."}
{"text":"I've always heard really good things about the food, so I decided to take my fiends that were visiting from Florida. Since my one of them is a vegetarian I thought this would be a perfect place. The food truly was great and everyone loved it, however the service was really disappointing. I'm REALLY easy to please, but I get really turned off when there's a lack of basic customer service. Our waitress Rachel was extremely rude. We were seated outside and when she came - there was no \"Hello\" or \"How are you?\" or even a smile. She asked if we know what we would like to drink after looking at the menu for only a few minutes. We gave her our drink order and after 5 minutes only 3 drinks came out (we were 4 people). After about 10 minutes she came and all she said \"Oh you, don't have your drink. Do you know what you want to eat?\" Then another 10 minutes went by just waiting for my drink without saying \"I'll check on it\" or \"I'm sorry for the wait\". It took 20 minutes to get the bloody mary only ... let alone the food. That was the last time we saw her for the day. She didn't bring our food, she went around other tables checking on them, but didn't even ask one time if we wanted any refills or how our food is or if we need anything in general. She wasn't even around for us to ask for our bill so we had to flag down a different waitress by the name Alexandra who was actually very sweet. We had a really bad experience and I felt bad that my friends who were visiting were getting such poor service from Rachel after I've been telling them how warm and friendly people are in Charlotte. It was my first time coming at Zada Jane's and the food was great, but because of the lack of customer service I don't think I'll be a returning customer."}
{"text":"How awesome to have such a fun breakfast joint in my hood!  Good food that you can feel good eating- organic and local.   I love booker t's hash. The pork sausage was amazing. And do yourself a favor and opt for the biscuit with jam   If you plan on going on the weekend, go early. The place fills up quick."}
{"text":"If I could add another half a star I would, because Zada Janes is a little more than just A-Ok. But I'm not a fan quite yet, and here's why: I'm not going to complain about the wait times, because like every other place that's small and popular, even Zada Janes has ridiculous wait times, especially on a Sunday at brunch time. It's a really cool looking place; colorful and lively. The ambiance is neat, the servers are friendly, the Bloody Mary looked fantastic (and I'm going back there, just to try it because I didn't the last time), the food however, and I'm talking strictly about the vegetarian food, was ehh ok.. We ordered three different dishes  - the east western (scrambled tofu in curry powder), the veg burger, and the No-Da salad. the salad was good, the tofu was alright - kinda bland, and the burger is not something I would eat again. It's definitely a place worth checking out, and I'm going to give it a second chance. This time I'll have the Bloody Mary, and try some of the non-vegetarian dishes, and then I'll come back and update my review.. or not :)"}
{"text":"pretty damn good breakfast. amazing service, food is good crowd is nice as well. and they make a decent espresso. have been 4 times and never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian, but my best friend is. It's a good thing they cater to both. My chicken sandwich was amazing! The cheese had such good flavoring! My best friend got the veggie burger and it looked amazing too, made with lentils (one of my favorites). The staff were super friendly, the vibe was chill, the customers were even intriguing. I'm a super fan of this place!"}
{"text":"Am I going to be the outlier here? I was so shocked when I saw that the overall rating of this place was only 3.5 stars. I began to doubt my choice to add this to the Sunday Brunch exploration list, but we went for it anyway because of a couple friends' recommendations.  There must've been some pretty grumpy people for all the 3 star reviews. I had an amazing experience here. Short wait (We were seated within probably 10 minutes of getting there), and we got a table outside in the patio filled with puppies and hipsters. Man, I adore Plaza.  Our waitress was kind and attentive. The manager came up to us about 10 minutes into our wait and preemptively apologized about the wait for food. It did take a while, however, because we were warned, I won't deduct a star. I get it, it's a popular place, kitchens get busy. I ordered the Booker T's East Side Hasher and it was fantastic. Sweet, salty, and honestly, super unique. I've never had anything like that before.  The lady ordered The East-Western, and loved it as well. We both got a side of their biscuit with herbed gravy (instead of sausage) and that was stellar as well.   The brunch prices weren't bad at all, we came out under $25 together. When you compare that to some other prix fixe places, that's impressively cheap for two. We'll definitely be back, but we have a couple of other places to check out before we start making second-rounds again!"}
{"text":"Waffles were delicious and apple butter is addictive! We lived the eclectic collection of coffee mugs--like getting coffee at a friend's house."}
{"text":"Herb Sausage gravy and biscuits are out of this world.  Was anxious to try them because most places over do the herbs.  The atmosphere on a Thursday morning was very welcoming and enjoyable.  It's likely a zoo on weekends, but once you try you can see why.  Lastly, if you can, ask for Jody.  She was tremendous."}
{"text":"Love everything!!! Steven was an awesome server, great personality, amazing food, cool environment."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times.  Breakfast/brunch is their speciality but I like the dinner too.  I usually get the ravioli.  Sweet potato hash is good too.  Outside patio is great on a nice day!"}
{"text":"I've never left a review of anything. I've been coming to Zada Janes for years, since it's opened. The service has always been bad. The food, I've always loved, which is why I've come back. But after this past week I'm going to have to call it quits.   My husband daughter and I went for breakfast a few months ago and we're the first to sit on the patio, as it filled up everyone got their food before us, still no food, my husband asked for more coffee, the waitress walked in and out of the door completely disregarding his request, still no food, the waitress walked out of the door for the third time with a bowl of water for a dog.... still no food or coffee. At this point we got up and left, hungry of course and went to the drive thru at mcdonalds.   Last week, again first on the patio, with a friend this time who also says she's never had good service here and lives a block away. Again we were last to get our food, we ordered some sandwiches and we're at the restaurant for over an hour and half!!!!    The reason I won't come back, the nachos which I've always loved were sooo stale and the veggie burger which has always been my favorite was god awful with no flavor.   So save your time and money. Go to krazy fish or three amigos or even five guys across the street!!! You've got a lot of choice in this area."}
{"text":"I went to Zada Jane's with the husband for Sunday breakfast.  Before 9:00, people were lined up at the door.  It didn't take too long to be seated, and both hostess and waitress were fresh faced and cheerful.  The decor features bold, brash colors that one may have not thought to put together, but they work.  Brett got a large serving of blueberry pancakes, and an order of hash browns topped with egg and cheese.  So much food that he ended up taking some home, along with some from my plate.  I had The Belvedere, an omelet featuring mushrooms, onions and peppers, along with yummy surprise bites of goat cheese.  The plate also had hash browns, which were really roasted potatoes, perfectly cooked with nicely browned edges.  A biscuit arrived as well, which was a real treat for me since I consume little gluten.  The buttermilk flavor of the biscuit shone through.  I ate the whole biscuit with butter (bad girl)!  Our waitress was on the ready to fill our coffee cups, and the whole experience was completely happy. Our cat, Newman, approves of this review.  He lay on my lap and was in direct line of my hand brushing across his head as I typed.  Purrrrrrr!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very sweet place. Great energy and people. Roger is very hospitable. The sweet tea is amazing as are the jams but the kicker for this vegan was the tofu scramble. It's the best I've had. EVER.  Thanks so much to Zada Janes!!"}
{"text":"Mixed review on a dinner visit. One entree, mushroom ravioli, said to be delicious, but my entree, the meatloaf, quite the opposite. Probably made days ago- dry and unappealing taste and texture. Smashed potatoes were very good. Service was fine.   It was a weekday night and not too busy so the tired and dreary surroundings were noticeable. I noticed tears in the vinyl bench seat. Not an inviting place to eat. Would be better if eating outside for brunch on a weekend when one wouldn't see how it looked or just as a bar hangout when looks didn't matter."}
{"text":"This place is so good. They definitely give you a lot of food for your money. I had the east side hash with a side slice of amaretto french toast. My husband had the vegless avenger. Both were very good and very filling. We couldn't finish all the food. Definitely come on an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"Had dinner for the first time there, I was pleased with breakfast and lunch in the past so I thought we'd give it a try after our big \"Latino Rally\" on Tuesday.  My Latina Sisters and I have a standing date to try new places once a month but this was an extra this month because of the rally. We ordered the Spinach Dip, Calamari and some lovely Shrimp wrapped in Zuchini for appetizers, all good but the Shrimp were cooked to perfection and stood out. As well as our generous cocktails of course. The Crabcake I never tasted because I was busy with my Riccota Gnochi, blistered tomatoes and Skirt Steak, it was all good but the steak was a tad too much for me. I rarely eat Beef unless it melts in your mouth, I do more seafood or chicken. The meat was a tad chewy and I was full, I took it to go and gave it away but it was flavorful. The service was great from Ms Tab, she was friendly and down to earth like most of their servers."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE.  We sat outdoors on a Saturday morning, which I understand is a busy time. If you're that slammed or short-staffed, let me know. I worked in the industry. I get it.  But if you can't offer me water or coffee and I need to ask for it, give me a break.  We waited a full hour for two omelets with no updates on our order.  When it came time for the bill, our server didn't even have the decency to hand the bill to my husband, she tossed it on the table as she walked by.   Food and music was decent so that's why I'm giving them two stars.   To the owners, you need to give your staff some training on how to provide the service of waiting on guests. We will not be back to give this place a second try. Once was enough."}
{"text":"Tried Zana Jane's for the first time this past weekend for brunch on Saturday...WOW, what polarizing reviews this place has!  Fortunately, we didn't have much of an issue finding parking on the street and we only had to wait about 20 minutes for a party of 4.  It was beautiful outside so I truly didn't mind the wait!  The brunch menu was solid and reasonably priced.  I was looking for a protein-packed meal and found what I was looking for in moments...It was a huge frittata-style scramble with my choice of protein (I opted for the applewood bacon), sweet potato hash and it was served with one of their biscuits...it was all absolutely wonderful!  I literally ate every crumb.  Granted, we were coming in for a post-workout meal and I was super hungry so I don't know if my view was distorted a bit but I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.  The sweet potato hash could easily become addicting.  They have already made their way into a couple of my daydreams.    The service was just eh.  The waitress was slow, the food took forever to come out she botched our checks...but all is forgiven thanks to the sweet potato mash.  The atmosphere is fun, hipster and trendy--adorable place.  I guess as others have mentioned...just know before you go...parking sucks, the wait is brutal and the service may be slow..then you won't be shocked upon arrival and can hopefully just enjoy the sweet potato mash uninhibited.   I will no doubt be back..probably this weekend...did I mention the sweet potato mash?"}
{"text":"I've only been here for breakfast, so I realize I may be missing some phenomenal lunch and dinner, but my breakfast was definitely lacking.  The service was great, the ambience is very friendly and I love the mixed coffee mugs, but what was actually on our plates could have used at the very least some salt and pepper, if not a whole flavor boost. I had the east-western, and I could pretty much only taste curry powder in the watery scrambled veggies. I knew it was just liquids from the spinach, but my dining partners were afraid I was eating very undercooked eggs. Unfortunately very bland for something that has so much potential... and it came with one slice of toast, I'm pretty sure any other restaurants' standard is two.  The booker t hasher was a bit better, but again only delivered hints of the expected flavors. The basic breakfast was just that, and eggs were cooked correctly.  With lines out the door every weekend I feel like I must be missing something, but maybe I need to try the lunch menu next time."}
{"text":"Wow! What a fantastic spot.   **Breakfast review only** [& I cannot wait to come back to try Zada Jane's for everything and anything else!]  My friends and I came here on a Friday morning for breakfast. We sat down right away, and the service was fantastic. Coffee brewed in house. Nothing too special, but something to wake up the taste buds in the morning!   The breakfast dish of my likening was Booker T's East Side Hasher. If you don't like cheese, this is not the dish for you. Make sure to opt for the pork sausage, it's a local vendor! This comes with a side of toast or TLC biscuit and you need to get the biscuit. Whatever you opt for, make sure to try to homemade jam, it is absolutely incredible.   This just might be the tex-mex breakfast place I was looking for right here in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Zada Jane's was recommended to me by a Charolotte native that now resides in Seattle. So, when I flew to Charolotte to visit my bestie, I made sure I had breakfast here at some point during my trip.   As I sat outside of Zada Jane's in my rented Kia Soul, I anxiously awaited their doors to open. When I saw two gentlemen walk up to the entrance I shortly followed.   I was greeted and seated by a nice lady to which I immediately asked for a bloody mary because when you're on vacation, you get booze for breakfast of course! The bloody mary was nice and not too spicy. It complimented my Booker T's East Side Hasher very well. The Hasher came with a bed of sweet potato home fries (which were to die for), two \"happy eggs\" fritatta style (according to the menu) and your choice of Grateful Growers pork sausage (where all their pork products come from), turkey sausage or soysage (I chose the Grateful Growers pork sausage), then covered in heavenly melted cheddar cheese and sprinkles of green onions on top. You can then choose their TLC biscuit or toast (Duh, I ordered the TLC biscuit). Just writing this review tempts me to book a flight to NC to see my bestie again.... and Zada Jane, my new BFF.   My bloody mary was a damn good bloody mary. No frou frou bull crap in the garnish, just the essentials. It was a get-to-the-point bloody marry that went so sinfully well with my breakfast that I had \"wished my bestie had called in to work that day and joined me for breakfast\" good. The sausage from GG was just perfectly seasoned and complimented the sweet potatoes very well. The cheddar, well we are in the south y'all, was rich, very very rich and extra melty (grins from ear to ear aaaaaand now drooling). The happy eggs, let me just grab the definition off the menu, free range eggs. You can rest assured folks that your eggs were happy prior to them becoming your breakfast/lunch. No wonder I was pretty damn happy after I ate my breakfast! Also, even though the morning sky had overcast, my breakfast and my rental car, being a super bright yellow Kia Soul, brightened up my day.   Oh Zada Jane, why must you be on the other side of the country! I cannot wait until I make the trek out there just to come back and try your other offerings. As I sit here so early in the morning typing out this review and my stomach is so empty and hungry craving one of your sweet sweet breakfasts..... ok... on to southwest.com pronto!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite place in Charlotte - the atmosphere is great and the food is amazing - never had a bad meal.  Try the Hummus Frummus Wrap - the hummus is amazing!"}
{"text":"Small building not really a waiting area so you stand in the middle of the room which is awkward. GREAT food though! They were ok doing substitutions and didn't charge me extra.  The breakfast was delicious and they pride themselves on having different options for all kinds of foodies. Vegans, Vegetarians, health conscious... They also have a list of specialty drinks you can order and homemade jam on the table. I would go back there when its warmer so I could experience it with a little more room."}
{"text":"yum yum yum.  two fantastic charlotte friends took me here proclaiming - \"you will love this place.\"  they were absolutely right.  this place has the potential to be the hipster diner of your dreams, only the staff are funny and sassy enough to not hate them.  we sat at the counter because the wait was crazy long for a booth.  the male counter server was hilarious and kept bringing me sweet tea after sweet tea.  the waitresses each had aprons made from old timey fabric, and not fabric that's made to look old timey.  you can spot a few hidden gems on the walls - framed johnny cash and a copy of herb alpert & the tijuana brass' whipped cream album are among the wall decorations.   i ordered the bunny rancheros with turkey sausage, which was delightful.  black beans, eggs, and salsa verde that my mouth still dreams of weeks later.  i could not eat this with the wraps that were given with bunny r; it would have been a feat too messy."}
{"text":"Tried this on my last visit to Charlotte and loved the place. There is character appeal, customers playing shuffle board out front and fabulous food. We sat at the bar and had good company with the bartender. I recommend the Sunday mimosa, but remember Sunday drinking times...excellent breakfast."}
{"text":"I went to Zada Jane's last year with a friend for lunch the food and service was good they had a diverse menu. We had a good time this is a keeper."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and went to breakfast with a friend, a few days ago. It looked like a cute little breakfast spot, in a hip part of town, the food when it came out looked good, but as soon as I started eating, was disappointed. I had the two egg special (scrambled) with bacon, herb spuds and a biscuit with a side of gravy. My scrambled eggs were fine, although a lack of flavor makes me think they weren't fresh eggs, my herb spuds were the consistency of cold French fries and only lukewarm, again not flavorful, despite obvious herbs on them. These two things alone would normally make me think it might just be a bad morning for the wait staff and my plate had sat under the heat lamp too long. It was the thin, Jim Beam's-looking bacon that had crunch but nothing else and the bland gravy that made me think Zada Jane was all street appeal. The ingredients didn't taste fresh, the gravy tasted like it was from a mix (if it was from scratch the components must've been lacking to begin with), and the coffee was only, not-unbearable, on top of an unsmiling wait staff. Not sure Charlotte has anything better, so I might be back, but I won't care either way."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Server was so funny and upbeat, had a great time. My wife had a grilled cheese and soup and loved it. I had the Druther's Clucker and it was very good. Little pricey for lunch, but all was good."}
{"text":"There is probably nobody in town that won't tell you how hot of a breakfast place this is. You will probably have a wait of 30-90 minutes but it is some of the best breakfast food in town. We really love the huevos rancheros! BUT watch out for dinner the service and food were not what we are use to at breakfast! So basically breakfast, lunch, yes yes yes!! Dinner not so much,"}
{"text":"Eclectic little spot here in the Plaza Midwood neighborhood. It absolutely has a cool vibe and interesting decor. Very... mingled.  I opted for the huevos rancheros and it was different than others I've had. More like an omelet with grilled chicken, black beans and pepper jack cheese, but topped with pico and sour cream. That's not what I was expecting but it was still very good.  My wife chose the frittata style eggs and didn't enjoy it much. She said that the eggs, with the melted cheddar cheese and the pork sausage, had the texture of shoes. Well, that was a bummer. But the biscuit was good with their table jam on it.  But with that said, we both thoroughly enjoyed the sweet potato hash.  So go with the sweet potato hash and you should be okay!"}
{"text":"We've been Plaza Midwood residents for 13 years and have enjoyed supporting many of our local businesses. After years of spending many weekend breakfasts at Zada Jane's, we've finally had our last.   We arrived as one of the first tables on a Sunday. No wait for either inside of outside. It was still pretty quiet. Our family of four waited 45 minutes for our breakfast after ordering, while tables continued to be served who arrived and ordered after us. Once our food came I quickly discovered that my omelette was filled with goat cheese and asked them to remake it as I had ordered it - no goat cheese. Two different people asked me to remind them what I had ordered. 15-20 minutes later my family had finished eating when my food was brought. We asked to have it packed to go so they simply brought me a box. No real apology. No offers to make it right. No helping me pack up my breakfast.   I wish this was a one off but service has continued to steadily go down over the years and the neighborhood location can't justify such bad service."}
{"text":"Veggie heaven!   I got the veggie nachos (black beans, zucchini, corn, salsa, guacamole-no cheese) on black tortilla chips-yum! Also had the vegan soup and roasted vegetables. The variety in the roasted vegetables was superior! (Note: The black eye pea salad and roasted sweet potatoes are not vegan).  The service leaves a bit to be desired. Seemed as though one person was trying to do it all. Maybe hire an extra server for the place. The knowledge of the one guy doing it all was...okay at best. If asked a question he was always unsure but would happily go and check.   The atmosphere was delightful! Cute decor and fun music. Parking is limited and challenging though.   They have wine, beer, and coffee with many Torino syrups too. Their vegetarian and vegan items are fairly well marked and they even have gluten-free options. I would come again!"}
{"text":"After always passing by because of people waiting outside to get in, we finally decided to wait and have a bit to eat over the weekend.  Overall the staff and service was friendly and warm. The food was good but nothing really stood out. They forgot meat in one of the dishes and kindly brought it out to us, but I'm not sure why this place is so popular. Everything seemed average to me and my husband. We can say we tried it, and I can leave it at that."}
{"text":"Zada's is great.  It has a sweet atmosphere with a lot of unique local art, a great menu and even better food.  The service is never fantastic, but for how busy they are- especially on weekends- I don't mind.  So I would suggest either setting aside a good chunk of time for b-fast or going in knowing exactly what you want."}
{"text":"The sheer number of reviews for Zada Jane's was enough to tempt me to purchase an online deal and venture into Charlotte for some good grub. It proved to be worth the trip as it proved to be a really excellent meal.   The parking was a little tight, and would have been harder to figure out had it been busier. We arrived at 6pm on a Saturday and the place was a ghost town, which suited us just fine. We got a prime people-watching spot on the patio area and it proved to make for an entertaining meal. The service was well-paced the the hipster waitstaff crew were attentive and friendly.  The beer selection is composed mostly of bottles, but they consisted of different microbrews which was a plus. After ordering our brews we got a basket of Kool Kip's Nachos...vegeterian style ($7.25) , for an appetizer. Despite the absence of meat, these were some of the best nachos I've ever had, and that says a lot. The roasted squash, peppers, onions and corn, topped with black beans, guac, and sour cream proved to be quite the hearty starter. The blue chips also made a for a solid mode of transportation for the nacho toppings. I would highly recommend going with a plate of nachos if you are grabbing a meal here.  For dinner I had the Braised Short Ribs ($19.95) and it was out of this world. Now I've been disappointed with dry, grizzly short ribs in the past, but that was not an issue at Zada Janes. These suckers were succulent, tender and delicious, and the portion was mind-boggling. I, Rob B, was only able to eat half the meal and took the other half home for a tastetacular leftover lunch the following day. These mighty short ribs came with these amazing mashed potatoes and cole slaw. Combining a bite of meat, potato and slaw proved to be pure excellence.   The missus ordered the Wild Mushroom Ravioli ($15) which she really enjoyed. I wouldn't touch those 'shrums myself but she gobbled them down. Her portion was also a bit much and had plenty of leftovers for the following day. The only downside was that the mushrooms were just too oily and rich...someone in the kitchen had a heavy hand with the oil. Hers came with a side salad which was really good for a side salad, with high-quality veggies. She went with the lemon thyme dressing and that was really a winner. If you get a salad here, give that dressing a whirl.  With all these good eats we simply had no room for dessert, despite how much we wanted to give it a whirl. Zada Jane's proved to be a really good restaurant and we'll definitely be back in the future, without the online deal."}
{"text":"Went for a walk in Plaza with my sister and her 2 year old when we decided to check this place out. I'd heard good things but wanted to see what was up.   The place wasn't too busy, seemed like a typical Wednesday crowd, however you could see how some people were anxiously awaiting their food.  Our 2 year old was asleep, so we figured we would give it a shot. Sadly the experience wasn't any different for us.   Server told us to seat ourselves and then they forgot about us. Got our own menu from the bar, so took about 15-20 min to put our order in and get waters.   We waited over an hour for a pancake, a cup of fruit, & a salad. We tried to cancel our order after my nephew woke up fussy and we had already been waiting for a good 50 min. As we made this request one server whispered to another and then another server came rushing out of the back with our food.   We heard multiple excuses about how some orders got mixed up and as well as the ticket printer wasn't working; however we weren't told any of this until after we requested for our order to be cancelled.   Future reference to this situation: Communicate this to your customer so they know what to expect and can level with you.   The boxed up food to-go got the stars in this review, the service definitely did not."}
{"text":"Went here the other night with the parental units. Absolutely loved their set up and the dog friendly patio a plus! Our waitress was very sweet and the service prompt.   Mom ordered the flat iron skirt steak sandwich--which is to die for!  The steak was so perfectly season and cooked to perfection. It as incredible.   I ordered the spinach salad and it was perfect. Watching my weight as summer is around the corner.   Unfortunately, my dad ordered the crab cakes... no bueno. They were fishy... not fresh. Too bad.... but we still will go back... just avoid the crab cakes.   Yum, can't wait to try their breakfast.   Cool and hip spot!"}
{"text":"Our server was extremely funny and sweet.   I had the nachos...they were good! The amaretto french toast is amaaaazing!   My boyfriend had the Green Mile sandwich and it was probably one of the best sandwiches we ever had!"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot for brunch! Great vibes, superb service and yummy food. The Bunny Rancheros are a house favorite and they are delicious. I will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and a great place to go on a weekend morning to chill."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Charlotte I want to come here. The food is outstanding, I can't think of a better place to go to sober up from the night before. I also love that every coffee cup is unique."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the rancheros it was great! Also the pancakes !!! Definitely will be back. Great brunch place !"}
{"text":"I have always loved Zada Jane's however I will not be returnung after today's experience. Took forever to get food Order was not as ordered They now serve awful biscuits and if you ask for what  they use to servce tbere is an upcharge Bacon was awful- they took and agrred to replace, but never brought it t back  Upcharge now for the famous orabge butter even if you order pancakes  Shared a table with two different groups and their orders were all wrong. SO  dosappoibted in one of my local hangouts- looking for a new brunch location.  ."}
{"text":"Wednesday night. Nice summer night, sat outside. Had flat iron steak on pita w herb roasted potatoes, really good. Chill spot in an eclectic area. Great groupon choice. Weekends are pacled though."}
{"text":"I came here for Sunday brunch once with a friend and was pleased. I ordered the Booker T's East Side Hasher -- \"a bed of sweet potato hash browns topped with two Happy Eggs frittata style with your choice of local Grateful Growers pork sausage, turkey sausage, or soysage,then covered with melted cheddar cheese and green onions - choice of toast or TLC biscuit.\" Damn good! The only reason I haven't returned is because of the long wait. I drive by with the intention of going in but see the long line and keep on driving to Dim Sum."}
{"text":"It was pretty busy inside so our group of 8 decided to sit outside.  I understand that it can be difficult to manage a large party, but our server seemed to not give a hoot about our table at all.  I had to go ask for silverware and unless we specifically asked to have our drinks refilled it was not done.  One of our group was completely ignored and ended up having to get her food to go. The actual food itself was okay.  I think the breakfast stuff seemed to turn out better than the lunch items with the exception of the fried potatoes which were still kind of hard."}
{"text":"They're lucky they've pretty much have no competition for breakfast or brunch. Food is solid, service is woof. Solid patio."}
{"text":"Food is great but a bit overpriced for what you get.  I have been a few times and have had several different menu items. I do love that they have Greatful Growers pork (all natural). I normally do not eat pork, but this stuff is really good!!! Latte's are yummy!  On the flip side....the parking, well...sucks..and there almost has always been a long wait and no where to sit...  We also have never had a pleasant visit as far as the greeting/seating staff goes. They seem to be disconnected from the patron's and really could care less...  Our server's have been kind though...so far :+)"}
{"text":"The waitress seems all over the place and it isn't busy. She's not very helpful and I've noticed that she's only making sure all of her Caucasian customers are ok. This is my 2nd time here. The food is taking forever but I'm hungry and Patient. I've heard great things about this place so I'm extremely disappointed in the vibe here today"}
{"text":"I have heard raving reviews for this place and was excited to check out what all the hype was about. We had a group of 4 and the wait was about 15 minutes on a Sunday around 1pm. Not a bad wait for brunch at such a popular spot! There was corn hole and shuffleboard out front to help pass the time. All tables on the patio had umbrellas for some shade and relief from the heat. I was excited to see that \"seasonal\" coffee flavors (i.e. gingerbread, pumpkin, peppermint, etc.) are served year round. Always added points in my book!   I must admit I was a little disappointed with my meal. I ordered a basic create your own omelet with turkey bacon, mushrooms, spinach and cheese. When my plate came out, I had an omelet with a TON (never thought you could have too much, but it was pushing it) of turkey bacon and cheese only. I was told that they ran out of spinach and mushrooms, but was not informed until I was served something other than what I ordered. I understand that later in the day you run the risk of running out of ingredients. However, you would expect the courtesy of being notified before they prepare your meal so that you can change your order accordingly. It was rather underwhelming.   Two of the others in our group had been before and highly recommended there. One had ordered a chicken sandwich that she previously had gotten and loved and was a little disappointed this time.. so maybe the restaurant was just having an all around off day. Another in our party got the bunny rancheros which they were very happy with. That seems to be their tried and true menu item. The biscuits and seasoned potatoes (side dish) were very tasty!"}
{"text":"Very cool place!  Great location right off of central... and when it was as nice as it was outside like yesterday, it has a great outdoor eating patio.  Went here after a 4mile race, so naturally we were all starving so the service seemed a little on the slow side (or we were just starving and dehydrated)... it's all good though because it was well worth the wait.  I had the bunny rancheros with turkey sausage....  the food was too pretty to eat!  I got over it pretty quickly and devoured my meal in a matter of minutes.  Looks like they have really good biscuits here too - pair that with the local jam/jelly thats on the tables would be a winning combo.  I watched in envy as my friend ate 2 of those things in 4 quick bites.  Local art is displayed on the walls so it makes for a cool place."}
{"text":"ZJ's has great food. The outdoor seating is awesome. Playing corn-hole as you wait for the table is a plus. When you are waiting, they offer you coffee.  But, if you go on a weekend, you have to expect it to be busy. There are not many solid brunch places in Charlotte. So this one is popular. Plan on waiting 30-40 minutes. And the hostess we have mainly dealt with can be a bit...ditzy? I don't know. She is sweet, but disappears a lot... doesn't really know how to properly judge you wait time (we were once told 10 minutes when there were about 5 parties in front of us on a Saturday morning at 10. Nope). If you go expecting to spend a leisurely time... you are set!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and poor service (except the lady with the dreads - she is fabulous). First time I talked to the server about my celiac and he served me burned sweet potato hash with cheese that apparently had gluten. Second time I got some other mediocre food I can't even remember and the last time I got a mediocre latte from a brown haired woman who seemed annoyed that I couldn't have gluten and was much less friendly after I told her. She also seemed annoyed that we were sitting at the bar drinking coffee and only one of us was getting food (not me because I knew I couldn't trust her to put an order in with her attitude and my first experience at the place). Sorry to inconvenience you? Additionally, the place just seems dirty like they wouldn't do great on a health inspection. It's a bummer because it could be great if the staff wasn't so lame."}
{"text":"First time here. Full bar and tasty looking breakfast/brunch/lunch menu. Very chill vibe and the bartender Jodie was very very sweet.   Check out their hours. They are different on Mondays & Tuesdays as opposed to the rest of the week.  Will come back again to try the \"happy eggs\""}
{"text":"First time trying this place, arrived during a what seemed to be \"dying down after a rush\". However was very disappointed in the service of the staff. Getting seated right away was no problem, but the food literally took right at 30 minutes to receive our food! Coffee was weak not fresh, after ordering another beverage from the bar a \"Bloody Mary\" that took an additional longer than usual amount of time. The food tasted good however fail on the staffs side for not delivering the food and in forming us that one of the toppings for the dish, was out of stock, and if it could be replaced with something else! And yet an hour and something later here I am writing this and waiting on my check..... I give a service rating of 2 stars and a food rating of 3 stars!"}
{"text":"So what's the big deal here and, based on the experiences I've had coupled with a lot of the other Yelp reviews I've read, how are they still open?  Cute decor? Definitely. Funky?  Certainly. Hip? I suppose. All that does not a restaurant destination make though.  The food sounds nice on the menu and the fact they are supporting local farms and growers is appreciated but the results are just so uneven. It tastes good but it's cold, it's hot but overcooked, it's hot and cooked properly but really doesn't taste quite right. It's perfectly prepared and delicious. Who can tell?  Add to that the fact that the front of the place is a disorganized mess and the staff is either surly or outright rude and condescending and I get back to my original sentiment. How is this place still open?"}
