{"text":"A hidden gem in Mississauga. Been here for many years in an easy to overlook spot, more known in the Chinese community with regulars who frequently come back.

A small \"mom and pops\" restaurant with a few tables run by a friendly couple. They try to aim for a more homemade style of cooking (i.e. no MSG, less salt, less oil/not overly greasy). The food is quite tasty still, but some may find it is not as flavorful if they're use to strong flavors as a result.

Affordable pricing. Portions reasonable. Dinner comes with complimentary Chinese soup and rice. The owner can recommend what is good or fresh that day when taking your order if you ask.

Some recommendations:
BBQ meats (duck, pork, chicken, etc.)
Minced Pork with Braised Eggplant
Minced Pork with Green Beans
Sweet and Sour Pork

They also do special dishes off the menu by request if ordered in advance. 

Some previous reviewers stated that the downfall is this restaurant can get quite busy. This is true especially during Chinese festivities/holidays as they do many special orders. But keep in mind as it is a \"mom and pops\" shop hence they cannot accommodate certain requests on some times/days.

Some customers (myself included) like to bring lunch boxes to bring leftovers for the next day. 

If you're craving Chinese BBQ or some relatively guilt-free Chinese food, here is the spot."}

{"text":"Had the lunch special for $6.78 with tax, consisting of bbq duck and rice.  I also asked for ginger and green onion sauce on the side, which was abundantly provided.

The lady at the store was busy inside the kitchen and it took her awhile to notice that I was there, so I took some pictures of the menu. She noticed me when I said hi.  Note, the prices are at the bottom of a list of items, so it's easy to miss.  I don't know how much the meat and veggie dishes are by itself because I couldn't find the price beside it, which is super confusing.  I did not see any paper menu for takeout.

There is enough sitting if you want to have a sit in dinner.  

The bbq duck was average portion and of average taste.  I cannot say that I would crave to go back here. The service was really friendly though."}
