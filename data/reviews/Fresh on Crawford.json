{"text":"I thought I was finished with Fresh, but a friend from out of town came to visit, and wanted to come here for brunch. So... okay, back to Fresh.  It still didn't win me over.  But this visit was better than before.  Our server was a bit weird, but ultimately helpful and friendly so that's all that matters. One of the other servers \"helping\" the table next to us was terrible and I'm glad we didn't have her. She seemed to be all attitude, and no help.  Brunch was great. I got the pancake platter, which comes with two pancakes of your choice, two vegan breakfast sausages and tofu scramble (for 12$). I could have done without the over-spiced boring tofu scramble, but the pancakes (banana-nut flavoured) were excellent, especially when slathered with margarine and dark rich maple syrup. Tofu sausage was fantastic.  I got an americano.  And while it wasn't a very big cup of coffee, or very caffeinated, it was very tasty.  I also ordered a side of soy yogurt, but really, I wouldn't recommend it. Unless you get some jam. It's not flavoured with anything so when you order soy yogurt that's really all it is, and it's not very good.   Next time (since there will probably always be a next time with this place): BBQ Burger. How can I go wrong with a veggie burger, that also includes a couple of those delicious quinoa onion rings?"}
{"text":"I like a few items on the menu:  Squash tacos Fries Daily soups  And the awesome green candy drink.  I usually grab my   I'm not a fan of the slow service and loud atmosphere but will eat here if I must.  Why does heathy food have to be sooooooo expensive??!!"}
{"text":"Service was super quick and food was so delicious and healthy. What more can you ask for? I'd come back any day."}
{"text":"ok do you guys know that fresh restaurant sells some items  GMO I was told that by a watier an i was very mad because I go there all the time.. and I really thought they celebrate more Farmers Market & local market knowing full well the studies done on genetically modified organism will never go back again tks"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times with friends, and will continue to bring veggie-newbs to check it out as long as it's still standing. On my last trip, another Fresh veteran and I took some carnivores (the kind that can't NOT eat meat) to check it out. They were resistant, but by the time they left they were perhaps the biggest Fresh-fans I've ever encountered. It's that good.  The only thing I will say about Fresh  (just like anywhere) is that you have to manage your expectations. I've read a few reviews on here about how it's loud or crowded or overpriced (it's not), or whatever. Yes, it's loud, and yes, it's crowded, but that's because it's AWESOME and lots of people want to go. My recommendation is to appreciate it for what it is and you will be a certified Fresh-y too."}
{"text":"Slow rude service very busy. The women literally said it has only been twenty five minutes when I asked where the food was. Don't go"}
{"text":"Just visited FRESH and to be honest I can not justify all the noise around it.  There is a nice variety of veggie drinks, smoothies, shakes etc but I could also use a soda.   Food looked good and was good, with good serving portions and you should sure feel full after eating there. However nothing extraordinary and would like to see more options of cooked veggie food, apart from burgers, wraps, salads and rice.  Service was ok, with friendly people serving but quite slow - without doubt it is a busy place but waiting time is more than average.  I had a mushroom burger - was really tasty, would like it more juicy,  onion rings- probably the best  have ever tried - for sure a must  and the sweet potato fries - portion was really big, definitely serves two people but fries were shaggy and too sweet for my taste.  Prices were reasonable for any restaurant though bit expensive for this one considering there is no meat or fish.  Overall I would go again but it is not a place to die for.  Advise for owners - please replace this squeezer / smoothie machine, its noise level is off the roof and gives the place the feeling of a construction site."}
{"text":"They have a large patio to enjoy the final days of the summer. The food was excellent. Although it's vegetarian, meat eaters do not feel like they are missing out."}
{"text":"Three years ago this location was one of my favourite spots to share a bite with friends - we were there a few times a month for sure. Then I moved to Mississauga and didn't frequent the place for a year or so. Things have changed...I am not sure what the reason (chef changed, suppliers changed, etc.) but food that used to be fantastic is mediocre these days and service has seen much better days. I am not too picky about the service but food was a huge disappointment. My mushroom burger was nothing like during Fresh's glory days and they absolutely ruined sweet potato fries...My friend's bowl which he used to order every second time we were there was left unfinished...Unless something changes for the better, I am no longer a fan..."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the food I've had at Fresh.  Today I had the Energy bowl and it was mighty tasty.  However, the tasty food, doesn't really make up for a few things that I find irksome about Fresh.   I wholeheartedly agree with previous reviewers about the prices.  Yes, the portion I got was substantial, but it cost $12.  Dude, that is a tidy sum for what is essentially rice, veggies, tofu, chickpeas and some sauce.  While waiting for my take out order, I perused the menu and noted some ridiculous prices.  Now, I don't know why I never noticed before, but seriously $5.00 for juice? $3.00 for Arranciata?  Kind of insane.  It seems that Fresh may have to go in the treat category for me...though it does seem odd to put this kind of food in the treat category if you know what I mean. Another irksome thing was the to go container.  I had my food in it for maybe half an hour while I took the streetcar / walked home.  When I arrived home the container was a soggy mess and I had to transfer the food to a bowl in order to eat it; thereby ruining my to go fantasy of eating out of the container and watching Being Erica online.  Boo : ("}
{"text":"Probably the tastiest vegan food I've ever had. The onion rings are spectacular!  I strongly recommend this restaurant not only to vegans and vegetarians, but to everyone who enjoys a good quality meal."}
{"text":"I've gone to Fresh for years.   I am always torn if I should spend my money at this place . As a gluten-free vegetarian, you would think this is a god send - right? I make a lot of food like this - but for some reason things that are supposed to be gluten free here still don't sit right with me.   While they have a disclaimer on cross contamination - I am not super strict, and go to many mainstream places with substitutions. So for some reason there is something that is really bothering me here....  I'm pretty sure it has to do with their fryer - they use the same fryer for everything. The fries bother me and the crispy tofu. I think the quinoa onion rings are what contaminates everything. First of all, when they first came out with quinoa onion rings, I was ecstatic! I thought they would be gluten-free (hello quinoa is GF) - but they have spelt in them :( I can't complain as obviously they are not just accommodating gluten-free folks - they are serving vegetarians - and gluten taste good!  BUT had those quinoa onion rings been gluten free - they would not have gluten contamination in the fries and fried tofu! Or if they didn't have just one fryer. I know this sounds a little crazy - but I've had too many onion ring particles in my fries and bowls (that have tofu in them).   SO I recommend if  you are gluten free (not a preference but celiac or intolerant) to specify you want nothing from the fryer. The falafel balls also have gluten (though are traditionally made without wheat).   A couple of other beefs - skimpy on the tofu (the baby bowls get one piece of tofu!! - um tofu is not that expensive). Juices are a little overpriced (not even organic or cold pressed). While the server hipster demeanor has calmed down - still there. Overall overpriced. They don't have a wide selection of gluten-free desserts.   BUT   Definitely fortunate these are around and accommodate us veggies and gluten-free folks. They even have a separate gluten-free menu to make it easier. Your non-veggie friends will even enjoy.   Some recent favorites:   Tiger Bowl (actually a sauce that saturates the whole bowl. I hate dry/hard rice in other bowls in takeout) and the Kale Salad (sub the tempeh bacon). The green juice with Himalayan salt (I think they put TOO MUCH salt in the one I had, but it gave a refreshing kick). The soups (though a tad overpriced). The Tahini dressing is a regular for me."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes and yes. This is one of my favourite vegetarian spots and has been for years. The servers are always nice, the fresh juice and smoothies are delicious and the food is always spot on. Their bowls are incredible and filling, I always have leftovers. My meat eating family and boyfriend actually CRAVE this restaurant which says a lot, they love the burgers (especially the bbq burger). They have a great selection for both vegans and vegetarians, and offer items with and without meat replacements which I think is wonderful.   They also have this great tofu that's different from anything I've had elsewhere. Has no strange tofu flavour, instead it's mild and almost has a hint of smoke. I also prefer this location over the queen/spadina one as I find it's much less busy and has a bit more space thanks to the outside patio. Definitely recommend this place herbivores and omnivores alike!"}
{"text":"The best of the Freshes! This is the place we go to when we don't want to eat out but are too tired to cook. Good, healthy food in a friendly environment at a good price."}
{"text":"amazing vegan food place...food quality is really good and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Fresh used to be called Juice For Life (I think I may have told this story in another Fresh review) and it was up on Bloor.  It smelled like hippy's and the staff were total Bruce Cockburn lesbo-librarian types, and I ate meat.  Now it's called Fresh and there are three locations, and each has their own little identity. Fresh on Crawford is the one that you go too when you're not in a big hurry, you wanna eat outside, you wanna take your time.  The brunch menu is actually pretty fantastic for vegetarians. I remember when I cut eggs and dairy from my diet, I thought I would never eat brunch again, at least nothing good. But they have plenty of dishes with tons of flavor.  The only downside is that they recently fired all the gay female servers. I mean not overtly because they were gay, but it's a bit weird that suddenly only the lesbians were gone.  Ironically, that fact now keeps me out."}
{"text":"After a couple of years hiatus I decided to give Fresh another try.  I have never loved their treatment of food - I find it bland.  I wasn't disappointed - or rather I wasn't surprised.  It was pretty awful.  Terrible service.  A modest amount of veggies on a HUGE clump of soggy, cool, sticky  (bad) soba - way too much to stuff down.  My cat could cook better.  Couldn't get the waiter's attention though she had maybe 5 minutes to chat with a table nearby.  Give it a pass.  Maybe they'll wake up.  They need to respect the diners.  Oh yeah.  They charge a lot for such pathetic offerings."}
{"text":"I've eaten at both the Spadina and Bloor locations and the food is always great.  Never had anything I didn't like at Fresh."}
{"text":"Super healthy and tasty. Great salads to choose from. My boyfriend had a spicy juice that was hot like a soup. Really good for zinging that cold he had. Love the park nearby. If the weather is nice take your food togo and enjoy it outside on a bench with the old trees, row houses and funny black squirrels. Lots of shops and things to do in this neighborhood. I like coming here in the Fall."}
{"text":"Consistent and delicious. If i brought someone I loved here, I'd recommend they get the quinoa onion rings, sweet potato fries with miso gravy, the BBQ burger (because it has onion rings on it), the swoosh, the sweet ginger tea, salads are ridiculously good...I guess I could go on. Sweet spot for a guilt-free meal."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place yet?  It's my go-to spot when I'm feeling like I've gone too long without veggies: a brown rice bowl or the Mediterranean platter are just what I need.  Portions are well-sized--I usually get the small bowls, and they're more than enough for me.  The food's creative and delicious, too, and the patio is an awesome place to sit out and enjoy a lazy Sunday after a boozy night."}
{"text":"Fresh is one of my favourite restaurants in the city for a delicious healthy meal. I usually order one of their salads, which are huge - my favs are the Mega Life salad or Green Destiny Salad - they both come with variations of of greens and tofu cubes, nuts and seeds. You can choose whichever dressing you want -I usually pick the simpler ginger/cilantro.   They also have heartier options, like burritos and burgers - I recommend the BBQ burger - a veggie burger topped with BBQ sauce and onion rings on a whole grain bun. You can also get any of their burgers on greens. The burgers come with a side of slaw, but it's pretty small.    My favourite from the 'bowls' section is the 'Beach' with sweet potato, grilled peppers, avocado and sun dried tomatoes. I recommend the sweet potato fries as well - great with their curry dipping sauce!"}
{"text":"Oh Fresh. Always predictable but satisfying. Good vegetarian food (even for those who do not like vegetarian food).  Of your numerous locations in Toronto, the Trinity Bellwoods location is by far my favourite. Situated on a picturesque corner of Queen West & Crawford, the patio is shadowed by large trees and soundtracked by the rumble of streetcars and hipster bikers cat-calling to each other.  Have been so many times that I have my go to items. Here they are:  Appetizers:  Sweet Potato Fries ($6.50): my favourite in the city, sweet, salty, not too oily.   Quinoa-coated Onion Rings ($5.50): super crunchy, not greasy, these are up there in the best onion rings I have ever ate category  Mains:   Magic Tofu Wrap ($10): great marinated grilled tofu with tomato, lettuce, carrots, red onion, alfalfa sprouts, jicama and garlic vegan mayo. I always add goat cheese to the wrap as well as order a side of the vegan mayo (love it slather the wrap in it, as well as my side of sweet potato fries)  Green Goddess Bowl ($14): when I'm super hungry and want rice, I order this bowl. Brown rice topped with steamed greens including broccoli, kale,  grilled tempah, sunflower seeds, toasted nori, tahini, pickled ginger (which I always omit, I hate the stuff). Super healthy and satisfying  BBQ Burger ($10): veggie burger with BBQ sauce, a quinoa onion ring, banana hot peppers, napa cabbage, letuce, tomato and vegan garlic mayo. So so good (for a meatless burger).  Only issues with Fresh as of late: menu prices keep going up, yet portion sizes stay relatively the same (maybe a bit smaller), the cleanliness of the Queen/Crawford location is becoming an issue, the floors around the kitchen (which u have to cross to get the the washroom) are super grimy and the washrooms tend to always be messy. Also, they need to open a location EAST of the Don Valley. Us east-enders need a good veggie joint!"}
{"text":"Expensive food, but very healthy and always fresh. This place is always packed for lunch when I stop by for takeout orders.  The california classic salad is really tasty."}
{"text":"Holy hell this place is delicious. Take your non-vegan friends and they'll be amazed as well. GO. Now. Go."}
{"text":"Everything from the people, food, drinks, and environment were absolutely lovely! I just wish there was a fresh closer to me. It wonderful being able to pick anything from the menu. What a variety! Even my fiance who is far from vegetarian, loves this place. The potions are huge, and greatly filling, extremely tasty.  There's a selection of organic food as well, along with a few beers.  Can't leave the place unsatisfied."}
{"text":"I was looking for something healthy to eat, and wandered into Fresh on Queen St.  Our server recommended the BBQ burger, which sounded great, but I obviously wasn't listening attentively. I had no Idea that Fresh Modern Food = Vegan food.  If they meant vegan, why wouldn't they just advertise it as a Fresh \"Vegan\" Food?  Anyways, I tried really hard not to like the veggie patty or whatever it was they gave me.  But the goat cheese was just too good and the taste shattered my pre-conceived distaste for vegetarian cuisine.  The sweet potato fries were a nice change and pair well with the Thai Peanut sauce.  Anyways, I found vegan food to be pretty tasty.  Who knew?"}
{"text":"I'm always pretty disappointed with Fresh. I've eaten at all three locations and it's just... alright. I find that it's way overpriced, and that a lot of the food is pretty bland. Last time I went, I had an espresso shake ($7!!!!) and it sounded really good, but it was just okay. Meh.  Although I have to say that the patio at this location is really sweet."}
{"text":"The service was terrible.  I love the menu and the concept of this place. BUT I ordered a salad and they didn't even give me the tofu that was supposed to come with it!  Quinoa onion rings were very good as usual!"}
{"text":"I've been to Fresh twice and both times I loved it.  The portions are good sized, the food tastes... Fresh :o) and the service is decent.    I had the Beach bowl which I thought was DEE-lish and also the macro bowl.  Both very satisfying and yummy."}
{"text":"I've frequented the Spadina location numerous times but it's only my second time here. The menu is the same but space is a little smaller. It was absolutely packed and you typically have to wait in line.   I love the food from the \"bowls\" to wraps to salads. All delicious."}
{"text":"Although I'm a vegan and I love supporting all the vegan-friendly places in the city, I'm honestly unable to say that this is one of them. I do occasionally eat at Fresh but it's usually when I'm being dragged there by a group of people who have out-voted me (and usually who haven't eaten there before might I add). It used to be good, really really good. Back in the days when there was one restaurant on Bloor and there was an Urban Cowboy sandwich which still makes me drool at the memory. Those were the days. But as with all good things, eventually their time passes and that always seems to be when they turn into a larger enterprise.  Their juices are still lovely although waiting for one to go may take ages. Their baked goods are good, although highly overpriced compared to other places that serve the exact same product (go see Sadie's Diner at Adelaide and Portland for the same baked yummies for less). But I have found that in the past few years the food is either bland or waaaay to oily (ahem, Dragon Bowl that actually made my hunny sick it was so oily). The waiters are apathetic and sometimes rude, seating is RAMMED (you will be sharing dinner with your neighbors, and if you have a lot of parcels and stuff with you I wish you luck) and the service is also quite slow (even if it's not rammed).   If you are going to eat here, if you are determined to do so, I have a fall back dish that doesn't seem to be too bad no matter the location that you go to. And that would be the Holiday wrap ladies and gentlemen. It's not too oily, it's hard to screw up, and I also may recommend that you add Tempeh for some extra protein.  The only thing that I LOVE on their menu are their sweet potato fries served with miso gravey. And if you remember Fresh in the old days and want to recapture days gone by, snap up the first cook book. It has all the recipes that were well-loved back in the day.  But honestly, if you want some really good vegan and vegetarian eats or are taking out your carnivorous friends to experience all that meat-free dishes have to offer, there are soooo many better places to go than here."}
{"text":"I had the ninja bowl and it was ... meh. The service is superb though!  I am someone who prefers to eat healthy or vegetarian but the food just didn't blow me away. I much prefer hibiscus in Kensington.   However, honorable mentions for the hot sauce. At all of the fresh restaurants, instead of a chili sauce, they do more of a hot curry sauce. It is definitely unique and worth trying."}
{"text":"Bad ass vegan food. Dope smoothies, vibrant flavours. The one must go to for me me everytime I hit Toronto."}
{"text":"Monday night wait was surprisingly long.  Plan ahead.  Food was excellent, although surprisingly pricey given that there is no meat.   Wasn't given the option by the server to order the smaller bowl, and therefore ended up with the larger bowl which was far too much food.  Ended up taking a lot of the food home with me."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed.  I'm not a vegetarian but I do love my veggies.  I've eaten here many times and have rarely been disappointed.  Today I can't say the same.  I ordered my usual Beach Bowl and instead of eating in, I opted for take out.  First off - they changed the packaging making the take out portion for the standard size that much smaller.  When I got home I saw that I got a bigger portion of soba noodles with little veggies.  I got two small pieces of grilled red peppers, two small slices of grilled sweet potatoes, two small slices of avocado and some greenery.  I don't know what is happening with this restaurant, but they are on the cusp of losing a customer in me.  You'd think that with the increase in price they would keep the portions the same, but that is not the case."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Fresh. Their food is amazing and they're pretty reasonably priced - like their burgers are pretty large!   I been to the Fresh on Bloor several of time and always have the best experiences there. This location of Fresh is near Trinity Bellwoods Park/Queen St. West, where I frequent for shopping and just casual walking around. I have stopped at this location in two occasions - the food is the same as the one on Bloor, the service is still great, but this location is quite tiny compared to the Bloor St. location. The wait here (around the busy hours of lunch and/or dinner) is usually around 20 minutes on both occasions. Since it's quite chilly outside, everyone is standing inside and it gets very, very crowded, along with people coming in and out for their take out orders.   However, the wait might not be a problem during the summer since I believe they have outdoor seating. It's settled on the side street, so you can observe the busy streets, but not be completely disturbed with people walking so nearby ever so often.   Since the seating is limited, I find it not that preferable for groups to come. The seating is usually setting two by twos. It best to come in pairs during the congested time, but if it's probably the middle of the day, it would be fine bringing a larger group.   Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Completely vegetarian restaurants are a rare find in the cities I've lived in, so I was smitten with Fresh when I visited Toronto. I'm so used to skimming a menu to look for the three vegetarian items they have, which is usually at least one appetizer, salad and pasta. It took me ten minutes to decide at Fresh because everything looked so good. I ended up getting the Dragon bowl on brown rice. It was delicious, filling and I left the restaurant without feeling grossly heavy.   However, the prices were a little steep and it's annoying that you have to pay $2 extra if you want cheese in your wrap or on your hamburger. I also didn't enjoy that they cycled the same hippy hipster CD twice while I was there."}
{"text":"I really dig this place. This location has great outdoor seating too.   Their bowls are perfect, huge, tasty, and can be ordered on rice, soba noodles, or without in exchange for more veggies (my choice). I've tried and loved the beach bowl, the energy bowl, and the macro bowl. Friends also rave about the dragon and buddha bowls.  Last time there we ordered their yam fries, which are covered in some highly addictive herb and salt combination. Be. Warned.  So good."}
{"text":"We always make sure to stop in here when in town. There are so many locations making it convenient to grab a healthy, fresh bite in Toronto. Love their juices and the cookbook is nice to make some of their menu items at home."}
{"text":"Fresh is a pretty good vegan restaurant. They have a decent selection of food, even though I think that a lot of it overpriced.   That being said, the food that I've had thus far is pretty tasty: the bbq burger, the magic tofu wrap, the onion rings, some sort of a bean burrito, and the falafel plate, although it didn't have much in it for the price that it was.   I've had both good and bad experiences at Fresh... Hence the 3 star rating. I remember getting a glass of water that smelled like an old rag, so that had me slightly concerned and grossed out. I also do not recommend the simple bowl---it really is simple, and it is pretty much just heaps of carrots on top of brown rice.   Every time I try to go to Fresh it's packed with people, so that tells ya something."}
{"text":"I am only giving one star because there is no option to leave none. I have gone to Fresh for my last time-again, but this time for good.  If it weren't for the fact that I was starving and next door-I would never have walked in.  I frequented Fresh for about 10 years, putting up with snotty servers, slow service, inconsistent food and terrible cafeteria atmosphere because honestly the food is tasty.  In the past, there have been countless times I've had to point out forgotten ingredients and wait for nearly an hour for a my meal.  I went in this time to order a salad-something high protein and low carb for my very strict diet.  I was informed that I could not choose my own salad topper-it had to be the one I didn't want.  I don't like goji berry and I can't have quinoa but apparently I either had to have it or omit it and add the one I wanted at a charge.    I was told by a snide, but delighted server that 'they are strict about substitutions'.  Right, because putting the nut topper instead of the salad topper is a highly engaging feat of expertise which can't be managed with 3 tables in the house.   I know many restaurants that have a substitution policy and especially in peak times this makes sense.  But you know what Fresh, being strict without wavering in these rules only ensures angry customers.  These policies are generally in place to prevent customers from completely changing a dish and causing undue work for an already minimum wage kitchen.  They should not be to provide an opportunity for staff to be condescending belligerents because a customer wishes not to have goji berries.  As someone who is extremely open to all vegan food but goji's-this is just offensive.   Yes Fresh may have this policy, but soup nazi servers do not do anything to ease the impact.  Further, a restaurant may say they aren't interested in customers who really don't want to eat their food as they intend it.  But if they believe in enforcing a strict rule about what types of condiments I can have on my food, they've defeated their purpose, which is to feed many people with varying tastes-you've taken it too far!!!  So if you must go, know that only the food will be savored, the rest is just sour (soy) milk and always has been."}
{"text":"An incredibly wonderful place. The soup of the day was delicious (and the bowl was huge too), the baguette was crispy and cappuccino with goji berries was extraordinary. But what I liked most were personalised items e.g. glass water bottles & sugar."}
{"text":"The squash tacos are to die for!  The customer service was amazing from Matt, Trevor and Ethan. They gave great recommendations and went out of their way.  They were super friendly and happy.  Ethan told me the company has a great cookbook and they are very conscious....I have the first one but need to get the second cookbook...thanks Fresh on Crawford team"}
{"text":"My friend and I are vegetarian and thought Fresh was a great idea for a niceThursday lunch to celebrate his recent promotion. He got the 'Beach' bowl for $14, which was supposed to have fried zucchini and peppers, dried tomatoes, sprouts and avodado on a bed of brown rice.   Now, if someone comes over your house and you're cooking for them, you don't just put a bunch of cut ingredients in a bowl and serve it, do you? No, you do something with it -- cut up the veggies, toss it, add some sort of spices or flavouring, etc. Instead they serve the saddest looking restaurant meal we had ever seen: just some uncut cooked veggies on a bed of very oily brown rice. Unappetizing to say the least.  I myself got the bbq veggie burger. It was uninspring, but nothing I can complain about too much -- basically just a normal veggie burger. I also asked if they could put a bit of red onion on my burger because I love red onion and noticed it didn't have it.  My friend then decides to order fries to fill himself up because his meal is so bad. Somehow, they also messed up the fries, which were still raw in the middle. We were quite fed up by this point and sent them back.  Finally, the bill comes and they've had the nerve to charge $2 for a bit of red onion on my burger. Apparently, $10 for a veg burger without fries wasn't enough, and the red onion counted as a 'side.' Earning loyal customers right there they are.  This was the final straw. We call the manager over and explain the list of complaints, with the point that after all that the last thing they should be charging for is $2 two raw red onion rings. She brusquely replies, \"Well if you didn't like your meal you should have told us and we'd take it off.  As for the onions, it's an extra and that's $2.\" Two things about this. First off, we all get bad meals in restaurants, and very few of us send it back. It's just something that happens. Second of all, you shouldn't mess up fries no matter what. Third of all, any restaurant that wants customer loyalty should not charge their customers $2 for a bit of onion on a burger. And if they do, warn the customer when they order as a courtesy.  Mediocre/bad food, and no sense of customer service. Avoid."}
{"text":"Love the food here. Service is always great. I never leave disappointed. I wish they'd bring back the cauliflower wings, they're so good!"}
{"text":"i've been coming to fresh since 2005 since majority of my friends opt to dine here for the healthy choices. i can say that at first i was addicted to the magic tofu wrap but no longer does it catch my attention. the space is small, everyone is sitting really close to one another so you will not get an intimate dining experience if you are seeking one. instead you will be able to hear the conversation of the person next to you quite clearly. it's not child friendly either from what i've noticed - with tables that close and a child at one, well it's just a matter of time before the child gets curious and ends up at your table. the soups here aren't great. the ones i've had have arrived moderately cold and were flavorless.  i'm a huge fan of sweet potato fries and this place tends to overcook them. they often come half burnt which takes away from the creamy sweet flavor. the wraps aren't bad but once more, they come lukewarm so if you are looking for something hot, opt for the burger or a noodle bowl. my favorite dish consists of their yummy springrolls. they are fairly large and can be eaten as a main course.   this place isn't bad but it's not great, just like what the stars describe, it's A-OK. the food is generally flavorless unless you ask for specific ingredients (in which you pay extra) but the juices and smoothies are great though pricy. my favorite is their beet juice. sometimes i buy the large bottle version of it when i want to splurge because it's overpriced for what it is. however, it's light and a great breakfast drink."}
{"text":"I do not get it.   I guess you can just be really healthy and people will line up (they do). But I've had so many bad experiences here. From bad service to bad food. Fries that are burnt beyond recognition. Hot cucumber in my wraps. Basically it feels like you're eating the same ingredients in every dish.   I like that date almond smoothie though."}
{"text":"Menu has several options to choose from.  The wrap and fries did not disappoint.  A good sized patio with numerous customers."}
{"text":"Service was 8/10. Waitresses are all those hot vegan hipster types - which I'm super attracted to / annoyed by. Duality of man.  Fresh makes healthy food enjoyable.  Fresh makes less healthy food (yet still veg) even more enjoyable.  I had the BBQ Burger with onion rings on it. I saw a lot of people with this dish. It looks good and it tastes good, too.   Sweet potato fries come out in a hugeeeeeeee bowl and are also delish."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Toronto, I must come to Fresh. It's a west coast concept but there's still nothing like this in Vancouver. It would blow up there.  It's vegetarian without compromising on taste, vegan- and gluten-free friendly, tons of add-on options, big portions, reasonably priced, and awesome service. I'm not vegetarian and I love their food. For starters, definitely cornbread. Sweet potato fries are also amazing. I usually go for a fresh bowl (either dragon, energy or buddha) on soba noodles and the baby size is enough for me for lunch. Add a cup of soup if you're hungrier and voila. A protein-packed meal without the heaviness. Their most popular dish is probably their All Star salad bowl. Can't go wrong with that.  And if you have specific dietary restrictions, they have substitutions for each menu item and they don't look at you like you're crazy. I could eat here every day. I'm serious."}
{"text":"Went to Fresh on a Saturday afternoon and found myself elbow to elbow on both sides of the table. The restaurant was bustling with people, but I guess that's expected when you come in for lunch on a weekend. We ordered the curried chick pea dosas as a starter and it was fantastic. The coconut curry sauce is so delicious I had to stop myself from practically licking the plate clean. As a main, I had the Buddha bowl on soba noodles and was mildly disappointed because the sauce was a bit too lemon-y for my liking. The veggies were fresh and the marinated tofu cubes were firm without being tough or chewy. I'm glad I ordered the \"baby\" Buddha bowl since the portion sizes are quite large and I didn't end up finishing my plate. I will definitely be back here for round two soon."}
{"text":"Had a veggie burger. Wow! So tasty. It had onion rings on it too, which I don't usually like. These were really good though. It is quite filling, you don't even need a side with it."}
{"text":"I really can't say much more than what others have said about this place, as they are spot on in my opinion.  The burgers were good, I've had better, but not too often.  The bowls are awesome and a lot of choice.  There are so many sides and options, essentially a made-to-order restaurant.  I love the concept of Fresh and the food does not make you feel heavy or anything afterward, and you are still quite full.  This is one of those places you could eat A LOT and never get bored.  Maybe that's why it was so crowded!  I guess I'm not the first one to think that.  But it is a great addition to the Toronto vegan scene, a trendy and healthy and unique dining experience, one that I look forward to when in Toronto."}
{"text":"I'm not vegetarian or vegan but also not opposed to trying any restaurant. Came by for a healthy meal after a workout class. It was a lovey summer evening but unfortunately the restaurant was extremely busy. I would have loved to sit on their patio but we were starving so we opted for a seat inside. Ordered their onion rings along with the Buddha bowl. The onion rings were fantastic and lived up to all the hype. The Buddha bowl was delicious too. The portion was huge. I ended up taking half of it home and ate it for lunch the next day. If you're looking for a healthy meal that's filling this is the place."}
{"text":"I LOVE the food here.   Like the name suggests, everything is fresh and delicious. The portions are generous, everything is full of flavour, and pretty healthy. You really can't go wrong, especially with any of their bowls.  I love dining in here but it's also one of my favourite places to get takeout from. I only wish their prices were a little better so that I could justify coming here more often."}
{"text":"Stopped by Fresh on our way back to the B&B after a long day of walking, shopping, getting rained on, walking some more, and deciding that we were ready to get out of the city and back into the woods for the final leg of our honeymoon.  Neither of us are fully vegetarian, but we both eat vegetarian 5 days out of the week easily, so this place would be fitting if it were anywhere near us.  We simply wanted somewhere to rest and perhaps something sweet, so we sat on the patio (Vanessa is right, trendy area and good for people watching), recapped our crazy day and had a piece of vegan chocolate cake followed by some decaf americano.  The servers were cool, the menu looked really good with all vegetarian and lots of vegan choices as well.  Smoothies, espresso, asian, etc. etc., a really cute place that we'll have to try if I can ever convince my wife to go back - she's not a big city girl."}
{"text":"I find the place pricey for items, like $12 for a big salad and $8 for a detox drink which both can be made at home for a fraction of the price.  However, when you want something healthy when eating out, there's not too many choices in the neighbourhood.  The service is great here, they greet you immediately at the door and seem genuinely warm and friendly with the customers.    The California Salad is my favourite thing here, it's a mixture of greens and a variety of nuts that provide just the right amount of crunch texture with each bite.  Be warned though that if you aren't a regular heavy veggie eater, your body will take some time adjusting to the copious amount of fibre the rest of the day if you catch my drift...."}
{"text":"As much hype surrounds this now popular chain of restaurants, I always find something not quite spot on during my visits.   - The portions are very sizeable for the price (yes you pay $15 but you could easily split the regular-sized salads or bowls into two meals) - My favourites have so far been the quinoa onion rings and the crispy squash tacos - both very delicious and consistently good - The new phytosalad is delish (the 369 dressing is mmm) but the soba noodles were overcooked in my opinion (they aren't suppose to be soggy..) and for some reason they served this dish on a plate..Perhaps I'm just being picky but I do think dish choice is important to consider for dining experience. It's a great salad but it should be in a bowl like all the others!  - I saw a strange bug on my taco's lime today eep! :S Thankfully I don't really need lime for my tacos but that is a little bit gross to encounter (I wish it was because the lime was so fresh from the garden!)  - Unfortunately I'm not a big fan of Fresh smoothies or juices... I've gotten a number of different ones and they are always lacking balance in flavours. The only one I can actually recommend would be The Daily Dose cold-pressed juice (the beet, fennel and himalayan salt is a unique but refreshing taste). The lemonade is way too lemony and no way my stomach could handle drinking the full 16oz.  In general though Fresh is a great option in most of the neighbourhoods it resides in for when you want to eat-out but be a bit more healthy conscious."}
{"text":"Came in sat down and nobody took our damn order for a bad 10 mins. I understand they are busy but i hate it when some one just came in and they already start eating while Me and my wife still waiting for our food. Well that was my experience here, im sorry. I love fresh and i will still come back but not on this location anymore."}
{"text":"Horrible service , I ride my bike.. I look like a courier kinda cuz I have a fucking beard.. so nobody asks me if I want a table even though im looking veryone dead in the eye like \"hi gimme a table\" I ask for a table .. there nobody here mind you.. I go sit down nobody gives me a Menu.. I had to ask for a menu.. all the servers ignore me. 15 minutes later someone asks me if i want to order now I'm just pissed"}
{"text":"Don't act so surprised. It's not like I wasn't going to eat at my favourite restaurant at least a half dozen times while in Toronto. I did warn you didn't I?!?!?   After an afternoon of shopping, my girlfriends and I were famished. Lucky for us, this location of Fresh was in the vicinity. I ordered the Super Protein Salad (surprise, surprise) and we shared yam fries, soup and cornbread. I had never tried the cornbread or the soup before and I gotta say - they were DAMMMMN good! I could have eaten an entire loaf of their cornbread but don't worry... I practised safe snacking ;)   The service was good and luckily I've never had any problems with Fresh on that front either.   Overall, still my favourite restaurant in Toronto.   Now just one problem remains: How am I going to make it through the next few months without my daily fix of Fresh???"}
{"text":"Are you a vegan? Vegetarian?  Trying win over reluctant, carnivorous family and friends?  Take 'em to Fresh.  Been there twice -- everything I tried was really good.  Choices galore.  The 'baby' buddha bowl had tons of veg, rice, curry, crispy tofu, and peanut sauce.  Quinoa onions rings with chipotle dip were great.  My complete carnivore husband loved the black bean burrito with soy cheese.   Prices are okay for really well prepared food, decent portions, nice wait staff.  It's not fine dining but it's a great segue into tasty, satisfying vegan food.."}
{"text":"Great patio lunch location. Loved their immunity shots, highly recommend the ginger shot before eating to stimulate healthy digestion. Everything I've tried here has been rad so far so just ask the server for advice and trust your instincts. I love the bbq burger, Allstar salad and Budda bowl. They have a huge menu so should be easy to find something for everyone regardless of dietary restrictions/preferences. Love the sauces served with the share platters too, especially the house hotsauce."}
{"text":"Unless you are a devout vegetarian or vegan you will likely be disappointed by this place."}
{"text":"See my general review here: http://www.yelp.com/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.ca%2Fbiz%2Ffresh-toronto%23hrid%3ABbeAK6nDbHB_6IhLXQChaQ  * Location note: this location's a bit off my radar now, although it was the first I ever visited when I was visiting Toronto. I think it's got a much nicer patio option than Spadina's street-fronting one, and the decor seems a little classier. Some nice window seats too, if I recall correctly."}
{"text":"Came here last week after visiting once before a year prior.   Hands down the food is great. Bowl portions are generous. I didn't give it 5 stars because on a Sunday at 3pm - while the place wasn't particularly packed - I felt slightly rushed. I don't think the waitress intended for that to be the case but I felt like we were checked in on too often. My bowl was still full and I was asked 3 times if I was done.   I'll be back because the food is great and service was wonderful too as everyone is friendly. Maybe it was just too cold outside and I was a bit hypersensitive."}
{"text":"Food is great.  Everytime we're in, the service starts out very cold/distant/almost snobbish and in the end becomes a fun and memorable occasion, interesting. The patio is one of the better in the city. I always feel like there's a good seat out there, or we're lucky."}
{"text":"First part of my review should be a 4 star, second should be a 1-2 star.  I love the tiger bowl (no tofu, no cashews, extra cabbage & chili oil) with basmati rice. I would give that dish a 5+!  It's got wicked good flavour, the cabbage is grilled nicely and the chili oil gives it a nice bit of spice. The 3,6,9 sauce is amazing - i could do shots of it!  My low star rating at Fresh is because of the juice.  It is over priced for what you get. We had an immune elixir, urgen-c and a green juice, all green.  Both were so watered down they tasted awful.  I drink a lot of fresh juice so I know how it should taste.  The juices they make are pricey and not even organic.  I'll never buy fresh juice here again...  too bad."}
{"text":"This is a nice, healthy, dare I say fresh lunch spot! They have a lot of great lunch combos and deals for fair pricing and good portion sizes. My fave thing about this location is there patio is lovely. It has an amazing view of the trinity bellwoods a park and is pretty big for along queen! All menue items are well made with great ingredients and always makes me feel healthy yelp even though I'm eating out!e"}
{"text":"I really went nuts for Fresh this week. My boyfriend asked me to get him take out at Fresh while he had a hang over on Sunday. I'd never been to Fresh before but after I ordered and payed for his food I was a little shocked that a Magic Tofu wrap and sweet potato fries ran me $16 and change. No wonder he asked me to get it for him when I offered to deliver some hang over remedies. I got to eat a bite of this wrap which was fantastic.  So fantastic in fact I suckered my dad in to taking me here for lunch on my birthday where I proceeded to order the magic tofu wrap and the quinoa onion rings. I found our server to be fine, however I heard her make snarky comments to a few customers, one woman who was getting take out when the server brought the take out she was on her phone and took her meal and as she walked out the waitress gave her a snarky \"YOUR WELCOME\". This same server also proceeded to hug another male server constantly behind the coffee bar which was a little weird.   This place is really good if someone else is paying for it. However if you are paying for it its a lil pricey. So find some sucker to buy you Fresh."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch - table for 2 so no reservation possible. Wait was about 20 minutes. We ordered the cornbread as a starter - toasted and warm, was nice! We got the combo of soup, salad and cornbread and the Buffalo wrap as mains. Soup of the day was a spicy tomato soup which was indeed spicy - but good! Salad was ok, nothing special. Buffalo wrap wasn't really nice. A lot of lettuce and carrot. Barely any 'chicken'. Staff was nice but the food took Some time to arrive. Overall ok but wouldn't wait for 20 minutes again."}
{"text":"Do not sit on the heated patio in winter unless you are dressed for wind and cold. The heat lamps are a bit too high to reach the tables and once you've ordered you can only move inside if you cancel your order and re-add your name to the waitlist which is like no restaurant policy I've ever heard of. The bar was busy so we didn't get our drinks until then the food came and the service was medium - we had to flag servers down a few times for things. The food was mostly good. The Poutine was excellent as was the superfoods salad - I loved the 3-6-9 dressing. The banana split milkshake was amazing. The cornbread was okay but would have been better warm and the cashew cheese tasted more like a hummus spread and was a bit bland but really nice with salt and cayenne added (which you can ask for). The hot sauce was also great.   I'd go again but research the food items other people recommend and definitely sit inside!!!"}
{"text":"If you're a vegetarian or vegan, there's zero excuse for not stopping here.  The food is incredible and I left stuffed both times we went this week.  Literally, flavor explosions in my mouth.  Damn!  Sooooooooooo good.  Hot servers too."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goddess.  I just wolfed down a burger special with a vegan burger patty (called Beyond) that was so like and yet better the 'real' thing I was wondering whether someone switched out my patty for actual beef in some cruel joke.  Nope, I checked, I took bits of the patty apart and it looks like some sort of soy-based protein that is naturally coloured pinkish (not food colouring) and browns lightly like a patty. This is revolutionary!  I've had places that successfully mimicked and excelled beyond things like curry chicken and pork belly, but this is the one that will make the mainstream want to get on board. I would show you a photo, but I finished before I knew what hit me, one of the rare times I finish my food before my partner.  Make sure to get them before the special ends, although I hope they make this patty their standard!"}
{"text":"I usually order pick up from this location! I highly recommend the superfood salad or the mega life or the phytosalad for something a bit light. (The phytosalad has a beautiful presentation). The tangled thai is something I also recommend if you want something satisfying but guilt free. Don't skip on their hot sauce (the brownish looking one). It tastes amazing and unlike any other restaurant I've been too. Seriously, Fresh is worth going to for the hot sauce. My boyfriend and I also order onion rings which are huge and crunchy.  For dressings, their peanut lime sauce and 369 sauce are definitely filling. Carrot miso is oil free and excellent if you don't want to feel heavy afterwards.  Serving sizes are quite big, and are always presented beautifully. Whoever said salads were boring? If you have doubts about getting full off a salad, try their fresh bowls. They're pretty big as well and are excellent, but my friends usually can't finish them. Something in between is their fresh macrobowl, just order the vegetables without the rice or soba noodles for something a bit heartier and warm and more filling.  Call ahead if you want an order to go! (Especially on lunch breaks). It takes about 20 minutes to prepare."}
{"text":"I really loved this busy place! I am not a fan of salad but tried it anyway and it was amazing. I ordered a salad called \"ironman\" and it was really good. I would highly recommend this place and come back to this place."}
{"text":"Always delicious food and great customer service!!  Quinoa onion rings are soo good! Along with the beach bowl and tangled Thai!  I also love their smoothies with vega protein added!  I once ordered a large beach bowl through Uber eats and got a baby size instead. I called them up and they said no problem you'll get a free large size beach bowl the next time you come in!  I also once ordered a small green smoothie with two scoops of protein added. I guess the cup size is to small for two scoops so they happily upgraded my smoothie size for free!  Always a great experience!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to fill yourself up with some healthy choices.  They have lots of different items to choose from including freshly squeezed juices   Make sure you give yourself some time since you'll likely have to wait for a table.   The seating is tight but the staff is friendly.   Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I like Fresh. I love their Buddah bowl, burgers, miso gravy and smoothies... the price is a little, well pricey, but I've never left unsatisfied. I'm a full-fleged carni and I've enjoyed a number of their dishes and recommend it to guests I have in from out of town. Service is so-so and so-slow.. SO my roomates and I invested in the cook book. It's fabulous, has all of my favourite dishes and easy (and much cheaper) to prepare at home."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've visited Fresh. The first time I asked for a cheek pea burger with sweet potato fries that blowed my palate. Today, thanks to the 17*C + plus our bike ride, I felted like something 'fresher'.  I was about to ask for a salad, when I started to watch the yelper pics. The pic of the Jerusalem bowl winked me; however, when I read that the Beach bowl included grilled sun dried tomatoes, red peppers, zucchini, avocado, sweet potato, sunflower sprouts, tamari, and your choice between: rice\soba and grilled tofu/goat cheese, I got engaged...  My husband asked for the BBQ almond burger with a salad.  Although the place wasn't crowded, the service was a lil slow (took like 15-20 min to the waiter to come with the food). Time we used to enjoy a cold organic Miller beer.  My husband liked his burger very much, he just complained about the size of his salad (it was in those tiny metal containers restaurants use for ketchup or mustard...).  I had no complain at all about my Beach bowl, and I really recommend it, I finished every single item.  I also liked the colour, decoration, and presentation of the washrooms (unisex). They display graffiti frames in the hallway.  We'll be back, and I'm going to try one of those herbs elixirs they prepare."}
{"text":"For me this place is a hit and miss. I love the food but the service isn't always the best. I am also stickler for cleanliness and it's sad to say this place is questionable.  I hope it improves"}
{"text":"Food is amazing as is the location and decor. The only problem is staff can be rude. I asked to be seated when the restaurant was half empty. My server thoughtfully brought me to the table in the very back by the kitchen. I refused it and was given a central table. Also, wait staff rarely remember special request even simple ones like no salad dressing. Other than that it would be a five star review!"}
{"text":"I frequent this place often.  I always get the quinoa onion rings.  Super crispy and very tasty with the home made dips.  I did try the mushroom gravy which is great but perhaps not great with crispy onion rings. I think one of the mayo like dips are better for it.  Our waitress told us that her favourite was the Squash Tacos so I took her suggestion and ordered that to share.  It may now become my regular order.  It was so good with so much flavours - cilantro jalpeno lime sauce with crispy squash and tomato/onion/kale topping.  I also shared the Jerusalem bowl which was good as well.    I also recommend asking for the little jar of hot sauce. Very tasty!  The bathrooms in the basement were down when i went and the only working one was a single unit on the main floor.  It was a bit dark and could use a \"re-fresh\".    The patio is classy looking now.  But I liked it before as our dog who was on the other side of the patio was able to see us better before.  Now she jumps up on the barrier to try to look at us.  Staff is nice and gave us a bowl of water for our dog.    Price wise - it's pretty reasonable when the quality of the foods that you get is perfect and good quality veggies.  They take extra care in ensuring that everything that goes in the plate / bowl looks great and taste great."}
{"text":"Nice healthy options in a clean cafe/outdoor patio. I got the two piece cornbread and hummus appetizer to go ($3.15)   The two pieces or cornbread were really small, it's actually one piece cut in two. The hummus doesn't have a strong garlic flavour; it was lumpy and mild in flavour. The cornbread was crunchy, with a lot of corn taste, it's like eating corn meal. It's not gluttony or sweet at all. But for me, the bread was so crumbly, it disintegrates when I dip it into the hummus. Overall it's a good little snack."}
{"text":"Fresh has a decent gluten-free menu.   Basically, the kitchen will leave out certain ingredients to accommodate a gluten allergy--such as a burrito or wrap without the tortilla, or a salad without the marinated tofu. So this isn't the kind of gluten-free restaurant where celiacs can take pleasure in enjoying the foods (such as pancakes or burgers with buns) that they enjoyed before their diagnosis.  But the gluten-free experience at Fresh isn't like ordering a  \"gluten-free grilled cheese sandwich\" and being given a slice of cheese with a tomato.  Fresh is sensitive to gluten allergies, and it serves (true to its name) fresh, solid food.   I enjoyed the black bean tostada and fresh bowl of vegetables and rice.  My friend had the whole wheat banana nut pancakes (obviously not gluten free) and vegan sausages. The pancakes were thick and very tasty, served with a wonderful Maple Syrup, the real deal, not watered down sugar.She also had a  cappuccino which used a wonderful, roasted (not bitter) coffee. In addition, the service is friendly.  Two after-thoughts: (1) Be aware that the restaurant's fries are cooked in same fryer as gluten. (2)  You have to ask for a list of the gluten-free items because they are not flagged on the regular menu."}
{"text":"Whether I'm being dragged to a veggie restaurant with a vegetarian friend, or just in the mood for eating \"healthy\" I usually end up at Fresh.  Although the service is almost always painfully slow, the food usually pretty good. My major complaint (along with most of the other reviews I've read) is that Fresh is extremely over-priced. Theres no need to be spending $20 for lunch, at a vegetarian restaurant. Other than that, the sweet potato fries are great, as well as the \"Magic Tofu Wrap.\" I've recently tried the onion rings which are also great."}
{"text":"Better than the Spadina site in terms of ambience and service imo. All the staff tonight were super caring (and hip - omg my server wore retro overalls, so cute!) and were not intrusive yet still checked on me enough times such that I didn't have to wait around for food or the bill. This location is much quieter and romantic than the site downtown, so it's perfect for date nights. There's also a bar where you can sit at and dine if you're alone. Same menu and grab and go items. Portions are smaller compared to the Fresh Eglinton site (the best by far). Location is super close to the Trinity Bellwoods Park, so very convenient brunch/lunch/dinner site if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Fresh is a great chain of vegan restaurants that will surprisingly fill-up even the biggest carnivore. I was pretty skeptical about the all vegan menu but there is definitely something on their for every taste and budget. I love the soup, salad and cornbread combo which at $9  (for lunch of dinner) is a pretty sweet deal. Their soups are a safe bet and the corn bread is absolutely scrumptious. The salads are also chock-full of veggie goodness and covered in mouth-watering homemade dressings.  If you want a really filling meal, try their tasty veggie burgers or noodle bowls! The desserts (most are gluten free) are also worth a try. I would avoid the smoothies though as they tend to taste a bit weird.  The big patio at Fresh located on Queen West is a great place to munch on lunch or dinner and offers great view for people watching in the trendy Trinity Bellwoods area."}
{"text":"Yes I love fresh and all of their locations. Always good food. My only complaint would be that at this location I always have issues with servers getting my order wrong, last time I asked for rice but they gave me soba noodles... which I didn't love plus I think it's $3 extra... Otherwise their food is great and I love the patio at this location!"}
{"text":"Vibrant veganism. Ginger tea is lovely served in bistro glass. Baby Buddha bowl with brown rice and peanut sauce arrived quickly. Busy and noisy but healthy and quick.  I come here often. The food is healthy. The staff, however, need to be more accommodating. I came to pick up some take out for someone who is ill. I asked if I could sit and have a tea and snack while I waited. It is their policy to not seat take-out patrons and I understand that ... But I am a regular patron and the place was empty. There were five serving staff in the front and only two tables occupied but no one even offered a glass of water while I waited. Not cool."}
{"text":"Shared two regular bowls, quinoa onion rings (amazing!) and poutine between three of us (and we were all very hungry) & it was too much, so the portions are big. Everything was very tasty. Quite pricey but I don't mind paying more sometimes for really good quality food."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a vegetarian and vegan restaurant, here is the best place. I usually drink the fresh prepared juices."}
{"text":"One star for carrying some really great brands of espresso, one star for having lots of vegan food options on the menu (which i didn't try at this location, but they are there, nonetheless.) minus a million stars for shitty service of epic proportions. $9 for a \"shake\" that was the consistency of water, bitter, and virtually undrinkable.  For that much money, and the word \"shake\", i was expecting something slightly thick, and slightly sweet.  Not coffee/barf flavored bong water.  When the person at the counter was quietly and apologetically told that the drink was \"disgusting\" (the only word that could be used to describe it, seriously, but it was said as nicely as possible), they didn't care, but did let us know that they TOO thought it was gross. \"well, I can add more caramel if you want.\"   say what? you're not even going to a) apologize or b) offer to make something else? oh, hell no.   i get that this place might be sort of 'hip', because its a veg place and all, but the people working there aren't even good looking, don't have sweet tattoos, and aren't fashionable enough to pull that hipper-than-thou, i don't give a fuck, i'm cooler than you, attitude.  Especially not to people who ARE good looking, DO have sweet tattoos, and are adorable, paying customers.   learn to smile and learn to give a fuck. you'll get repeat business, and better tips."}
{"text":"Although their menu is delicious, their prices are barely worth it.  Used as a treat now and then, but $6 for a small bowl of soup isn't very practical to me."}
{"text":"I go to Fresh as a last resort if I need a meal on the run, However, I wouldn't choose to eat at Fresh for a night out or meeting some friends.  The food is decent vegan food and I'm thankful for that but it is too pricy for what it is.   The place itself is too small. The tables are crammed together, you are literally having a meal with the table beside you. Good luck if you are carrying any bags or items with you! No privacy. Too loud to chat.   Sadly, this place has become a 'scene' full of hipsters. If you are not a hipster (which most of you do not identify yourself as one) I guess this is the true test - If you are truely not a hipster - you will feel alienated. Be prepared to feel like you stand out. This place is full of hipsters.   A nice example would be a comment I once received by an employee at Fresh - \"Oh you're vegan? You don't look like a vegan.\"  :)"}
{"text":"As someone who enjoys the consumption of meat, I was assured that this place would make me a fan of vegetarian cuisine. As a challenge, I decided to try out what they were calling a burger. I had the BBQ veggie burger, which came with the quinoa onion rings on top. While flavourful, the patty was dry and reminded me of turkey stuffing. It was a big burger but pressing it down actually made the patty fall apart as well. The sweet potato fries that everyone raves about were adequate at best. Nice atmosphere and I was assured that their rice bowls are delicious. Just don't go here expecting to be converted."}
{"text":"We live two minutes away from Fresh so we go there way too often, whenever we are too lazy to cook. They already made a fortune with us.  Everything on the menu is vegetarian, most of it actually vegan and that's great!  They have a huge menu and there's something for everybody, whenever we go there with our (omnivore) family or guests they are very pleasantly suprised by how tasty vegan food can be. :) Definitely a good way to make vegan food more popular!  The only thing I dislike about fresh is that some menu items are not consistently good. Some of the wraps and especially the Ace of Kales. Sometimes it's amazing and other days it's a soggy watery salad you don't feel like finishing. Also, stop grating the Jicama, it was perfect the way it was! We sometimes need to take a break from Fresh because if you go there too often it gets old because everything kind of tastes the same, not sure why.   We get takeout 99% of the time because you get 15% off with the live green card. Order on the phone before going, wait is long else, they are always busy! Staff is horrid btw at spelling names, they get it wrong most of the time and I have a pretty common name.  Maybe create an app like b.good to facilitate ordering and paying and to reward frequent customers."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for vegans.  Great menu and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Top notch choice for healthy vegan food that still satisfies cravings for sweet and fried flavors. I enjoyed everything I tried after ducking into this small Queen Street joint on a rainy evening.   The quinoa onion rings deserve their city-wide fame, as they are large, piping hot and equipped with extra tantalizing texture thanks to the quinoa crust. The October special matcha shake with coconut milk and coconut whipped cream featured a strong matcha flavor tempered by the sweetness of the coconut. The dosas were a far cry in size and texture from what you'll find in a south Indian restaurant, but I enjoyed Fresh's take as the chickpea \"curry\" is quite flavorful if mild and melds well with the soft consistency \"dosa.\"     Wish the music/noise level were a bit lower, as I was engaged in lengthy conversation with a colleague. Also would have liked more pieces of fried squash blossom in my tacos, which contained a bit too much kale and lettuce, but they were still good. Everything tasted unique and delicious to me, so I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have to give this place extra stars for attracting as many girls as it does. Both inside as well as the patio were full and I think I was one of 3 or 4 guys who were at Fresh. With a great location beside Trinity Bellwoods Park, I might be back but definitely not for any of the food. I don't have a problem with vegan or vegetarian food but I cannot seem to like any of their wraps or drinks (the only things I've tried so far).  One warning however, be very careful when ordering the \"Lung Lover\" Immune Elixir. I have no idea what it was (I feel as if it was the ginger in the drink) but my throat would burn like I was taking shots of Vodka everytime I took a sip.  Service was quick and friendly though so I can't complain."}
{"text":"A wonderful neighborhood place for lunch or even dinner. I am not a vegetarian but I am hooked on the salads and rise bowls.  Everything is fresh and features interesting, sophisticated  flavors. Try the California Classic Salad with the house dressing and Ninja  rice bowl. Both are fabulous. Service is excellent , friendly and caring .  I have been lunching at this place for years and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"When I tried Fresh for the first time a few years ago, I was iffy on whether I liked it here or not. However, I had it this past weekend and it definitely changed my opinion on the veggie and vegan delicacy.  Maybe my tastes have changed when it comes to my palette but I had brunch there just a few days ago and it was delicious!  I started out with their smoothie called \"The Last Kiss\", which was a mixture of fresh banana, strawberry and pinapple. My friends also ordered their specialty drinks, where were incredible. I tried a sip of my friend's, which was the date and almond smoothie and it was to die for. I then tried my friend's carrot and orange juice and I could literally feel the healthy vitamins in the taste.  I decided to play it safe and order the banana pancakes, which were amazing! They were made with whole wheat or buckwheat dough and the bananas were baked right in.  So far, I can defintely say Fresh is amazing for a healthy brunch option. My next step to go back there for a lunch and a dinner!"}
{"text":"The Good: Everything is vegetarian, or vegan, and many items can be gluten free. The patio is very nice. The presentation.  Your dish looks like a little garden party.  The Bad: Service.  Fresh is in complete commune with nature.  They just let the wind blow your server over to you on its own accord.  If you order a salad, they will grow it for you.  If you go for lunch, order dinner. Food is assembled, not prepared.  A bowl is rice, with sauce on top, with raw beg on top of that, with nuts on top of that.  They may as well give you all of these things on separate plates.  There is absolutely no integration of flavours.    The Ugly: The price is outrageous.  A bowl of rice, and salad will run you $13.  If this were any other restaurant you would be able to get a burger, or half chicken plus rice and salad for $13.  Here, you get the sides, no main.  Worse, if you get a burger (falafel on a bun), you don't get any sides.  In short, if you are a vegetarian go to any greek joint, order a souvlaki, hold the pork.  You will get more, pay less."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. And the food came super fast. Had the falafel tacos and the dragon fries. No regrets."}
{"text":"My friend and I were walking down Queen St W and suddenly decided to stop somewhere for a bite. It didn't occur to me Fresh was a vegetarian restaurant until we were at the patio looking at the menu. My friend is a classic meat eater so I was a little concerned he wouldn't like the place, but our meal turned out to be outstanding. We had the soup & Salad combo but I'm sure you can order  anything from their menu and have a great meal. The service is indeed a bit slow but very attentive and friendly. I suppose it's because everything is fresh and made to order except for the cold press juices that are made off-site each morning. Spotted George Strombolopolous at a table near us if you care for celebrities sightings. Definitely going back. For Indian food lovers they serve Dosas which are hard to find outside the traditional Indian food circuit."}
{"text":"Bathrooms are a little better, I guess.  A coat of paint and a new counter top have cleaned up the appearance.  Signs indicate Renovations are happening.  How long have those signs been up though?"}
{"text":"From what I'm told, Fresh is a semi-local vegetarian chain. That's something I can get behind.   For veggie food I would say the price is mid-rangy, but there's a huge menu to choose from, their food combinations are fantastic, and their portions are substantial.   After agonizing over what to get, I settled on some onion rings with quinoa coating that were perfect. Then I went for a miso burger, which was also delicious. The grain patty was really satisfying and the toppings were true to the name - fresh. I do wish the burger came with more of the kale slaw on the side - that was really good. I also really enjoyed the hot sauce, so definitely ask for it if you're so inclined.  My dining partner got a dragon bowl on brown rice, which also looked delicious - and big.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"When you are in Toronto and you feel like eating healthy, you come to Fresh! Fresh is kind of like a mini chain of healthy vegan restearunts  with a few locations around the city. This was my first time coming to the Queen Street location and I was not let down! When we arrived for lunch it was very busy on the patio so we decided to just take a seat inside. The staff was friendly but also very busy so a bit of a wait was to be expected when ordering. I ended up ordering a Buffalo Wrap with some fries on the side and neither of the 2 let be down. The Buffalo wrap was absolutely  delciious  (Although I would of enjoyed a little bit less of the lettuce) and massive in size and the french fries were A+ in taste and saltines. Some people might find $12 a little expensive for just a wrap with no side but it does fill you up and it does taste really good. Overall, Fresh is always on my list when it comes to eating right, definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised that this location has a lower rating than the one on Spadina.  Whenever I'm at the other location, I always feel rushed and pushed to get out.  This location has a lot more tables and their outside patio is huge (and right up against the park), so it's a nice relaxing place to eat.  Again, their burgers are fantastic.  I love getting the mushroom burger with fries and a dip.  I think the sweet potato fries are better than the normal fries.    I want to eventually branch out and try something different ... but their burger gets me every time, what can I say?  Only thing I don't like: hated the fresh squeezed lemonade I got.  Was pure lemon juice.  I like tart things, but I had to keep adding water to make it drinkable.  It had very little water or sugar in it.  Would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Great food, wrong attitude. I love the food and this is the place to go for great juice options. The staff on the other hand is hideous! They have a snob attitude. One of them actually gave the look, like they are to busy to be nice."}
{"text":"My friend raved about Fresh and dragged me there for dinner. I thought the food was great...I forget the exact dish, but it included a generous amount of soup, salad and toasted cornbread. The salad was really fresh..I've never had something like that before and the soup and cornbread had great flavors. My friends had the coconut cake and the chocolate cake which they loved, but I thought was passable.  the servers did not give us attitude but were clearly in a hurry for us to leave. 4.5 stars, but yelp does not allow half points!"}
{"text":"It is really 3.5 star.   I like the burger here.  It is huge and the bun is surprisingly filling.  The patty is good for a vegetarian patty.  I even like the soup here.  Nothing tastes bland.  As far as vegetarian food goes, it is wonderful here.    I understand that they make all the things in house everyday, from scratch. This is why I like its burger but cannot agree with the price tag of the salad or the soup.  It is a salad; there isn't much cooking/manufacturing involved.  And homemade soup at other restaurants are not as pricey."}
{"text":"I love that Fresh has so many vegan options! I've been going to all their locations for years favouring the bowls and salads but they've really stepped things up the past few years with their quinoa onion rings (!!!!) and their latest offerings of tacos.  I love that you can order sides of so many things on their menu and can literally make a meal of just sides or ramp up your entree with extras.   Note: Location is barrier-free with accessible unisex washroom on same floor with grab bar BUT it is a very crowded space which would make it extremely difficult for a wheelchair user and they do not take reservations. Tables are tight even for people who do not use an aid."}
{"text":"Let me just say that I hate giving a vegan restaurant only 3 stars because I LOVE being able to pick anything I like from the menu without worrying that it'll have animal products. The menu itself looks great, lot's of different options for everyone!  My friend ordered a Black Bean burrito ($12) and I ordered Grilled Tofu tacos ($10 for 2 tacos). Our waitress was fast and very personable, I really liked her!  Looks like the other restaurant staff were similarly awesome. The food came pretty fast, only 10min wait, both dishes looked and smelled great.  Except it was all tasteless.. even with the generous amount of jalapeño/lime taco sauce on my tacos, they were so bland!  I asked for hot sauce, it was \"house hot sauce\", there was absolutely no spice in it, tasted more like a thick salad dressing.   My friend felt the same about her Black Bean Burrito, it was beautiful to look at but had no flavour at all. I took a bite from her burrito and yep, so blaaaaand!  Ahhhh VEGAN food should never taste this boring (I've been a dedicated herbivore for 9 years).  PLEASE add more flavour"}
{"text":"I used to come here almost every day for lunch while I was working in the area. Never disappointed.   The quinoa onion rings were always perfectly fried. Both the squash tacos and the grilled tofu tacos come with a divine jalapeño/lime sauce. The BBQ burger (made from almond and grain) is filling and flavorful.   The tiger bowl is one of their premium rice bowls (you also have the option of soba noodles) and it is topped with crispy tofu cubes and a sweet and savory housemade 3*6*9 dressing. This was a  regular lunch order of many of my coworkers (all non-vegan) which is why I gave it a go. That dressing has an addictive quality. And we always found ourselves adding extra crispy tofu cubes to our order...I highly recommend it!   I have not tried any of their highly praised fruit smoothies or green juices, regrettably. But I did get the chance to try one of their cold pressed juices...the charcoal green lemonade. Don't let the intense color from the activated charcoal intimidate you like I almost did! It's refreshing and delicious! You don't taste the charcoal."}
{"text":"The food was fine... not great, kind of bland. Just regular chopped salad w rice... kind of overpriced to be honest. I paid 15 $ for some chopped cucumber and tofu over plain rice. TABLE SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE. I WAITED OVER AN HOUR TO GET MY VERY SIMPLE FOOD. Even the take-out was slow... I saw this old poor lady wait for an hour for the soup she ordered.   Never again."}
{"text":"Soooooo delicious! I forgot how amazing this place was. :) the cookies, the bowls and the appetizers...All amazing!  Oh and the smoothies...and an outside patio for the summer.!"}
{"text":"I'd give half a star for the inexistent service, and four for the food. I tried a salad, because I wanted something that wouldn't make me feel so full, and what they don't tell you is that the salad is served with lots of grains (couscous?). I LIKE salad with grains, but it's a different concept from having, you know, \"something quick and light\".    Also, they don't seem to know what the word \"quick\" means, as I waited almost an hour for the salad thing and a wrap. Terrible service. I'm not willing to come back."}
{"text":"Returned to Fresh on Queen for the first time in nearly two years for an early birthday dinner last night, and it remains my favorite food establishment this side of the Atlantic.  In those nearly two years, I've also visited Fresh on Spadina and Fresh on Bloor, and can confirm that the Queen West restaurant offers by far the most pleasant dining experience.  The interior is even more minuscule than the location on Spadina, but the tables are arranged in such a way that you aren't constantly elbowing the people next to you.  This one also has a lovely patio on Crawford street - it was raining during my last visit, but I can envision myself having brunch and a laugh with my friends out there while people watching.  Brunch Aspirations, my friends.  The dishes here are not fancy or complicated but manage to taste upscale.  I recently received a Fresh cookbook as a gift, and insight as to how simple and clean each recipe is has given me a greater appreciation for the thought that goes into the menu here.  You'll leave here satisfied, feeling good about what you're giving your body.  After several visits, my favorites are the squash tacos, the green poutine on sweet potato fries, and the powerhouse bowl on soba noodles.  I hope to come back in the winter to warm up with the soup, salad and cornbread combo.  I have never found the service anything but friendly, and even with a full house and a takeout line out the door, my meal last night was in front of me in a hot second.  This is and forever will be my favorite restaurant, world without end, amen."}
{"text":"This place used to be my go to but I've realized that though they use wholesome ingredients, the food is actually pretty high in calories and many items are deep fried.  Their policy with juices is also ridiculous. If you buy a large juice you have to buy their glass bottle. It's not a deposit. It's your bottle and you have the option to bring it back for a discount on future purchases. Well if you do, don't forget the cheap plastic lid, otherwise they will charge you again. Once I picked up the wrong bottle on my way which was the exact same size and design, just from another shop and they didn't honor the discount. So they are really just peddling these stupid bottles and not taking them back either. Not very sustainable.  It's a popular place so a few times I have gotten attitude from the host/hostess when waiting for a seat. They were also not very accommodating when my friend and I came with strollers after 3 in the afternoon and the place was empty. They acted like it was such an inconvenience to seat us at one of the many empty tables. We left and haven't been back since. Luckily there are lots of cool places that are better popping up all over queen."}
{"text":"I don't really understand the appeal of Fresh. I think that it is simplistic to assume that vegetarian/vegan food is healthy food and there is a lot of health-washing happening here.  Quinoa onion rings, anyone?  Outside of my distaste for the concept of this restaurant, the food is ok and the prices are fair. It also took an hour to get a table on a Wednesday night. That is insane!"}
{"text":"I'm vending here at Trinity Bellwoods. For the Art Crawl 2016. I gave my boyfriend 10 bucks to get coffee. We choose to go to Fresh because they serve Harmony milk.  He comes back with two 8oz, double americanos and $2.40 in change. This is obscene!   Never in my life have I gotten an 8 Oz DOUBLE AMERICANO for $3.80 Each! First off, on a day such as this; cold, damp, penetrative chill... I need something that is going to keep me warm longer and not get cold so quickly! Usually when I go to the Common, who also serves Harmony milk I can get a 12 Oz double americano for 3 bucks. That is way more reasonable.   There coffee at Fresh must be so damn weak too... DOUBLE AMERICANO IN AN 8 OZ  cup... unheard of!    ON TOP OF THIS... YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR HONEY! WOW!   I asked a couple ppl walking by where they got their coffee. They told me Mabels... \"how much?\",  I asked. They said $4 for the two of them. They were 2 12 oz coffees. They told me it's a couple blocks West of here.... hmmm I shall go there next time as I am so livid right now with Fresh. I usually like them for their salads and juices but coffee? No, uh uh.   Lesson learned... don't go to Fresh on Crawford and Queen or ANY OF THEIR LOCATIONS for coffee.  They are lucky they are getting one star even!"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and I can't think of a meal I didn't love. I see some comments about wait staff hipster attitude but I guess I've been pretty lucky because they've always treated me well!  My favorite menu option is the choice of bowls with soba noodles - keeps me coming back for more!    The desserts are worth an afternoon carb coma - but on on the pricey side, which bring me to the only criticism I have: high prices, which seem to increase all the time  (but portions do not). I suspect with all the vegetarian competition out there these days, Fresh may need to take note and offer more reasonable options. I hope so, because the siren song of Utopia Cafe is calling my name..."}
{"text":"Premise:  As per name of restaurant, everything IS fresh, clean eats, & most, if not all menu items are vegan.  If not, it is indicated on menu by a special symbol.  Some items are cooked, so it's not raw.  Came here to celebrate a friend's bday.  This was her choice, but I was not opposed to it.  Restaurant itself is SMALL.  Only 1 table that accommodates 6ppl.  Had to wait quite some time for it to open up AND we were charged an 18% grat.  :(  A couple of my only gripes.  Another one was the pricing of their drinks.  For example, a freshly pressed pink grapefruit juice was like $8 for a small bottle.  Other juices were ~$10.  A 2L carton of grapefruit juice, non-concentrated, would cost what...maybe $4??  And that'll last a coupla weeks.  So I basically looked over the drink portion of the menu.  However, you can sample whatever you want and I took full advantage of that!  ;)  Aside from the drinks, most food items were decently priced.  I have to agree that some of the salads seem pricey - after all, it's just mixed greens and some house made dressing, but it's essentially just veg.  I must say though, that the portions themselves are HUGE.  So maybe if you share, it'll seem like it's better value?  I had the Jerusalem bowl with soba noodles (baby size - $10 + $1.50 for the noodles).  The baby portion was just right for me!  And even though it stated that there was chilli powder, it was not spicy.  Again, wait for larger table + mandatory grat for \"large groups\", even after a long wait + drink prices were my only criticisms.  Otherwise, all good and fresh, will be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has everything you need for friends and family with dietary restrictions. The menu is clearly labeled and there are great options, not just one or two dishes for folks with allergies, sensitivities, etc. The staff is friendly and the service is good, even when it's crowded and it's usually crowded. The patio is the best part in summer and that's saying something."}
{"text":"Solid three. The bowls used to be my favourite but the rice to topping ratio has swung too much in favour of the rice. The bowls are no longer worth their price. I recommend to stick to the salads and other dishes."}
{"text":"I mean vegetarian food are usually a bit more expensive and the tiger bowl from this place is delicious. Staff and employees are all fairly friendly. Definitely a go to place for vegetarians"}
{"text":"Love this place. My GF and I go here a lot on the weekends. We both enjoy their salads, and energy shakes. We recommend getting the Almond Java Shake and the Tangey Thai Salad...great way to start your Sunday morning ;) Happy Eating"}
{"text":"Fresh used to be awesome. Now it's even more over priced then before and thequality has gone down :(  What a shame.  My husband and I had received a $70 gift card and were excited to go and figured that the gift card would cover it. Ha. 2 glasses of wine, an appetizer, a burger and a salad and the gift card was beyond gone! That's crazy and unreasonable!!!!!! And I haven't even touched on the service. All I'm gonna say is, hipsters shouldn't wait tables. My order was messed up twice.  Forget it Fresh. Me and you - we're through!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, fabulous service and fresh food. What more can you ask for? Definitely try an immunity shot if you feel like you're getting sick or if you are sick, a green juice or smoothie is a must, and bowls/salads are definitely a go-to!"}
{"text":"I've read the recent reviews and I was a bit worried to see comments about slow service, bad service, or lack of flavour.  I thankfully didnt see any of those issues creep here.  I saw all of those when I went to the Bloor St location but I would say of the 3 Freshs I've been to (Bloor, Spadinda, and Crawford), this one was the better experience.  Arriving on a Sunday brunch, we were able to book online a reservation and so we had no issues getting a table quickly.  I think it's not well known that they're on OpenTable for reservation.  It's super easy to book a spot that way.  With only 30 minutes after opening, the patio was nearly taken.  I think we took one of the last 2 tables.  The inside though... was bare!  Maybe only 3 tables were taken.  With the patio, it nearly doubles their capacity.  So if you see a line up out the door or crowding the front, take a peak... it might be people waiting for the patio in the summer.  You can score a table with zero wait inside. As for the seating, it's not so crowded on the patio.  Definitely busy and definitely full but there's enough space that you dont have to move tables to get out (like in Bloor).  As for the space itself, it's clean and open with a lot of shade.  You can be at the edge where it meets the sidewalk and you will have lots of sun.  That morning, they were still using the heater and I sat underneath it.  I was kept cozy as it was late spring.    Service here was 3 times faster than the other 2 spots (Bloor and Spadina).  Though there was about 3 staff managing the patio, they kept the food coming in and out as they were trying to bring more and more of the line into the patio.  I dont think we waited terribly long for anything.  We might have waited a bit to order but it was no where as bad as the other 2 spots.  Maybe a little more than 10 minutes.  After our order, the app came in quickly with our salads and bowls shortly after.  I think your experience will heavily depend on how good your servers are... cause we got some terrible ones at Bloor but here, they're faster and more aware.  Buffalo Cauliflower - This has to be my favourite app on the menu... I keep ordering it and there hasnt been a bad plate yet.  Tender cauliflower is battered then fried up crisp and dressed with a tangy hot sauce.  They always arrive hot and crispy.  Some people love the onion rings or the sweet potato fries... I always go for the cauliflower!  4/5  Ultimate Falafel Salad - I tried this this a while ago and though I love all the vegetables they put into this, the falafels themselves were just ok.  They werent really crispy or hot... just kinda warm and a bit mushy.  They generously piled on the crispy onions, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, mint parsley, and cranberries on the salad base.  A nice drizzle of the tahini sauce just made things perk up in flavour.  Maybe I'll try a new salad next time but this still is one of the better ones I've tried.  3.5/5  Tangled Thai - This was a nice colour salad with the spirals of carrots and beets.  They had also the purple cabbage, cucumbers, red peppers and tons of peanuts on top.  We did ask for few extra add ons and they gave a super generous amount.  Unlike some places where they only give you 1 tbsp... they pile it on.  So never feel like the extras are a waste of money.   The peanut citrus sauce was a good way to add more nutty flavour to the salad.  4/5  I think Fresh can be hit and miss but this particular Sunday, they were much better than usual.  I think if you arrive before the crazy rushes you'll have a better experience.  Sunday brunch seems like a good time to hit the patio if you want."}
{"text":"Fresh - you vegan anomaly in my carnivorous life. I am an emphatic hater of tofu and its associated products, so it is a surprise that I frequent Fresh as much as I do. Fresh has excellent salads, the 'eat your greens' is lovely with edamame, cucumber, pea shoots and ginger dressing. The soup and cornbread combo is always a welcome addition to my midday life. Their soups are usually vegetable purees and the cornbread - although dry and crumbly, is tasty with its accompanying hummus (or vegan butter - if you're into that kind of thing - which I am emphatically not). The onion rings are battered with flour and quinoa and remain forever crispy and onion-y good.   Lunch at Fresh rarely disappoints me - it's wholesome, tastes good and makes me feel healthy and new again."}
{"text":"Really delicious and so yummy. The hot sauce they serve is so unique and adds so much flavour to the food.   I'm so glad I found a healthy go-to spot near my house. I love love love that they make vegan food taste so good."}
{"text":"Not sure I can say much beyond what others have said. Fresh has several locations throughout the city and they offer a cornucopia of healthy vegetarian delights, including a full suite of smoothies and juices. The bowls in particular are outstanding and there are so many options to customize your meal depending on restrictions or preference.  It's often quite busy during peak times but the service has always been good. The tables can be a bit small and volume and table turnover is high, but it still manages to have a reasonably chill vibe (no doubt an ambiance requirement when over 30% of your servers have dreadlocks). Re: price point, you're paying a bit more for the quality of the food, but you won't leave hungry! Have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"I'm not vegan however Fresh is amazing and I love it. Their options are very interesting and so different. The menu includes freshly made juices and smoothies on one side, then on the other are the food options. There's small dishes, tacos, wraps, salads and bowls. I've come here a couple times and both times I was very pleased. This time I ordered the \"holiday wrap\" which had a ton of veggies and some sort of white sauce that I loved. Also the French fries here are a must.  I highly recommend this place, it's always so good."}
{"text":"So for breakfast/brunch Id give this place a 4 but all other times a 3.  Its always crowded and buzzing which can get frustrating but the menu has LOTS of options and you always feel better eating here.  The onion rings - YUM!  The dosa is very non traditional so if that's what you are looking for, Id skip this one.    The tempeh bacon in the brunch menu is really good.  Honestly, just call it tempeh, it really doesn't need to be \"baconized\" to be delicious."}
{"text":"The truth is, I'm slightly obsessed with Fresh. A recent visit to Toronto had me stopping in at three different locations but the one on Queen remains my favorite. Five check-ins & the truth.  Though I tend to go for the hearty, warming bowls in the chillier months, my most recent visit had me admiring that salad menu and I felt I *needed* that Superfood salad. I swear, it felt like I was giving my body the perfect medicine. It's bursting with vitality-- so many green crunchy things. This salad will make you glow.  I also recommend ordering the bread, olives & dukkah to go with."}
{"text":"Excellent healthy tasty food. Great atmosphere and good service (the waitresses there were very friendly and cute). Fresh, healthy ingredients and I could taste the various herbs and seasonings that went into the dishes. I started with a bowl of the sweet potato fries with an excellent garlic mayo dip on the side.  The mayo dip is luckily not all mayo, it is made with tofu and miso which gave it a nice texture and flavor while being healthier and not greasy. I had the Energy bowl, which the portion was huge (regular size) and very tasty.  I had to take half of it home. Next time I will order a baby bowl size with an appetizer, or at least order it with rice instead of soba noodles as the noodles does not reheat well (turns to mush).  There were many tables that ordered the onion rings which looked amazing.  Nice to know that they serve breakfast til 3pm on weekends.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My first vegan restaurant experience. I ordered the poutine fries dressed in vegan cheese/greens/etc and the chipotle burger. I am very satisfied with the food, among the other aspects of this business."}
{"text":"My patience with Fresh has waned in recent months and I've seen my previous five star rating slip to something like a three or four, especially now that Toronto has so many other veg-friendly options at a much better price.   While the food is incredibly tasty and there are some unique flavour combinations, there is just no way a wrap and small juice should cost $21. JUST a wrap, no fries or side of any sort. It just seems completely ludicrous and unnecessary.  Also, I care about the environment as much as the next guy, but I think quality should override concern for biodegradability when it comes to takeaway containers. The new recycled cornmeal (or whatever it is) containers that Fresh has started using for takeaway can't even hold up to the wimpiest of meals. They buckle at the mere weight of the average sandwich, the snaps don't close properly, and you can forget about transporting a hot soup or chili with any semblance of safety or preservation - the lid flies right off and the wimpy material biodegrades as you attempt to eat the food that's inside it. My suggestion would be to just bring in your own container altogether and save 10%."}
{"text":"Most amazing experience ever!  I'm a big fan of this location because not only the food excels but the staff is the most friendlies ever!  It's reFRESHing! !"}
{"text":"Surprisingly very filling and delicious salads. The portions, toppings, and the dressings really wowed me. The salads are usually ~$15.50 and I've tried the All-Star & my friend tried the Monster Protein and we both LOVED it.   All-Star (5/5): Love the thick slices of sweet potato & tofu. There were sweet and chewy goji berries, quinoa under microgreens, cucumbers, and HUGE heirloom tomatoes. I also got to choose 2 dressings for no extra cost. I choose the 3*6*9 and Tahini (both had tahini but I liked the tahini creaminess and garlic better than the sweetness of 3*6*9).    We were so satisfied after the salad and I'm super excited to try more. So fresh, flavourful, and filling!!"}
{"text":"after eating here for the first time, i made the effort to make it my last meal on my way out of toronto and i'm so glad i did. everything is vegan. with a dairy allergy, this is bliss because i can eat anything on the menu, which is vast.   the first day i had a perfectly seasoned tomato soup and dosas (i have been denied dosas before due to the dairy). the second visit, i had vegetable spring rolls with a wonderful, thick peanut sauce. i was in a bit of a rush so my server packed up the remainder of one of my spring rolls and the peanut sauce. i ordered an energizer smoothie to go and drank it on my walk back to the hotel and on my way to the airport.   as i was sitting at the gate, waiting to board my plane, i was SO grateful my server offered to pack up what i couldn't finish, for me to eat at the airport. it was perfectly packed, didn't leak in my purse, and was exactly what i needed before a long flight.  cheers! i'm a fan!"}
{"text":"This place is everything!! I've never had such delicious and fresh bowls before and I've been traveling around to a lot of up and coming bowl restaurants throughout North American. I got the matcha latte hot to start after braving the cold then I got the new macro bowl & my boyfriend got the powerhouse. Both were out of this world. The macro came with 2 sauces to which I would highly suggest the powerhouse dressing and the mushroom gravy - unbelievable! I cannot say enough good things about this spot and food. I would love to replicate these at home and eat them everyday. Our waitress was super awesome too! Would love to come back to visit when coming through Toronto."}
{"text":"I don't know who I was trying to kid not giving this place 5 stars. I frequent all of the Fresh locations often, and this one is by far my favourite, and if you're on this patio as often as I am in the nice weather, not giving it five fabulous stars just seems rude.   New favourites include: Jerusalem Bowl, with rice add falafel no red onions, and their vegan poutine. I'm also now keen to add a side of steamed broccoli for $3, because, well, health for $3! Why the hell not?"}
{"text":"the name says it all....FRESH. I find that every time I'm looking to have that nice fresh healthy delicious meal, Fresh is what always pops into my mind. I love the food on this menu and the prices are very decent for the quality of food that they serve.  The atmosphere is very nice and during the summer they have one of the better patios around. (always packed, but worth the wait)"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to find several not so good reviews on this place.  I think it comes from spoiled people who do not live in the middle of nowhere and who's only true choice for vegetarian is their own cafe, opened out of desperation. We got to this Fresh location after walking from our hotel (trust me, it was a very long walk).  I was starved and getting cranky and when I saw how crowded this place was I was a bit upset that I might have to wait.  There was some seating outside but it was too cold for my taste and there was the juice bar where we ended up sitting.  I thought it would take them forever to serve us but it was not so.  The whole time we were there they were incredibly busy and yet service was FAST. We ordered soups with corn bread (amazing) a dosa (yum!) and then I had the BBQ Veggie burger which was so incredibly large I had to deconstruct it and eat with a fork and knife.  The onion rings that came with it were not to be believed and I know I will dream of them for a long time to come.  The bun was good, the veggie burger itself was awesome. I wonder if they are thinking of opening any locations in NH...  I'd love to open one!"}
{"text":"We ordered the chipotle bacon burger and the crispy cauliflower tacos. The burger was pretty good - I would recommend adding ketchup on the burger so it's not too dry. There were two tacos for each order and the tacos were on the bigger side, which three crispy cauliflower in each. They tasted delicious! We also got a side of dragon fries and they were incredible! The sauce was really good and the banana peppers added a little kick to the flavour. The service was amazing, which definitely made the experience better. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Always feel so good after a feast at this place! Service is always super friendly and really good! Happy the patio is open again!"}
