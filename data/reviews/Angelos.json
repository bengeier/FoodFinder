{"text":"Have previously had good meals here. Ben is a fine server (on my previous visit).  Friday seems to have a very abbreviated menu to the point I nearly left to find a more varied menu.. All pasta and pizza and fish...owing to it being Friday.  No non pasta entrees. Ordered wine to be brought a small carafe and told I could drink out of that because no wine glasses were clean. On the plus side the server gal did bring a clean wine glass out eventually when I made a big enough stink. No broiled fish but one entry that was baked...guess that will have to do. Clearly what I have learned is not to come here on Friday night as the abbreviated menu makes it not worth coming....maybe another njght? Well...One more try before I write this place off.  .....ok i just got done with the Baked Cod and it was quite tasty.  Just disappointed  that the menu was not what I was expecting. ..I was little harsh in the above paragraphs. ..food was good. Vote up from two to three stars...."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed!  Love this place!  A couple service things they will improve on over time but all in all a good place to catch dinner.  Brooklyn needed a place like this.  I would like it more if they supplied hard alcohol."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza a few weeks after they opened.  Really expensive for what you get, which reminded us of Pizza Hut, and that isn't a good thing.  Haven't gone back, we live in Brooklyn so we travel to Oregon which has a few better pizza options that are less expensive and more authentic."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and pasta, plus great Friday Fish Fry..all in little Brooklyn. Try the White Pizza, so good I swear they have the best alfredo sauce I've ever had. The spinach and artichoke dip is to die for. Portions are average but you will never leave hungry at Angelo's. Service is good, keep in mind this is not fast food so be patient and enjoy a nice dinner."}
