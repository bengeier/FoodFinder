{"text":"I visited this theater for a performance by Soulpepper theater company. While each performance is unique so I am going to rate this theater based upon the things matter to a performance area. I watched a performance that was 60 min long at Michael Young Theater which apparently is the smaller of the two theaters. I found the the view was unobstructed for all the seats with a good view of the stage even from the last row of seats. The lighting and mix media were used well in the performance I saw as otherwise the stage was spartan for this particular play. The seats were unfortunately not comfortable. The main lobby area is nice and inviting and plenty of drinks/food items available for consumption. One is even allowed to bring in drinks into the theater which is becoming rare and rare.  Bonus points for the extremely clean washroom. Getting here depends on your mode of transport if you Uber/Drive here getting here is ez. Public transport even with the new street car isn't very frequent and it is a good 10-15 min ride from King station.  3.5 star."}
{"text":"The Young Centre is one of my favourite places to see theatre in the city. I've had lots of memorable experiences here. On the Eastern end of the Distillery District, it's close to lots of good dining and shopping options and you can make a day of it. The Young Centre is home to Soulpepper Theatre, George Brown Theatre School, Global Cabaret Festival, and the occasional dance event. There are 3 theatres ranging from small and intimate (The Tank House, where I saw \"Paper Series\" by Cahoots Theatre Company), inbetween (Michael Young Theatre, where you can catch \"Kim's Convenience\" on now!), and grand (Marilyn and Charles Baillie Theatre, where they show the biggest productions like \"A Christmas Carol\", \"Parfumerie\", \"Our Town\", etc.). Even in the largest theatre, there are almost no 'bad' seats in the house (with the exception of the 2nd level, anything really far on the side, where you sit on chairs instead of regular seats).   I really like the warm and unpretentious vibe of the space. Lots of long, wooden communal tables, exposed brick, and a cozy fireplace in the lobby make intermissions more fun. The box office and ticket pick-up desk are always running efficiently. The little cafe in the lobby is surprisingly good too. I once ate a meal there because I didn't have time to go to a restaurant. They have a small selection of toasted paninis, crepes, and salads in addition to the cookies and muffins. In terms of drinks, they make a good latte and have a decent wine selection + beers. Overall, the variety is so much better than concessions stands at other theatres like the Sony Centre, Four Seasons, Factory Theatre, etc.! It's nice to be able to find something other than candies and overpriced mini Haagen-Dazs. Finally, washrooms are clean and big, and there is almost never a line!   Great performers deserve an equally great performance venue and this is it!"}
{"text":"Nice space, TERRIBLE service and a complete lack of organization. They have this bafflingly idiotic set up at the bar where there are multiple servers but only one line - and there is NO signage or number system to indicate that. The girl behind the bar last night saw me waiting patiently while she served the two people in front of me - this was 2 minutes before we had to be in our seats - then when I got to the counter and said \"Hi\", she cut me off with \"The line's over there.\" Ummmmmmm.... excuse me?!?!? You're telling me that NOW??? So with 30 seconds to go before the show starts, I go to the back of the line, which is now several people longer. As I did so, the guy in front of me said \"Ridiculous, right??!\" because the same thing had just happened to him. Of course, by the time I actually got served, and then rushed over to the doors, they play had just started. They literally closed the doors on us AS we got there. So we had to wait outside for ten minutes before they would take us in.   Even then they wanted to take us to these uncomfortable stools at the back, and weren't going to let us go to the actual seats that we paid a stupid amount of money for. However, there was a guy next to us who was even madder - he had actually arrived early, then been told he had to go somewhere else to pick up his tickets. They told him he plenty of time - and lo and behold, he got back and they shut the door on him. He kicked up a fuss so they took us to our actual seats instead of the stools at the back, but seriously. What terrible, terrible organization. Not a well run ship at all.   Not to mention - $10.50 for the teensiest, tiniest glass of wine I have ever seen in my life! It must have been about 2 ounces. Unbelievable. There are much, MUCH better places to catch a show in the city, without the rip-off prices and the attitude. Avoid it!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's actually a very eat place nestled in the heart of distillery district, it's very artsy and yet urban. One of the places that allows you to bring drinks (in closed lids cups) and offer decent food in the cafeteria. It is VERY clean. The washroom will not spoil your theatre experience.   The communal tables create a sense of artsy-urban community space and perhaps a new pick up place for theatre aficionados. I'm kidding. High ceiling welcomes patrons and makes the wait in the lobby easier to bear. Ticket \"booth\" is small but I didn't see any line up when I was there because the theatre's seating capacity is small."}
