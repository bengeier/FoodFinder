{"text":"Food was tasty and fresh. However I was taken aback by the fact that they do not accommodate to families. What restaurant does not have a hi chair or booster seat in this day and age. We dine out frequently at both upscale and family style restaurants and I never was told that they don't have a hi chair booster seat. That being said, it's unfortunate for the restaurant that they did not retain this customer as I will not be returning there. I hope this review helps those who have young children."}
{"text":"The restaurant said they are wheelchair accessible, absolutely NOT. The entrance has two steep steps and then you're faced with a set of double doors. After my husband carried me and the wheelchair up the steps, no one helped with the doors. The valet sat on his chair and stared into space. I'm not a dotting old pensioner and thankfully my husband is strong and capable."}
{"text":"Expensive for what you actually get. Fish was also overcooked, which is sad for a restaurant that specializes in fish..."}
{"text":"This was my favorite Greek restaurant for the past 10 years, however a recent experience has changed my mind. The food is still excellent as always (hence the 2 stars), and perhaps I'll continue to pick up from them, but I won't be going back in as the wait staff & service has deteriorated this last year. We had an 8:15 reservation on a Friday night in the summer in Montreal. At 9:45pm, the valet guy handed me my keys and they turned the music off and turned the lights on bright & began to close and try to kick us out. We were appalled, given we've been giving them our business for years. If you want to close at 9:45, then tell people that your last reservation is a 7:15, because people want to enjoy a nice expensive meal over 2-2.5 hours... Don't give out 8 pm reservations. Also, the wait staff used to accommodate every request, but in the last year they got a couple of new waiters who are extremely lazy, say no to everything and look downright like they could care less. In fact they had changed into street clothes & left at the same time we did. At 9:45pm on a Friday night in Montreal ??? This is unacceptable... Aren't we a city know for great night life & good RESTOS?"}
{"text":"Best lamb chops in Montreal! I would definitely recommend to start with the fried zucchini and eggplant. It's so thin and crispy that you can't stop eating them! And for the main course, I would highly recommend the lamb chops. They are by far the best in town!"}
{"text":"Went there for supper recently with friends and were taken up by the menu and the food servings. The Greek salad for one looked like it could feed a few people. The rest of the was excellent to the taste and budget. The baklava was freshly made and not too sweet nor was it flaky.  The service was excellent and the surroundings, cozy.   I would recommend this place for two or a small group."}
{"text":"I found the restaurant to have a very nice, clean, homey atmosphere. The service was good.  The most shocking part to me was the fish. I found the black bass and chilean sea bass to be very average. The meals came with lima beans and rice."}
{"text":"The quality of food is great!  The service is abysmal!!! We ordered 4 appetizers and two came at the beginning of the meal an two came after our entrees were done. The green salad came at the very end when our entrees were done. They even tried to serve a Greek salad when we ordered a green salad. No apologies just said we are very busy!! The restaurant was at 2/3 capacity the whole three hours we spent there!  I will never return no matter how good the food. We got the bill n no offerings of desserts or coffee and the side dishes that were suppose to come with our entrees ended up as take home as they never came with the meal!  No apologies at all from the waitstaff."}
{"text":"The best Greek restaurant I have ever been to, and I have been to many. The grilled octopus was delicious, crispy out and tender in.  Real Greek salad, no lettuce. The salad for one was enough for two... I can't imagine the salad for two! Chilean sea bass was prepared to perfection and so were the lamb chops with enough fat on them to make it a delicacy. Grilled vegetables exquisitely done!  Everything we ordered exceeded my expectations."}
