{"text":"Shout out to Adam, who was awesome and made us want to go back there every night. Though this lady got a yummy cider and a pulled pork sammy, there were only sides for the guy because they are seriously lacking in vegetarian options. Totally ok though because Adam was awesome and could tell that we worked in the industry."}
{"text":"A tiny and clever addition to the Leslieville neighbourhood (welcome!), and we're glad they're here.  Good things: - smoked beef brisket was tender and delicious - sweet bbq sauce was awesome - maple beans, super mapley and DELISH - spicy sausage was spicy and also delish.  - very friendly service  Not so good things: - dudes, WONDER BREAD along with the high-quality bbq? come on. you can do better.  - brisket was room temp. it would have been 100% more delicious if hot - mac and cheese was a disappointment...near tasteless and lukewarm  Our advice: warm up the mains, either pump up the mac+cheese with real cheese or kill it from the menu (or do what The Works does and just serve well-made Kraft Dinner and be proud of it), improve the quality of the bread and you will be unbeatable."}
{"text":"Dry ribs are truly amazing. Side of maple beans and bread add to this. Yum Negroni. Great little spot on the leslieville easterly end. Open window to the passers u and street. Great energy. Good lighting. Not too loud and good options for seating at bar, window or booth. Usually there is one kid in the mix,  but always for some reason, they seem super chill."}
{"text":"We came for dinner, arrived around 9pm on a Saturday night, and the place was almost empty. The staff were lovely, nice local beer selection, but I paid $26 for a steak and it tasted really 'off', the general consensus was that it tasted barn-y/like goat cheese. it was so so disappointing, especially at that price point, even among the 4 of us we left much of it uneaten...I feel nauseous just thinking about it. The Mac and Cheese was watery and flavourless. The baked beans were good but very heavy on the maple syrup. Coleslaw was fine... Onion rings were fine.... Ribs were probably the best of the dishes we had at a 4/5, chop sandwich was also pretty good, but overall we weren't impressed."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday night and it was pretty dead - just one other table and someone at the bar. We ordered assorted BBQ meats plus chicken & waffles, it wasnt great. Dry and  lukewarm. Probably been sitting there a while because the place was dead."}
{"text":"Definitely a server's bar. Service is always very quick and there's lot's of booths, so it's almost never an issue to get one. Great for craft beer and cheap tequila!"}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  This place has a great atmosphere with really friendly staff. The decor has a Texan rustic vibe, which I was totally digging. It is quite small with probably 20 seats total so not the best for a very large group.   They have a number of gluten-free items without the accompanying bread. I was told their homemade BBQ sauce is glutenfree, but it has bourbon in it (which many debate on whether it's gluten-free or not), so make your own judgment. I didn't react to anything I ate. I got the dry rub ribs and a side of fries, which were both delicious. They also had Brickworks and Pommies ciders in can available, which are two fantastic options. We ended the night with free tequila shots with our waitor, which was so deliciously smooth.  A few extras: They are open until 2am every night of the week and have daily specials. Shots are $3 every day all the time.   Seriously, don't sleep on this place. Great food, great people, great vibe."}
{"text":"Friendly, knowledgeable and quick service make this place welcoming, and the food lives up to the gorgeous rustic interior. We ordered the ribs and brisket with onion rings and slaw on the side. Brisket beautifully tender, ribs agreeably spicy if a touch on the dry side. Slaw was amazing - not overly saucy, crisp and crunchy. Good selection of drinks and great value. And our lovely server brought us tequila as an end to the meal! Excellent place, really recommended."}
{"text":"We tried this place for and we wish we hadn't.  The smell of a smoke house did not fill the air. Instead we were greeted with the stink of dirty dish rags.  We had 2 - 3  different meats from the menu. Each of them left a forgettable impression on us.  We had high hopes for this place...too bad..."}
{"text":"The brisket and fries were delicious. Got takeout from here and it was ready fast and reasonably priced. We also ordered the chicken and waffles which was decent but the brisket was definitely the standout."}
{"text":"This quaint little restaurant on the east side has some charm to it. It had a good vibe and I have no complaints about the service. The one part leaving me from really liking this place is the food.  We tried the: Pulled Pork Sandwich Chicken & Waffles Mac & Cheese Brussel Sprouts  Frankly, for a $10 sandwich with no side dish, the pulled pork was underwhelming in both flavour and size. The chicken and waffles had a sauce pre-applied to the chicken which was a bit weird but not terrible. The mac and cheese was pretty blah, but the brussel sprouts were actually really good.  So we went, we ate, and we didn't hate it, but I don't see us rushing back at any point.  Sounds like a 3 star experience as any."}
{"text":"A surprise gem. This place was really good. Ordered takeout. Had the brisket, fries and the chicken & waffles with a side of spicy slaw. All very tasty. Came with a few side sauces, including BBQ suace, gravy and some other mayo-based yellow sauce that was very good.  Place has a laid-back vibe with TV screens on the walls showing sports and round bar.   Servers and staff are super friendly.  We live in the area so its super convenient. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went here last night with a few friends, hoping their kitchen was still open so i could get some of their super delicious mac and cheese while my friends drank a few beers.. (i was pretty hungry)   Sadly, once we got their the kitchen was closed and I was joking around with the bartender saying \"oh nooo! i wanted mac and cheese\" any normal bartender would have been like sorry girl, it's 12AM why do you need mac and cheese?   THIS BARTENDER, LOOKED AT ME AND SAID HEY. YOU CAN HAVE THE REST OF MINE.   THIS WOMAN WAS A BLESSING, she also had a neighbouring business owner hand out free watermelon.. like.. I love this bar. GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Great staff, simple menu and child-friendly.  I had the chicken and waffles and they were great!  I ordered mac and cheese for my son and he liked it too.  It was a bit of a wait to get food despite it being not busy inside.  We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"First off I love this place. Texas themed So coooool! One negative side is the Mac and cheese is processed cheese. Couldn't eat it But best Looking wings I've ever seen (haven't tried them yet) Wine on tap (Mike Weir $1/ounce) Great atmosphere! So happy it's here Chicken and waffles also look piiiiiiiimp"}
{"text":"Came to this place because our original Friday night choices had crazy line ups. It's fairly small but seems to be a humble local spot. Everyone who came in were super friendly and familiar with the staff, which I can understand given that I don't think there's anything too special about this place that someone not in the area would travel over to Leslieville for.   The decor is quite \"hipster\" with the dim lighting, neon lights, and hand written menu. I ordered the dry rub ribs ($15) which were actually pretty damn amazing. The dry rub is good by itself, but their BBQ sauce is to die for. I'm sure I used up half the bottle by the time I finished my ribs. The ribs only came with a piece of white wonderbread, which I felt was a bit lacking. Portion looks small at first but ends up being quite filling. Unfortunately, this and the beef brisket would be the only things of the small food menu I would order."}
{"text":"Drove by with my Vball team on our way to Prohibition and my friend recognized this place. She's been to AAA bar (triple A) the other location near Adelaide and Jarvis and recommended it. And so this time we went here instead and I agree it's a gem.  Environment  Now I haven't been to the other location but I've heard this one is significantly smaller than the other. There are only a few tables and we joined 3 for 6 of us. That was probably half the capacity for table seating in the restaurant. Very hip, Dimly lit, wooden worn tables with pen etches on it. The menus really stood out as they are on individual pieces of construction paper, each hand written by different people. Don't expect it to be fancy as the food comes out in paper plates and the brisket comes with some regular square bread.   Food Simple small menu featuring Texas bbq and southern dishes. I've heard great things about their ribs but opted for the chicken and waffles ($14) which I say is the perfect savoury sweet. Better than Harlem restaurant downtown. The waffle comes drenched in syrup and sauce which was was yummy and wasn't overly sweet. So if you're concerned with that than I would say ask for sauce on the side! Wednesday special was brisket poutine and also really tasty and comes with a generous portion. My friend ordered the brisket sandwich and said it was great as well.  Mac&cheese was honestly nothing special tasted like Kraft dinner but who doesn't like KD?  Another highlight was the numerous bottles of hot sauces to try and add a kick to your meal $5 pint special for Amsterdam blonde when we were there!  Beer options are are also from local breweries.   Service  Our server had a very quirky and slightly sarcastic humour, which made this experience unique. No complaints here.  Overall The place has a lot character and not easily forgotten. Intimate and great for small group hang outs. Now I love good value matched with tasty food (at least for the choices we ordered) so this will definitely be one of those dives, which I'll come back again."}
