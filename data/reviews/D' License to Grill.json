{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now but last night was the first time we ate a full meal, because I have just stopped in for a cold beer and a snack previously.  We shared the mixed vegetables, which comes like a stew but what sets it apart is the spices, these are real bona fide spices, with chunks of clove and cinnamon - no over the counter powdered spices here.  I find this dish to be a bit spicy, but the thing is it's better spicy, since I have had Ashim (the owner) tone it down for me and when he does it loses a bit of its lustre.   The chicken tikka is really wonderful, generous chunks of juicy chicken and great flavours.  They really do go over the top (in a good way) with their use of spices at this place.  My friends had a lamb dish that wasn't on the menu, ask the owner for something \"off menu\" and he'll be happy to oblige.  They actually ordered a second one because they liked it so much.  I had a bite and the lamb was so nicely coked and juicy, I could see that it was great but it was a 10 on the spicy scale so too much for me (note; for me, who loves but can't handle spicy, this restaurant presents a bit of a challenge b/c the spicing ranges from 5-10, and I'm more of a 3 or 4 guy).  I also had an Opening Special, which was a chicken kabob and salad and again, it's not on the regular menu but if you hurry in it may still be on.  It was a little more in my spice range.  The na'an here is great (lighter and fluffier than the roti), but the highlight of sides is the basmati rice.  I should have taken a picture of it, it's colourful thanks to the real spices that are used throughout - it's fragrant and tastes wonderful.  So it's great - but any cons?  Well, like another reviewer I got the gears for asking for my dishes mild (he asks me, \"Then what are you doing here?\") - but he is so personable and genuine that we made friends shortly after.  The patio is not yet licensed, but I know he's fighting with the city on that so it should be soon.  There is an automatic air freshener that goes off every 15 mins. that I find annoying.  It's kind of a one man show, so don't expect to be greeted at the door, since he may be in the back cooking. The d√©cor is not exactly fancy, so if you're looking to impress with visuals maybe go to Gautama, if you're looking to impress with food definitely come here.  Right now it's my secret spot, but I have a feeling that word of mouth will make this place busy, I hope that as an early adopter Ashim will keep a place for me.  Hopefully on the corner of the patio once he gets the green light from the AGCO :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. The vegetarian options were super tasty. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This may be one of the best Indian food restaurants I've eaten at in Toronto. The flavors are all wonderful. Delicious. Good service. But if you're looking for someplace really like serious this is not the place to be. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian we've ever had!   We ordered the tandoori chicken, butter chicken, chicken korma, palak paneer, and the lamb curry...it was all wonderful! The meat was very tender, and the spices/sauces used were excellent.   Thank you, Ashim and the rest of the D'License staff for a memorable meal!"}
{"text":"The chicken tikka here is great, pungent and noisy and strong. We also had the mattar paneer, which, while soupier than many on the strip, has great flavour. They didn't puree all the spices so you get individual tastes and textures on the tongue and I kinda like that.  Also had the chana masala which had more masala than chana but maybe there's a shortage of peas from the chick heritage, who knows. The flavour was good.   One truly exciting thing about this joint is that they are applying for a liquor license. Wouldn't it be nice to have a beer with your meal? Or just go out for a beer and some snacks? (The snacks here apparently are great but this is hearsay.) The only other choice for beer around here is the kick'n'stab, and I value my life too much.  Update: I hadn't been back here for a while but the other night we got a mess of takeout and I was blown away. First, I have to recommend the dish called Dhaba. Yes, it's spicy, but it has these superb fried coriander seeds swimming all around, and it's fragrant, nutty, floral, and delivers a lot of bang for the buck. Also we had the lamb korma, which was amazing, and some kind of fish which I can't recall, and of course the tikka masala.  This place really delivers when it comes to massive flavour and (here's what matters) different flavour. Some places just change the chilis and call it a changed dish; this place has subtlety, variety and of course, chilis. Well done and I hope this place sticks around for several years.  Oh and yes, they have beer."}
{"text":"I love sitting on the patio, with beer, Naan and various menu items, especially the naan, which I wrap around the  Shrimp or chicken Masala, with ginger and garlic and  tandoori cubes in onions tomatoes & other herbs, spiced hot enough for taste buds  Closed down as of Sept 1st 2014"}
{"text":"The food was exceptional and the service was very good. If you like Indian food and are looking for an authentic experience you will not be disappointed. A wonderful experience we will repeat soon!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood and have tried most of the restaurants in Little India. This is one of the best. The original owner of the BBQ Hut runs this place and is the chef. His food is very authentic and simply amazing. The restaurant is actually just north of Gerrard  St. across from the Ashdale library. With live Indian music on the weekends and constantly changing specials, you will not be disappointed. Best naan and  tandori chicken around."}
{"text":"The food here is EXCELLENT! Everything has a potent spice to it and it smells delicious from blocks away. You have to try this place"}
