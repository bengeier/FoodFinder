{"text":"Delicious food, excellent service! This place is a real gem for anyone seeking great authentic Mexican cuisine. The salsa was the best I've ever had! Try the chorizo tacos and you won't be disappointed. Generous portions and great prices. I will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome! The best way to describe this place is fresh. Food was steaming hot, and portion sizes great. I've lived in LA and spent a lot of time in Texas, outside of those two places this is as close to authentic that I've had in Calgary."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch after getting my hair done at Diva Salon. Great place for lunch, it's new so not too busy. I had the chicken quesadilla, it was delicious! Love the guacamole too!"}
{"text":"This place is just cute. It's colourful, small (read: cosy), staffed only by sweet older gentlemen as far as I've seen, tasty and reasonably priced food (all mains are $18 or less - and the $18 one is BIG!) and a decent selection of drinks.  They have some great nightly specials (I went on a Monday night when they have 2 for 1 mains), and other nights are all you can eat xxx for around $14.   I can attest to their lime margaritas ($6 single/$8ish double - I like mine as a double personally!) and my friend really enjoyed her pina colada. I was even offered my choice of a slushy or on the rocks version for my margarita which was good service. On another occasion a friend had one of their strawberry daiquiri and she noticed it tasted slightly of cinnamon. Apparently they roast the strawberries on site with cinnamon! Yum! I also had my first (and second) bulldog drink here which was fun.  I had the nachoes the first time I came, and loved the spicy, pickled veggies that came on the side! We also had the Three Amigos entree, a great combination of easy to share tapas that were a little on the fried/heavy side but great with martinis/daiquiries/bulldogs! A few days ago I tried their $18 dinner combo, including a beef burrito (1 lb from memory - I had to get the second half to go). My only comment is that I would've liked more veggies (the burrito was just meat and rice) but it was all pretty tasty.  It has a quiet and charmingly small atmosphere, I've never seen any more than a few small tables taken at a time of groups of 2 - 4 people. I just wish you could people watch a bit more through the windows as it's right on 17th Ave..."}
{"text":"Mexican corner eatery  I'd read many positive reviews about this restaurant so I decided to check it out.  It was a supposed to open at 11:30 but when I tried the door at close to 12 it was locked.  They seemed to be involved in some real estate business and had neglected to open the door.  The prices are quite good for lunch.  The lunch entrees seemed to be all priced at $10 and $11.  I decided to get the mixed enchiladas.  One was beef, one was chorizo and one was chicken.  There wasn't much taste difference  between them.  They were served with a choice of sauce and rice.  I found the portion size to be on the small side and not terribly hot temperature wise.  I thought the meal to be very average surprisingly because they have gotten good reviews."}
{"text":"What a great Mexican restaurant!!!  Had the chicken enchiladas and it was fantastic!!  Highly recommended the place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"As Twyla said this place provides some excellent flavors and food. I found every sauce to be spot on for the dish it was prepared for, flavorful and tasty. As JM stated the salsa was great. A special thanks for my fellow Yelpers for finding and recommending Mexican Corner as it is real deal."}
{"text":"Happy service, reasonable prices, delicious food! Mexican platter is enormous and flavourful:). The chorizo taquito appetizer was soooo good! Eat here!"}
{"text":"delicious! we tried a bunch of menu items & they were all awesome - the mole sauce that they make is amazing. the service was super friendly and the food came out pretty quick! I will definitely be returning."}
