{"text":"Save your money and go to McDonalds, Burger King or any place other than here.  Food was taste-less, prices were high for \"FAST MESICAN FOOD\".  On a Saturday, I think there were like 3 other customers here.  I should have known better."}
{"text":"I called in a order to go. When I got home I was missing 2 chicken tacos. I had to f=drive all the way back and pick up the rest of my order.  Other than that the food was great, price was very reasonable. The service was very fast. My wife had the fish tacos and I had the chicken tacos, they were some of the best we ever had. I plan on ordering again in the near future.  I'm rating them a 4 star, if they had not checked my order I would have gave them 5 stars."}
{"text":"If you love Los Favoritos you will love this place! The breakfast burritos are the exact same. So nice to have a good Mexican food place like this close by."}
{"text":"Think of it like a nicer Filibertos. Menu is pretty similar but the food is just better. Rice and beans are great, the shredded beef in tacos is flavorful and cooked very well. The Tamales they had around Christmas were a real treat. Be aware that their sauces ARE spicy, so go easy at first until you know what you're getting into. That being said, their red sauce is amazing. Give it a try if you're looking for good, clean, quick Mexican food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Had read some positive reviews and looked forward to enjoying TacoTuesday with our daughter and granddaughter.  Beef tacos were mediocre at best and my combo plate was served with no beans but a double portion of rice. Salsa was not made for a gringo's palate...way too hot.  Other meals ordered were too spicy too eat.  After ordering 4 combo meals and drinks for @ $50 I asked for some chips and salsa...yep...$4.05.  Chips were very good...couldn't take the fire in the salsa.  Not Recommended."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Excited to have a new privately owned restaurant in the area. I think they care more then the chain restaurants (caf√© rio, filibertos) and it definitely shows. #supportlocalbusiness"}
{"text":"Great addition to the area. Service and food is great. The menudo is really good and so are the rolled tacos."}
{"text":"Stopped at Talo's yesterday (4/24/18 at 1:00 pm) not knowing what to expect. Very simple interior, walk to counter to order (to person who did not greet us or offer any info). Asked if they had a Taco Tuesday - NO. Senior discount? - NO. She needs some people training & to speak up & not mumble. I ordered #2 (Taco/cheese enchilada/rice/beans) $8.30 plus $1.90 for a MEDIUM soda. Companion ordered #4 (Taco/burrito/rice/beans) Not sure about that combo price but with drink about the same as mine. Although there were only 2 other people at Talo's, the counter person called out our order numbers (which she had to repeat a couple times) since we could barely hear her (we were in a conversation). It would be nice if she had walked our order to us rather than making us 70ish ladies go back to the counter (about 20 ft) for our food. Also had to go up to counter once again to ask for salsa, which was good (spicy) and both our meals were OK. Don't think we will be back - food ordinary, but $11.03 was a price we would rather pay to have someone come to our table, take our order, answer our questions, & deliver our meals."}
{"text":"I was excited to see this new Mexican place, but after ordering and taking my first bite, I will honestly never go back. Ordered chile relleno, cheese enchiladas, with rice and guacamole... I have NEVER had Mexican food that had almost no flavor whatsoever, no spices, no salt, nothing... How is that even possible? Very disappointed, don't waste your money. I could go to Filiberto's or even Taco Bell for better Mexican food..."}
{"text":"Have to be honest, the food is just average and seems slightly over priced for what you get.  The caliber of food is the same as Filibertos but you get less food for more money."}
{"text":"Have to highly recommend this place for fresh cooked, great tasting fast Mexican food. My favorites are the Adobada Tacos, Bean and Cheese Burritos, Bacon, egg and cheese Breakfast Burritos, Carne Asada Burritos, Fish Tacos and Spanish Rice. The food is ALWAYS made fresh when you order. Have eaten at quite a few Mexican Fast food restaurants in Mesa Area, including Filiberto's and Los Favorito's but l drive the extra miles it takes to get here because l know the food will be worth it. This is not a food chain owned by a corporation, but a small business owner. I don't mind paying a little more for a meal that is fresh, hot, not greasy and prepared when l get there. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean and comfortable. If you live in the area, give Talo's a try!!"}
{"text":"Quick Mexican food for if you're in the area, but definitely generic like Filbertos is. Not bad, just not something I go out of the way for!"}
{"text":"Talo's is awesome! Clean Restaurant. Food is always fresh and hot and made with quality, fresh ingredients. I highly recommend the California burrito. Keep it up Talo's!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out and no complaints. Your typical fast Mexican food. Employees were nice!"}
{"text":"If you're familiar with Los Favoritos then you will see the same service and flavor as that. It's not the best mexican food I've had but for being the place it is I still enjoy it. I just recommend being able to substitute instead of paying for every item such as cheese and sour cream"}
{"text":"I made a visit to Talo's before hitting a movie across the street at the AMC theater. As Mexican fare goes, I feel like this stacks up. This is by no means a fancy restaurant, but it is clean, reasonably priced, and the food is worth what you pay. (although the combos don't come with a drink). I selected the #1, which consists of a Chile Relleno, Cheese Enchilada, Rice, and Beans. The Chile had good texture. It was not at all soggy, and the cheese as well as the Enchilada Sauce was really good. It was mild in temp and had a nice consistency. They do provide bottles of green and red sauce. I had some red sauce on my rice, and it was a bit hot for my liking. The rice and beans were good, although the rice had corn and carrots in it. I would prefer just straight rice with the seasoning. The lettuce on top of my food was very crisp and fresh! That was a nice addition to the meal. The only complaint I had presentation wise is that the meals come in the cafeteria style plating, where everything is sectioned off. I like a regular plate where I can mix my food easier.   My bottom line here is that I think this is a spot worth checking out. I'm always eager to support local businesses, and I had no regret in doing so here."}
{"text":"So thought we would give the new place a try. It's decorated like a want to be Filbertos and not nearly as nice as Rudy's. The young girl at the front counter was completely disinterested in working and had no clue how to work the register. We ordered a few al la cart tacos and it was $6. No big deal, but then we added a small side rice and beans and it was another $6!!!! We asked if it was right and young girl asked the kitchen and it was correct. Overall the food was average at best. No reason to return to this establishment."}
{"text":"As mentioned by another review, this place is a great addition to the area. Family style restaurant among a sea of chain restaurants. Good food and decent prices."}
{"text":"One of the first things I use to judge any Mexican food restaurant is the taste and quality of their rice, and beans.  If a Mexican food restaurant cannot get that right, I probably won't be back.  Most taco stand/fast food style places over cook their rice, and refry their beans multiple times, but Talo's did a very nice job with theirs.  I had the green chile plate and very happy with the flavor and freshness of the meal.  The restaurant is new, and very clean. The service was polite and friendly.  I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"The food was exceptional, but the lady who was working the cash register in the front was extremely rude and did not seem to want to be there. We were polite and even had other friends who came in and ordered to-go, and were treated with the same rude treatment and complained to me as well. Food is good but I hope she turns that frown upside down!!"}
{"text":"Have nothing good to say about it. It's almost as bad as Filibertos. Would Recomment Rudys Burritos. Taste way better, service is great, and just all around fantastic. Not recommending this place to anyone.."}
{"text":"Im so happy this place opened. Great customer service and awesome food. Make sure to ask for the homemade salsa but be careful it is super hot."}
{"text":"When we saw this new restaurant near our house open, of course we went in to try it. It was clean, but no real decorating or \"vibe\" of any sort. We walked up to the counter to order and the order board menu / combinations looks exactly like Filiberto's or Los Favoritos. Girl at the counter was not rude by any means, but was afraid to talk to us it seemed like. Very poor communication skills, and her hair honestly looked like she just rolled out of bed. Food is served in styrofoam which I'm not a fan of, it's so bad for the environment. We ordered 2 combos (no drinks) and it was $20. Quite pricey and mediocre portion sizes. Portions weren't small, but they didn't leave us feeling very filled up so I do think it's over priced, especially when you don't get a drink with a $9 combo for a place you have to walk up and order your own food and get your own napkins and utensils. The food was good, but beef was lacking a lot of flavor and seasoning. The best part was the homemade taco shell, you could tell it was homemade. But, they're pretty thin so the bottom of the taco sitting in the sauce for our 5 minute drive home had already softened it enough to wear the taco had completely cracked open."}
{"text":"Good food! People are nice too! Very tasty and nice location close to the movie theater and other amenities."}
{"text":"The the burrito was the width of the tray. Not the length of the tray . which was great. I had 2 use both hands. He came with potatoes and cheese and eggs . which is extra in most cases. It was hot fresh and filling. They gave me 2 bottles of Chile red and green. And both were chilled. A plus.i will be going back, but the cost is way to much  $$.it's a very small kitchen only 3 people at the time. Clean and kept up."}
{"text":"First time trying this place since it opened and I was hoping it would be much better than it was. Place was clean and staff was nice but food was blah. No flavor whatsoever. Ordered a #2 combo- beef taco and cheese enchilada. The enchilada was cold and the cheese was still shredded and not melted at all. Beef taco was warm but flavorless. Rice and beans also cold and bland. The hot sauce didn't even help. I don't think I will be back which is unfortunate."}
{"text":"We have gotten take out three times, and have loved it every time! Their rice and beans are super good. Just a heads up, their beef enchiladas have veggies and onion in them. They are still yummy, I just wasn't expecting that. Their carne asada also has great flavoring. I would definitely recommend trying this place!!"}
{"text":"Not good, no presentation, the ingredients seemed heated up in a microwave. The space is not set up properly. I won't be back"}
{"text":"Excellent place! I went to the restaurant twice before leaving a review to make sure I could try a few dishes and give a decent review. Best fish tacos ever,  really. All dishes very tasty... great place when you are in need of a taco (happens to me often).  This is a take out type place,  fast...delicious!!! Great portion size too!"}
{"text":"Super rude employees and six dollar rice and beans we walked out after beginning to place our order because of the bad vibe and bad feeling"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place until I found out no salsa bar. Was sad when they said the carrots were extra. $3.55 for 2 small bags. Fili b's doesn't charge but anyway we'll see how the food tastes. Unless it's Amazing I I won't be back."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We first saw the menu on the Yelp page--very reminiscent of a Filiberto's. However, when we went to pick up the food, the interior was nicer than that of a Filiberto's. Everyone appeared to be very friendly. We ordered to go, and they served it for here--they fixed it quickly. We ordered the chips and guacamole, chicken enchilada plate, and a carne asada burrito. Again, another reminder of Filiberto's. The food tastes quite identical; however, I'd probably stick with Filiberto's. Overall, it's cheap Mexican food identical with any \"berto's\" in the valley."}
{"text":"Very good food & large portions ...we will return! Chimichanga, rolled tacos and chips & salsa were great."}
{"text":"Some of the best Menudo we have ever tried. Would highly recommend it if you like Menudo on the weekend,"}
{"text":"I've been there twice this week and on my way for a third time. I love it. The food is fresh, salsa delicious (a wee bit spicy) and the place a clean. So happy to have a simple, delicious authentic Mexican place so close. I love it!"}
{"text":"All the food was cold and not made in house. It's 6:30pm and no customers here. Do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very fresh, authentic Mexican. Between us we had tacos and chips and salsa. The chips were hot out of the fryer, very fresh and crisp! We love spicy hot, however the salsa was too spicy for our palate. The tacos were great! We ordered hard shell tacos which again were fresh from the fryer, homemade warm and crispy. The shredded chicken was very moist and generous portion. The carnita (shredded pork) was great and included guacamole. The chicken Asada was tiny chopped grilled chicken, very ample amount. Overall was made to order and very fresh. The young lady at the counter was very sweet. Seems like a family run business which we love to support!"}
{"text":"We've been there a handful of times. No issues so far. Seems like a cleaner establishment than some of the other chains like Los Favs or Filibertos. 5 stars for now."}
