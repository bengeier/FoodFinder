{"text":"T?K's food is delicious! I have been here more times than I can count in the past month, and the quality of food never fails. I look forward to seeing what each new month brings from their kitchen. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Beautiful location, great place to sit, eat, and talk. Small menu but all delicious! Has a good drink selection as well."}
{"text":"We had to see it to believe it!  The Yelp announcement that Tuk had opened was intriguing and the other positive reviews made it our go to place for lunch.  Each of us ordered something different and the 3 of us were all pleased with our selections, salad with grilled chicken, butternut squash soup and a flatbread selection were tasty and satisfying.  We enjoyed the comfortable seating and found a quiet table on the second floor in the \"Library\" area where we could relax and spend some time in conversation and a game or two of dominoes.  We plan to return.  Yes, the Press coffee was a big plus.  Suggestion:  sell the beans on site.  The staff went out of their way to be courteous and friendly.    Many thanks."}
{"text":"Beautiful place inside and out. We brought our doggie and enjoyed the patio. The staff was so friendly and helpful and brought him a treat. :)

We had the veg-out bowl, chorizo green chili frittatas, and blueberry pancakes. Food was good and so were the bottomless mimosas!  Great ambiance."}
{"text":"This cafe is a treasure. The space is beautiful and a wonderful place to just go, get a coffee, or spend time with friends. And the food is great! Everything I've eaten there is always wonderful. The price also can't be beat. Would recommend 1000x over"}
{"text":"Yelp fail! This is a senior assisted living cafeteria disguised as a hip coffee shop. I've had better food and coffee at gas stations."}
{"text":"Not sure what took me so long to go here, especially since I'm within walking distance.  But if you're looking for a perfect breakfast/lunch spot, go no further. 

Went here for lunch with my lady. We both got a lunch entree and a cup of soup. The price is so cheap that it's ridiculous. I got a perfectly cooked burger with homemade potato chips for less than $7.  You'd never know by the taste and quality of the food. Top notch burger. They also change the menu monthly to keep it fresh. More places should follow this practice. 

I've reviewed several local restaurants on Yelp. Tuk is by far the nicest looking one I've been to so far. Granted, it is quite new. But the inside and out are gorgeous. 

I, as well as other reviewers, find it a little strange that it is part of an old folks home. But trust me, I'm glad I didn't let that deter me from finally going in.  So just ignore that little tidbit. It will be worth it."}
{"text":"I am going to miss this place once it gets too busy for me. We came in on a Saturday morning. No one was in there, but us. It was pleasant. We got to tour the place with no one in the space. There is a \"old folks\" home connected to the restaurant, but the general public is invited to dine as well. The menu changes I think from month to month. We ordered our breakfast bowl and dh ordered french toast to go with his meal. The eggs were cooked to perfection and the salad that accompanied the bowl breakfast were fresh. The prices are very good for Ahwatukee. The freshness is above and beyond. 

The sound system in the place is great. They were playing a lot of my favorite songs that morning. I loved it. There is also outside dining, but we will try that out later when it is cooler. The space inside is just right for temperature. Neither hot nor cold. The location is beautiful and full of cheer. I could see myself enjoying a book in one of the corner sets.

What makes this location really special is the beer, wine, and liquor selections. They even carry local bees like Huss! We plan on enjoying dinner there soon to try out the beer.

Go to counter to order then find where you would like to sit. They bring it out to you."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have had in metro Phoenix. Onion rings are also out of this world. And great prices to boot.  Very nice atmosphere with an upstairs balcony or seating on the main level. The only unusual aspect of this place is that it is inside of a senior living complex. It's also 100 yards or so off the main drag of Chandler Boulevard so you have to search for a little bit. Definitely worth searching for"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here yesterday at noon.  The food was wonderful.  I had a Mediterranean salad with grilled shrimp.  It was terrific.  He had a hamburger and it was also great.  We ate outside under the umbrellas and the weather was great.  There were several people who were also eating lunch.  The ladies next to us said that this is their new favorite spot.  They were having a bottle of wine (kept in a cooler) and really enjoying themselves too.  We will be back.  The food was great and the prices were amazing.  I have seen where some thought the service was slow.  However, I just think that is how long it takes to grill a burger."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this hide away. Food, cost, service and environment is great. Yes it's odd location being a part of senior living building. But the standards seem to be high. Comfy chairs available to. Seating indoors and outdoors."}
{"text":"Very cool little place, nice ambience. Lots of space and not very crowded. Music playing at an appropriate level. Very comfortable and chill. Coffee was good. I got the Sunday brunch special omelette, which was only $5.50, very reasonable price. Quality and portion size didn't blow me away, but it filled me up and tasted decent, especially for the price. They claim to have a full-service bar but couldn't even make me a bloody Mary, and this was Sunday morning at 10 AM, which is prime brunch time. They need to work on their drink game. Not being able to make a bloody Mary for brunch is sort of a crime for a place that claims a full service bar."}
{"text":"A quiet spot for a very reasonably priced breakfast. I tried the breakfast bowl and it was SO good. The coffee was great and the atmosphere was great too. We sat upstairs and it was the perfect spot for the four of us, all by ourselves. I am excited to go back when the big garage doors/windows are open. I just love that! Needless to say, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Good food at reasonable prices. 2 brunches with 2 drinks for $15. I got the blueberry granola pancakes (qty 4) which were really  good. I had a bite of my mom's omelet, which was a combination of of sausage, cheese, spinach and tomatoes and that was also quite good. There were no sides to the omelet (no potatoes or toast or whatever) but my mom's appetite was satisfied at the end. I couldn't finish the pancakes as it was a lot. 
I took a look at their alcohol prices and those were really really reasonable."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good- we had the jerk shrimp tacos and the egg and bacon burger. The only reason it's losing a star is because there was some sort of strange photo shoot taking place right next to us..."}
{"text":"I just got a breakfast burrito and cold brewed coffee for less than 10$ (can I say cheap deal) and they we're both really good! The girl that took my order was super awkward but in a na√Øve, earnest way. She just genuinely wanted to make sure I knew about everything they offered. Very quite relaxed spot I think they have bags in the back. Very happy I stopped by here!"}

Well came back again for breakfast & coffee (press coffee) had A vegetable omelette and coffee for less than 10 bucks how awesome is that. Location may be an odd area with the senior place next store but you would never know it, and also plenty of seating great place to do a business lunch or breakfast or just to hang out with friends.
My new hang out"}
{"text":"Great ambience and great food for very reasonable prices
I had the classic margarita flatbread which was absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"Great place with great food served in sensible sized portions and very reasonable prices, employees are very friendly and accommodating as well. So happy to have found this spot."}
{"text":"Child size portions is not what I was looking for after a long morning. Had an omelette that had uncooked bacon and no spice at all. Only fountain drink cups that have are a small size and no refills. Meal price wasn't bad $8.64 for the omelette, hash browns and lemonade. Best thing is the cafe itself. Great meeting place with cozy furniture and lots of open air."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fantastic drinks, and fantastic staff all for an extremely reasonable price! I would recommend 10/10!"}
{"text":"I wanted to go here ever since this place was opened. It is located at the generation senior living place. I would not even know about this place without yelp. It is very spacious and very clean but i was more surprised by senior living residence which looked like five star hotel. We ordered the aloha burger and bacon avocado salad along with the coffee which is same as the \"press coffee\" which i like. When the food came out, i was pretty dang surprised. The burger was really cooked well and the salad was pretty good. I was looking for the place where i could work for awhile and it has great upstair space with comfy sofas and full of boring books. I will probably go there often from now."}
{"text":"Decent food, great value, but the service needs attention!

Recommended, but with caveats (read on...)

I discovered T?K Urban Cafe when one of my Yelp friends bookmarked it. It's located in far southeastern Ahwatukee, hence the neat name: T?K's! Since it's nearby, five of us decided to try it for Sunday brunch. T?K's has been open about a month, so we figured they'd have their act together - but we were wrong!

Food:
I'm happy to say, the food was decent. But we were disappointed that T?K's was't serving their normal \"full\" menu on Sunday. Instead, they had several items listed on a chalk board:  T?K Omelet, Oro Burger, BlueBerry Granola Pancakes, Roast Beef Melt, and Spinach Harvest Salad.

I opted for the T?K Omelet, which was on the small side, but not bad for the price. The flavors were fine, but the omelet didn't have much sausage, so I added some hot sauce to make it more interesting. Like everything we ordered, it was served on a plastic dish with plastic utensils. I also had plain black coffee which was excellent.

My friends ordered the omelet and the Oro Burger. They all agreed, the food was good, and would like to return during the week to try other menu items.

They also have a selection of coffee drinks and a little bar serving alcohol.

Cost:
I paid $7.88 including tax for my omelet and coffee, which I thought was very reasonable.

Service: 
At T?K, you order at the counter and they bring your food when it's ready. This is where the wheels fell off! Five of us ordered at the same time, with four separate checks. Two of us received our drinks fairly quickly, and my omelet wasn't too far behind. But it took a long time for them to bring the other orders - as in probably 15-20 minutes after I received mine! Not only that, they totally lost one person's burger order, and another person's coffee order. We certainly didn't expect this, since they appeared to have plenty of staff. They never came around to the table to check on us, so we finally went to the register to ask for the missing orders. Eventually, one worker (probably the manager) came to check on us, and apologized for the mix-up. 

Atmosphere:
T?K's is a very open space, with an upstairs \"loft\", a spacious downstairs area, and if the weather's good (it was when we were there), large garage doors that open to the outside patios. I really enjoyed the overall feel of the place, with lots of tile and brick. It has a casual feel, and would be a nice place to come and just hang-out.

Overall:
T?K's Urban Cafe has a neat vibe, decent food, and is a good value. They really need to focus on better training for the staff to bring the service to an \"acceptable\" level. The atmosphere and food will bring me back again after a few weeks, and I'll add a star if they improve their service."}
{"text":"Wonderful spot.  I've had breakfast and lunch and WOW.  The Spinach salad with Shrimp was AWESOME, the oatmeal is the best I've ever had, I know, right?   Also had the omelette dish with veggies, yum.  Prices are fabulous and the atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"Very modern cafe. This would be great for meeting someone for lunch. I had the roast beef sliders. Very good. They have cold brew coffee and I had that too. It was good! I'd come here again. I love the ambiance. I wish they'd decorate my house lol"}
{"text":"Overall, I like the place. As others have commented, it is different but has potential. Simple menus that (I assume) regularly change. We got a mix of breakfast and lunch items. Food was tasty and fresh with the cooks trying unique dishes. I'd go back as I want to see what else they have. What I enjoy the most is that the place is calm and not crowded. Lots of comfortable inside and outside seating."}
{"text":"Delicious, with super reasonable prices and a cool aesthetic feel. They have a wide selection of options, from cold brew on tap to beer and wine. Not what we expected, but 100 percent worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Good food, fast service, cool ambiance. Great place for kids since it's so spacious! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"A great, open space for breakfast, lunch, brunch, etc.  Their menus have lots of options with fresh, yummy favorites and a full bar. Like usual, we ordered everything - omelets, oatmeal, yogurt parfait, Marconi bites, pizza. Loved it all. They did seem a little understaffed however the service ended up being great and food came out fast. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Super cute place, food is good and not pricey. They have a nice outdoor patio too with games you can play. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Now, I know I'm an old soul, so maybe it's no surprise I would really like a place attached to a senior centre.  I'm upstairs right now enjoying a coffee (Press Coffee is served here!) after stumbling onto this space looking for somewhere quiet to get some studying! This place is dead right now, which makes it the perfect space for me to study right now. The location is a bit odd, but it's a really cool space and worth going a bit out of your way for. 

It's got a really comfortable, home-y feel to the place. It's not overdone either, and a lot of places go wrong there. The service is really friendly and attentive. We haven't tried the food so I can't speak to it, but the menu looks really good!

If you're in the area, definitely come give this a try!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place to spend the afternoon working & lunch. Beautiful decor. Well done. Quiet. Affordable menu. Hidden gem. Easy access to I-10."}
{"text":"Nice and tranquil such a nice place to read books, chat, and enjoy a weekend afternoon!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times already and it is by far one of my new favorite local restaurants!! They have a new menu selection almost every time I go and no matter what I choose it is good AND cheap! The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, always willing to offer their assistance! The decor alone makes me want to dine here all the time, it's just an added bonus that the food and service rocks!"}
{"text":"What a strange and wonderful place. Yes, it's housed in a senior care facility. No, it's not that weird. 

Rob W. turned to me this past weekend and goes- I found somewhere new to study at. Trust me? I did.  Sometimes it's against my better judgment. It worked out, like it usually does though, so we found ourselves at Tuk. 

Service: the lady helping us out was sweet and really informative. I was happy to order from her.  You could tell that she genuinely cared about making sure everybody was having a good time. You order from the counter and then find a seat somewhere in the gorgeous building. 

Atmosphere: I had no idea this was in a senior care facility. The bottom level looks really modern and open. The upper level is cozy and clean with plenty of seating. 

Food: We got a couple coffees and an order of the Baja shrimp tacos with tater tots. On the whole everything was inexpensive. The shrimp were large and tasty. My issues were with the shrimp batter and lack of toppings. The batter was overwhelming and the toppings consisted of a very small amount of cabbage. It was topped with a creamy orange dressing. Not bad, but a couple of tweaks would make it a winner. 

Coffee was good and smooth. 

It's a cute place to meet and study. I'll be back."}
{"text":"You cannot find a better price-to-quality ratio in all of greater Phoenix than at T?k. I have become a pretty consistent regular.  It has a completely unique vibe about it -- perfect study/work spot if you're over the over-priced coffee shop scene.  The monthly rotating menu is frustrating, only because they replace really great food with more really great food and I'm not able to get bored with them. Don't pass over it because of the location, it is well worth trying (and returning)!"}
{"text":"I  had the Oro burger with onion rings and an iced Americano.
Hamburger and onion rings were good. Americano was also good.  The service was friendly and fast.  As other reviewers have noted the location is a bit odd. The building is beautiful inside, open and welcoming.  The space is really cool, with great natural light.

I would return, but it's a bit far south for my normal lunch hour"}
