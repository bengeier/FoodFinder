{"text":"Wonderful food and very affordable! The restaurant is a very \"hole in the wall\" place but the food they serve is very fresh and is made to order! The staff are friendly enough... However you do need to know what you want to order they feel a bit pushy on hurrying you for what you want! They have wonderful combo dishes and very affordable lunch specials! Definitely a place to try if your in the area! My favorite is the sweet and sour pork! And there candied banana or apple slices! Really yummy!"}
{"text":"If your taste buds are looking for some Chinese food goodness, this is the place to go. (warning, may be greasy for your taste) . I admit, I urge to come here every three months. \"Stephen\" will remember when your last visit was (creepy). :-)"}
{"text":"A great small Chinese restaurant.  Love their crispy ginger beef and their spring rolls.  We mainly takeout from here but you can eat in.  Small location but it has a few tables and seats. Love that when you spend over a certain amount you get something for free :) BONUS!"}
{"text":"Great deal if buying the combo packs. Fast delivery and very friendly. Overall it wasnt the best chinese Iv ever had, but it satisfies the craving for a fair price and large portions."}
{"text":"I have to be in the right mood for Chinese food, mainly cause I never feel well afterwards, so have to amp myself up for a night of suffering.  But this Sunday, I was in the mood for some shiny nose food (as my friend's toddler would say). We had ordered delivery from Apple Inn about this time last year. We must have literally ordered the restaurant out of food, cause when the delivery came, he had the food stacked in two giant tupperware bins. The kind you use for moving.  Though we didn't get to keep those bins, I remembered enjoying the food. So we were excited to be the bearers of Chinese food and pick it up on the way to our friend's place to watch S4 Ep2 of GOT (yayyyyy Joffrey).  I called ahead, was told it would take 20 mins. Got there 5 after the time, paid, and was told it wasn't ready yet. Took another 20 mins. The guy was nice though and brought us each a glass of water while we waited.  There are seats to eat in here amongst pink stucco walls. This restaurant is also situated on the worst block of parking ever created. It's kind of like an Escher drawing and you think you can fit but the parking lot narrows off at the end as you drive in. You basically have to see it to believe it.  Got the food, it was all really good. Except for the inclusion of baby corn. Stupid mutant vegetable. That is just my own personal distaste, though.  If your order over $40 you can get an order of ginger beef free. The pieces are nice and large and don't come with the usual mince of vegetables, but big pieces of carrot, onion and green peppers. Also best pork dumplings I have had in this city. YUM!  I will eat here again, but just add on another 30 mins to the time they tell me for pick up."}
