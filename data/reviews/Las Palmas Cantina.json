{"text":"Wife and I got a night out and had wanted to try this new spot in DTC.  I ordered a House Margarita and My Wife had the Mexican Mule - both drinks tasted like they should have, good - not extraordinary.

The chips and salsa were okay - it had the fire roasted taste and NOT the fresh pico de gallo type salsa that I typically prefer.

One of my biggest gripes is the portions - I had the Tuna ceviche, the flavor was very very good, probably 9 out of 10 (tasted like Mexican sashimi) but for the price it would have cost me 4 orders and $50 to be full.  I think most of their dishes are meant to share but it would take a lot of money and mixing for couples or big groups to feel satisfied.  My wife doesn't love seafood and just ordered the wings.  They were above average.

Lastly, the decor.  We both thought the decor was the highlight, a true coastal/beachy feel.  We sat at the bar on the back deck and enjoyed the music, fans with misters & overall ambience.  Both bartenders that served us were nice and knowledgeable of ownership, the menu & the cocktails.  Service and patio were the two best things, also really liked the ceviche but for the price, kinda meh.

*One other thing* We sat outside at the bar/patio and didn't know that the menu wasn't a 'full' menu.  This should change in my opinion, it's Arizona, people want to sit outside."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and unique beverage offerings that are out of this world. Light, tropical Mexican cuisine. Las Palmas, my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"I've been so excited for this place to open.  I absolutly LOVE margaritas and Mexican food.  I was bummed that my margarita didn't have a lime garnish.  Trivial, I know,  but Tequila and lime just go together.  I was told \"fun fact\" that they didn't serve limes with the margaritas. All the other fun drinks have pretty garnish though?  Plus the margarita isn't exactly cheap.  It was very tasty though!  My group ordered nachos,  queso dip, and fish tacos.  Nachos were very small and didn't have a lot of stuff on them.  Queso was not good at all.  Very bland,  didn't have a cheesy cheese and hardened before I was able to dig in.  Plus it's served with only 4 (maybe 5?) corn tortillas.  Tasted more like corn than cheese.  The fish tacos were very flavorful and a good portion too!  The salsa that they brought beforehand was also very good!  Service was excellent!  They always kept our waters and drinks full.  The decor was designed well but did not make me feel like I was at the beach.  I felt more like I was in South Beach Miami and felt very out of place in my gym clothes.  Def did not have enough bling on. Seems more like a date night rather than a happy hour with friends unfortunetly.  For me anyways."}
{"text":"The place is awesome, you do really feel at the beach. An innovative concept that makes the place different and unique in the whole valley. Food is great and a smart menu that fits almost every taste. The vibe of the personnel shines, they know what they do but also enjoy doing it. The place will become an oblogied center of reunion to whomever claims to have known the best the whole valley has to offer."}
{"text":"Great New Mexican Restaurant in Downtown Chandler! Excellent service, everyone was very nice. My husband and I sat at the bar. House margarita is very good. Chips and salsa also very good. We ordered the queso dip, very good as other reviewers have said. We wanted to share a taco plate and were told we couldn't mix and match the tacos yet. They said the kitchen couldn't do that yet but soon. Seemed a bit strange. We normally go to a certain taco spot in downtown Gilbert which we like a lot. Las Palmas will be equal
When they expand the menu a bit."}
{"text":"Holy smokes I had a great time here last night.  If you are not familiar, Las Palmas Cantina opened up in the old Vintage 95 location in DT Chandler on Boston St.  It is prime location and they did a great job renovating and opening the space up.  We were greeted at the door by who I think was the owner who also owns the Pedal Haus Brewery in Tempe.  He was very warm and welcoming as was the entire staff in the restaurant.  I met two of the managers and they sat and talked to us for a while and were really cool and fun.  As the night progressed it just kept getting better as we dove into some of the food after a few rounds of Pedal Haus IPA.  

The Hot Queso Dip was so damn good that I ordered another.  The flavors of corn and the mix of high-quality cheese were unlike any other I've had.  We then jumped into a shrimp cocktail which was served in a glass and was also perfect.  The shrimp was very tender and flavorful and the goodies mixed in with them made the whole thing perfect.  

We were offered a few \"mistake\" drinks and I got to try the house Margarita and a sangria - both were again.... perfect.  Enough so that I continued on with a few more Margarita all of which were consistently wonderful.  

I really have to mention how friendly, happy, bright, and wonderful all of the staff were.  We talked to so many of them and they were all tons of fun and we always had exactly what we needed.  I'm not sure how you find such good people in the restaurant biz here but the hiring manager has a good eye for talent.  

The patio was not open yet but they said it would be ready today (5/17).  It again is open with standing tables, decking, and a smaller area with seating.  It reminds me of something you would see near the shore and they did a great job decorating it.  

The \"official opening\" is this Sat 5/19 and if their soft opening is any indicator, they will be ready and well oiled.

Las Palmas - great concept - great service - great food.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Came in during opening weekend but was disappointed. Drinks took over 20 minutes to come out, then fell flat, nothing unique about these drinks. The food was also just very mediocre. I have had queso at many places and never seen it curdle, seems like they may have added cream to get more bang for their buck, but it did not look pretty or taste good when it got to the table. Overall this place was just ok, hoping they fix their menu."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time last night and was disappointed on many fronts.They were not too busy when we arrived and the hostess recommended we sit on the outside deck. It was very comfortable, but then our server explained that it was a limited menu for the deck . We should have asked to be reseated, but we had already settled in. We ordered mussels, nachos, and Mexican corn which was the best thing we got. The mussels were over cooked and way to tart. The nachos looked great, but then disappointment set in because they were cold , the queso was thick and had very little flavor. Service was slow with just one server for many tables. Sorry we will not return."}
{"text":"Took a shot at this new place in downtown Chandler and was seriously impressed. We're from Colorado and luckily have great Mexican food there. This place had some of the best apps, salads and tacos that we've ever tried. Modern twist on the food and solid, creative cocktails to match. Must try if you're in the area. Muy bueno!"}
{"text":"Father's day res for 5. Had the name mixed up, wanted to seat us on patio (not what I had tequested) thought res was for 4. Chaos at check-in but did get our inside table. Waiter was not very enthusiastic, not very speedy, and not very accurate. Ordered hot queso dip for app. was good but a very small serving. Had to get our own silverware and napkins (after asking). Asked for beverage refills and he filled two waters at the table but poked up the two iced tea and another water and took them to bar station. Brought me back a tea rather than water and he held the glasses up trying to determine who got which tea. Tuna cerviche was very good. Meals came in a timely fashion.Meals were all good. A house margarita on the rocks came as a frozen. Bill showed house marg $5.50 and another entry of blended $2. Had to ask about Father's day discount. Table next to us left because of poor and slow service. Like the food, like the locale but SERVICE must be improved. Would have a hard time recommending due to service. Food good."}
{"text":"For being open less than a month, it was quite packed inside when we arrived on a Sunday. The decor is great. The house marg was good and not too sweet. There are a ton of GF items on the menu. The pibil was okay... a bit too much like a pot roast for my preference. But the guac was amazing and so was the salsa. We will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"On our way to dinner next door at The Brickyard, we decided to detour and try Las Palmas. The space is completely transformed from the previous Vintage 95, with decor that my wife dubbed \"Southern California hotel\"--bright, airy and simple. Asked if we'd rather sit inside or outside, we opted for the rear \"deck,\" which we didn't realize meant a separate, more limited menu from inside seating. The back deck has a nice beach vibe to it, but unfortunately elevating it a couple of feet above ground level means a particularly good view of the piles of trash around the dumpsters out back.

The server was quick and always attentive. My wife ordered a margarita, and I picked a Pedal Haus IPA. The beer was good, but the margarita came with no more than an inch of the glass rim salted (\"Isn't that bartending 101?\"), and the drink itself was nothing special. For food we ordered the guacamole, street corn, and an order of mahi tacos. While we waited chips and salsa arrived, but proved to be the next disappointment. It had little more flavor than tomato puree. When the food came out, it looked great. Very nice presentation. The street corn was fine but unremarkable, and the guacamole, like the salsa, lacked any strong flavor except the sweetness of the pomegranate seeds sprinkled on top. Again, disappointing. The evening's final disappointment were the tacos. I've eaten a lot of fish tacos. I've never had mahi battered and deep fried. It could have been some generic white fish for all I could tell. I guess I should have read the menu more closely, because I assumed the mahi would be grilled, not turned into fish sticks.

I know that they just opened, so it may be a little unfair to judge. Normally issues with a new restaurant are more about working out the kinks in the service than in the recipes themselves, but the service was excellent. There was simply nothing that we drank or ate that makes us want to go back. It felt like another restaurant where all of the attention went into the aesthetics of the space and the food presentation, and not enough into the flavors of the food. Nothing was bad, but everything was disappointing."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night. Supposedly it was their soft opening. It was a great disappointment. According to articles written about the owner and chef, they are supposed to have fresh seafood and flavorful cuisine.
My shrimp salad had frozen mini shrimp from a bag that had no seasoning. The dressing which was supposed to be a vinegarette just tasted like oil. The shrimp tacos arrived with no shrimp, and the quacamole we ordered for an appetizer came after we were finished eating. It was very good however, in comparison to the meal. The wait staff werent familiar with the food, and all seemed like they had no restaurant experience. It's a great location, and hope the staff and especially the chef can get it together. 
The manager did come to our table and apologize."}
{"text":"I felt like I was back in Playa del Carmen!! The Mezcal selection is one of the best around and the food certainly did not disappoint. We had 2 of the ceviches and the octopus and they were all delicious. The atmosphere is incredible. Great music, friendly staff, we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great addition to Downtown Chandler! Food was excellent and full of flavor.  Had the tuna ceviche and wife had the small plate. Happy hour prices reasonable and atmosphere is very trendy.  Can't wait for live music on weekend as patio area very open and perfect for drinks on a weekend with friends. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is okay but their drinks are really good and back patio is awesome! I suggest going for a night out and enjoying great atmosphere, yummy drinks, and churro ice cream."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks and service ! I love the ambiance and how creative the setting is . You can tell a lot of thought was put into it . The saundinista is awesome ! The chef knows how to make delicious food. We Got to meet the owner ( Julian) and you can tell that the management and the staff loves it here. So refreshing to see . I can't wait to go back.  Thank you for an awesome visit !!"}
{"text":"Hands down... The absolute best Elote!!! Customer Service was fantastic as well as, the atmosphere. This would be a great first date or girls/guys night out place. 

Definitely recommend eating and drinking here!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this restaurant and food. Happy hour every day is a good deal with drinks and discounted small plates. The ribs is a deal at happy hour. Practically a half slab of ribs. Normal prices are on the higher side. Ordered an artichoke appetizer and was one of the smallest artichokes I have ever seen. Cut in half one half probably has six  leaves on it and a stem the size of a pencil. Definitely not worth $9.50 regular price. Wife ordered the chicken dish which was quite good but again on the smaller side for price. 

Increase the portion sizes and will be better value for money spent."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a busy Friday night.  The hostess stated the kitchen was backed up, but if we were okay with that we could get a seat.  We ordered drinks and chips and salsa to start.  The sandia drink I ordered wasn't very good,  and all I could taste was the tequila.  Husband ordered the American Lager.  We split the nachos with chorizo.  They were tasty, but the cheese sauce needed some seasoning aka salt.   The chips used for the nachos were thicker and larger than the ones served with the salsa.   Our waitress was great and the food came pretty quickly for the kitchen being backed up.   I'd like to give it another try and taste some of the other menu items to see if they are better.  Love the patio seating and whole overall vibe of the place."}
{"text":"Perfect night to sit on the patio. Good food, excellent drinks (especially the house Margaritas & Sangria)."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great atmosphere, great service, friendly, warm, and inviting environment. If you want all those things, and feel as though you're literally at a 5-star resort, come to Las Palmas Cantina in Chandler. Bravo!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best place I've been in awhile, great food and the staff is awesome!!! Highly recommend! If they had more stars it would be 10"}
{"text":"Decent at best. Over priced drinks and food. Black beans were microwaved scorching lava hot. The shrimp was the smallest shrimp I've ever seen in my life. Service was mediocre. Disappointed because I was wanting to try this spot for awhile now. Margaritas are watered down, even questioned the bar tender if any tequila was in it, before she dropped the bottle and it broke all over his the floor. Beer taps are not labeled. Terrible service. Overall mainly just disappointed. I came here barely hungry and left starving. Never once was asked for another margarita after one. The bartenders seem like they have zero experience in the industry before working here. I asked the elderly couple next to me before they walked out if they'd recommend this place and their response was \"probably not, it was just okay\".


Edit. Update: this was a 1 star review until the second shift of bartenders came into shift. Jeneva provided 100x better service. Drinks actually tasted like they were supposed to. Service was then on point."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great addition to Chandler. Everything was fabulous. The guacamole had amazing flavors; chips and salsa were delicious; even the tea was superb. We had the mahi mahi tacos with the jicama wraps and steak tacos with 1 jicama and 2 corn tortillas. Delicious. Even our kiddos loved the fruit, chicken tenders and side of waffle fries (they also have a quesadilla for kids, but didn't try this time). For sure check this place out!"}
{"text":"Loved my drink...the bartenders & owner!! Tonight was perfect service, atmosphere & every thing I hoped for in this new place!! Will most definitely be back & hanging out here over the summer"}
{"text":"This place was so good! I had the queso and elote they where both very delicious. The house margarita was delicious also. The waitress was amazing she was very nice. I had the steak tacos for dinner and they where amazing! I would defiantly recommend them. They where cooked perfect. Also the corn tortillas are made fresh there. I will most definitely be back! I have found my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Walked up , and was lucky to get right in. Usually it is so busy . Got here at just the right time I guess. We had the guacamole, beet salad , chicken and brisket . It was amazing . The GM ( Heather ) stopped by , she's so sweet and cordial . You can tell she loves her job . Our gentleman , who dropped off the food ( Christian ) was super knowledgeable, as was our waitress Alyssa . Thank you . All so much ! The drinks were so good too ! If you haven't tried this place , you should !"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and cocktails, coupled with very pleasant staff. Definitely the best spot for drinks in downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"Yesterday I was here for the grand opening. It started at 5 and I got here around 630. It was already packed! We had a party of 4 and was lucky that there was an opening outside in front.  
We started with the drinks. I was pretty surprised that there were many yummy looking items on the menu. I wish that they had, or would have, a small tasting option to try several things.
We were kinda winging it as the server wasn't too familiar with the menu and hadn't personally tried much. She said that the pina colada had been a hit. So Everyone but myself decided to get the pina colada and from what I tried it was yummy! I got the pina mezcalito that had a smokey taste. It wasn't horrible but not my cup of tea. Eventually someone else in the group got the Sandia-nista. It was a yummy refreshing watermelon drink. Not the fake tasting kinda stuff either! There was a slight spicy kick which I wasn't exactly a fan of but I wouldn't be against trying it again (or maybe asking without the spicy syrup).

For apps we had the guacamole and street corn. Both were just ok. Nothing really exciting. They both lacked flavor. I thought the complimentary chips and salsa tasted better.

For the entree my husband and I split the only chicken dish (minus the wings). I thought it was pretty good but my husband thought it was missing flavor.

Seperate from the food - the service was alright. I wish the waitress had some more feedback on the menu. It took quiet a while to get our food and drinks.  The service was great otherwise.

My only complaint is that I wish there were more chicken options. Please add chicken tacos!

I am very curious about their desserts and I do think the ambience is really fun so I will definitely come back. I know they were busy at the grand opening so I would like to give them another try."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new place, the menu looked interesting. I get it just opened so I will give it another shot. That being said...The wait for a margarita was about 20 minutes when they were not even busy. The drinks are ok, doesn't taste like anything an amateur bartender couldn't make at home. We tried the piña colada (meh), a Margarita, a paloma, and Sandia Nista it had chunks of frozen watermelon instead of fresh. 
We also ordered the Himachi ceviche, it was pretty good, would be better if the fish was cooked in like for a bit instead of just raw with aguachile sauce poured over it. The street corn was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Overall ambiance of the place is 4 Stars. Very modern and has an urban vibe. The food was disappointing. The queso has a thin layer of cheese that's stuck to the cast iron, good luck scraping it off and actually eating some. The street corn just tasted like boiled corn with over saturated mayo, bland and no actual flavor. Street tacos were way undercooked and served rare. Shrimp tacos were served with popcorn shrimp vs actual shrimp and were very bland. The tortillas they use are not the best. Portions are too small for the prices they charge. Beer pricing was accurate. Service was good. Most likely will not be back. There are better options nearby."}
{"text":"I've been in several times with various groups and it gets better each time. I love the nachos and the margarita is delicious and generously sized. The atmosphere is beautiful. The service is great especially the helpful and friendly hosts and hostesses."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time tonight and loved EVERYTHING about this place!!! I am so shocked that anyone would have anything negative to say about the food here. My boyfriend and I split the nachos, mahi mahi tacos, and the veggie tacos on a jicama wrap. All three were absolutely amazing! I almost never feel this way about Mexican food because we cook it so often at home, making me aware of exactly what I like and want on my Mexican food. This place had everything on their dishes that I would include myself. The veggie tacos were seasoned so well and the jicama wraps complimented them perfectly. The fish tacos were super fresh and delicious. The nachos were to die for, with such great toppings and super flavorful guacamole on them. Additionally, this place is decorated so cute and beachy! We sat on the patio and it honestly didn't even feel like we were in Arizona. The service was great and everything was reasonably priced. This will be one of our new go to restaurants!!"}
{"text":"Great experience and new spot in downtown located perfectly. Walking in from the back parking you can tell the vibe was good with everyone enjoying themselves in the back patio. Which is a plus cause of there misters ooh and can't forget the bar in the back.  

Walk inside your get a salsa vibe with nice lighting it's dim elegant and modern. Sat at the bar greeted right away and since being our first time here the bartender JD walked us through the whole menu front and back and offered what he likes best on the menu 

We ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos and steak and it was perfect and the street corn on the cob was out this world. The sauce on it makes it for sure 

Good spot to chill relax have a few drinks and good company."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and chips and salsa! Only thing we have to say is that the taco plate could use a little more to it such as rice or another taco!! Other than that food is tasty and service is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Love the venue! Feels so modern and Chic.  Loved how they have an outdoor seating option with misters. The waitress was super friendly however it did take about 10 min to ask us for drinks. Seems as she must of forgot cause she asked if we ready to order but we hadn't got any drinks yet. Food was very delicious. I ordered and recommend getting the hanger steak. It's very flavorful and presentation is really appealing. I would love to come back at night with the lights dimmed and have a drink. Definitely a place to come on a date at night."}
{"text":"Salsa: excellent, nice acidity and flavor

Watermelon margarita: 2/5, worst part of the meal. Lacked a lot of flavor 

Queso: passable, no complaints

Steak tacos:  5/5 great flavor and tender, good amount of steak

Octopus: amazing and one of the best meals I've had in a while. The beans were full of flavor and the octopus was very tender. Come here for this dish."}
{"text":"Cute place in downtown Chandler. The deck was nice and actually kept cool with the misters. Drinks were great but did take quite a while. All in all, would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I've stopped in twice and while the service improved on the 2nd visit the food quality took a step backwards.

Atmosphere - Great job with the remodel, a good size bar inside and a better bar/deck outside for when the weather is right. The sound system is great and while the music selection was perfect the volume was too loud inside the 2nd visit.

Service - The 1st visit the service was slow after they got busy but the 2nd visit it was perfect. They had plenty of staff and everyone was pleasant. The service was a highlight because the food quality........

Food - Some of the same dishes changed and yesterday's dining was not good. The guac with tostadas is good but they went from fresh fried tostadas with the guac to chips that were prepped hours earlier and the plating wasn't the same. They need to up their game with the regular chips. The Mexican Shrimp Cocktail was great on 1st visit and thought was a go to dish until the 2nd try. Not as good of flavors and too much lime. The grilled corn isn't grilled, it's boiled. The Pork Spare Ribs were a highlight, fall off the bone and the glaze was good. The Shrimp Tacos were a low light, they should put the tortillas on a grill to warm up and the amount of guajillo sauce overwhelmed the shrimp, and too much lime again. The menu looks great but the kitchen execution isn't keeping up.

A lot of potential with the venue/atmosphere & menu, I hope the kitchen catches up."}
{"text":"Terrific ambiance. The chips & salsa are good, and the guacamole is fantastic. The outdoor seating is the best. You have to try this place out!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to be wowed by this new restaurant in downtown Chandler.  Everything was ok, but definitely not amazing.  The shrimp cocktail was very fresh and I enjoyed the diced veggies with the shrimp, but the flavor was very bland and uneventful.  The guacamole was good, but lacked some zing....maybe needs some citrus to enhance the flavor a bit.  The chips were thin and crisp as I like them, but definitely needed some salt.  The salsa was fresh, but very bland and flavorless.  Finally, the margarita....like everything else, was fine but very average.  It almost tasted like a bottled mix and was a bit weak.  It was ok, but didn't make me want to order another.  My initial plan was to start with these items, them order some dinner.  After this uneventful start, I didn't want to spend any more money on more average/bland food and drinks, so left and went to one of my dependable, favorite spots for dinner and drinks.
Overall, the service was good, although quite slow on getting the water, chips and salsa to the table.  One waitress noticed we hadn't received our chips/salsa, so she jumped in and helped out....that was impressive!!  I'm sure this problem was just the newness of the restaurant.  I love the concept of this restaurant, the interior is really nice and inviting.  The patio looks great for some drinks, food and friends.  Hopefully they will improve a bit and develop some more interesting flavor profiles in their food.  I might go back and give it another try, maybe try the ceviche....but definitely not in a rush to go back."}
{"text":"Off to a great start with this place. Hubby and I enjoyed the drinks we ordered(I can be quite picky!)...Bucanero(could taste all ingredients,came with large cinnamon stick..perhaps a bit to large...love cinnamon but was a Tad too much..still enjoyed the drink/hubby had Palma Pina Colada...he really enjoyed w/no complaints!....I next ordered the Sandia-Nista(tequila, watermelon and a few other ingreds)..VERY good but I like spicy drinks!! Then hubby tried House Margarita, homemade sweet/sour..very good! I am extremely picky w/bar margs as the Mix usually rots my gut...this was darn good...we were offered complimentary chips & salsa...chips were thin, good and crispy...salsa seemed to be a light chipotle flavored sauce...not a chipotle fan but this was light and flavorable enough for me to enjoy...from the Small Plates selection I chose Pork Spare Ribs...plenty arrived but looked a bit dry...I underestimated...hubby & I tried them and the word \"deliscious\" came out of both of our mouths!!! Very tender and tasty w/their spicy pineapple achiote glaze....we sat at the bar with Kimberly & Daniel on the ball with our requests! Great atmosphere, food & music. They have a large & very nice outdoor patio area but too warm for us when we arrived just after opening at 4p...leaving at 5.30p the Patio and indoor area are Very busy...Yeah...this place is gonna do just fine!! We'll be back...with others!!"}
