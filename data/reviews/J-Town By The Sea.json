{"text":"They have a nice display of there menu.  Came here for lunch with a friend.   The chirachi Don has Uni!! Which I've never found elsewhere.  And there were many high end sashimi in the rice.  The only con is that it was premade so the rice got a bit dry and cold."}
{"text":"I used to travel 2 hours there just to enjoy the Hokkaido don, and it never disappoints me, now I even wonder if they changed the cook, cuz the uni pieces are getting smaller and smaller EVERY SINGLE TIMso as the salmon, did not taste as fresh. I really hope they will change it soon, or else they will loose a lot of customers."}
{"text":"Been there numerous times and used to be real good. Went back today and somewhat disappointed.   We ordered a large sushi platter - the seafood and egg sushi was tasteless. They used to have a fresh fish/squid/shrimp/egg sweetness. Rice itself would disintegrate into pieces or separate from the seafood upon clamping.  Next was shopping for seafood - their unseasoned West Coast salmon options were limited in choices/quantities. Most of them were seasoned or salted and other generic choices had limited labelling. Ended up finding one small piece of wild caught BC salmon as they sold out.  They used to have seafood curry which was to die for, but seems like the menu has changed a bit and looks different now. Hopefully it's still there and things will improve for the better again!"}
{"text":"Urgh. Asked for 15 pieces of salmon sashimi (while pointing to a slab of salmon in the display case), which they somehow misheard as salmon sushi. Waited for 15 minutes before they presented me with the sushi, which I then clarified was not what I ordered. Waited another 10 minutes while they looked confused, then pointed to the same slab of salmon I had been gesturing to and asked if I wanted it to be sliced. Oh, and waited 5 minutes after asking for ginger...and explaining what ginger is.  By the way, this is what $20 worth of salmon sashimi looks like. It better be the best tasting sashimi I've ever had."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed with the appearance as the demo showed the crabshell but there was only a crab leg when the lunch set delivered to me. Nevertheless, the lunch set came with a bowl of soup and small dish of salad and a plate of rice with seafood.   The soup tastes a bit concentrated, i.e. it's a bit slightly salty to my taste. The salad tastes a bit fishy too. For the plate of rice, there were different kinds of seafood on top of the white rice. The uni, the sea urchins, did taste fresh and delicious although they were small. There were also fish roes and crabmeat with its paste and two slices of eggs on top of the rice. The plate of rice did taste a bit dry, perhaps, other than sea urchins, the eggs, the fish roes and crabmeat are dry.   I will try something else at this place next time. After all, it's not very bad."}
{"text":"Was always looking forward to trying this place, but it wasn't as amazing as I thought it'd be. Yes there's uni and salmon for $12.95, but the salmon slices were pretty thin. Overall portion size is pretty small. Which is fine, but I didn't find the uni or the salmon as fresh as people made it seem. It wasn't bad, but it just...wasn't anything special. My friend ordered the fried tuna?  That was pretty mediocre as well. I don't know, I just don't see myself purposely coming here for my sushi fix."}
{"text":"I got the Hokkaido don ~   ????????The fresh uni, ikura and sashimi with the rice... It's like eating a big ass bowl of sushi goodness!  The fresh seafood here never disappoints! J-Town always has delicious meals, fresh seafood, and amazing service. Not to mention the presentation is always on point!"}
{"text":"*I went on multiple occasions, with the most recent one being the Japanese Summer Festival*  Food 2.5/5 (50% of final grade) The food did not make any particular impression, tbh. Not much to be said-- it wasn't bad, but wasn't good either, and it's not food I can think of eating on any one specific occasion, nor food I think I'll crave.  Ambiance 2.5/5 (15% of final grade) It's a quiet strip mall that's very underwhelming to be called J-Town ... So I evaluate it as a typical Japanese supermarket. If I had to evaluate the entire strip mall as some sort of cultural town, it would get a 1.5/5 lol.   Service 3.5/5 (15% of final grade) The cashier lady (at the food-court-like formatted establishment attached to the meat shop) was very friendly. She answered all my questions about the food, and patiently waited when I had to go back to grab some other stuff and exchange the strawberry mochi for a red bean one. Her friendliness was refreshing and pleasantly surprising in an east-Asian supermarket.   Cost 2/5 (10% of final grade) I could easily find the same products at T&T for a lower price.   Brownie Points 0/5 (10% of final grade) Nothing about the place made enough of an impression for me to give brownie points...  Final Grade = 47/100 = 2 Stars  TLDR: Prepare to be underwhelmed by its deceptive name of \"J-Town\". It's simply a strip mall with a salon, a comic book store, a caf√©, a bakery, and a supermarket, all small in size. While its image is only slightly negative, I can't really see myself going back here again-- I can get everything from T&T, except the haircuts (which I can get elsewhere, too).  P.S. Still unsure why they call it \"J-Town By The Sea\"... It's not near any body of water, and too far from the lake to be \"by the lake\" as well..."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. I love Japanese curry and I ordered Lunch Special #5 (Curry Atlantic Cod) and the curry tasted great.  Nice and spicy. They serve lots of different lunch specials every day so there is a lot of variety.   They also have a big selection of sashimi grade fish that you don't often find in run of the mill Japanese restaurants. Fresh Uni, Toro and Kanpachi are some of the ones I have tried and they have all been excellent and very fresh, especially the Boston Uni......mmmmm uni.  They have a  section that sells other japanese cooking supplies and goods too.  Like the rest of the restaurants and shops at J-Town, I love this place."}
{"text":"I've ordered the uni , crab meat rice to go, it was combo #6  last Friday March 16 around 1:30 pm . I was going to eat at the salon.  As soon as I got there I opened the lid it smelled really bad . I thought maybe I was wrong , as soon as I took a bite , the uni was gross and disgusting . It wasn't fresh at all and I threw up right away. Not sure if I would get food poisoning from this take out. I wish they didn't sell me the rotten uni rice. It was the most disgusting thing ever. It's not even a star worth."}
{"text":"The lunch chirashi special is okay but the rice isn't seasoned so it feels incomplete. Food is only 3 stars.   I purchased both the Vancouver and Boston uni. Both fresh and worth $25. This was the reason for my four star rating."}
{"text":"It was pretty decent, but not sure that I'd return.   Ordered  the Hokkaido Don. It did taste good, but I was still quite hungry after. I know that Japanese food is generally smaller quantity, but I expected a little more for the price given how casual this place is.   Also tried some of my wife's curry. It was okay, but I've had better elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been back several times since my last review and I just have to say the quality of fish has been on a steady decline. I usually order the Hokkaido don and the slices of salmon were super thin. It made me wonder if they were cutting back on costs. The uni salmon and salmon roe were just not as fresh as I had remembered. Another time I had bought the prepackaged sushi and this was the worst sushi I've ever eaten. The rice was hard and falling apart and the fish was sooo fishy it made me gag. I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Got the 8 piece sushi set and 3 onigiri (yellowtail, mackerel, and tuna). The onigiris were really average. One of my onigiris fell apart because the rice was too dry. If you want a better quality onigiri, just step to the grocery store next door and grab one.   The sushi set was average too. I expected the fish quality to be consistent throughout since this was a fish market first. In my opinion, only the fish roe/sea urchin roll was on point. The other rolls did not taste that fresh and again, the rice was not great. My recommendation? Go to Taro's Fish instead."}
{"text":"It was a nice little food court spot. It wasn't the best seafood in my honest opinion but it wasn't terrible.   I got a seafood bowl with rice, uni, crab to name a few. It also came with a miso soup which tasted nice! Its a small little food court with self serve water dispenser. The plate itself was 13 dollars."}
{"text":"The only place I will buy sashimi grade raw fish from. I've never ordered food from here, but I've bought toro, uni and other types of raw fish many times. They are very patient if you want to ask about the types of fish. If you want a smaller piece than what they have pre-cut, they are usually accommodating enough to cut you a smaller piece. If you're buying the raw fish, they'll also ask if you want them to slice it into sashimi pieces for you. They have many different types of uni too, from Boston or Japan. I've been here to buy raw fish to make my own sushi at home and it's amazing.   Just remember that they only have toro on the weekends because there's not enough demand on the weekdays. You can also go next door to the Jtown grocery store to stock up on yummy Japanese snacks!"}
{"text":"I stopped by J-Town to grab dinner just  before 6pm on a Friday night and there was nothing left except the case of Boston uni and a spicy tuna roll. Grabbed them from the fridge and ordered the Hokkaido Don combo to go. The set combos are made fresh and ready in about 5-7 mins.  *4 stars* goes to the Hokkaido Don, which was actually quite impressive. Generous toppings of Uni, ikura and salmon. The v rice was soft and warm! The Boston uni was fresh has a sweeter after taste compared to the Vancouver uni.  However, the spicy tuna roll was nothing to write home about.  I love going to this place whenever I'm the only one  craving for raw fish. No fuss!"}
{"text":"The food here is soooo good! Especially the katsudon and curry, everything is seasoned perfectly and so comforting. The seating here is kind of like cafeteria style, you pay first and wait for your food.   Price is higher than usual but it's authentic Japanese food. Makes me miss Japan!"}
{"text":"I have always walked the markets of j-town but never tried having the food there.  Today was a good time to try lunch since I wasn't in a rush, they have a list of lunch specials and a sample of how they look like.  They all look so good!!   I picked the hokkaido Don (12.80) whereas my boyfriend picked the unagi Don (11.80).  We ate at the small sitting area next to the cashier, and they brought the food to us.    The service is very nice and friendly.  Both bowls were presented very nicely with a piece of fried okra, and a couple of Ontario grow muscat grapes!!! And a bowl of miso soup.    The uni, ikura, and salmon was very fresh.  Uni was nice and creamy and went very well with the rice.   The unagi Don had many pieces along with some ikura, and cucumbers.  The mix of unagi and rice had this perfect sweetness, and the price was so reasonable for such fresh quality ingredients!!   Will definitely come back to try other lunch specials!!"}
{"text":"Had the hakkaido don - looked great on display but fell short of expectations. Wasn't as fresh as I was expecting and everything was just very average when it came to taste. Really wanted to like it but my favourite part of the meal was the soup. Will not be coming back again - for the same price, there are better."}
{"text":"Had the unagi don today. While I have to say that the rice and the various accompaniments were fresh, and they hadn't been sitting there for very long (the unagi don was pre-packaged, and when I got it, the rice was still just barely warm), I can't give it any more stars because it just doesn't wow me in terms of price to portion and quality. It costed $8.99, and it was large enough for a light lunch or good sized snack.   There's a part of me that wants to say that there wasn't enough unagi in my bowl to call it a unagi don. There was one piece of unagi in my bowl, and it was about the size of a half-full individual pack of Kleenex (the kind you carry in your bag). The rest of the toppings (of which there were plenty) were some broccoli, cucumber, carrot, and tomato slices, a cube of pumpkin (this was incredibly sweet and delicious), what tasted like some shredded radish and tofu pocket stewed in bonito (smoked fish) and soy sauce, and a bit of wakame (seaweed) salad. The rice was quite good. The unagi was fatty and tender and delicious. I really do wish there was more of it.  This unagi don was alright, but I've had better elsewhere (I miss you, Sakana-ya)."}
{"text":"Food was great and fish is really fresh.  When I'm not feeling well, I love getting their fish broth. It's not fish at all, they have tomatoes and other veggies in it.   One bad thing is I got the Chirashi and I can't share it with my friend, since he has certain allergies to certain fish. Unless having it at a restaurant you must be sure u don't have allergies to any fish cause everything is pre-made except for the cooked food.   I like how other than sushi they also have various types of fish you can purchase and make dishes with it."}
{"text":"I always thought this restaurant is the food court in J-town supermarket, and I even had lunch yesterday at food court. It was a bit disappointing. Then I was shopping around and found out there's an other restaurant right beside the market, and this is actually the one I wanted to try! So... here I am today. We had #2 Atlantic cod and #6 Unagi barachirashi today. They were both super delicious and the fish were very fresh. #2 has big portion though. Each order has one soup and one side dish. They were surprisingly good too!"}
{"text":"This is only a review on takeout orders from J-Town by the Sea. So far I have tried their Dynamite roll with salad, Unagi Bara Chirashi, Pork katsu don and sashimi & sushi platter. Their dynamite rolls are ok - falls apart quite easily, HUGE pieces, and tastes decent. The unagi bara chirashi is delicious and I pretty much get that most of the time. Sashimi & sushi platter is good because their sashimi tastes fresh! Pork katsu don is way too salty for my taste. The lunch sets usually comes with mochi, but now sometimes it comes with small containers of octopus salad or eggplant instead of the dessert. The salads are good but I want the mochi balls back!!!  The tiramisu mochi is pure love!!! All in all, I recommend this place for its sashimi and chirashi dons!! Their cooked food are just OK."}
{"text":"This tiny little spot seems dingy and sketchy on the outside, but then you walk inside, eat the food and it's even worse.  I got the Hokkaido Don and was thoroughly disappointed.  The uni pieces were super tiny and scarce. There were only 3 thin slices of salmon, accompanied by a few spoonfuls of extra slimy ikura, all atop a bowl of bland, mushy, overcooked rice. The miso soup was also very strange, it had really brown kelp and carrots in it. Everything just seemed like it had been sitting around for a long time.   I wanted to wash the taste of the dish out of my mouth with ice cream mochi but it was so badly freezer burned that it was pretty much inedible.   Protip: Do not get the ice cream mochi. Those things should have been thrown out 5 years+ ago.  Maybe it was the lighting, but everything (displays) looked really cluttered and unappealing. Thought I could find a good fish market closer to where I live, but J-Town By The Sea is definitely not it."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch twice here. Fish is definitely tasty and fresh here but disappointed in their inconsistent quality control and method of handling situations when I identified an issue regarding the food to the cashiers. When I ordered their Hokkaido Don the first time, it was AMA-zing. So satisfying. I ordered the same thing weeks later and was shocked by the taste of the uni - the colour was off... dark yellow almost brown; I took one bite and it tasted stale/rancid. Just completely off and I love uni. I brought this up to the cashier, and all they did was say \"oh it's not fresh?\", took away the uni and that was it. They didn't even bother replace the uni or apologize. Didn't order anything raw from them again. Just simply disappointed with the food and how the situation was handled.   Only came back to buy from their bakery or for their curry in their other food court."}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I only tried the prepared food here, and I didn't buy any raw seafood from them.  Put simply, the bowl came out piping hot, with abundant beautiful pieces of cod lining the bowl. The flavor was just right - that savory and sweet combination that you find at Japanese places. Not too overwhelming and not too understated. The sushi rice was nice and fluffy, absorbing some of the sauce and flavor. I was also pleasantly surprised that it came with miso soup and a side of small pickled salad.  The takoyaki wasn't that good, though. Although it was supposed to be made to order, it came out lukewarm, and I didn't feel like the dough enveloping the octopus was up to snuff.  There's a utensil and water station on the side, which I found very helpful and practical.  Overall, would try lunch here again."}
{"text":"Everything is always so fresh and delicious. Casual Japanese restaurant/market that is similar to food court dining.  Dishes are on the smaller side so good option for a light meal."}
{"text":"So we have the whole J Town complex in general and individual places on Yelp...  I didn't end up having lunch here, but I purchased some of the food products available in the fridges. There is a large amount of variety available, especially considering the small size of this place. They also have a sushi/sashimi selection on the other side of the store, and the selection looked very impressive (bluefin tuna, toro, etc).   There is also a large seating area that's mainly for people who ordered lunch or just want some free cold water available, but I've also seen people coming from Tora Sushi to sit here, because it gets...kinda lonely in that sushi place.  As for the taste of what I bought? Well, I don't know yet; haven't eaten them yet. I'm quite confident it'll be tasty though! If not, I'll update this review accordingly.  Next time I'll definitely try the lunch specials. No question about it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming to J-Town. They have the best priced sushi and anything Japanese.   I came here for lunch with a friend and got the Sapporo Don. Can't say I'm a fan of the uni, but everything else was delicious. The lunch came with a small portion of potato salad, two small pieces of mochi, and miso soup.   Price is a tad bit on the expensive end.... But then again, you're getting uni and crab so it's more or less worth it.   Definitely going to come back again and try what else they offer for lunch!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places to eat. A hidden little gem inside j town with different daily specials. The portions are very generous for its price and the quality is amazing! I love how all the food is authentic and prepared with care. The soup that comes with the dishes are so homey and delish!   There's also a few freezers where you can pick up some seafood for a very reasonable price. There's also small quantity goods such as premium soy sauce, green tea, sake, sushi, etc."}
{"text":"For lunch this is not a bad place if you want some acceptable and affordable seafood in Japanese style. Service is casual, expect a casual lunch.   As for buying take out, the quality seems to have decreased when it changed hands to some other owner a couple years ago. I stopped buying sushi from then since. I might update the review after I try their sushi again."}
{"text":"Will definitely come back for more Sashimi and Hokkaido Don = ^ 0 ^ =  The taste of Dine- in order is excellent, but just like any authentic Japanese cuisine, the portion is more delicate and petite (compared to North American food).  But yes! this is definitely the place when you want to pamper yourself with a variety of sashimi, especially Uni (Sea Urchin) and fresh fish. They also see frozen ika (squid) and different kinds of pre-cut sashimi.  The pre-packaged sushi could be in the fridge for few hours...but the chef of the handcraft Nigirizushi (hand- pressed sushi) is quite professional. It's still good, but I might have too much expectation after watching some authentic sushi making YouTubes....XD Just wish I could try some that are made-to- order next time.   The fried food is okay...they don't have the special soy-sauce for Tempura =("}
{"text":"I did not like this place at all. The place seems to be dirty. I really hope the owner takes note and correct this problem. The food was not good at all. While preparing the shushi the rice was been taking out of a plastic bag"}
{"text":"I had a Sapporo Don lunch special ($13.8) - it came with a small snow crab leg, Extra crab meat, uni, fish roe. A soup and salad were included in the combo. The quality and freshness of the seafood was just okay; the snow crab meat was frozen, I believed, and made the rice very watery.   The service was friendly and meal came quickly.   I may come back for other lunch combo but not the Sapporo Don."}
{"text":"Small portion, and quite expensive for what it is. This place sells a lot of hard to find japanese food and ingredients. Staff is really friendly. Can het busy durinf lunch time. If you post and tag them on instagram you get a free mochi."}
{"text":"Love this place. Have been coming here for lunch regularly for about a year. Authentic Japanese, no frills and friendly service. Great value. Free citrus water as well!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in Toronto. Beautiful, fresh fish, great service. Real Japanese family who runs the place. I would give higher ratings if I could. This is not luxury it's a very simple place with incredible food. Stand outs today were Vancouver uni, almost as good as Tokyo, beautiful grade A toro (fatty tuna) and the most delicate dynamite roll I've ever tasted.   I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"A place I have always been dreaming of!   J-Town By The Sea will probably be my to go place for anything Japanese and fresh from the sea! This place is just like a mini fish market in Japan!  Lunch Special with a choice of 7 items till 2pm if you want a taste of well prepared cooked seafood or Sashimi.   Kaisen Don ($10.80) was so so good. Nothing fancy but have this homey feel or something prepared with care! A mixture of cooked and raw seafood of what is fresh and available.  There are also uni, eel and even exotic fish from Japan. Fresh or frozen seafood....Sashimi heaven!  There is an small eat in area and you can eat from real  bowl!  I will be back! A grilled whole sea bream!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest. We live in Toronto. We are not near any ocean. We are in close proximity to Lake Ontario and Lake Erie (238 km). Our marine life is comprised of yellow perch, smelt, lake trout, bass and white fish. With this knowledge at hand, I have realistic expectations on sashimi available in Toronto. Seafood traveled a long way to arrive at our lovely city.   I have always been a fan of J-Town By the Sea for as long as I remember. We often come by to pick up sashimi for key milestones: birthdays, graduations and career changes. The owner is always very kind.   The seafood at J-Town By the Sea never disappoints; blue fin tuna toro, hamachi, sweet shrimp, uni, sockeye salmon, mockfish liver, sword fish, to name a few. You can find a good variety of Sashimi. Prices varies by weight. Ice is offered for Sashimi takeout.   On a day I when want to treat myself, I will come by for chirashi don ($13.80) or an 8 piece sushi set ($13.80). Although the rice tastes like it has been refrigerated (which it has been), it is an ocean party in your mouth!   Pro tip: Free mochi, If you post a picture of them on Instagram."}
{"text":"Can't seem to stay away from this place! I've been frequenting Jtown almost once a week for the past month or two because I can't get enough of their sushi/sashimi. Their fish is consistently fresh and I can't get enough of their \"Special Sushi\" (four small pieces of nigiri sushi usually made with premium ingredients such as uni, roe, or toro) that they only come out with on the weekends.   For uni lovers, their East meets West Uni sushi ($16.80) is a contrast of two different types of uni - Boston on one side and Vancouver on the other side of the nigiri. Another favorite is the the Sushi Supreme ($13.80) with a mix of toro, ikura, uni and tobiko. But my absolute favorite so far is the uni-roe ($13.80) because the combination of those two flavors is mind blowing.   If eating in, I would recommend getting one of their 10 set meals which comes with a side of soup and veggies and is available throughout the week. You order at the counter and when the meal is ready, the girls will call out the number on written on the receipt and bring the bring the food out to you. I personally would recommend the Hokkaido don ($12.80) with fresh salmon, uni, ikura and tamago on a bed of sesame rice. The Otaru Kaisen Don ($14.80) is good too but is missing the game changing uni.   Aesthetically, place is very humble and it looks more like a cafeteria. But the food is good, the place is clean and the people there are very nice and helpful... And that's what really matters. I left my phone there once and the girls kept it safe until I returned.   On days that I don't have much time, I love that I can pop in here to pick up all the fresh ingredients I need to make my own Japanese meals at home. One of the things I miss most about Hokkaido Japan is their amazing kaisendon filled with ikura and uni. But at Jtown, I can get my own little taste of Japan by picking up one of their uni platters ($30.80) and pair it off with some roe, some sushi rice and voila - the ultimate kaisendon."}
