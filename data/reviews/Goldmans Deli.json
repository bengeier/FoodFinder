{"text":"Best Rueben I've had in a while and the potato salad was awesome too. Very friendly staff and reasonable prices made for an awesome visit. Definitely worth a return trip."}
{"text":"i really miss living a few blocks away from this place.  its great.  fresh product prepared well.  nice family owned joint.  the owners are a nice group as well.  i always tried to get something different everytime i went in and never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Our entire family has been going here for years, since right after they opened the first little store with like 6 tables. The owner's family is so sweet and the food is phenomenal - the soups alone are to die for. Cannot recommend this place enough if you're looking for a real Jewish deli. Wish we still lived close, would be there weekly."}
{"text":"Good Eggs Benedict, actually the best I have had in the Scottsdale area. Service on the other end, very poor. The orders at the time of service, March 10th around 1:30 pm were very slow and the employees were very rude. I would not say I am a regular but I try to make it out there twice a month, but I was treated very poorly. For example, we bought two drinks and we filled up with two sodas. While sitting at the table the cashier came up and said I charged you for a water and soda, \"I need two dollars for you\" (In a tone I am unable to duplicate). I understand business is business and every dollar counts, however I disagree with her approach to it. I gave her the two dollars and walked out leaving our meals untouched. Goldman's lost my patronage over the disrespect and dirty looks from their cashier."}
{"text":"I decided to treat myself to a \"normal\" sandwich from Goldman's today. I ordered the pastrami on rye with lettuce, tomato, mayo and mustard ( well almost normal). And since this time I was not in sticker shock I could not help but to order a black and white cookie too. The pastrami was very tasty, but it was a bit too dry for me. The slaw helped and the cookie made for a good contrast between the saltiness of the pastrami and the slightly spicy mustard. I think I still prefer the beef tongue, but all in all still a good meal."}
{"text":"I love Goldman's.  I go there often, mainly for the soup.  Love all the soups, but my favorites are the Lima Bean and Navy Bean.  Cabbage soup is exceptional too.   Chompies Cabbage soup has a bitter taste.  No comparison. Enjoy the Jerusalem Salad as well. Chicken is always really tender. Healthy meal choice.   Patty melt is great but expensive.  Reuben is good. The whole family works there and they work very hard."}
{"text":"Excellent Jewish Deli...reminds me of breakfast in Chicago or New York. PASTRAMI and also the corned beef hash are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Gotta love a place with a clean bathroom and purse hooks.   Besides the food is pretty good.  A little pricey for lunch but we are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I got the club sandwich and my Mom got the chicken salad sandwich.  I felt like I was eating cardboard.  They had absolutely zero flavor to them the bread was terrible.  I would recommend either making your own sandwich or going to Subway because they would both taste better than this place."}
{"text":"This is my first visit. Had the Pastrami. Very good. Not as big as Chompi's.  This is not a kosher deli. They make their own brisket but I haven't tried it yet.  The Pastrami was on fresh rye. Quality was high. Price is too--$9.50 for a whole sammy. You get about 8 ounces of meat on the sammy.  I'll be back to try other menu items. Looks like many Yelpers like the soup's.  I would like to see more food and meats displayed for take home like at Chompi's.  I take off points for pricing....just a little bit high on the value side.  Service was prompt and friendly. I like the place. Pretty basic ambiance."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from the outside, but I've had the pastrami sandwich  on a roll a few times and it always hits the spot. I can only eat half, so I save the rest for later.  I'm pretty sure these people really know what they're doing, so probably anything you try here will be good."}
{"text":"I stopped here on a whim and ordered a pastrami on rye.   The bread was chewy and the potato salad had little flavor.  It would have been fine e for a $7 meal, but I paid $15 for it. I won't be putting this place on my itinerary again."}
{"text":"Traveled in from the east coast so I got to Arizona very early in the day.  I needed to kill some time before I could check into my hotel room so I ended up stopping at Goldman's.  What a pleasant, authentic place. I had the spinach and feta omelette. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"U Gotta like this place. Soups - matzo ball, kreplach, cabbage, borscht - all top notch.  Love the chopped liver, Kasha Varnishkes. Sandwiches all well done."}
{"text":"The deli itself is good, and the chicken salad is great, but the price tag is a bit much for a local place. It's always a shock to get a $25 charge on three things at a deli..."}
{"text":"We saw Goldmans Deli when we went to Albertson's one night, so we decided to try it for lunch today.  Ordered the Turkey Club with wheat bread, and it was delicious!! 4 huge slices filled with turkey, tomato, romaine salad, kosher bacon. It came with a side of french fries and that was yummy. For the sandwiches, you get a choice between coleslaw, potato salad, chips or french fries.   It was a little pricey for sandwich, it was $9.99 but it was delicious & worth it! It's hidden in the Albertson's plaza all the way on the right side.   Also, if you order under $5 and charge to a credit card there is a small fee of $0.35."}
{"text":"We randomly stopped in here when we were up in Scottsdale and we were not disappointed. The prices seem high when ordering sandwiches but the portions are HUGE and they do not skimp on the meat in the sandwiches. A great authentic Jewish deli that we will defiantly go back to!"}
{"text":"Goldman's Deli makes the best Matzo Ball soup and their challah bread is delicious!  I'm a huge fan!  They are also open in the evenings, everyday!"}
{"text":"Very good and friendly place everything fresh Pastrami very good. Great spoke for Deli food"}
{"text":"Want to have Jewish deli this is legit. When they are really busy the service is not the greatest but the food is always amazing."}
{"text":"I worked here for 3 weeks and quit because the boss was verbally abusive towards the staff. I got called stupid and immature and yelled at multiple times a day. I also saw her yell at customers and call them liars when they complained about their food. I was told to lie to customers that the food was homemade when it was bought. I was paid minimum wage and was told I would be fired if I took any tips that were given to me PERSONALLY. The owner kept all the tips which there were a lot of. She should be sued for this it's really unfair to everyone who works so hard at the front of the restaurant. The food is overpriced and subpar. It's a Jewish deli but they have no kosher food! If you go here DON'T TIP. Your not helping your server, your helping the owner steal all their money! And complain and see how you get treated after that!"}
{"text":"Yummy!  We would go to Canter's in LA before I moved out here so this is a good comparable Pastrami Sandwich.  Very close to where we live which is great.  Prices are fine, a bit pricey, but oh well.  Overall, thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I was served a 5 day old pumpernickel bagel with a small amount of cream cheese for $2.99. Brought it back to my office and was barely able to bite through it. Not very friendly counter service to begin with either.  Clean the place once in a while, too.     Not going back for breakfast.  Will go to lox stock and bagel down the road.  Maybe I'll try the soup sometime!"}
{"text":"I enjoy a good deli but man is it steep at Goldman's.  The sandwiches were delicious but for 2 deli sandwiches to go wit chips was $24.00...OMG love having a good sandwich but not sure it was worth it.  :("}
{"text":"Best deli ever!! Found this gem in Yelp. Split a sandwich with hubby, staff very attentive no problem splitting order. Extensive menu, breakfast, lunch and dinner. Can't wait to try the blintz's."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Located in an unassuming strip mall.  Try the Brisket dip sandwich.  Very good value for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale on business and I fell ill.  This deli was recommended to me for the best soup in town. This is a TRUE deli.   Amazing food, atmosphere is truly NYC throw back. A must-eat-at!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, delicious food. I had the brisket sandwich and it was so tender and  the portion was huge! Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Today I'm having Matzoh ball soup and a half of a pastrami sandwich and like always good service and a good Jewish deli"}
{"text":"Very clean, the floor and tables shine. The owner is a delight to know and talk to. A friendly family fun place to be. Just like mom's. Food is EXCELLENT. Try the lamb!!! Portions are very generous. Frys are perfect.  Fun place with homelike atmosphere, just like being at home. Definitely going back - often."}
{"text":"The Best deli with homestyle meals.  And delicious. The staff is very attentive to the customers."}
{"text":"Awesome deli!    They make great soups and sandwiches with generous portions.  The menu was pretty extensive, with an option to create your own sandwich.    The only (slight) downside to my visit:  They were not speedy.  I had a bit of a wait for my lunch.  I wasn't in a particular hurry and it was really good so, it wasn't a problem.  It gave me a chance to check out the six or so ladies who lunched and then recessed to a cutthroat game of Mahjong.  How cool!    There was no hassle when I asked for substitutions either.  I'll be sure to return."}
{"text":"Probably the best Jewish Deli in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"What a disappointment today! I have been a customer of Goldman's since its'. inception. Prices have gone up and up but I have noticed that service has been dropping since SAM (one of the family) has left. I do not mind paying, but Mrs. Goldman seems more mercenary and less concerned about your satisfaction. Today I ordered a roast beef sandwich, side of cole slaw and a piece of kugel and a Dr Browns soda. There was no one in the restaurant and a full staff. After washing my hands, sitting down at a table, reading the news on my iPhone, watching a couple come n and order and get served, I realized that no one had an idea what the hell I was doing there or that I had ordered and paid. I asked, at first politely, and they all looked up with the stare I most hate signaling, \" Huh? What? Where? They went thataway . I have not a thought in my head.\" Then they went into a mode scrambling to find the order. ( Tough because there were 3 people in the restaurant and I was the only one who did not get ANYTHING!) Then Mrs. Goldman joined in the \"what.\"  group because up until then she was diddling with a fax machine in plain view and did not have time to help me ( only time to take my $17 plus dollars). NO apologies.NO let me take something off the meal! NO , \"Hey let's snap to it and get this gentleman served!!!!!!!\"  I demanded my money back. Mrs. Goldman gave me the $ less the cost of the Dr Browns she opened for me! What is my point, after all, every restaurant has a lousy evening.  True. BUT, it's HOw the situation was handled that tells you that  the owner could care less about you and the service that you get. BAD SIGN!!!!  It tells me that GOLDMAN's is going down and that is too bad. STAY AWAY unless. you like stopping free falls. IF  she does not care about what you see, then what does she not care about in the kitchen?"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Decent portions with spot on service. My wife and I split a turkey club. On the pricey side, but no higher than most Deli restaurants. Good people watching and plenty of parking!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best deli in Scottsdale.  I have been going to Goldmans for years and regardless of which meal, time of day or what I order from their menu, the quality of their food and service is outstanding.  The staff is genuine and friendly in a tidy, welcoming environment."}
{"text":"Okay, after 17 reviews that received either one or five stars, I'm actually writing a two star review (technically, I'd give them 2.5 stars but there's no mechanism for that). I feel it's my duty, being a transplanted east coast Jew, to weigh in on Jew food here in the valley.  First, the positives: the food was pretty good. They didn't put any of those annoying coatings on their fries and when I said \"extra lean\" I got a corned beef sandwich w/o any fat. They also stocked one of my favorite sodas, a deli staple, called Doc Brown's diet black cherry. Yum!  That doesn't sound too bad. So why the 2.5 stars, you ask? Okay, the negatives: the negatives all center around price. I paid $10 for a SMALL sandwich and fries. Now, don't get me wrong, I got enough to eat. But that's not the way a Jewish deli works. Half a sandwich and a side should be enough to eat. It is at every other Jewish deli I've ever been to. That way you can share or save the rest for later. Plus, I asked for an extra pickle. How dare I?! Little did I know when I made the request that they were going to charge me $1 FOR A FREAKIN' PICKLE SPEAR!!! THAT'S LIKE AN EIGHTH OF A PICKLE!!! I couldn't believe it! Add to that the cost of my beloved Doc Brown's $2.49 and I'm quickly going broke. But wait, there's more. I dared to order pastry.  Now, there are several reasons I ordered pastry and none of them are particularly startling. First off, I'm never in a Jewish deli so I couldn't let the opportunity pass. Secondly, I'm a real sucker for apricot pastry and they had two different kinds. Third, they had mandelbrot, which is prominently featured in my novel so I wanted to try theirs and see if it's any better than what I get from Simply Bread (it wasn't). Though I only had nibbles of each of the three small pieces, just to try them, I paid $3.30 for the privilege.  Will I go back there again? Probably not. While the food was okay, I feel like I was mugged. Kinda leaves a bad taste in the mouth. One even good Jew food can't get rid of."}
{"text":"First time here.  Place was very clean and the man behind the counter was very welcoming.  We ordered Matzoh ball soup and the soup for Tuesday which was split pea.  Ordered the chicken liver appetizer and a corned beef on rye sandwich which came with fries (other choices were available).  We paid an extra dollar to get extra lean corned beef.   We sat at the comfy booth and they brought the food to us, soups first.  Hubby liked the matzoh ball soup.  I tasted the broth and then the matzoh ball (it was a huge one).  I was hoping that it would be better than my own soup so I wouldn't have to make it so often (it is work!).  And while it was not better than my own, hubby thought it was very good.   The split pea soup, which had some tiny square noodles in it, was delicious.  I got a toasted wheat bagel with the soup.  The corned beef sandwich was a nice size and the meat was super lean and not salty.  The fries that came with it were just ok, but not bad.  It is rare that frozen fries are really good.   But the star of the show was my chopped chicken liver appetizer.  A delicious scoop of the most godly, amazing, fresh, well-balanced chopped chicken livers.  OMG.  I thought I would scrape the plate clean.  Licking the plate in public is gauche so I refrained.  But whoever made this beautiful batch of chopped chicken livers has golden hands and the best of recipes.    This was the first time here and I can't think of why we didn't find this place sooner."}
{"text":"The soups get FIVE stars.  Everything else gets just THREE stars.  Ergo, I ended up with FOUR stars.  The soups are amazing.  The navy bean has a wonderful flavor that I don't think can be duplicated.  Try the navy bean soup.  It will turn you into a \"Navy-Bean-Soup-Zombie\".  You'll walk around like Frankenstien with your hands up in the air with a glossed look over your face mumbling \"ERRRRR Navy Bean Soup.... ERRRR\".  You'll sleepwalk the same way and may end up walking down to Hayden and Indian Bend.   \"ERRRR Navy Bean Soup... ERRRR\""}
{"text":"I'm from Brooklyn.  I've dined at the famous New York City delis, such as 2nd Avenue Deli, Stage Deli, Carnegie, plus many in local neighborhoods and the New York and New Jersey suburbs. In addition, I've been to Nate 'N Al in Beverly HIlls, CA, and even Chompies in Phoenix.  There is no way that Goldmans compares to the best of these, or even the worst.  So on our first and last visit to Goldmans:  My Turkey Pastrami sandwich was salty, the potato salad was bland, what little there was of it, and they couldn't manage more than a quarter pickle. What about the plate full of pickles other goodies that that you get at a real deli? My wife's chicken caesar salad had tough croutons, salty chicken, and Goldmans couldn't spare more than a couple of hard pieces of rye bread as a special request. Give me a break! This is not a real Jewish deli. It doesn't come close.  Unless something has changed drastically since those other reviews were written, I question their perspective. Sure, people are entitled to their opinions, but this is absurd."}
{"text":"It's a cute little place, it looks smaller than it really is. The front looks like a typically deli, selling  breakfast, sandwiches (cold and hot) and deli meats! The front has a couple tables, but walking down inside, there's a fairly big area with cushy booths! The service was great! I got a pastrami sandwich, boyfriend got corned beef. Corned beef was good, but a little dry, portions are seriously huge. Pastrami was fairly phenomenal! Meal comes with choice of fries, chips or coleslaw. Coffee there was great too! The service is you order, bring the number to your table and then there's table service. Great with checking up and refilling coffee (such a huge plus)"}
{"text":"Called for a take out order.  Got the pastrami on rye with Swiss.  They had the order ready when I arrrived and I also picked up some chocolate rugelach cookies.   The sand which was an amazing thing.  Melt in your mouth pastrami.  The bread was fresh and perfect and there was a big slice of Melted Swiss!!   The cookies were also in a class by themselves.   Flaky and chocolatey in the best way.  I will eat here many more times to come"}
{"text":"Awesome family-owned place. High quality, homemade food and friendly service. Great sandwiches and fresh deli."}
{"text":"Ordered a combination of pastrami and corn beef sandwiches. The food was great, and far bore better then Chompies. My only complaint was a lack of creativity with the fries. However.....who goes to a deli for fries? Their pastrami was the best in town!"}
{"text":"Really excellent food! Great service. Matzo ball soup and brisket sandwich are both excellent."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic! The food was very good, I wish I had a picture but ate everything first lol!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It has been nearly three years since my last sandwich was consumed at this location. The pastrami turned out better than that meal, but it is far from the best pastrami in the area. The meat was lean (add a buck) and hot, but not crumbly like top quality pastrami at Nocawich. They say it's made in-house, but I'm not totally convinced. Regardless, the sandwich ($12) had good rye bread and comes with choice of side (cole slaw was ok) and a pickle.    The whole thing is that nothing that comes from Chicago is as good as what comes from NY, pastrami included. Chompie's is an overall better choice and do not order the turkey at Goldman's, which is just deli sliced stuff (a big No No for a top deli). Chicago will never be NY and the food is proof."}
{"text":"What a jewel!  Delicious Reuben & potato salad - we'll go again & often.  Recommended to us by NY deli connoisseurs."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great breakfast, great sandwiches, and I love the sweet cabbage soup. Huge club sandwich!"}
{"text":"This is about the fourth visit to Goldmans and although a lot of people rave about it, I don't think it's as good as Chompies. I had the pastrami sandwich on this visit, and although it was good, it simply doesn't have the flavor that Chompies has.  That being said, it's still a good choice for a big deli sandwich, and a good value when considering the size of the sandwiches. Their breads are very fresh, and portions huge, but still, not as tasty as Chompies...."}
{"text":"First time, last time. Very small portIons. Must be a salmon shortage. Tomato, capers, lox, onion, and cream cheese all on a bagel and was still smaller than a White Castle Slider.   As The Donald would say:  Sad, so sad.   Still thinking about that sandwich. Reviewers consider this a \"Jewish Deli\". NOT. a Jewish mother would be embarrassed at the size of that pitzel sandwich. Anyone that has been to a Jewish Deli in NY, CHI, LA, MIAMI,raves about the size of the huge overstuffed sandwiches. But wait, all is not lost. There is a True Jewish Deli in Scottsdale. I'm not going to name names, but they have several locations. When I leave this unnamed deli I have to be wheeled out I am so full! Like I said:  first time, last time.  Pepper T. Left a picture of what her Nova Lox looked like. Mine looked nothing like that. Looks like she got 3X the amount of lox I received. Maybe the owner didn't like the way I looked and decided to be a goniff and not give me a quality sandwich. I'm going to tell my mishpucha about the pitzel sandwich and how I was taken advantage of."}
{"text":"Loved our first visit! The food and staff were amazing! Cannot say enough...you must try it for yourself!  Thank you to Rozalia and her Husband for being so wonderful!"}
{"text":"I grew up on Long Island, mecca of the Jewish delis. Goldmans can keep up with the best.  Most times like tonight I'm here for the delicious homemade soup, but I've tried plenty of their lunch options also.  The chicken noodle soup I'm hoping can be part of my cure for what seems like a pretty bad cold coming on - I'll keep you posted. The chicken salad and tuna salad platters are fresh and delicious.  I highly recommend them. The nova lox - my personal favorite -- is so good.  I've taken this home plenty of times and munched on it through the day.   The rugulas are the real deal.  I always get the double-chocolate, it is exactly how it is suppossed to taste - buttery, flaky but thick, not to sweet, and full of flavor.  If you've never had one, think of a croissant but smaller in size, and thicker in dough texture.  They are not a typical cookie.   Goldmans is great --- even better --- they're open til 8pm!!! How exciting you can drop by for dinner too!!!  Try Goldmans out. Prices are a bit higher than a typical sandwich shop, but so is the quality.  Worth a few extra dollars and a few extra minutes, trust me."}
{"text":"Great pastrami sandwich and hot dog. But for that and a coke it was $17.50. Paying the extra $1.00 for extra lean pastrami was definitely worth it, but the first $9.49 for the average-sized sandwich was too much. It's close to my new office, so I'd go all the time if the price was right. Memo to Goldman's: you are a NY-style deli, not NY-based!!  Definitely try it and if you're loaded go on a regular basis."}
{"text":"They have great hot dogs and drinks. The service there is great, and the drinks aren`t what they seem. I once went there to get grape juice, not very exited (plain old grape juice) -  I tried it and it tasted like grape soda! I beg you to go to Goldmans Deli."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the egg salad one day, Matzo ball soup another day and finally the chicken salad.  So I would say Yep I am a fan!  The owners are so friendly, the place is clean and the food taste great. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"So we rode our bikes to this area and it was the only place open that serves beer(friends request).  It wasn't horrible but I could've gone to the Albertson's next door and gotten a much better wrap.  My husbands mushroom omelette looked nasty.  A friends corned beef hash wasn't bad.  I wouldn't make a special trip there, but at the same time I wouldn't eat there again.    My rating would be summed up with one word: ...Meh..."}
{"text":"Hello, my name is Josie and I'm a deli-holic.  I. Love. Goldman's. This review is an update, it's been about two years since I first discovered Goldman's Deli. I was hesitant to jump on the Goldman's bandwagon at first, thankfully, things have changed. I eat at Goldman's about once a week.   There are three major things that make Goldman's wonderful:  1. They are family owned and operated, Mrs. Goldman is so sweet, she recognizes her regular patrons and knows them by name. The staff is always helpful and friendly.  2. The food is fantastic and fresh 3. It is always impeccably clean   Their soup is amazing, it's always so difficult to choose just one (I strongly suggest the matzo ball, or sweet and sour cabbage!) I know that people love their Borscht. Their sandwiches are to die for, I'm obsessed with their turkey pastrami, boyfriend loves their Ruben's. Their baked goods are delicious, take home a multi-pack of their Rugulach. I usually get the same thing when I go to Goldman's, half a  turkey pastrami sandwich on rye, with a cup of soup (even though I always want to get a bowl.) I always leave happy and full and so will you.   The only reason I won't give Goldman's five stars is because their prices are quite high (not unusual for a deli restaurant) and the portions are not as large as most deli's, therefore, I don't think that the prices are reasonable. Also, they will nickel and dime you over small things (like charging for pickles) or charging for butter.  Also, they don't make their own pickles...even Chompie's (gross) makes their own pickles! But, I can forgive Goldman's for their high prices and pathetic pickles. I suggest this place to everyone that will listen. I feel like a deli pusher.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place but I just couldn't. I ordered a big bowl of matzoh ball soup for lunch and it can only be described as SALTY! The matzoh ball was big and fluffy but I couldn't get past the super salty broth. My buddy got a corned beef sandwich which he said was fatty and just average. I'll give them the befit and try it again, our third friend that ate with us swears by Goldman's."}
{"text":"Decent solid deli. Pay at the counter they bring the food out. Full menu of deli food from chopped liver to matzo ball soup to big Sandwiches and bagels. Order a big. Owl of soup - was hot with 2 huge matzoballs.  Coming back tomorrow morning for lunch. Can't wait for Vienna kosher Salami Sandwich or maybe pastrami."}
{"text":"Had dinner there Friday night and it was wonderful. This was my first time there. The matzoh ball soup was just like my mother made, as well as the chopped liver. Pastrami sandwich was over stuffed and was great the next day."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!  Pastrami on rye is wonderful.  Or better yet order the \"hash addict\" as we called it - corn beef hash, poached eggs topped with hollandaise for breakfast.   Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were hanging around Scottsdale for the day and I pulled this place up on yelp. The reviews made it sound like a good choice for dinner so we stopped by.   It was surprising that at 6PM on a Saturday night, we were the only ones there. I wasn't overly impressed with the speed of getting our sandwiches, but maybe there was more prep that went into them than I thought. From the time we ordered it was about 15 minutes until we got our food.   My wife got a grilled salami sandwich. Judging by her \"It's just ok\" reaction when I asked how it was, it wasn't really anything spectacular. I had the pastrami sandwich. Judging by the reviews for this place, I figured that would be a good choice. Maybe it was bad timing (end of the day?) but this was probably the worst pastrami sandwich I've had in a long time. The pastrami was pretty dry and lacked flavor. The bread was a little stale tasting but wasn't horrible.   I doubt I would come back to this place. There are a lot of better options for food in the area. If you're really craving a deli, it's not a bad option, but don't go out of your way just to eat here."}
{"text":"Fun audio snippets overheard from other customers: \"private equity,\" \"When is YOUR next cruise?\" and \"What do you plan to do in Israel?\"  So that gives an idea of the clientele. A nice place to relax.  Okay, the food:  I'm on a mission to find the best pastrami-on-rye  in the Valley.  The pastrami meat here is the best I've tasted.  Clean, flavorful, not salty.  And they pile on just the right amount.    But -- ACK! -- here's the worst thing possible: The sandwich arrived with MAYONNAISE.  Really, I'm not kidding.  (I ordered the sandwich -- specifically -- with lettuce, tomato, onions and mustard.)  This is beyond \"faux pas\" for a Jewish deli, so I have go lower than the \"A-OK\" yelp defines for three stars and go with two.  Otherwise: The pickle was excellent and fresh and did not taste like salt, just good.  The bread the fell apart, a bit too dry and not a lot of \"rye\" flavor.  The red onion slices were about 1/4\" inch thick, at least twice as thick as I prefer."}
{"text":"Awesome deli with a wide variety of breakfast, lunch and dinner. I had the tuna melt. Probably the worst thing on the menu. Tuna served on top of an English muffin with American cheese melted over it. Tuna was good. Just an odd way to serve it. Would have preferred a choice of bread and cheese options."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Friendly staff. I had to get some work done before a business meeting. I needed a delicious sandwich and some space to work. I found both at Goldman's. The staff was very helpful. Great environment."}
{"text":"WOW, how have I never been here before now??  This is one great place.  The food is devine and of the highest quality.  I have never had a beef sandwich be both juicy and tender at the same time.    I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"All I can say is that I have just had the absolute best Lima Bean Soup that I have ever, ever had.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Really Delicious!!!! The staff was friendly and answered our questions and made suggestions as well. The sandwiches and soups were good along with the Hungarian goulash. Service was quick and the place was kept clean. What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I had a craving for deli and this hit the spot!! Deli is certainly comfort food for me - goes right to my soul (and hips!) Definitely a 'home-cooked' taste and feeling to everything- I was sorry that I couldnt eat everything in one sitting. ha ha which means that I will be back for more! I will say that I have had a better knish though. It seems to be a great place for 'take-out' too :)"}
{"text":"Golden super good the soup is fantastic the brisket is super good chicken salad is world class just everything was really good family"}
{"text":"My minimum bar for breakfast places is the ability to turn out a competent Denver omelet, and I have been surprised in the past at the number that cannot. Almost every bagelry that serves egg dishes can't, and a surprising number of other eateries as well. Goldmans Deli is one such, but they have a reason for it -- they're kosher, at least, so I assume. But their Spanish omelet is so good, I'm willing to overlook the omission. (Just don't look for any pork products on the menu.)  Friendly, attentive service and tasty (if a little oilier than I'd normally like, potatoes especially), this is a keeper."}
{"text":"This deli has excellent food. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I love the home made soups and they have a great grilled Kosher hot dog! A lunchtime favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Loved the old school environment too. Had the chicken noodle soup & a roast beef on rye! Outstanding! Going to try their breakfast next!!"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood Jewish deli, the Jerusalem salad and tuna fish salad are two staples in my diet, they show on grub hub that they deliver but when I have called and inquired about the service I'm sad to report they do not, boy would I love me some Goldmans delivery!! (Not so subtle hint, hint!)"}
{"text":"A trip down memory lane, straight to my aunt helen's table. Big portions, tasty food, friendly staff. The best!"}
{"text":"The chicken noodle soup was delicious, The Pastrami sandwich was a little dry....the sides were potato salad or French fry's, So I got two tablespoons of potato salad? Thanks"}
{"text":"I met the owner briefly and she did a lot of research into developing what kind of Delicatessen she wanted to open. The service is casual, you order at the counter and the food get delivered to you. This place looks like a deli. Big Deli case and little not so fancy tables and plenty of tables outside facing the parking lot.  This Delicatessen is Chicago Style with some traditional Jewish items. I've never been to Chicago but I met a friend from Chicago and she said this place serves food just like what she had in Chicago.  I tried a Nova Lox and Cream Cheese on a toasted Bagel. The bagel was the first proper sized bagel I had in Arizona. It didn't have the East Coast Chew to it but hey this is Chicago Style in Arizona. The correct size was enjoyable to eat most bagels here are too big. The sandwich was good and everything in it was fresh.  My husband had the Pastrami on rye. The Rye bread was a good kind of rye and not that boring wimpy tasting Arizona Rye. I did get to taste a piece of the pastrami and it was prepared very carefully and was very succulent and juicy but very mildly seasoned almost but not quite and seemed closer in taste to East Coast Corned Beef. Not my style of pastrami but it was good and very fresh. The potato salad was seasoned nicely.  Service was friendly and helpful.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"The egg salad is like sex.  I love an authentic Jewish deli, complete with Chicago Snowbirds..."}
{"text":"Best Jewish Deli in Scottsdale!  Wonderful family-owned restaurant.  They have great dinners available, in addition to a HUGE menu.  They're also great with special orders.  I like the hot dog, \"charred\" (aka: grilled).  They even do grilled onions at no extra charge.  They have a TON of meat in their sandwiches without it being too much meat.  Good coleslaw, great fries.  Dessert selection is good.  They even make breakfast.  its like a small version of Scott's Generations in Phoenix (which is great), but it's owned and run by the sweetest brother and sister team you could ever meet."}
{"text":"The only thing ive ordered here is a ruben sandwich and it was okay, I guess they have better things than this so I will try something else next time."}
{"text":"Not savvy enough to new the difference between a Chicago and New York style deli, seemed similar to most deli's I've tried.  Solid, if a tad too salty, fare."}
{"text":"Very conflicted about the review. Ordered a corn beef & Chopped liver sandwich. The problem the sandwich was lacking the meat & chopped liver. All you could taste was the bread. A real ripoff. A very poor representation / or disgrace to serve this.  We also ordered the broiled chicken special and it was good.  To many deli's that serve a descent sandwich for the same price....."}
{"text":"Pastrami Sandwich was dry and very average.  Couldn't finish it. Meh.   My friend had a turkey club, which had good size, and tasty bacon. But nothing great.  Fries were Ok.   If you looking for a hearty lunch, I would try a different option than I did.   -Cheers"}
{"text":"Goldmans deli is very clean ,with good prices and friendly service, my favorite is the mile high corned beef sandwich.  I've also had a nice experience with the breakfast menu, Also close to the  bike path along the canal,"}
{"text":"Goldman's is a prime example of a delicious deli that was hiding right in front of my face! Yes, I've passed by Goldman's hundreds of times and it's a small sin that it took me this long to step foot inside. But, now I have and I am happy to report that this is going to be added to my rotation immediately!   First, I like that Goldman's has some serious pride in their love of Chicago. It's nice to see a deli with some passion and this deli is definitely passionate about their food and the Windy City. The menu has it all...burgers and grilled cheese to brisket and pastrami. Let's not also forget about matzah ball soup and other classic Jewish deli cuisine. I decided to try their famous hot pastrami sandwich. My bf has the brisket so I was able to try both! I think I liked the brisket better then the pastrami but the pastrami was also delicious. The food is definitely meat happy so come with an appetite or you'll be leaving half the sandwich on the plate like me. I don't think I would stay and eat here, but it's a very worth deli for on the go!   PS -- they also serve breakfast starting at 8 AM!"}
{"text":"The Kreplach chicken soup is delicious. It has a ravioli type of pasta item stuffed with seasoned brisket. The soup includes carrots and celery and is very flavorful.  Sam was very nice to answer all my questions.  The dining room has comfortable booths.   Next time my friend is sick, I'm going to come here and get the chicken broth and vegetables to go."}
{"text":"Great for matzah ball soup and hanging with the geriatric crowd! Bad for their grilled cheese :("}
{"text":"Ordered the Pastrami on rye. Very good authentic deli. You name it they have it.  Employer just moved nearby this location. Gonna try other items on this fast menu.  Had locals recommend the chicken soup."}
{"text":"Come on now. This is more of a sandwich shop than a Deli. They don't sell bulk bagels.( not even a dozen). The corned Beef and Pastrami are packaged. Most everything is brought in by Purveyors. But it's ok I guess. Just not the real deal."}
{"text":"I've been by this place many times but never stopped in before last week.  Fortunately, I got there before the busy lunch crowd rush.  I was debating between a pastrami sandwich or a Rueben and the owner suggested a pastrami Rueben which I thought was brilliant.  The sandwich itself was meaty and large enough to take 1/2 home for another meal.  I like this place and will definitely return."}
{"text":"This deli is mediocre at best. The staff act like zombies. Should the restaurant have an influx of people at one time (not to be confused with busy) the servers become confused and frustrated.  I have witnessed this phenomena. It is rarely full with patrons and that should be a red flag. I asked that my food order start all over  as it was cold (the server actually told me she was busy and it sat in the kitchen!). They microwaved the potatoe pancake and it naturally transformed to rubber. The remaining order was returned as cold as it was the first time around.   Bottom line...Avoid this place, it needs sprucing up and the food servers have personalities as if they were lobotomized. Bland, overcooked  food with food servers  being totally ignorant of customer service."}
{"text":"I ordered the turkey sandwich and coleslaw on my stop for lunch. I liked everything I ordered but I felt it was a pricy. The sandwich was a good size though and took half of it home. The décor here is pretty dated but has ample seating. The options here were also plenty and had stuff I'd never heard of or seen before. It's definitely unique to the area so if you're in the mood for casual but good food, stop here."}
{"text":"AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! Place!!! LOVE EATING HERE!!"}
{"text":"Now that I live in Old Town, this is my new \"go-to\" deli.  I've been a handful of times over the last few weeks and Goldman's has not let me down!  Recently, I've had their tuna salad, egg salad, vegetable knish and matzah ball soup (not all in one sitting).  Both the tuna and egg salads are light - not too much mayo - just the way I like it.  And, the tuna has a really smooth consistency and a sweet flavor to it which makes it unique... I think they must mix in some sweet relish or something.  Whatever it is, I really like it!  Again, not much on atmosphere unless you're into the over 60 crowd, but quality deli... I'll take out Goldman's any day!"}
{"text":"It was an OK sandwich.  The quality of the meat was very good.  The bread sort of became non existent before I was done.  The cole slaw was decent.  My friend got excited about some hard to find items she saw in their deli case.  If you are local it would be a good choice for a sandwich but not a trip across town."}
{"text":"As other reviewers have stated......If you are a Jew from NYC, this is the only deli to go to. Beware of Chompies.....everyone will tell you to go there but it just isn't as good as goldman's.  Goldman's has all the staples of a deli that you need. Try their noodle kugel.....sooo good it could be dessert. They also have excellent rye bread to have your sandwiches on.   -1 star because the prices are outrageous and the potato knishes tasted dry to me."}
{"text":"OMFG! The best-known for its authentic Chicago food. kaufman's delicatessen and The Bagel combination style grub. Everything is tastey and fresh. The owners were part of the Chicago scene from The Bagel and The Kaufman's delicatessen.  Try everything here!"}
{"text":"Had the Nova Lox and bagel...really fresh and tastey...great pickle too...Alsomy friend had the spanish omlette all veggies...fresh...will be back for soe of the soups...tastey"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place, it was super-hyped up in my subconscious mind.  So when I finally went to check it out, it disappointed.  I had a Corned Beef Sandwich on Rye and some Fries.  The Corned Beef was just ok and the Rye was *meh*.  The Fries were nothing special either.  I was expecting to be blown away, but instead found just another deli.  I might come back and give it another shot, but I've got too many other places on my bucket list, so it could be a while.  Return Factor - 50%"}
{"text":"I love deli! I have been a Chompies fan for years. Everyone has told me how wonderful Goldmans is, so I thought I'd give them a try. I called at 4:30 to order take out for dinner to pick up at 5:45. I ordered 5 pounds of meats and salads for my family of 6. I asked for a loaf of bread to go with my order and the person on the phone told me she had no bread for me. When I questioned her about this she told me I was calling at the end of the day and that I should call back in the morning. What? She told me she could give me three or four slices of bread. What? She said she wouldn't have enough bread to make sandwiches. What? I just ordered 5 pounds of food...isn't a $50+ order of food worth enough bread slices to make sandwiches for dinner? She was completely unapologetic and kept chastising me for ordering take out dinner so late in the day...it was 4:30pm and they are open until 8pm. What? Guess I'm not gonna find out how good their food is. Customer services means everything to me. I will be keeping my business at Chompies...they always have a loaf of rye and a kind word for me. Oy vey!"}
{"text":"Never a bad meal at Goldmans! The BEST matzo soup, I come whenever anybody I know is sick - like the saying goes, it's jewish penicillin! Stopped in there today for some to help ease a sore throat and I am feeling better already! :) they have a very extensive menu, all very tasty. They have wonderful baked goods, including delicious bagels and bialys! The restaurant is family owned and they always remember me, ask about my dog, who I brought on their patio 1 time 3 years ago, they really just make me feel good about patronizing a local business."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what to say about this place.  I'm from Vegas, and I was going to run home and give this place 4 stars, but then my girlfriend and I got sick.  Now I wasn't feeling awesome the morning we had lunch here, but she was just fine.  Coincidence, maybe?  Or did we get sick from the food here?  Not sure.  That aside, the food was definitely above average.  It wasn't the best Jewish deli we had been to, but it was a pretty cool find considering we were driving down the road talking about going to a non-chain sandwich joint when we saw the sign for a deli.  Goldman's did not disappoint in that regard."}
{"text":"If you're into Jewish delis and you live anywhere in the Phoenix metro, this place is probably already on your radar.   Previous to eating lunch here, I would not have considered myself to be much of a fan of the motza ball soup and sandwich combos, but, then again, things have changed since then.   I have eaten here a number of times and the soups are ridiculously good. Split pea will warm your soul with goodness, and the sandwiches are almost as good.  The brisket is exquisite and the barbeque is on point.   A big Shalom! to Goldman's for keeping the spirit of the authentic Jewish deli alive and well in the Valley."}
{"text":"Goldman's Deli is a true treasure in the heart of Scottsdale! Breakfast is served all day long, they make the best corned beef hash I've ever had! Prices are very reasonable and everyone is friendly and more than willing to make suggestions if you're having a hard time deciding on what you want.   Truly one of the best jewish deli's I've ever been to, all of the things you're looking for to satisfy your cravings, amazing potato latkes, variety of knish, matzo ball soup, borscht and so much more, not to mention halvah!!!   Every time I eat here, I leave remembering all of the amazing meals of my childhood that my grandmother would make for us! She put the same love and emotion into her food that Goldman's puts into theirs and it truly shows, it's the best you can ask for!!"}
{"text":"This rating is based soley on their soup and chopped liver. On my recent visit, my mom suggested we make a stop here on the way home to get some sweet and sour cabbage soup- and that we would get some chopped liver for my dad since he really liked it the last time. The sweet and sour soup was good but didn't have a lot of flavor. I actually prefer the soup I make myself. The chopped liver came with a choice of bread (we got the challah which was okay), and the liver itself was very tasty. I'd love to come back and try a sandwich, as the meat looked really good...so there is potential for a much higher rating after that happens!!"}
{"text":"Glad to have discovered this place. Good old fashioned deli. Doesn't feel like you are in Scottsdale, more in a Chicago or NY deli. The food is OK, portions are generous. The place does seem to serve quite a few regulars, and has a strong Jewish following. Each time I go, the lady working the counter inquires how family members are of the guests she is helping. It makes sometimes for a bit a wait as they take orders at the counter, but its OK. Rare to have that level of personal service these days. The authenticity, family-owned and home made style deli sandwiches make this place comfortable to visit. I haven't yet tried anything from the deli case, but one day I'll get to that. Don't expect a gourmet experience, do expect an authentic deli experience, so rare anymore in a sea of corporate restaurants and formulaic Scottsdale grub."}
{"text":"Pros: food is made to order so everything is warm and fresh. Whatever you're in the mood for they most likely have it. Very friendly atmosphere and polite and nice employees.   Cons: they always have a line! :/ so getting an order to go isn't very feasible. They're a little on the expensive side but they have great location so I'm sure they're rent is crazy!  Coffee is really good, the tuna salad is amazing! I really like the Arizona omelet with salsa. Their hash browns are really good and have great seasoning to them. And the peanut butter and jelly sandwich is on really good bread. You have to check it out :)"}
{"text":"9/15  My first visit, and probably my last for awhile.  Loved the pastrami and corned beef combo on marbled-rye, but found the slightly-under $12 price tag too high for a sandwich, chips, and a pickle.  I will note that I was able to squeeze four small, but ample, meals out of this: two with the marbled-rye, and another two meals from the leftover meat cuts with bread from home.  I might stop over and buy some deli cuts to enjoy at home, but I find the price paid repulsive, esp. when I drive many miles to dine out at least three days a week!  BTW, I chose to eat one-half of the sammy at nearby Crust, which explains the background."}
{"text":"Awful experience.  Had a table for 3 people  and  placed our orders at one time. The meal was not delivered together.  Each person had to wait 10 minutes apart to get served.  The blonde waitress yelled at us 3 separate times for asking that our food be delivered together so we could eat as a group.   Soups were thin and over salted, tasted like Campbells soup.  A customer dropped fruit on the floor and the waitress did not bother to pick it up.  Someone could have slipped on the floor.  If you like to be entertained by a waitress that yells at the customer this is the place for you,  It reminded me of the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld."}
{"text":"So excited to find this NY style deli in Scottsdale! Had a bacon egg and cheese on everything bagel and it was delicious. Cost about $6.50.   The female owner was very friendly and talked to me while I waited for my sandwich (which took about 5 mins).   Love the variety of menu and traditional Jewish foods. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on my lunch break a few weeks ago. Awesome deli sandwiches! They pile on the meat and the flavor of everything is excellent. Service is quick and friendly. Prices are very reasonable for what you get. Will definitely continue to come here."}
{"text":"This place is confusing. It has such real NY deli feel, with tons of sports memorabilia, and one heck of a Reuben. But half the place is a corner store deli that appeals highly to the elderly community apparently. There was a me ( a 30-something) and a dozen or so elderly patrons enjoying this deli.  The food itself was good. Huge stack of pastrami on the Reuben, and a real good potato salad. The side portion was pretty small, but the sandwich was ridiculously big.   I really enjoyed the homey, honest, NYC feel to the place. But I found just near the end of my time there, that they had a totally upgraded awesome sports bar type area down the hall. I was just even more confused.   So, though I don't know exactly how I feel about this place. The food was good and the store confused the heck out of me. I'll probably try it again sometime."}
{"text":"There is a reason why regulars come back to this Jewish Deli!   It's all about the quality of the food and great service.  They take pride in every meal prepared.  I've been here twice now and had the pastrami sandwich and soup.  There is no fat on their pastrami sandwich  and is was superb. I had the chicken noddle soup one time and Matzo Ball soup today and simply awesome.  I've had J J Deli's and Chompie's sandwiches and they have nothing on this place! No hot dog as ASU game tonight!"}
{"text":"I was born in the Bronx and have eaten at all the great NYC deli's. Not the touristy ones...the real deli's. When I came out to Arizona, people suggested Chompie's and a couple other places (one person suggested Einstein's Bagels for \"real New York deli food\" so I stabbed them). And by accident, I found Goldman's.  Outside NYC, people think I'm strange for ordering a turkey with chopped liver, red onion and mustard on rye with a pickle and square knish. The lady at Goldman's has never laughed...to my face. The counter case is filled with all sorts of top notch deli. There are no bad choices and it is always perfect.  So, if you're a New Yorker trapped west of Eight Ave. and you want REAL deli, stab someone for suggesting the Jack in the Box Pastrami Melt is just as good as them N.Y. deli's and head to Goldman's.  Tell 'em \"Stabby Finkelstein sent you.\""}
{"text":"Great deli! Went specifically for a tuna salad sandwich and it was delicious! The sweet relish in the tuna salad hit the spot! Yummy French fries and the pickle too! Perfect kids chicken basket for my toddler too. Glad we found this place on yelp!"}
{"text":"Cute traditional deli setup all around. From the  yellow \"soups and sandwiches\" advertisement on the outside, to the tidy counter equipped with an array of herring, giffelte fish, and tasty looking knish's.  A huge stand out is the cleanliness of the deli. You can tell they're devoted to making sure they're shop is tip top. Also if you're from Chicago you're sure to enjoy the Cubs and Bulls memorabilia on the walls. I ordered the everything bagel with lox spread, and added onion and tomatoes. The bagel was soft and fresh, but could have used a few more poppy seeds and onion. I like everything bagels to be a little over indulgent. The onions were nice and crisp, and the tomato was juicy. My only issue was that I felt the lox spread could've used more lox. It definitely would've heightened the flavor profile. Cute place though. Would love to try their lunch."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We stumbled upon it while biking and now we can't wait to return! If you like bread pudding theirs is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"So, I'm always on the hunt for a good Deli, especially out here where they seem to be non existent.  I saw another reviewer talk about this place recently on yelp, and thought that I MUST go check it out.  I can't believe I've lived here for 7 years and never heard of this place. How is this possible?  Anyways, Scott W and I came here and I really liked it.  I think its probably the best Deli that I've had since having moved here.  For starters, they have a really great full menu. TONS to choose from, and a small deli case with some side items in there to choose from.  Some of the things that won me over about this deli are the following. For starters, they serve Beet Borscht.  This, my friends, is by far one of my absolute favorite Jewish dishes.  My grandpa and grandma would make this from scratch when I was growing up, and bring it over to the house when I was a kid. It was always a treat to eat, and I haven't found anything as good since.  There's a few deli's in Michigan that serve it, but nothing out here that I would recommend.  I didn't get a bowl of it here, but the fact that they serve cold beet borscht is going to make me come back and visit again.  Secondly, they have real gefilte fish!  They serve it by the piece here, and it looked like it was supposed to look in the case...large with a carrot on top.  This, my friends, is the way to my heart.  In regards to my food, I really enjoyed my brisket sandwich.  I got it on challah with a side of fries.  Really really good, and it came with au jus sauce. I was able to plow through half the sandwich, and brought the other half home for later.  It was also a really a good sign to see other Jewish grandmas in there when we ate.  As someone who is not only Jewish, but has a high bar for Jewish food expectations, this place is awesome. I do plan on going back in the future for more, as I was really happy with my experience here.  Plenty of seating indoors and out, I really wish they had waitstaff instead of ordering from the counter.  This is a million times better then Chompies any day of the week, and I will gladly drive back here in a heartbeat to get more food.  Solid place, worth the drive.  Go check it out if you want good Deli done the way its supposed to be."}
{"text":"Great Jewish deli.   The closest I've found yet that reminds me of the delis of Chicago.  I would go again and recommend it if you want good food and pleasant service. Pricy, but when have you ever gone to a cheap deli?"}
{"text":"Always the best food with courteous service.  Nicest owners, outstanding food, fair prices. NEVER a disappointment."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful, family owned deli, who puts their hearts and souls into this place.   The food is delicious and the soups are out of this world. Everything is consistently good.  You know what you're going to get...does not vary like Chompies or Abe's of Scottsdale, which are totally inconsistent.,    This deli does not compare to any thing else in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  We moved here from the So Fl area four years ago and have been having breakfast/lunch or dinner here at least twice a week. You won't be disappointed, but so pleasantly pleased."}
{"text":"Great lean pastrami and cole slaw. Marble rye and challah were a little bland and dry. I always appreciate diet Dr. Brown's cream soda. Overall good lunch spot and handy location."}
{"text":"First time eating at this family restaurant. I had a chicken breast with Kasha that was yummy. The chicken was a little too salty for me. My partner has a BBQ chicken he said that it was do sweet. Nice place to eat typical Jewish food. They have varieties of typical Jewish food like blintzes,  lakes, knishes, herrings and even gafilte fish."}
{"text":"I stopped in for breakfast, I just wasn't impressed. I am an east coaster. I felt like the deli was dirty also. I don't think I would ever go back."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving was great!   Thank you so much for providing such a lovely Thanksgiving meal for those of us who weren't cooking.   The turkey was absolutely perfectly prepared, juicy and delicious.   Good gravy, and those green beans were over the top good.  We really enjoyed our meal.  It saved us from a forlorn holiday, far  from family and friends.    The food at Goldmans is not high end gourmet, but it's quite solid, always fresh and quality ingredients.    I don't know who their chef is, but he or she does a great job. The soups are very nice, and I highly recommend the daily specials.   Right  now my favorite is the Hungarian Goulash, although I do spice it up a little to suit my own taste for heat.   The meat is braised beautifully, tender and flavorful.  Served with fresh veggies and wide egg noodles, this dish qualifies for me as comfort food, as do all the specials I've tried.      Any kitchen that produces food made from whole fresh ingredients is good with me, and I have never detected a frozen veggie or noticed any of the cheap shortcuts many restaurants take these days. Goldman's is now my go-to place when I crave the comfort of a home cooked meal when I don't want to make one myself.     The service is always friendly and competent.    Kudos all around, I really like this place!"}
{"text":"Great variety of New York and Chicago style deli food. It is our small town version of the Carnegie Deli.    The breakfast are  consistently good. My favorite lunch sandwich is the chicken salad on rye which is always fresh.  Their soups are amazing and home made.    The owners are as nice as your favorite neighbors. I will be going back here for many more years."}
{"text":"Just skip it. Spent $16 for a terrible roast beef sandwich.. Bread was no good. Lettuce was wilted and the roast beef was so bland. For sixteen bucks you should at least serve London broil. The good news is the cole slaw was outstanding and they have real brewed ice tea."}
{"text":"Good solid deli fare. I have tried several sandwiches and they have all left me satisfied. I suggest they invest a little in the atmosphere if they want people to dine in (maybe they don't)."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  I bit on the pricey side but in all honestly you get what you pay for.  Loved e bagels and the matzo ball soups.  I'd recommend lunch over breakfast here but both are yummy.  My wife and I will be back"}
{"text":"In a word.  Yum.  So delicious. Pleasant service at the counter and a nice family run feeling inside.  I had the brisket sandwich with slaw and it was gone rapidly.  Tender, melt in your mouth brisket on a perfect kaiser rol was my choice and they provide a side of au jus for dipping if you choose.  The slaw was creamy and crunchy and done just right. You can't go wrong.  I may need to go back for breakfast tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I love the Hot Pastrami. My fiancee loves the Tuna Salad. I really find it hard to believe you could go wrong with anything on the menu. This place is a deli at it's finest!"}
{"text":"I really do love Goldmans. The only reason that i don't give them 5 stars, is that I get to NYC on business every month or 2 and get to go to Katz, Carnagie, Second St., etc., and get the real thing, and there is just nothing in Scottsdale (or Phoenix, for that matter) that really compares. The sandwiches are terrific and the soups are exceptional. I love the kreplach's in chicken soup, and the corned beef is really good...not too fatty but not dry, either. The pickles for the table leave a little to be desired (where is a good, puckery, salt brine pickle when you need one?) Carin had the chef salad and the chicken noodle soup and she thought it was really good, as well. I'm sure the desserts are good too, but after the cheesecake in NYC, the cheesecakes and other deserts at Goldman just don't look the same. I should try them before I say anything either way. The prices are good, under $20 for lunch for the 2 of us. We have been here 8-10 times since we moved back into Old Town from North Scottsdale, and I do think Goldman's is the best deli in town. BTW, I know Chompies has black and white cookies, but is there anybody else in town who makes them? I would like to find someplace to get one around town, rather than have to wait to go to New York to get a decent one."}
{"text":"I am Embarrassed to say that I have been in the valley for 12 years and never knew about the Goldman's deli who has been there for 18 years. I stopped there the other day for some takeout after stopping someone in the parking lot who had just come from the there. The nice woman in the white truck said that she is a regular there. So I decided to go in. I met Rosa and the wonderful staff that has been there for years. The food was outstanding.  In fact  I went back the next day and it was just as good.  My husband loves it!!!! Many more items to try!!  You have a customer for life.     Dawn and Mark  Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Love Goldman's Deli!!! Great family establishment with Chicago roots. My office is down the street. I am always craving the pastrami sandwich and a bowl of sweet and sour cabbage soup.. Always a good call going to Goldman's Deli!"}
{"text":"15 minutes to order with 6 people in front of me and more than 30 minutes to get a Reuben sandwich?  This is very disappointing.  I hope you can improve your process.  I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"There is a plethora of delis around here! My goodness me! It does the heart good to be in the center of so many choices when I have a yen for great food in the tradition of my upbringing in Chicago.  Goldmans fills me with delight because they try so hard to please. Everything is so delicious! You will love it no matter what you choose."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with a friend recently.  He ordered a pastrami sandwich, and I had a grilled cheese sandwich.  We each had a fountain drink, and we got a container of hamantashen.  Our total bill was over $30, which I thought was excessive for what we got.  The food was okay, but I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"this place is awesome! so much food! a little pricey, but it's quality. food is fresh with normal sized servings. lots of drinks to choose from! you really feel comfy here. it's quiet and lots of family oriented people here. very nice sweet staff, i can't really find anything bad about the place. the menu is huge! i bet they could add alot more to it if they wanted to. place smells fresh. i had the Turkey Club for my first visit, with fries and a drink. 15 bucks! Better be Amazing! i took a picture of it and posted it. it's big, but normal for a club, and overpriced for 10.99 just for the sandwich.... it is scottsdale. and overpriced food is what you usually get in this area, so i'm not to surprised. fries were ok, your normal frozen fried product. Iced Tea is awesome! all in all, place is great and i would probably return to try another item. i like the feel here. i recommend to anyone to atleast try it and see if it's for you"}
{"text":"Quality of food is good overall, although nuking your food in the microwave is not unknown (\"We don't have an oven hot enough to heat it in less than 30 minutes\") on a kasha knish.  They nickel and dime (one dollar for a bagel and a buck 99 for a bagel with butter).  Look carefully on the menu if you want to know that it costs an extra buck for a pastrami/corned beef sandwich.  The owner won't tell you until after she's run your card.  I mean the printed menu.  The giant one in your face doesn't mention it."}
{"text":"9 DOLLARS FOR AN EGG SALAD SANDWICH!!!???? Not today, I turned right around and walked out. You have got to be kidding me."}
{"text":"Nice little deli that is old school everything looks fresh and they have a lot of options. It's these kind of places that make the difference. Looking forward to try more of their sandwiches"}
{"text":"We needed a quick, non-chain restaurant on our way out of Scottsdale and stumbled on Goldman's Deli.  We're spoiled with good deli food in L.A., so I wasn't sure what to expect from the casual, order at the counter deli.  My son's french toast was a huge portion of thick sliced challah.  Unfortunately, it was too 'eggy' - I think he's used to my home made version with milk, vanilla and a splash of orange juice blended in with the eggs.  Omelets were good (spanish, corned beef and spinach/feta were among our orders) and filling so we took our bagels smeared with cream cheese to go for eating on the road.  The best surprise was kasha knishes on the menu - those are hard to find and the one we shared was pretty good.  I had to love the four bubbies sitting at a table playing mah-jongg.  Added to the authentic flavor of the place  Food was delivered to our table despite the counter ordering.  Friendly service and a decent deli when you're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Ordered the Ruben.  Overall it was pretty good...not remarkable, but good.  Cole slaw was ok.  Given the general lack of delis I would come back."}
