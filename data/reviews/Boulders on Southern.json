{"text":"Good food and a great atmosphere... As soon as we came in we were greeted and brought our drinks... We ordered bruschetta as a appetizer and it was brought out fast and was delicious"}
{"text":"I don't like to write negative reviews but the food and service are that bad.  On our way back from a late soccer game we yelp'd this place and the reviews are good but the reviews are the only thing good.  The food tastes like it came out of a frozen bag and was warmed up.  You don't have a restaurant with such low quality.  They lack pride in their business.  It was a true disappointment."}
{"text":"Let's face it- I am a pizza snob. Maybe it's because I've eaten my fair share; maybe it's I give myself too much credit; or maybe it's because I've been making my own for 16 years. I know, you don't care- got it.  Regardless, sometimes I'm just not up to the 6-8 hour task, and we outsource. Trust me, if they're  located anywhere near us, and deliver, we've tried them. This South East Tempe/Mesa/Chandler area really, really sucks when it comes to finding great consistent food, and especially so regarding Pizza.   Imagine my surprise when we stumbled on BOS. Jalapeño tots are to die for. Trust me when I say, good tots are hard to come by. The Sweet Potato tots aren't too shabby either.  The pizza- well, the crust is well-cooked. Yeah, read that again. You don't want to know how many hang-dog limpy-*** slices of pizza from various places I've had the pleasure of 86'ing. Oh, and the crust might give you a buzz as an added bonus ;-).  Tasty Italian sausage, generous w/toppings and a decent sauce. My only advise, if you get the Hawaiian, toss the \"slightly sweet\" sauce for the real deal pizza sauce. The sweet tastes too much like a bad BBQ sauce.  I cannot respond to comments about the brick and mortar location, or the deep selection of brews, as we have never been there. Our experience has been through Door Dash only (Don't get me started on them- fast and hot is what they should call it).   Now go, and be one with your chosen pizza."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The bartenders make you feel like you've been coming there for years and treat you like family!!!  I just moved around the corner and will be watching all the football games I can here. Want something different and unique as far as a drink goes...just ask!! They'll whip something AMAZING up!!!  Dave and Chaz are the best!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and decent beer choice. They have a bunch of different beers on tap and an even bigger list of bottles and cans. Atmosphere is great, they have a table with a fireplace outside. The staff is awesome and attentive. They even have an industry night!! Great place, I'd come back."}
{"text":"I'll admit, I didn't eat here tonight although I was here for 8 hours so I feel some of my review should be valid and trusted. First off, excellent service.  Met 4 or 5 people throughout my night and all were very nice and accommodating, even when they couldn't accommodate. What I mean by that is that the bartender apologized for not having red bull. I was mad 7 hours ago but not so much now. Good, strong pours here, Adam is cool and takes care of everyone. First time here but will be back for sure. They had the standard karaoke tonight, which is Wednesday, but they also had Bunco. It was a new dice game to me but whatever. They also have a pool table and touchtunes machine if you get bored. Again, only drank here for hours but will review food on my next visit.  By the way, I came here for NTN/Buzztime trivia but they don't have it now. The do have live trivia twice a week. Anyway, I'll be back. Great people here!!"}
{"text":"We were very hungry but unfamiliar with the area. Yelp reviews lead us to Boulders and we were not disappointed. The bacon cheeseburger had a great charbroil flavor and the teriyaki wings were cooked to perfection! Great selection of craft brews too!"}
{"text":"Delicious bar food and draft craft selection. Stopped by for a casual dinner Sunday afternoon. Friendly staff with just the right amount of attention. Mushroom and swiss burger with beer batter waffle fries and tatanka burger with buffalo wing sauce, blue cheese both perfectly cooked to our order.  We're making this our new neighborhood stop."}
{"text":"Felt very comfortable with the clean establishment, great vibe! Authentic service, collected staff and unscripted.  I am a service industry profesional veteran and i have never ever had better wings!  An undiscovered true exceptional neighborhood jewel."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great beer. My daughter and I can not eat wheat. It was great to see that another great place is offering gluten free choices. If you are around Southern and Alma School, Boulders on Southern is a great place to stop in and grab yourself some food and beer."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick drink with my wife. It was our first time. We really liked the decor and we sat at the bar. We were greeted immediately. The bartender explained the menu and drink list. They had a very good selection of craft beers on tap and in bottles. We tried several beers based on the bartender's recommendation. Each choice was very good. We also had the Southwest Basil Chicken Quesadilla and it was unique and very good. The prices were reasonable and we look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"This place is the best. It deserves 10 stars! I come here with my fiancé a lot. The guys behind the bar are awesome and friendly. They knew us by name after going in only twice and every single time greet us with a smile and a joke. Not only that but the food is always on point and delicious. I always ask for a beer they recommend that night as their list is always changing and always receive a great choice. Last time we went to celebrate our engagement and were given a round on the house and a couple awesome pint glasses! You rock Dave!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the first time because our cable went out and he wanted to watch the NBA playoffs.   All I can say is WOW!! The food is nothing short of excellence, and the ambiance is heavenly!! They have board games, plenty of TV's, darts, pool, and it is very kid friendly.   The food was AMAZING. I had the turkey sandwich with sweet potato tots and I will be dreaming about the tots until the end of eternity.   Our bartender was friendly and provided great service. Additionally, we both got dinner, and drinks and our bill was less than $40 which I feel is unheard of these days. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stop for lunch, looked fun, but to my surprise the food was awesome, much better then your typical bar food. My wife is a vegetarian and she had lots to choose from, her salad was better then most higher end restaurants. Pizza was great, great craft beer selection and a fun atmosphere. Service was great and fast enough for a quick lunch. I will definitely be coming back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Staff knows there craft beers better then me. I feel like at the brewery with all there beer knowledge. Food is amazing. Pizza was tasty. Bike friendly. Also kitchen is open late. One of my favorite bars in az."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience here food and service was excellent. I will definitely become a regular."}
{"text":"The food is basically inedible.  The wings greasy, flavorless and the dipping sauces watery and tasteless.   The cheese curds dreadful.   The grilled veggie sandwich an abomination.   I am a big guy and I could not force myself to eat this poor excuse for food.  Only redeeming factor was the house salad was fresh and the staff was great.   Have a beer here and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I think this is the second night they are open. 20 taps of craft beer including Piehole Porter from Historic, Firestorm DBA, Oskar Blues Dales Pale, Angry Orchard, Boulder Chocolate Shake and others from Odell, Lumberyard, Deschutes and New Belgium. The space is open and clean with a killer bar as the center piece of the restaurant. Great TVs for sports but not overpowering. Some really great pictures on the walls of adventures from all over the world. A big patio for warmer times of the year. Looks like it would be good for large parties with a breakout room in the back with space for meetings or board games or whatever you need. If you like bikes, pizza, beer and good neighborhood vibes, come check this place out. Sit at the bar with Brittany or David, they will treat you right."}
{"text":"When you enter, there's a big sign that shows the daily specials. We ordered pizza it was supposed to be a half price. Turns out you have to sign up to be a member of \"society\" before you order to get the special. The sign doesn't say that. I find that a scam"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. They have fantastic beers on draft. Molly and Brittany are fantastic bartenders. The night manager Dave is a great manager."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad when we finally got it.  The service was mediocre at best. Our server completely forgot about my GFs order and when we asked about it instead of apologizing and taking responsibility she decided to blame another girl who wasn't even serving us for the foul up! Some positive feedback they are kid friendly and have a good beer selection.  We will try them again and hopefully tonight's service was just a bad night and not par for the course."}
{"text":"\"Seat yourself\"...don't mind if I do!   Plenty of seating with open space is always a nice surprise. And the gaming area was a hit with the kids. I had the chicken pesto sandwich w/ the jalapeño tots-GENIUS. The woman in my life had the burger. My favorite son had the personal pan pizza (ham/pine) and little boy had the chicken...or so he thought   Pesto = delicious but empty. There weren't many books between the bookends, if ya know what I mean Burger = no complaints Pizza = hearty on the toppings!...I should have ordered from the kids menu HA! Chicken = didn't come out. Little boy got a grilled cheese sandwich by accident. HOWEVER, that was quickly resolved and chicken was brought out soon after.   Service was excellent! Really kind people working tonight! I'll be back for some more of those jalapeño tots!!"}
{"text":"Love this place  ..friendly  staff burgers are the best I ever had and I work in the kitchen   .highly recommended"}
{"text":"Quite a place to stop in and eat with a great outdoor sports theme.  This was hands down my favorite stop thus far on my cycling journey around Arizona.  From the moment you walk in the place is amazing.  I'm always cycling and this place had everything I needed including an indoor bike rack.  The service I got from the bartender, Jennifer, was AMAZING.  Her warm smile and friendly personality made my experience what it was.  I dont drink but this place has an amazing alcohol selection.  The food was outstanding too.  I had the Jalapeño tater tots to start and finished them up with their wings smothered in Jalapeño firehouse sauce.  Everything was delicious and very reasonably priced.  They offer daily specials and happy hour as well.  Justin, the manager, even came over and said hello while I was eating.  Their service is above all else and if you haven't been here you need to go.  For my FULL REVIEW and pictures of Boulders on Southern please visit my website at www.azspicycycler.com.  Like me on Facebook.com/azspicycycler and follow me on Twitter/Instagram @azspicycycler to see where Ill be next."}
{"text":"Food: I had the pesto chicken sandwich. It was ok. It was bland and needed some sort of mayo or sauce. My husband and father-in-law enjoyed the beer on tap. And my mother-in-law liked the sweet potato tater tots. Husband's nachos were something we could make at home as well  Atmosphere: Food took a while to come out. We were one of 4 parties, so I'm not sure why it took so long.  Happy Hour: all day Saturday! Drinks and appetizers are half off I think."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place! Always amazing service! Great employees! Nikki killed it! Its my birthday and she went above and beyond to give us the best service ever! If you are looking for A relaxing place to go with goid vibes and great people, come here!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Great atmosphere. Delicious food. The server was kind. He spent time picking out beers based on our preferences. The sweet potato tots were amazing."}
{"text":"I saw reviews that were all over the place. I decided to give it a try. (had a Groupon). The bartender (I think his name was Tom) was very pleasant. We discussed several beers and he had me try a sample of some. The beer selection is great. Lots of craft beers (not just he usual \"me too\" beers that many places have). They also have Bud Light on tap, so it's not just craft beers. Also a large selection of craft beer avail in can/bottle. The regular price of a pint of craft beer is as low as I have seen. Mine were $4.50 each.  My waitperson, Stepahnie, was delightful. We discussed the various pizza they had. I thought the thin crust pizza I ordered was as good as one would hope for at any pub. Both servers checked on me often. They always addressed me by name. Both told me goodbye and hoped I would return. Tom met me at the door on my way out and thanked me once again for having lunch there.  I like the place a lot. There were others there, both at the bar and groups/couples at tables, that also appeared to me enjoying their weekday lunch.  It is just east of Alma School on Southern (of course) The Southern Bus stops right out front. (for those, like me, who choose that mode)"}
{"text":"Wife and me just love coming to this place and relax and enjoy the great food and cold beer and just have a good time."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the burgers I've gotten from here and all the sides too. I've always had good service for dine in and takeaway so I have nothing bad to say! Id recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"I took a friend here for her birthday and boy, were we disappointed. We seated ourselves and it took a bit for the server to bring our menus. We ordered water and iced tea and that also took time. We ordered the grilled mahi salad and it was terrible. The salad was brown, the mahi came right out of the freezer and had no flavor. I was not offered more iced tea until I asked for it, and for my friend's birthday they offered her half price pizza. That is their Monday special. It wasn't for her birthday. The manager did comp one of the salads."}
{"text":"I had a really great burger and the service was great!  Now the food... It is legit. The waffle fries are some of the best fries around.  I had the Moose Drool burger. It was a solid burger, real good.  I asked the waitress about how the patty was prepared and when she asked for clarification in the kitchen the owner came out to chat us up about their fresh never frozen beef; I appreciate hands on owners.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"The staff is great.  Happy hour menu is good.  I love the atmosphere.  I'm staying at the Marriott across the street.  So, Come on down!"}
{"text":"Ever changing and large beer selection, knowledgeable and very friendly staff. They're glad to bring you small samples. Really good food too. Tuesday trivia night contest is a total blast. We will be back and back. Highly recommended that you give it a go."}
{"text":"I like this place for the atmosphere. I came her once before for a painting event and they had really good food and service. This was my return visit and not quite the same experience. There is multiple football games going on versus last time. So it is really loud and service a little slow. The food was very good. I had fried spicy pickles which were very good. I also had the cider beers hitch I loved. My husband had the fish and chips and homemade potato chips, he was bummed because they did not have cocktails sauce, weird; it was also cold. I had the spicy pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato tator tots.  My sandwich was really good but the pork was a little dry. But the homemade sweet potato tator tots soooo good. So all in all I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went to Boulder's for the first time last night with my wife and some friends. As soon as we entered, we noticed a pretty laid back environment and atmosphere. We ordered our drinks and they came out promptly. I loved the variety of beers! Shortly after, we ordered a few appetizers, including fried pickled, fried cheese curds and buffalo wings. The appetizers were amazing. I ended up ordering the grilled mahi-mahi tacos, which were fairly mediocre, but they came out fast and they were sizable. Our server was great as well. I wish I could have gotten her name so that I could her a shout-out. She kept our glasses filled and our orders hot. We will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Very large bar and very good bar food.  Fast, friendly service.   Have gone here many times when I'm in the area.   Great drink prices.   Nachos are great.  Burgers,  too.  I've never had anything less than a great experience here,  but I only go here during off peak times. ....like lunch or midafternoon.  Nice environment to chill."}
{"text":"My husband and I just went here for the first time and we will be back! The wings and house salad were delicious!  The service was so top notch that we gave our server a 40% tip!"}
{"text":"Food was over priced and not that good at all.  Service was terrible and bartender had a temper tantrum when we had a problem with our order and she refused to remake and just gave us part of or money back and was extremely rude And it was her mistake. ..so never again. With this kind of service they will be out of business soon"}
{"text":"My wife and I used to come here on dates when they first opened in Mesa. I was excited to have a brand new bar in the area. Not only are the drinks good, but the food is way better than you'd expect for bar food. We loved this place so much that we ended up hosting our wedding rehearsal dinner here. We wanted something more laid back for the occasion and knew the food would be good.  Justin, the manager, was more than accommodating for our event. We kept in constant contact up to the day of the event. I called before we were scheduled to arrive and they were already cooking the food for us. We chose a buffet style so people could make their own plates. By the time we all arrived, people were seated and food was being brought out.  Our waitress Clarissa was very attentive and constantly checked on our group to see if we needed refills. We had our own section tucked away from the main bar which gave the event a very private feel. Everyone enjoyed the food (especially their pizza rolls) and we ended up ordering a second round of wings given how much people ate.  We were extremely happy with how things turned out. I highly recommend stopping in for lunch or hosting a private event here. Thanks Justin for making our wedding rehearsal dinner special!"}
{"text":"Stopped here because we saw the great reviews on Yelp. Was totally worth it. Food was absolutely awesome. Husband got the Cheese Beef Sandwich with au ju.  He could not stop raving about it. I got the Elvis is in Patagonia calzone....OMG! It was to die for. So juicy but if you don't like capers tell them.   I would totally recommend this place to anyone. The staff were all very nice and we found out they have Karaoke on Wednesday and Trivia on Tuesday...so come prepared for some fun!  Oh also there is a Groupon. Coupon  for this place that saves you quite a bit. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Right across from my hotel.  They have a nice beer menu and decent food.  It's a nice way to end the night with a good beer and sports around.  The place was clean and friendly with good service . I'll be back"}
{"text":"I am giving this place a perfect review because I can't think of anything to complain about. I got a pizza that had a delightfully thin crust. We also got some of the house made chips and they were great. The service was good too."}
{"text":"My husband and I and our two boys have been to the two sister restaurants, Spokes on Southern and Boulders on Broadway for many years with our two boys and always have felt welcome and had a good experience.   They are now 10 and 13 and we were looking for a place to dine tonight with a great beer selection, good food and a pool table.   Boulders on Southern seem to fit the bill and we were all excited for our monthly night out.   Our service and food were good and our waitress did a fine job getting us what we needed but we  were disappointed with the IPA selections.     We told our boys that they were not going to play electronics tonight, so they had fun playing the board games available instead.    When we finished our meal we headed over to the pool table and dart area.    Although, I do not feel my boys were disrespectful or misbehaving, they were approached at least 5 times by the manager telling them they were doing something wrong.    My husband and I are the types that don't mind adults correcting our  kids and I feel the manager approached them in an appropriate way, so I didn't think much about it the first few times.   We  just reminded them of the rules, were playing with them and told them that  if any adults were waiting, we should give up the games.   By the fourth or fifth time they were approached(none of them warranted in my opinion), I was frustrated and wanted  to go home.    I had to ask several times for a check and to get my license back from the dart deposit.      I am just frustrated with society!    Everyone is so easy to judge IPhone use at restaurants and overuse of electronics by kids but when you let them do anything else, people seem to judge and belittle them.    I don't get it, and I don't think it's fair to treat families this way when they are trying to enjoy your restaurant.     I feel my boys are like any others at this age.   They may not be perfect but I feel we have raised them right and that they weren't doing anything to deserve the treatment they received.     So, I can not recommend this as a family friendly restaurant and in the future I will just stick to Gilbert restaurants that almost always seem to welcome kids and families!      I really wanted to love this place and was hoping  we could visit with our kids again in the future.    I don't believe this will happen but I hope they can make some opinion changes about children in the future based on this review."}
{"text":"We love Boulders on Broadway and were happy to discover that Boulders on Southern is similar, yet better! The space here is much more open, clean, and new! The menu is similar, if not identical, thank goodness - BIG FREAKING NACHOS cannot be missed!! The beer selection is fantastic and the service was also great. Would highly recommend this location to enjoy a great meal and craft beer."}
{"text":"Not happy with this place. I have given it multiple attempts and tried different items. Even the soda tastes flat. Maybe if I liked beer but it's close to work so I keep hoping I will find something I like. This was the last straw. Big plate of nachos and paid extra for chicken it was dry and pieces were more lick slivers. No flavor. This is the last time I try this place!"}
{"text":"Same great beer selection, good service and waffle fries--something spokes took off their menu..    Place is brand new and some speed bunps will be:    Work on tv volume for football games, way too loud (get some sound dampeners)  Dim the lights at night, way to bright   Otherwise food, beer and service were solid!  We look forward to seeing this place evolve."}
{"text":"Terrible service each time we go...the staff is rude, looks at you like your causing them an inconvenience and often are hanging out, rather than running a business. I love the food, but won't go back."}
{"text":"This wasn't just a good menu or great beer selection (it was that too) it was a good environment.  Boulders is neighborhood hang out material.  We immediately felt a welcoming and friendly vibe.    Inside is roomy and comfortable with a lot of TVs about.  Outside has a fire table (is that the official name?) and pic-nic type tables with benches, as well as a couple of high-tops, I think.  The menu looked to have a lot of good options:  Huge nacho app, different tacos, including a mahi mahi one, burgers of all types, a Chuck Norris pizza, etc, etc. . .  I could have been happy with a number of options!  Seriously, I like a big menu with a lot of different options.  I got the quesadilla and the addition of pesto is genius.    The beer.  The beer menu had all kinds of things.  I got the rhubarb sour---which is delightful--and I do not see rhubarb enough in the world!  We also tried the PBJ beer and it really tastes accurate--amazing!  We tried the orange beer in a can and it was nice and light and creamy.  Then our server, James, recommended the draft coffee beer.  It was a mix with Oskar Blues (first ever to sell craft in a can so super-bonus points from me) and it tasted like coffee.  But that beer tasted light, not heavy and syrupy like some coffee beers can be (AZ is too hot for heavy beers most of the time!).  The service was prompt and friendly, and we were really impressed that we were treated like friends and regulars immediately.  That's what stood out most to us--though the food, beer, and seating are A+."}
{"text":"I'm in Phoenix for a few days and have been enjoying chances to get good food and beer not available in Utah.  This place failed on both.  The beer list was weird and boring, heavily tilted to stout and having essentially nothing other than Americanized British styles.  I had a calzone, which would have been good were it not for a heavy rosemary taste in the crust. Service was spotty. There are better options out there."}
{"text":"This place has solid food. Get the fries. I know, I know, it's a classic dish. But trust me, the fries here are bomb. And no, I don't mean \"after drinking, everything fried tastes good\". I mean, their fries are ACTUALLY good, decently seasoned, not under, not over, and not drenched in oil nor dry either.  For me, the five star rating for Boulders on Southern is a personal thing. I recently was out in Colorado exploring various cities, entertaining the possibility of relocation. Boulder as a city stood out. Loved it there. Some might say some weird stuff about the city (\"it's so full of hipsters\" \"we call them boulderites!\" or whatever). For me, this place is great.  Just as a disclaimer, Boulders on Southern has a primary location on Broadway in Tempe, AZ, shamelessly called \"Boulders on Broadway\" which has equally great food options but a different tap beer selection. For me, Boulders on Broadway is where it's at, Boulders on Southern is just... Different.   To start, Boulders on Southern is in Mesa, AZ. This city is notorious for seeing restaurants set up shop, and then die. Not too far away from this location is Main St, infamous for its decaying look and the city's attempt at gentrification, bringing in new money in an attempt to revitalize a once beautiful city. Gotham, of Arizona.  And yet, Boulders on Southern stands strong in its food offerings and beer selection. Its decor is mellow, having almost a dive bar look and yet remaining strong in its presentation otherwise. It has an outdoor seating area, and misters to mitigate the summer heat of Arizona.  I'd return more regularly, but I currently live in North Phoenix on the border of Scottsdale. Wish they could set up a third location in either one of those cities...."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Got a groupon and was pleasantly surprised. Had salads and a pizza that was delicious! Great service, homey atmosphere"}
{"text":"We hit this place while in the area and loved it.  Great service, yummy food and strong drinks ;)"}
{"text":"Went here for beers. A great craft selection. Our server Adam was supercool. The help always makes a place better. Sorry we could not stay for eats."}
{"text":"This place rocks! You can always count on them having a great selection of beers on tap that is constantly rotating. Beer events and tap takeovers on the regular as well. The service is top notch, and they definitely remember you when you come back. The food is great, highly recommend the mahi tacos or the carver pizza."}
{"text":"I've been trying different restaurants and bars for many years now and some have been not as good as others but the service or lack there of that I received at Boulders on Southern last night has prompted me to write a Yelp review for the very first time. As my date and I came in, we noticed that there wasn't a hostess present at the door so after waiting for approximately 5 minutes or so, we made our way out to the patio. We sat at the patio for another 10 minutes and no one had come out to ask if there was anything we needed. I finally went up to the bar tender, whom was very courteous and helpful. I asked for menus and 2 beers then went back outside to our table in the patio. I knew that staff knew we were sitting outside because I heard the bar tender tell one of the waiters that she had 2 menus for outside. As my date and I waited another 15 minutes or so without having anyone to come outside to take our order, I went back up to the bar and placed our meal order and got 2 more beers. Thankfully the bartender was nice enough to bring out our dinner and I'm actually surprised I didn't have to go back to the kitchen and cook it myself. We ended up finishing our dinner and drinking 2 more beers after that without anyone coming outside to help us. I work in public safety and understand the importance of providing great customer service because that is the foundation of a successful organization. The restaurant wasn't even close to being full by any means so I didn't really see any excuse for the lack of customer service. I would never recommend Boulders to anyone. The food was mediocre, the beer was good but nothing that you wouldn't be able to get at a different brewery that places customer service as one of their main priorities."}
{"text":"I have been in town for the first time this week and the staff here have been awesome! They call me by my name and knew what I wanted to drink. Made me feel like a local. When I'm in town next, I'll be here for sure!  Also, bad ass beer selection and no country music like the other close bar and grill."}
{"text":"Grant concocted an absolutely delicious black bean burger for vegans with lightly vegan battered onions, jalapeños and sautéed mushrooms...freakin awesome!!! The place offers an array of crafted beers, lots of tv monitors for game viewing and an attentive staff. We'll be back! Try the citrusy Lagunitas Sakitumi draft beer!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They have the best Saturday Happy Hour in the valley and their food is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"This is our new go to Saturday place. The food is amazing, the service is great, and the all day Saturday Happy Hour can't be beat. This is absolutely the best Happy Hour in the valley. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Famous fish and chips,, totally black and burnt.. tastes like old oil...   I was disappointed.!  So sad"}
{"text":"Just moved into the area & was looking for somewhere to grab a quick bite.  We seated ourselves as the sign said & within a couple of minutes was greater by a server who took our drink & appetizer order.  She was friendly & asked if we had any questions.    We started with the battered cheese curds & they were a delight!  Hot little morsels of gooey stringy cheese accompanied by each dipping sauce. For dinner I had the Sunday special (9inch single topping pizza for $5.99).  My husband had the 9inch Chuck Norris pizza.  Both were delicious.  Neither pizza was sparse on toppings.  Both pizzas came out hot & did not disappoint.  We were asked numerous if we needed anything & how everything was as well as having our beverages refilled without having to track someone down to do it!  As we asked for the check, our server also asked us if we had a Boulders' membership card & when we told her it was our first time, she brought the card & application to fill out along with our check.  The only negative was the music was very loud!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere great! Beautiful woodwork decor, food delicious, prepped to order buffalo wings, extra crispy, staff fun & professional, great drink menu, priced well!!"}
{"text":"I had great service, the place was full,people seemed happy. The drinks were great! The food great, had a  beef sandwich. It was clean, the wait staff attentive. I'd absolutely go back and bring friends. Totally worth the trip. Thanks guys for a fun night.  Went back with a different friend. Great service again great drinks.Love that it's nearby. Thanks again"}
{"text":"Still figuring out how to do brunch right, but a great place for beer and lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"I ordered a medium rare burger with avocado, bacon, grilled onion and a side of waffle fries for delivery. First off I specifically ordered it without tomatoes and there were still tomatoes on it, the moisture from the tomatoes made the bottom bun ridiculously soggy and unappetizing. The meat also seemed a little undercooked. The fries were pretty good but a little salty. I was also a little frustrated that you couldn't order a drink when getting the food delivered. I wanted to like this place but it didn't seem worth it, overall it was just an OK place to eat."}
{"text":"As a previous patron of Boulders on Broadway, I was already expecting a good experience for this particular location. \"Good\" does not begin to describe my experience at Boulders on Southern.  First of all, it is an almost brand inside and out. There is a spacious patio with standard bar height tables and rustic picnic tables for larger groups. They strategically placed the patio on the southern side of the building to alleviate their outside customers from the blazing Arizona sun.  The parking lot is more than accommodating for the space, providing plenty of spots on even busy weekend nights.  When you step inside, you are greeted with a warm, rustic, \"seat yourself\" atmosphere that offers tables for small groups, medium size groups, and large groups as well as a full wrap around bar, pool table, dart boards, and even board games. The bathrooms are exceptionally clean and modern, offering over-sized stalls (I am referencing the women's room) with a trough style granite sink.  All these cosmetic attributes are great, but what I really want to rave about here is the service. From the moment my husband and I sat down, we were given, hands down, the best service we have ever received at any bar here in the Phoenix area. We chose to sit at the bar and were immediately presented with food and drink menus. The beer menu here is nothing short of outstanding, offering a wide variety of flavors for every taste bud. Our bartender, David, was the most accommodating and personable server we ever had. Period. He was fun, approachable, and super patient when we weren't sure what we wanted to order next. We sampled many beers and, because of his prompt and friendly service, ended up ordering an $18 bottle of Four Peaks Morning Ritual rum barrel aged brown ale (which, by the way, is worth EVERY penny of its cost). Despite having many customers, David didn't break a sweat and we never had to wait longer than a few minutes for our drink order.  If the management ever reads this, you guys have a great bartender and we will be returning to visit him/the venue on many occasions to come.  I usually do not write reviews this long, but I am seriously impressed with this place. The food is amazing (we ordered a side of fries and the pizza nuggets) and both were cooked to perfection and in an extremely timely manner. Couple that with the level of service, wide beer menu, and the clean/appealing ambiance, and I think I have found my favorite venue in Mesa! Keep up the AMAZING work David/team of Boulders!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Chaz the bar tender is great! Made us some very unique shots that taste like heaven! Happy hour all day Sunday! Can't wait to go back for fried everything!!!! Pool table, darts and board games! I could live here!"}
{"text":"I have prismatic dreams of their glorious pesto chicken quesadilla. We've been coming here every Friday for the past three weeks and love everything about this place. The beer selection is amazing, they've got so many interesting brews to try (rather than eighty increasingly  unpalatable IPAs). Jayla is great too, she remembers what we like and keeps the beers coming. Great atmosphere, glorious beer, yummy food, nice staff, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim with a Groupon and was disappointed. Burgers were SUPER dry and did not taste very good. 40 dollars for 2 entrees, an app and 2 beers seems kind of steep. Definitely glad I came here with the Groupon but do not plan on visiting again."}
{"text":"The look and feel is pleasant, it makes you feel like you are in a mountain restaurant with the wood decor and the log cabin feel.   Their service is welcoming and on target, no waiting at all. I was there alone since on a trip to Phoenix alone... the staff chatted and made me feel very comfortable.   I had a small pizza... Amazing!! Oh and very good Bloody Mary's made daily.   Going back for dinner before I leave Arizona."}
{"text":"Great beers, had a decent selection. Food was good, ordered onion rings and spinach artichoke dip with no complaints.   The dip was no match for Four Peaks dip but it was still good.   Teresa did an awesome job!"}
{"text":"Just ok, not worth the calories, but it is a bar before grill."}
{"text":"Had the artichoke deep fried starters which were ok.  The pulled pork was pretty good.  The pulled pork was definitely robust on the meat.  The bartender was pleasant and nice."}
{"text":"I visited this location last night with a group of friends and had a pretty good time. The food was ok, the people were very nice. Everything was fun up until I left. I was sitting in my car when one of the bartenders came and started to hound me about a tip. He was upset because someone hadn't tipped the waitress on a $70 order, which is understandable but that wasn't MY tab! There were 2 separate tabs at that table and I had tipped the waitress on my tab. I wouldn't be upset but even after explaining this to the bartender he still continued to hound me. I can understand the frustration but you don't hound a customer like that. I can honestly say that last night was the first and last time I visit this location."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon went there excited to try the food got a soda which was a terrible mix so try cited not to have soda got water tasted nasty decided to get my order to go and they wouldn't take my coupon the man had an attitude the bartender had an attitude and all I was trying to do was get food don't go here let this place goes down they have three customers to begin with let them have zero now"}
{"text":"Really good place came in for the first time and was honestly surprised how good the food was and they have a all day happy hour on Sunday too which was kool,will definitely be back...oh yeah they deliver and you can pick orders too"}
{"text":"I don't typically write reviews but I was very disappointed in the service last night. We arrived around 7pm, grabbed a both and saw numerous servers pass by and no one said a word or acknowledged us for 15mins!!! I finally stopped someone to ask for a menu or if we order at the bar. We ordered 2 beers which were OK and we each got a 9\" deep dish pizza. 40 minutes later a server tells us the kitchen is backed up and as we're about to leave they bring out 2 tiny pizzas!! Nothing special. Atmosphere is ok just be prepared to wait for anything you order."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Not very busy. Ordered the bbq pork or rather a bun with very little meat.  Some bites were bun only ?!?!?  Had a great flavor.   Kids burgers were charred and they did not enjoy them.  Canned pineapple was the fruit was expecting fresh. Good waffle fries."}
{"text":"I would have actually really liked Boulders on Southern a lot except for the fact that the service leaves something to be desired and the floors were ridiculously sticky.   It is open seating so this could possibly account for the long time it takes for a server to notice you but it takes a longer time to place your order and an even longer time to get your food. What's going on? I happened to also take one of the Vino & Canvas classes offered at this location. There was an assigned server to the group of us painting. That guy was on his game. Taking orders like it ain't nobody's busi-ness and making people smile (because they are getting their drinks). Why can't it be that way in the dining area as well?  The floors: Are they being mopped in beer? I was practically suction-cupped to them the whole time. Others agreed. It is not a pleasant feeling to peel your foot off the floor with each step you take. Next time, I'll be sure to remember to wear my Swifter Wet-Jet sneakers!  Despite those missteps...the food was really excellent and a great value for the price. The HH Spicy Fried Pickles are oddly super addicting and they have cheese curds on the HH menu too! On Saturdays, if you are signed up for their loyalty club -- it's free btw -- they offer $6 burgers & sandwiches. That is a ridiculously awesome deal! That price even includes a side - waffle fries, sweet potato tots, or fresh fruit. As one of my friends likes to point out: You can barely get that at fast food restaurant nowadays and then he proceeded to order another burger.   They have a huge list of drinks on tap and in bottles. I'm sure just by the sheer vastness of their offerings that there must be something in house for even the pickiest of drinkers. I know I was intrigued by a few of the listings.   If service could improve and they invest in a better mopping systems, Boulders could really be great."}
{"text":"We came here because we wanted a night out and we wanted to spend as little cash as possible. They take VCA scrip for everything except tax and gratuity which is awesome!  Our waiter was Andre and he was great. Attentive but not obnoxious.  The food was good! We had wings (nice and crispy) and cheese curds that my boyfriend loved. He had the bacon cheese burger with BBQ sauce and jalapeño tots. I had the salmon BLT with waffle fries. Everything was fantastic. Service was great. It seemed really slow for a Friday night. Maybe it's the location that hurts them. I wish it were closer to east Mesa. We will definitely be going back next time we want to have a great relaxing meal using our VCA scrip!"}
{"text":"This establishment is pretty darn good, I was very impressed with their Burgers the meat blend is very tasty and cooked to perfection, the atmosphere is very pleasant the people are a good crowd and everyone interacts.  I have to to give the employees a high five,  they are eager to please and very attentive to the customer. My 4 stars is only because I am a 2 time customer and I want to give them room to grow (not a negative).   Give this business a try I am looking forward to others feedback."}
{"text":"Used the online order app, it's 20 minutes past from when they said it would be ready(been waiting 50 min total) bartender greeted me saying I don't check my emails so I just got it.... Thanks dip crap. The food will suck as bad as the service! Do not recommend!"}
{"text":"I went here today for brunch.. just moved here from CA .. I'm glad I found this spot.  Great drinks.. the brunch was good for the chuck Norris scramble.. the bartenders are funny & make you feel welcomed!!"}
{"text":"I was torn. On one hand, fantastic beer selection. We all tried something new and they were great. But the food was just not as good as we'd hoped. Tried a little of everything, from burger to pizza, apps and sides. Pretty standard bar food. Nothing outstanding. Perhaps the stand out is the beer, so will be back for happy hour."}
{"text":"Great food and good drinks , nice elevated bar and good selection of craft beers! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"So my sister got me a gift certificate for Boulders lolz. she forgot we had a bad experience there. So we thought we would just go and spend it on beers. I got a beer that came with a slice of orange....the orange had a hair on it. Probably beard hair....so we left the gift certificate on the table and left."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on a Friday night.  It was a fun atmosphere with a great selection of food and beer.  Our cheese curds were not awesome, but the southwest turkey and honey chicken sandwich were both really good.  Super reasonable prices and a fun local hangout bar.   Our server was not super friendly or personable but our food came out in a timely fashion and we always had drinks on the table. It's nice to have a place like this in the neighborhood, and I can't wait to go back for trivia night with a larger group of friends!"}
{"text":"I got the moose drool burger which was good but a bit too greasy for my taste. The fries kind of tasted like they were frozen. My husband got the happy hour nachos which were tiny and I could have made those in my microwave. To top it off, my stomach started to hurt and later on in the night I got really nauseous and threw up and felt terrible all day long. I probably won't be coming back to this place which is unfortunate because the atmosphere was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Cool new restaurant spot.  Menu is better food than you would expect from your average sports bar, so it's really much more than just that.  Great selection of sandwiches, burgers, appetizers, salads, pizza, stromboli and pastas.  1 star.  They also have great vegetarian options for pretty much everything on the menu which you don't find often.  2 stars.  Great microbrew selection on tap.  3 stars.  Awesome feel and atmosphere, with photos from the outdoors, traveling and adventure sports everywhere.  Decor has a modern clean mix of wood, concrete, river rock, aspen and an interior bike rack for your ride.  4 stars.  Great service, odds are the GM Justin will stop by your table to make sure you've had a great experience.  5 STARS!"}
{"text":"Cool place!! Driven by a few times and thought it's time to check this place out! Glad I did, lots of beers on tap and a really fun vibe. The bartenders are really nice and on top of their game, looks like a fun place for older kids and families. Eating elsewhere tonight so I will try the food again another time."}
{"text":"Ordered to go from door dash. The moose burger had no cream cheese. Was dry and had little flavor for how much it has on it. Spinach dip also lacked some flavor. Came with stale chips. Don't plan on ever ordering or going in again. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out...the staff is very friendly and helpful.  Great beer selection and the Hard Day Pizza is amazing!"}
{"text":"Meh, it's just ok.  I live in Phoenix and came to trivia on a Thursday night.     Parking: There's plenty of parking.    Service: Not great at all.  The restaurant was barely crowded, but I do not think they had many wait staff. The person who was assigned to our table came by very rarely. Also, we had a gift card from a previous trivia win. The trivia person mistakenly wrote \"2016\" instead of \"2017\", and she herself (the trivia leader) scratched it to indicate 2017. The wait staff thought we were suspicious or something.  We had to request waters two separate times.   Atmosphere: The restaurant has a main floor then, one can climb up a few stairs to a bar area.  It seemed pretty dead on a Thursday night. There were some meet up groups there to play trivia.    Food/drinks:  OK...not fantastic.  I had part of a Caesar salad but not super impressed. It had quite a few red peppers in it. I had some french fries off another plate, since nothing sounded that great to me.   I had parts of the pizza nuggets, which are not nuggets at all but little sticks of cheese bread. They were actually pretty good.    The drinks were not fantastic either. However, I guess if a person is into beer, those options are pretty good.    Cost: The cost was somewhat high for such a crappy place.  The bill for a few drinks, an appetizer, and one meal was over $40.00 for not great food/drinks."}
{"text":"Great music- variety of classic rock and metal, yummy food - I had the BBQ chicken salad which came with the perfect amount of chicken and zesty ranch dressing. Last but not least the service - fast & friendly!"}
{"text":"Waited over a half an hour for a menu and then another ten minutes to put in an order. The waitress said she'd see if she could do something for us since we were forgotten but then nothing was done. Because we arrived around 6:30 we should have had plenty of time before happy hour ended at 7 but didn't even get a menu before then. I had to stop the waitress after she had taken an order to even get two menus for our party of four. We also missed a free pint glass promotion because of the oversight. Still paid full price. Do not recommend this bar. Couldn't even play music during trivia because football."}
{"text":"My Husband and I love Boulders!  Great beer selection and the bartenders are always helpful in recommending beers that I'll love! Portion sizes are large, chicken wings are nice and crispy. Servers are always friendly.  If your in Mesa try it out!  Also a great place to watch sports games."}
{"text":"Ordered the fish and chips. It was fresh and tasty. The Waffle fries are delish. Don't expect to be greeted with open arms. It's a bar after all. Sit wherever you want and grab the menus from the bar, lol."}
{"text":"Place is great. Super clean, friendly staff! Wanted a memosa but no champagne sadly.. Definitely look foward to coming back and trying more off the menu!"}
{"text":"Service was slow, just getting drinks and the place wasn't even that busy.   The kitchen screwed up my order and had to wait while everyone else are.   Good beer selection if you enjoy craft beer, you'll be disappointed if you're a bud light guy any my food was good once it arrived,"}
{"text":"We went on a Football game night. Only one table left. Took 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge we were there another 5 to get our one and only drink. Then a hour to get our burgers! When the food came the server apologize and said it was free however the burgers and the buns were so burnt we couldn't eat them. So he took them back and was having new ones made. My husbands  chicken  sandwich was ok but the fries were cold. When our next ones came they were better but the buns were still somewhat burnt.  And the fries were not that hot. Mind u we only got the one drink also. We will not go back. Zero stars if it would let me!"}
{"text":"Great tater tots and delicious burger. Was disappointed that their all day Saturday happy hour was moved to Sunday. Beware RC soda, no Coke or Pepsi products. Yummy beer!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff; no question about it.   Another place the cooks have to add salt......    Man; I wish places would back off on it.   I don't salt anything, so the least bit of it on any food just ruins the taste for me.  Can't give them a good score because of that.   Had barbecue; that too seemed salty.   No sauces...  I asked for sauces.....   NC wins the Barbecue battle between SOUTHEAST and SOUTHWEST....   Hands down on that.... Unless Boulders is not the place to compare with?   Mexican is too far a walk....  Maybe we'll get a can and try that ........"}
{"text":"Personally I prefer the other location. I felt really silly after we came here for my boyfriends birthday. I had let the server know it was his birthday. (correct me if I'm wrong but is it uncommon to mention that at restaurants and they usually bring a free ice cream or something?) That's not the point. I mentioned it was his birthday and she just nodded her head like oh that's cool why are you telling me this. So I got a little embarrassed. Anyways, the food is delicious. The fried cheese is my favorite. And the nachos."}
{"text":"Not a great experience.  Delivered the wrong beers to each of us and only come to find out when we ordered more of one of them that she had served each of us the wrong beer.  I drank less than a third of my beer because I didn't like it (with good reason as it wasn't even what I had ordered) and they they didn't take it off the bill.  They then ran out of the one we were going to reorder.  Asked for the bottled beer menu and she says its on the back - flip it over and it's blank.  Brought my salad out right away but took another 10 minutes for my husband to get his - a minute before the entree showed up and with shriveled up grape tomatoes to boot.  I've never seen my husband not eat a salad until tonight.  Waitresses couldn't answer our questions about the menu or the beers.  Ordered the burger medium well and came out medium/medium rare.  Just a very blah experience all the way around.  We couldn't wait to get out of there.  We won't be returning.  While the restaurant itself is bigger, newer and nicer than Boulders on Broadway - Broadway wins in overall experience.  Their wait staff is attentive and knowledgable and their food is good."}
{"text":"the chuck norris thin crust  is quite likely the best pizza in the city, the bartender on the weekend is really good at his job, not the phony kinda goood at his job , but actually very genuinely good at it , we'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Expect quality food, beers and a crew that genuinely cares about your happiness . Boulders provides a local hometown experience in a clean and down to earth environment. Do not expect food to be out 7 minutes  or servers to be asking if your doing \"okay\" every five minutes. Come in and enjoy good company with quality food and drinks."}
{"text":"This place is seriously delicious. I went in on a Sunday afternoon and the place was mostly empty so I was a little worried. I have no idea why this place would ever be empty; it so yummy.   I know this place is all about the pizza and burgers, but their tacos are so good! I had the steak tacos and they're to die for! So unique with teriyaki cream cheese. Omg, amazing.   My husband got a burger and he thought it was great. My son got a kids sized pizza and I ended up eating half of it because it was so good. They have a GREAT selection of beers too! Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"If you love a bar and grill that can really pair good beer with good bar food, this is your place."}
{"text":"Great burger. Bbq salad very good according to the wife. Good service and music at right level. Interior nice and not too crowded like buffalo wild wings"}
{"text":"Wish I had more money to eat out, because I'd be here all the time.  Boulders has always been impressive when it was on Broadway, so I was thrilled when I figured out the home I bought had a new one right next to it, in walking distance. Not only that, it's beautiful inside and homey in a way the older one on Broadway isn't.  It didn't take long for my financee and I to really fall in love with the place and their gigantic rotating selection of craft beer, so we decided to do our engagement party there. We certainly didn't regret it! They have totally reasonable prices for platters, and assigned us our own waiter for a cash bar and pitchers who was super nice and somehow (must be magic) kept everyone's names and orders straight.  The food is phenomenon for a bar. They have some of the best pizza in the Valley, and I adore their burgers and sweet potato tots. Prices are always super reasonable, so you can get exactly what you want, plus a pint or two (no way you can go to Boulders and not have a pint!). They're beer aficionados and it shows, because our waiters always have suggestions for us based on what we like to drink (I'm a stout/porter person, she's into Hefes and fruit ales).  Plus, they have a loyalty club that is a total bargain. We've already cashed in something like $30 worth of free food coupons, a free pizza coupon for her birthday, and went to a \"First 100\" loyalty party where they gave away all sorts of free appetizers all night.  I really have no reason to ever want to drink anywhere else. This place is clean, the waitstaff and managers are nice, the prices are reasonable, and the beer and food is awesome."}
{"text":"Bartenders are nice.  Drinks are tasty.  But what keeps me coming back is the Chuck Norris Pizza and the Waffle fries.  OMG delicious."}
{"text":"Great beer and amazing service! Chaz is the best bartender ever! The guacamole and chips are amazing and the sweet potato tots are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Just in the area and stopped by for some apps and a few brews. Outstanding  craft beer selection and the food was great. The bartenders David and Adam were awsome, friendly and funny. Definitely going to be my must stop when in the area."}
{"text":"I probably wouldn't have come here, except for the fact that I was given a $5 coupon to the eatery with my Players Package for a Disc Golf Tournament. I'd been here when it was a previous establishment and it was run down and unpleasant.      The new management has done a wonderful job of fixing it up and improving every aspect of the location. It's very pleasant inside and the staff is wonderful.      My wife and I had a great meal on our first visit, that included a thin crust Hawaiian pizza and Fried Zucchini. We went again a few days later and enjoyed a plate of Nachos with Chicken, that I couldn't stop eating. I usually don't eat allot because most times the chips end up soggy after a few minutes. These stayed crisp since there wasn't tons of refried beans on them.      The beer selection is nice with lots of variety. There are TV's with sports.      We will be back again. It doesn't hurt that it's only 2 miles from home."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The food is always good and the servers are so friendly. We love going Sunday nights they always have multiple games on. You have to try the quesodilla."}
{"text":"I have only gotten this for takeout. The food is good but I gotta admit there is not much of a wow factor. This place is decent and good place if you are super local.  \"Trust your fat homies, we are big for a reason.\""}
{"text":"I came here for a visit on a date with the husband. We had a great server who was super helpful, attentive, and friendly. I got the fish tacos and the hubby got the bacon cheese burger. Both were awesome! Hubby ordered his burger between medium and medium-rare and for the first time ever we got a burger that was actually cooked to order. Other places we say medium and there is no pink! Lol we got the cookie with ice cream for dessert and it was awesome! I also highly recommend the waffle fries!"}
{"text":"I had the LA snob pizza and added pesto sauce per our server's suggestion. It was great tasting on a thin crust. My partner had the Kaiser calzone, he thought it was very good and cooked well. It was served with the marinara on the side,  good for 2 meals :-).  The staff was attentive."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great beer selection. Looking for a place to have pizza and beer.. this is the spot."}
{"text":"Surly bartender (gal who is angry all the time). Needs more TVs esp close to bar.  Weird TV layout in bar and dining areas. Small TVs at angle at bar.  Main beer taps at bar obscure 4-5 seats' view of the TVs.  Good sound Mediocre beer selection (only two IPAs on tap) Need more TVs on patio Cool decor Friendly service Daily specials are nice Regular food prices high All day happy hour Sat (but only $1 off drinks) Decent (small) whiskey selection Big patio Hope they make it but will need changes."}
{"text":"This is a sports bar so it is noisy. That is excepted. The food is very good. We had burgers, clearly flame grilled, good toppings. The wings were good, the fried zucchini was good and the ceaser salad was very good. Excellent selection of beer. The sweet potato tots also really good. Good servers."}
{"text":"Great food, Fast deliveries, professional, polite, and engaged staff. Never been into the restaurant but the delivery services that I've gotten Have been on time or early. No damage to any of the food items. And I always get what I ordered. I would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Food was really good, the calzones and tacos were top notch. The jerk wings were a tad salty for my liking, but everything else was really great. Service was good and there was a good craft beer selection and reasonable prices. I am sold."}
{"text":"A group of us went here after a Spring Training Mariner's game at the A's stadium in Mesa. The first thing that struck me was the warm, relaxing decor. It was more like a classy restaurant than a sports bar but the atmosphere was just right for a sports bar. The staff made sure we had a good table for all 11 of us and put the Gonzaga March Madness game on for us.   There is an extensive beer menu with something for everyone's taste.   I had the chef salad which was delicious and my husband had a calzone which he enjoyed. All of us agreed that the food was great. Our server, Nikki, was top notch."}
{"text":"The BEST Saturday happy hour (all day!)  Prices and food are great. Onion rings are suburb. Any burger six bucks. Awesome service."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party on a Saturday evening. About 30 people attended. An appetizer spread of assorted chicken wings, pizza rolls and crudette platter started off the evening. Later the buffet table was populated with both pulled BBQ pork and chicken with Hawaiian rolls to wrap it in. Accompanied by pasta salad, coleslaw, and beans. Everyone seemed to enjoy the buffet because their plates were all empty, including mine :)  There was one waitress who took our drink orders. She was very attentive and friendly, keeping our water glasses full and constantly clearing the empty plates. The Boulders had a list of beers to chose from. I couldn't comment further because I had to work later that night and had to abstain from alcohol. A very enjoyable evening and venue for a party."}
{"text":"My family and I visit this place on 9-11-16. We were in Mesa and in the mood for a good burger, it had 4 stars on Yelp so we gave it a try. I was more than disappointed to say the least. My husband and I ordered two draft beers which we waited about 15 minutes for. My husband, son and I all ordered burgers and a salad to start. We got the salad and it was ok, besides the cucumbers which were already bad by the clear soggy appearance. We shrugged that off and waited for what we hopped were going to be great burgers. After a long wait we finally got our burgers. My son had ordered a bacon cheese burger and there was no bacon. From experience I know the server should return within 4 to 5 minutes of the food being delivered to make sure everything is ok. That never happen, so my son started eating his waffle fries. Immediately when I took a bite of my burger which I got cooked medium it tasted of dirty grill. It was pink on the inside like it should be but tasted like burnt food debris. When our server finally did come around I mentioned the lack of bacon on my sons burger and she had more cooked. When that finally came it also had the same black matter on it from the grill. I asked my husband and son how their burgers were and my husband said his tasted burnt. My son had only taken two bites because he was waiting for his bacon but also said his didn't taste good. I asked my son to open the burger and could see all the grill debris on the burger and his bun had burnt grill marks on it as well. By then I had lost my appetite and all I could think of was getting the terrible taste out of my mouth. The boys headed to the car and I asked for the check and boxes. When the boxes and check were brought the manager delivered them. I let him know how our meal was and how unhappy we were. He seemed genuinely apologetic and comped the food which I did not take with as I knew we would just throw it away. He asked for us to ask for him or the other manager if we visited again. I doubt we will."}
{"text":"Service excellent.  Beer options above average.  Exceptional wing sauce.  Had BBQ orange sauce and Jalapeño.  Needs to be cooked more, but excellent flavor and service was the best!  Owners care if you are happy."}
{"text":"Not sure if my city-slicker California palate has me spoiled, or if it was just an off-day so I'll share this review for folks on the fence about trying this place if they haven't before.  The Good:   Seat yourself - No waiting for a table. Just find a table of your liking and sit.  Clean tables. Well, since you pick your own table, I guess I wouldn't have picked a dirty one.  Food choices. Lots of good pairings (sounded good in writing).  The Not-So-Good:  Seat yourself - Since you didn't have to wait for a table because you sat yourself, you will have to wait for the waitress to notice where you sat. (Shrugs)  Food. The food choices sounded good, but preparation was lack-luster. I got the smoked chicken pesto bruschetta (see, sounds good huh?). It was cold and the chicken, as dry as the desert air. Again, maybe just an \"off night.\" My kids liked their food but hubby's BBQ pizza was meh. The pan cookie dessert we got was burnt. Just wasn't a good night.  Service will be neutral. It wasn't good neither bad.  Would I come here again? Maybe, since it was so highly recommended, I have to think they were having a bad day. Get better!"}
{"text":"We live in Portland, OR and know what makes a good brew pub. This place is awesome! The food was phenomenal, the atmosphere was great, and the staff was super nice and funny."}
{"text":"I'll start with they have everything in the way of bar food. It's more like an European tavern. Reliable service over each visit. They never complain about our huge groups of 30 that show up. Never whine about requests for water- even when they get a pitcher for themselves."}
{"text":"Awesome new spot in Mesa.  Great beer selection and menu.  I had the Piehole Porter that was delicious and the Moosedrool Burger.  Hard to beat jalapeno cream cheese and onion strings on a burger.  Careful with the smokin' jalapeno wings, as they are spicy (just the way you want them!).  Finally a great place to eat and grab a beer in the Fiesta District area, the place has a really great feel.  Can't wait to go back and try the pepperoni wheels (picture a pizza version of cinnammon rolls!)"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.....way way too noisy and I've been to plenty of bar and grill places that have better noise cancellation. My husband ordered the fish and chips and they were super breaded and dry. I didn't get anything since nothing sounded appeasing. Our server was nice but got a 14 top group which made our service turn lousy. We may try it again but doubtful."}
{"text":"Love the people and the atmosphere! Craft beer heaven. Get the salmon BLT its delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I was staying nearby and when I rolled into town, it was after 10PM. I was pretty hungry from not eating as well as flying across the country.  The hotel staff recommended I try Boulders, I'm glad I did.  It took the bar tender awhile to acknowledge me (I'm not a regular), but after he did, I placed my order.  The food is much better than you might expect from a bar."}
{"text":"Fantastic yet again! Come check the place out! Over 20 craft beers to try!  Burgers and pizza are great  Service is awesome too! Waitress and bartenders are pleasant"}
{"text":"Great drink specials, good food but lousy service. We had a large group of people celebrating a special event. No one took our took our drink orders. The waitress and  I can't remember her name but she was an African American (not being racist) gal, was so rude she yelled at my wife in a very angry tone just because she was in Mid conversation and wasn't available the second she got there and she couldn't wait just a moment. She demonstrated no patience and instead chose to embarrass us and herself. There were almost 30 in our group and we were all in agreement that if we ever came back it would only be to sit at the bar as we will never get table service there again. On a positive note. The bartenders were great seeing as we had to keep coming up there for drinks since nobody was taking our orders."}
{"text":"We came here on a Tuesday for a game of team trivia to help celebrate my birthday. The first thing we noticed is how much roomier this location is compared to the one on Broadway; I actually had room to breath. The food menu is the same, and I love it. Their wings are definitely the best wings I've had, and even though it's a bar, their pizzas are pretty great too. The service was ok, but I wish she would've checked in on us a little more often. We had three couples, so we asked for three checks. The items on all the bills got jumbled up, but we worked it out among ourselves. The trivia host was very hard to understand. They have speakers all over the place, but we just couldn't understand him. I'm not sure if he had the microphone in his mouth, or if the speaker nearest to our table was blown out. Either way he sounded really muffled, so I would recommend sitting closer to him if you go to play trivia. A great experience nonetheless. We'll be visiting this location more often for sure."}
{"text":"I live in Southern California, Boulders on Broadway is always my go to pub when I roll into town. Delicious food and always great service!  My most recent visit to Az, I decided to check out Boulders on Southern, they did not disappoint. Like Boulders on Brdwy, the food(and brew) is on point.  I usually order the Grilled Pesto Chicken sandwich or the California Carver burger(my 2 favorites), but this time I had the Southwest Fish Tacos, after I gave my order I contemplated changing it to one of the other items listed above......but decided to live a little and enjoy something different from Boulders! ....and so glad I did, those fish tacos were the bomb.com, loved the spicy aioli sauce, just wow!  Our server was Chaz, he was friendly, made sure we had everything we needed,and that we were happy with our order.  Thanks Chaz, you made our visit to the Mesa Boulders a great dining experience.  Phoenix is on our calendar late November, as is yet another return to Boulders!"}
{"text":"1st visit in, definitely a soild place to stop. Great beer on tap, loving having a selection and trying new stuff. Plenty of seating at bar with plenty of tvs. A lot of the people seemed like regulars. Not overly packed for a Friday night but not empty either. Will be stopping again!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, semi cold beer, lousy service.  Bonus: hair in your pizza.   Stopped in with my husband and son after our son's football game. We were looking to try a new place and the reviews were good. They lied.  We were greeted promptly and ordered drinks, but waited a long time for anyone to take our food order. Husband had the Chuck Norris pizza, pepperoni pizza for my son, and pesto chicken sandwich for me. Food was ok, but my husband's pizza had a hair in it. We might have mentioned it to the server but we never saw him again. We had to flag someone down to get drink refills, and we had to go to the bar to pay our check because they were literally ignoring us."}
{"text":"I will be the first to admit that I am extremely picky and can be hard to please at restaurants. I don't often give 5 stars unless I really mean it. This place deserves it 100%! The pepperoni wheels are delicious! Usually pizza and pizza related items are super heavy and greasy. These are not like that at all! In fact they are light and airy and just delicious! So light that you could easily find yourself eating 2 or 3 plates of them! And the jalapeño tots are awesome! But what really stands out is their awesome drink menu! I am allergic to beer so it's a bit hard for me to go to a bar and always find something other than soda. I highly recommend both the unicorn tears and the fruit roll up. This place has become a new favorite and has definitely pushed our normal bar hangouts out of the running."}
{"text":"I hate taking the time to write reviews so the fact that I am is a miracle! I Would have to say that its the best food within a 3 mile radius. Great place to grab lunch and I'm sure its a great bar at night I just haven't been there in the evening."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim not knowing what to expect. It was a Sunday afternoon and the sign sailed to seat yourself. We waited a while at our table and we didn't see a server walk by anywhere. We almost left but finally when the waiter came out we decided to try it anyways. The food made up for it all! It was so good! We had burgers with sweet potato tots and fried zucchini as an appetizer. Will definitely be back just hoping the service is better!"}
{"text":"Came in for quick bite after work. I ordered the gudah and potato soup with the jerk bonless happy hour wings. I also got a Moscow mule and the Citrus margarita with strawberries. The wings were really good packed with flavor and really meaty. The ranch is really good as well. The drinks were equally as good as I would have to say the Citrus Margarita was my favorite. Know for there soup i did not like it. There was corn kernels that really watered the consistency down and took away from the cheesy flavor. My server was really and and very attentive."}
{"text":"Well where do I start with this trainwreck.........service was slow at every turn. From the second we sat it was a forever wait for a beer cause they lost our order for drinks. Ordered a steak sandwich as a friend also did, horrible, toughest steak I have ever been served in an establishment. Frys were cold as well as the sandwhich. I was starving so I ate it, or what I could chew through. My friend ordered a steal sandwhich and had to return it. The staff was nice a out it and offered to replace the order at no cost......then the chicken bruschete replacement order comes with a big sharp ass bone in the chicken  lol worst meal in a long time and won't return. ****update .......left my review at the table and didn't make it out the door.....some weirdo is begging me for money.......lol really?  Vagrants in the restaurant asking for money lmao.  Nice place"}
{"text":"I was ignored for 15 minutes as limited staff moved back and forth. I did not eat here but suspect that the would have taken quite a while to ultimately get served."}
{"text":"I'm sure I am joined by many others when I say I came into this spot due to my familiarity and satisfaction with Boulders on Broadway.  While it appears to be slightly more upscale and has an open feel, it is consist with the Broadway location in regard to menu, beer, and customer service.    On one of my earlier visits I came in because I had a Groupon and it just so happened to be Trivia Night (Thursdays at 6:30)!  While I am not an avid bar trivia attendee, I do love my Jeopardy so I was happy to join in and play!  Also that night they had Prescott Brewery in the house promoting their beer and passing out sample for those in the bar.  Give me trivia and give me beer, it's a good night!  Spicy fried pickles too?!  Perfect!  While their service tends to be on the slower end, everyone there is extremely friendly, and helpful!  I highly recommend coming in for their happy hour due to some great app deals and stick around for dinner, trivia, or karaoke (Wednesdays, I believe)!  Great hangout spot!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town; this review is based on my first experience; and first impressions are everything, right?  Atmosphere is chill and clean. David, the bartender shook my hand and introduced himself. He spent time going over their draft beers and menu with me since I'm a first-timer. The food runner dropped my food off while addressing me by name. Needless to say, I felt like a regular! The beer was cold, the food was hot (and quality portions for the price!). I wish there was a Boulders in LA! Many thanks for making an out-of-town girl feel welcome!"}
{"text":"I volunteered here for a beer festival the bar hosted. After I was done, the manager/owner Justin generously gave out tickets for the beer festival to taste the variety of beers they've brought in. It was a great, fun-filled day and I'm glad I was able to volunteer at a cool establishment like this.   My friends and I decided to sit at the bar to enjoy our beer tasting. The two bartenders there (Adam and Steve) were two of the best and most attentive bartenders I've ever come across. Hats off to those guys; they were excellent bartenders.   The beer selection is pretty awesome. They have a good variety of craft beers on tap and many additional ones in bottles. The food was also another high point. We shared the spicy fried pickles and fried zucchini - both were part of their all day happy hour on Saturdays. I also ordered a bacon burger with a side of sweet potato tots. The burger had good seasoning and the tots were nice and crispy.  I had a very enjoyable experience overall and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Just an ok restaurant.  Very slow service.  Waited forever for a waitress to take our drink order.  She didn't apologize for the long wait and wage was kind of cranky to boot.  It was a very slow time of day, so I don't know why the service was so very slow.  My daughter had the honey chicken sandwich and it was way more bread than chicken.  Just average for this place."}
{"text":"My husband and i were hungry and talking about getting food while we were at home depot. the owner said he opened this restaurant and gave us a coupon to eat there. We decided to try it out and the hamburgers are amazing. I love the atmosphere. There is a place for families or groups of friend to sit. if you wanted to go there for a drink and to play pool there is an area for that as well. We will be back."}
{"text":"Good food,great service,fair price! No need to go into details. ...what else can you say!? Great place, definitely plan on making this place a regular stop!"}
{"text":"We just stumbled upon this place today. It's a great find! It has a large variety of beer, full bar, good food, excellent service, etc..."}
{"text":"The interior looks much better than it did when RTO's was here and the food was good but the service was absolutely awful.  It was lunch and the place was virtually empty.  We ordered beer and lunch.  It took 10 minutes for the beer to come and that was after us asking where it was.  The server (tall blonde girl) just slid it on the table (it was a bottle).  We ask for a glass.  She gives you that \"you are a pain in the ass look\" and goes to get one.  Wait again.  We have to go and get the glass ourselves.  She said she is busy with a table of complainers---gee, I wonder why.  If you want repeat business, you'd better have a better staff than this chick.    The food was good---southwest fish tacos and pulled pork sandwich.  We did order steamed veggies and they were steamed, but barely.  Could hardly get the fork into the carrots!  Don't think it is worth the trip back.  If the service is this bad when it is extremely slow, imagine when it is busy!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with friendly staff and tasty food. We had the calzone and it was super delicious, the crust was so buttery and perfectly golden brown. Cheese curds were good and the fried pickles hit the spot. Nice drink specials and TVs for watching sports. Great spot to get together with a bunch of your friends for some great food and good times. Navigating the parking lot might be the only challenge of your visit."}
{"text":"We were here visiting family , and this was the only bar by our hotel open past 10 on a Wed night. It fit the bill so we decided to come back on Fri for their Black Friday beer blast. And a blast we had! The karaoke was fun to watch and the drinks were good. Our waitress Nikki was awesome and we never had to wait for a drink even though it was pretty crowded. Couldn't give it 5 stars because of the queso dip. It was very runny(think cheesy water)and flavorless, the amount for two wasn't even a full cup. I would give their food another go next time."}
{"text":"Just left this place in Gilbert! It was absolutely amazing! Food was delicious and the service was beyond excellent! The menu has a lot of options and the staff was very welcoming and informative about beer menu and the food menu! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we will definitely be back! I ordered the Moose Drool burger with a veggie patty and it was by far one of the better veggie burgers I've had. The black bean patty went perfectly with the jalapeño on the burger. Portions are just the right size and it was all great. Definitely recommend for fellow vegetarians! As for meat lovers, my boyfriend got the same burger as me but with a meat patty and he loved it as well."}
{"text":"Great first impression. Comfortable atmosphere. Good food. The place seemed a little slow for a Saturday but looked like it could get rocking. The only thing that bothered me was once we got the bill it took forever to get cashed out. I hate that because thats when people are ready to leave. I would definitely hang out at thus spot again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here every weekend absolutely love the half priced wings and fries. I love fries but I'm very picky about them and I have to say these fries are my top favorite. I hope they don't Change a thing to the mine or prices. We rave about it to all of our friends. We went to the boulders on Broadway and it didn't compare at all. Boulders on southern is where it's at. The could use less tables and more pool tables though. They have a shelf with board games which is a blast when you're drinking, eating dinner, an having a good time. Their wings used be a lot bigger but they seem to be getting smaller in size each time we go. Regardless I love this place and recommend it to everyone"}
{"text":"They have an amazing beer selection and the food was good! Not overpriced, and amazing quality! I would love to make this a regular place!"}
{"text":"Out my budget. But the burgers are worth it. Used a Groupon to save $10.00. Onion rings are good."}
{"text":"Very good bar just like spokes on southern and boulders on Broadway. The beer menu has good variety, the food menu, from what I've sampled so far, was filling and delicious. Big open bar and a lot of tables."}
