{"text":"I was at a training session across the street and stopped in for lunch.  The owner was serving and it was great."}
{"text":"5 stars for the value at this joint. 50 things under 7$ several under 5$. Breakfast here rules. If your on a budget this is the spot, and the food's good either way."}
{"text":"Great place to get a bite whether you are on your lunch time or just want to get some good food at a decent price!

I have been to this place since 2010 and have never been disappointed!  There are daily specials displayed on an outside board and the staff is very friendly.  Jim, the owner, is usually working at the joint and will flash a smile and chat you up a bit.  It is amazing to see an owner that is very involved and remembers just about every customers name that walks through the door.  

Personally, the breakfast burrito is my favorite and will leave you full!  Can't go wrong with this joint!"}
{"text":"Good lunch. Supreme Sandwich or a Bowl of Chili are always rocken!! Breakfast on the other hand go with the Croissant Sandwich."}
{"text":"I have leaned to like the Philly cheese steak, the fries too crispy but they are a fat fry which I prefer over shoe strings. Just go ahead and ask for no onions because they don;t seem to know the meaning of easy onions.  They are cut large for the most part, so they are easy to see to remove.  I had my hotdog made Chicago style, that doesn't mean I want celery seed (no City Square Cafe doesn't use that salty stuff but most AZ restaurants do), I lived in Chicago for many year and never had a hot dog with celery seed. Any way.......that celery seed sent me on a tangent,  My last two hot dogs were splt down the middle but were still cold in the middle,  was the thing frozen when they started???  By the way,  those wonderful fat french fries are no longer cooked to that hard point,  I like that!!!"}
{"text":"been here several times. every time, the tables were not wiped between customers, the portions were too small, the taste was just ok, and it too way too long to come out. if the plan is to run a small restaurant in a corporate plaza, you gotta be faster, cleaner, & more pleasant, or at least have better price point. I'm pretty much done with this place, it's just not worth the effort/price."}
{"text":"Great cafe right outside of my office (City Square).  It's always busy, but the lines move quickly and they manage to get your food out in a reasonable amount of time.  The owners (husband and wife duo) are always there working the counter or in the back and are extremely pleasant. 
With regards to the food, you get pretty large portions and the quality is always good.  I once had a chopped salad there (on special) and it rivaled some of the fancier restaurants I've been to.  I tend to get the salad with tuna and for $6.50, it's more than sufficient for lunch.  The drinks are very cheap as well...right around $1.25 for a huge cup!  My coworkers hit the cafe up every morning for coffee and usually for lunch since there aren't very many options in the area.  
Most of the items on the menu are $7.00 or less, which is a great price for lunch downtown.  They have everything from breakfast sandwiches, to pancakes and french toast, to burgers, to wraps, to salads.  You name it, they've pretty much got it.  If you need a quick spot to grab lunch and you're in the immediate area, definitely stop in."}
{"text":"Food options around my workplace are plentiful. Some are awesome, some are meh. Thanks to yelp I found this hidden gem and I am extremely happy about it. 
So far I have had a rueben sandwich, an asian chicken salad and a burger here.
The rueben was really good and so was the burger. The salads here are meh, I had a Greek salad that had 4 pieces of tomato and 4 cucumber slices, stay away from the greens and stick to the sandwiches. The owners are nice and no nonsense. They have a great little place here."}
{"text":"Cheap breakfast, great portions and very nice owner. I would eat here all the time if I lived here."}
{"text":"If I worked right here, I'd probably run in here frequently for a quick breakfast sandwich. They have standard basic lunch choices like sandwiches, wraps, etc. I had a mushroom burger which was just okay. This wouldn't be a place I would stop for truly healthy choices or clean foods.  

The place is trying to be swanky  (wood tile ceiling, bright green panels down columns, wood quotes, etc), but it doesn't seem to be kept up well. The trim between tiles on the ceiling is rotting or dirty, the baseboard looks like it was cut by hand to accommodate the dirty outlet plate."}
{"text":"I had the club sandwich. The meat portion was very generous. And the side of cottage cheese had a bit of tang that was to my liking. The atmosphere was comfy and there's 2tvs with sports playing."}
{"text":"OK. So I've only had a toasted everything bagel with cream cheese. I'm not a New Yorker. I'm not a bagel expert. I know the yelp debate on this culinary disc can get more heated than a black leather seat in Phoenix in July. But each time, it's perfect. Cream cheese is spread evenly on the bagel. Bagel is cut in half and wrapped in white paper. I hate the places that serve you cream cheese in a little squeeze packet. UGH! I never get all the cream cheese out and end up cutting it open and licking it out. Like the lady in the commercial squeezing ketchup packets at home into her ketchup bottle to save money.

The gentleman behind the counter is friendly and remembers my name even when I don't. The menu has pastries, hot breakfast and hot lunches. You can also grab fruit, yogurt and Snapple. There's plenty of reading material and the decor is simple yet comfortable. 

It's tucked away at City Square Plaza (gee, thus the name)...next to the Light (De)Railed Cafe. Yep. It's 86'd. 

Thanks City Square Cafe...for allowing me to make a pit stop on my way to work. Those three blocks can be grueling in the summer and it's refreshing to cool down a bit before walking 200 yards to my job."}
{"text":"Simplicity at its finest. No matter when I come here, it's always the same home made goodness. Fresh and a daily specials await. Never disappoints. Great value, great service. Eat and leave at your own pace. Always fast props service. I come here often when I need a cheap meal in the area. Will come back and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The owner was very nice and the food is great with really good prices! Me in the people from my office definitely be coming back here for breakfast more often :)"}
