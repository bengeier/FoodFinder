{"text":"Should of definitely ate at the buffet by time 4 waitresses walked by while we waited for 8mins to even get a greeting or smile... When got our drinks my 4 yrs olds drink was all over the cup I had to wipe it off! They knew I was frustrated and then wouldn't stop bugging! Food was fast but not much flavor. Had to chase someone down for napkins and no refill!"}
{"text":"I ate breakfast at Cafe Fiesta this morning. The Denver Omelette was hot, fresh and tasty. The hash browns were hot and crispy as I asked them to be. The staff is very attentive, friendly and is clearly professional.  For $11 I got the aforementioned omelette and endless coffee: reasonable. I was full after that meal. Unless you're very hungry, I would recommend the Cafe over the Fiesta buffet (on the second floor): the Cafe's food quality is much better, the atmosphere more pleasant and the staff more seasoned."}
{"text":"2 Stars for the food. -2 Stars for the service!  We were promptly seated on a slow Friday evening. No much going on in the cafe. There were 4 servers working the floor. We waited about 15 minutes for someone to notice we had no water. Then we waited another 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge that we haven't placed our order. So, about 50 minutes total from the time we sat down until food came to table. Totally unacceptable.  Big fat ZERO review from me!"}
{"text":"I just had their classic burger with pepper jack cheese and sweet potato fries.  It's a half pound, grilled however you like it, and I must say it was delicious!  I almost went to the Fatburger in the food court, but I figured I would give the cafe a shot, I'm glad I did.  I liked the food much better than Fatburger and it was a better price in a clean and comfortable place with excellent and friendly service.  I will happily be returning to this cafe again."}
{"text":"It is what it is, certainly not some fancy restaurant but still very good and very well priced. Great spot to grab a quick and easy bite. I will say the manager Brad is amazing he went out of his way to get us a menu item that had been removed, a few weeks back. Great job Brad!!! Highly recommend their breakfast items so good!!!"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I  were in the Henderson area and way past our lunch break so we decided to stop in the Fiesta Henderson for some lunch.   The servers inside of this little cafe were very friendly and accommodating.  The cafe menu was pretty much what one would expect from a casino diner, there were options of various foods for all taste. I opted for the orange peel chicken, while my dining companions chose Mongolian Chicken (not marketed for chicken, but for beef, the waitress and kitchen seemed happy to oblige the switch), and a parmasian chicken sandwich,  which looked tasty as well.   My orange peel chicken was just ok, really, I have had better Chinese food at Panda express,  but the service some how made up for the lack of wow in the food.   While the Fiesta Cafe won't be my first lunch option in Henderson,  it isn't off the table either."}
{"text":"I've been a regular at Cafe Fiesta since they changed from Denny's.  As many have said, the Asian Menu is an excellent surprise!  They recently changed some of the recipes for the Asian side and things are even better now.  I have heard also that they might be adding some additional Asian items.  The staff are, for the most part, extremely friendly and helpful. And one of the best things is that there's nothing on h menu over $10... they do have specials from time to time, and I've never heard of one of those (Like a Surf & Turf) that was over $13."}
{"text":"Worst service in the cafe ever. Henderson local, and for the past two years it has been the worst service ever. Most recent was tonight, went in, they set up our table, no one waiting to pay or be seated, then after setting our table, she starts taking people's bills without seating us. 6 people later, I finally ask if she is going to seat us. Even the manager was no help.  They were not busy, just lazy and not able to multi task."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! Server  Roderick slooooowwwww, got the order wrong too! Was there over an hour, asked the Manager Andy to help... He said NO... Don't put yourself through this... Don't go!"}
{"text":"The food was fine. The service was so great . Slow and did not refill drinks,or get condiments. Still left a 20% tip because it is a hard job. Maybe they will get better."}
{"text":"This place isn't that bad.  I wasn't feeling well and I wanted a bowl of chicken soup and a bowl of chicken soup was what I got.  My husband got a turkey sandwich.  I took a bite and found it to be tasty enough.  It was better than Subway but not as good as a grilled Panini at some fancier café.  I was happy with my order and the service, and the fact that it's 24 hours is a big plus.    If you're in the casino or in the area it isn't terrible.  You could do a lot worse."}
{"text":"We always come late night to eat! Usually after the gym to get those gains (; but we love coming here mostly because the graveyard shift staff is the epitome of customer service. Our favorites Melissa, Norma, & Richard are absolute peaches and we have become regulars with them. They always treat us with such kindness and make sure we are happy with our entire service. We love the food and late night conversations with them. (:"}
{"text":"We ordered the shrimp cocktail and it tastes like fake rubber shrimp. Do not waste your time at this place!"}
{"text":"According to my friend, this place inside the casino hotel Fiesta used to be Denny's. Now it is called Cafe Fiesta.  I am not too sure but I don't think they remodeled the place....it still looks like Denny's.   People are friendly.  The food is mediocre just like every other diner you see around but the price is not bad.  It is an option for you to dine late night when you get hungry during playing casino."}
{"text":"My husband and I stop by at least once a week. We have both ordered something different everytime we come. The service has always been very good. We have enjoyed all of the dishes we have ordered. Good food for a good price."}
{"text":"Friendly Service , Came Exclusively To Eat Country Chicken Fried Steak And This Is Now The 4Th And Last Time I Order It....My Dog Wouldn't Even Eat It...The Meat Used On My Chicken Fried Steak Wasn't Even Penetrable And It Was Like Chewing On Elastic.....Eventually Giving Up I Swallowed It Cause I Was Paying For It. The Buffet Was Not Open For Breakfast Unfortunately .....After Speaking With The Restaurant Manager To Discuss the Issue And All She Said We Will Try To Change It....Honestly They Should Remove That Item All Together ... Very Disappointed ...No Compensation :( On The Other Hand My Buddy Loved His Prime Steak Omelette.... I Wish He Would Have Shared With Me :/"}
{"text":"Initially confused about hearing the Cafe Fiesta... having thought the restaurant being referenced was Denny's.  When I sowed up I understood what was being talked about.  After arriving, the menu was found to be pretty basic with an additional Asian menu added on the sign.  Sadly, I did not pay attention to see what it offered because I had burgers on the brain and a blue cheese and bacon burger was ordered.  When the meal arrived, my request for medium well was apparently rejected and I received charcoal.  The fresh bun and veggies made up for it and I decided to make a big deal out of it. The fires come in it's very own little fry basket.  Given the limited menu (Asian not withstanding) I might only eat here again if I needed to kill a buzz."}
{"text":"Quick to be seated. But, server took a long time to take our order and it wasn't even busy. Ordered the Country Skillet $6.99. Everything was good except for the hash browns. Wished they cooked it a little longer.  Mine was soggy."}
{"text":"They get one star since asst manager was at least nice when she wouldn't take crap Huevos Ranceros off the bill.  Took one bite. Go to buffet instead much better and faster.   Took forever to get bad food. But they'll try to make it right?  Pass."}
{"text":"Nice remodel of this place. Looks so new even their open kitchen has new equipment. We usually come here for late night breakfast. It's never too busy, their Graveyard crew is always friendly.   Graveyard Breakfast menu super cheap.  Steak and Eggs listed at $5.99.. and that was the highest priced dish on there.   Got your basic bacon eggs and shared a huge bowl of biscuits and gravy.  The portions are just right especially for the price.  My dish was great.  Can't screw up breakfast.   Helpful and attentive staff.. even the Keno runner off duty acknowledged us.   Fist bump to server who gave us boarding pass discount even though we didn't have our card.   In and outta there in less than an hour spent less than fifteen bucks for the two of us. And cool beans I have no kitchen mess to clean up! Gotta love decent places to eat open 24/7!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced good eats.  Attentive service and friendly staff.   Counter seats available. Open 24 hrs!"}
{"text":"It is okay.  12.99 all you can eat unless you sign up for the boarding pass then it is 8.99   Service for drinks was very slow.  This was at dinner time. Planned on going all week. I might try it again for lunch but I don't think so."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place was pretty damn good at midnight. I had a French dip and it was juicy and good for the most part. Now I would like to try this place in the daytime."}
{"text":"Tried this place once, was not impressed with food or service - would have given it 2 stars.  Decided to give it another shot but between the two I can't give more than 1 star.  It took almost 40 minutes to get our breakfast orders (ham and eggs, eggs benedict).  My eggs benedict was cold.  Not just lukewarm, but actually cold.  When I finally flagged the waitress down to ask for a new one, she seemed to not be able to understand what I was saying and called her manager.  I told the manager my food was cold and she took it to the kitchen and told me she'd be right out with a replacement.  Ok, no problem.  Until 20 minutes later and my husband was done with his meal (since I was starving by this time and shared his) and I still hadn't gotten my food.  I would have just cancelled the order had I been able to get someone's attention to tell. By the time I got my order (over an hour since we'd arrived), we were running late and needed to leave.  The manager was upset that I told her I no longer wanted the meal and only very reluctantly took it off the bill.    If this was my first experience here, I wouldn't give a review like this until I tried it again.  But this second try was our first visit all over again, just magnified.  The only good thing about the place are the prices - eat here if you are seriously on a budget and have lots and lots of time and patience."}
{"text":"I am so mad because I forgot to take pictures of the food. But I must say the food itself was good. I got the chicken wings and asked for them extra crispy, and indeed they did make them  the proper way and they were delicious. My husband had the BLT sandwich, and he claimed it was good. We shared fries but I must say if we didn't eat them fast they tasted like they were frozen which is fine but I rather have that at home and not at a café. The waitress we had was not the friendliest but not the rudest either. She made me feel that I was taking her time and I should hurry and figure out what I want to order. The place is clean but I feel like it's a little too pricey to be a café. I would recommend this place just beware that the waitress might make you feel like you're bothering her. One last thing, I felt like it took too long for us to get our food. So if you do what we were trying to do and that was to eat before our movie, make sure you go with plenty of time or you will be forced to eat fast so you don't miss your movie."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. This place was not only far from decent, the service was horrible. There was a complaint about the taste of the french toast and the manager handled it very poorly. I won't be returning here again."}
{"text":"SOS DD! Same old sh_ _ Different Day! Caked on food on the fork and food and trash on the floors at the booth we were taken to! Just nasty! Makes you feel you're sitting in a trash can! Salt and Pepper Wings were tasteless! The Fisherman's Platter was lacking as it was just 3 over -battered cod pieces and tiny fried shrimp, fries, and coleslaw. Great service from Susan! I spoke with the new 7-days on the job manager to show him their shortcomings. I wished him good luck with keeping up with everything!"}
{"text":"Visited this establishment on 10-31. I do have to say this was the 3d time we had a bad experience. The waitress (will not name) was not very friendly at all. Requested 2 times for side dish, the garlic fries must have been under the heat lamp for at least 20 minutes....... Just very disgusted with the entire meal. I sincerely hope that the General Manager of the Cafe pulls the entire staff together and works on their issues.. Will not be returning anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Went here the other morning with a handful of coworkers. I decided to get the French toast and it was OK which is basically what I expected from this restaurant so no hard feelings there. However, the server had an issue when attempting to split our bills. I know it's difficult when we have six people at a table and ask for separate checks but she agreed to do it and she thought that she accomplished it. However, she ended up having some issues with it and we needed to go to the cashier to have it resolved. We stood at the front of the restaurant for about 10 minutes attempting to have the manager work through the issue with the checks. We weren't in any particular rush so again, no big deal. However, at about minute 11, the manager got so frustrated with it that he told me 'it's just $26', eluding to the fact that I should just pay for it as opposed to splitting the check. Uhhh, no- that's not how me and my coworkers do things so that's not what I want to do. Further, he said 'I need to leave for the airport' and grabbed his belongings and left.  I ended up just paying for it all on my card and no big deal but it was handled poorly and I didn't appreciate it."}
{"text":"Breakfast was great and reasonable, Banana Foster Frenchtoast was very good, and the turkey club looked to be excellent, nothing like using discount coupons!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and fast service, our waitress hands and finger nails dirty. The floor was dirty with paper all over. One would think for Graveyard shift and everyone standing around they could keep the place clean. Although the food was good and cheap I don't think we will be back, not worth getting sick over . I think it's time for the Health Dist to do a inspection."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for.  Looking for a cheap late night 4 am breakfast? This is the place. You have their boarding pass or whatever their casino card is called, it's a complete deal. I go their 2 eggs, hash browns, toast, and bacon deal for I believe $5. Can't beat that.   Will I come back if I'm in the area in the middle of the night looking for a bite to eat? Sure. Will I go out of my way? Absolutely not."}
{"text":"Well....here we go again!  Tried the Cafe at the Fiesta Henderson again.  Our waiter was named Richard....and he was fantastic!!!!!!  Couldn't ask for better service!  We ordered the chicken eggrolls and Emperor's Chinese Soup.  And it was unbelievably delicious!!!!  It wasn't salty....all the chicken, pork and shrimp and wontons were cooked perfectly!!!!  I can't wait to go back and have this soup on a cold day!  It was better than most high end oriental restaurants.  So...whoever is cooking the oriental food on Oct. 9, 2014 at about 3pm....knows what they're doing in a kitchen!  And the eggrolls were awesome as usual!  And thanks to our server Richard....he made it an enjoyable experience from beginning to end!  :)  Thanks Richard :)"}
{"text":"Swell place for a cheap, hearty breakfast. Huge upgrade over the crappy Denny's that used to rent the space."}
{"text":"Apparently, Stations Casino (Owner of the Fiesta) has other plans for this space because they have put no effort into making the restaurant work.  Slow service from start to finish.  I mean 90 minutes for two people to get seated, order a simple meal each, have it delivered to our table (cold) and getting to pay for it.  It was not a busy night and plenty of tables were open.  I ordered simple cheeseburger and fries, wife ordered similar.  Nothing fancy.  Saw the waitress maybe three times and literally had to block her path once to get  her attention.  I would have stopped to complain to management, but at the rate of service, I would still be there waiting."}
{"text":"No more Dennys, but the Station Casino group has modernized the old cafe.    The food is still Station Casino stuff, but the interior upgrades gave it a like more pizzazz, and the number of flat screen throughout the cafe won't let you miss a beat if you're watching ESPN.  Station has cutback on the wait help, but lucky for them, there a was great Cuban waitress who was serving eight different table, and was even busing them too.   I was very surprised because she was on top of of each customer, and none of the tables had no noticeable problems with her service.    Because of this waitress, I'm adding a star to this review."}
{"text":"For a casino hotel cafe the food was really good. I got the BBQ bacon burger (which was so juicy and grilled to perfection!) with sweet potato fries that were fried to crispity goodness. My boyfriend got the 3 course platter for 9.99 and chose the quesadilla, salisbury steak, and chocolate cake. The Salisbury steak was amazing, even the peas were good. I highly recommend this place. The prices were pretty cheap too, especially if you stay at the fiesta hotel and get it from midnight to 6am. The service was also really great."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had the blackened salmon dinner they came with a baked potato and green beans he had a side of chicken noodle soup and I had the dinner salad and for under $20 our dinner was fabulous."}
{"text":"Very bad experience on 7-30-2014.  Took two interns for lunch at the Cafe Fiesta.  It was Senior Wednesday.  One third of tables occupied-30 minute wait.  Told it was the kitchen staff.  Computer system down and cannot use points-cash only.  Online menu many more items than sit down menu.  $28.00 for meal-no senior discount with points.  Was told that is the way it is and I wasn't the only one affected.  Last visit for me."}
{"text":"Horrible. Place has gone downhill. Items are either overcooked or undercooked. Staff doesn't seem to care. Slow service."}
{"text":"I had a short overnight in Henderson. Driving in from Reno, we got to the hotel about 2:30 am. The only place to eat here at the Fiesta was this cafe.  We were quite hungry after a long 8 hr drive. So an empty cafe seemed like it would be quick to provide food/service. This was not the case.  We choose a booth to sit down. After a couple minutes of sitting there staring at any employee who walked by, we were greeted and handed menus. The waitress was pleasant, though seemed uninterested to be there.   We placed our order, 1 breakfast plate (2 eggs, sausage, hashbrowns), and 1 OJ for the hubby, I requested water only.  5 min later, we got our drinks. about 25 min after that we got our food. The food, was only ok. Eggs and hasbrowns are pretty hard to mess up. I was not a fan of the sausage at all. I only took one bite and left the rest.  There did not seem to be any speed other than SLOW for any of the workers. I do not understand this, as there were only 3 other patrons in the whole place. The occasional casino worker would come in and order food to come back 10 min later and receive their food.  Not a place that I would suggest for anyone who on any kind of time constraint. Perhaps it was just that we arrived at 2:30 am, but still. I expect better."}
{"text":"Sad to say I wasn't impressed with this place. We received a postcard coupon in the mail and while I don't usually fall for those, I was going to be near there anyway, so why not try it?  I was originally headed for the Mexican restaurant next door, but they weren't open yet and I only had limited time, so I went here and had the club sandwich, which was really disappointing. The meat was really 'gamey' tasting like it had been on the frig shelf a few days too long and the basket of fries was cold by the time we got it.  Because of the coupon, it was a cheap meal...so I shouldn't complain, I guess. But I can't say I'd go back...practically free or not."}
{"text":"Took 40 min to get our food wich included a salad ,pancakes &hamburger.the inexperience service was awful.the bun&meat was hard&could not be eaten.salad was missing half of ingredients &no refills.manager came over after calling her to tell her about the food & she did not apologize for anything.she brought a new hamburger with an attitude on the side.the check was never picked up.worst experience&disappointed because the cafe was long over due.no organization,no guest service, not coming back."}
{"text":"This is perfect for a 3.5 star review, I would have sided with 4 stars if the service was better but it wasn't.  The price is right, I do gamble a little at fiesta and get at least a couple of these free a month. The food is always decent, not great not bad but a good middle of the road. I just had the Chicken Fried Steak for the first time today and it was the best thing that I have had on their menu."}
{"text":"We have  been going to the Cafe Fiesta a couple of times per month lately, and it has not disappointed! We'd had some bad experiences over the years there (being ignored by waiters, getting seated slowly, stuff like that). Since Station Casinos started sending 2-for-1 coupons to the cafe again, we have started making it a habit. I am totally hooked on the turkey club sandwich with avocado and sweet potato fries-- it is the best club sandwich I have ever had anywhere. It's that good! My husband always varies what he has, and his food is consistently great too. The portions are super generous. They actually have a KENO runner in the cafe too (which you hardly see anywhere anymore). The servers are super friendly and efficient-- no complaints there. Since we gave them another try (after avoiding them for a long time), it has become one of our favorite places to eat a casual meal. If you haven't tried them lately, I'd suggest trying them. We love it there."}
{"text":"Cafe was surprisingly good. They had a great Asian menu. The food and service were excellent. First time staying at this hotel and didn't know that pets were allowed. I will never stay on the strip again."}
{"text":"Great portions for the price good selection of different food. Fast service. I like there sandwich's and Chinese food selections."}
{"text":"Not good, so sloooooowwww, F- all the way around. The place smells like dog pee also. Burnt eggs, and weird tasting hash browns,  fat and slow. night is ok"}
{"text":"I stopped by tonight to have my favorite combo fried rice and very disappointed that the plate got smaller and it does not look like it used to. The flavor is also not the same. What a shame that the quality of the food and the taste is not there anymore."}
{"text":"Very good food at very reasonable prices, problem is never enough employees, tons of empty tables and yet you always have to wait about 10 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"Located in the Fiesta Henderson, Ok so this will be a short and not so sweet. The food is ok, the service is less than ok. My water was never refilled, the waitress never came back to check on me, despite not being busy at all. I ordered the liver and onions, I had to call the waitress back to ask where the bacon was (The menu said that the liver and onions had bacon) She looked at me quizzically as if liver onions and bacon were some unheard of dish. I would make the extra trip to Sunset Station, GVR or the Bolder Strip before going back here. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Fiesta Henderson made the right decision to ditch Denny's a return to an in-house cafe, and Cafe Fiesta has more surprises than that. Cafe Fiesta is a win just on its very tasty Asian menu alone. I tried the walnut shrimp and could live off it. Actually one of the better cafes at a Station's I've been to.  For the budget-conscious, they make a point that everything is under $10. When Cafe Fiesta first opened a few months ago, the menu was pretty limited but has expanded greatly since then. Did I mention the Asian menu?"}
{"text":"My sister and I had lunch here and let me just say that if you know me, you know I'm ALL about good cheap food! I loved this cafe. It was very nice and clean and had a modern diner/cafe feel to it. The restaurant overlooks the casino and the rest of the hotel since it is elevated. I don't know why but it kind of reminded me of the Rain Forest Cafe LOL Anyway, everything on the menu is very reasonably priced. Most items are $10 & under -- they even have midnight specials priced between $1.99 - $5 which is pretty cool if you are in the casino and want a late night meal. Our waiter was very attentive and social - he did a good job. Our food was also very tasty - my sister ordered a breakfast plate and I had the orange chicken which was very good. Would definitely dine here again - 5 stars for ambiance, price and service! =)"}
{"text":"This ought to be one of my shortest reviews. One sentence summarizes the cafe, \"slower than molasses.\" This review describes the experience. This was going to be my post-hike dinner. I sat down in their cafe and ordered the shrimp and chicken off their $9.99 three choice menu. This is where you get an appetizer, entree, and dessert for the $9.99. Actually it's a gimmick because a few items are $9.99. The chicken and shrimp over rice is $10.99. Anyways price is irrelevant when your post-hike dinner is turning into tomorrow's pre-hike breakfast. I kept waiting and waiting on the mushroom soup what seemed like several red light cycles at Charleston and Decatur. It seemed that if, and I write IF the soup ever arrived that it would be at the same time as my entree. So, I threw in the towel and walked out.      I am giving the Fiesta Cafe two stars in lieu of one for a couple of reasons. The post hike dinner I had in the winter of 2014 was good. The server's attitude was okay. Then again I only saw her once. Additionally I did have a couple of sips of the cola.      Cafe Fiesta is two stars which calls for a six month suspension. It's just a shame that I am now very hungry after hours of hiking in Valley of Fire."}
{"text":"My wife's go to meal when feeling under the weather is scrambled eggs and toast and this rendition was well executed.  My Cobb salad was the worst I have ever experienced.  Each ingredient was chopped into morsels almost too small to recognize.  Nutritionally bankrupt iceberg lettuce was the primary ingredient, the chicken was overcooked and the dressing was virtually tasteless.  Thankfully it was senior day so I was only charged  1/2 points."}
{"text":"I had some of their late meals and it was very good value. $1.99 for a 2-egg/hashbrowns, toast. $4.99 for Sweet/Sour Chicken. I like the vibe and just hanging out having late meals was a treat here."}
{"text":"Food here is good. Very reasonable prices. Friendly, quick service. This is a great 24/7 cafe, definitely reccomended!"}
{"text":"Oh my God. I rarely ever Rave about a cafe inside of a casino, but this one deserves 5 Stars. The food is off the hook amazing! I had pancakes two mornings in a row, and they were the best pancakes I ever had, next to Caesars Palace pancakes! And then I had an omelette the third day, and it was out of this world! Their food is very very good and I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Dirty nasty place! Food will make you sick! Absolutely disgusting! My boyfriend and I split a nacho, we were so sick the next day we couldn't even leave our hotel room! 3 days later still sick! This place ruined our time with their UNSANITARY FOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"2 stars for this place cause food was mediocre and the service was just awful.   Service: Sat down for 7 mins at the counter with like 6 staff in front of me without a greeting or offer of a drink. Gail got my order wrong and there were no utensils given until I had to ask for them. Never asked or offered drink refill. Gail seemed rude and rushed to go.   Food: I got the 2 egg 2 meat with toast and hash breakfast. Order was wrong since I asked for sausage and got bacon. Asked for potatoes instead of hash. They were dry, over-cooked and tasteless. My eggs we ok if you skip the part of having egg shells in them.  Place is terrible from staff to food. Only came cause I had a coupon but I will be going back to Sunset from now on."}
{"text":"Two words to perfectly sum up this place; slow and greasy. My chicken tenders had bread the ran off it when touched by anything, because of the amount of grease covering the chicken. To be kind I asked for a to go box and when I went to box the chicken, the bread literally slid right off like a old used condom. Not only was the chicken greasy but it was also chewy. This greasy hard cold chicken was the things that make up your child's nightmares. Waiting and watching for the perfect moment to rip a black hole where your buttocks is located. Seriously, I only ate one of them before giving in to the pain that was already turning in my gut. Not only was the food unbearable but I waited over fourth five minutes for the worst food I have had in months. I will never be eating here again."}
{"text":"We had real good service till I went up to pay and didn't hear our waitress tell us she would take it up for us.... Opps, sorry didn't hear you!!! Would of tipped her 20 percent but because of her getting a attitude with me for not hearing her I tipped her 15 percent... Not everyone hears well!!! I couldn't believe how she changed her attitude.. Maybe, she thought I wasn't going to tip her.  I always tip.. I tip on my service I get..."}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday night and ordered off of their late night specials. We ordered  1. All-nighter breakfast, 1.99 2. classic burger and fries, 2.99 for 6.38  - This is a great place for your midnight munchies. Compared to the Grand Cafe's in other Station Casinos. This spot is clean and rarely filled with drunks.  - The Grand Cafe is a better alternative than Denny's. It's cheaper. As long as you have a boarding pass, you are in the clear.  - The only reason why it's not a 5 star is because I prefer going to Coronado Cafe at South Point. Although this place has steak and eggs for 5.95, they got the same thing but for 3.95! haha.  - Service is simple. We got our food quickly. Jonathan was a pleasant dude.  - All-night breakfast was simple. Quick late night craving satisfied.  - Classic burger and fries were also simple. No frills. If you are craving a hamburger, I'd say it's a better alternative than the Jack in the Box that is off of Gibson.  - Overall, amazing place to dine when the cravings hit and you have time to sit and relax."}
{"text":"Wow!  Sat at the counter. Got my food rather quickly because I ordered the pasta and chicken special. Found a large onion skin in it. Waitresses (not waiter, he was quiet) were nasty to each other. Kitchen understaffed. Manager ignored waitstaff.  Which caused more frustration among them. One customer got up and left. Not impressed with my first visit.    Need to dress up the Pesto Chicken and pasta dish. A little plain needs maybe a couple of sliced mini tomatoes on top.    I was fortunate. I had a very nice waitress. Her name is Shante. She deserves to work at a nicer place with nicer co-workers."}
{"text":"Good spot if you are looking for reasonably priced meals in the area and some variety on the menu.  They have an Asian menu available for dinner that is separate from the regular menu.  I've eaten both breakfast and dinners here.  I've found both equally decent options."}
{"text":"sad to say i should have heeded the waitress. the hong kong noodles was the worst. not only extra crispy, you could bang it against the table without breaking. too much ginger, lots of sugar.  fire the cook or whoever designed the leather food. the servers were very nice."}
{"text":"I ordered the All American Breakfast. It came with four pancakes that covered the plate. My three eggs and four sauauce patties came on a separate plate.   Let's just say that I asked for a carry out box/bag, taking home two pancakes, one sauauce Patty, and some eggs home with me.  JP From Henderson, Nevada  28 August 2016"}
