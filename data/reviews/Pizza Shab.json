{"text":"I got the mix pizza. The dough was thick, crispy outside and chewy inside, the cheese was amazing, the toppings were fresh, non-salty and very generous. In love."}
{"text":"I don't write a lot of reviews, but this one i had to do. I used to be a usual here, but then i changed my location. but i went back today and it was the same people, and same excellent quality. Much better than franchise pizza, or even most of the terroni pizzas. It's rich and delicious, and there's no lack of toppings. The have a smoked chicken pizza which is soo good. and they have what they call snack, which is hard to eat, and sometimes there's not enough napkins around but it's irresistible. unfortunately they don't deliver but they cater or if you call them earlier they told me they'll prepare it so that u can pick up and go. Felt like it deserves a review here, considering that with all the competition it's getting from the neighborhood they have stick to the same high quality stuff they used to. I'll definitely stop by again when in the neighborhood or may be i'll just order pick up!"}
{"text":"The food is fairly cheap price-wise (8.99) the quality also is much higher than typical pizza novas or pizza pizza 
but for a persian pizza place, I was not impressed. I was expecting a much better food."}
{"text":"It's Expensive and does not offer dine in. Not like real Persian pizza but it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Walked in without really knowing what to order but the guy at the till was really helpful explaining what's what. We ordered the beef lovers. The wait wasn't too long and food was great."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Got the Beef Lovers Pizza with Angus steak strips, smokey beef jambon, Persian beef sausage, cheese and veggies.  Had to take a side pic because most of the meat is stuffed inside.  A large pizza came out to $30 but it was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite Iranian pizza place in Toronto. Ordering time takes long almost always."}
{"text":"I've been walking by Pizza Shab for months and calling it \"Night Pizza\" because the sign on their window actually says \"Late Night Fast Food\" instead of the restaurant name. But if you're looking for something other than the usual pizza place, you should definitely try Pizza Shab.  The pizza reminds me of Pizza Hut deep dish pizza, but less greasy, and you get Persian toppings like Jambon (cold cuts) on your pizza.  A small size pizza is 7\" and actually more of a personal-size pizza, and costs around $6.49-$7.49 depending on toppings.  Maybe a little more expensive compared to chain pizza joints, but you're getting a different style of pizza here, plus it's made fresh when you order it.  And definitely not more expensive than Pizza Hut.

Inside the place there are only a few tables, so I would consider it more of a take-out place.  If you do get take-out, it's better to call in your order first because it takes awhile to make the pizza.

The best part about Pizza Shab is that they are open late (obv) and it just has that feel of somewhere that you go to grab a snack in the middle of the night."}
{"text":"pizza sucks. end of story. Reviews are all fake for all the other locations. Same people reviewing all the locations.  AMIN BEN TINA. OR DO ALL OF THEM DRIVE TO ALL THE LOCATIONS AND SAY ITS THE BEST..?"}
{"text":"The best Iranian style pizza...their pizza always tastes good with the same quality. 

The place is very small so I never feel comfortable to sit in their store and eat there!"}
{"text":"Best Persian pizza in Toronto. Their quality is pretty good compared to other persian pizzas in Town and also Their service is great and they always welcome you with a smile unlike other persian restaurants which service is usually not the greatest."}
{"text":"You think I would not try your food and rate this place?  I would rather eat a  road kill skunks fecal orifice.  You seem so defensive.  I never said your food is frozen.  But now that you mention it, I'd rather eat a frozen load of camel feces  than try your food again. PATOOEY! Your place is amazing averaging 1 star.  Look at all the amazing reviews Mr Pizza Shab.  I think you misspelled the last two letters of Sh \"ab\" and it should be sh \"it\".  I welcome you to respond to this review."}
{"text":"The place is very cozy and small. It's too small that no more than a group of 6 people can fit in at the same time.The pizza has a super nostalgic taste of Persian pizza which is great. The price is a bit expensive for the food they provide. But for all the Iranians who miss the taste of Persian pizza, this is the place to try!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. I'd definitely recommend giving this place a shot. Took a little longer than they said to get my order. The dinning area is extremely small and congested, so eating there was not an option. Also since the whole place is so tiny, it gets super hot in the dinning area especially in the summer. All that heat has nowhere to go and is coming right from the kitchen. I was sweating away just standing there placing my order."}
{"text":"Best Persian Pizza I could find in Toronto. Try the Special Pizza tasted great! Their special white sauces are delicious!"}
{"text":"Iranian pizza as I remember it! Definitely took me back to my childhood. I am only giving it a 4/5 because I paid for got charged for the Ketchup which would have been just fine had it been Iranian ketchup but instead I got 6 packages of no brand regular ketchup. You may thing it's not a big deal but Iranian ketchup tastes different and is impossible to find in Canada. FYI Iranian pizza does not have tomato sauce and so you typically add ketchup on top. All that being said, would order it again!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Persian style pizza, must try if you have not already! Small size looks tiny but easily fills one person. Don't forget to add their awesome white and hot sauces!"}
{"text":"The rating is solely based on the quality of the pizza: Generous amount of toppings, extra cheesy, hot and fresh. You can get corn as a topping and the herbs added on top is absolutely fantastic. I recommend the special and supreme. Unfortunately, the place has limited seating, so your best bet is to order in advance for pick up."}
{"text":"It was descent pizza . We got the supreme and the special . The quality was okay could be much much better . It was too dry and not well seasoned . Hopefully next time we will have better experience ."}
{"text":"It is a friendly and comfortable environment with a fairly delicious pizza. They are overpriced but worth trying especially if you have no other options and hungry late night. As a  regular customer, this is my second review as i have noticed slight increase in the price and reduction in the quality and quantity of toppings and ingredients of the  pizza."}
