{"text":"Excellent food and service, highly recommend the Walleye! The atmosphere is great with their nautical theme.  I also recommend the fried mushrooms.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Brennan's is really good. The hand cut fries are delicious and so is the cole slaw. The perch and walleye are also very good. Fresh and tasty. I had the broiled seafood platter and it's just like I remember the seafood places on the East Coast as a kid. Is is a cute kitschy place with extremely nice servers and owners. I visit here every time I come home from Chicago.  It's very affordable too."}
{"text":"We had a party of 7, the first person arrived at 5:50 PM and left her name with the hostess and was told a 30 minute wait. At 7:00 PM I asked the hostess how much longer, Her reply \"I don't know.\"  If your hungry or in a hurry go someplace else. I did."}
{"text":"Visited there on a Tues evening for the first time and found a great atmosphere and really good food.  We planned to go back for more clam chowder and perch!

My boss requested this for his retirement lunch, and I had good perch again!

So... I figured my dad would love this place (he's a fan of Jake's on the Lake in Avon), and we had a large group go again.  Good food again and the meals were served promptly.  There can be a wait sometimes to get seated!

Overall, if you like fried fish, this is a good place to get it!  There's lots more on the menu though.  I was excited to find fried clams, as most places don't offer these anymore!  YUM, they were good.

There is a casual atmosphere with a fishing dock feel to the decoration.  I believe this place is cheaper than Pickle Bills, and it lacks the crazy and sometimes risque decor of Pickle Bills.

Ladies bathroom pass inspection.  They are very vigilant about not seating a party until all are present regardless of when the reservation is made... almost to the point of weirdness like counting us.  I'd still go back!  Remembering this is making me hungry for fish!

I successfully subbed my fries for chowder with a small upcharge; totally worth it in my opinion since everyone else usually cannot finish their fries and I can taste a few donated ones!  :)"}
{"text":"Great food, large portions, excellent service! Much more bang for your buck than Pickle Bill's, half the price and the food is just as good!"}
{"text":"Great old school seafood restaurant. Super Clam Strip are indeed \"Super\".  Between myself and the rest of the family, we had a sampling of perch, walleye, catfish, shrimp, scallops and clam strips.  Everyone loved their food. Also, the apple sauce was a hit with those who had it. Service was great too. Definitely a spot to visit."}
{"text":"I love seafood. My family and I went to early dinner here at 4pm. I got the crab cakes and they were the best crab cakes I have ever had in my short 25 years. The fried walleye was delicious as well. The service was a little slow, but not too much to ruin the experience. Would definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Brennan's is not masquerading as anything but what it is. They do fish, and they do it well!

My husband and I split the New England clam chowder and the perch and walleye combo. The clam chowder was okay. Honestly, it tasted very similar to the canned stuff you can get at the grocery. I wouldn't order it again. The fried clam appetizer was tasty, as well as the perch and walleye. Fries were greasy and delicious. The highlight was definitely the walleye.

All in all, if you're looking for laid-back atmosphere, fish and beer, you've found the place."}
{"text":"Food o.k., service o.k.  will need to try it once more before I'm certain if I want to make this a frequent stop.  Fries were not greasy though.  Not much to rave about, but will go back once more and try something different from the menu."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy. A bit noisy. Somewhat of a senior citizen crowd. But the cajan catfish and crab cakes are really delicious. If it's winter and you get there before 5:00 you might have a good chance of sitting next to a toasty fire. Did I mention the creamy cole slaw and tasty clam chowder soup? Ever been to Tangier Island? Always reminds me of Fisherman's Corner there. Same black and white tile floor - just not as much slant!! Definitely on our \"must return\" list."}
{"text":"The clam chowder is served piping hot and is thick and creamy. The French fries are what you would find on the boardwalk in ocean city, but better! They are delicious. I've been here twice recently and the first visit I got the platter that had quite an assortment, perch, crab cakes, shrimp, scallops, whitefish. It was excellent. On our second visit, I got the breaded perch dinner. It was so good from the platter that I decided I had to get the whole perch meal and my mouth is watering now thinking of it. 
The prices are decent, the selection of appetizers are decent, the size of the restaurant is decent, the wait staff is decent. The taste of the food is absolutely scrumptious! 
Brennan's has been around forever and they know how to cook Lake Erie perch!"}
{"text":"the mussels for appetizer is spot on!:) so hearty and yummy!!:) i got the sea food platter for my entree and i chose to have it sauteed in their \"heart healthy\" way-- a big NO NO!! omg!! it was horrendous!!  all of the seafood served in this heart healthy platter is swimming in atleast 3 sticks of butter!! i won't get it again.. never! im just thankful my appetizer is really good.."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Went for business lunch had great service, food was fresh and delicious.  The perch was on point and the hamburger was well prepared.  Stop in, leave full, and enjoy the friendly faces."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the atmosphere, staff and the Lake Perch/Walleye combo. It's the place you crave when you're by the lake."}
{"text":"Well, where do I begin!  Situated way back off of busy Heisley road, this quaint little restaurant will have you hooked before you even enter!  This location is much smaller and quieter in compared to the largeness of Pickle Bill's directly across the street, but do not fear - you're in for a great treat a Brennan's!  

Upon entering, you will feel like you're dining in someone's cozy little lake house.  The decor is slightly old, but totally inviting and the wood floor and paneling only eludes warmth and comfort.  Beware that the seating is pretty tight - you're almost a little up close and personal with those dining next to you, but for some reason I never get the feeling of being claustrophobic or uncomfortable - it almost adds to the allure if you ask me (maybe I'm just weird like that)!  If you can get past this, then you'll be happy you did because your cozy little dinner will only get better once you dive into the delicious food!

I've eaten at Brennan's quite a bit, and I can honestly say I've never been disappointed with my meal.  You get that home cooked kind of feel, and for me nothing gets better than that!  My two recommendations for food are these: the fresh sea scallops in the special garlic sauce (holy cow I think I could eat 10 lbs of these - that is if I had a spare 10 lbs to gain! - oh and I suggest the garlic sauce on EVERYTHING!) and the crab legs - TOTALLY delicious, TOTALLY messy, and TOTALLY worth it (you can't beat the price!)  

If you're looking for a comfortable dining environment with great seafood (oh and they have turf options too for those of you who aren't big fans of those sea creatures) then check out Brennan's!!"}
{"text":"First and foremot, ignore the hacks like Foodie P. I am not a seafood fan generally. I went with othets who are and I loved it. They had Jambalaya on the menu and it was warm and tasty and just spicy enough. The fish fans loved the Perch and jaddock meals. Tried it a decond time and had shrimp and it was great also. Worth a trip for a good meal all the time"}
{"text":"If you have no taste buds left, then this the place for you. I find the food in this place to be plain and tasteless. The primary crowd that this restaurant attracts are your senior citizens. This why the senior likes this place, because the taste buds on their tongues are pretty much gone. 

I ordered strip steak medium rare with crab legs. The steak was tasteless and was cooked well done.  The crab legs were OK.  Side dishes were just plain and simple. 

We didn't say anything about our meals to the manager, because we're not the right customers for this restaurant. We're not in 70+ crowd, plus like we ever come back to it. Maybe 30 years from now when our taste buds are no longer intact. Where we put salt on everything before tasting our food."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 30 years.  Enjoy the atmosphere and the menu.  My favorite order is the fish chowder.  I must say in the past year or two it has become more of a vegetable chowder compared to years past.  Still tasty but very little fish.  I would re name it vegetable chowder and we can add fish if you want.  Just very disappointed.   Hope to see it have more fish."}
{"text":"Love this place. Outstanding restaurant been getting the perch n walleye here for decades best in the area!"}
{"text":"I have had many great meals at Brennan's.  My whole family loves the food at this restaurant and whenever we have out of town guest we take them to Brennan's.  The perch and walleye are my favorites, but I like the crab cakes also. I can say I have never had a bad meal here. The french fries are delicious, just like old fashioned fair fries. The nautical atmosphere is truly unique.  Definitely not a chain type place, just a good old fashioned well run restaurant."}
{"text":"After seeing the rave reviews on Yelp, I took my parents to Brennan's specifically for the perch. My dad had a low sugar episode and the waitress was right on it-bringing a giant glass of orange juice. Kudos to her. I enjoyed the lake house motif, but our table was sticky (Pet peeve), most of the chairs were wobbly and the decor seemed a bit junky. The food was ok to good. Mom's walleye was tasty but a bit burnt. My perch was good, but on the cold side. The fries were very good and the cole slaw acceptable. The prices are kind of high for what you get. Overall, our server was great, the food was slow to come out and the fish was acceptable but a bit overpriced. Will try Pickle Bills next time."}
{"text":"Nope nope nope nope nope !   If you check out my other reviews you will see I try to be fair and positive in my reviews and I cannot for the life of me see how this place gets more than 1 or 2 stars !!  My husband had the catfish and it was So Bad !  It tasted..... Dirty.  He tried, he really did but it seemed that it wasn't cleaned or it was old or something bad.  I tasted it and immediately had to stop myself from gagging !  Seriously people this was gross.
The bread they serve is tasteless and beyond dull ( hush puppies would've been better ) .
I had the shrimp because they had no clamstrips...??!!   Nothing, absolutely nothing was even close to being good.
The atmosphere is good, the right kind of décor etc....   But we will never be back....ever.  YUCK"}
{"text":"This place is a local treasure. If want traditional American fish, fresh cooked, this is your place. This is a straight up fisherman's pub. It isn't trendy, but it's awesome. Pro tip: Make sure you try the crab cake."}
{"text":"Amazing we got the fisherman's platter & it was amazing with real scallops! It's pretty hard to find real scallops in the Midwest haha.  The meal is only 22$ and fed myself, my fiancé, and my son! Plus we still had food to take home! The food was also out to us within 10 minutes! Definitely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service in the free world! Not only do a bunch of backwoods hillbillies work there but they run the place as well. You would think with such competition as Pickle Bill's across the street, they would step up their game.... They don't, they can't and most likely never will. It's a shame that their food isn't worth the bull you have to put up with. Save your money and your appetite for Pickle Bill's. That is a place that knows how to treat customers as well as give you great food!!! You suck Brennan's ( smiling sweetly)"}
{"text":"I'm only in the area 2 or 3 times a year, but I always make a point to eat at Brennan's when I'm here. Amazing fresh lake fish, especially the perch. Plus the meals are huge. Great value, great service and even better food."}
{"text":"I usually stop by Brennan's at least once while I'm in town for business. The atmosphere is really cool..there's a lot of old fishing equipment and pictures all over the place. It's a true 'Fish House'. They specialize in the local fish that are in Lake Erie such as perch and walleye. Every time I go there I get the perch. Usually big-sized and fresh. They always give you a good quantity of food too. Most of their dishes come with fries and they give you a huge amount. Overall it's a good place to visit if you're in town. It has a 'staple in the community' vibe to it."}
{"text":"Can't beat Brennan's for a good fish dinner.  The Lake Erie perch and walleye dinners are outstanding.  Their French fries are excellent as well.  The atmosphere is like a New England seafront restaurant.  Always a local favorite place."}
{"text":"The food was very good. Looks like it could be busy in the summer.  In the winter it was very quiet."}
{"text":"While visiting Cleveland took my mother to Brennan's for her birthday since she loves shrimp.  Wanted somewhere that had good seafood without the pretentious atmosphere, Brennan's fit the bill.  Brennan's provides that fresh off the peer laid back atmosphere.  There was a mix of customers seemed there were locals and individuals who just finished boating for the day and several newbies.
I had the shrimp scampi linguine.  It was good could have used a bit more seasoning but it was a good sized portion and the shrimp were man sized shrimp, actually took about half home.  My wife had the lake perch and I tried it, cook to perfection and seasoned well.  Heard the perch and walleye are their specialty.  My daughter had the crab legs, well seasoned and a nice portion.  My mother had the salad with shrimp and she loved it and took over half home. The calamari was good and not over cooked like most places.

So let's summarize man sized portions and good seafood (lake perch, walleye) can't miss.  The atmosphere was laid back and the service was great as we had a large party, Tim was great. Prices were on par or lower than the big chain seafood restaurants."}
{"text":"Our party of 5 was visiting Fairport Harbor for the Tall Ship Festival.  We were so looking forward to eating at a local Seafood Restaurant when we arrived at Brennan's we were told the wait would be a half hour which of course wasn't a problem.  Well, after waiting 55 minutes we went back inside and were told the wait was an additional hour.  When I asked why were told only a half hour upon arrival I got the the deer in the headlight look from the male hostess.  I told him he could remove our name for the list and his reply was WHATEVER!  How sad that you are no longer valued as a customer especially by small business owner's like this."}
{"text":"We decided we wanted seafood for dinner tonight and our usual fair at Red Lobster was out of the question since the service and the food quality have gone down hill.  We looked on yelp at reviews and found Brennan's and thought why not.

What a fantastic choice we made.  We got there and it was hopping busy and they told us it would be 40 minutes but we lucked out and it was only about 15 minutes.  Our waiter came and got our drink order immediately and was very friendly and you could tell he loved his job.  He took our order and he was just very quick with everything, however he did not rush us.

The food was awesome.  It was seasoned perfectly for me, my husband needed just a smidge of salt in his chowder.  I can not wait to come back again and try other menu items so that I can find what will become my favorites.  We managed to split a dessert called a chocolate spoon cake....OMG this is a chocolate nightmare.  Ladies if you need a chocolate fix this is definitely your way to get it.  It will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I have nothing to compare it to but we really enjoyed the perch and walleye. Being from the South this was the first and only time my wife and I had eaten either fish. The restaurant is a typical beach community-type seafood restaurant, at least the type we are used to finding on beach trips. We went mid-afternoon on a Saturday and it was not busy at all. I liked that I was able to order Great Lakes beer. I recommend for the atmosphere, the food and the beverage if in the area."}
{"text":"Went to eat here on Saturday 2/28/15 and I have to disagree with the reviews. The food was just average if not bland for some people in our party.  I had the stuffed shrimp & they had the walleye, both lacked any real flavor.  The wait between our drink order being delivered and getting to place food was also about 1/2 hour, we eventually had to ask a busser to get our waiter.  I wouldn't recommend or go back."}
{"text":"A really nice place on the grand river. The place features fresh Lake Erie Pearch... there are also some other amazing items on the Menu like Giant Sea Scallops and Crab Cakes."}
{"text":"Overall this place is a quaint bar type establishment...I wouldn't go above that.  Now the food was fresh, hot and yummy - the fries delicious as other review cited - I didn't notice the \"greasy\" that people say tho.  

I had popcorn shrimp (so tasty!), my husbands crab cake was ok he said - the fried perch & walleye we shared - delicious! Server was nice but a lil inattentive. 

Next time we will eat at the bar :-)"}
{"text":"Ask for a side of the garlic sauce no matter what you order. It's good on everything. Solid perch and a crab cake like they mean it. Rustic. Nice areal pics of the area. Felt very local. Nice staff."}
{"text":"My family loves this restaurant.  The chowder is excellent.  My husband loves the perch and I love the baked white fish.  My son is a grilled cheese connoisseur and he loves their grilled cheese.  I love the quaint decor.  They have ample close parking."}
{"text":"So we wandered in here on a Monday around 7. We realize the kitchen closes at 8/8:30, so we had our orders pretty ready to go before we got there. Based on the yelp reviews and online menus I knew what not to get. We sat ordered waters and my boyfriend got a can of coke. For some reason our server, short haired red head, came back 5 minutes later without our drinks, asking for our orders. We started to order and my boyfriend asked what kind of raw oysters they had. Our server, no name given, started to argue with him quickly that she didn't understand what he meant, and made him feel like he was an idiot because they had raw oysters, or fried oysters, both from Virginia. *eye rolls and sighs* ended up throwing up her hands and quickly walking away, to consult the kitchen. (still no order in, or drinks on the table)  She comes back, with drinks, and promptly apologizes, realizing how rude she was. Still same story about the raw or fried oysters from Virginia, talking to him like he doesn't understand. After he rattles off 4 or so types of oysters she says, \"oh yeah those, the ones with the w!\" Okay great. We order clam chowder, which was amazing! Crab cake, raw oysters, fried oysters, Asian salad, stuffed orange roughy (me), and surf and turf (his). Crab cake was good, canned or imitation crab meat, it seemed like, but good. The raw oysters were enormous and served with cocktail sauce. Very disappointing! The fried oysters were better, probably because they were disguised in batter and fried, also served with cocktail sauce. The Asian salad, which I specifically ordered because it said it had \"mixed greens\". It was bagged iceberg lettuce with the little carrot and purple cabbage baggy scattered throughout. Another disappointment. Between the time she cleared our almost full appetizer and salad plates, without asking if anything was wrong with the food we hadn't eaten, she dropped off the butter candle for my boyfriends crab legs. By the time our dinners had arrived it was burned. She also never asked him about his sides for his $35 dinner so we got the wrong ones and dinners without bread and butter, which is also supposed to be on our table. She ran away from the table so fast we had to ask her for something every time she came back, which is annoying to do to a server, but at the initial food check we knew everything we needed. So she wasted her own energy. The fries, coleslaw, mashed potatoes and crab legs were good. My boyfriends steak was supposed to be medium rare. He cut into it and it was completely raw and purple in the center. So he caught our nameless server on one of her dashes away from our table and asked her to have them throw it back on, she brought it back about 7 minutes later. Set it down and walked away. I asked about a wine on the list on another stop with his second can of coke. She said that wine list was out of date and gave me a half ass list of house wines, I had to ask about Merlot before she remembered they had that too. I would have ordered a more expensive glass, but at this point we were clearly wasting her time, so I got what she could give me. My boyfriend cuts into his steak and it's exactly the same inside and we could tell the cook they have just threw it on the flattop and not a grill... He just set it to the side with no intention of trying again. She came back about ten minutes later he showed her the steak, and before apologizing, she gave us a sorry look, telling us there was nothing she could do, the kitchen was closed. He said he didn't want to try again, he just didn't want it. She took it and walked away, still no apology or remedy to our situation. My orAnge roughy was two pieces of fish sandwiched between a huge heap of crab cake salad stuffing. It was good, but quantity over quality for sure. She came back to see if we were ready for boxes, we just said yes. We saw they had banana cream pie and wanted to take some home, but opted to stop at the grocery store on the way home. She came back with the bill and said her manager took the steak off the bill, and that she would ask her to come talk to us if we wanted. The manager should have known to come over without having her incompetent server give us a half ass offer. We paid our $95 bill and left. She got a 12% tip which she didn't deserve, but we work in the industry and never leave even that small of a percentage. 
Overall: terrible service, terrible. Our server was un-attentive, rude, incompetent and entitled. The food was of poor quality and so was the cook. The manager didn't seem to care about keeping an eye on the way the restaurant was being run. This place should strictly serve fish frys, because they can't provide a decent seafood, or steak presentation  aside from that. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I was in search of a good seafood dinner, and this place fit the bill !   I was returning home from a road trip to Erie.  I, of course, consulted YELP for reference.  Brennan's did NOT disappoint.  I arrived at approx 4:30 on Friday, afternoon and the place was just starting to fill up.  I was seated toward the back, near the windows overlooking the river....which was nice.  The diners seated across from me, were happily enjoying their meals and after viewing their choices, portions etc., I knew that I had picked the right place!   I ordered a cup of the clam chowder for my starter and the shrimp platter for my entree.  The soup arrived right away, accompanied by a pack of oyster crackers.  The soup was warm, rich and delicious.  The soup was full of fresh clams and potatoes.  Shortly thereafter, my entree arrived along with a soft roll, and slice of rye bread with butter on the side.  The portion was huge.  6 perfectly fried, butterfly shrimp, along side a huge heap of handcut fries with a big scoop of creamy coleslaw.  I couldn't finish everything, probably because I started with the hearty clam chowder, but I finished what I could and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Fellow yelpers, I can always count on you to lead me to the best local spots, and you really came through on this one!

I don't get up north very often, so when I found myself in Mentor, Ohio on business the first thought that came to mind at dinner time was \"walleye\". It didn't take me long to discover Brennan's on yelp, and only about 2 miles from my hotel!

I visited on Monday night, and almost every table was occupied. The ambience felt as if I was in a New England fish house - lots of marine decor, lots of wood - arrgghhh! I noticed that many yelpers recommended the lake perch. I came in search of walleye. Brennans saved the day with their Lake Combo - both perch and walleye with a delicious cole slaw and a huge pile of fries. It was more than I could eat but I ate more than I should - absolutely delicious. The crisp and perfectly chilled glass of Pinot Grigio was a nice accompaniment to my dinner.

The patrons visiting Monday night all appeared to be locals - a good sign. I can tell why they love it so much. I hope to have a chance to return someday."}
{"text":"Everytime I eat here I'm happy. The fishermans chowder (red) is outstanding. Currently (in the autumn) they have steamed clams. Very good. One reviewer didn't like the \"redneck staff\". Pishaw. A lot of young people working here but they do a good job. Fries a great.  Any place that keeps malt vinegar on the table knows their fries. Nothin fancy. Just some good draft beers great lake perch and walleye in a cozy tavern setting on the Grand River. Worth the drive from metro cleveland."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst places of burnt fish and French fries  I have ever eaten. Taste  like the grease was too, too, too OLD and aged. The coleslaw was dry and tasteless worst than straw. The manager said she would speak with server. However, she never  offered a discount 
 The love of $$$$ and poor quality of food.  I won't return.  I.paid for quality food and received  old smells."}
{"text":"Let me make this review short and simple the best I can... I grew up in lake county in Painesville and went to Brennan's most of my childhood up until over ten years ago when things went down hill but I am happy to say it's back and better then ever get the super clam strips and banana cream pie it's the best or if you don't like fish their steaks are amazing"}
{"text":"Worst service ever..  Showed up got sat.. waited five minutes then finally she asks if we want water not drinks or app.  Then we order drinks too beer and wine. She is behind bar talking to customer at bar.  10 minutes later comes drinks. I ask about specials. She says no and don't look at board behind you it does not mean nothing.  OK.  was that a joke or serious. She then asks table behind us if she can lean over them to wipe the board off.  If I was that table I would be pissed. We had seen enough did not even eat or finish our drinks. Monday 7/6/2015"}
{"text":"Expensive and greasy lunch with lackluster service.  $11 for a grilled chicken sandwich.  It was decent but did not include fries or even chips.  I ordered potato soup and received clam chowder instead.  My total lunch cost $20 before tip.  There are healthier, cheaper and more filling lunch options all over.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"\"YESI Our French Fries are Greasy! They are made from fresh Idaho Potatoes and deep fried when they are ordered. This has been done this way since 1927. Ninety percent of our customers like them. If you do not care for them or your diet does not allow them, we do have other selections you may order in their place.\"

That is a quote straight out of Brennan's menu and, YES, their fries are greasy! VERY greasy (greasiest I have ever had!). Greasy to the point that they drip more than the 4.3 liter on my 1979 Cutlass! It could be that potatoes are fried at too low of a temperature to avoid otherwise. The problem with that is that it seems the crab cakes have been cooked in the same oil and they are also VERY greasy! The crab cakes are flavorful but really don't have much in the way of discernible crab. The crab they do contain appears to have been mechanically separated and really had no texture. The overall feel of the crab cake was just a soggy puck of flavored dough. Not a pleasant experience. 

The fried shrimp was the quality of a fast food restaurant and looked as if it was fresh from the frozen section at Walmart. However, having likely been breaded and frozen by a reputable food manufacturer, the shrimp had flavor in the batter. Something I cannot in good conscience write about the batter which covered the white fish or the yellow perch. 

The white fish was tender and flakey and the yellow perch was cooked well, but both suffered from a dreadful lack of flavor. The fried scallops were my favorite of the bunch as they were tender and not overcooked. 

The clam chowder was pleasant. The potatoes still held some firmness and the clams were generous. Good flavor overall. 

I was a bit disappointed with the overall quality of the food. Although the fish is hand breaded, it lacked flavor, and there are what appear to be some frozen items on the menu. Add to that some possible poor cooking basics that are being disregarded (or are simply not known) and the whole experience was not what I had anticipated. Too bad. I really did like the service and the ambiance is definitely like that of some of the dockside dives I have visited around the US seaboards.

The only upside? I won't need an oil change for another 3,000 miles! facebook.com/foodiepebbles."}
{"text":"This may be almost it for most of the reviewers but for me Brennan's is it. I worked in Painesville for many years. This is where I came with just one coworker for confidential chats. This is where we brought new people or people who were leaving. If friends accompanied me for a work function they ended up here. 

Some may prefer Pickle Bill's across the street. It does have a location on the water, outdoor dining and a great floating bar. Few of us ever went there more than once.  If you are 10-35 I suspect you will prefer Pickle Bill's. 

The testimony for Brennan's is that over the years all of us who go there continue eating the same things. For me the perch sandwich, those soft greasy fries, and a draft non designer beer with no orange slice, lime slice, or any other bubble tea flavors. The only other dish for me is the fried walleye platter. The fries are unique to Brennan's and they warn you on the menu they are the way their customers like them. I can expand that and say all of Brennan's is the way their customers like it. 

I no longer work in that area and I am happy never to have to see my old workplace again, but Brennan's I still frequent."}
{"text":"Drove to Mentor-on-the-Lake today and spent some time on the beach looking for sea glass. And what do you want when you e been by the water all day? Seafood! I had Sex-on-the-beach so I got crabs. The 1 1/2-pound bowl of crab legs, that is. So awesome! I highly recommend this place! BYOB (bring your own bib)."}
{"text":"Great selection of fish & seafood with good food, adjustable portions & fast service in clean & comfortable real-world nautical themed surroundings. We had fried walleye, sautéed scallops, fries, rings, mashed potatoes & fresh homemade applesauce -- all very tasty. Definitely one of the waterfront (Grand River) places where locals gather (even on a Sunday night)."}
{"text":"Great portions and superb quality!  I had the Fisherman's Platter, with yellow perch, whitefish, scallops, shrimp, cole slaw, and fries.  My wife had the delmonico steak with crab legs.  Usually when you eat out you find one or two of the items not up to par - not true here!  Everything was perfectly prepared. My wife said the crab legs were far superior to Red Lobster and the steak was one of the best she had ever had (60 yr. old lady mind you). So wish we lived closer or they were down here.  Huge recommendation to eat here!"}
{"text":"Broken crab leg special. Yes, it is such a thing. I love that they utilize them in this manner, instead of doing the standard of making crab cakes with them. 

Steak and crab legs were good. Steak arrived at the actual requested temp of blue to rare. What would have made the steak much better would have been to serve it with a butter sauce. Instead it was completely unseasoned. Not their fault as I didn't think to ask for any seasoning with it. Crab legs were perfect. 

Yes the place is very outdated and could use an overall cleaning, but for me, that is part of the charm I suppose. I mean, I have been coming here for 30 years or so..."}
{"text":"My family and I have traveled over an hour to get here for YEARS. They have the best perch I've ever had, and I'm so glad to know that delicious seafood is possible in Ohio. The service has always been friendly and the decor is homey and makes you feel like you're on a boat in the lake."}
{"text":"Took Yelp's recommendation to eat here instead of Pickle Bill's (which was surprisingly busy) after enjoying a garbage-filled trip to Mentor Headlands Beach.

Had a party of 9, but got seated right away.  Waitress asked for our drink order as soon as we were settled.  Drinks, apps and meals all came to our table promptly.  Overall, service was good.

Food was surprisingly good as well.  I had the Fisherman's Platter (typical fried sampler), which wasn't bad.  Scallops are almost always a bust (frozen), but the rest of the items (shrimp, crab cake, whitefish and perch) were pretty good.  Fries are greasy, but good.  Cole slaw was also enjoyable.

My wife and daughter shared the 2 lb. crab legs dinner.  My wife - who is a seafood snob, mind you - couldn't stop gushing about the quantity AND quality of the crab legs.  I have a feeling she'll ask to return before the end of the summer.

The mashed potatoes and gravy are money.  While the fries are good, I think I'll go with the mashers next time.

Haven't been to Pickle Bill's, but based on recent reviews, you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't hit Brennan's instead."}
{"text":"This place  does a great job with what it is. If I had a choice, would have given it 3 1/2 stars.

My family was visiting my bro for Easter and we were going to Pickle Bill's, but it wasn't open until 3, so we came over here rather than drive somewhere else. I'm glad we did.

A bit on the small side, the joint look's like a waterside fish shack on the inside. It was almost empty as they had just opened, and our server was a seasoned pro who took care of us well.

The food to get here is definitely the fresh perch, walleye, and clams, etc. They nail it, not too greasy and good and crispy (I highly suggest you get the combo platter of walleye and perch, or just the walleye, as it is gold standard freshwater fish). The beer selection was not huge, but it had GL Dortmunder Gold and a seasonal along with a couple other crafts (not to mention all the macros), so I definitely found it sufficient for a seafood lunch.

If you find yourself in the area and are looking for a solid fish shack, check this place out."}
{"text":"I got the dinner so I could get the Perch and Walleye. I liked the Walleye better. It comes with coleslaw and French fries. I got a salad instead of fries. I got the celery seed dressing that should be called horseradish celery seed. I liked it a lot. The dressing wasn't hot and it wasn't oily must be lo-cal, I have to ask. My sister got the mussels and she said they were over cooked but very good."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the customer service.  They don't take reservations.  We stopped in at 5:30 (early for a weekend dining crowd) on Saturday night, and there was only one group of 5 people before us.  After putting our name on the list, we waited for over 45 minutes!  They seated many groups of 2 at tables for 4 during this time.  I finally asked what the wait time was, and was told THERE WAS NO WAIT TIME because they had just seated their larger tables (so we would have to wait until they were done).  Ran across the street to Pickle Bill's and their wait time was a BIG FAT ZERO.  Pickle Bill's seated us immediately.  We ordered pretty much the same food (but a much larger selection), and we finished eating and left (after a leisurely meal) before we even would have sat down at Brennan's.

To qualify, I grew up in the area of both restaurants, and I am familiar with both.  I am extremely disappointed that Brennan's didn't plan better for the weekend crowd, or at least try to move tables together.  It was just WAIT, with no approximate time.  

Btw, the party of 5 that was waiting before us were still there when we left.  Feel bad for them since they had 2 small children.

Don't go there if you have a party larger than 3 people unless you want to wait indefinitely, and when you ask, you get a blank look from the hostess.  Either that, or they should MAN UP, come into the 21st century, and take RESERVATIONS."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is, but there is a weird vibe up here by Mentor Headlands. Service is pretty lousy in the local restaurants, but this one was okay. It definitely was slow and it's always a bad sign when your server takes 10 minutes to get back around to fill up your drink. To be fair, I don't think I can eat this kind of food anymore, I've discovered. Fried perch just makes me feel bad and does not have the flavor of a good steak, in my opinion. To me, it's just all breading, like a bad appetizer. This place was a little better than Pickle Bill's, but that's not saying much. Overpriced, in my opinion. Clam chowder and crab legs were okay. Slaw and fries were satisfactory."}
{"text":"Visited many fish houses across North America and I have to say this is in the top 3. Amazing food, great old fisherman's wharf ambiance, and excellent service. 
So many tasty things on the menu! Fishermans catch for the fried food lover in us all, perch, whitefish, shrimp, scallops, heck yeah!
Saw many tasty looking dishes being served as well. Walleye, the piece was size of half a football. Crab legs everywhere! Pot roast sandwich could feed an army. 

Seriously worthy of a visit anytime. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"I went here this past Monday(3/30) for my birthday dinner. It was AMAZING!!!! the crab cakes were very well seasoned. The whitefish was perfectly cooked. The catfish was well seasoned as was all the food. The coleslaw was even good which is something that rarely happens in a restaurant. Usually we go across the street to Pickle Bills but they are closed on Mondays. I might not go back there! I can't believe I waited so long to go to Brennan's but we will be making a trip back soon. The staff was also very pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"We are trying the perch and walleye combo . Is very fresh and delicious. The clam chowder excellent. The crab cake delicious. Atmosphere casual and prices are comparable."}
{"text":"River perch yum! This place is great, quick service, good prices. It was a little loud but the perch made up for that. :-)"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere, portions are great, and the prices are reasonable. it's a nice change of pace from the local chains."}
{"text":"My husband says best clam chowder and clam strips. I'm not a sea food lover, but I love the white fish , chili and chicken."}
{"text":"They may lack the waterfront and outdoor seating of their neighboring rival, but the food more than makes up for it. My husband and I had a variety of fried Lake Erie treats here, and it was all great. Tons of food for the price, too. Good service and a cozy atmosphere, too. It all added up to a meal I still remember weeks later. Simple and good."}
{"text":"Popped in one afternoon after a visit to nearby Headlands State Beach. Great nautical decor and views.   Good menu w/ a variety of seafood items, good beer selection.   Had the walleye sandwich and a beer--tasty, quick service, clean restrooms.  Recommended."}
{"text":"I'm Methodist and don't observe Lent but no one can resist Brennan's on the first Friday after Ash Wednesday or any day for that matter.  The Lake Combo is as good as it gets; reminds me of the fried Gulf Combo at Acme Oyster House in NOLA.  Go to this place."}
{"text":"This is a duplicate.  The address is even wrong.  I reported to the moderator.  Please review the Brennan's on River Street and not East Street.  Thanks - Yelp Elite Jeff T."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC SERVICE. Family oriented, great Lake Erie plate w Walleye and Perch. Fries were greasy but good. Crab legs were pretty good although probably were frozen. No crabs that big in Lake Erie. Great selection of IPAs and full bar. I would recommend it any time!!"}
{"text":"The service is remarkable. The food is fabulous. They are known for local Perch and walleye. I like the perch the best and the cole slaw was excellent. You can order soft drinks by the can or fountain. We are so glad we selected this over Pickle Bills because of the yelp reviews."}
{"text":"Found this place when staying in Mentor OH for A-10 conference swimming & diving championships.  FANTASTIC food.  Nice interior decorated with nautical stuff.  Had the perch sandwich with the fries.  Sandwich was GREAT! 3-4 pieces of crispy, sweet perch on a soft bun.  Very tasty.  The fries were done in house - crisp and hot, thin cut (like Steak and Shake only 100 times better!!!)  Had their homemade key lime pie - also excellent.  Will definitely return here in the future!"}
{"text":"I love Brennans! I went here for dinner with my sister on a Saturday, the food is worth every penny. The portions are nice and it is a nice cozy atmosphere. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I just ate here. The place was not busy and they sat us right away. Unfortunately, nobody told the waitress that we were sitting there. It took forever to get waited on. I ordered the Walleye, because that is what they \"are famous for.\" I was shocked and disappointed when my meal arrived, though I said nothing. My \"famous\" walleye was breaded & deep fried. Not one word of this was mentioned in the description of the meal. Other meal descriptions state \"lightly breaded.\" Silly me, I guess if there are things that are lightly breaded, then that means everything else on the menu is breaded and deep fried. There was no flavor, I guess that is why I was given tartar sauce. I've had good walleye and never needed to add tartar sauce to give it flavor. My wife and I will never eat at this place again. I forgot to mention, I had to get my own silverware."}
