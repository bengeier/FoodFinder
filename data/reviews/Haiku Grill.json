{"text":"This place is very cute. I love the various reading material offered at the counter dining spots. I've only tried their sushi so far and it's pretty good. An order of rolls includes 8 rolls and a side of edamame(sp?). The rolls aren't the tightests and most of the time the rice falls off, but the spicy tuna and the california rolls had good flavor. The prices aren't that great, I think they're about $1 to $3 over priced for what they offer on the plate.  But maybe that's why they have their sushi club cards. Something like after you buy 10 sushi meals you get the next one free or something like that."}
{"text":"This place USED to be great...but has gone downhill.  Ordered a Cali roll with miso soup.  Roll was six small pieces (they used to make them much bigger), avocado was brown throughout the roll, 5 pieces of edamame on the side, wasabi was also brown-ish and container for miso was filled 3/4 of the way.  Went last week around 2pm and just ordered side of steamed veggies and rice with miso.  Took them 15 minutes to get my order together, even though it was a simple order and there was only one other guest in the restaurant at the time.  I was subjected to listening to the owners argue with each other the entire time I waited.  They guy at the counter was on his phone the whole time.  So done with this place."}
{"text":"Tempura Shrimp bowl is awesome. I like the fried rice too. It's a bit pricey here."}
{"text":"2-3 stars.

I'm reluctant to give it a solid 2 stars because I have yet to try the sushi. I definitely know that sushi is fresher in AZ than it is in the midwest (where i stayed for 4.5 years), so my assumption is that it can't be too bad. Next time I'll try it. 

The miso soup here is so-so. It's served hot, which is the most important part. The ginger dressing for salads is not too bad, either. The chicken teriyaki bento box, however, was 'eh'. The chicken had a nice flavor to it and you get tons of rice BUT *sigh* the rice was so mushy and wet I felt like it was made for a baby. For the price you pay there's not much variety: soppy rice + chicken + scraps of rubbery cabbage and broccoli + sugary, viscous dressing that is teriyaki sauce. On top of that, the chicken and rice was luke warm... the worst!

But, after all that, I do come back here when I forget to bring my lunch and am craving something close to childhood comfort food."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Haiku Grill for the first time today to grab a California Roll and run back to work.  I will say it was very good!!  8 pieces and only $5 plus tax.  It came with wasabi and ginger as they do most anywhere but it also came with edamame which I did not eat because I am a picky patty.  They had what looked like a decent selection of sushi rolls on the menu plus they have teriyaki bowls and tempura items to choose from.  I will definitely be back to try Haiku Grill again."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch.  I usually get the teriyaki chicken bowl, sauce on the side.  I'm disappointed that they took the short ribs off the menu - they were amazing.  They are quick and efficient.  If I need to pick it up, I usually call and it is ready in 5-10 minutes."}
{"text":"I've been to Haiku Grill many times and can definitely recommend it as a good place to eat.  I normally order a \"Chicken Veggie Bowl\" with all-white meat and brown rice. Their brown rice usually comes out really good (not an easy task for most places) and the chicken and veggies are tasty.

Today, I decided to try their maki and ordered the spicy tuna rolls. Spicy tuna rolls is my favorite sushi, but I've had bad sushi in the past and I'm always a little wary to try it at new places. However, I had noticed lots of other people eating sushi here during my previous visits and from what I could tell they enjoyed their meals.  I was happily surprised with the quality of the sushi at Haiku Grill. The rolls were a good size (other places I've gone to make them too large to easily fit in your mouth) and had a good amount of fish in them.  My one complaint would probably be that the roll wasn't very spicy. The edamame was very good as well.

On another plus, the staff is very friendly and I've never had a case of bad service.  

If you're in a hurry, go for the chicken bowl as I had to wait about twice as long for my rolls and I saw orders for chicken and beef bowls that were placed after my order come out before mine. Not a complaint, but something to keep in mind.  You can always call in your order, too.

Haiku Grill - made of win!"}
{"text":"Great food, and I got it quickly. The cashier was very friendly and helpful will be back forsure."}
{"text":"How do you do a all white chicken teriyaki wrong? Go here! Very dry & bland. Already left with it to go... A few bites and it went in the trash."}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever , avoid this place.  20 year old on a power trip with no customer service skills running the restaurant insulting customers and talking about how white people are idiots. I asked for a lime and he said nothing in life is free if you don't like it you don't have to come back.
Its sad how an ignorant kid can destroy his moms restaurant . Its upsetting how in 2016 are still racist people out there."}
{"text":"Very rude and they don't have any fish.  My 5 year old just wanted a tuna roll.  They only have salmon and could not make a salmon roll.  Again very rude when I requested a basic roll.  I won't eat at a sushi restaurant that barely has the fish and can make basic rolls. I couldn't eat there after me and my daughter were treated with rudeness. I live close by and will not waste my time with that type of business."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food!  The prices are just right and they have a punch card for a free drink and free lunch.  I love the Chicken Yakisoba Noodles... a favorite!"}
{"text":"I was a little upset when I received my \"Winter Special Spicy Ramen\" and the noodles very clearly came from a pack of Maruchan top ramen. The soup wasn't bad, it was nice and spicy- but still not worth $7.99! 
Service was pleasant :)"}
{"text":"Spicy ramen with seafood is excellent made fresh I love when seafood is made fresh in Phoenix because we not close to oceans"}
{"text":"Wasn't widely impressed with the food the first time i stopped in a few weeks ago.  Decided to give it another go today for lunch, and man... aint going back for sure. I had the unagi bowl and it was just overly drenched with an oddly sweet teriyaki sauce. Being Asian, i knew this wasn't going to be \"authentic\" asian cuisine, but i'm pretty flexible considering my locaiton.  But the young cashier girl is mainly what turned me off to the place.  She dilly dallied as she attempted to flirt with a gay guy that was in front of me who didn't even order anything.  When she finally took my order, she forgot to give me my drink cup.  Since there was a lady behind me waiting to order as well, i decided to wait till after she ordered to ask for my drink cup.  Mind you there was only the two of us as customers at the time.  When i asked her for the cup, she said, with attitude, \"oh yea..\" and came back with a plastic water cup! When i asked her if it was the 'large drink cup' she glared at me, and said \"is that what you ordered\".. ok  seriously, she wrung up a total of 3 items in the last 10 minutes, and she already forgot what 1 of the 3 items was?  When i said yes and showed her my receipt, she snatched the cup outta my hand, fiddled behind the counter for a few, and handed me the correct cup size, but not forgetting to roll her eyes as she handed it to me.  What ever happened to customer service?"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just not a food snob. For the price of a sandwich at other places, you get a typical-sized bowl of rice, chicken, and veggies, all cooked just-right. Sure, the teriyaki sauce is a little on the salty (or maybe MSG) side, but most are.
Not sure where people get off giving a 1- or 2-star review. Maybe they should be lunching in Scottsdale instead..."}
{"text":"Overall my first experience here was good. I got the Vegas roll which I was happy with and miso soup but soup has no tofu which is typically the part I love about miso soup so that was a bummer. But even after reading most bad reviews on this place I'll be back for more sushi on my lunch break again."}
{"text":"Very simple, enjoyable food for lunch. The teriyaki chicken bowl and beef bowl are tasty. They have a large menu. Bathroom, free refills, never a madhouse. High ceilings. Food gets cooked very quickly. Comfy alternative rock and pop to set the atmosphere. Not overdone, simple, straightforward."}
{"text":"The food is horrible. We had the teriyaki chicken bowl and 3 sushi roles. All were garbage. And over priced."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now so I think I can safely review. 
Their teriyaki sauce is pretty generic, not really amazing or bad. 
Their eel with rice wasn't too bad. 
Their chicken with veggies and rice was probably my favorite. They will sometimes use a mix of dark and white meat but it's generally cooked pretty well. 
I don't recommend the beef. Especially on this order, I had a lot of tough tendon in mine that's inedible. 
Also, when I order vegetables without rice it's usually given like a soup which can be disappointing. It's likely because they add freshly steamed vegetables without letting the water run off, so soup."}
{"text":"Haiku Grill is near my work place and I was looking for something other than pizza or sandwiches. Unfortunately the stir fry sauce really didn't taste good to me. It's very one-note sweet, and no amount of soy sauce and siracha was saving it. I ordered a Veggie Bowl, which was on the small side. It wasn't large enough to make a full meal of."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place an average review.  There rolls are good as well as their service.  My disappointment was their teriyaki bowls.  Not to impressed with those.  Doesnt have a good teriyaki flavor.  Their roles are decent though for being fast food."}
{"text":"I want to like this place more because their menu looks very appetizing.  I got the beef yaki soba noodles... when i think of soba noodles they are a little thicker than ramen noodles.  These were not it, they were more like ramen noodles.  The beef was very good not fatty at all and the veggies were good too.  The sauce had a little too much ginger in it or something... just didn't appeal to my tastes much.  I came here with 7 other people and almost everyone enjoyed their meal so this tells me I need to try something else.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Let's start out with the taste. MEH, it's ok. I ordered the beef and vegetable bowl. Its mostly,  actually a lot, of rice. A very small layer of thinly sliced beef and portion of vegetables. They are stratigacly placed on top of the rice to seem like a full bowl when actually it's all rice for $8.00. You are better off going to Samurai Sam's down the road or going to Filiberto's or the Greek restaurant in the same complex."}
{"text":"Great simple sushi place!

Not a whole lot of frills, not a wide \"authentic\" selection, but perfect if you want a quick, simple meal.  

No Sushi bar- it's more like a good fast food Sushi restaurant.  Serves other food as well- but have never tried anything else.  

Place closes at 7- I have always went there for (take out) diner right before they close, and there is always someone trying to get in after hours."}
{"text":"The teriyaki chicken platter is a great deal with Miso Salad. This family owned and run restaurant is a welcome option for those seeking healthy cuisine at a great price. Sushi rolls are available and don't forget to get your valued customer card and earn a free lunch."}
{"text":"I gave this place a 5 stars simply because of the staff. I read a few reviews about \"rude service\" and I have NO idea where these people are coming from. If you treat the people serving you with the same respect you think you deserve, you will be pleasantly surprised. Anyway, I digress, but after my second or so time eating there (I work nearby) the staff recognized me and said it was nice to see me again. It seems the owner is in the kitchen, ringing orders up, and cleaning up after guests. The food is maybe 3 star quality but given the other options for asian cuisine in the area this comparatively I rate it 5 stars. I always get the fried rice, it is SO tasty and the veggies are all really good. The teriyaki beef leaves a bit to be desired, but it definitely satisfies my cravings. 

The absolute most amazing thing on their menu is the Gyoza. I go there sometimes and order 2 orders for lunch and that is it. I LOVE IT.

The ramen is SUPER spicy, and it is a LOT of food. It makes me sad they don't have to go containers to take it with you, and its a little messy."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars I would. I paid $9 for Beef Fried Rice and it barely had beef let alone anything else. It was more like beef tips. I work across the street from this placed and just b/c it is convenient is THE ONLY reason I stopped. NEVER again. What a shame to charge this price for so little and no flavor. We have a large organization that caters lunches twice per week and I will never ever use this restaurant for our office functions. On a brighter side, the people were kind and quick service but it still does not make up for the poor quality. Stay Away!"}
{"text":"Eat there at your own risk!!!!! I got severe nearly fatal food  poisoning after eating sushi there !!!! I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Nothing stands out. Every time I've gone (maybe 4 times cause it's so close to my work) I've though that I should have gone somewhere else. The food has come out runny, and the $8 ramen is just a prepackaged ramen with a little bit of veggies mixed in."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The chicken fried rice is the shiznittlebamsnipsnacksack! Everyone is so nice there, and the guys are super cute! Yes, I went there! :)"}
{"text":"I work across the street from Haiku Grill and go there once in a while for lunch. I have always had a good experience - the food is good, reasonably priced, very friendly staff, and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"Nothing out of this world. Very ordinary. Ordered the terriyaki chicken bowl and it had way too much terriyaki sauce. Not to mention it was way too sweet."}
{"text":"I have dined here a few times.  I come in to town for work across the street.  The service has always been great and fast.  The food is always fresh and tasty.  I'm not sure about the bad reviews, that has not been my experience.  I will be back tomorrow so looking forward to eating there again!"}
{"text":"Was rather amped up today to try this place for lunch today, as I noticed they had sushi and Asian-style noodles.

It is a smaller restaurant, as it sits in a plaza competing with Starbucks, Roma Cafe, and Filiberto's, but offered inside seating as well as patio seats (weather permitting).

I ordered the Chicken Yakisoba noodles and a Spicy Tuna Roll. The roll was decent, but this is coming from a growing \"sushi snob\" that is hard-to-please at times. Not bad, but nothing amazing. The noodles were okay, but there was one spice that just didn't seem \"right\" in the sauce. Almost like a nutmeg? Cinnamon? I don't know, but it didn't jive for me. I still ate it because it was edible and I was starving, but if I do return, I'll try something else."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi and non-sushi lovers. I went there my second time today for lunch, and it is really easy to get to by car, walking, or light rail!

The restaurant is clean and simple, with plenty of table even during lunchtime. I had the Tiger Roll (shrimp, avocado and cucumber) and a side of white rice, which was perfect for my hunger level.  My boyfriend's Beef Teriyaki Bowl was very simple (rice and beef with sauce), but was very tasty!

Haiku Grill has a pretty extensive sushi and non-sushi menu, and is a good alternative to Mill Ave. for lunch!"}
{"text":"It was okay. Maybe it was the lunch time crunch but the teriyaki steak was a bit thin and seemed to be more rice than anything. It was okay. But have had better, there is a Lack of options in the area so. I'll come back probably... Give them another chance"}
{"text":"I ordered the ramen special, and it was straight-up top ramen or some other packaged ramen, complete with rehydrated vegetables. They didn't even bother sprucing it up with some pork, egg, or fish cakes. Just a 35 cent package of ramen for $7.50. The owners of this place should be ashamed of themselves. Don't eat here!!!"}
{"text":"I visited this place again and noticed that the food quality was not the same. I ordered the chicken and beef teriyaki plate as usual and everything was covered in sauce making it look like it had a lot of meat. If that is what this place is all about now it is definitely not worth the near  $10 I paid. Of course I would try this place again as it was really good in the past,  hopefully I don't get the same experience."}
{"text":"I love this place - right across the street from my office. I usually go for the chicken bowl. You can get it with brown rice, white meat only if you wish. I have had the beef & chicken bowl, the California rolls, the Las Vegas rolls and the Philly Roll. The staff is very friendly and the food is quick - even though the place is usually packed at lunch. If I go out at lunch, 9 times out of 10 it is here."}
{"text":"Great little place for lunch. I recently visited Japan and tried a LOT of ramen so naturally I wanted to see how their Spicy Ramen lunch special was. Noodles were not over cooed and provided some nice bounce but not the best I have found in the area. Broth was thick and rich as I would hope for. The atmosphere left something to desire but I enjoyed that the owner seemed to be in the kitchen, front counter and picked up after guests which is something I always enjoy seeing."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here. Its right down the way from my office and all of the people working are typically friendly and talkative! I haven't tried too many things because I'm a creature of habit but their sushi rolls, teriyaki bowls, and yakisoba have all been great. Sometimes can be a little bit salty but it's somewhat expected. Overall one of my favorite work lunch spots."}
{"text":"I never leave bad reviews but I have to say that you do not want to come here!
After a nice young man took my order and provided suggestions I got the beef fried rice with a side of teriyaki sauce. It arrived quickly after and I went back to eat it in my office.
Upon taking the first bite it smelled foul. I could not tell if it was the egg or the beef. I am not a picky person so I tried another bite and got a mouth full of gristly meat. I attempted one last bite after adding the sauce and it tasted as though the sauce was made from a brown gravy packet with sugar added! It was disgusting!
I went back and politely let the man know that I could not eat it and requested a refund he said he was not a manager and went to get a woman named Sharon.

 I politely told her in a discreet way so others could not overhear that I could not eat it because of the smell of the eggs and the meat and asked for a refund.

She immidiatley started trying to show me receipts saying her eggs are fresh trying to convince me her food is good and said they don't give refunds. She offered me a credit for next time but I let her know I was hungry and just wanted to go elsewhere and wanted my money back. 

She started yelling at me in front of 4 other customers which brought me to tears saying she had been there 10 years and her food is good. I started walking away to leave she FOLLOWED ME to the door while yelling. I asked her to please stop yelling at me and she said \"well you made me mad\".
She took my refund request personal or an insult which it was not and her response instead of resolving it was to attack me. 
My co workers and I will not be back because of her."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find sushi near work...until I went there.  Got a Philly roll - the salmon was warm, slimy, and soft.  I don't know if it was just cheap salmon or not being properly stored but I wasn't even sure if it was safe to eat.  Obviously had not been being chilled recent to use.  Flavor was bland.  For a $16 lunch I was not impressed."}
{"text":"It's never a good sign when the best part about your meal is the edamame.  Stopped in to grab to go for lunch and ordered the Las Vegas Roll which comes with Edamame, and a side of Miso Soup.  The Miso soup is listed as $1.50 on their website but has had a price change to $1.95.

The Miso soup tasted like water and had no tofu.  It was so bland I ate two bites and threw the rest away.  The Las Vegas roll was ok size for $8.99 but was awkward to eat.  They made the roll, wrapped it again in rice and seaweed, and then battered it.  The 2nd rice/seaweed layer made the roll fall apart when I tried to eat it.  The roll was also poorly cut.  Some pieces were ¼\" wide while others were close to 1\" thick.  The side of Edamame was very good, though.  Usually when it is a side that comes with the entrée it is bare bones but this edamame was firm and flavorful

I came around 12:30 PM on a Thursday and there were only 3 tables.  There is a table of self-serve condiments with to go cups for the soy sauce, but most of the bottle were empty.  There is also a condiment holder with ginger, wasabi, and lemons, but the ice to keep all three items cool had melted down so far that nothing was touching ice.  The wasabi was old and had very little flavor.  

Beware of the parking lot.  The lot is good sized but with the Starbucks drive through, it is very easy to get blocked in by the long line for coffee."}
{"text":"Majority of the negative reviews I see are by uncultured Americans who don't even understand true Asian cuisine, or people who are expecting too much in a fast casual restaurant. As for the people complainimg about the price, blame the people who voted for the increase of minimum wage. If you want something simple, fast, and delicious this is the place to go. Since I work nearby, this is my go-to spot considering I prefer any type of Asian food over others. They're also family owned which is a plus. 

I recommend the Hot Crunchy Roll, Avocado Salad, and Chicken Yakisoba. Those are just a few of my favorites. Their cashiers can put a little more effort in being friendly but overall I can't complain since they get the job done."}
{"text":"Got the chicken teriyaki bowl and it was about as good as a microwave dinner. Maybe if I had upgraded to white meat it would have been better, but I didn't notice that option until it was too late."}
