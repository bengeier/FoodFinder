{"text":"Ridiculously slow and bad and inefficient service... Even though they're nice enough people doing it... So I blame management for not having enough staff"}
{"text":"The Mill Street Brewery disappointed me and my friends. Coming with little kids to a place wasn't a good idea in the beginning, but I was shocked by the level of service we were provided. One of the waitress refused to take our order at the patio and then transfer our food into the dining area. Then management got involved and finally after 20 min of wait the food was ordered. Then it turned out they forgot to send our food to the kitchen, IT TOOK 1 HOUR TO GET FOOD which was absolutely tasteless. The waitstaff and management showed their indifference to clients. They have their business because of tourists and travellers who come there because of beer, so it seems like they do not care to lose one or two. Although beer was good there, we will unlikely to come back!"}
{"text":"Overall, my experience at Mill St wasn't too bad. Yeah, the wait for a table was a little bit lengthy, and my waitress did seem to forget my order of sweet potato fries (which were delicious once they got to me. Crispy on the outside, and creamy on the inside. Just as they should be!), but I really can't blame them. With the Christmas Market on, Mill St is jam packed with people looking to grab a bite and get out of the cold. So really, I can't hold a couple of little flubs to them.   The best part would definitely have to be the beer flights. There is the four-beer 6oz flight for 8$ and change, and the four-beer 8oz flight for 11$ and change. You get to pick any of their draught beers, as well as from their selection of holiday brews.  I highly recommend the vanilla porter. Lovely head, dark body, smooth on the palette with a hefty kick of vanilla, and not an ounce of aftertaste to be found. The perfect draught for a cold winter afternoon/evening."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch at the pub last weekend.  The patio was very nice and there was a great live jazz band that played during our meal. We ordered the chicken schnitzel and a chopped salad with smoked salmon (the salad came in layers that you mixed yourself ).   The service was top notch, the ambiance was nice but the food wasn't great.  The salad was quite small for $16 and the salmon verged on being fishy.   The fries that came with the chicken however were quite good.   I think it's nice to come here for drinks, but I wouldn't want to eat here again."}
{"text":"They have awesome beers and that is the best thing about this place. It is also a more relaxed option for eating in the area. The price-quality balance with the food is not the best. But it is mainly a busy pub. With the beers you can't go wrong. Have been here a couple of times and usually find my way back every now and then."}
{"text":"drives on the distillery district location therefore over priced food. staff not skilled to handle complications and i say that with experience. i could categorize the servers as arrogant to a certain extent.Duck wings were good but the unfriendly staff kills it.Somehow feel really bad by the way we were treated here and a group of 20 that too. In all toronto is filled with pubs that welcome you with a smile,staying away from an over priced mill street pub might just save you from spending em extra bills on crappy service and decent but over proced food."}
{"text":"We go here all the time, as it's close to our house.  A great place to sit on the patio and have a pint.  Try the pumpkin ale while it's around. Also, the 8 oz beer flight is a great deal; 32 oz for 10.50 the food is good, not amazing, but good pub fare the staff are friendly, and the general atmosphere is fairly typical.   also, the attached beer store is open on holidays A fantastic place to go if your in the area"}
{"text":"I just moved to the GTA from San Diego, where the beer is some of the best in the world.  Toronto just doesn't stack up.  BUT... in my short Toronto travels, this is the best micro brew/pub in the town.  The beer is good and the food doesn't disappoint.  If there is a better place to grab a fresh micro brew, let me know, but for me Mill Street is the best in the town."}
{"text":"The food is not that great, I have had better, but they have great beers. The service was great and the food came out really fast. I love the décor of the place and I like how the tables aren't very close to each other."}
{"text":"Looked so forward to stopping here for a flight of beers and baked pretzels.   Service - seated and served by lackluster people who looked like they didn't like their jobs. Not sure what the problem was but this was the most lacking service we had in our entire Toronto trip.  Atmosphere - big-chain brew pub.  Food - the pretzels were really mediocre. The aioli and marinara dips were yuck. Where is the mustard? The cheese dip? Perhaps other food is better although the reviews don't seem to support that theory. The brunch foods I saw on other tables looked good though.  Beer - first, very disappointed that the three set flights can not be modified. So for example each of the flights includes a fruit beer (which the server said was raspberry and turned out to be lemon) and either a porter or stout. We didn't want to taste any of these but wanted to taste other combinations. Anyway, frustrating. Then the beers were really almost mediocre. The IPA was best. Overall they were on the warm side - less than refrigerator temperature.  Tasting Room / Retail Store - we should have gone left as we entered instead of right into the restaurant. The only reason this review gets 3 stars in the friendly worker in the tasting room who offered generous samples of the brewery's most common 4 beers that would be found in restaurants. These samples were colder than the restaurant.  I only wish there had been something we wanted to buy from here."}
{"text":"Great beer, great atmosphere but lack of better service. Went with a group of 8 people and found ourselves waiting for about 30-45mins without a drink (after placing the order). Still had a great time once we got our drinks but still hoped the service would a better. Maybe we will have a different experience next time we visit because we will definitely be back. Great spot to \"pre-game\" and even watch the game. Staff are very knowledgeable on the beer and I found the beer I selected to be great."}
{"text":"Flights and wanngggs!   Accommodating staff. Knew their beers very well.. Told them my favorites: Stella. Blue moon. Cherry Wheat and I was given a flight of beers that went terrific with their Asian infused duck wings!  I wish you were closer to home Mill St!!"}
{"text":"Beer was pretty good. Steak was juicy and tasty. I loved how they did the 4 sample beer  so that I can try them all! Super crowded though and they put us(4 people) into one tiny round table...service was okay. Was hard to place the plates and our beers because we were scared of it falling."}
{"text":"Yes, you could get a table here for dinner, but really more fun is to be had sitting on a chair at the bar and watching all the beer happen.  Popped in one afternoon for a quick drink after touring the Distillery District, then somehow found myself doing a tasting menu, having dinner, then doing shots with strangers.  Good times.    The pub fare is quite good with great sized portions.  Was very happy with the wings and nachos we ordered.  For our mains later the fish and chips were great as well as their pasta special.  Lots of variety on the menu so I imagine if you are one of those types of people to do office function type things this would be a good place to have as a venue - enough choice for a variety of dietary needs.    The best part is that there is a beer store attached, so as we made our way out we picked up a couple of jugs (yes actual jugs of beer) to enjoy at home later.    Joy!"}
{"text":"The Mill Street Brewery is a pub in a tourist area. That said, the food here is 'safe' for parents and people from out of  town like fish and chips etc. My personal favourite is the shrimp tacos.   On Mondays, all of their appetizers are 5 bucks! Try the shrimp tacos!!  They also have the MBA (Masters of Beer Appreciation) card which is their incentive programme. You get a stamp for every beer and if you fill the card, you get your name engraved on the keg at the door. You have to ask for a card, they only give it to locals and regulars.   If you find yourself in the Distillery, it is a great place to pop in for a beer and grab a bite!"}
{"text":"Server was great. Food was very slow to arrive - almost 30 minutes!   However, both salads were quite tasty (once they got there)!  The local dark beer was excellent!  All in all - not spectacular - but a very nice place to go nevertheless."}
{"text":"A lovely spot to pass an hour or two in the sunshine, a great selection of beers in a lovely area. Service was very good too. If I lived in Toronto I would be a regular here."}
{"text":"Went here for St. Patrick's day, and I found the service to be very efficient even though it was packed. We were seated right away and the waiters were very attentive. They serve typical pub fare. The food tasted average and was reasonably priced. I was happy to see that there is a TV where they were playing the Leafs game. I wouldn't travel just to go to this venue, but I'd definitely stop by next time I'm in the distillery district."}
{"text":"My family and I were in the Distillery District the other day and despite raining we had a pretty good time. Kind of sucks that everything except the restaurants close at 5pm on the weekends. Because of that we ended up having an early dinner. Since it was my parent's first time at the Distillery, I felt it would be appropriate to eat at the brewery!    Mill St. Extra Special Bitter (ESB): I generally don't prefer darker beers because they are so bitter, but this one wasn't too bad. I'm no professional beer connoisseur, but I thought the beer was alright. Could've been a a little colder.  Brewmaster's Mussels: I really liked this dish despite it's small size. The mussels were steamed with some Belgian beer, chorizo, and some other stuff. The beer flavour wasn't overpowering, but strong enough to know its there. The chorizo gave it a nice flavouring.   Distillery Burger: My sister ordered this burger and she had quite a bit of difficulty finishing it. Not because it didn't taste good, but because it was just too much food! The burger came topped with a BBQ sauce made from Mill St. Coffee Porter beer, swiss cheese and crispy fried onions. Really good burger! Meat was juicy and tender. I really liked that the burger came with and egg bread burger bun, because I think it just tastes so much better than regular buns.The fries reminded me of new york fries, and came fresh and hot. Perfect compliment to the burger.   Traditional Roast Beef Dinner: A lot of us ended up ordering this because it sounded so appetizing from the menu! It comes with some steamed vegetables, mash potatoes, yorkshire pudding, and a side of horseradish. I ordered my roast beef medium rare, and found they gave me more of a medium. Despite being a little more cooked than I would've liked it, it was still a very good roast beef. Make sure you come on Sundays after 5pm if you ever want to try this. That is the only time they serve it each week!  Usually my parents don't care much for eating pub food, but they actually said they didn't mind this meal. I guess you can't go wrong with decent food at very decent prices. I really want to come here again in the day time because you get a free brewery tour with your meal!"}
{"text":"Had the beer, none of the food and I don't regret the decision at all.  We arrived late to the tour (only kegs are made on site in about 5 tanks) but were able to pick up in the middle (it was free and it wasn't crowded at all) and go back to the sampling room.  Instead of staying in the sampling room where choice was limited we went to the restaurant and tried most of the beers, including the seasonals.  The tasting sampler lets you pick 4 beers to try and there are some suggestions available, but you can sample anything available.   The beers are wonderful.  Many are made with organic hops. My favorites were the lemon tea beer and the organic ale.  The prices seemed expensive to us (Americans) but this is the only brewery we toured in Canada.  We still bought extras to take home."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good - a notch above regular pub fare. Very good service.   However we had one major problem. Just as we were ordering, a guy started setting up an amp and guitar next to us. Before we knew it he was playing and singing cover tunes - pretty much drowning out all conversation and actually made the overall experience disappointing. We just finished our meal and left. Not worth the ~$170 we spent between our two parties totalling 5 people. Not to mention, we waited an hour to be seated - not their fault, I know. But it just made the whole thing even more aggravating.  The pub should ditch the live entertainment - it's totally not necessary. Nobody applauded after every song. I felt bad for the guy, but it doesn't work."}
{"text":"Classic pub with a great location and professional service - the only thing holding you back from your frites and adult beveraging is the lineup. Quelle surprise!  We went for the Christmas Market this Saturday, thinking it would be no big deal. Wrongo! It was packed - packed! Strollers, carollers, mulled wine and pretzels and zero parking. Thought we'd never get into my favourite Distillery Pub BUT....  ATMOSPHERE  I'm a repeat offender at Mill Street so this isn't new ground. Classic English pub, at least in my mind, warm wood, open concept, slightly dark but golden. High top tables, bar, a few booths. It's a nice pub, so wearing jeans is fine but it's still in the Distillery, so show a little class - they'd better be fashionable jeans. Good for groups, couples and tourists, natch.  FOOD  Pubby. Bit pricey. Sure, the meatloaf will rock your socks, but it will still be $17 dollar meatloaf. Like I said, very British Isles pubby, with high-quality fries, burgers, steak, etc. We ordered the sweet potato fries, yum. How many does it feed? Answer: two to three. Be prepared to order another.  BEER  It's Mill Street so this gets a special category.  Five seasonal brews on tap and the regular Mill Street fare, which is good beer. Not my favourite, but still good. The lemon beer is something special, but I prefer dark, icky tar-pit beer and Mill Street's Cobblestone Stout is not the top of my list. The vanilla porter has great vanilla notes but isn't bitter enough for me. I ordered both though, and let me say they still went down nice. The shocker of the evening went to the cider - for the non-beer drinker, belly up to this sneaky drink and enjoy. At 5.3% it tastes amazing! I hate cider! I hate fruity alcohol that isn't wine! Hiss! But this was good.   SERVICE  Standout performance by host and server. Party of 7? We came at 5:00 pm, elbowing the entire population of Bradford out of the way to get there and assumed we'd have to wait 3 hours for a table. We were in there at 5:45 pm! Our server was pleasant and professional - can't have asked for better.   LOCATION  Oh Distillery. So pretty. And artsy. If you haven't gone, you must. GTAr, you can catch the GO to Union and the streetcar to the Distillery, but really it will be faster to drive. There are four Green Ps in the area. But! Do not do this for the Christmas Market. You have been warned.   OVERALL  A good bet for a classic yet classy pub experience while enjoying all the Distillery District has to offer. Get in line!"}
{"text":"Yup, the location is great, so that's one star. And they're open on Saturdays, that's a second star.  But regarding beer.... this is typical Ontario swill that's only one step up from coors lite.  My wife asked the bartender if they had a \"brown ale\" and she replied \"what's that?\". Strike one.  I ordered an IPA. I think they forgot to put in the hops. Yes it tasted like an ale, but surely the brewmaster could have found some hops somewhere in north america to add to the wort and finish. Strike two.  Sitting at the bar one would expect a bit of service (not too much, not too little) but to wait 10 minutes with empty glasses (for either a refill or the bill) is too long. Strike three.  Go to the Burger Bar and Tequila Tavern if you want some tap beers that are up to snuff."}
{"text":"Tolle Kneipe im historischen Distillery District. An den Gastraum ist eine kleine Brauerei angeschlossen die auch besichtigt werden kann. Die verschiedenen Biere können selbstverständlich im Restaurant probiert werden. Die Kellner sind aufmerksam und erklären gerne alle Unterschiede der einzelnen Biere. Das Essen ist sehr lecker und die Portionen sind groß. Es gibt an verschiedenen Wochentagen Tagesangebote die sich wirklich lohnen. Der Laden ist leider immer ziemlich voll. Vor Allem am Abend. Reservieren lohnt sich. An der langen Theke findet sich allerdings fast immer ein Platz. Auch aufgrund der Interessanten Lage im historischen Distillery District mit seinen Galerien Handwerksläden und Geschäften, lohnt sich der Besuch auf jeden Fall. 5 Sterne von mir."}
{"text":"Just refuelling while travelling through Canada. I got the UP Express Beer Flight. My two favourite beers on draught were the Mill St. Original Organic Lager - which is malt & hops with refreshing honey flavour &   the Mill St. Seasonal Rye which is similar to a sour. Service was lacking and the beer wench seemed rude, but I enjoyed the beer."}
{"text":"It would have been 5 stars, as the Beer is top notch.  I deducted 2 stars for the food they serve you....cold and tastless.  A word of advice, come for the beer and go eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"SLOW service -- it took an hour for the food to arrive, leaving only 30 minutes for us to eat and pay. Not enough food unless you have the burger & fries. There are no extras - there's no ice or lemon even in the water on a hot day, no breadbasket...  With all of the other restaurants in the area they are just not competitive anymore. OK but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Nice place if you are looking for a comfortable higher scale pub type experience. The food is much better than standard pub fare as well. If you are in the distillery and want an affordable bite this is a good place to get it."}
{"text":"The main attraction here is the beer (Coffee porter is one of my faves, and the Tankhouse Ale is solid too) and, to a lesser extent, the surroundings. It's great sitting outside the Mill St. Brewery amongst the cobblestones as the sun goes down. I would imagine it's not really worth the trip in the winter.  In my experience, the food is fine: slightly fancied-up pub grub, at a slightly ratcheted-up price. But they do have okay specials, so you may not need to stay in the burger comfort zone if you're here for food too."}
{"text":"Mill Street Brewery is a good place to enjoy a beer but the food is over-priced for run of the mill pub food and the service is slow.  Pros:  good patio, good beer list, lively pub atmosphere, if there's a wait, you can wander around the Distillery while you wait for your pager to buzz.  Cons: Prices and service.   i.e. $17 for a chicken wrap with side salad.  House wine is $9 for 6 oz.  If you're going to have prices like this, they better be justified by amazing service.   They are not.  I've eaten here a handful of times and the service is sloooowwww.  My conclusion is that this is not because the kitchen is backed up or the place is understaffed.  I think it's because the serving staff is bad.  It's not uncommon to see three or four servers chatting by the computer systems.  My most recent visit here, I watched our server chat with a guest about his new iPhone for a good 10 minutes while we waited for ketchup.  (it never came.  The table beside us let us use theirs).  Bills are slow. Glasses are left empty for a long time before a second round is offered.  So overall:  Atmosphere: 4/5 Food: 3/5 Service 1/5 Value: 2/5  To any restaurant owners reading this, please consider opening up something to compete with Mill Street!  They will never need to step up their game without competition.  They currently have a monopoly on casual food in the Distillery."}
{"text":"I'm totally into the Mill Street Brewery. It's a local micro brewery and they have these tiny bottles of Corona style beer. They make an amber and a dark too, but it's the organic that everyone knows.  And usually you can get a Mill St. deal at any local bar in Toronto. S the locals get down with the Mill St.  And as with all breweries, you can get mad discounts on beer if you just buy it direct from them."}
{"text":"UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE - HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE  The customer service was great until....  My husband and his friend needed to step out briefly to put more money into the parking meter. On their way out, the waitress Ava questioned where they were going.  My husband responded his intent and informed Ava that his wife (myself) is still at the table.  I suspect that this is not standard protocol for servers to question customers where they are heading to, especially when the rest of the party are still sitting and enjoying their time.  Customers can be heading to the washroom, or even smoke breaks.  Is there a particular reason why the waitress asked such a question? Was she implying that my husband and his friend were trying to leave the restaurant without paying.  When Ava was questioning my husband and his friend, there was another waitress next to Ava.  While I observed the conversation between Ava and my husband, I also questioned \"what is going on?\".  The waitress next to Ava told me it was \"None of my business\" and questioned why I am getting involved.   As a wife, I have the right to know why my husband is getting questioned and hassled. I didn't appreciate the treatment and rude attitude of this other waitress as (1) I was not directing my question of \"What's going on\" to her and (2) why did she speak to a customer with such a rude tone of voice.   I find the actions of both Ava and her colleague extremely inappropriate."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what it is.....I come here a lot since I live in the Distillery District. The food is OK, but not worth the prices. It's always hit or miss. Sometimes my food is good, sometimes it's really terrible. The mussels are usually my go-to choice. Ask for the Minumus beer if you decide to go. It comes in a goblet and gets you feeling pretty buzzed after just one :)"}
{"text":"I was born on Mill St in Cooksville Ont in 1946 and have lived in California  for 60 years...I wanted to visit this pub out of nostalgia. 1st...the food is very good! The beers are wonderful.  BUT...the waitresses never smile & acted as we were bothering them. A manager brought the food & he was a very pleasant chap.  All the staff looked as if someone  had just told them they were getting half their normal salaries."}
{"text":"Beers are the reason to be here. I had the pilsner, smooth and clean. Perhaps the food has improved since the reviews below; I had a perfectly good club sandwich, crisp fries and a nice 'slaw. The room is nice too, with that Distillery vibe and a very good sound system for a restaurant. I was on my way to the theatre, and service was timely.   As it happened, I was seated at the bar next to one of the cooks, who'd just come off shift. He said the vast majority of customers were tourists, as locals wouldn't come \"this far east\". This will change I'm sure as the neighbourhood develops--this place could become an institution."}
{"text":"+ great brews, + delicious food, - some staff has attitudes, - can be packed on weekends  A must-do in Toronto is a walk through Distillery District, a re-vitalized industrial area with numerous cafes, restaurants, shops and bars. Within this area is also Mill Street Brewery with a wide choice of own brews and tasty pub fare.  The brewery has a cool setting and is amongst the lower priced eateries in the district and seems to be quite popular. It gets quite packed on the weekend so allow some waiting time. The crowds might be also the reason why some employees are overworked and greet you less friendly than you are used to.  Anyways, the brewery is worth a visit and for a less noisy surrounding I recommend asking for a table on the outside patio (seasonal).  When it comes to the brews try the award-winning red amber (Tankhouse) and have the lobster avocado club for lunch or dinner (what a treat!).  + great brews,  + delicious food,  + cool setting, - some staff has attitudes and is unfriendly  - can be packed on weekends  Average price for an entrée: CAN $15-20 with daily specials during the week."}
{"text":"Slow service from the start and all the way through our meal.  It's nice inside and in a great area, but a little pricy for what you get; $12 for a kids meal.  The kids meal is a good size.  Beers were tasty, but also expensive."}
{"text":"Had dinner here before going to another event on a Saturday evening. Made a reservation which saved us waiting in a long line at the door. We each ordered a flight and had a bit of each of the summer brews (except Ginger Cat) - they were refreshing and light tasting.   We had the pretzel appetizer to start (fantastic). The main courses we had were ok (tourtiere and fish&chips). Desserts were phenomenal - the cheesecake was the best and the chocolate salted caramel cake was excellent too.   Will definitely return again - even if just for the desserts and beer."}
{"text":"The idea for this bar location above the UP express is great, but like a previous review mentioned, the service was so slow. Given that it's a lounge where people are on the go, I'm surprised at how slow the service was. Not only that, but our server was completely unenthused and disinterested in everything it seemed.   The food was okay, but very small portions given the price. $10 nachos was a very small platter (seemed like there were about 20 chips). $14 wings were about 8 wings that didn't taste very good. I felt a bit ill the rest of the evening.   A glass was broken by the entry way and it took a LONG time before any staff came over to check it out and clean the area."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and had beers, the pierogies and shrimp tacos. Food was great. Great beer selection. The bartenders were friendly but VERY slow... took awhile to order."}
{"text":"Have been to the Mill St. Brewery in Ottawa and it is always good so decided to go to the original in Toronto.  I ordered my go-to app Pulled Pork Carnitas and a pint of Tankhouse and was blown away.   Best Carnitas ever, and huge!  They are part of the appetizer menu, but these were big enough to be a full meal.  Twice the size as the ones I get at Mill St. in Ottawa.  Beer was good as always.  Very nice building, good service. Would come back."}
{"text":"A great spot in the Distillery District.  Great brick surrounding and beer.   Try the Organic and friends enjoyed their fruit special brews."}
{"text":"Everytime we go to the Mill Street Brewery, the same thing is always said - \"Why did we come here?\".  More times than not, we have had crappy service, the food didn't come quickly, or there was always some problem within a larger group.  They often sell out of their specials really quickly....  almost like they put food on special to get rid of it.  And the prices are fairly high for the quality."}
{"text":"Really nice place for a casual meal.  The food is good, if a little on the pricy side, and the atmosphere is warm.  I've had good service here every time I have been.  The beer is terrific and this winter the Vanilla Porter is a must try."}
{"text":"I came here once for dinner in the summer with my sister and my cousin from NYC who loves visting the Distillery every year she comes. I have a gluten-sensitivity so beer and anything cooked in beer was off-limits, therefore I don't have much to say about their beer selection.   However, I want to note that their Spicy Red Thai Mussels were TO DIE FOR. I have to say they are the best mussels I've had so far. You get a HUGE portion - enough to share with 3 (when I go back next, I am definitely getting my own though), and for a very reasonable price of $12.   From what I remember, it took a while for a server to come take our order, but the mussels made up for it. We also ordered the Flat Iron Cobb Salad which was nothing special, and the Asian Beef Taco which I didn't try because of my sensitivty.  Overall, cannot wait to go back and have those delicious mussles all to my self!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here in February to check out how Toronto does beer.  We started off with the beer sampler.  The coffee porter was fair, though a little lighter and more in the nose than we'd prefer.  The organic lager was nothing to write home about, pretty standard as far as lagers go.  While it's not our favorite style we're happy it was organic.  The pale ale was among the best we've had in Canada (unfortunately haven't sampled more Canadian beer).  It had a good balance between hops and malt.  Also good was the stout, which had distinguishable but not overbearing sesame.  We chased the sampler with the stout and pale ale."}
{"text":"When you've shlepped all the way to the Distillery District (so that your out-of-town friend can stuff her chocoholic face with gourmet truffles at Soma), your dining options are kind of limited. The Boiler House wasn't open for lunch so we ended up here.  We had a 15-minute wait for a two-top. The hostess will let you leave the restaurant and come back later, but she will not call your cell phone to let you know that your table is ready. Probably because it'd be a logistical nightmare to keep track of everyone or perhaps because she'd bung up dialing a 10-digit number, seeing as how she spelled my name as SUZAN.*  We came back and our table was \"ready,\" meaning the table was cleared but not set so when our delicious hot, buttery baked pretzels ($5 for two) and basket of sweet potato fries ($7) arrived, we had to ask for...and then wait a while for napkins to wipe off our sticky, greasy fingers.  20 minutes later, when my spicy red Thai curry mussels ($12) arrived, I had to ask for...and then wait a while again for a fork. The curried broth was nice but way too many of the mussels were undercooked and slimy. Ew.  The place is huge and was packed full of tourists that day (mostly men from what I presume are places where people eat a lot of food, don't exercise, and never get direct sun exposure)...so I can see why the waitresses would be absent-minded. They were most likely hired to look good in tight tops and miniskirts, and not so much for their hash-slinging experience.*  Bah, whatever, Mill St. Brewery is not a fine-dining establishment and all I would expect from it is good beer. On that, they deliver. I had their \"award-winning\" Tankhouse Pale Ale ($6 for 20 oz.) from a newly-changed keg which yielded a sumptuously creamy head and a lovely orange peel aroma in the beer. My friend was equally impressed with her Mill St. Extra Special Bitter (ESB).  BOTTOM LINE: Great beer; not worth a special trip for a meal but has adequate bar food if you happen to be in the area, served by babelicious waitresses. This place is like Hooters for beer snobs.  Beer: 4 stars Food: 3 stars Service: 2 stars  ______________ * Bet you didn't know that I could be such a judgmental asshole, did you?** ______________ ** You probably did."}
{"text":"Beer me here!!  But...  pass on the food.    This place is a great place to have a drink whether it be meeting up with some friends after work and enjoy the day outside or to do a brewery tour and learn about their brewing process and what exactly goes into their beer.    The beers are great (with the organic being my favourite and the coffee house porter being the most interesting).  Samples are available inside for you to try and they have the product there for purchase as well.  You cannot go wrong, I am pretty sure you will find something that you like there, and the staff are more than happy to tell you about the beer as you sip away!  Now for the eats....  The atmosphere inside is busy so make sure that if you are looking to eat here, make a reservation since this place does get full (and stay full) during the summer.  But given the food here, I would take a hard pass and fill myself up with some food elsewhere.  Here's why.    On a hot summer day the beer does go down that much easier, but they didn't seem to have enough air conditioning in the place.  Be prepared for not just the food to cook but for yourself to feel hot as well.    As for the food, it was very very average, stuff that you would see at a typical bar.  The chicken wrap was as average as they come, putting it on par with a Swiss Chalet (but hey, I love that Chalet sauce!!)  The lobster macaroni was very good, but a rather small portion size.  The disappointing part was the mess my wife and friend's cobb salad came in.  Nothing was cut up properly.  The salad looked like an assembly line had thrown it together with huge uncut pieces of bacon, avocado that was scooped out and thrown onto the salad.  My wife and friend didn't realize that this was an assemble-the-food-yourself!   Overall, food that can be found at most pubs, but for a premium.    I will come back, but only to engage in the liquid portion of my diet."}
{"text":"You come here for the beer, and Mill Street Brew Pub serves up some nice beers.  I'm not a huge beer drinker, but I will admit that the varieties here are good.  Food is standard pub fare (burgers, fish & chips, etc), which I found to be fairly average.  Service was friendly though slow - the restaurant can be busy, which perhaps explains the slow service.  Probably wouldn't patronize this pub if you're looking specifically for a good meal.  However, if you're in the mood for grabbing a brew and hanging out with friends (which is probably the reason to visit the distillery area!), this is a solid place."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today and it was delightful. I got the elk burger with bacon jam and spicy mayo - it was incredible.  I recommend getting the \"fleet\" of beers, it's a sampling bears of your choice each 8oz!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing menu for after 11:00pm very limited .. Lacking share plates ..but includes beef barley soup? Strange"}
{"text":"I'm giving Mill Street Brewery three stars based on my recent experience having brunch there with a large group.  The brunch menu at the Mill Street Brewery is so-so. You get what you pay for, I guess, because it's also fairly inexpensive.  I went for the poached eggs with salmon, which came with very salty and cold potatoes, 2 slivers of melon and somewhat flavourless salmon. The eggs were done hard. I had ordered soft poached.   I'm not sure about the lunch and dinner food but I honestly wouldn't come here again to eat.   The service, on the other hand, is excellent. (hence the 3 stars) They've got ample staff to take care of a group.  It was really busy on a recent Saturday morning/early afternoon. People love having a few beers and hanging out as it's one of the few restos in The Distillery that's not too pricey."}
{"text":"Beer selection was just OK for being in the distillery district. Food was good though. I ordered the steak frites, my wife got the chicken sandwich. Both were good. The cheese dip was also good. I was pleased with the meal overall. I would return, but there are many other spots I would like to try in the area as well. I would recommend for someone looking for pub fare, with a slight twist on some items, nothing too fancy though.  Atmosphere was good to boot."}
{"text":"They used to have wing night on Tuesdays, or maybe they still call it that but now it's nothing cheap or special.  The wings used to be $. 50 each (great deal for pints and wings once a week), then increased to $ .55 -not such a big deal but now - they are \"by the pound\" so you get 6 wings for $6...... My 4 years of wing nights just ended with that price increase......  In conclusion, they cater to the masses and tourism, which is sad since it's in my neighborhood and I used to frequent here."}
{"text":"I am not sure why Mill St destroyed the opportunity for a first class brew pub. They chose to mimic Kelsey's instead, and added a tad of brewpub to it.  Lose the slutty waitress outfits, the bad music, and cozy the place up."}
{"text":"Had terrible service here tonight. Sat down with 6 friends during Festival Libre, a Cuban themed festival at the Distillery. We were not taken care of for 30 mins and our drinks took forever along with our food.   So why 4-stars?  Once we expressed our displeasure, our waitress actually cared. She didn't just brush us off but went out of our way to comp our food and apologize for the previous service. It was great to see a place that stresses customer service and empowers their employees to help improve customer experiences.  A bad night was rescued and I will still consider the mill street brew pub in the future."}
{"text":"I love going to this place, not only because it is the distillery district but the food here is great. The butter chicken was great with their own unique twist. I was drinking Mill St Organic which I have bought at the beer store many times since I have had it there."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Saturday morning with some friends from Europe. The waitress was very tolerant of waiting almost an hour for us to order food while we chatted and caught up. I had a beermosa to start off which was really good if you're into beer and juice mixes which I am. I ordered the eggs charlotte which is benedict with smoked salmon. It was really good. I also tried their limited time pumpkin ale which is ah-may-zing. We were here for like 4 hours and the waitress was very tolerant of this and didn't rush us which I appreciate (I understand that she could have turned that table twice in that time) The prices were very reasonable as well. I'll definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Went to the Mill Street brew house on Family day for a drink after we walked over to the distillery. I had with me a service dog who I am training for the Canadian Guide Dogs for the Blind.  We were both very welcome here and we felt like the staff were well trained in Guide dog etiquette.  We even got to sample their Stout (Stout is the name of the dog).  Thank you Mill Street for this great experience for us."}
{"text":"Like their slogan says: great beer lives here.  Also a friendly staff and killer food"}
{"text":"I've been to Mill Street Brew Pub a couple of times now and I have to say that I am pleased overall at both the service, and quality of food that I received. To me, it makes a world of a difference to have a chef driven menu which makes use of some of the beers they produce on site. This is no ordinary 'brew pub' type food.  On our second visit, we brought some out of towners for a tour (daily at 4 pm I think) and a taste. They were really impressed because by the time we were ready to order, a 4 beer tasting flight was on special for $6! Since we were also feeling snacky, we demolished the layered dip and the mushroom bruschetta, both were outstanding.  I haven't really found a beer here that rocked my socks yet, but I'm willing to keep on trying until I do.  NOTE: The vet's office next door is super serious about towing vehicles."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times prior but just now writing a review.  I normally enjoy getting the flight of beer but tonight just got the tank house ale.  The food here is delicious and each time I have been satisfied with the food received. I have enjoyed the classic pub fare here and have not been disappointed.  The service tonight was disappointing.  My friend is vegan and ordered the vegetarian burger.  They were all out.  The waitress offered s sandwich with vegetables and cheese but my friend can't eat cheese.  She ended up ordering sweet potato fries and that's it.  The waitress had no suggestions of anything alternative that she could possibly eat.   When we finished eating (still drinking) the waitress slid the dessert menu in front of us ..... Saying nothing.  It was weird.   She just looked at us so we offered to take a look.  When we decided against dessert she brought our bill immediately.  She asked if we wanted change to which we replied yes..... She returns with the change while we continue to enjoy our drinks.  We didn't look at the change as we were still enjoying our drinks.  Then she returns and starts to take all the change while we are still sitting there.  It was a really bizarre dining experience.  We really felt like we had over stayed out welcome.  I think that young woman is in the wrong industry."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and go there once a week for beer and cheap wings.  However when I went last weekend for dinner, I was hugely disappointed.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich.  It was bad, just bad!  The pork was extremely salty and the ut some kind of american cheap cheese on the sandwich. Who puts cheese on a pulled pork sandwich?  Then the fries were so overcooked they were dark brown and hard, and it's not cheap- you pay $15 bucks for this crappy sandwich.  The person I was with ordered a burger and the patty was 2/3 the size of the bun.. just bad..   sadly to say but I won't be going back for a dinner there...."}
{"text":"Ortam biralar güzeldi. Biralar? ö?renmek için dörtlü sampler iyi oluyor. Favorim Tankhouse Ale oldu. Burger fena de?il (3.5/5). Yan?na poutine iyi oluyor.

{"text":"Great beer, poor food, noisy, average service. I was disappointed by the food in an area which has several good eateries I would have expected better. The service was slow and we could barely hear each other due to the noise."}
{"text":"Torontonian's flock to the Christmas Market to get that magical feeling every year. The Mill Street Brewery, enjoying a 150-year-old tradition using a draught beer delivery system pumped through copper encased beer lines, is at the heart of it all. This brewery is tucked away and enshrined in the Victorian Industrial ambiance known as the Distillery District.  The brewery comes with a full-fledged bar, retail store and restaurant. Mill Street is basically known for it's \"big 4\" beers; the ones sold at the LCBO. These consist of the Tank house ale, the stock ale, the Belgian wit, and the coffee porter. There is a plethora of other seasonal beers and award winning craft beers at the actual bar after you finish your samples. They range from organic lager, fruit beers, stouts, Bierschnaps, a traditional German style dry spirit to  Oktoberfests. The service is friendly, knowledgeable and fast. The portions in the pub are generous, so bring an appetite. They also deliver beer. Who knew? Delivery is available for the area between Mill Street to Lakeshore and Parliament Street to Cherry Street.   Ode to Mill Street. Enjoy the little promotional video I made and the rest of the holiday season.   Cheers. Anita Barber    The Distillerys' Chistmas Market This video has been published at http://youtu.be/LPkMm3YvUoA"}
{"text":"I love the brew pub! The board and the brisket burger are great, i love when they bring around some of their new beers as samples for you to try. I'm definitely going to get my name engraved on the MBA Keg! I've always had great wait staff very helpful and friendly. I'll be coming here for a long time, its great!"}
{"text":"Cool pub. I'm a fan of Mill Street beer so I stopped by late one night to check it out. The decor was decent. Service was great. Beer of course is good. I wasn't very hungry so I opted for the chilli. To my pleasant surprise the portion was really decent and it was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm Pumpkin Beer! Always a fun vibe at this place. Not the veg-friendliest menu, but pretty common pub-fare."}
{"text":"So after drinking Mill Street ales for a while now I figured I should make a visit to the Brew Pub for dinner because for some reason I associated quite good (maybe close to great but still quite good) beer with the possibility of quite good food.   I'm not going to waste your time reviewing the beers. I had a sample platter of beers just to confirm that the beer is still quite good. Rumour is their brew-master left a while back and opened Duggan's Brewery which I'll review later. And yes the beer was as expected.   The menu was Kelsey's like as someone else mentioned. Nothing too challenging or creative - just a breadth of items. So I ordered breadth - sampled 2 apps and a lobster grilled cheese sandwich.   Grilled cheese ($16 by the way) had a fair bit of \"lobster\" and a fair bit of cheese which was good - however Restaurant Trick 1: use thin slice multigrain bread and everything in-between looks bigger. One of the slices of bread was more from the butt end of the loaf which means the sandwich didn't fit together perfectly. This can be messy with a grilled cheese. Restaurant Trick 2: use the ends for croutons people!   Sweet potato fries could have been more crisp but creamy dipping sauce was interesting - I think they used some beer in it a la Beer Bistro.   Short ribs appetizer served with cold onion filled coleslaw on a cold plate... Needless to say the ribs were cold in places but still reasonably tasty....after all it is pork.   Shrimp tacos were very good and an interesting mix of flavour. The use of breaded shrimp makes me think that they are also used on other bar platters but still it tasted good.   There are another 10 or so apps and on Mondays they are $5 each. Two apps could make a light dinner and $10 is all I'd really be willing to pay for dinner again here - especially since each beer will run you $7+ after the 3 taxes. Save your money for the beer and save yourself the wait, the beer belching Kelsey's patrons and the 30 min wait for a table."}
{"text":"The Mill Street brewery is located in the distillery district and as a result there is a certain type of clientele that goes here. I am not one of them. However, whenever I am showing guests and visitors around I always take them to the beer sampling area to taste some of the beers that this place makes.   I like Mill Street beers, but the bar, well, is nothing special except for the location."}
{"text":"Came during Christmas Market waited 30 min and was seated in the middle of walking path with empty tables around next to rest room. It was a very awkward table placement. I asked to be moved as other patrons coming and going kept bumping into us much like if you were sitting in an isle seat during a boarding a plane. We were told we could not be re seated. Drink order was incorrect which came after the entre and the 1st course never arrived. So we sat there with no drinks and an entre that looked like a 10 year old plated it not to mention cold. The waiter however was amazing and was able to manage our experience with grace and poise. This rating is in no way a reflection on him. The rest of his team let him down and he was able to keep us smiling regardless. This place is a gamble if you have other available choices for your meal I would opt for other places."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner. It was pretty hectic because of the Christmas Market going on currently so we had to wait about 40 minutes. They have half price apps after 8PM on Monday so we ordered those. I had the short-rib poutine and the pulled pork carnitas. Both were absolutely delectable! For dessert, we shared the carrot cheesecake and the apple crumble. The latter was definitely the tastier of the two. To drink I had an apple cider - I wish they had more options, they only had one.  Service was ok, we ordered drinks and then waited about 15mins to order our food and the waiter was kind of rolling his eyes - but hey if I can get my food for half the price, why wouldn't I! He also forgot a part of my friend's order but was apologetic.  I'm guessing if it wasn't soo busy, the service would have been better, which was really the only downside of my visit."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and enjoyed myself. However, recently the service has been sub-par. The beer is great and I typically am quite fond of their food, the only downfall is the service. Our server appeared quite annoyed when a friend of mine asked a simple question, and she would \"ignore\" us for a quite lengthy period of time.  Otherwise, not bad. I would still suggest going here on the chance that you are lucky enough to have a quality server."}
{"text":"Great beer - had the four x 6 oz options : great way to taste the various house brews.   As for dinner....well.... one of us had the beef dip only to find that it tasted like processed meat.  Disappointing. As for the kids fish and chips - yummy was the word from a 9 year old. And the Creole burger, it was a \"solid 6.5\" - ok pub fare, but not a repeat."}
{"text":"This review is just for the drinks and incredible staff. Came here with my family with a large party. The hostess pushed together tables for us so we could sit in the bar area. Hostess was incredibly friendly and helpful, and I was really impressed with the cider menu (I'm gluten free) and my family all loved their beers. Will definitely return next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"A Saturday night girl's out dinner. It was our second choice and it played out exactly like that. Arrival 8pmish - warmly greeted and informed of a 25 minute wait - we made our way to the end of the bar and ordered drinks from a bartender with a most lovely accent. Friendly crowd. Seated and approached. Good recommendations.   Great company. I had Chicken Pot Pie. Nothing spectacular.   If you are in the area and have to find a place with a loud surround and decent food - this is your place"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance at the bar but not easy to get served.  The cheese fondue was delicious however avoid-at-all-costs the 'crispy duck wings' which are god awful, and soggy.  Disgusting sour marinade and the wings themselves are tough and stringy.  And good luck finding a server to whom you complain.  All in all the best part of Mill St Pub were the other nice ppl at the bar."}
{"text":"Errrrrrrbody be recommending I hit up the distillery district, so thank goodness we had the cutest of lady's to show us around mill st. A-MA-ZING. First off the distillery district? If you have never been, you simply must go. I was there at dark and with everything closed and I still fell in love. We went with the intentions of grabbing wings and a ever so famous vanilla porter. They unfortunately poured the last vanilla porter when we ordered--travesty.    We settled for a round of cobblestone stout and wings to start. Both were phenom. I haven't dabbled much into the world of dark and bitter beers. But I did seem to enjoy this particular brew. I found it smooth with little aftertaste and nutty-ness. The hot wings were so so so good! Even I found them just a touch too hot- how I like them. The bbq ones were pretty tasty as well. Lots of meat on the bone, no anorexic chickens used at mill st.    My boyfriend ordered the grilled flat iron steak sandy, of which he raved about the entire trip. I had a little nibble, for yelp-age sake and I can agree. I had the portobello sandwich as I couldn't resist even the slightest amount of goat cheese. My favorite part had to actually be the fries. Crispy and golden with what appeared to be sea salt. The sandwich itself was yummy, but I felt more goat cheese was needed and a little less portobello.   All around awesome meal. Not to mention the unbelievable atmosphere, Very neat inside with a working fireplace. This was our favorite meal in TO... so far!   I must go back for vanilla porter, I just must. The beer selection is thrrrrrrough the roof."}
{"text":"After a long walk from the St.Lawrence Market to this place (approximately 1.25 miles), the pitcher of beer here were super refreshing (approximately $22.66). Great place to hangout and services were friendly and quick."}
{"text":"+++Nachos.  Get them. The bricks of the distillery district lend charm to the brewery.  Try the stouts.  The Tankhouse Ale -- not so much."}
{"text":"I can't decide if my 4 stars is about the fact that it is the best beer I have ever had in canada.........which really is seriously hard to find, or is it that it is just really great beer.  My first beer was their IPA and um it had that watered down Canada beer taste, but then, THEN i had stout and happiness happened.  The bartendar was a bit defensive when he believed i was a nascar budweiser drinking american, but then i explained how there is a great deal of us who love the microbrews and want to punch most people who drink budweiser in the face, he broke down his walls and started sharing samples with me to find the beer that suited me.  The atmosphere is definitely a brewery and the district it is in really takes you out of that  \"i pretend to hate america, but look at us we are america\" toronto downtown where you practically can drive into a Hardrock cafe and Johnny Rockets at every turn.   I love this area, the cobblestone streets and artist community bring me  joy even in the snow.......in fact, the snow added to the experience.  This makes me want to visit Toronto again.   Not too many TVs to draw the Puck crowd, but just enough to fill the silence.  It's a great place to experience.   Do not listen to google maps if it tells you it is in within walking distance of the Eaton Centre area. It is a lie."}
{"text":"Worst staff  in the world. Unprofessional staff and unexperienced management.   We were a group of 30 people, 1 waitress? The waitress took 45 to an hour to get food orders for my guest, messed up orders in several occasions and disappeard for awhile.   A friend brings a bday gift for me of gummy bear jello shots. Out of nowhere the waitress reappears to tell us to leave along with the manager telling all my guests that we should leave because there was alcohol in the shots. Instead of warning us, they took the unreasonable approach of kicking us out. There wss literally no more alcohol in thos shots than a rum cake.  The stupidest thing is that they added on gratuity to our bills, essentially forcing us to pay the same waitress a tip for kicking us out.   The manager tells us that the gratuity was mentioned when I mad the reservation and on the email sent. Lies.....I double checked that. There was no disclaimer.  Moreover, my guests get wrong bills and some got double charged.  Such a good place. Unfortunately spoiled by the crappy staff."}
{"text":"We came in to sample some beer and maybe have a bite to eat.   We were seated quickly but that's where our story ends.  We waited 15 minutes and weren't even offered water. When we git up to leave the couple at the next table told us they had been waiting for 29 minutes for their bill.   No staff ever came back or challenged us as we left."}
{"text":"The first time I went here was with a group of about 12 people.  It was one of the worst service experiences I've ever sat through (2nd to the time I was mistaken for an American in Rome).  12 of us ordered at the same time, 40 minutes later, half of us received our food. 45 minutes later the other half of us minus two received their food.  By them some people had left.  Eventually the two guys who ordered first received their food.  Irony, the people who ordered first received their food last.  After some insistence to the waitress, the manager was brought over to discuss the problems.  She explained the problem was their ticket system in the kitchen which sounded like they couldn't accommodate large parties.  All of us left with a bad taste, and I was going to write a 1 star review.  But like all good Canadians, we are willing to give a second chance given the right circumstances.  As the group I was with was a Meetup Group, and I know that there are other Toronto Meetup Groups who meet at Mill Street, I think the bad word of mouth would not be good for this restaurant.  We were asked to return for complimentary appetizers.    We returned and were served appetizer platters after our first beer.  So much that we didn't really need to order entrees.  Beer is good, food is adequate(when received), service was semi-redeemed.  I'd still like to see how they deal with a large party with entrees.    I am giving this restaurant 3 stars for their willingness to make amends.  But I probably wouldn't go here especially as I find there are other restaurants at the Distillery district that I prefer."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place twice a month ever since i moved to distillery and i really like the atmosphere. Their duck wings is amazing but to be honest there is not a lot of choices on the menu but their beers is amazing and flavourful. The service is ok a little slow sometimes."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Mill Street Brewery Cuisine: Pub Food Location: Distillery District Address: 55 Mill St Price Range: $10-15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 1 Service: 3 Ambiance: 2 Overall: 2  Extra information:  *Own Mill Street Retail Store *Lots of Beer options *Large seating area *Large screen TVs *Patio seating  I had my doubts going to this restaurant because when I looked up the reviews, a lot of people mentioned how this is more of a drinking place so the food is mediocre. Plus I was going for lunch with a family so I wasn't planning to drink which defeats the purpose of going to a Pub place. However, I've never been to the Distillery District so I thought I might as well give it a try.  The restaurant is very big with a patio outside for seating when the weather is nice. We had to stand around for few minutes until the hostess came and she didn't even greet us properly. This was uncalled for because it wasn't even that busy- plus why have those hostess tables outside when there is so host to guide you in? However, our server was very friendly so that made up for it service wise. The restaurant has high ceiling while gives it a bit of cabin feel- with large screen TVs around this place would be good for large group parties or if you want to drop by for beer.  Ordered: PULLED PORK POUTINE - This is from the Appetizer menu but it was pretty big in size, I guess it's because this is a 'pub' style restaurant? It came with too much gravy on top I couldn't even see the fries or the meat underneath. However, underneath all the gravy, there were lots of pulled pork and cheese on top. Pulled pork was soft and chewy with all the gravy goodness. This was tasty with fresh green onion that was added on top- but when it comes to it, I would choose New York fries poutine over this any day.  Ordered: MEDIUM WINGS(15) - They have Wings special on Tuesdays so we decided to give it a try. They were 50 cents each. This was SO BAD, it was prob the worst wings I've ever had. The sauce was more sweet than sour- which is weird for hot wings. It was luke warm (kind of cold) and dry. I think they prob used the old wings from the day before and then just heated up the sauce and tossed it. The meat was tough and tasteless, it was just horrible! NEVER AGAIN!!  Ordered: FLAT IRON STEAK SANDWICH - This came with fries, coleslaw and a pickle wedge. They cook the steak to your liking so I chose Medium Rare. Caramelized onions inside the sandwich gives it a bit of flavor but the sandwich was overall a little too dry. This def needs some more sauce to balance out the steak in the sandwich with the bread. This was prob the best dish out of 4 if I had to pick one.  Ordered: DISTILLERY BURGER - Apparently this is one of their most popular burger so I decided to give it a try. This was another big disappointment. The burger was so dry and the beef patty was tough and over cooked. Coleslaw is just pieces of cabbage and carrot with no sauce or seasoning whatsoever. I wasn't sure what it was suppose to be? more like a salad without dressing? The fries were just mediocre.  SUMMARY: I guess the reviews were right- this is more of a drinking place and the food is just mediocre. But these days there are so many restaurants with good selection of alcohol PLUS delicious food so I don't think I will ever go back.  *chomp chomp*"}
{"text":"The Mill Street Brewery fills a large space in the Distillery District and features microbrews alongside typical pub grub.  I've never actually eaten here, so I can't speak to the food, but it's a pretty good place to grab a beer if you're in the area.  It can get quite loud and crowded on weekend evenings, though, so if you're looking for a quiet space to enjoy your drink in peace, this might not be the place for you."}
{"text":"Chose this place due to the ample seating and mainly for some beers. Initially got seating inside after being told the wait for the patio was going to be 1.5 hr wait. Got a seat and seriously I found myself in a sauna. Middle of summer and no AC- not cool. Walking around all day in the heat, I just couldn't do it. Told our server we were going to wait for a patio seat after realizing there was ample seating in the back patio. Let's just say the wait was no more than 5 minutes. The servers seemed disorganized and one indicated not knowing how to use the seating app on the iPad.   The service once seated wasn't any better. Did a quick scan of the place and virtually everyone had a burger so thought I'd do the same. Ordered a few beers and a Angus burger to share- expected a monster of a burger and not uber hungry- so yes we split one.  Wasn't asked how I liked our burger and not given an option for a side, the server assumed we wanted standard fries. Disappeared before I could correct the order for a side of sweet potatoes. The burger itself- well done borderline dry. The actual dressings were undetectable and lacking flavour. Your standard lettuce, ketchup, mustard, raw red onion, mayo and a pickle. Let's just say pickle was the dominant flavour. Fries- cold and limp- did not taste fresh.  All in all great patio but only order the beer."}
{"text":"Love Mill Street's seasonal beers.  I always go for a couple pints the fall when the raspberry and pumpkin beer is out. I don't find there are many veggie options, but since I go for the beer, I usually don't mind."}
{"text":"Not a bad place.in the Distillery district.  The area is awesome and somewhere you could probably hang out all day.  The Mill Street Brewery itself is a pretty neat space.  It's pretty large and will remind you of a factory.  There is a lot of seating and they've always been pretty good to us in here.  If you've been to the Ottawa Mill St, this location doesn't have as nice of a view but the interior is absolutely beautiful.  I've been here for a bunch of appetizers and a hamburger.  I think the burger isn't bad.  It's a good size (much larger and less burnt) than what I had in Ottawa.  The wings are solid and they do have a wing night.    In the summer you can sit out on the patio.  I find the staff super nice here and I have never asked for a brewery tour though I should at some time!"}
{"text":"Went here shortly after it opened. The beer selection was ok but the food left a lot to be desired . Wings were tasteless and the perogies had no onions inside!! They asked for feedback and when I mentioned the lack of onion they pointed out onion was on the side !! This is ridiculous . That's like ordering a burger abd receiving ground beef on the side. The guy offered to buy me a beer next time I'm there but after paying a $400 bill this \"gesture\" just made me even more annoyed . I like the way you can see the beer vats though   Edit : after being here several times since id like to upgrade my rating to 4 stars. Looks like they had teething issues when I was there last. Still not too happy about what happened above but I'm liking the growler take out service. 12.50 for 2 litres ain't too shabby"}
{"text":"Great place to grab drinks with friends.   Drinks: Excellent beer selection - They offer a wide assortment of local, international and premium beers.   Food: Pretty standard bar food. The portions are generous.   Atmosphere: Young, fun and busy.   TIP: Visit the tasting room before entering the main bar.  You can sample 4 different draft beers for free there!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for late night dinner. Food was delicious, atmosphere was lively, and the beer selection was good.  Service was friendly and fast. Would definitely visit again.  Close quarters but otherwise very nice."}
{"text":"anyone using American money beware!!!!   No exchange rate and was flat out lied too by a manager( I believe). She refunded my paper money so I could use my AmEx card.  She told me it wouldn't make a difference though.  Wrong. AmEx makes the changes using the current exchange rate. She knew I'm sure.  Also, if a business is going to accept US currency, then you should be responsible to make the proper calibration for the exchange. I like the whole playing dumb routine to make money on vacationers."}
{"text":"Loved it! Excellent food. Excellent service. Great ambience! Down-to-earth, friendly and respectful employees. We felt instantly welcome there. On the plus side, it's Deaf-friendly! I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I dined here a few weeks after moving into the area. We felt like something close and went here for dinner. The food was yummy, we had the spicy beans to share. My fiancée had one of their signature burgers and I got the fish tacos. We each got two ciders as well. The food was overall great, however in my tacos their was a dead fruit fly in my white sauce which sort of turned me off after that, but they were very accommodating and were gladly to either remake my order or just refund my meal. I wasn't that hungry anymore, so I went with the refund. Even though a simple fruit fly ruined my meal, the staff and accommodations were very professional and kind. We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Sat on the back patio here this afternoon.  We were seated immediately, which was fantastic for a hot Saturday afternoon. I had the Cubano sandwich with fresh cut fries, and it was really good, but the fries were slightly underdone. My friend had the beer-brined chicken with parsnip fries and kale and it was excellent.   The Tankhouse Radler was a highlight, as was the Raspberry Lemonade, which is actually a mix of Mill St's Belgian Wit and Lemon Tea Beer with a shot of Raspberry Sourpuss.   The chairs and tables on the patio were very comfortable to sit at, and the food came out very quickly.   I'll definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, and the beer is awesome!  nuff said."}
{"text":"Honestly, fed up with this place.  I live nearby and pop In for lunch sometimes.  The service is terrible which is only matched by the quality of the food.  The burgers have shrunken in size as the price has increased.  The wait staff virtually ignores you as they clean tables all around with nary a glance in your direction.  Never going back after years of giving them my money.  I'll go to El Catrin if I want a nice patio instead."}
{"text":"on our Toronto visit, checked out the Old Distillery District and wanted to rest my tired feet.  Mill Street's patio looked so inviting with their plush patio furniture and cozy fire pits. Great place to kick it and have a glass of wine or beer.  We were stuffed and did not get a chance to try their food so my rating is only based on the ambiance which was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Wish I had read reviews first! Came here with a group a few weeks ago first. No space inside so we outside. Server was very nice to deal with but it became clear after 20 mins or so that our food wasn't coming. We waited so long ( while all the other tables were served) that we were given two free dishes ( fries and pretzel ) at different times. Clear that our order had just been lost but they didn't actually say this. Food when we got it was good and the manager apologized. Both couples were given vouchers for ten dollars off so thought it was worth another try. Went today to use the voucher with my mom. Again staff very nice to deal with. Highchairs are old though and straps not working on one, and bad on second ( couldn't be bothered asking again). Thought all was ok until only my dish and shared fries arrived. When asked, server just said he thought that's what we only ordered one (?). No one asked after if we wanted coffees etc so we just got bill after ten mins waiting. The manager had come up earlier and did stop by after to say hello to baby, but we were already signing bill at that stage so I didn't bother getting into it again. The two stars are for the food which I really like ( potato dumplings were amazing) and for their attempt to make up poor service the first time, but won't be going back in a hurry."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now & both were great. Best wings we've had in the city so far!"}
{"text":"I would recommend this place if you fall into one of these two groups:  1. You are a 20-something wanting to have a beer with friends and eat some relatively affordable junk food.  Or  2. You're parents of a toddler and desperately want to remember what it feels like to go out to a restaurant but, for whatever reason, don't want to use a babysitter and thus bring your little person/people along.  I fall into the latter category. The food was average to poor but what redeems this place (and thus the 3- and not 2-star rating is the fact they were so amenable to having a toddler weave between the servers all night.  I didn't have any expectations so I was neither impressed not disappointed."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I have been here about 10 times and never had food so I can't comment on the food. The beer is always pretty good. This review is based on the past experiences and well as beer we tried last night.   Location and ambience - The location is great. It is located in the heart of touristy distillery district. They have amazing patios out front and to the back as well. It is definitely worth a little extra wait  to be seated at the patio.  Beer - is always great. We tried all three seasonals they had last night - Cassis, Lemon Tea and Belgian Wit. All three were pretty good. Cassis was our favourite.  Price - is very reasonable. The seasonals are priced at 7.50 $ a pint and the regulars at 4.50 $ a pint.   Now let's dissect the three beer:  Belgian Wit - it was pale, crisp and hoppy and had an after-taste. It had orange and spicy taste/flavours to it.  Lemon Tea beer - It was very easy to drink lemon flavoured beer. Think corona with a shot of earl grey tea. Not hoppy at all (probably not a long shelf life too).  Cassis - it was red/orange beer. Looked like a creamy watermelon juice. It looked more like a cocktail than a beer. It had a strong raspberry, sweet-and-sour and hoppy flavour to it. It surprised us pleasantly. Definitely, star of the night."}
{"text":"I came here for a Sunday lunch and got their prime rib burger and their homemade root-beer.  I also tried their regular and sweet potato fries.   The root beer wasn't very carbonated... so I wasn't a big fan.  The burger had several problems.  It came with caramelized onions, but they were completely bland.  The bottom of the bun was completely soggy.  The burger itself felt very fatty.  I realize that on a prime rib they have a fatty part around the edge, but since it was ground up it felt like I had a bunch of fat with every bite.   The fries were OK...  not bad but nothing special.  The sweet potato fries were pretty good, but way too greasy.  The first few bites were good, but after a bit you felt too much grease with each additional fry.  Plus the aioli sauce that came with it was pretty bland."}
{"text":"This is a pub in the distillery district with its own beers. I only tried one beer and I liked it. What I love about this place is its food. It has a good selection of food and with a twist to the traditional pub food items. I ordered a shepherds pie but made with lamb, and it came with a side of kale caesar salad. In terms of drinks, they have several beer cocktails, which I am excited to try next time I visit."}
{"text":"Good beer, distinctively slow service.  Having been here many times over 5 years, amazing what you are willing to forget when you are desperate for different food, due to proximity to the office this is a great place if you can take two hour lunches.  4 co-workers and I went here for a Friday lunch.  Ordering the Drunken Chicken and Basmati rice I finally got my food after a lot of time.  Now I am sure this has happened to everyone at least once.  You are so hungry, pressed for time, that you just eat it and don't bother sending it back.  The rice was cold and clumped together.  Usually a sign that it was microwaved and leftover from the night before that it couldn't be disguised or saved by the chicken and sauce.    The terrible part is when this was mentioned to the server, who was great, who then informed the manager after which NOTHING WAS DONE?!?!??  It wasn't until I walked up the her that she pasted on a fake smile and said I heard your food wasn't good.  I wasn't expecting the food to be comped but to do NOTHING except hope we would leave without a word set all new low for customer service.   She said she was willing to make the dish again.  This was after I went to the, the manager, and brought it to her attention and after spending close to two hours just wasn't going to work.  Well they got my money and I hope they made enough money doing that to customers and in exchange I am happy to post this review.  The server was great but couldn't overcome poor food and mgt."}
{"text":"Mill Street Brewery has a 4.5 star rating here, and I'm failing to see the connection. The atmosphere is typical pub. On the day that we visited (September 10) the temperature outside is 18 degrees, and with the AC cranked it felt cooler inside than it was outside.   Our waitress was friendly, but not exceptional. I've just returned from a trip to Georgia, so perhaps my standards are higher than usual, given that I couldn't have even found a bad thing to say about any of the servers there (even if I tried). Why don't servers in Canada go above and beyond? Especially knowing that we were paying too high of prices for over-rated pub fare!  We had the spinach and artichoke dip to start. The pretzel bread was over cooked and too crunchy. $11.   My friend had the Lobster Mac and Cheese which sounds divine, however it tasted more like regular macaroni and cheese with what really could have been any fish, and no one would know the difference. $19.   My burger was supposed to be some special burger with Swiss cheese, and a mushroom and onion spread. The \"signature\" 9 ounce patty was so over cooked that it was very dry and cardboard might've tasted better. $16.   All in all we were disappointed by the experience. In a city full of great eats, they're going to have to pull up their socks."}
{"text":"Good food and beer but absolutely horrible service by our waitress. The service has gradually gone down hill year over year.  I live in the neighborhood and unfortunately this will be my last visit to Mill Street Brewery."}
{"text":"Um can I say their food was WAY better than expected? We came by on a Tuesday after work (6pm) five of us and even though they didn't have a table that would fit us at the moment, they went to re-arrange tables to accommodate us.  When we sat down, our server informed us that they launched their new menu today and told us about a few specials/popular items. I asked her if she had any beer on nitro and was pleased to know that they do, two types - Mill St. Cobblestone on tap and another one but it's a porter in a can. She gave us a few minutes to go through the menu and came back with samples of the stout on nitro for us (thank you) and we ordered two pitcher of it.  We might have gotten a little ahead of ourselves and ordered too much food but fuck it. We got a poutine (the guys loved it - I thought it was alright), loaded nachos with grilled chicken (the guac was the best part but overall it was very yummy), spicy chipotle burger with sweet potato fries (burger was done perfectly - juicy tender meaty), chicken pot pie with caesar salad (made with kale) (it was good but not this is the shit good) and the brewer's platter - assorted cuts, montery jack, blue cheese, goat cheese, fig and bread (I could have done without this one).  The server was really nice, checked in on us and cleaned up dishes to get them out of the way. I was pleasantly surprised with everything here because I usually do not expect much at pubs/breweries/chain restaurants but this one exceeded my expectations and my whole party agreed as well.   Good job Mill Street, we'll be back for more stout on nitro!"}
{"text":"I should have listed to Yelp before spending our Friday night having dinner here. Let's start with the positives first. This  place is an amazing space in a very cool part of town- the Distilkery District. The outdoor seating section is perfect for a great summer  day. They also have tons of seating inside and would be perfect for a large party. On a busy and sunny Friday evening we were lucky to get an outdoor seat. Our waiter was very friendly and we quickly put in our beer orders. I went with a wheat  beer and my dinner date got a pale ale. I loved that you could get a smaller 12 oz for a lcheaper fee than a large pint. The menu does not have a ton of options- pretty disappointed with their sandwich amd salad selections. I went with the bbq chicken flatbread. I changed my mind after ordering and asked to switch to the margarita flatbread  but unfortunately the kitchen wa not able to switch it on time. Our waiter felt bad and oh well. Unfortunately the chicken on the pizza was not cooked and so pink I had to take it all off. My date had  the fried chicken with jalapeño biscuits which was not good either. The chicken was poor quality and the biscuits were dry. It was served with a tasty slaw.  My advice is skip the food, order a beer and pretzel and have a great evening at this cool brewery."}
{"text":"Mill Street Brunch on a Saturday was packed! For those who don't mind a little hair of the dog, they serve beer pretty early. I just got a coffee to drink.  Of the food options, they are all pretty big portions.  The peameal bacon is really coated in that meal stuff, not that I eat pork anyway.  There is also a benedict with salmon, or off-menu option is eggs florentine with spinach, which is what I ordered.  For a large group, the waitress was really amazing at getting everyone's requests just right. I ordered the sauce on the side, which I always do. But, this was one of the best options ever. The hollandaise sauce was terrible. Everyone else's eggs were smothered in this bright yellow sauce that looks like maybe it had separated a little. Everyone else ate it without complaint, but I dipped one bite in and was happy to eat my poached eggs with salt and pepper alone.  Eggs were a bit firm, but I asked for 'medium' poached eggs.  Beer reviews to come!"}
{"text":"I was blown away by how excellent this place is. The first time I went was after I won a party for me and 10 friends there, and so we had almost everything on the menu. And not one thing we tried could be described as anything less than delicious. The lobster grilled cheese was superb, the beers they brew on site(especially the IPA, my favourite now) were excellent, and the chicken wings they serve here are the best I have ever had, no word of a lie.  Ive gone back since then and plan to go back quite frequently. Our servers have always been hospitable and usually very friendly and helpful when choosing what to try next. Lovely atmosphere, amazing, food and excellent service. And even a gift shop. What more could you ask for? Working on getting your MBA(Master of Beer Appreciation) card is a delightful experience here.   Its also really easy to get there and back via TTC which really helps on Friday nights :P"}
{"text":"FatCat not know the real reason for such bad food at mill street. But FatCat not too shy to speculate. FatCat think the head chef at mill street secretly hate all customers and even Mr Owner of Mill street.  FatCat know how to cook for himself. So he know how much effort needed to make food barely edible. Effort is not too much.  That's why FatCat think head chef making bad food on purpose.  Maybe head chef wait for mill street to close down so head chef can open own restaurant in place. Head chef very sneaky..  Things FatCat like - beer samplers that let FatCat try a little bit of many beers in one go - location  Things FatCat not like - Food. FatCat not too picky, but he have some standards. Mill street not even trying to please any fat cats with food.  FatCat come to mill street to escape another bad restaurant in distillery district. But how humans say?..  Out of frying pan and into fire? Excuse FatCat English. He still learning.  (Restaurant FatCat try to escape name El Catrin..  FatCat also review El Catrin on Yelp)"}
{"text":"We visited Labor Day weekend and stopped in on a Friday afternoon. Despite many shaded tables, we were seated at a table in the hot afternoon sun behind the building. Waited several minutes, but no wait staff even greeted us- a waiter came by a table next to us to deliver drinks but said nothing. We left."}
{"text":"We decided to go to the Distillery for the first Saturday of the Christmas Market. Sadly it is was raining. On the other hand it meant smaller crowds than expected.   At one point the rain was too much so we decided to get out of the rain and try out Mill Street Pub.   Hostess greeted us right away and was able to get us seated within 10 minutes. Remember none of the restaurants take reservation during the Market.    Our server was amazing.  Spent time explaining the menu and the drink selection.    We went with a large nachos with chicken and the pirogies. We all ordered the Organic lager to drink.   Everything was great.   I highly recommend this place. Good drink and food. Nice pub atmosphere, loads of TVs to watch sports."}
{"text":"Food was good, beer was good. We each had one beer and 1 lunch menu item. When I saw the bill was 56CAD I felt lile I got robbed"}
{"text":"Cool space in one of the old distillery alleys.  Really like the area, repurposed industrial campus.  Mill Street offers a bunch of house brews along with standard bar fare.  The IPA was good and on a warm afternoon it was a nice place to park our tired legs for a bit.  Outdoor seating was hard to come by and would seem to be in-demand during the summer."}
{"text":"In November, we decided to visit the Distillery District.  We started the morning with pastries and coffee at Brick Street Bakery.  For lunch, we chose the Mill Street Brew Pub: it's a very good brewpub. The selection of beers brewed on-site is extensive.  If you are adventurous, get a beer flight (or two).  We had the advantage of arriving just as they opened for lunch so there was no wait and the service was good"}
{"text":"The lobster grilled cheese was delicious! So was the pumpkin lager. We're heading back tomorrow to pick up a few six-packs of the tasty beer brewed in the district. Fun, local eatery in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Mill street makes good beer. Service has always been really good. Havent tried much food here so no comment. Will be back"}
{"text":"I'm beginning to love Toronto's distillery district more and more with each and every visit. This past week I ventured to the Mill Street Brewery Pub on Tankhouse Lane within the distillery district to visit the place where my all time favorite beer is crafted. Mill Street Organic.   For a Thursday night the line up outside was deceiving and nearly turned us away, Pro Tip: Check with the hostess on timing for a seat - we did and there no wait whatsoever despite there being a physical line up out front. We were immediately ushered in (also not this place is a well oiled machine in terms of their lines of communication - everyone on headsets directing who needs to be where and for how many) and as we were walked in we were given a mini History of the brewery, MIll St, the brew master and upcoming tours. This guy's Mill Street messaging was tight.  I absolutely love the look of this place, it sort of has an old pub look with a polished edge to it and the whole restaurant/pub is built around the observation windows of the actual brewing area. Some might say this could be an eye sore but the brewery itself is clean well kept and polished you could eat in there. Certainly a sight to be seen.  Also of note in terms of the layout, depending on your group, occasion or your mood you have several options for seating. Mill Street has an amazing Patio that overlooks the busy streets of the distillery district, bar/pub style seating for sports and drinking nights (high top tables and chairs) and more traditional seating for every group size  Being seated and looking over the menu I came to the realization that this place had no shortage of dining options offers either. Everything from traditional pub fare to house specialties AND breakfast/brunch options. Mill Street has got your covered no matter what you're feen'in for.   NOTE: Reading the menu you will discover that most of the menu items involve the use of one of Mill Streets beers in the preparation (beer braised meat, onions sauteed in beer etc etc)  Check before you go for their nightly specials as they all look SWEET, Thursday's right now are home to their $19.99 BBQ Rib special, I wasn't hungry enough for a big rib dinner BUT seeing them come out for others made me regret that decision (I'll be back for these bad boys). The portions look AMAZE-balls!  Our server was fantastic and was both knowledgeable and passionate about the menu and made very strong recommendations when I asked her \"what your top 3 menu items of choice would be?\" After some difficult deliberation we decided to share 3 appetizers to go along with my sensational pints of Organic:  - Pulled Pork tacos with a wasabi creme fresh (3 to a plate, piled high and awesome) - Short Rib Poutine - I know TO is going through a Poutine Renaissance at the moment but this dish is unique in the mix. Wish it had a little more meat to it (it was kinda scarce) - Prosciutto and Fig flat-bread (onions sauteed in beer, blue cheese and arugala) - this thing was the money maker totally recommend it for anyone looking to Nosh a kick ass sharable app  A great time with great food in a GREAT venue all at an extremely reasonable price. I want to come back here many times!"}
{"text":"Checked out Mill Street Brewery and we we're very impressed. Service was great food was amazing and the beer was sooo good. Well after i said all these wonderful things about Mill Street Brewery our waitress settled up with us then we waited approximately 10 to 15 minutes before a manger came up to us asking of we are ok we said we weren't and we would like to order another round. Then it took 5 more minutes more for the other waitress to take our order so a little disappointed. Took the rating of this place from a 5 to a 3."}
{"text":"I was worried we were going to show up and have to wait for brunch on Sunday, but that wasn't the scenario at all since I don't think that many people know it is open! When we arrived we were the only ones on the bar side and were sat right away.  There wasn't a brunch menu, but we were told since they were only open for 3 days (at that time) that there will be one made up in a couple weeks, along with another more extensive menu.  They had a drink special which was a $6 flight, but no food specials. Both of us were in the mood for breakfast so we ordered the croque madam. It was AMAZING, I'd go back pretty much any time of day to have another one.   The service was excellent and the space is really cool. I cannot wait to go back and try more food, beer and just test the atmosphere.  UPDATE: Came back to try more... They were all out of every IPA (which was really lame for a tap house) Tried more of the food (wings, layer dip, calamari - stay away from this one, it was fishy, rubbery and overall not good) the staff were still very accommodating but I had to lower my stars for the beer experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch while visiting Toronto and loved it! He loved the beer and both our meals were great. I had brunch (eggs and avocado) that was delicious. Fun ambiance and good service as well."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar outside, where there was a fire pit and great vibe. Bartender was fantastic allowing us to try the different beers prior to committing to a pint. Loved, loved, loved the elk burger! Massive and delicious, definitely sharable."}
{"text":"4 words:   Prime location. Mediocre food.  I came here during the Christmas Market and I was sorely disappointed. Despite the 1 hour wait, I got served a limp unflavorful angus burger and \"curry from a can\" malaysian curry. Don't know what was so 'angus' about that patty, and there was nothing Malaysian about that curry.   The curry sauce tasted like bbq sauce mixed with sweet and sour and the rice was god awful - it was dry and tasted super stale. I wouldn't be surprised if I found out the rice was sitting in the cellar somewhere, next to shelves of dry goods, getting more and more dried out.   The sweet potato fries was the only item that was worth eating IMO. And it was just a side..  The design of the restaurant is attractive though - high ceilings, distillery themed barrels, kind of reminded me of 3 brewers near Eaton Centre.   Skip the food, and stick with a brew."}
{"text":"I'm surprised of the negative ratings for food here as I came here on vacation with my boyfriend over the Labor Day weekend and was pleasantly surprised by the beer and our food.  I had a chicken wrap and my boyfriend had the plank steak sandwich, both of which were good.  His steak sandwich was really well cooked to his liking which is not something you're always offered in a sandwich.    BUT THE BEER!  I'm from Queens, NY so I'd never had Mill Street beer before but that Wit beer on tap?  Probably the best Hefeweizen on tap I've ever had.  It has the perfect balance of sweetness in an unfiltered beer..  When I go back to Toronto again (which I'm sure I will!) I will go back there.  The only downside is the wait."}
{"text":"Super bar au coeur du quartier de la distillery proposant une large sélection de bières locales. Plats typiquement canadiens (burgers, nachos, ailerons de poulets). Possibilité de visiter les futs utilisés pour fabriquer la bière. Il y aussi un bar à l'entrée permettant de patienter en attendant d'avoir une table."}
{"text":"Place is crowded and seating were cramped.  Did not enjoy the place as I had no seating room.  The BBQ Ribs I got was dry and not saucy enough.   Server did not come check up on us and hard to get a hold of.  They gave us the wrong order and wanted us to check the sandwich (one of us did not want mushrooms) and than they did not take it back. They just gave it to my friend after it been all touched up by another person.  Gross.  Thumbs down for me for sure.  Food took forever and it was not even hot.  Highly disappointed after reading all these great reviews here."}
{"text":"Definitely pub bar food. Options were heavy and service was SLOW.   My friend and I had both ordered one of the specials - perogies - that sounded good but 20 min after I had ordered, they said they only had enough to make one order....so I had to opt out and get something else. Tried their Brewery TOURTIERE - which is kinda like a shepherd's pie / pot pie thing served w a ton of peas on the side. Kinda dry. Not very good.   Calamari was meh as well."}
{"text":"Delicious! When I heard of a new 'beer' place in the neighborhood a few years ago, let me tell you about my enthusiasm. Meh! Beers, tasty but I'm not fancy. Turns out I don't need to have fancy beer tastes because their food is crazy good. I've tried many items, all savory with an incredible flavor I was not expecting. Yes the beer is delicious but the food, I come for the food because damn they've got taste nailed down."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to checking Mill Street out.  I like and drink the beer they sell in liquor stores so I figured a trip here had to be even better.  Nope.  On the plus side I love the concept of the flight of beers.  You get four 5 oz glasses of any of the beers to try.  A great idea to try the wide variety of beers (20+) they have.  Loved that.  Now the not so good.  The food was bad.  Everything was so salty it was unpleasant.  Yes it was a handmade patty but my tongue is still burning and it's been 2 hours already.  The ribs were inedible they were so salty.   I didn't go here expecting fine dining, we were looking for beer and pub food, but they totally dropped the ball.  And then there is the \"patio experience\".  We almost died of heat stroke on the front patio.  No umbrellas, no shading whatsoever and being encased in plexi-glass with no breeze?????? Sadly disappointed overall.  I guess I will just buy their beer at the liquor store.  :("}
{"text":"Told them we were in a rush and they got us in and out in under 1 hour but never made us feel rushed. That is impressive when you are dragging along 4 kids.  By the way, great pub food."}
{"text":"The review is an update since I have tried the food here as well now.  On a weekday we ended up here for a friend's Birthday. Even though we had made a reservation several days in advance it was no where to found initially. We were obviously upset as they said they wait time would be well over an hour since we were a somewhat larger group. When we pressed a bit and found out there are two lists for reservation somehow!! and they hadn't coordinated so hence the mix up. Anyway odd mistake on their behalf as we did get our table eventually. After dropping off the menu the server just disappeared. We had to flag her to get our orders in. Then again a disappearing act was performed by the server with no follow up for refills. By the time we got our orders in we were starving. I hadn't read good things about food here so decided to play it safe and stuck to a the Lane Burger. Other diners ordered a mix of fish n chips, chicken and salmon dishes.  The food took its time coming in.  The main attraction of beer which brings one here isn't the same as the Beer Hall next door. They didn't have the Minimus Dubbel that I liked (I don't like Mill's style of beers so I am not a fan) The burger arrived, though it looked hefty was bone dry as it was way overcooked and there wasn't enough fat content in the pattie. The beef rib and blue cheese didn't save it. The fries weren't good either. I would say very poor food for a pub. The setup though very nice doesn't go far enough to compensate for the weak food here. Poor service doesn't help much either. The location will keep bringing people here so I guess they don't need to improve otherwise this is a sorry excuse for a pub."}
{"text":"I booked a month in advance for a 15-person birthday gathering - we were looking for a place with food and drinks that wouldn't kick us out or limit our seating time on a Friday evening. Brew pub means good selection of beer with classic pub food favs right? For the big Mill Street name, I was sadly disappointed.  We arrived on time and the table was ready and set for us. This worked perfectly as it was a surprise gathering and people were showing up a bit staggered, but fortunately they didn't demand everyone be present before giving us the table. The setup put us near the back of the dining area out of the way of other patrons, giving us some space to mix and mingle. The waiters were accommodating and patient with us, so that was nice.   Once we settled in we sought to order drinks and food - it was dinner time after all! Drinks were quickly taken care of and arrived timely, but getting our food order in became a challenge. Some people were indecisive and needed an extra minute - which turned into an extra half hour before any waiters came back. Then the joy of waiting began. I understand drinks are integral to the restaurant's fare, but for the time we showed up - 7pm - I really thought food would be regarded more importantly. The food took forever to show up, and most of us ordered basic fare like the Friday special fish and chips, burgers, and fries. There was nothing with a lot of customization or anything off-menu that could've taken so long! When the food finally showed up we were famished.  The calamari turned out to be a sizeable portion that was quite good - a food highlight. Tater tots that came with the burgers were also a hit at the table, which was unexpected. Aside that, the fish, the burgers, the sandwiches, the fries, were all sub-par. Nothing to write about except don't have your hopes up.  I'll be back for happy hour and if I'm grabbing just beer with a group of friends, but I bet the Distillery District has much more to offer. I was super grateful for them handling the large group on a Friday and being super patient with us, but I definitely won't be back for meals."}
{"text":"Waited for the server to take the order but she just ignored me and my spouse, not once but thrice. Sat on for another 16 mins (entry time 5.10pm today) and left (5.16 pm). While leaving the manager apologized and the usher asked if everything was ok? well no. no one bothered to even notice us. Had I been paranoid I would have assumed the server had some problem with me. Anyways I hope someone there reads this review and retrospects."}
{"text":"We came for dinner because our cousins wanted cider. This place was super cute and fun! We got seated for four with a baby within 10 minutes of walking in around 7pm on a Friday night. We were given the option to sit on the patio but was hot so we decided to sit inside for dinner. The patio Seemed like a great place to hang out all afternoon with friends. Our table was nicely situated in between two walls of tvs where we got to watch football and hockey.   Throwing this out there before we get into all the good stuff! The only disappointing thing was all the fruit flies! They attacked all the time!   Menu is two sides and pretty simple. We ended up with An elk burger, 2 BBQ sandwiches, the duck app and a bowl of ramen. Drinks were a four beer flight and two peach ciders. Food and drinks all came pretty fast and our waitress was super nice and friendly. Peach cider was not as sweet as I thought it would be but it was definitely very peachy!   We would definitely head back for an afternoon of day drinking and visiting with friends and family."}
{"text":"Super Atmosphäre,  mit Blick auf den Braukessel innen. Draußen nett angelegter großer Biergarten inmitten des Distillery Districts. Massig Biersorten zum Probieren und die Nacho-Platte ist der Hammer. Personal sehr nett und Preise angemessen. WC's sehr sauber und sogar ein Kamin war angeheizt.  Wir hatten einen super Abend hier."}
{"text":"Given the fact that yesterday was stupid cold and we needed a place to warm up quickly, we hopped into the Mill Street Brewery for some \"rib sticking eats\" (as my BF so eloquently said).  It was quite packed given it was so bone chilling cold out and no one seemed to be minding the coldness they ensued to get there. Maybe it was due to the friendly servers or perhaps it was because they could see their beer being made before their very eyes.. Nevertheless, despite the hustle and bustle we were able to grab a table immediately.  The coffee was continually flowing which made us all happy considering our frozen fingers. I ordered the fish and chips. I really liked the fish but the chips were a bit soggy. Not sure if they had been sitting a bit or just because they were presented under the fish... (hmm thoughts to ponder). My BF and my father both order the Mill Pot (with all of the goodness from a variety of animals.) I tried a taste and the only thing lacking was a bun to soak up the excess goodness at the end. (maybe they are open to suggestions?!)  Overall it was a good experience and I have every intention of making an effort to get to the Distillery more. It's such a gem within a chaotic city"}
{"text":"Real good atmosphere with music and friendly staff. Their food here may be the hidden gem. A diverse menu with exotic flavors. We tried the majority in the group we had. Each testing each other's plates."}
{"text":"We came late on a Monday evening and were seated very quickly. Despite it being very crowded, our server was attentive and the food and drinks came out at a decent pace. We found the prices good.  We took advantage of their 6$ CAN appetizers and ordered almost every single one of them... and were pretty much filled up. The appetizers were: fried calamari, brewers flat bread, spinach dip, and sweet potato fries. The calamari were nicely seasoned. The flat bread was the best of the bunch. The appetizer portions were good sized.  Additionally, we got the lobster club and the portobello sandwich plus a flight of brews."}
{"text":"This place is great, right at the heart of the distillery district,  you can grab local brewed beers for a relatively decent price.  The place looks awesome inside and reminds me a lot of the 3 Brewers in Montreal.  The atmosphere is busy and rumbling, as you would expect from a place like this.   Service is fast and the food and drinks come out quickly.  The range and different beers, hard liquor and wines are fantastic and the prices are relatively good compared to everything else nearby.  The food however is not the greatest I've had.  We ordered a number of things, but the nachos in particular were wet and soggy.  Overall I would come back here for drinks, but would probably eat somewhere else in the distillery district."}
{"text":"PUB or HALL?   Hall was noisy and not too friendly if you wanted to actually have a conversation with your friends if you wanted to but it was clean and crisp and had a good layout!   Meeting for girls night we chose the quieter PUB side as we like to chatterbox the night away! We got a table right away which was nice for a Saturday night.   I like the fact that where you eat you can also see the hops where they make their signature home brew! I also liked the fact that you could get a fleet of choices of smaller glassed beer selections to try.   On my fleet was 1. Vanilla Porter 2. Organic Lager 3. Frambozen 4. Wit Lager All delicious but I was partial to the Wit and Organic!   I had the Spinach artichoke dip with a pretzel bread loaf.. It was too salty for my tastebuds and so I just ended up eating the bread which was warm and chew and delicious. I also had the Saffron Mussels, they were good but I guess being a little bit of a mussels snob I thought the saffron sauce was a little off my palate.   Ending with some delicious Molten Lava Chocolate Cake! But again you need to add ice cream for $2 to an already $8 dessert?? I didn't like that part.   Besides the beer which was delicious, I found the food to be average I would come again but i'll be trying something else to eat next time.   :)"}
{"text":"On our way to see Cirque, we popped into the Distillery District for some quick eats and beer.  It was extremely busy for a Tuesday evening. Luckily our timing was good and we got a 2-person table on the back patio immediately.  Coffee porter brew was tasty and I had my usual Mill St. Organic. Service was alright. We had the usual pub fare - Brie Quesadilla ($12) and Steak skewers ($10). However, the shrimp tacos were not that great - probably some better items would be their interesting Poutines (pulled pork & chicken).  If you're looking for the typical pub food, Mill Street meets the standard; however, nothing really exciting in the menu choices. Good beer, nice atmosphere and a TON of indoor seating."}
{"text":"The brew top notch. The food was good. The service was fair. Could have had another star if our server appeared to at least seemed to be somewhat happy we were there."}
{"text":"Two of us went here after walking around in the distillery district. We had the organic beer and the cider and were very impressed. Only ordered fries for food and they came very quickly and tasted pretty good (then again it's tough to mess up fries).   The beer was good, the atmosphere was great and the workers were as friendly as they get. Can't wait to go back and order food."}
{"text":"Admittedly I'm mostly creating this review so I can add Mill Street Brewery to my list of best beer on tap in Toronto.   This place is great! Tasters are available for their wide range of beer - including their under appreciated Wit with a slight orange and cilantro flavour.  The staff are typically helpful and generous with the tasters but you can also purchase decent food and beer if the tasters are not enough for you.   I've overdue for a trip back but it's a fun place - the most fun place in the Distillery and pretty awesome. The food could stand some improvements but I certainly don't go here for the food."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'll say it now, I don't enjoy beer. I only went here because I was hanging out with old family friends and we wanted to have a guys night out. He'd been here before so he thought we should try it out, and I had to say I was extremely impressed.   We went for the tour and enjoyed the flight of beer at the end, including the beer schnapps, which was new. The tour was fun. Even if you don't like drinking, you can learn some neat history and cool facts about beer and about the restaurant. Seeing the tanks and how the beer is made and distilled was by far one of the coolest things I ever seen. After that, we were given a small bit of the beer schnapps, which was strong and then allowed to choose from 4 beers.  They were better than I expected. The beers were a bit mellower than something like a Corona and it was definitely worth it.   If you like to enjoy a good drink, great service and high quality products make this a great place to go."}
{"text":"Mill Street Brew Pub is the only brewery in Toronto's lovely Distillery District, which is the kind of place you might expect to find a few options for afternoon beers. My husband and I were in a brewery mood when we visited the area a couple Sundays back, and decided to check this place out despite the unenthusiastic Yelp reviews.  The pub was huge, with plentiful seating, and we were able to get a table with ease at about four in the afternoon. The vibe was comfortable and casual, if a bit bland in a chain restaurant kind of way. There was table service, and our server was polite and helpful. We decided to kick back and share a flight, picking four beers off the extensive menu. They came in 2 oz. tasters presented on one of those brewery paddles with the holes for the tiny glasses.  We picked the 100th Meridian, an amber lager, and three IPAs--the Welter Weight Session IPA, the Tankenstein, and the I.P.A. (unless it's an intentional distinguisher for the generically named IPA, the punctuation here is irritatingly inconsistent). These were all fine, though none of them were particularly delicious.  We had a nice enough time at Mill Street Brew Pub, but given its status as the only brewery in this adorable district, it was kind of disappointing. I'd recommend it if you're in the mood for beer while you're in the area, but you might do better drinking elsewhere."}
{"text":"Actually 2.5 stars.  The parking for this location is a bit of a pain, but luckily we managed to get one of the last few spots available on the street. From there it was a few minutes walk to get to the restaurant area.  Walking around, it was very clean and felt very different from anywhere else we experienced in toronto. The lighting was good, it was lively, and you could see the CN Tower in the distance.  Once we found the Mill Street Brew Pub, we decided to go inside and give it a shot. I got the stargazers beer - which wasn't bad at all. They had lots of options for beer so it was hard to decide. We also tried the jerk chicken quesadilla, which I didn't like at all. It was also fairly pricey for the quantity of food. If I ever go back, I will get someone else on the menu for sure.  Overall, this particular restaurant was average at best, but the area that it was in was absolutely beautiful. We will be back."}
{"text":"FINALLY! Yelp for CANADA!   As one of my favorite spots in Toronto, the Mill Street Brewery is MUST each time I go to the Distillery District. Great microbrewery with the most friendly and helpful staff to enjoy tastings with.   The Organic, Coffee Porter and Belgium will bring all sorts of happy to your taste buds. Food is okay, so don't expect a fancy meal here as you'll most likely just order a burger and fries to go with the alky."}
{"text":"Fun brew pub! After wandering around the Distillery District and checking out all the booths at the little market they had, Mill St Brew Pub was an excellent way to end our day. We only went for drinks, so this review is only speaking to the beer service, not the food.  Overall it was a really good experience! I can echo what some others have said with the hosts/hostesses being kind of awkward when it comes to seating people. We told them that it was our first time and we just wanted beer and they told us to go find a seat at the bar, but it might be full. Then we went to a different host/hostess desk near the bar in the back, and were told that we could only be seated in one area, even though we asked to be seated in another. All in all just confusing I guess - not really sure what happened but we got a seat so I can't really complain.   Our server was AMAZING! She was super friendly, very very knowledgable, and so nice. She brought us a sample of one of their beers, she explained in detail the beers they had, and helped us make a selection based on the beers we typically enjoy. Because of all the detail and how great the beer sounded, we ended up each getting a flight and sharing from there - we wanted to try them all!   In terms of beers - most were really really good! The cask at the time was good but they served it warm which is just a hard thing to get used to. I am a big lover of stouts and unfortunately this stout was not great - very watery and thin. The Tankhouse was my favorite and the Wit was loved all around.   If you find yourself in the Distillery District and want a beer - definitely come here!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Toronto. It a place that I have to bring people when they come to visit. Both the Beer Hall and Brew Pub have great food its just a matter of do you want bar food or \"fancier\" food choices. The brew tour is awesome. The tour guide was really knowledgeable about the history of Mill St and the whole brewing process. The brew tour was $10, you sign up at the souvenir shop. Included in the price of the tour is a 6oz beer flight (6oz of 4 different beers) and a sample of one of their 3 beerschnapps, which I thought smelled and tasted like tequila, and it went down like tequila too. Service is decent, but there's always room for improvement. The middle-aged female manager was great and gave us the whole scoop about Toronto Beer Week (Sept 13-21, 2013) and gave us the \"Passport\" booklet so that we knew all the businesses that were participating and where they were located with a brief description of each place too. The booklet even broke them up into chapters and each chapter was a different part of the city. So say you're in the Downtown Core, there's a chapter for that.   Bottom line, definitely worth going to this place and trying some new beers, getting a bite to eat and going on a tour, given every half hour. And if you're walking around Mill Street on the weekends you may even run into a lucky couple that is having their wedding pictures taken among the beautiful brick."}
{"text":"I'm rating the food here, as the beer was fine today.   We came on the way to YYZ. Service was ok, but the food we ordered was not. Pulled pork panini was cold inside with chemical taste. Waldorf salad was dressed with vanilla yogurt and sickly sweet with chicken breast that was disappointing. Kids pizza was soggy and not touched by our kids or us. Overall, one of the worst food experiences I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great beer. Horrific table service that will destroy your evening.   I have been going to Mill Street Brew Pub for over 6 years and have always enjoyed the beer, patio and the atmosphere. It is one of the more casual and well priced options in the Distillery. My most recent visit has turned me off of ever coming back. The service has gone downhill to the point where it makes the entire dining experience totally unpleasant. I went to dinner with my in future in laws last night for my birthday, and I told the server it was my birthday. All of the drinks were brought to the table but mine and I ended up waiting over 15 minutes and making 2 visits to the bar before I finally got my drink! Very awkward to have everyone at the table waiting to toast me. There were long waits to order drinks (to the point I had to ask the host where our server was) and it made what was meant to be a relaxing and celebratory evening very unpleasant. We felt that we were constantly flagging bus boys for missing plates or things to put under the legs of our wobbly tables. Te table was upside down at one point and no one batted an eyelash.   The servers all seem very inexperienced and spread too thin. I've experienced bad service here before but this was enough to finally turn me off forever. I was embarrassed I brought them there. I recommended this place on my wedding website - it is coming off! Still enjoy the beer though-  this place is good for bar service only. They could use more vegetarian options on the menu as well."}
{"text":"Really fun atmosphere, and the beer flights are awesome! There's so many beers to choose from.   Honestly, the food was just alright. The menu didn't have very much to choose from that sounded appetizing and there was no real theme. I would have expected pub food, instead I was faced with Indian, some Latin and French sandwich cuisine. I wouldn't go for the food."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on a Friday night. Menu looked great and there was a queue for a table so we thought it would be good. We were told there was a 20-30 minute wait for table but we ended up waiting 40 minutes without a word of apology and having watched pretty much every other party seated within a few minutes and dozens of couples seated who turned up and didn't have to wait. We were waiting for a table for 4 and by the time they had seated the tenth couple I was very annoyed as all they had to do was push two tables together - furthermore there were 3 tables for 4 people empty when we were finally seated. Our orders were taken for drinks and food very quickly but the waitress was as sour as anything and did not smile once. Our food took over 30 minutes to arrive - no idea why, and there was no apology for the long wait. The food was very good except that the rib eye steak was fatty and very chewy. The Bosc pear salad was great and the chicken superb. My husband's meal was meant to have mash which was missing. The burger was also very good. Price was reasonable but the service was very poor - disappointingly for a restaurant in the Distillery district."}
{"text":"Nice place, located in the heart of the Distillery District. Good beer selection.  I had the wit beer and enjoyed it a lot. It was perfect after being out and about on a hot summer day. The food seems to be a hit or miss though. I had the Jerk Chicken Quesadilla and found it rather uninspiring. The kettle chips also left a lot to be desired and their Angus burger seemed quite small. The falafel were OK although I have had better. So I was not too impressed, however I know people who have eaten well here. Service is great though. The waitress was very attentive and friendly and once I was ready to pay the bill came in no time."}
{"text":"Absolute WORST service I have had at a restaurant in a long time.   My group of 16 arrived on Saturday evening at 7pm to celebrate my friend's big 3-0. We were told it would be a 1.5-2hr wait. No problem - we would go elsewhere for drinks and then come back to Mill St. for dinner. We're easy people to please. We just want good food and awesome beer.   We went across the street to the Mexican place. After about an an hour and fifteen minutes one of the guys went over to ask if they were still on track with the timing as it was starting to rain and he just wanted to let the group know. The hostess was beyond rude. White eyeliner, brunette, hair in a ponytail. She said that she told us it would be 1.5hrs to 2hrs and that we would get a text when it was ready. It had only been just over an hour blah blah blah. He explained his reasoning and she pretty much told him that for all she knows it could be three hours. So much attitude.   We decide to keep waiting. Guac is pretty good at the other place. Around the two hour mark, a different friend went to ask how much longer as it was absolutely down pouring and it was around the time they originally quoted us. The same girl told our friend that they obviously took a party of 60 over us and it would now be a 3-4 hour wait. Excuse me?! We had our name on the list. We were quoted a time. We were extremely kind to her, no attitude, we're all adults here, but she was beyond rude.   Thankfully the rest of the party outside had taken it upon themselves to call and book a table at a place down on the Esplanade while my friend was in Mill St., so we went there instead.   Best part, we NEVER got a text from Mill St. saying they had a table for us.   We've been going there for birthday celebrations for friends for years. 100% we won't be in the future."}
{"text":"This place is MASSIVE. Even with a small line we were seated livery quickly. Sitting outside was fantastic as we took in the brewery district and the brides of the weekend walking by. The food selection was good. My pasta was ok, nothing special though. The menu may be too big to focus on anything special. I was interested in the artisanal toast though! Service was a little slow but he place is huge and their were lots of staff on."}
{"text":"First time here a few days ago.   Ordered a candy apple martini - huge, strong and delish - well worth the $9.20 I paid for it.   Nachos for food - MASSIVE portion. Couldn't even finish between the three of us.   Ambiance - awesome. Very authentic, lots to look at, well lit. I'd totally love to do a shoot in here.   Service - bang on! Server was friendly, attentive and accommodating."}
{"text":"My surfer and I went there so he could try out the micro brews.. He ordered the Nachos and Pretzels from the App's part of the menu. He ordered the \"drunken meat\" for the nachos!! OMG!! they were amazing!! Why have I not had the nachos there before!! My new favourite place for nachos!! The pretzels were awesome.. I did try the mustard dip, it was good."}
{"text":"Happened to chance upon this beautiful pub located in a corner of the distillery district. It had a nice ambience & we were welcomed by the attentive and friendly staff. They gave us a sample beer to try on & explained to us the various specials. I loved the Vanilla flavoured beer & u couldn't get enough of it. Food was pretty decent too but slightly expensive. Not a wide variety of options though. Overall, it's a great place if you love to chill on the weekends with your mates"}
{"text":"Got a heads up that this place open after popping by Union Station. Figured it would be a good place to situate a small group on a Monday morning while waiting for a colleague to arrive. Seems to be a good option that is a bit closer than Steam Whistle, and you get a good taste of one of the more familiar breweries available from the Toronto area. In a decent location close to Via Rail, Go Transit, TTC, and the Union Pearson Express.   As you towards the Union Pearson Express you a greeted with the Mill St sign on the ramp. From there you can take the stairs to their lounge where you get some seating, a place to hang your coat, an electric fireplace to sit in front of, and lastly the small bar. There is also Free Wifi for patrons new to the country and USB / 120V plugs for getting some productivity. You can also see the status of the UPE on the status screens in the lounge.  Upon being greeted by the menu; they have an option for a Mill St flight with their beers on tap. Grabbed their Tankhouse Ale while seemed to be a good choice for the time. Smooth and had a good little bit of malty flavor. Also grabbed their Nachos which came on a wooden tray with some sweet peppers, nacho cheese, and some jalapenos. Overall the beer is what you would come to expect out of Mill St, and the nachos were okay with a good crisp.  Overall I would say it is a good place to sit out and grab a snack or even a sandwich with a beer. For what they have it is not bad with $5 beers, with the appetizers/food a little pricey. Due to the food cost, I would rate this a 3.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Location: 55 Mill St (Distillery District) Price: $$$ Service: Good  This was the first time that I went to the distillery district and it won't be the last. This time of year is way too cold for the patio (at least for me), but their patio area is massive. The inside of the restaurant is bright and welcoming they have two selection to the place. One of the selection has elevated chairs and tables (probably not good for children), however the other selection the seats and tables are lower. They have an open kitchen which is always interesting to see at restaurants! They offer samples of beer which was yummy (I forgot the name *sad*).  I believe that they have a different menu for the seasons compared to the summer menu. I thought I will be adventurous and try their elk burger. Personally, if you do not like lamb or sheep (like me)....the elk burger is not a road you'll like to go down. The elk burger itself is half beef and half elk (if I'm not mistaken), therefore the burger didn't have such a strong taste of elk. I thought it was good, but I'm not a fan of the taste to begin with. But those who like/love lamb you will be in it for a treat, it is more juicy than a regular burger. Of course my favourite part of this order was the frites! Their fries are hand cut and it was crispy on the outside soft on the inside..  Verdict: Must Go"}
{"text":"Our waiter Scott was awesome! Very knowledgable about beers and the menu. We had a flight and a beermosa which was delish! Wings ok, (not crispy enough or enough sauce) but Chicken tacos really good! Great stop in the Distillery District for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Very poor experience! We stopped by for a quick bite to eat and to try a few new beers. Not only did it take more than an hour to get our food, when it came, it was cold and mediocre at best. To add insult to injury, we're fairly certain our waitress forgot about us! She never returned to our table to give us our check! We finally got fed up and went to find someone to help us. I was so frustrated with the poor service that this was The first time I have ever not left a tip.   My advice, spend your time and money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love the patio, good beers on tap, interesting beer-cocktails, but the food leavesuch to be desired. Ordered the new charcuterie platter; for $24 the selection was pretty plain - jalapeño cheddar cheese slices, kielbasa sausage, summer sausage, and a pepper crusted salami paired with a trio of spreads: bacon ranch (good), pear jelly (too sweet), and a beer spiked grainy mustard (lacking in flavourful and bite). The jerk chicken fajita was very, very blank, especially for a dish including the word \"jerk\". Next time I'll try the pretzel bread with cheese dip the couple a few tables down had, they looked like they enjoyed it. Great place for having beers on the patio, but don't come hungry."}
{"text":"As an avid beer drinker and visiting Toronto, I had to make my way down to Mill St. in the distillery district. Mill St. is the largest restaurant/bar in this area and they have lots of beer and food to make everyone in your group happy.   I came to sample beers and they offer 4 8oz samples in their flight for like $12. Thats 32oz of your choice of craft beer for just $12. They also offer a 4 6oz for cheaper (I think 8). The beer selection is, as you would expect, great. They have their core beers, like the Tank House and Organic as well as a handful of season beers to try.   Beer enthusiasts should plan on bringing DD as you can spend a lot of time trying all the different beers. Depending on the weekend, they open up the brewery to an informal 'open house' of sorts where you can ask questions about the beer making process or learn more about Mill St Brewery.   Also note that this side of the Mill St. gets packed in the afternoons on the weekends. Head over to Mill St. beer hall for more space."}
{"text":"Mill Street is always reliable in an area of high-priced competition.  Definitely more casual than its neighbors, I've always enjoyed coming here.   Most recent visit was last week before the theatre.  We tried a couple of seasonal drafts from their large selection, both which were refreshing.  We also shared some appetizers that were quite good.  The menu is fairly pub consistent but the food always comes out looking and tasting good.  Service is usually pretty good here especially since it can be so busy (and the place is so big).  It can be a tad loud in the room, particularly if the live music is happening, but it's a great social place to enjoy a meal.  Pretty sure it was one of Toronto's first microbreweries and it's still going strong."}
{"text":"In the heart of the distillery restaurant there is a venue you would expect, a brewery. It's a large restaurant/brewery that looks like it could host 150 people for dinner and more to watch games. We ordered beers all around, I got a smoky porter that was pleasing and my friend got a sampler plate that he enjoyed. The bartender had a typical bearded brewery look was friendly and prompt. Luckily this place won't have its license withdrawn for brewing without a beard  Price were reasonable, i got a beer for $7.50."}
{"text":"Located in a beautiful Distilery District, Mill St brewery has been known for their pretty nice selection of local brews. The food is also pretty decent, a bit different from a standard pub food, for example, a poutine comes with montreal smoked meet to their poutine.. not bad at all.. nachos are yummy!"}
{"text":"Worst Service ever! 30 minutes sitting on the patio to get served one drink. Waiter never came back for an hour after."}
{"text":"We've been there for having lunch. Great location in the Historic Distillery District.  We had a nice waiter who recommended us the super special delicious Poutine. And it was very delicious! The flight of 4 beers was great to split (better split on a hot summer day...) and some nice selection of beer   Quite expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"Great food and beer. My boyfriend and I had the Mushroom flatbread to share and it was VERY tasty. It had mushrooms I'd never tried before. For drinks we ordered the 6oz flight of 4 beers (Stargazer, Wit, Vanilla Porter, and Tankhouse). The Stargazer and the Wit Beer are lighter and on the fruiter side which I enjoyed very much. You have to try the vanilla porter, mostly because it actually taste like vanilla - really smooth taste for a heavier beer. The Tankhouse is aggressive but I'm also not a heavy beer drinker.  Our server was really stellar. Super conversational, offered her take on some menu items when I told her I was a vegetarian and was just all around attentive."}
{"text":"Food is ok but not that great.  I was expecting more from a restaurant inside the Distillery District.  I know the main attraction is the beer, but people need to eat as well.  I wish they could improve their food."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! A sweet spot to drop by before A Jays game for a quick bite and drink! They have a ton of usb outlets and plugs along the tables so you can charge your phone or tablet while waiting! The prices are typical of a bar and the food is nothing special but really you come here because every where else is super busy before a Jays game and you are Super happy you have this bar all to yourself!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer & great food! In the summer, the outside patio is great. Unfortunately, the wait for the patio can get very long."}
{"text":"Location: The Distillery district.  The place: The pub is in a historic building, thus adding to its charm. I didn't go inside because there was room on the terrace  and it was a gorgeous day. If you're going on a warm day, I definitely recommend sitting outside so that you can people watch. Do note that this place attracts a lot of tourists and tends to be quite busy in the summer.   The goods: Beer. No, really - this is why you come here. Since I'm not a beer drinker, I can't offer firsthand knowledge, however I was with a beer connoisseur who gave the beer two thumbs up. I ordered the sweet potato fries and they rocked. Crispy on the outside and semi-firm on the inside. Served piping hot with a beer aioli. Yum.  Service: Good.   Price point: Tourist trap expensive. I can't remember how much the beer was but the fries were something like $8-9 which is probably double the price of what they should be."}
{"text":"I went here during the Light Show Event so it was a pretty busy night. Surprisingly the wait was less than an hour so we were happy. They were able to text my phone when the table was ready so my friends and I could explore the light show while we waited.  The interior had a welcoming feel to it. The staff was super helpful and nice. For a busy night the service was decent. The food was amazing! I got the spicy curry and it was true to the spice. I loved it though. A recommendation when visiting the Distillery District."}
{"text":"Mill street brewery is located in the historic distillery district and is located in the middle of everything the area has to offer!  With the recent expansion of the beer hall, this creates the perfect outdoor drinking experience to socialize with friends.  The beer is great, anything from light to dark to fruity and everything in between they have it! I prefer the cobblestone stout, vanilla porter and the quentinsential classic, the tank house ale (my preference of course, I'm a dark beer drinker) a great selection offered indeed! They also offer a beer tour here which cost $10. It's very very short about 20 minutes long and is held solely in the one room where they brew the beer in the middle of the  dining area. Here they show you the hops, chocolate, barley amongst other ingredients to smell, hold and yes even taste. After the tour, the group walks out to the beer hall and you take a seat at the reserved tables to sample beers. What's great is, they basically give you a flight of 4 six ounce beers and you top it off with a mini beer mug shot of beerschnapps. Yes I did say beerschnapps. Once you finished, you keep the shot glass mug to take home as a souvenir. Not a bad price at all for everything!  The food here is solid as well, in addition to the dining room and the beer hall, there's plenty of places to sit and enjoy dinner! Great stuff all around here!   I'll definitely be back to mill street brewery! There's so much to see and do along with enjoying a brew or two! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We had a late dinner but wanted to check out the scene in the Historic District... We came across the cutest stores and decided to grab a drink. So glad we did!! Nice staff and service was quick and efficient. We ordered green beans and a kale spinach salad as a late night snack instead of the normal nachos with everything on top!! We were happy campers. Not a light beer fan but Canada has some really great beers I tell yah... NO PRESERVATIVES!! I definitely will be visiting often if we can. First time here and it won't be the last!!"}
{"text":"We can't tell you about the food, but we did sample the beer.  It is very good beer with all types for different brews.  We like hoppy beer, so the West Coast IPA was our favorite. Please, go and explore the variety."}
{"text":"We visited Mill Street for some drinks before get dinner at El Catrin.  The prices aren't too bad for the Distillery District and they have a good variety of beers on offer.  In terms of food, they have your standard pub fare.  It was really packed and since we weren't eating we didn't mind sitting up at the bar.  The bartender was attentive and regularly asked if we were good for drinks.  They have plenty of screens if you're interested in watching some sports.  I will definitely return to try their Beer and Cheese Sampling one Thursday night.  It's a great pub and it's worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"If you want to have dinner and drinks here on a Saturday night, be prepared to wait at least 30-45 minutes.  Luckily, we were.  The bar space was very crowded, but we found a bench near the front of the restaurant that was empty so camped out there while we waited for a table.  I like that you also have the option to wander the Distillery until your table is available, however we were waiting for more people so decided to stay put.  And it was cold.    We were seated and immediately asked for our drink orders, even though I didn't see a drink menu (do they have one?).  I asked for water until I could make a decision.  The waiter came back with the brews for the boys and recommended the Mill Street Organic when I told him my preferences.  It was a good recommendation, I liked it - but I'm still wondering if there's an actual menu or if we're expected to know what's available.    Since I wasn't too hungry, I decided on the shrimp tacos from the appetizers menu.  I received three soft tacos, with a healthy dollop of filling in each.  The problem came when I tried to fold them - either they were toasted too much or a little stale, because the wrap kept ripping and was very difficult to fold.  Also, the sauce was very watery in consistency so it was impossible to eat it without making a mess on my hands and the plate.  It was pretty good, but I would have enjoyed more heat and less onion flavour.    The atmosphere is classic Distillery - high ceilings with exposed ducts and beams.  It's also VERY loud.   All in all, a fun relaxed vibe with good beer and decent food.  I'd definitely go back if someone else wanted to, but I'm not likely to be the one to suggest it."}
{"text":"Standard pub food mixed with beer inspired extras such as \"beer drenched cedar planked salmon\".  The prices were reasonable compared to neighboring competitors.  Service: This place only takes a handful of reservations to allow room for walk-in's.  We were quoted a 45 min wait at the restaurant after being denied a reservation over the phone.  We wandered around the Distillery District shops for 15 minutes until our table pager rang.  The service was friendly, prompt, attractive and attentive.  A+ for the wait staff.  Drinks: Cryptic tasting platters that feature 4 small glasses of beer are the easiest way to sample what is brewed on site.  Compared to other micro breweries that I've visited, I was a little disappointed that the beer didn't taste better.  I didn't want a 2nd glass of anything so I continued to happily sample everything.  Only one of the beers that I tried (of some 10 different flavors) had a fresh out of the cask taste.  The other 9 had the same marinated taste shared by common kegs available anywhere.  Food: The food was adequate but not outstanding.  Laminated menus offered standard pre-frozen burgers, small pieces of fish, and familiar fries presented as you'd expect in any bar.  It's disappointing only because if the menu and presentation of the food was improved, this place could be one of the best watering holes in the city.  Would I go back: I'll go back to the Mill Street Brewery if I'm in the area and in the mood for a beer and conversation.  I won't go back if I'm looking for a special meal or something out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Great brews and great food! Their seasonal beers are delicious. Ordered the ginger beef chow mein and it was amazing. Recommend this place fire sure!"}
{"text":"I had a great time at Mill St with a friend visiting from out of town! It was my first time eating/drinking here, although I had heard lots of great stuff about it before.   The beer was delicious, the service and atmosphere was friendly and fun, the food was slightly overpriced for pub fare but still pretty good. Compared to the other very expensive distillery district restaurant Mill st is much cheaper.   I had no complaints and my friend only had one: The drinks are too expensive unless you're buying beer. Her tiny martini was over $10. My suggestion, since drink-wise Mill St is known for their beer, don't come here for anything but!  You can buy cases of the beer they make in house!"}
{"text":"This place was a bit frustrating to get info on and to make reservations. So i called the number and you encounter a phone tree, press 1 for Beer Hall, press 2 for Brew Pub, 3 for retail store etc. How are customers supposed to know what the difference is between the Brew Pub and the Beer Hall? Turns out the Brew Pub is more casual, and the Beer Hall is more upscale. Cool, i wanted to make reservations at the Beer Hall for 13 people. She says I need to call another number 416.533.8368 for all groups larger then 10 to talk to Eleasha the group bookings coordinator. I called her at 5 times throughout the day and night and she never picked up, so I left a voicemail and she called me back the next day. I then had to call her again for more information etc. Shouldn't be this difficult just to make reservations. You guys should try Opentable automated reservations 24/7!   I also wanted to book a tour of the brewery, the person at the Retails store states that reservations for tours can't be made in advance. it's first-come first served. But Elasha says that a group of 20 has already filled the 5pm time slot. Maybe that group was wedding related but very frustrating as a customer when the retail store says no reservations for tours and then to have the time slot booked up in advance!  On to the dinner service my reservation was in the Beer Hall and my group arrived at 6pm but some guests had gone to the Brew Pub by accident, and the hostess there didn't even bother to say to my guests check the Beer Hall. They simply said \"no we don't have any reservation\". How can a restaurant not even be able to communicate reservations for the 2 parts of the restaurant? Our server I didn't catch her name but she had blonde hair took our food and drink orders fine. She said she was going to split the bill but didn't and wasn't even able to correct the problem. My date had to take the total bill to each guest and ask them what they ordered. Even after we gave back the bill with each item and a name beside it took her 15 min to bring the separated bill back to us. Then she was tending to another table for 15min and I had to flag down a manager to get them to process payments. By this time the restaurant is half-empty.   The food itself was okay I had the flat bread kind of like a pizza nothing special. The pork board was well liked. The sausage dish was way too small for $14, please increase the size of this dish! Will not be returning again until they fix some of these issues. The server deserved poor tips, maybe she will improve or management gets rid of her. Also emailing this to Mill St as well. Thumbs down from me!"}
{"text":"Parents are in town and I brought them here for a late patio lunch on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Exceptionally friendly service combined with a vibrant atmosphere. Food was standard pub fare with a good dose of innovation - delicious and great value for money. The mussels and watermelon salad were excellent. All in all the folks at Mill Street despite the crowds made my and my parents day :)."}
{"text":"Came down here for the lights festival, so we decided to have dinner here. Probably the worst idea during the time, the pub was jam packed. We had to fit 6 people around two tiny bar tables. It was so tight, I couldn't piss to save my life.  Anyway, Victoria, the one that took our orders was great. She was super nice and very friendly. Although awesome, she didn't come too often. I assume the reason for that was the craziness trying to please other customers.  The food was good, not spectacular. I ordered the meat loaf - super yummy but super salty. The meat was soft and melted in my mouth. Just thinking about it makes me salivate lol I paired it with a recommended drink and it was awesome. I don't remember what the drink is called though :(   3.5 stars this visit, due to the lack of attention we had. I know it wasn't her fault, but there could've been more effort put into stopping by to ask how we were doing."}
{"text":"The Distillery is actually wayyyy cooler than anything that was recommended by a tourist book can be expected to be.  I was able to cruise right up to the bar early on a Saturday evening and order drinks without having to box out.  I was sceptical of the Lemon Tea Ale, but man it was tasty.  Tasty enough to where I wish I had more time to taste their regular wheat beer.  The Helles Bock was also pretty tasty."}
{"text":"It was so much better than I expected. I thought it would be just some glorified pub food, which is was, but it was tasty and good value for money (for the most part).  We came earlier for their brewery tour. It wasn't a tour, more an educational talk. Since their expansion in the last ten years, they have moved their brewery to another facility in Scarborough but their experimental and some select beers are brewed here, and served in the restaurant (great test audience). I won't describe too much of it, and leave it for you to experience.   You meet in their retail store, a small little space if you have a big group. You can get some samples of 4 of their beers. If you're familiar with the brand, you've probably have these before (tankhouse, organic, stock ale and coffee porter). They do sell beer here, as well as Mill St paraphernalia (bottle openers, magnets, t shirts, mugs etc). They also sell 1.89L of the raseberry infused beer. A great souvenir is the beer mug/beer combo (on sale today for $4.95, usually $6.95).   After the tour, we had a reservation for foods. Although it's a big restaurant, the area we got seated in was really cramped. Maybe we just had too many people, and our big fluffy parks didn't help. There are coat hooks, but are minimal.   The food itself was pretty good. I don't think I've ever had sweet potato fries this good. It's got some batter around the ouiside, making it crunchy on the outside and sweet on the inside. Tastes so good,don't even need dip.   We ordered ($5) the baked pretzel with dip. It was yummy, I think I didn't even share and ate both pretzels, if I remember right. Was quite intoxicated.   I got the Crock pot ($18). Although really good, not really worth the money. It's got some sausage, duck and beef in a stew with potatoes and gnocchi. It's super filling. But i don't think it was worth $18 at all.   On the other hand, AT got the sweet potato lamb and fig sheppard's pie, toped with gouda. Not only was it unique, it was extremely tasty and only $13. Comes with a salad.   Others got the Chicken and Leek pot pie. I think it was tasty, but awfully filling and the ladies dining with me had to take half home.   We didn't order dessert, but the birthday girl got a nice warm chocolate molten cake. Great size, and very warm. I would recommend.   As for drinks, the pints are about $6.40, but they do have 3 flights of half pints for $8. Tasty, but I was annoyed that my fruity beer was switched for mill st's god awful lemon tea beer. As a light weight, I liked being able to try them all and that's all the drinks i needed.   The only issue was that at the end of the evening, we wanted a change of environment for another drink, but there's nothing else in the area (except Sterling room, but at 9pm, the evening hadn't begun and cover was $20). Balzac's and Soma had closed, and there was no where else to go. I mean, i guess people would be coming here!  Free parking on Parliament Street, free after 4pm on weekends, and 6pm on weekdays."}
{"text":"The patio was nice, we had pork belly and cottage cheese pie, both were good. It's a good place to go out with you are checking out the area!"}
{"text":"Could not have been more disappointed. Yesterday was our first night in Toronto and the distillery district was first on our list! As beer enthusiasts my husband and I were so excited to come to try the variety of beers.   There was a wait, so we sat at the bar and enjoyed a beer. I had the Belgian Wit and he the one the ales. Both were delicious. Shortly after we were picked up by the hostess and sat in a section where the server was already waiting on a PARTY of 30!! Why? Why would they seat us in a this section? Clearly, the server would not be able to give us any attention.   We ordered an app which was delicious then we did not see her again for about 15 mins. We she came back we ordered entrees and another round of drinks. When my husband asked to order a flight of beers she told him that they were out of two of this beers (she didn't specify which) and instead of suggesting others, she TOLD him she would get him a Scotch ale. I got my beer right away but my husbands beer came about 10 mins later followed by our food 30 mins later. When our food arrived it was cold like it had been sitting at a heat lamp for a while. Likely because she was waiting on a big party. We didn't even bother sending it back because we knew we wouldn't eat if we didn't.   We didn't see her again for a while since the large party needed her attention. Finally a colleague of hers dropped off our check. She came back around to thanks us at the end and was not apologetic whatsoever.   Not a great way to kick off our vacation. Luckily for us we went for drinks afterward at El Catrin nearby and were greater with open arms and quality service. Mill Street: where is the teamwork? I waited tables for years. If one of the servers was busy, the whole team should be chipping in!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection including decent beer hall food. Will definitely recommend going there ones in Toronto."}
{"text":"Here's a copy of an email I wrote to the restaurant two days ago:  To the management:  Hello.  On Sunday at about 12:45pm, I went to your Brew Pub to get something to eat, and have a beer. (Cheque #23796) I ordered the Angus burger and a pint of Tankhouse.  Does anyone at your restaurant actually eat this \"food\"? I work in the service industry and have eaten at many restaurants, and yours has to be the worst burger I've had in Toronto. A stingy, grey patty, with a smattering of crumb-like fries, neither of which tasted like anything. Well, maybe \"moist dust\" would do. I mean, you must really have to work at it to get food this tasteless. Even the Tankhouse ale I had (which is my favourite draft) didn't have its usual bite.  I'm sure you're coasting along on the fact that people will inevitably stop in, as you're one of the cheaper options in the Distillery. But for a simple meal (that cost, including tax and grat, $31), I expect a lot more. Like taste. And a reasonable portion. And hot food. (The service was fine, nothing more.)   Pick up your game, people. As it is, your food's an embarrassment."}
{"text":"Awesome hidden bar just above the UP express terminal. Perfect place to hit up before a Jays game for food and drinks! Love the fact that this bar is sponsored by CIBC and that if you are a cardholder you get 10% off your food. Way to represent!"}
{"text":"This place is much larger than expected. I had the avocado corn salad for lunch that came in a substantial, impressive portion size and it was really tasty with the curry chicken.   Unfortunately the power went out in the Distillery District at this point so it seemed a bit chaotic however, I'd definitely give this place another shot."}
{"text":"Located in the lovely and quaint Distillery District, Mill Street Brewery is a rare find.  While I am a huge beer fan (one might be hard pressed to find someone as passionate as I am over the hoppy goodness), I am not exactly a fan of Canadian brew.  There are some that I like (Rickards Red being one), but for the most part beers made north of the border lack that aggressive bite I have become accustom to as a US west coast resident.    My first try was the IPA which, back home and in the traditional microbrew style, is my favorite type.  While not as light bodied as, say, an Alexander Keith's, it wasn't IPA as I know and love it.  Good malt, some hops, but just not what I'm used to.  However my next attempt. the Tankhouse Ale, proved to be a real winner.  It is brewed in the American pale ale style and was highly reminiscent of Sierra Nevada, just a bit more malty.  Success!  This was the beer I settled on the rest of the evening.  Food is really good here as well.  Started with a true Canadian classic, poutine.  This particular version featured alfredo sauce and shredded braised short ribs, to complement the fries, cheese curds (from a local Ontario dairy) and brown gravy (deep, rich and excellent).   For an entree, I had the beef pot pie paired with peas and mashed potatoes.  I hearty and satisfying meal.  The space itself is as cool as the district itself.  Lots of brick and dark wood.  We were seated away from the bar area, so the din of the Saturday night crowd was kept to a minimum.   All in all, a great experience and one I will look to repeat next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"I honestly don't think I've ever had a worse brewery/brewpub experience than I did at Mill Street while I was visiting The Great White North from Kansas City. This sad tale starts and ends with the atrocious \"service\" our bartender \"provided.\" Since he didn't offer his name, and I didn't ask, let's call him Chad from here on out.   My lady and I came in mid-afternoon to watch a soccer match, as we had heard this place had pretty good beer, a bunch of TVs, and we were in the Distillery District anyway. No problem sitting down at the bar - plenty of space, and quite a few boxes with both the soccer match and the Blue Jays on. Chad ignores us for a bit (mind you it's a pretty empty bar besides us at this point) before walking over to us, pouring two small samples without saying a word and slams them down in front of us. We ask what it is. He says it's an IPA. The lady hates IPAs. He gives us a weird look, and just walks away without a word or offering a different sample. Well, okay then. I like my hops, so I take one for the team and drink both. He comes back in a bit and immediately asks us what we want. We haven't been given a menu at this point, and with it being our first time in, could have used a bit of an explanation on some of the brews. Instead, he grabs some menus and walks away yet again. Dude's batting .000 so far.  We review the menus for a bit, and the lady has a question about the Lemon Tea beer, asking what kind of style it is and whether the lemon or tea comes through more. Annoyed at our ignorance, Chad replies in the most Chad way possible with, \"It's a beer that tastes like beer.\" Holy. Crap. Man. You've got to be kidding me. If we weren't in the middle of the match already, I would have left at that point. Luckily, we finally got our beers sometime shortly after that (and after being informed they were out of one on the menu...with which Chad gave us a recommendation for a \"similar style\" that wasn't actually similar at all), and Chad mercifully left us alone after that. And by left us alone, I mean he completely disappeared. We had to grab our check from a roaming waitress.  The beer actually was fairly good and would be a 3 star on it's own. Both the Cobblestone Stout and Father John's ESB were solid representations of their style. And, in case you're curious, the Lemon Tea Beer is a fairly sweet wheat beer with an interesting tea flavor and a hint of lemon. With a host of other good breweries in town that all gave us phenomenal service, I can't say I can recommend Mill Street Brew Pub until they hire some people who give a damn about beer and aren't complete douchenozzles. Personally, I'd rather get punched in the face by Joey Bats than ever be \"served\" by Chad again."}
{"text":"Not satisfied with this first-time experience. And it takes me a lot not to be satisfied, I'm generally a good reviewer.  We were a group of two. Service was slow. It was cool outside and no one was offering us to be seated for a few moments, so we went inside to the main desk and waited to be seated. There was a sign saying to go back out to be seated, but it was too cool, so we flagged a waitress to get us seated, who went to find a hostess.  We finally got seated at a really cramped two-seater table in the corner. At least we could see the hockey game. At the entrance of the restaurant while I was waiting to be seated, there was a menu with \"beer cocktails\" on it. When I got to the table and asked to order, the waitress said that that menu wasn't in effect yet and I couldn't order a \"beer cocktail\".  So we ordered two $5 appetizers and two mains. Mine was very poor; It was a the BBQ Chicken special sandwich. A huge bun, with about a cold-cut size slice of chicken in it. The fries it came with were so soggy and soft I was getting sick just looking at them.  The only thing I can say that was good about this meal was the wine that I ordered. Which says a lot about about a place which is supposed to have beer as its flagship item."}
{"text":"Mill Street is a really nice pub in the Distillery District. Good bar area where you can quaff brews and watch sports, plus more than one outdoor patio area. The front patio is a bit more intimate but offers nice 'streetside' ambiance. We sat in one of the back areas which are much larger with more of an 'inside the district' feel.   - Beer flights: Solid. They do good beer here. I enjoyed all the beers I sampled (and I'm not even going to try to list them). - Fish n chips: hot, tasty, maybe a touch greasy for some but with the good fish, just right for me. - Nachos: my companion's choice. She wasn't too impressed but I thought it looked good. Certainly you get a lot of food.    We also had a beer inside while watching (sort of) the NHL playoffs. As I mentioned, a good pub for that.  Service was great, inside and out.  I was only in town for two nights and I'm glad Mill Street was one of the spots I hit. Recommended."}
{"text":"Mill Street Brewery is the perfect spot for relaxing with friends. Right in the middle of the Distillery district lies a great patio serving great food with good service.  Any given sun-day is the optimal day to dine here. Take advantage of there shaded outside seating and cold drinks. I had their homemade root beer. It's good but has less bite than Barq's.   For starters, you have to get the shrimp tacos. The absolute best tacos I've had. 3 fried shrimp on guac and salsa with a tad of spicy aioli wrapped in soft tortilla shells. Goodness, I can have these everyday.   For my entree I had the Steak Sandwich. It's nothing too special here but the steak is cooked to perfection and sliced in between a big onion bin. It's definitely one of the bigger Steak Sandwiches I've had in Toronto. The pickle and coleslaw were good sides to cut through the heavy/creamy bbq and aioli sauces in the sandwich.  My gf had the \"Proper Steak Pot Pie\". She loved it. Served with a side of green peas and mash, it went down well. The portions are large so maybe a doggy bag is in order. But leftovers are always good with a favourite flick.  Overall, I really like the food here. Even though it's standard pub food, it's certainly done right with a few twists. I recommend it for a lunch or dinner on a nice breezy summer's/fall day."}
{"text":"Had some drinks here. I am not a beer drinker but my friend insisted on getting some drinks here! He had a sampler flight of their seasonal beers and loved them all. I had a Long Island ice tea while the wives had martinis. Our drinks were ok.  The building itself is very rustic and was packed!"}
{"text":"While touring the distillery district with my girlfriends family we were recommended to check out the Mill Street Brew Pub. I love the beer and was very excited to experience the brew pub for myself. I waiting staff was very quick and friendly. We were not sure which beer type to get so they provided the whole table with samples of there organic and 100th meridian blends. The food was really delicious and the atmosphere in there was great. It was a lunch that we went for and i can imagine the dinner or weekend crowd makes it an even more vibrant place!"}
{"text":"The patio in back is OK service is kind of slow. Especially considering we came after lunch rush . Good thing they have lots of good beer on tap..."}
{"text":"We found this place on our maiden voyage to the distillery district. Our waitress was fantastic and had lots of knowledge about the beers. We did a flight and several half pints and left happy with all the beers we got to try. The amber and the house red were our favorites. The only reason we aren't giving it a 5 is we didn't eat there."}
{"text":"Used to be decent but it's terrible now--avoid this place. Service is awful.  It used to be good when it opened. The service was great, and the food was surprisingly good, if a bit pricey.  Recently, service has become terrible. I visited a couple of times recently and was completely ignored. You definitely had waiters come to the table before, but I guess now you have to go up to the counter to ask for a menu, go up again to order, go up to pay, then the servers somehow have a right to ask me why I didn't tip? I tip when I receive service--do you tip at McDonalds?  My most recent two visits are the reason this is a 1 star review instead of maybe 2 stars. On one occasion, I came by in the evening, maybe around 7:30PM--their hours said they were still open for several hours after that, but after sitting around for 15 minutes, I finally approached the counter to ask for a menu and was told the kitchen was closed. If the kitchen is closed, they should put a CLOSED sign up, and clearly have their hours show their closing time.  More recently I visited to enjoy a Mill St Draught Root Beer, a delicious non-alcoholic root beer they brew here in Toronto. An oddity for a brewery, but delicious. The employee handed me an alcoholic root beer despite my clearly specifying I wanted the original non alcoholic root beer--their new alcoholic one tastes like sewage. She was very rude and lied to my face, stating Mill St has never made a non alcoholic root beer--I told her I'd had one here before, and she called me a liar. I will never be back."}
{"text":"Good portions, nice and relax place to eat, the waitress was nice, cheap prices, the food was ok, came a little late. Recomend the breakfast skillet"}
{"text":"I had an extremely negative experience  here, which is a shame as the beer we ordered and the short rib poutine were excellent.  I get the vibe they are going for.  Upscale brew pub, little bit on the trendy side, but lets look at the abrupt and unmannerly individuals they have passing as wait staff.  First off, they are wearing polos with ear pieces, not tuxedos, so the haughty attitude could be tolerable if they were at least somewhat competent.  They were not.  Rude and mismanaged,  I have never been so easily dismissed at a restaurant before (let alone a nice-ish brew pub).   We came early on a weekend night looking for dinner.  The hostess-man literally looked us up and down for a solid 15 seconds before asking \"yes?\"  Not hello, not good evening, gentleman, simply \"yes?\"  Alright, hello, how about a table for 2?  \"at least a 45 minute wait.\"  There were no less than 5 tables free in the bar area alone, and I'm not sure how many open in the dining room (we could see at least 1).  We asked if we could sit at the bar while we waited and if something opens up, if they would come get us.  \"you're free to do whatever you want\"  was about as much as we received.  While we waited 40 minutes not only did those tables that were empty when we arrived not get filled, but two more opened.  I went back up to the host man and his accomplice/manager(?) towards the 40 minute mark and asked why there might be open tables since we've been waiting and why isn't it possible that we might, please, get sat?  \"I don't know what to tell you...\" was the answer we received, then silence, then staring.  Not only was I slightly offended I was embarrassed (and confused).  I felt judged and uncomfortable.  Did I do somethign wrong?  Was there crap on my face? Why, Mill Street Brew Pub?  WHY?  Before we signed the check, It took us three tries to get the bartenders attention, and even then not a good evening gentleman or have a good one.  Simply silence while they gave us the bill and charged us.   Now, this could be a purposeful atmosphere that the management is trying to instill with his/her wait staff, a sort of upscale regime being initiated, but it really wasn't that busy, and from what I remember we weren't that improperly dressed (it is after all a brew pub and not upscale dining).  I was left flabbergasted.  Not one friendly smile in the whole house. How?  I eat out a lot, and I love food and good service. I'm not going in to with the intention to clash with anyone's business, but simply put: THERE IS SOMETHING NOT RIGHT WITH THE INDIVIDUALS WORKING HERE UNDER THE GUISE OF SERVICE.  This needs to be addressed and corrected by management across the board.  Very very offensive experience. F."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and well worth the 30-45 minute wait we had for a table of 3 on a Wednesday night.  I was here with colleagues, so I didn't get to sample all of the beers that I would have liked to.  :(  i was only able to pick one since it was on the company's dime so i chose the Franconian Bock...incredible.  Normally when the waitress describes a beer as smooth, I don't really expect it to be.  This description was spot on.  There is no other way to describe it other than - AMAZING!  It is 7% alcohol, so if you're a lightweight and out with colleagues it's not a good idea...however i'm not. :)  Next time I make it to Toronto, I want to try a couple others since the award list seems to be never-ending.  The place was very crowded/busy, but I love that sort of atmosphere.  Our waitress was incredibly nice and helpful for any questions we had about the menu.  We were in a hurry to leave and I swear she got our bill/ran our card in 30 seconds! I don't normally expect much from the food at places such as these.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the Brewer's Crock Pot (i think that's the name) and it surpassed my expectations in every way.  I find it very difficult to take a beef & potato meal and make it exceptional, but this was.  It was essentially a typical midwestern/Irish stew with pot roast, potato and carrots...but they also added in lamb dijon sausage and potato dumplings...delightful!  I'm not good at pinpointing out spices, but whatever they seasoned this dish with was delicious.  All Irish people and folks from Iowa should check out this dish and take it back to their respective homelands...no more bland meat and potato dishes please!!  At one point in the meal I commented that I wanted to move to Toronto just for this dish and the Franconian Bock...and I would (granted anything is better than Des Moines, Iowa)."}
{"text":"This was a nice place to stop for beers and some food. My friend and I were making stops around the Distillery District and this ended up being an appetizer and pitcher of beer place for us.   The beer recommendation based on what we liked was only okay. I wasn't impressed with the server's ability to match beer to a taste. We ordered the poutine with pork on top. I thought that was the highlight of the meal."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my mom on Mother's day. Since it was nice out, we sat in the patio. We were seated quickly and our server came to us in a timely manner. I decided to get Mac n cheese and my mom ordered the chicken tacos.   The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time. The food tasted decent but I'm a little surprised at how small the portions were. My mom enjoyed her tacos though.   Toward the end of our meal, a manager came by and gave all the moms a small gift (Mill St. branded coffee mug with a 20% off next visit coupon). I thought that was a very nice gesture of them and made the overall experience even better."}
{"text":"We only came here for the brewery tour, which was $10 (tour + beer), but we opted for the $15 (tour + beer + beer schnapps tasting).   We came on a Saturday after and were the only ones on the tour, but our guide was SUPER knowledgeable about the history of Mills brewery and answered every single question we had (we had a lot). Really chill dude with origins at Muskoka brewery (forgot his name) and was very generous with the beer. We got the organic lager for the duration of the beer and came back to the bar for four different samples of their draughts, as well as small samples of their beer schnapps.   If you're someone who enjoys beer - I would definitely recommend this tour and come with lots of questions!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places I visited in the Distillery District and I will definitely return.  My biggest regret was eating a late lunch and not having enough room to try all the food!! As we walked to our table, I drooled over the varies charcuterie and cheese platters and other pub grub we saw other diners enjoying.  My companions and I got an order of the duck wings. Highly recommended (I considered ordering even more!) - they had a sweet and salty flavor.  The heirloom tomatoes served with goat cheese were a fresh and vibrant contrast to the wings, but didn't go too well with my beer flight. *shrugs* Oh well.  If you're like me and can't decide on a single beer, opt for the flight of beers - they'll even let you do a large flight (larger 8oz instead of 4oz) if you want to get a bigger sip.  Be sure to check out Mill Street Brew Pub when you're in the Distillery District.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Local beer made right next door not to mention spirits and great pub food (done Toronto style) makes this place a must visit. Their beer flights are good, the bartender helpful and knowledgeable (also handed out free samples which made me buy a bottle of their beer schnapps) and the decor and the area it is located in works together."}
{"text":"Some tips: 1) Make reservations. The local shops close early so it's often a bummer to wait. 2) Half-price apps on Mondays (except Nachos) 3) If it's your first time, look up the location on Google Maps - can be a bit tricky to find if you've never been to the Distillery District  Mill Street's brew pub is a very decent establishment that's fairly consistently good when it comes to food.  Mill St. beer is pretty good too.  It's pretty spacious inside and there's a place to buy Mill St. beer beside the entrance.  The decor is pretty standard for pubs.  Food-wise, our group ordered Fish and Chips, Butter Chicken, Atlantic Salmon and Beer Brined Chicken.  We were all pretty satisfied with our orders.  Nothing stood out as exceptional but nothing was bad either.  The waiter was obviously very busy but considering how busy it was, we still received relatively good service, just slightly longer than expected waits."}
{"text":"Hey. we've got this area called the Distillery District....maybe we should open a really good microbrewery here. You think that would fit?  Yea, I thought so.  I've got to disagree with Vanessa here. I loved my experience at Mill St. although I mainly went for the suds. I first tried Mill St. awhile back at the LCBO with their coffee porter and it was excellent. If it's good in the bottle, it's got to be even better on draft. Andi it is. Even better is their Belgian Wit which is one of the best I've ever tried. Only beer that truly stunk was their fruity beer but it's rare to find a fruity beer that's actually good. I can't speak for the burgers but I probably wouldn't order that here anyway. Soft Pretzels are OK but coming from Philadelphia, you can imagine our model of soft pretzels is drastically different (and much better). Still, I'd head back to the Distillery District just to sample another Wit sometime."}
{"text":"Came here on NYE for a quick bite before heading to a house party. We were reservation-less so we couldn't have Mill Street's NYE menu, but ordering from the menu was just fine.  The ambiance is great. Found in the heart of the Distillery District, Mill Street brews their own beer ready to be served in the dining area. I found the service to be excellent. Our server was an Irish lad who was very efficient and extremely professional. He knew both the food and beer menu well.  All servers should be like this guy.  To start, we ordered the red pepper dip .... it was a-ok. Nothing out of this world, but I still enjoyed eating it. For my meal, I ordered the chicken pot pie accompanied by the Mill Street Lemon Tea Beer. Both of which I thoroughly enjoyed!!  I want to try the pretzels ... I'll have to come back."}
{"text":"I like this place.. when u don't feel like dressing up, when u don't feel like worrying about calorie intake, when u don't feel like going to bier market yet again....  unique old building, interesting selection of beers, decent food for a brewery... great for easy weekend afternoon.."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday. It was pretty packed and the there were several groups that were in the restaurant. They had quite a variety of beers on tap including some local beers. As for food, I got the Chorizo Pot Pie. It wasn't particularly interesting and probably isn't a place you come for the food. The beers on the other hand was pretty interesting."}
{"text":"Great location High energy place Great menu Great food quality  LOVE LOVE LOVED this place  service was good considering how busy this place was  highly recommend, would go here again easily !!"}
{"text":"Came here for a nighttime meal/drink! We were near the area of the Distillery and wanted to have dinner here!   The portions for food were rather expensive, shared plates were ~$13-$15, and were the same size as their burger meals which were about $2 more. I think it was expensive for the size of the portion, but in terms of the price in Distillery District, this was not an expensive meal at all.  I tried the Cassis 9oz and my partner tried the Vanilla 12oz Beer (both $7.50). I loved the Cassis beer cause it had a sweet fruity taste to it. The foam of the vanilla was quite strong and it was a little darker compared to the purpley, pinkish outlook from the Cassis. Either way, both beers were quite delicious,a definite recommend for their beers.  We tried their Spinach Dip ($14) which included a bowl of creamy spinach dip, a few slices of warm flatbread and multi-coloured tortilla chips. I somewhat enjoyed this dish, I thought the flatbread was heated to the right temperature, and I thought the tortilla chips were a splendid add-on to the meal.  We also got the Ontario Angus Burger ($16). This burger was quite petite, the size of a McDonalds Happy Meal Burger with a thicker bun, patty and more lettuce. I thought this bun was rather dry, I wish more sauce was added to the burger. In addition, I wished it was a little hotter, I didn't think the bun was heated to a hot enough temperature.  Other than that, I would really recommend coming for the beer, not so much the food (except maybe the shareables). They also have a cup of LifeSaver mints you can grab after your meal!"}
{"text":"I dig this place. Good food and good beer. The staff are all very nice. Even though the place is busy you don't feel rushed. I really like the way this place is designed as well. Clean and classic. Prices are reasonable and the quality of food is very good. I'd go back here."}
{"text":"Tasty beers, I especially like their finer summer seasonal. I also liked the ESB and IPA. Nice atmosphere, great for sitting outside a historic area and enjoying some local flavor."}
{"text":"I'm still sitting here at the pub and I've already been ticked off enough to write this review. After ordering, I was asked \"are you ok?\" By the waitress working the patio (I guess I sounded like I had attitude). I am a consumer and tourist. I should never be asked that. Then she alluded to the fact that she has to work 15+ hours. Definitely not our issue nor should she have taken her tired frustration on us. Terrible service. But nice atmosphere. Wouldn't return. Wouldn't recommend as there are many more options here."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this brew pub as it reminded me so much of places I like in the US.  So my girlfriend and I went while we were visiting Toronto and, unfortunately, just about every part of my experience here left me unimpressed.  To kick things off there was a piece of glass in my not-so-icy water.  When I informed the hostess (our waiter hadn't been back for about 10 minutes at that point), she looked up like it had dropped from the sky (we were also sitting outside).  I informed her that the far more likely explanation was that somewhere along the line a glass had broken.  She didn't seem to get what I meant.  Against my better judgement I shrugged it off and we asked for a table inside because it was super hot out.  Our experience inside was not much better.  We ordered a sampler of beer, all of which turned out to be not very good.  Everything tasted sort of watered down and flat.  Plus I'm pretty sure our new waiter brought us the wrong beer for one of them.  After we ordered food he didn't show up again until he brought us the check and at that point it wasn't worth complaining.  The food was not very good and very expensive.  All the food came out luke warm. The crab cake sliders were almost all filler, the sweet potato fries were soggy, and the pork tacos were dry.  To put the service into a word: inattentive.  Neither of the \"waiters\" we had seemed to really care that we were there or wanted to help.  We were never asked if we wanted more water or beer.  All in all it was a very disappointing trip."}
{"text":"Here from the states for the weekend. First - the food was way better than I was expecting it to be. We came here for dinner after the place we originally wanted to eat at had too long of a wait. We were able to get a high top table here with no wait. We were here on Friday evening (Canada Day. Very busy!). I ordered the Big Kid Rootbeer, very tasty! I followed that up with one of their seasonal beers, Cassis, which was fruity and delicious. For dinner I had the penne with added chicken. I should note that as a brewery, their menu is VERY small.. Mainly consisting of apps and bar bites, sandwiches, and 6 or so entree choices, but the food and drinks were all quite good. Waitress was a bit quirky but fine overall. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"As a restaurant, this place is a steady 3 stars. I've been a couple times and never really been impressed. I dont even remember what I got when I came here last summer. Thats how unmemorable this place seems to me.   Tuesdays are Half Price Wings now (no longer 55 cents each as previously posted).The wings were a decent size, but only 7 chicken wings in a pound sucks, especially if you're paying $12 for them. Luckily since it was half price and only $6 for the 7 so I certainly wasn't going to complain (which is why I'll stay at 3 stars). Medium sauce were really surprisingly hot. Jerk BBQ were an acquired taste, but I did end up enjoying them.  This is the kinda place I'll visit again, but likely only if I'm already at the Distillery District. If I have to go out of my way, elsewhere in town will be the destination of choice.  Although admittedly, the Beer Hall next door does intrigue me still, and the Mill Street Retail Store on site is the bees knees for long weekend beer needs."}
{"text":"The food definitely does not stack up against the beer.  I really enjoy the distillery district, but next time I go I would definitely opt to try one of the other restaurants in the area for food. This place is just your average grill house chain."}
{"text":"Just meh, which was too bad for where it is.  We ordered a bunch of food and nothing was out the ordinary.  The Poutine was really microwaved tasting and the rest of the stuff just seemed very \"for tourist\" level food.  Food: 1/5, bland and just visually good but MEH  Service: 3/5, good service and attention.  Their seating should change as sitting in the middle table had the server pass me 50+ times behind me throughout my meal.  Ambience: 3/5, good and fun place  Price: 2/5, $15-$20 for what each person got? Perhaps not."}
{"text":"Cozied up to the restaurant bar on a Saturday mid-day to catch some brews, lunch and the Chelsea FC match. Not much of an atmosphere inside (because it was a nice day the patio was hopping). As a result, the service at the bar was great for three of us. We did a few beer samplers and had a combination of brunch/lunch. The light-filled room was really appealing, as was the marriage of shiny aluminum along the bar with the exposed brick walls. The whole Distillery District is pretty cool; they really have tried to preserve a lot of the warehouse feel inside the old buildings.  The beer. Eh, so-so. I would give it 3 stars. A myriad of IPA and saison and wheat selections, none of which differed terribly from the other or had star quality compared to other microbrew faves. Refreshing none the least.   As for the food - I was blown away by the chicken schnitzel sandwich. It was HUGE. The chicken cutlet was breaded and fried perfectly and the mustard aoli dipping sauce on the side was the perfect complement. Crispy outside, moist inside. What took the cake however was the bun. A perfectly toasted Brioche with just the right amount of buttery flavor. So soft. I hate hard rolls. This was wonderful. The fries were good too. If I went back to Mill Street, I'm not sure I'd order something else. Our friend got the Mexican divorced eggs, which looked pretty good (he mentioned were spicy) and my husband tried the breakfast flatbread with bacon, onions and an egg. That was good, too. But oh, that chicken schnitzel sandwich. So simple, and so good!"}
{"text":"Distillery district is one of my favourite parts of downtown toronto, especially at night! Naturally, we came here for our date night. From the love wall, to the strings of twinkly lights.. it's the perfect place. We came to Mill St. because last time we tried to (during christmas market), it was booked full for like 2hrs straight... this time, although it was packed, they had a table for 2 right away.   Walking in, it's SO much larger than it appears from the outside. I like how they have their little beer store/tasting at the front and in the inside, there is a beer hall, where you can see the beer brewery! Our table was quite small and it was beside a coat hanger thing on the wall, which was pretty disturbing since the jackets kept poking into the table and my face. Mill St. is super packed and loud, with about a thousand couples having dates and another thousand groups catching up. They've also got a bar area too. (obviously)  Our server seemed super tired but he was still friendly and did his job well, although he was a bit quiet and it was hard to hear him with the loud chatter around us.   ANYWAYS! THE FOOD.  We had a baked pretzel appie, which was SO good. Think warm NY pretzels with a creamy dipping sauce that I'd sacrifice a child for, and a marinara sauce that my boyfriend fell in love with.  For our entrees, he had this DIY platter thing (forgot what it's called) but it was so cool! You get a few slices of thick cut bread, bowls of different spreads (fig jam, feta cheese, and a few other yummy ones that I'm not sure what they were), thick cut gouda slices, mini sweet pickles and some different types of sausage slices that you can mix and match to make different combos. I've never seen something like this but he was completely satisfied after making his little bread creations. For $23, pretty cool! For myself, I had the cubano, which is a pulled pork panini with dill pickle and other stuff. It was SO good but I couldn't finish it all after having the appetizer. The dill was pretty strong and the pork was great. It comes with fries, which I didn't really care for. $16. We both had beers and I think I really liked the one he picked out (Portage?). They recommend beers with certain dishes and that one worked well with the sausage platter because it had minimal taste while the platter had an explosion of flavours. I had the tankhouse ale, which was good but not my favourite.   I definitely would come back to try the different beers!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night with a party of 9 for my sister's birthday. She had made a reservation for us. I was surprised at how busy it was! There were babies and children in our party and when we were arrived they told us there wasn't any room for the strollers to be at the table with us so we had to park them at the front.   Food and drinks were all right but my experience with the service here this night was not very good. Our server did not bother to notify us that an 18% gratuity would be added on to our bills automatically. While I understand why this is done and can agree with it, sometimes I feel like servers see this as an opportunity to slack off. Our food took ages to get to us, our server forgot drinks... Everything just came off as really subpar.   It's too bad this place sucked. At least Mill St. beer is good..?"}
{"text":"Exploring the Distillery District, my bf and I came across Mill St Brewery and popped in for some drinks and bar food. He ordered a beer flight and loved the beer choices he picked. I forget all the names, but he enjoyed the West Coast IPA the most. I tried their homemade root beer and was surprised to really enjoy it! I'm not usually a big fan of root beer, but it sounded too good to not try. My bf loved it as well and stole sips as often as he could manage.   We ordered the wings with honey garlic sauce and giant soft pretzel. The wings were perfectly crispy with a sweet, sticky sauce that was truly finger licking good! The pretzel with fresh mustard was great as well, although I would have preferred more salt (they used flaked salt rather than traditional pretzel salt) and a beer cheese dip. The mustard was a good accompaniment regardless.   We loved our entire experience and the service here! Can't wait to visit Toronto again and have another great night at this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped here to warm up and grab a bite after a rainy walk through the Distillery district. I first chose the vanilla porter and the fish and chips. The porter was a little thinner bodied that I would normally like, but it was slightly sweet and smooth. The fish and chips were beer battered and perfectly crisp and hot. Probably better than most I've had while abroad in London. A second round of beers led us to a flight of their famous Organic Lager, Oktoberfest, a pumpkin ale, and an Irish stout. Each had unique characteristics that were distinct and fairly tasty. Our waitress was helpful all along the way, and provided prompt service. Overall, a formidable experience you'd expect from a big city brewery."}
{"text":"Located in the Distillery District, it has a nice patio outside, so it's great for catching some sun. They also have an extensive drinks menu (obviously), which features many Mill St beers that are not available anywhere else. I tried the Wit Beer, it has a hint of fruity flavour and is very refreshing for a hot day. I also ordered a jerk chicken quesadilla, which I didn't like. The quesadilla was filled with all cheese, barely any chicken, and I didn't taste the jerk flavour at all. However, I also tried a bit of their burger, and it was pretty tasty. So if you are ordering food there, I would advise to go for a burger, it's the safest bet."}
{"text":"This review is for the tasting and beer shop right at the entrance of the pub. They offer free tastings of the beers on tap that day. I tried 4 different ones, from light to dark. The first one was an organic beer that was very smooth and light, which I loved the best. The last one was also really good. (I think it was called the meridian?) It smelled very fruity and had hints of citrus fruits as you drink it. I wish I remembered the specific names of the beers though.  Our beer guide was very informative and friendly. I'm not a huge fan of beer but he made our tasting experience very enjoyable and memorable. He told us all about the different beers, the history of Mill Street Brewery, and other places to check out in the Distillery District. I'd definitely come back again next time I'm in Toronto to try some of their other beers."}
{"text":"I love Mill street! Amazing local beer and great food! Try the meat and cheese platter it's to die for."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, phenominal beer selection. The menu is small but the items we tried like steak sandwich, turkey club, grilled cheese, cobb sandwich were great. It is a pub place, so don't expect gourmet foods."}
{"text":"This place was worth two visits during our stay in Toronto, but I'm not sure what that says about me.  The service was very friendly and not overly attentive.  The beer sampler plates are a great idea, but no substitutions are allowed.  On our first visit, we had to sit outside and enjoy the sunny weather with their beer samplers.  It was nice and their menu was bar food with a bit more flare which such additions as a buttered chicken dish (aka chicken tikka masala).  This was the first time I've heard chicken tikka masala by another name so I ordered it thinking it was something else, but the dish was all white meat and nicely flavored.  My bf had their special of the night which was roast beef with Yorkshire pudding.  That too was tasty and was serious bang for your buck!  Overall, food was slightly above average but nothing to rave about.  The beers are unique and worth checking out, but don't expect exotic craft beers just well made classic brew types.  Lastly, the service was slow with taking our orders, bringing out our drinks & dinner, it was friendly and apologetic throughout."}
{"text":"This place is pretty rad.  Completely bumping on the Saturday night before Thanksgiving, so there was a 30-40 minute wait, which my friend and I bypassed by taking a high-top.  Rather cramped and crowded in the land of high-tops, but it's not too bad.  It's a great place to stop by after checking out all the amazing shops and galleries in the Distillery District.  Fun, bustling atmosphere, and an eclectic, but decent, music selection.  The brewery nachos are aces (definitely add guacamole).  The veggie burger, however, is not house made (I always ask beforehand), so I opted for the portobello sandwich, which was actually much better than most other portobello sandwiches I've had.  I highly recommend trying a flight of beer.  Among my favorites: Tankhouse Ale, Fruit Beer, IPA, and the ESB.  But the real winners are the two seasonal selections: Octoberfest and Pumpkin Ale.  (Yeah, I drank a lot of beer that night ...)  Definitely check out the shop where they have a stellar selection of t-shirts, koozies, bottle openers, etc., and where you can take home a sixer of Tankhouse Ale (among other options) or a growler of your choice.  You may also sample select brews here."}
{"text":"5/24/2015  Drove up to Toronto from Rochester, NY back in spring to see my friend and decided to stop by for a brunch.  Had some beers and my life changing food called \"Poutine.\"  Basically this is a fries, ham, pickles, and other good stuff loaded on the plate. How can you not like it??  Poutine pairs very well with beers.  It's too bad I wasn't around for long to try other food this place offers.  Until next time! :)"}
{"text":"ughhhhhhhhhhh. make a zero star option PLEASE!  my husband and i came here once in search of decent pub food in the distillery. there was a huge wait and the place was really disorganized. when we finally got seated, he got a burger and fries, and i got a basket of sweet potato fries.  his burger was incredibly bad. i could see just looking at it how tasteless and dry it must have been. he put it down after eating about half, which he never does. my fries were not impressive. they came out cold and weren't flavoured correctly. i ate a handful and then felt kind of sick and stopped.  then he gets to his fries. he's eating them for a minute or so when he picks up a huge knot of hair. one hair is fine-- two, maybe. i'm not that squeamish. but this looked like the basket of fries had been dropped behind the deep fryer and scooped up. within the tangle of hair was a ton of gray, dryer-lint-looking dust. we called over our waiter and he took away the food but then charged us for the whole meal! i was about to vomit and this asshole was going to charge us $35 for a half eaten burger, dust covered fries, and a third of a basket of cold sweet potato fries. we eventually got him to comp it (i think he still charged us for the SP fries), but jeez!  i was nauseated for the entire day and ended up just going home because i couldn't walk around any longer.   probably one of the worst meals i've ever had."}
{"text":"Food is pretty expensive for portion/quality. It's alright. Pricey but has a good beer selection."}
{"text":"Mill St. Organic is a good safe beer choice around Toronto, so I was wondering what their brewpub was like on a recent trip to the Distillery District.  I tried their World Cup special Piri-Piri club sandwich with fries and an ESB, while my companion had the portobello sandwich with the coffee porter.  He found the beer to be virtually flavourless, weak with no body.  My ESB was fine, but not as exciting as I'd hoped.  It started off nicely, but didn't have much of a finish.  The sandwiches were bland and boring.  One piece of leaf lettuce, which was going limp, thin slices of tomato, strangely sliced chicken breast and bacon.  The bacon was the highlight since the chicken didn't fill the bread.  \"Mildly spiced\" = no spice.  The fries were atrocious.  Short and soggy.  As for the coleslaw on the side, putting it on a hot plate will kill it, but it didn't have any flavour anyhow.  The pickle was a nice touch, but it was the highlight of your meal.  Bland and boring.  Wish we'd saved our money and just gone for chocolate at Soma across the street."}
{"text":"Great beer, food, and patio. Im not a huge beer fan but I absolutely LOVE their lemon tea beer. I've never had anything like it. It's light and refreshing but not too sweet. Also, the creamy leek mussels were phenomenal! We sat on the patio which was great because it's sheltered from the wind and even has heaters. We went on Sunday and were pleasantly surprised to learn it was Happy Hour All Day so there were lots of great deals! We tried the $5 burger and it was delicious but a little heavy on the meat with two patties. Their fries were also super good - just the right amount of potato skin, crunch and salt. Overall a great experience for a pub and I would definitely go back for more delicious Lemon Tea Beer!"}
{"text":"14 beers to chose from - including 5 seasonal. Our waiter was pretty knowledgeable and beer was good.   Food was below par. Calamari rings were soggy and nachos - eh... okay i guess. Its tough to spoil them, right?   The wait staff was chatting in the corner while we tried to flag one down."}
{"text":"House wheat beer was solid. Poutine was very good. Harissa grilled chicken was great, though be warned the chutney is spicy. Drunken butter chicken is a very tasty and heavy dish."}
{"text":"GET THE CALAMARI! I am from Charleston, SC (seafood central) and this is the best calamari I have ever had. The beer is also a plus and knowing that they make it all in house just makes it taste that much better. Our server was also great and gave us some places to check out around the city. Just an overall great experience, go check it out and ask for the calamari!"}
{"text":"We loved the restaurant and loved the Distillery District.  The Mussels were delicious, the Kobe Burgers with Oka were also a huge hit.  They were geering up for the Christmas market in the Brewery District and I would strongly suggest it!"}
{"text":"Really good food, quick service and tasty beer.  The inside is light and open with plenty of TVs to catch the game.    I tried their stout which achieved a better chocolate taste than most that try.  For food I had a weekend special they called a British Club.  It was basically a club sandwich, but instead of turkey it had a burger patty.  It was good and the serving size was just right.  My friend had some shrimp tacos and loved them.  I will say our waitress had a robot personality, but I wasn't there to make friends, so it didn't offend me that much.  If I lived in Toronto, I'd add it to my list of regulars."}
{"text":"Not very good. Ask for water, you don't get it. Ask for ketchup, you don't get it. Sup with the biscuits? They're very dry, like burnt bread with no salt. Sup with the brisket? It's slimy.. the texture of moss.. don't get the Welterita for your drink .. taste like a salty, watery Lime-a-Rita... I guess I'm just confused."}
{"text":"UGH I just can't figure out why we all keep coming back here!!!  The menu SOUNDS good... but it never, ever is. NEVER!  I've been here at least half a dozen times by default.  As others have said, it's no so bad if you make half-assed excuses for them, like it's a \"pub\", not a \"restaurant\", or that they focus on beer so their food must suffer a little, or it's just the most affordable option in the Distillery, blah, blah, blah...  One of my pet peeves: Quesadillas that slide apart. COME ON. It's not hard. If I can do it at home, can you PLEASE figure it out since I'm PAYING YOU to know how to COOK THE STUFF that's on YOUR MENU??? Nothing is certifiably terrible, but nothing is even \"great\". Passable, fine, but that's it.  Ahem. Apologies for the all-caps.  What would people say if this was at, say, King & Yonge... or the Ossington strip? Roncesvalles? I can't imagine. It just happens to be located in what a lot of people consider to be a food desert, in terms of dining out. They forget what a short walk it is to King St. E.  Obviously they have a great beer selection, and it's cool to see all the pipes and vats and stuff, but none of that makes up for the mediocre food.  Meet you there next time we're going to a Soulpepper show. You know it's gonna happen. Unavoidable. UGH!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing is all I can really say about Mill Street. My man and I came on Saturday to watch the EuroCup games and try a few beers while visiting Toronto. Since we weren't planning on eating, we decided to sit at the bar (also for a better view). The bartender took at least five minutes to come see us, and immediately asked what we wanted. When we mentioned it was our first time in, he set menus on the bar and walked off. He came back after we'd had a chance to review and I had a question on the Lemon Tea Beer. I hadn't tried beer with black tea before and the lemon made me think it would taste more like a radler or shandy. I asked him about what the flavors might be similar to, if it would be too sweet, and his dead pan response was \"It's a beer that tastes like beer.\" Okkkkay. I can see you're going to be rude here...  I attempted to order something else on the menu, was told it was out, and given a \"similar\" alternate beer recommendation (which was actually nothing in style like the one I tried to order). In the end, I did order the tea beer. It was nice and refreshing, but would have been way more enjoyable without the attitude. We finished watching the game and hadn't seen our bartender in ages. We finally flagged down a gal who was mixing drinks for seated tables to get us our check. I'm not sure if A) our bartender's shift ended and he just didn't tell us, or B) he was too busy being a jackass to continue waiting on his existing customers. Either way, I wouldn't recommend it, nor will be back in the future. I'm sure there are plenty of places in town that serve their beer AND will give you decent service."}
{"text":"Flat bread with mushrooms and truffle oil was delicious, brisket sandwich was bla nothing really exciting :(. The sample of beer they gave us bettlejuice i think it was. Had a super nice fresh flavor, very impress with it. I want to go back only for the flat bread. Take out probably."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch on a Sunday at this location. I ordered a breakfast platter with eggs, bacon, sausage, and potatoes that was excellent. My wife got a yogurt parfait and a beermosa, which is beer and pineapple juice. Our table also ordered a hamburger that had everything on it that was delicious and we tried their mussels. There were many other things that looked great on the menu so it was a tough decision picking and I don't think any of the choices would have been wrong. Our waitress also provided excellent service."}
{"text":"Awesomeness in a chalice!!!! this was PART DEUA....oops Deux of bar hopping.  From Liberty Village we drove east to The Distillery District for a quick drink and food. Though I am not much of a BEER oficionado, I decided take my waiters recommendation and try their special, the Maximus brew.  This gets a PERFECT 10!!! A dark blended beer, with a sweet after taste, that goes down smooth was complete BLISSFULNESS OF BEER IN A CHALICE!....i highly recommend this beer to ALL BEER lovers.......  And of course food without Alcohol is a recipe for disaster, so we played it safe and had Grilled Chicken flat bread which was a 4.5/5.  The portions were quite huge, and the melted cheese and roasted peppers added wholesum goodness to this meal, though the bbq was a bit overpowering, nonetheless it amalgamated all the flavors together.   Overall 4.5/5, the people, service, and knowledgable staff make this place an enjoyable destination for late night food and drink."}
{"text":"I was excited to find out Toronto has a Distillery District. I was hoping for sweet grains awafting, spirits aging and stills as far as the eye could see. I was sadly disappointed finding 2 small nano distilleries and a sake place with a  few breweries and lots of random shopping, cafés and such strewn throughout a somewhat closed off, rather aging, seemingly abandoned warehouse lot. Some DISTILLERY District, Toronto.  We'd come from Hamilton and used bad info on another brewery so we chose the biggest most brew pubish brewery we could find. Mill Street had a solid menu, solid beers.  Small lobby, we chose for bar seats due to a small wait. We belly up and are interested in a variety of beers and food. This turned out to be a solid choice as the bartender was excellent. Thick as oatmeal and sweet as sugar pie, caramel complexion, wait what did we come here for again. Sadly they were out of the hard root beer and quite a few seasonal, we stuck to the staples and were impressed. I'm a man who likes amari's, bitter drinks, but those house schnapps whoooooo boy those got some fight in them. Duo-toned and fire. Schnapps and a pint for $14, sort of the German original boilermaker and his little friend. Most everything was true to form, no kolsch, but I could really taste the marzipan in a few beers. Their west coast style beer is more of a PNW style IPA or an East Coast IPA with extra hops. Being a west coaster it's not merely a DIPA, or something overly hopped. I can tell you an IPA in North County crushed the IBU's of most IPA's in the rest of San Diego and the city is already known for out hopping LA, SB and all the way up the coast, so there is even microcosms of style.  Poutine was solid with a variety of smoked meats, not quite on that Quebec level, I could do without the honey mustard and really just use maple to balance, pretzel and pastrami were also quite good. More salt please. Brewers platter was a little unrefined. Goat Cheese on the chicken club made it sing, I've always known the club was a junk sandwich.  We chose not to get beer because they didn't really have anything togo that was super worthy and who wants to lug tons of beer around all day, we had backpacks, but we would have needed a shopping cart. Prices were on the high side for a brewpub, 3 people racked up $180 tab on beer and food. Service was good, décor was basic converted industrial, but aside from being their brewpub probably doesn't draw that much of a crowd. That wouldn't be here for drinking or eating."}
{"text":"The Distillery District is a nice place to walk around but I find it overrated.  A typical tourist trap where the food is expensive and not always the greatest.  This was the case today at the Mill Street Brew Pub.  It's a bit of a limited menu so our group of four decided to share a bunch of appetizers. We were left underwhelmed.   We had the nachos at $16 that came out cold and were nothing special. How hard is it to make nachos??  There was barely any cheese on them and I think they used a blend of real cheese and processed cheese.  The guacamole was good though.  The giant pretzel also came out barely warm and toughened up pretty quick. We ordered the honey garlic wings and they were pretty good but not crispy as a wing should be. The tater tots were probably the best thing we ordered. They came with a sour cream and a spicy kind of BBQ sauce.  The server was great though and noticed our nachos weren't as we had ordered them and brought us a new order without us having to ask. Although they still weren't the greatest and still barely had any cheese on them. So I don't think we would be in a hurry to go back.  If you are going to the Distillery District, go to the Mexican restaurant ......if you don't mind the wait."}
{"text":"Great brew pub, beware there are two bars in this pub. The regular pub which is off Mill Street and the beer hall which is accessed from Tank House. But go through one and you get to the other. Strangely the beer hall is more fine dining and the pub is just that. Good pub food. The beers on tap are almost the same, but if you won't an ESB you must go in the pub. Again calamari was on the list, we tried it, and it was good, not great, but not bad either. Not over cooked and a nice batter. We shared an artichoke and Stilton dip and a ploughmans platter. Both great, other stuff coming from the kitchen looked just as good. Overall a great time, in a most interesting part of Toronto."}
{"text":"Went to Mill St for my 19th birthday because I love the beer and wanted to try EVERYTHING they had. Luckily they had samplers of 4 6oz beers for only $8, that's 2 pints for the price of one! I tried pretty much everything they had. The Stock Ale, Tankhouse, Coffee Porter and the Cobblestone Stout were by far my favourites. A few others were too fruity or too bitter to really enjoy. Mill St. has an AMAZING selection, basically any kind of beer, lager, pilsner, stout, IPA, etc they had. The food was also really good had the Pulled Pork Sandwich, was unbelievable, service was also very quick."}
{"text":"What a great find.. Big thanks to Sandy who lives in the hood and recommended MSB..  Perfect location for a casual meeting with friends. Food was delicious! I tried their special butternut squash - corn chowder.. Delishhh  The chicken, avocado wrap was AMAZING.. sweet potato fries on the side! YUMMMM  I love this area and MSB is a great place.."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, mediocre food, and poor service. The long wait times and poor seating selection 'seemed' like this was a good eatery. Turns out that the hostesses are just poorly organized. The waitress forgot our order, never checked back, and waited till our food was cold to bring condiments. Moreover, the food was nothing special. Average at best, the omelet has apple in it. The apple was strange and tasted like something had spoiled in the omelet. Wouldn't recommend this venue."}
{"text":"Great new building, beautiful interior and friendly staff.  The food was not good.  We started out with the special of YYC Poutine Week - Donair Poutine.  It would have been great without the \"donair sauce\".  I imagined something similar to tzatziki sauce, but their version was very sweet - sugar is not something that I prefer on my poutine.  We struggled past it trying to maintain our positivity, but when the burger showed up it had a very gamey flavour.  I know that venison is on the menu; however the burger is advertised as BEEF.  I did not taste like beef.  Very good fish & chips - the coleslaw was devoid of any flavour.  This could have been a bad night, like I said, the service is great and the atmosphere was very pleasing.  That being said, I will not return based on the food alone."}
{"text":"Classy and friendly atmosphere. Great assortment of beers and brews. Food is really good. Prices are within reason considering the location."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but the service was horrible. The person who brought out my food dropped my tacos, and my husband's wings landed in my daughter's salad. The guy dropping off the food was nice and apologetic but our server never came to check on us until we were practically done with our food and never realized what had happened when the food was dropped off. We sat with dirty appetizer plates on our table until we asked for the bill. The server was extremely slooooooow and it took forever to get our bill after we asked for it. Go somewhere else. There's way too many other restaurants to choose from than this place that was definitely sub-par."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a Sunday for lunch. I really like the decor! The place is not too loud so it is enjoyable. The beer is really good. I had a bison meat pie. It was good but quite heavy. I couldn't finish it. I'd still recommend that place!"}
{"text":"This place is around the corner from the one with seating outside. It doesn't have outside seating and is much more of a brew pub than a restaurant.  Waited and waited and a line was forming behind us to be seated and finally after 10 min of no host we just sat at the bar.  Flights available, 4-6oz flights for $9.25 that I couldn't pass up.  Ordered jerk chicken sandwich with fries ($16) and it was outstanding! So freaking good!  Hubs had some sliced beef sandwich (don't remember the name because I was focused on my food) and he loved it.  We were so glad we sat at the bar. Service from the young Irish bartender was fantastic! He was so kind and attentive! Worked his ass off running the bar and serving tables and did an excellent job at both. Not sure what the other servers were doing as they weren't working like he was. We did witness the kitchen manager and a smart-ass, loud mouthed, younger Asian waitress fighting right on the floor!  I would definitely go here again without hesitation and would hope the same bartender was working."}
{"text":"I stopped here for an impromptu lunch on a spontaneous trip to the Distillery District. It was past the lunch rush so I was able to easily get a table in the beautiful, sunny patio.  I ordered the flank steak cobb salad. It was a huge dish filled with yummy bacon strips, blue cheese, boiled eggs, cucumbers, tomatoes, avocado, flank teak and spring mixed greens!  The bacon strips were cooked expertly - not undercooked nor burnt.  The steak was medium rare (although, is there a recommended cooking and should the waiter inform you?) and delicious - tender and well seasoned.  I ordered a lager because the recommended pilsner was out of commission for that day.  The server was efficient, friendly and professional.  It was such a lovely, relaxing day, people watching during the Pan Am games."}
{"text":"Changed the menu SLIGHTLY  I think all they did was scale back the menu but one of the things missing is the pulled pork sandwich. It was one of the best things they had! Also the fish and chips have changed. The fish used to be dense and delicious with a slight crust now its mostly batter and super flaky light fish, booo. The fries and sweet potato fries were not crispy at all. What happened guys?  At least the beer is still good so I'll give em that."}
{"text":"Mill Street Brew Pub is a fantastic brewery, pub, and restaurant for a night out. The natural wood fitted, warm toned bar is comforting and is adorned with great vintage brewer ephemera.  Upon entering Mill Street Brew Pub, you are met with their Beer Store on one side, and the entry to the restaurant on the other. The interior design is very open, with natural wood and warm tones on much of the interior. From the dining area, you can see the massive brewery being worked at.   The food was great: fair prices and good portions for your buck. The beer was awesome! My spouse and I had a total of six different beers, to which we thoroughly enjoyed every one for their individual flavour profiles. All of the which was brewed right by Mill Street Brewery - a lovely touch.  The staff was friendly, and they had live music playing (every Thursday starting at 6:00 PM by he way). Being on the Distillery District, the bar holds up high standards that are tough to beat.  All-in-all, whether you're looking for beer or tasty food, Mill Street Brew Pub is surely worth your time!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch while wandering Distillery District.  It was rainy and a bit miserable out, and November - so not a busy time in the area.  No lineups! The interior is beautiful - nicely fits with the whole look/feel of the historic district. Menu had some nice twists on standard fare.  Ordered onion rings, grilled veggie sandwich and club sandwich. Gotta say:  Onion rings were the *best* onion rings I have ever had.  They were melt in your mouth delicious, with just the right dipping sauce.  I could have eaten multiple orders of them, and nothing else, and been very content.  However - we've been eating junk all week, so ... had to move onto other (somewhat) more healthy foods. (Oh, who am I kidding... nothing I ate here was particularly healthy - but I tried.)  Veggie Sandwich came with a salad.  Veggie filling was good - but bread they used was not quite right.  It was good... but...  Hubby was happy with his club.  Fries were good - the slightly over-cooked crispy kind.  (yum)  We each ordered a flight of beer to taste.  I had the big 4.  The Tankhouse and Coffee Porter were the best.  Can't remember what hubby ordered - he liked them all - but liked my Tankhouse the best.  (Coffee Porter was my fave.)  Would I recommend?   Yes.... partly because it's a somewhat reasonably priced option in an over-priced but lovely tourist area, and partly because it's a micro-brewery.  The food is solid, just not great.   Would I return? Yes, I'd go back for onion rings and a brew, no problem.  (But I wouldn't stand in line.)  :-)"}
{"text":"A lot of people don't know it but toronto actually brews some really good beer!  Case in point, Mill Street Brewery. This brewery is tucked away in the distillery district and comes with a full fledged bar, retail store and restaurant. And guess what street it's on?   Mill Street is basically known for it's \"big 4\" beers; the ones sold in the LCBO. These consist of the tankhouse ale, the stock ale, the Belgian wit, and the coffee porter. However, if you go into the actual bar you'll be greeted by a slew of new and seasonal beers that they only have there. These range from your fruit beers to your stouts to your bocks and Oktoberfests. The variety is mezmerizing and delightful. Be sure to wet your whistle with a sample if your not feeling too adventurous. I know I wasn't trying the imperial chocolate stout.  Can't decide?  Try a taster pack. It's basically a couple of the beers in little cups so you can try them all.    I won't go into all the different beers they have because honestly they may not be there the next time I'm back. I'll list my top 3.   First we have the cobblestone stout. I've been around the city trying differen stouts and comparing but coming from drinking guinness all the time nothing really pairs up. The cobblestone stout does though. The beer is nitrogen infused so unless guinness wants to release their nitrogen widget patent you won't be seeing thus out of the bar anytime soon. Upon pourig the stout expect the magical cascading that you usually expect to wait for. The head on the stout afterwards isn't as thick as the guinness head, more like the head on a boddington's. The stout tastes rich with hints of walnuts and chocolate. Definitely my favourite.   Next we have the stock ale. This beer is a lighter beer similar to a sleemens cream ale (kinda). The stock ale is refreshing and crisp with a nice balanced finish. This one's actually sold in the beer store so be sure to try it out. I actually just picked up two kegs for a party. Yes, we really like it.   Narrowing it down to another is kinda hard but i'd have to go with the belgian wit. I'm also a fan of wit beers (wit, wheat, white). The wit is characterized with aromas of corriander and oranges, quite nice on a summer day. I actually was hooked on the wit at luminato one year (mill st is known for sponsoring a slew of events in toronto). The beer is served with a slice of orange to accentuate the flavours in the beer and in my opinion is the best part. After throwing the orange in to soak everthing up it turns into this kinder surprise magical treat at the end of your beer.  This beer is also sold in the beer stores and LCBO. I'd try and pour it out to drink it though cause it's fermented in the bottle and you want to give the bottom a whirl before drinking it.   The bar/restaurant is actually very nice. Large and expansive with a view of the distilling tins. I've been to a bunch of gatherings here and with a call ahead it's great for large parties.   I can't say very much about the food.  I didn't have it this time and don't remember it from the last time I was here. Maybe another day.  PS  Their imperial chocolate stout has chocolate from soma chocolates across the street in it. Delicious.  Heading there now."}
{"text":"Now lacking a back patio, mill st has lost almost anything that's made them special...  The food is typical and bland requiring sauces for palatability. This is now just another tourist hole.  One shining star was the zucchini curry soup."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my wife during the Christmas market in the distillery district Friday afternoon (today).  The market wasn't too interesting, went for lunch and a beer.    I wish I could comment on either the food served or the beer provided but we didn't get any.  After waiting 5 minutes, looking like lost puppies at the entrance for a maitre 'd we were seated and given menus.  That's where the service ended.   We left the table 15 serverless minutes later no less thirsty or hungry.  To say that the service here was bad is both an injustice to the industry and an unfair statement because it was non-existent.   Dear Yelp, please introduce negative stars."}
{"text":"I had just finished a monster 9 day gig at the MTCC, stuck in the bottom of the south building. The American crew wanted to do something different and loved beer so I suggested the Mill Street Brew Pub.  I asked my wife to join us so she met me at the MTCC while the crew went back to their hotels to freshen up. We arrived to a bustling atmosphere and waited at the front door for about 5 minutes before someone acknowledged us. Finally someone showed up and we explained we needed a table for 6 but not right away. Our host explained they were full but tables would be available shortly. We saddled up to the bar and ordered drinks and some Kobe sliders. My wife ordered an Amaretto Sour and I the Organic Lager. My beer was good but the sour was average (sours need fresh juice to make them tasty). The sliders were juicy but very bland for Kobe beef, I would have liked some different sauces to enjoy with them.  My colleagues arrived and we started trying the sample platters and then on to actual pints and they were all pretty good. I enjoyed the fact that the pints were only $6.29 as I can't justify paying more. I especially enjoyed the Fruit beer made with raspberries, what a great summer beer.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dinners and the prices were fair. I had the beer soaked plank salmon which was very tender and the green beans were nice and al dente.   The only thing I would change is the design of the place. It felt a bit like a cafeteria. If there were more banks to break up the chatter it would be a bit more enjoyable.  All in all a good experience, but then again I had just spent 9 days in subterranean AV hell! I'll have to go back during the summer and see, stay tuned....."}
{"text":"Not bad. Service was slow. Lots of families ... Not a huge drink selection (mixed drinks). The chairs are very uncomfortable; metal backs dig into my spine!"}
{"text":"It's become a tourist trap.  Well, the whole Distillery area is a tourist trap at the moment, until more condos get built and residents move in.    The beer is decent.  The decor and furnishings are topnotch.  The servers are very good looking and reasonably friendly.    I think the portion size of their food is a bit on the small side given the expense, but whatever.  Time to go on a diet anyway."}
{"text":"Went during the Christmas Market and had a fun time here. Sat at the bar and had great / timely service. We were able to sample a few different beers before deciding on one and the bartender was spot on with her recommendation - the IPA.  The food was excellent - bratwurst, giant soft pretzel and French fries. The bratwurst was a little dry but still very good and the highlight was the pretzel - it was exactly what you want a soft pretzel to taste like with solid dipping sauces.  Yes it's touristy and loud, but if you know that going in, you'll be fine. Good food / beer in a fun setting in a cool part of Toronto"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time here. Great ambience and decor! The staff were friendly and efficient, and the food was terrific. Now, I was the designated driver,  so I can't comment on the beer, but I will say the shirley temple was great! The Calamari was delicious, nachos were flavourful,  and my beef dip entrée was filling!  The kale Caesar salad was really yummy too! Definitely a must visit place in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Came here on Friday for a birthday. Not sure the location was right for the event, as we weren't there for dinner, just drinks. We were seated at a long table for 16. 8 seats on each side. Hard to socialize with the group. This isn't the venue's problem tho.  I didn't get a chance to eat anything here as we only came for drinks, but I did enjoy the beer. I always enjoy Mill St. beers. I got the 8oz flights, and tried several beers and then for my second round, I had a stein of Organic. The beer is nicely priced.  The only problem is of course is the parking. A little expensive.  I don't know if I'd venture all the way down just to drink, when that could be done at any bar that carries Mill St. beers on tap."}
{"text":"Exceptional! I knew they had an organic lager, but after reading the menu, they have lots of organic stuff and even vegan friendly options! And the food is sustainable. And the sample cups they give tastes in are 100% renewable and 100% biodegradable. Now lets get to the food.  The bar is comfortable and friendly and the bartender gave me multiple samples of things she thought I would like based on my first order. I had a turkey burger which was covered in something that looked like sauerkraut, except it was seasoned with sriracha and was awesome! The house fries were good too. Just the right pair for the burger.  The entire distillery district where the brewery is located is really neat. There are fun shops and things to look at. Mill Street Brewery is a great place for lunch, beer, and dinner."}
{"text":"My husband loves craft beers so of course we had to visit the Mill Street Brewery when we vacationed in Toronto.  Mill Street Brewery has the most impressive atmosphere of any brewpub I've ever been to.  It's part of the refurbished distillery on the east side of downtown Toronto, which has lots of other shops, bars, and restaurants.  The brewery itself has exposed brick walls, copper kettles, and a nice patio in the front and back.  Seating is communal whether you want to sit at a bar or a table.  There is also a few traditional seating and booths in the main space.  My husband thought the beer was \"pretty good,\" which for him is a huge compliment.  (He's very picky when it comes to beer.)  The Beer Hall is the only place in Canada that has bierschnaps, a traditional clear and colorless beer-based spirit that's distilled onsite and served as a shot.  My husband tried this in addition to a few beers on tap and liked it a lot.  I, on the other hand, enjoyed the house-brewed root beer on tap.  Yum!  We stumbled into Mill Street Brewery after we had already eaten dinner so we didn't have an opportunity to try the food.  However, the menu had great options.  If we had more time, we would have come back for lunch!"}
{"text":"First of all, Mill Street Brewery has an awesome venue in an excellent location.  They're one of the first tenants of the Distillery District in an old whisky barrel-aging warehouse that goes back to the heyday of Canadian rum-runners during American Prohibition.  They've done a good job fitting in a nice brewpub in the space and have a nice patio outside (although without heat lamps for some reason!).  The surrounding area has a great mix of galleries, coffee places, and other trendy spots along neat cobblestone lanes.  Ok, now to the beer.  It's pretty good, a solid 4 star effort.  Mill Street no longer brews most of its beers here having gotten much to big for this venue; however, they still do some of their experimental stuff here.  Most of their beers are pretty good; however, I think they may aim at slightly more mass-market tastes and are pretty far behind the Ontario craft beer curve...places like Bellwoods are way ahead now.  I did enjoy the option of having a taster...some of the specialty beers were pretty interesting.  The food...I haven't sampled too many options here.  I found it a solid 3 star effort, nothing to write home about, but much more serviceable than the pubs in my neighborhood in the Village.  3 stars for the food.  The hostess staff....yikes.  Despite having something like 3 staff working the hostess stand/seating desk, they were so incredibly disorganized.  Despite having a massive number of people waiting for tables, tables sat vacant for 30-45 minutes at a time.  We had indicated that we'd take first available inside or out, and finally we thought we had to leave to make a concert.  On our way out, we noticed that only 1 of the 10+ tables on the patio were occupied.  We brought this to their attention and were promptly seated.  Come on ladies, get your act together.  Maybe they need to adjust their walk-in/reservation policy, but it was clearly a mess this night.  2 stars for his part.    Overall, it's not a bad place to visit a couple times if you happen to be taking tourists around the distillery district.  There is a really nice tour that leaves at 3 and 5 PM on the weekend and takes about 20 or 30 minutes.  It's a pretty good description of the brewing process and the history of the area.  Free tastes are offered in the shop...alas they only seem to taste their mass-market beers that are available everywhere.    P.S. Don't bother buying beer here...it's just as expensive as it is at every LCBO or Beer Store in Toronto...supposedly due to Ontario's arcane liquor laws."}
{"text":"I quite like this place. It's located in one of my favourite parts of town (the Distillery District)! I LOVE the nachos here! I have it every time I come! If you do get the nachos, have it with meat sauce, it's great! It can get pretty noisy (especially when a big sports event is on the screens). I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Distillery District is a historic site that many people visit to tour around and enjoy the beautiful buildings/sculptures, as well as to dine at the cafes and restaurants, such as Mill Street Brew Pub. Mill St. offers a wide selection of their refreshing handcrafted beers on tap and a variety of delicious dishes on their menu.  I had visited Distillery District with my mom a few months ago and had lunch at Mill St. For drinks we ordered the Original Organic Lager and Lemon Tea Beer, which is my favourite from Mill St. For the mains, I ordered Stamp Pot which was sausages, asparagus and mashed potatoes, and my mom ordered Fish & Chips. The Stamp Pot was very delicious and the balsamic glaze that was drizzled on top was really tasty with bold flavours. My mom enjoyed the Fish & Chips and said that the haddock was perfectly crispy on the outside and flaky on the inside, just the way she likes it. With delicious food, refreshing drinks and a warm inviting atmosphere, Mill St. is my go-to pub whenever I visit to Distillery District."}
{"text":"Fellow yelper, Linda T., and I decided to head to the Distillery District on Friday since I wanted to go check out a Luminato installation that was occurring there.  We walked around to see what kind of restaurants were available.  I had already gone to Pure Spirits, and I wasn't very happy about the price there.  Being on a new employee/student budget, we decided to go to Mill Street Brewery to check it out.  There was a huge line-up and they told us that we were going to have to wait for at least 30-45 minutes.  We decided sure, why not.  They gave us a beeper so they would contact us if anything.  So we trotted along Distillery to check out the sightings.  I think in less than 30 minutes, we were called to get our seats.  Firstly, our service was AMAZING.  Our waitress was the sweetest girl ever and we had a great time chatting with her.  She was always checking up on us to see if our food was okay, and she had a smile on her face every single time she came by.  The atmosphere was like any other pub/brewery.  We ordered the following: brewer's flatbread to start; I had the beer-drenched cedar plank salmon, Linda T. had a steak (on the World Cup menu for the occassion), and we had the apple crumble ice cream to end.  1) BREWER'S FLATBREAD: topped off with arugala, cherry tomatoes, artichoke, with a bit of goat cheese and balsamic dressing.  We found that the flatbread was not as flat as we hoped so, but it was a good way to start the meal.  2) BEER-DRENCHED CEDAR PLANK SALMON: The salmon wasn't as good as I expected -- I guess I was comparing it to my friend's cedar salmon that he cooked a few weeks ago.  I would've liked it if the salmon wasn't full cooked through - but I guess I should have requested for that.  3) STEAK: I forgot what it was actually called - but this was only offered on the World Cup menu that was available.  Linda T. said it was amazing, so I'm going to trust her word on that ;)  4) APPLE CRUMBLE:  a warm apple crumble with vanilla bean ice cream.  Oh my goodness, you really can't go wrong with that.  The cinammon hit me quite well on this.  In the end though, it was a bit quite sweet - so definitely share this with a friend!  We also ordered a Mill Street Raspberry Ale to share.  Not as good as a Fruli, but it was nice for a girl's night out!"}
{"text":"Ladies and Gentlemen, I present Mill St: A Tragedy in 6 short scenes!  Our table felt like it was on the sun, as only a tiny fan way up in the ceiling provided air.  No A/C? It felt too uncomfortable to eat.  The waitress reacted to questions such as \"are the sides mix & match?\" with preoccupied confusion & a whole lot of awkward attitude.  Our local pal asked why a menu item was missing, and was told the menu was reduced.  It took us forever to decide because the limited options just seemed so unappealing & overpriced.  My meal was super spicy and even though I waited for the waitress to check on us (which didn't happen til the end) I had to get up twice for water from the bar.  The busser didn't ask if I was done, she just threw a napkin on my meal & took it!  Maybe it's because she knows how disappointing the food is, and everyone leaves full plates?  In short, Mill St was the BIGGEST WASTE OF $28 for a meal I have ever had.  Frankly, it was the biggest waste of $28 for anything I ever spent $28 on, in the history of me spending $28."}
{"text":"Okay, I am always a sucker for these brew-pub style places.  Even when they seem to be tourist traps, they just hold such a great place in my heart because they contain awesome foods and plenty of homemade beer.  You really can't go wrong.  The fiance and I walked here from our hotel Downtown on our way to Sound Academy for the Marina and the Diamonds concert.  It was a Monday, so we didn't bother with reservations.  Thankfully, we were quickly seated when we arrived.  It was definitely busy for a Monday night!  We started the evening with the chicken taco appetizer, which I was impressed with.  We both really enjoyed them, and wanted something other than Buffalo wings because, sorry TO, we do wings better in Buffalo that I felt like it would be a horrible jab at my hometown.  Anyway, they were a great sized pre-meal treat!  For entrees, I got the Flat Iron Cobb Salad.  I NEVER get salads, but this really sounded good.  I was very happy with my selection.  My steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, and the house-made stout ranch was such a delicious dressing.  The salad was not over-dressed or under-dressed, and everything was prepared well.  The portion was definitely entree-sized as well.  My fiance got the Shepherd's Lamb & Lager Pie, which seemed to be a really popular item, and we both loved it!  Beers were definitely awesome.  I got the Nightmare on Mill Street Pumpkin beer (I am such a sucker for fall beers) and the Minimus Dubbel.  The Minimus Dubbel was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I was astounded at how good of a Belgian beer this was.  They serve it to you in a little gigantic goblet.  The absolute only downside to the night was the service.  It was spotty, and we got ignored for a bit.  Empty glasses for a while just isn't good service.  Our waiter was busy, but seemed to always glaze over our table.  The appetizer came out fast, but the entrees were on the slow side.  The meal took a bit longer than expected based on service alone, but the food and beer were still spectacular."}
{"text":"Classic pub food reimagined. I got the raspberry wheat beer to start and I've never had a better drink. Got the chicken and chorizo pot pie (excuse my crude caption to the pic) and it was INSANE. Like a classic chicken pot pie your mom would make, but slightly spicy and different. I got the kale caesar on the side, get your greens in! Others in my group got the fish and chips, beef dip, and the spicy green beans, which were to die for. Our waiter was too sweet and friendly, and totally didn't mind chatting with a bunch of tourists. Such a sweet guy!"}
{"text":"went on a saturday, it was busy but not over crowded. Our server was great. I love the build your own beer flights- 4 x 5oz samples for $9. I tried 2 different flights which is exactly one million beers for under $20, and that is a deal!  The down side- very limited menu if you have any form of allergy or dietary restriction. Your Vegan choice is olives and almonds, or carrots and hummus.... Not even a veggie patty for the burger? I mean, you can get a vegan burger at Dennys these days.... Having said that, our server did say they had just opened, and are still working on the menu, and specifically allergy/restriction options. I mean, I get it you don't head out to the pub for a vegetarian/vegan meal usually, but hopefully someone thinks to pop out and buy a box of Bocca burgers at least.   Beyond that, our experience was pretty great. No pressure to order more or turn over the table on a Saturday night, definitely look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"The Mill Street Brewery was a comfortable place to sit on the patio for a beer.    It's also one of the busier places so keep that in mind if you don't want to wait.  Not to worry because they'll give you a pager to let you know when your table is ready so you can wander around The Distillery District.  I didn't get a chance to try the food here, but their Tankhouse Ale and the Mill Street Organic were my favorite beers here."}
{"text":"Having visited the Mill Street at Pearson Airport (Terminal 1) I was stoked to try this place. The internal ambiance is very pub-like, which fits the Distillery District quite well. Having been educated by a waitress at Pearson, most of their dishes have some sort of beer base to them....which makes sense since this place is owned by a brewery......but I'm sure there are options for those who can't consume anything with an alcohol base. The food choices are outstanding....and everything we had was tasty and left you wanting more. I didn't find the place more expensive than restaurants of a similar nature....we're in Toronto after all....and in a happening area. Staff are amazing. Huge shout out to Genevieve...the waitress on our last visit.  Only downside is to finding a parking spot can be difficult, especially during Christmas and sunny days. There's a great City Parking lot on Beverly...try that if all else fails. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Checked out Mill Street Brewery on a whim late one Friday night and it was pretty average. I have been to a Mill street brewery in Toronto so perhaps I was expecting it to be more like that and it wasn't, which unfortunately was a little disappointing.   We arrived around 9:30 and brewery was fairly busy on both the restaurant and the lounge side. We were seated on the restaurant side but ended up moving to the lounge because of the location of our table. We were initially seated at a awkward table of two just in front of the entrance. It felt out of place and in the way. Our waitress, at the time, was amazing and kindly helped us find a table in the lounge.   Once settled, we ordered a couple of drinks and some food. The food was pretty average (wings and turkey meatloaf) and standard for a brewery / pub kind of setting. The lounge side seemed substantially louder than the dining side and it seemed a little small for how many TV's there were. I guess my point is that it was kind of distracting. This might be a good setting for a big group but not ideal for things like a first date or a quiet night out.   Service was kind of hit and miss on the lounge side. It seemed like staff was eager with trying to take our dishes away but lagged in asking for new drinks. Overall, I would visit this place again for a drink or casual hangout but I wouldn't put it on my top go to places."}
{"text":"Meh.  Average cuisine.  Friendly wait staff but the meal took forever and the AC was lacking on an unseasonably warm day.  As usual I don't drink so perhaps a I'm not the best person to review this place.  It was definitely crowded so they must be doing something right"}
{"text":"We only grabbed bar food so I can't comment on that too much, but I can say I went to Toronto in the dead of winter from sunny California - and then ordered nachos.  Which, incidentally, were quite good.  Like most people, the real reason we dropped by Mill Street was the beer.  The Coffee Porter was unique, and tasty.  This isn't Beer Advocate so I won't get all professor beer on you but suffice it to say it was good.  The IPA, to my taste, was not what I expected.  That's probably because I hail from the hop bomb capitol of the world, and if I can taste anything after I finish my first IPA, it's not bitter enough.  The Mill Street IPA is a far milder, old world style IPA, just know that going in.  It's also highly drinkable, refreshing, and crisp.  The Tankhouse Ale was a bit on the watery side, but still good.  I forgot what else we had.  The beer was above average, the snacks good, and the location in the Gooderham and Wort's complex gives it a nice unique atmosphere.  Recommended."}
{"text":"If I could use 0 stars I would. This place was a terrible experience. I went there with my family last weekend. They said they would send a text when table was ready. When we got the text, we got there (like 5 minutes after text was sent) and we patiently waited to be seated.  They never called our name so after 15 minutes we decided to ask. They never found our name and offered us a table for two (we were 3) which was crowded and uncomfortable. We said we would wait for a better table so answer from the manager was: we don't have one, you either take this or go to the end of the list again (waiting time 45 minutes again).  Terrible customer service, terrible attitude from both the person seating people and the manager. One of the most important things in a restaurant is the way they treat clients and obviously this place knows nothing about it. I will never return to this restaurant. It is a shame they can't offer good solutions for problems they create themselves."}
{"text":"Great place - we were in the Distillery area and decided on a light lunch - almost skipped this place based on ratings but glad we went for it as it exceeded our expectations!!  Service was on point - fast, friendly and after I decided to hold off on a drink until I can tried a few sips of my husbands IPA flight- the waiter quickly checked in to see what I had selected so my drink arrived moments after - and on that note it had great drink selections and I really enjoyed the West Coast IPA  We decided on just a few light bites for lunch - kids not so light with a pretzel which was huge but all eaten and tots with an amazing bbq sauce. We tried the kale hummus on toast which was delicious - so flavorful and the Asian style green beans which had a great crunch and the right amount of heat!  Great crowd of people from families to large groups all having fun !! Glad I tried this place !!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, fish and chips on point.  Others in the group had sandwiches that were delish.  The atmosphere was fun and the choice of seating (2 outdoor patios) nice options.  The servers were very pleasant and were great ambassadors for Toronto, offering tips on the city.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Mill Street Brew Pub is one of the few restaurants in Toronto I enjoy. Generally speaking I've not had good food experiences in Toronto. However, Mill Street Brew Pub never disappoints.   Recently I ordered the Montreal Special - Montreal smoked meat served on marbled rye with slaw, honey mustard, and swiss cheese. I'm not familiar with the Montreal style of smoking meat but it tasted very similar to pastrami. Either way, very good and I would order again. My wife took advantage of Monday being Taco Night. She ordered four small tacos - each of which was seasoned beautifully. I didn't have the chance to sneak a bite but she was very happy with her meal. For an appetizer we ordered the Cheddar & Ale Dip. Very good! Dip was fantastic and so were the chips. My only complaint is that there were not enough chips to go with the dip served. This was a bummer because the dip is that good.  As for the beer, very decent considering the styles. I'm not sure what it is with Canada but it seems as though every craft beer is very low ABV. That said, each of the beers I had in my flight had distinct flavors and creative in their own way.  Service was alright, perhaps a little slow, but not to the point where it put a damper on our experience.  Overall, a satisfying experience. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This bar is not bad. We ordered chicken wings and calamari, and they were good.  Service was alright, but I would say the level of detail & attention to patrons could be improved."}
{"text":"I went for dinner here and the service was exceptional. The manager Paul could not have made the night any better. The food was delicious and overall a great night. I highly recommend going for dinner and drinks, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was visiting the historic Distillery District, and chose to come in here for a quick bite. I had the stock ale, which I found to be refreshing and crisp, and the Montreal smoked meat poutine as a quick bite to eat. Now, I never had poutine before; this was my first time eating poutine, and I had to say this was a tasty dish! I am glad I chose to stop in this brewery. Our server was very kind and prompt. I would love to come back here (If I am ever in Toronto again) and actually order a meal."}
{"text":"When I lives close by I would stop in a lot to this place. Service was good, beer is tasty and the food was better than most pub fare. Would go back if I was closer but I wouldn't go out of my way to return either."}
{"text":"The historic building and the district is beautiful! The ambience was great, but I'm a sucker for historically-preserved buildings.  We had a pitcher of the oatmeal stout, which was delicious. For the main course, I had the chicken pot pie (SO GOOD!) & finished off with the apple cobbler.    I Would have given the restaurant 5 stars, but the experience was very long. I understand they are understaffed, so be prepared to spend several minutes waiting for the server."}
{"text":"Visited on a sunday afternoon for drinks and appetizers. Initially we waited forever to be even sat down. The hostess had to call someone to seat us countless times. She got so frustrated she started complaining to us about her coworker. I found this very unprofessional. When we were finally sat it took awhile for a server to come to our table. I ordered the raspberry mixed drink which was pretty good. We started with the calamari which wasn't that great. The three sauces served with it really saved the mushy calamari. Next we ordered the jerk chicken quesadilla which had absolutely zero flavour. Our server even said it was his favourite dish on the menu. So overall, neither the service or food was great. Not sure I'd return."}
{"text":"Very busy during this time of year. The burgers are awesome and the staff was friendly however when another server brought out our food he was confused by what was actually ordered. The food was correct but what he said was not. They have some unique beers on tab and to select from, but was not able to get to enjoy a couple as we were there on our lunch break from work. All in all a nice comfortable place to have a bite to eat."}
{"text":"When we first arrived and were told 45min-1hr I had expected the wait it was a saturday night.  However the girl said here is a pager works the entire distillery so hey we went shopping.  Almost sad when the beeper went off early as I was enjoying the shops.  Beer was great according to my significant other.  The teenagers loved the meal nachos wings and tankburgers. We did not see alot of kids there its seems more adult in concept.  We found the service to be prompt, efficient and courteous.  Portions were large and the we like the fun feel of the place."}
{"text":"This is a nice pub with lots of space right on 17 Ave SW. Music is not too loud so you can have a conversation with the people at your table. They have a good beer variety, I tried the Vanilla Stout and I liked it lots. However, the food is not that good... it is pricey and not as good as expected. I had already had supper so I only ordered fries. An order of fries is $8 dollars... and those were very regular fries... with skin - which didn't make me happy. They have a good food menu but I also find it pricey... I might come back to this place for a beer but I'll make sure I have eaten before coming here"}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times were quite good! The place is a decent size place tucked away in distillery district, which makes it pretty cool. Second time here with the gf we ordered three items off the menu, baked pretzels, canbano(might of spelled it wrong) and brewers platter(I think that's what it's called).  The pretzels were OK, but the sauce holy smokes call in the sauce baussss it was so good omg. The platter I ordered came with chili gouda cheese slices, Italian sausages, salami?, something similar to prosciutto. The sauces were so fun and tasty, I had 4 sauce dips to play with they were fig jam, beer mustard, goat cheese and something I can't remember the name.. (I suck at yelping sorry).   This platter was so fun and unique of putting together your own food together and the different flavors you can create and taste was amazing. This does require you to get your hands dirty and mine were plenty dirty. I had the portage ale and i find it to be very smooth and crisp.  This place can get quite packed depending on what occasion or event is being held in distillery district. So book ahead or you won't get a seat or if you do decide to wait it'll be like hour+ wait times."}
{"text":"I did not eat here, so I base my favorable review solely on the beer, the ambiance and the overall experience.  Make sure you stop in their tasting room before entering the main bar.  Here, you can sample 4 different draft beers for free and get a little explanation from the friendly bartender.  You can also purchase their beer and merchandise.  I enjoyed all the beer that was sampled here.  The pub itself is great.  Busy, lively, bustling with lots of happy people enjoying beer.  I got a flight of 4 different seasonal beers brewed right on site.  They were all great, some more remarkable than others (my favorites: the Cherry IPA and the Vanilla Porter).  Reasonably priced and delivered with friendly and efficient service.  I would definitely return here and sample more beers.  In fact, if I lived in Toronto, I bet I would come here fairly regularly."}
{"text":"2.5 stars  Friendly service, food was okay. Nice looking patio. The crab and shrimp sliders were a nice start, but wished they had more than a speck of meat to go with the lettuce filler.  My husband had the smoked meat poutine which I wasn't a fan of.   I had the spinach salad, which came with the onions I had asked to have excluded, and absolutely doused in salad dressing. It was  a tasty and healthy option after pushing some of the dressing aside."}
{"text":"Visited the Mill St Brewery for the first time on March 10th to show some out-of-town friends around the Distillery area. Showed up quite late - around 11PM and you wouldn't think from being outside that the place would be this packed on a cold night. Boy was it ever packed.  My party arrived in two groups - the initial 5 were told that the wait would be 40 minutes and got comfortable at the bar, only to be picked up for a table in less than 5 minutes ...communication error?? They were happy nonetheless :-) The remaining 3 of us joined them at the table about 10 minutes later.  The server we had was quite good, and seemed to be ready on hand as soon as drinks were getting finished.   Around the table, most of the guys had the Tankhouse Ale, and a light Ale. My out-of-towners who favor the likes of Bud and Miller beer said they found the beers to be \"sour\"? I thought all beers are sour so not sure what that meant. Anyway, I was pumped to try their Fruity Beer, but they were out of it (very disappointed in this!) , and had to settle for a Green Apple Smirnoff which was delicious!  Foodwise, heard the Butter Chicken was GREAT (bowl licked clean good), and so was their house burger. The chicken-pot-pie got less rave reviews.   All in all, the atmosphere was great, on the loud side, but that's what a pub should be, the pricing was affordable (pints for $6.40) and it was warm and cozy in there. We stayed till 2AM, although the thought of losing 1hr with DST meant it was 3AM- sucks! Overall, a great night, Ill try and return over summer."}
{"text":"First of all, amazing beer! I'm a huge fan of micro-brews so this was a perfect match for me! I also enjoyed the food very much. I've tried a few items on the menu, so did my family on different occasions. It was always very good and I never had anything to complain about. The staff is not the friendliest, but I've been served much worse elsewhere. I'm absolutely going back!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there is a Mill Street Brew Pub, and a Mill Street Beer Hall, or why they have 2 separate addresses but are the same building...but I digress.  We were checking out the Distillery District on a rainy day, so we spent a good chunk of time at Mill Street.  We didn't order any food, but we did each order a beer sampler.  It was 4 or 5 beer samples for $9.  The sample sizes were generous too.  I was curious about their \"organic\" beer, so I gave that one a shot.  I didn't really like it.  There wasn't much flavor to it.  My favorites were the Frambozen (very similar to Framboise) and the Lemon Tea, both nice and easy to drink summer brews.  I'm always a happy camper when I order a beer sampler and each one stands out with a distinctive flavor.  It's frustrating getting buzzed off of some samples, wanting to order a beer, and having no clue what you liked versus what you didn't.  That didn't happen for either of us at Mill Street.  Most of the patrons, surprisingly, were large families.  The atmosphere was less \"brewery\" and more \"family restaurant,\" like a TGI Fridays just a tad classier.  There is seating indoors and a very nice looking patio, which was vacated during the rain.  If I were go to back here, I'd want to sit at the patio or bar.  Five stars for the great beer and good service."}
{"text":"Nice big bar, all their products on draft and food looked good.  At 5 pm last saturday there was a 2 hour wait for tables!  Crowds not their fault, but yikes.  Lotsa big TV's around bar."}
{"text":"Mill st organic is fantastic beer.   The bar area has great nibbles and we went on a Tuesday evening when they offer wings for .55 ea and they are super.  Had honey and garlic 10 wings for two of us along with a shandy.  Super fun place, interesting and charming location in the old distillery district.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Mill Street Brewery, I would sort of classify them as the Sam Adams of Ontario - they're readily available in LCBOs and Beer Stores, and often if a restaurant has a microbrew on tap, they'll often have a Mill Street selection.  So we were in town on Saturday after going to a Jays game, and decided to head over to the Distillery District and give them a try. The whole Distillery District is great, something I definitely want to visit again, and we soon rolled up to their front door. It was pretty busy, and there was a bit of a line to talk to the host. At first, we were a bit worried we would have a long wait, and we discussed what our max wait time would be. All that was dropped after the host let us know it would be 20 minutes. No problem for us. They have a nice reservation system where they give you a page when your table is ready. So we went off to do a little exploring, and almost immediately had to turn around, our table came up in about 5 minutes.  We were quickly taken in and seated at a small table, and this is the one place where our experience was less than awesome. It was right near the server station, in a high traffic area. There wasn't a great place to hang my purse up, the hook that was nearby would have caused my purse to hit Lee in the face, so I hung it on the side of my chair .. where it started to be constantly bumped by unapologetic servers as they quickly went by. Lee scooted his chair back and we tried pushing the table back a bit so I was more out of traffic, but to no avail. I finally just moved my purse over to his side.  Other than that little bump (ha) the service was great. Our server was very knowledgeable about the beers, and made recommendations. Since we were at the mothership, I tried their attempt at a California Common style beer (think Anchor Steam) called July Talk. It was a great beer, very good for the style.  So, they have a poutine on their menu. And those who read or follow my reviews know, I cannot resist a poutine. I really enjoy seeing how chefs put a spin on this seemingly simple dish. In this case it is a Montreal Smoked Meat poutine. Lee was a little bit dubious at having mustard on it, but it was excellent. The smoked meat was a little bit too fine in parts, which made it difficult to get all the shreds, but we both really enjoyed it, and I highly recommend it.  For entrees, I had the butter chicken, and Lee had the steak frites. Lee stuck with July Talk for beer, and I switched to Stargazer to get something more bitter to go with the butter chicken. Both entrees were good, the butter chicken wasn't too spicy, and Lee enjoyed his steak.  By this time we were both too stuffed to enjoy a dessert, so we skipped that.  So, all in all, this is a great place to have a beer, particularly if you're a fan of Mill Street. They have a tasting room where you can go in and try their beers, you can also pick up growlers there, and some limited edition brews. If you go on a Saturday, be prepared for a busy time, but overall this is a place I would definitely head back to."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on what was a very busy morning during the christmas market.  Eggs were very undercooked for 3 of us.  Basically inedible. Didn't really eat much of the breakfast but we didn't really complain until the bill came.  We only received a \"sorry\".  Can;'t expect much from a tourist trap resto.    I know it was busy but c'mon - you can't even cook eggs?"}
{"text":"The Mill Street Brew Pub is in a great location, but there can be a wait at times.  When I last went I was able to walk right in, and sit right down (at either a high or low table.)    The waitstaff was attentive and courteous.  A flat of 4 8oz beers runs you $12.00 which isn't bad, and allows you to try 4 different flavours.  What they have on tap is constantly changing, and often times not available in the LCBO, so there's your incentive.  A sandwich is about $16.00 - so it's not the cheapest, but it's far from the most expensive place you'll visit."}
{"text":"A growing and comfortable place in the distillery.   Really happy to see their brewery expanding but their food/service can sometimes be suspect.   I have had it explained a few times as missing staff or staff that were sent home only to later find out that they suddenly are understaffed.   Mill Street is now doing cans and has expanded their beer selection. Perhaps that is the focus.   Still, reasonably priced for the hood."}
{"text":"The Toronto Steampunk Society descended on the Mill Street Pub at 10:30 am on a Saturday and it was deserted. Within fifteen minutes it was packed. Get there early.   The brunch menu is somewhat limited -- a few variations on eggs benedict, an omelet, a big breakfast platter, and some French toast.  If you can't eat eggs, not to worry, because the lunch menu is also open during brunch. Everyone in our party, including some with various allergies, found things to eat.   All the food looked excellent. The poached eggs were a bit overdone in the yolks (although I didn't specify) but otherwise everything was really tasty. I regretted not ordering the banana-and-Nutella stuffed French toast after I saw other people eating it. Coffee is decent and fortunately bottomless. Yes, there were people in the pub ordering alcohol with brunch, from traditional mimosas and Caesars to flights of Mill Street beer samplers.   Once it gets crowded, things move slowly. The wait staff seem to be rushing around like decapitated chickens, getting food to tables but after that neglecting the customers somewhat. They don't look at you long enough for you to flag them down if you need them.   The slow service was the one big downer, as we did have someplace to be after brunch. If you want anything other than a lazy, leisurely dining experience, get there right at 10:30 when they open, and you'll probably get out by noon. Otherwise everything was great -- the place is spacious, wood-and-steel, with accessible facilities, and we never had trouble hearing each other talk even once it got crowded.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I will admit in general I am not a fan of the distillery district; parking can be horrible and the prices can be ridiculously high for what your getting, However I was pleasantly suprised by the Mill St Brewery.  Although the place was packed and there was a line we did not wait long and were promptly seated on the patio as requested by a friendly host. Our server was just as amiable and had a fair bit of knowledge of the menu and draft list. I realize many bars offer a large selection but pointing to a chalk board after a customer asks whats on tap isn't as efficient as it is lazy.   I am personally a huge fan of the Mill st Organic beer and my friend loves dark, stout beer so she ordered cobblestone stout her favorite dark beer. The service was friendly and fast, we got our apps very quickly and although I was not a fan of the crab cakes I did really like the calamari and chicken wings. This was just a quick stop for a bite and a beer with a friend so I did not order an Entree and so cannot comment on that aspect.  The front patio is not that large but I do believe they have a larger back area however because the sun was now setting and shining directly into our eyes we decided to finish up our beers inside. Indoors is a rather unique scenerio with the brewery and retail store set up just inside. Even with all that crammed in the area is still rather large with clean amenities and a large bar streching the length of the room.  The bill was reflective of the area we were in and as I say the Distillary district is always a little pricey but in this case it was worth it.. Overall I would say this was a nice experience and I will likely be revisiting at some point in the future"}
{"text":"This is a cool looking restaurant with an equally cool location. The food is standard Pub Fair with nothing specular about it. The place was jammed to capacity & we waited about 20 mins for a table. The wings were on for 1/2 price & I know why...musta been from mini chickens...they were TINY!! I also had an Angus burger which was just good not great."}
{"text":"A lean turkey burger, a side of spinach strawberry salad and a clean Mill Street Organic makes for a refreshing pub meal that doesn't leave me feeling gross.  I went here for a work event and the service was quick and friendly.  I've also been on the brewery tour on another visit and thought that was interesting too.  I recommend the flight of beers if you're looking to try the different interesting flavours.  This would make a great date place since it's laid-back and there are always interesting things to look at in the Distillery District shops."}
{"text":"I love Distillery District and I remember liking the Mill Street Beer Hall but was pretty disappointed with this visit.   Came to watch the Jays game Friday night. Got seated at a great table and our table weren't huge drinkers, maybe 1 drink each and we felt non existent to our server. Barely checked up on us and replenished our waters, left our empty glasses on the table. I get that tables who order drinks brings the money to the business but it doesn't mean we should be non-existent. Waited forever for the bills as well. We wanted to order more food but because the server was nowhere to be found we just didn't feel like waiting anymore after that. Disappointing visit for sure and probably won't be back. Pretzel was good and shareable. Would skip the tater tots. Wings were super dry. I gave this a 2 because I liked the atmosphere but service and food was not good."}
{"text":"Restaurant/Brewery located in the Distillery District.   They have food and beer, similar to BJ's back home.  4 Beer Flight - $8.95 - Pretty pricey for a flight. Decent beer but I did not love any of them. They do not have all the beer listed in the menu."}
{"text":"Went here for a flight tasting and to chill.  The atmosphere was ok and the place had two distinct restaurants: the indoor and outdoor space.  I thought the beers were nothing that special, but it is a great place to relax."}
{"text":"Meh.  Though this place has some very nice decor and feel, the beer doesn't seem that impressive.  There's definitely a lot of seating inside for groups - outdoor patio doesn't look as appealing though.   In terms of beer selection, I had the coffee  porter which was recommended to me. Not bad, unique beer with a strange coffee finish.   Also tried the tankhouse - definitely screams of an abundance of hops in it's beer.   Will go here again to try it's famed 'wit' beer."}
{"text":"Our waiter and service was great. He tried his best despite all the delays in the kitchen. Took almost an hour to get food. Food was just ok and way overpriced. $12 for kids menu? This pub has really gone done hill since last time I was here a year ago."}
{"text":"When I first saw Mill Street Brewery there was a line to get in. I almost skipped it, I personally hate waiting in line for restaurants, and I was a little concerned since I just had some not so great beer at Granite a few hours before. But I'm glad I got in line... it only took about 10 minutes to get in and there were plenty of tables I just think they were busier then they usually were. The place is really big with a huge outdoor patio area. Once we sat down the waiter came to our table right away... we were not given a beer list so my finacée just asked for the sampler and I ordered a Tankhouse Ale since that was the first thing I saw. Once he walked away we grabbed a beer list off the table next to us and quickly saw we could have ordered some other really good sounding beers. Once he came back with the beers we were still looking over the menu for what to get to eat... looking back now I wish we would have ordered right then because he didn't come back to the table for awhile.   Before I get into the food let me just say that the Tankhosue Ale is tasty stuff, like Luke A said it's solid. The sampler my finacée ordered had \"the big four\", Tankhouse, The Organic, Belgium, and the Coffee porter. The Tankhosue was the best but the Coffee Porter was also very good.  Finally we were able to place our order for a couple appetizers (Crab Cakes & Brie Quesadillas). Both of these were excellent.  While we were there I also tried a sampler of the ESB, which was ok and the IPA which was very good. Mill Street is a good place in my book, I liked the beer and food and the environment although busy was pretty nice."}
{"text":"Really nice pub in Distillery district with perfect patio for the summer days. The beers are good and there are a lot of seasonal choices on tap. You can get a flight of four and enjoy the tasting. Service is very nice and timely. Besides that the food is pretty good. I may have an obsession with the kale caesar salad, but it is really delicious.  During the last visit my friend had the fish in chips, which was yum. There is a tasting room besides the pub, where you can have a little taste of the remaining beers, surprisingly we even found one, which was not on the pub menu so it is strongly recommended to check the tasting room before or after. There you can also find some of the seasonal beers bottled or canned. Of course the standard beers of Mill Street are available in every store, but may be this is the best way to figure out your preferred brew."}
{"text":"3.5 stars...  Food was not good but the service made up for it..  Ordered a Prime Rib Steak, came with mashed potatoes, green beans, Yorkshire pudding, and a nice big piece of Prime Rib - $30  Food came pretty fast and also allowed me to order it a bit before 4pm..   The meat quality of the prime rib was poor.. nothing close to a chef's cut and probably a AA rating.. so it didn't have flavour and was chewy.. the Yorkshire pudding was also chewy.. very very chewy..  We sat at the bar and ordered a couple pints of beer and my friend had a veggie burger.. bartender came by and asked how was the food, i replied so-so and she insisted asking me how so.. told her the prime-rib over cooked and the Yorkshire pudding was chewy.. she said she would take care of it..  When I asked for the bill - the bill came and the prime-rib wasn't listed, I asked and she said she took it off cause I didn't like it.  I would expect this service at a steakhouse, but really didn't expect it here!! Wow!!!  Probably would have left a 2 star rating, if she didn't the bartender didn't turn things around."}
{"text":"My wife and I were on vacation in Toronto and took a walk down to the Distillery District and went to one of the 5 or 6 brew pubs in Toronto. Pretty mild brews, but the couple I had were pretty good. They did have something I have never seen before, distilled beer. What a cool idea, it was pretty good, they ran out of the one I wanted, so I got the last of the batch and a free one for my trouble.  I ordered the Montreal smoked meat sandwich with a salad on the side. Amazing! The greasiness was perfect for  the flavorful brisket like meat with a salad on the side. So yummy.  The service was super great and overall it was a fantastic dinner! Mmm....Smoked Montreal meat. The best!"}
{"text":"I'm a tourist from NY. Want to comment on a few areas of why this place deserve a 4.5 star. 1. While I was here it was raining but I insisted on the option of staying outside. They accommodated nicely and the waitress was superb. 2. The food was decent and the beer was good. I recommend the tasting or the ginger. 3. The rain got so hard that I had to finish quickly and take shelter, they are willing to accommodate people in their lobby.  Bottom line service was awesome, people are hands on and chill vibe. Pricing is average."}
{"text":"This is the best vegan / vegetarian place in the distillery district.   They have a quinoa wrap, a veggie burger, sweet potato fries, and salads. The food is high quality.   There are more than a dozen beers on tap.   Prices are reasonable and the outdoor seating is great."}
{"text":"After Gord and I saw \"The Odd Couple\" this afternoon, we had supper at the Mill St. Brewpub, about a block from the theatre. It's been a while since we've been there.  It was a gorgeous afternoon (sunny and 24C) so we sat on the patio ... the patio and the restaurant ended up being packed and there was a line-up.  Gord started with the fish and shrimp cakes ... he said they were good (I'm not a fan of fish cakes).  Then he had the Chicken Schnitzel from their Oktoberfest menu which he said was good too.  I had the buttered chicken which was delicious.  Our waiter, Gio, was attentive when we got there before it got busy."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, garbage food.  Dry over cooked fish and chips (sent back first order) and two over cooked bland flavorless burgers.   17 bucks for a burger the waitress described as \"messy\" (that's why I ordered it) and it was anything but.  Had I dropped the thing it would have chipped the pavement.    Go for drinks, never for food."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Toronto for work, I end up here to unwind after a long day and night of, well, working.  Maybe I am just a creature of habit, but there's more to it than just mindlessly defaulting to what I know. Mill Street has won over my heart for a few reasons (listed in order from least important to most important):  1. The food is good enough. Actually, the weekend breakfast (I refuse to say the 'unch word') is quite amazing. I've had a burger, which was good; fish & chips, which were very good; and the wings, which were just short of excellent, especially for Canada. 2. The beer is fantastic. They're really doing amazing things with their brewing. A top notch IPA and even beer styles that I typically don't care for are done so well that I can't help but love them - see Organic Lager. Also, watching the stout settle is one of the most beautiful and relaxing things I have seen in my entire life.  3. The staff is just absolutely lovely. While I only make it up to Toronto once every few months, I am often greeted with a jovial and booming Irish, 'Mr. Riley, how have you been?' by the ever friendly Eamonn. Being treated like a regular at a place you visit infrequently just warms your soul. Marianna is also a joy behind the bar. I don't know the names of some of the other bartenders, but they've all been amazing. The last time I was there, the petite blond girl, who I had seen working but never had as an actual bartender was amazingly nice to us all night long and I feel bad that I can't call her out by name for her excellent service. Similarly, there is a guy who works days (taller and bald) who has always treated me amazingly when I've been there early and I wish I could give him his props. He's one of the most attentive bartenders I've ever had."}
{"text":"Really wanted to love the brew pub but sorry to say it didn't impress me much. I've been twice when visiting Toronto, and while there was good service on a sunny patio but the menu and rink menu had nothing that would urge me to hurry back. Really the location and the organic brew would be the only reason to return. Standard gastropub if you are looking for a place for a large party or chill afternoon, this might be the spot."}
{"text":"Came here after seeing a long line up across at El Carnita. Terrible idea. Got the Angus burger described as \"dressed to the nines\" on the menu. You'd think a simple burger would be standard at a pub, but no. \"Dressed to the nines\" here meant a burger with ONLY tomato, lettuce and mayo. That was it. No onions, no pickles, no ketchup, no mustard, no relish, literally only three ingredients besides the bun and meat patty. It was like a huge joke for whoever ordered it. Dressed to the nines? Yeah right.  Never again. Fries were nothing to write home about either, came out cold. Please avoid at all costs!  Service took a long time as well."}
{"text":"Amazing food to start and really good beer. The organic lager original is almost like bumble gum sweet and the brown is a nice color and taste. The fun due is perfect to share with your table. I had the salmon salad, deliscious and great presentation, tryed the kale salad really good too and shared the chicken and waffles with the table. The chicken and waffles is amazing and a great plate to share with three people."}
{"text":"Ok if you think of this place as a restaurant, it's not amazing.   But if you think of this place as a pub, it's a good one.  It's similar to the beer bistro because they have beer as an ingredient on many of their menu items. But the selection of beer is strictly mill street - and it's pretty good beer. Plus they have special beers for the season. Nice.   Most menu items are decently priced, some feel not worth it. But all in all, it's pub food, with a one notch higher rating. Mondays is a good happy hour day.   Also, it's nice that they have a tasting room right at the entrance and of course, the distillery district itself."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend for her birthday, very casual and friendly place, prices are normal, not expensive. I had the curry chicken and it was great. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"good burger and thank you teri to be our server today we will be back  again"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on a Friday and grabbed food at the bar. Great service from the bartender. Lively location that appears to be a hot spot. We didn't have to wait long for seating at the bar but it was packed waiting for a table.  I tried the fruity wheat beer and it was pretty tasty.  We shared some appetizers including poutine and nachos with a cobb salad. Everything was delicious but huge portions! There were three of us and we did not get more than half way through each plate."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is awesome but unfortunately  that doesn't feel up ur stomach.  The fries were good but my steak sandwich was okay at best.  The dipping sauce that come with it was very salty.  Not worth $20 for the sandwich.  Not anything to write home about"}
{"text":"Great craft beer. I like the panorama, vanilla porter and coffee stout. Food is delicious as well. Friendly staff. Clean bathrooms. Make sure to make time for their brewery tour!"}
{"text":"I love Mill Street Brew Pub for not being overpriced (just like other bars in the vicinity), friendly staff, good food and of course beer ;-)........Love to visit again"}
{"text":"Tastes like Gordon Bierch."}
{"text":"This is a decent pub; they have good food specials and a great beer selection. The Distillery District is a nice area. I have one major grouch though. I ordered some wings that were on special (50c each, but you had to order a minimum of ten). Since I was by myself, I could only get through half of them, but when I asked to get the rest to go, they refused!  I asked what the logic of this was, and the server said \"Um, something to do with they don't want people ordering too many and then not eating them\" or something.  Okay, what? How does this is any way make any sense at all? First of all, let me just point out the completely bloody obvious: this policy does not save the Mill St Brewery any money. In fact, it probably does the opposite, since once someone has had this experience, they're likely to order less next time. Second obvious point: the customer was always going to pay for those wings anyway. It's not like we're going to demand a refund for our uneaten portion of wings. They've got their money, so why should they care if we take it home and have a delicious midnight snack? Why are they so desperate to throw away perfectly good food?  I'll tell you why. They surely must be reheating the wings and serving them again. It's the only possible reason why they would insist on not letting you take them home.  Either they are throwing out a hell of a lot of uneaten wings--which if true, is also immensely irresponsible when we have a global food crisis and people are starving to death in Somalia--OR they are serving them up again to the next sap. Why else? If you've got a better explanation for this ridiculous policy, I'd love to hear it...  Finally: if you're not going to let people take home the food that they are paying for, you should inform them of that BEFORE THEY ORDER. I'm paying for it, so it's my food. if I want to take it home instead of see it thrown in the garbage, I should be allowed to."}
{"text":"This pub is ready great. The waitress gave us free craft beer samples, thought the service is kinda slow. We had beer flight, Montreal smoke bacon Poutine, artisan bread and beef salad. All is great. Price is also surprising."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The food is pretty good and the service is good. Yesterday I tried their burger with a salad.  The burger was tasty but I felt the side salad was a bit skimpy."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, the food tasted great and was good quality (if a little overpriced), and the beer selection was outstanding.  Service was erratic, but they were really busy during the lunch service.  Fish and chips and the butter chicken dishes were both very good. I would like to return and try other items."}
{"text":"Just get the spinach dip with the pretzel bread. That's all you need to know.  Best customer service. At times the place is packed and they forget your order or mess it up, they will pay for your meal or give you a free app. This has happened at least 3 times for me but I don't even care that they messed up my order! Free food? Yea why not.  The fish and chips are good. The short rib poutine is decent.   Very busy in the evenings and weekends. Be prepared for a wait list."}
{"text":"They infuse many menu items with beer.  Poutine is tasty.   Arugula salad with the added salmon was ok. Nothing stellar but better than salads at other pubs. Quite expensive at $21. I'd want a $21 salad to taste amazing but this one didn't.   Service was friendly.  They have daily specials. Probably a better idea to go here if you can catch one of those. Paying full price seems like a rip off. Also, stick to pub food. The salad was a disappointment."}
{"text":"As if it's not bad enough that my beloved back patio is currently closed for renovations, these \"renovations\" are actually going to cut the previously magnificent space in half. Bummer!  Don't get me wrong though, the high ceilinged and spacious indoor dining area provisioned with booths and tables of all sizes as well as the shady front sidewalk patio are still more than good enough and provide plentiful seating on any given day. Mill Street's IPA is still my favourite in-house draft and there are many trusty pub fare options on the food menu to choose from. The service is consistently friendly and there is really nothing to complain about (as long as you don't miss the old back patio as much as I do)."}
{"text":"Yay, yet another new brewery in Calgary, which is quickly becoming home to some of the best beer in Canada!  Full Disclaimer: We came here tonight as part of a YELP ELITE meetup but paid our own way. Mill Street has several pubs in eastern Canada but this is their first foray into the wild west. They had more than a dozen beers on offer, many with whimsical winter/skiing themed names. All the beers except one are still brewed in the east. But they had one local red beer on draft that is a collaboration between Mill Street and Trolley 5 brewery located a few blocks away. Our friendly waitress told us more local beers will be brewed on site in the coming weeks. For food, we had a few apps; wife had the salt & pepper chicken wings which I personally was not too keen (too bready). But I had the divine wild boar meatballs that were phenomenal, and I tried another Yelpers venison reuben which was AWESOME and will definitely order next time I'm here.  All in all, a good first impression and looking forward to coming back and filling up my growlers."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick drink on my way home from work. The bar was mostly empty but reasonably pleasant. They have Mill Street beers on tap (4 different types) for 6.25 a pint. They also have a food menu that I didn't try. I found the space kind of dark and the music a little too loud. Also, the server was a bit grumpy and several tables were dirty when I arrived and weren't cleaned by the time I left. I get the feeling that this place is usually quiet so definitely a good option for a group if you can't get in anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Located within the distillery district this brew pub was packed for a Thursday night due to the Christmas market. I tried the Whit (wheat beer) and it was really good  with mild flavors. The building that houses this place is really neat with exposed brick and a nice large bar. Did not try the food but it looked good. Lack of star due to slow service from the bartender."}
{"text":"I love this place. Any time someone comes to visit Toronto I take them here.  The beer is great, I've tried them all many times. The bierschnapps is a little odd, tastes like tequila with hint of hops.  Try the paddle if it's your first time. You'll get 4 different beers and it's a pretty good deal.  Food here is awesome, I've never had a bad meal here. Flat bread pizza's are awesome.    I like to sit outside when it's warm. They have a great covered seating area with couches.  We took the tour which was pretty abbreviated but as a bit of a beer nut I still enjoyed hearing the story of the brewery and seeing brewing space. For $10 you get free samples before the tour, a paddle after the tour, and a sample of the bierschnapps. Not a bad deal.   Go here! It's great and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My friends and I sat and ate on the front patio. Nothing unique about the front patio to be honest, but we were seated immediately outside since of the zero wait time for the front patio. Although, the seating inside had a waiting time but we chose to sit at the front patio initially. The host was very kind, funny, and friendly and was able to direct me to their washroom.   My friends and I took advantage of the Tuesday Special, Half-Price Wings (with a purchase of a beverage). My friends and I shared our wings (Honey Garlic, Mild, and Medium) and they all tasted like average wings, nothing unique. Along with the chicken wings, I ordered Calamari and Sweet Potato Fries. The calamari tasted average too, even with the three sauces provided. The Sweet Potato Fries were salty probably because of the sea/coarse salt that was added which you can visibly see and shake off.   Overall, Mill Street Brew Pub offers typical and average pub food. Although, the location and decor is very unique. Also, service is amazing."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Thursday evening around 5 and checked in with the hostess outside. There was a bit of a wait for 2 of us so we asked if there were seats open at the bar. She acted like she had never been inside and had no clue if it was busy or not and that question was too much for her to handle. My bf walked in and signaled for me to come in and see that the bar was wide open. Why was it so hard for her to be like, \"Oh, it's wide open\"?   Anyway. We sat at the bar and were helped immediately. It was cask night so I asked the bartender if she knew what the cask would be and she didn't know. That was strange. Anyway, I ordered a ESB and it was very good. It was refreshing and had the typical notes of a ESB. She also poured us a sample of a Blueberry Wheat and it was not good at all. It tasted like a cross between cough syrup and a Hefeweizen and as I type that it doesn't sound good. We ordered food and it was ok. The spinach dip was missing something, but the calamari was pretty tasty.  3.5"}
{"text":"Three out of five is really 60% if we look at it mathematically.  That's exactly what I'd give Mill Street.  Simply put, the food is lackluster.  I've been here many times though rarely is it my first, second, or even third choice.  I just think for the money, you can have a much better meal at a lot of other places.  Today, heading home on the Lakeshore, we passed by the Distillery.  Because it's convenient, we stopped here for lunch.  I had the lobster grill cheese.  I've never knowingly had canned lobster before, but what was on my sandwich seemed like the lobster equivalent of canned tuna; it was mushy, flavorless, and generic.  The sandwich was supposed to have brie in it, but I failed to see or taste any.  And the bread was so dry it ripped up the inside of my mouth.  The coleslaw that accompanied the sandwich tasted like it had just been dumped out of one of those bags of salad you can pick up at the grocery store if you're too lazy to wash and prep lettuce.  Simply put, there was no love in this meal.  I'm not much for sharing details of stomach upset, so let's just say this meal was operating on borrowed time and leave it at that.  The only reason this place isn't a 2/5 is at least the servers are pleasant and it doesn't take an eternity to \"enjoy\" a meal.  The best things to say about today's lunch are at least this place is across the lane from SOMA and you can pick up some Mill Street beer which is good."}
{"text":"To my first trip to Canada my friends and I decided to go to Mill Street.  The brewery/restaurant is located in the renovated \"distillery district\" so the location is great.    The food is good,  short rib Poutine was excellent and the Lobster grilled cheese really hit my taste buds well when paired with the beer sampler.  The beer I'd recommend trying the lemon tea beer as it's not something you can get everywhere.  I'm from Chicago where we have access to a lot of world class brews and this is not even there (sadly we don't have anything close).    In closing when I go back to Toronto again I will go to Mill Street and only remember to bring more back across the border with me."}
{"text":"Overall it's a great place to relax for a beer with friends.  They have a bunch of sampler packs if you can't decide what flavour, and they also have detailed descriptions on everything so you know what you're in for.  The patios (yes, more than one) are huge and at both the front & back.  The prices were reasonable (considering its in the distillery district).  Also the appetizers were good as well and was a decent sized portion (we got the calamari)."}
{"text":"Your typical bar food. It was nice to be in their actually brewery.  They let us sample their seasonal special brews.  We ordered Jamaican jerk sandwich, nachos (+ guac) & poutine.  Nothing special.  The added guac for $2 was not worth it, they just have you a dollop of it in those plastic sauce cups.  It was a nice spacious bar though, in a good district."}
{"text":"We had the short rib poutine and it was delicious.   Service was just OK.  We enjoy drinking local beers so we enjoyed trying their brew.   If you go here, it is more about walking around the distillery district than the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"I had a really pleasant experience visiting Mill St. Brew Pub. Not only that they have all my favourite selections of beers, the servers really know how to deal with situation and make their customers satisfied. First of all, the beers. As all my friends know about me, I love Mill Street Brewer's beer. I always, always consider Mill Street's beers as my first choices in all available bars and restaurants (esp. the Mill St Original Organic). Of course, they did not let me down in this visit. I had a pint of Cobblestone Stout and my date had a pint of ESB - both of the selections were really tasty. Interestingly, although the ESB was bitter, the hoppiness of the beer did not overpower the flavors of the other elements in the beer (malt & a hint of chocolate). As for my Cobblestone Stout, it was creamy, smooth and pleasant. The finishes with the hints of chocolate, walnut and malt were nicely presented.  Honestly, I would have given Mill Street Brew Pub 3 stars already because of the beers. The service, on the other hand, made me rate them a 4 stars restaurant. After the drinks, I ordered 2 tacos on top of the beer. However, the preparation of the tacos was about 20-25 mins delayed for some reasons (which I didn't even mind that much). After the arrival of the tacos, the servers, Blair and Ashley came to us and apologized. Blair stated that the delay was not up their service standard, and paid our meals with extra two $10 discount cards.  To conclude, Mill Street Brew Pub had shown me what a great customer service is. I will come visit again with friends really soon."}
{"text":"Giant brewery and pub. Decent service, great patio, good pub food. I had a veggie burger with fries and a wit beer and I was mot disappointed, but I could probably get a similar meal elsewhere at a slightly lower price. For fans of Mill Street Brewing company it is a lovely location with the chance to try out a new brew or take home your favorite."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food and ambiance here.  The service is a little slow at times but nothing that would take away from the overall experience.  I would recommend getting the wings here although other things on the menu that I have tried are also quite awesome.  Above par food compared to a regular pub and a more comfortable atmosphere.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Went there on Oct 26, 2017 and had a great time with good food and great beer.  The service was good and I'd highly recommended it!"}
{"text":"This place needs work. We had stopped in for a drink on a beautifully sunny day. Unfortunately the problems began the moment we sat down. The outdoor bar was dirty and smelled like filthy bleach water. The wait staff uniforms were shockingly filthy with dirt (like are they ever washed??) We were tended to by the bartenders only once over the course of an hour. Their table cleaning cloth and wash was grossly located directly next to the clean utensils and cups (of which it splashed and splattered on the clean dishes every time someone went to use the cloth) Overall we left with a dirty feeling and were grateful we didn't stay for a meal."}
{"text":"Be sure to try the poutine and fondue. We ate outside and enjoyed the vibe and brews."}
{"text":"Awesome vibe, solid beer, and sub-par food.   On a nice summer night, the outside patio is perfect. An atmosphere that is both romantic and light. Plus you can stare at all the hipsters that walk by. Unfortunately, the wait for the patio can get very long. So alas we had to sit inside. Still the inside was really cool with all its Victorian-style architecture.  To start off, we had two beer flights, which are samplers. In total, we tried 8 types of beers. Half of them were forgettable and I can't seem to remember their names. The one common theme was that they were all light-even the stout and the IPA.  My personal favorite was the lemon tea.  For food, we started with the butter chicken poutine, which was my favorite dish. Come to think of it, I wish we had ordered three servings of this instead of ordering the angus burger and Montreal special. The angus burger tasted like a basic backyard burger while the Montreal special, an ordinary Reuben, wasn't anything special. Fortunately, the spicy mustard that I ordered made these more palatable. It's kind of sad but the best part of my sandwich was actually the kale salad.    Overall, the service was friendly and the atmosphere was nice. Just don't come here expecting to be blown away by amazing food."}
{"text":"Certainly not my first choice for dining in the Distrillery District.  I was interested in patio dining, but everywhere was already filled with a long wait.  We were able to get a table here in the bar.  Not the best table, very noisy and we were in the middle of a high traffic area.  Our server was thoughtful enough to move us to a table along the wall when one opened up.  I had the Bang Bang Shrimp soft tacos.  The shrimp were jalapeno breaded, tossed in aioli and topped with my favorite, cilantro, salsa and avacado.  These puppies were SO good!  I really loved my meal here!"}
{"text":"Great craft beer as this is a local brewery. Try one of the seasonal drafts,  always something interesting on tap. This place also has a great patio out back...  Lunch and dinner food is okay pub stuff,  but brunch is great especially when they have live Jazz outdoors."}
{"text":"Visited this place with a friend for the first time while strolling around Distillery District during noon. I got the fish taco while my friend chose the vegetarian burger. The fish taco was delicious! It was only $12 I believe too. Reasonably priced. The fish was quite small though, but good enough."}
{"text":"Beer was good, they gave you samples in the gift shop while you wait. The food however was terrible. We ordered the BBQ ribs, and they were so salty they burned  in my mouth. Plus the ribs were burnt themselves. My friends ordered burgers, and they were overcooked too. The fries were soggy.  Agree with everyone that says come for the beer, get food somewhere else."}
{"text":"The Distillery District is a historic area of Toronto with cobbled streets, designer boutiques, art galleries and restaurants. It's a really cool area to have a wander and if you're feeling hungry or thirsty I recommend stopping at Mill St. Brewery.   It's a big venue with an outdoor patio- perfect on a summer's day. I sat down outside and ordered one of their craft beers, which the server helped me choose. There are burgers etc on the menu but I wanted something light and healthy, so he suggested his personal favourite was the quinoa salad. It was really good and I haven't had a quinoa salad as good as that since!   Good spot for lunch and has a great atmosphere with it being quite a large, busy venue."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm really disappointed in this brew pub.  When I lived in Toronto for 5 years Mill Street was my go-to craft brewer with Amsterdam in a close second. Tankhouse was my trusty beer to replace Big Rock's Traditional Ale which, at the time, was hard to find in YYZ. Mill Street was even the location of my going away party when I moved back to YYC: https://www.yelp.ca/biz/mill-street-beer-hall-toronto?hrid=lVicS-UdmYVGY9t0LSlCtg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)  When rumours started flying a couple years about them opening a location in Calgary I was excited. Then just before the official announcement in 2015 they also announced that they were being acquired by Labatt (InBev). Sad days.  The location is great. It's on 17th Ave, but outside of the core of the Red Mile. We went after the Roughnecks game on a Friday night to find the place busy, but not crazy. We were able to find a table easily. I would imagine a different story after a Flames game.  Our service was great. The ladies at the front greeted us and showed us to a few table options. Our server was right on top of things all night. What ruined the service factor for me was the end of the night. My bill came to just over $31 for my two flights and wife's glass of wine. I gave the server $40 and she said she'd be back with change. She never came back. I've worked as a bartender and I normally tip well, but wasn't going to leave a $9 tip.  The only food our table ordered was fries. They were good and came with an aioli and ketchup. No complaints.  The ultimate disappointment for me was, obviously, the beer. I had two flights during my visit so that I could try a bunch of new stuff and sip on some old favourites.   My first flight was completely new to me options: Costigan Kolsch (2.5) Schleimhammer Roggenbier (3.25) Twin Tips Double IPA (2.25) Diggers Dunkel (3.0)  My second flight was some new ones and old fav's: Lemon Tea Beer (4.0) Mountain Bock (3.5) West Coast Style IPA (2.0) Tankhouse Ale (4.5)  Those numbers in brackets are my Untapped ratings. The beers made at the local brewpub all received mediocre to poor ratings from my palate. The West Coast IPA was the biggest downer for me. The bitterness that you would expect from an IPA came from the fruit (a bad thing) not from the hops (a good thing). The double IPA was really weak for a DIPA. There was no bite or dryness. Their Kolsch leaves something to be desired for me. The rest were just ok."}
{"text":"Really cool decorations and the beer is quite tasty. My personal favorites are the organic lager and the 100th meridian. Our bartender was really friendly and helpful and the whole vibe of the place is very welcoming."}
{"text":"Great food with great beer.  Had the TankHouse Lane Burger. Made to order.  Good selection of food from their menu and a great place to enjoy a nice local beer.  Very busy on weekends. Leave your name at the pub and start shopping around the Distillery District.   Their restaurant pagers work  in the entire area of the Distillery."}
{"text":"Fantastic lobster mac & cheese. Great patio and lovely area. Perfect place for a date."}
{"text":"I had a really good bison meatloaf with great mashed potatoes. I also had an awesome seasonal vanilla porter! This is located in the really cool distillery district."}
{"text":"My review will be based on Mill Street Brewery's Weekend Brunch experience, which I found it is A-OK!   We arrived around 12:30 pm on a Sunday afternoon during Toronto Christmas Market event as I expected there is going to be a long wait! To my surprise, we were seated right away! I am glad that the restaurant has anticipate the booming business and layout more tables and have extra staffs.   Our waiter is nice and friendly. Took our order and our food arrived in 10 minutes!! I was expecting with a full house, it will take a lot longer to be served.   Egg Charlotte ($9) and Mill Street Omelet ($9) are both A-OK, especially for the prices they are charging and the location (hey I am in a touristy area)... But I suspected that they are precooked and sitting under heated lamp waiting for my order.   It is so warm and toasty inside as they have the heat on maximum... the waitresses all wearing short skirts and I see the need for that! :P   I will for sure want to come back and try some of their beers and ales on tap!"}
{"text":"I love Mill Street beer so I had that as a given going in, but the chicken wings were also delicious. The server was kind, fast, and funny. The bar is pretty sweet too. Great atmosphere. My only knock on this place is that I wasn't there long enough to drink everything on the menu. Guess I'll be back."}
{"text":"We thought is was strange that our waitress never asked how we wanted our burgers cooked. Not wanting to be annoying, we just went with it. But one burger was almost burnt to a crisp and the other was ver, very well done. The buns were dry, cole slaw and mashed potatoes were tasteless, cheap amount of fries. My wife said the ketchup was the best part of her plate.   Service was mediocre, they all seemed to not give a $%$#, im sure this resembles the attitude of the mgmt. Took them 5 minutes to find us napkins, condiments, etc.... AFTER our food was served.   totaly overpriced!   But great locations is the only good thing i can say. Otherwise, they didnt seem to care about delivering a quality and tastful meal."}
{"text":"Great place to come for a beer and some pub fare. I came with a friend and his family and I ordered chicken pot pie, which was definitely what I was craving after a long rainy weekend. Service was prompt but not attentive, and at times it was hard to find the server. She was very nice though and made a thoughtful beer recommendation based on our mutual likes.   The chicken pot pie btw was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Spectacular food and beer! Cozy environment! Not so cheap but worth to try it! Perfect place to go after work to have fun with friends!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, service was bad waited at least 10-15 minutes before anyone even came to take a drink order. We ordered drinks and food right away and food took forever. The beer is good and cold. Good root beer. We had beef dip was good. Had burger it was good. I think it tasted better cause we were so hungry after the wait."}
{"text":"Writing this review after two visits to Mill St.    To be honest, my first trip didn't go well.  We were seated and then got ignored for a very long time.  We literally got lost in the hustle/bustle of a busy day I guess.  It was long enough that we left, when we told the lady at the door we were never served or even approached she kind of laughed it off.   This was definitely not the response we anticipated.   I don't like to leave a bad review without first contacting the establishment and letting them know what happened.  This is what I did.  The manager we talked to was amazing. She instantly mailed us some gift cards, and said next time we were in the area to give her a call and she would make sure we were taken care of.  We called her on a Friday night and even though they don't do reso's on Friday night - she saved us a table during a super busy time.   This past experience was great!  We got the nachos as well as the spinach dip app.  Both were above average, and the spinach dip was some of the best I have ever had.    Our server was beyond great.  He was super helpful and unbelievably knowledgeable about the beer selection.  He even brought us a couple samples to test.  When it was time to order, all 4 people at our table ordered a \"flight\" (4 8oz beers).  Our server took our order without writing it down, and came back with all 4 flights (16 different types of beers) without making a mistake.   I dropped one star because of the first issue we had but was blown away by how they made up for it.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here after the jays game , Great beer selection, good prompt service. Didn't order food but everything looked good !"}
{"text":"Walked in while visiting Toronto for business. Got the pancetta poutine fries which I could eat over and over again...wow! And got the beer flight, all were good and made in house! Double wow! Overall impressed with the food, service and atmosphere. Would recommend to others visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"Alright food.  Great atmosphere. The service was the worst part for me.   My coleslaw came clearly without dressing, and I kindly asked the server for a side of it, and he told me I was wrong, that there was dressing on it. My girlfriends Coleslaw had dressing on it, I tasted it to compair, and mine absolutely did not. I don't know why he wanted to challenge me on this? Is the 3 cents of dressing that worth it to them? Or does he just enjoy arguing?   Either way, unacceptable. I would go back if I had a different server."}
{"text":"My buddies and I came here for a Brewery Tour and moved over to the bar area for food afterwards. I wish I could give it 4.5 stars, but alas I rounded down to 4.   In regards to the tour: This was the best part of the Brewery. Hands down 5 stars. We had Lucas give us the tour and he was very nice and extremely knowledgeable on both beer, history and this particular brewery itself. He answered all of our questions, gave us detailed history of the particular area of Toronto going back a couple hundred years, and let us try several beers (and the root beer which was also really good) during the tasting portion.  Food: This is where things were a bit mediocre and where it felt like 3 stars. The prices were expensive, 21 dollars for a burger (elk), and it was cooked well done as well.  Beer: Very extensive beer menu. We had tried several at the bar. The one I ordered was good, but unfortunately members of my group weren't very satisfied with there's. Like I said the beer menu is huge, can almost be overwhelming, so just try and pick something safe (don't get the cherry milkshake!).  Ambience: This brings the score back up again. Very open feel, love the old warehouse vibes with the brick walls. TVs with sports games on and they had a large shuffleboard table which was great to play on while drinking and watching the game.   Service: Brewery tour service was top notch. It was fine for the dining experience. I would definitely recommend this place. Will probably come back just for the beers."}
{"text":"Fab meal. I got the beef dip. It was delicious. Our waiter was so helpful & amazing. Pot pie incredible. Fish & chip awesome."}
{"text":"Trying to find a soft pretzel in Toronto is like trying to track down the world's lost Imperial Fabergé eggs - a nearly impossible task. There is exactly ONE German restaurant in all of Toronto and they don't serve soft pretzels. What's a salty, knotted dough lovin' gal to do?  Imagine my surprise when I saw soft pretzels on the menu at Mill Street! I literally gasped. Two big, buttered up and salty pretzels cost $5 and come with beer-infused aioli and also marinara sauce for dipping. The pretzels arrive hotter than the corona of the sun so try not to arrive TOO hungry or you'll surely scald yourself.  I also ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio ($7.50) in a rocks glass, and when our Aussie server delivered it he also brought a straw (??). I thought he was mocking my choice of vessel but he said some people have actual phobias of their lips touching a thin-lipped glass, or any glass at all, so he thought the straw might be a nice touch. Thoughtful, but unusual!"}
{"text":"The food menu at Mill Street Brew Pub primarily features a variety of sandwiches, burgers, and other pub foods. I tried the Montreal Smoked Meat Poutine and the Montreal Special. The Poutine included smoked meat, cheese curds, gravy, pickles, and honey mustard. The pickles added a nice sour touch and the rest of the toppings had an enjoyable but pretty standard flavor. The Montreal Special was basically a smoked meat sandwich. The sandwich was forgettable with average flavor and chewy meat. The beer menu had a nice selection of Mill Street beers and every beer I tried was delicious. The brew pub also has an attached shop where you can sample four Mill Street beers for free and purchase bottles and other merchandise. Overall, I recommend visiting Mill Street Brew Pub strictly for the beer."}
{"text":"I love the distillery district - especially during the Christmas Market - and love beer.  Naturally I'm going to be pretty happy here.  Mill Street has some great beers.  I am a big fan of their Organic which is everywhere but they have a lot of special beers on offer here you can't find elsewhere.  At the top of the list for me is their Vanilla Porter.  Amazing.    The food is good but not spectacular.  The apps are fairly solid and they have them on for half-price on Mondays. In the summer it can be hard to find seating but they do have a great outdoor patio."}
{"text":"We had burgers, fries and a beer at this pub on Sunday night! Note you have to pay $5 to visit the Distillery!   The burgers were dry and over cooked and the fries were soggy! This awful food cost me $120 including tip ( wasn't the waitress's fault ) the beer was ok but over priced!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Lunch service is better than dinner service. Portions are inconsistent. 3 people at table ordered fish and chips and serving sizes varied on each plate at the same table, same time."}
{"text":"Great environment, large selection of beer, being the choice phobia, take me too long to decide. Food was so so."}
{"text":"The beer was great, as to be expected but the food was a huge let down. We ordered the \"Fun-due\" and the cheese sauce was just awful. It tasted burnt and it was grainy. Not what that's supposed to be. Everyone else at their table wasn't super impressed with their meal either, the primavera was bland and the perogies dry. I will give them another chance as they were incredibly busy last night but for a famous pub their food tastes sub standard. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"After the trip to the CN Tower, our group head downtown Ontario to check out the distillery district. Originally, we asked for table at Pure Spirits but the wait on a Friday evening was nearly impossible.   We came across Mill Street Brewery and ask for a table for 10. Ther's also seating in the outdoor patio for groups of 4. We got seated immediately, and the waiter was superb! He was fantastic and gave us the different hints and brew of beer. I asked about a beer that had fermented apple juice known as hard cider in Canada. Other than Corona, I'm not much of a beer drinker so this was perfect for me. It was delish! Since the rest of the fam are Canadians, they ordered their local favs. I also had the White Sangria which for some reason tasted more like beer than wine.   We ordered the Spicy Thai Mussels that was big enough for our whole party to share. I had the Grilled Flatiron Steak Sandwich (marinated steak with Coffee Porter BBQ Sauce topped with caramelized onions, melted Swiss Cheese, and a zesty horseradish cream cheese spread on artisan bread). My husband had the Chicken & Shrimp Linguine with asparagus, roasted sweet peppers, and sun dried tomatoes tossed in a fresh, basil pesto sauce. The rest of our party had a variety of dishes ranging from the Strawberry Spinach Salad to Prime-Rib Steak (listed on a separate menu). The food was really good. Great Portions as well.    On my way to the washroom (Canadian Lingo: Bathrooms/Restrooms are known as washrooms), I saw an enclosed glass room that held the breweries where all the beers are freshly brewed and crafted on site. I would def come back on my next visit to Ontario! For an old-fashioned historic brewery with a touch of a rustic feel, this place stays true to its name."}
{"text":"They lose all points for not showing any Jays or TFC games on their TVs. At Union station, adjacent to MLSE headquarters and the Air Canada Center. Walking distance from the Skydome. No games on the tube. If I wanted to watch CP24 while waiting for the train I could go to any bank or entertainment district bathroom. Fail."}
{"text":"Took my friends visiting from the UK to the distillery. As they come from Europe, they are huge beer fans. We discovered the tasting bar at the Mill Street Brew Pub. The young girl helping us at the tasting bar was so knowledgable about all the products and beer. She told us after that she has only been working there for 3 weeks! We were so surprised as she was so passionate when talking about beer and so willing to learn. It was great that we were able to taste 3 beers each for free. After the tasting, we did have a beer at the pub for the full experience. They also offer flights of beer for a reasonable price.   I would totally recommend friends from out of town for this experience."}
{"text":"Food and service is always amazing. They have a great patio in the summer and the experience in the winter around distillery makes this location a must stop for anyone looking to have great beer and great food."}
{"text":"I have zero complaints. The food was delicious. Our servers, both at our table and at the bar, were attentive and delightful. They had a nice menu and even nicer drinks. Good luck staying for less that a couple drinks. We sat inside for dinner and outside for drinks and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. Never have had a bad meal. Service is fast and friendly. Have often had a burger, which has always been juicy and tasteful. They do a great strawberry spinach salad, which is worth the small extra to have as a side.  The steak sandwich is probably the best I've had.  It does get very busy, so worth making a reservation."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved this place!!! I loved everything about it once I walked in the door. The atmosphere of the pub was great with its industrial feel and vintage decor. Although i'm not typically a beer drinker and usually have a hard time finding a beer I like, I started with a flight of beers which helped me decide on the Organic beer.  That said, I really did like them all!  Since I've heard that the poutine was a must try pub app in Canada, I was super stoked to see it on the menu and not disappointed. For my meal I had the Cuban sandwich with the spinach strawberry salad.  The Cuban was good but the salad was delicious, I highly recommend it. If you find yourself in Toronto looking for a good vibe, good food, and great beer this is the place."}
{"text":"Sat outside and ordered a flight.  Their summer seasonal selection was fantastic!! I stopped in the bottle shop to bring some goods home!!!"}
{"text":"If you don't think the distillery district is a little magical, you're probably too cynical for my tastes. Every time I come to this ye olden pocket of the city, I am reminded of all that is special in Toronto. It's not just for tourists, so if you haven't been in a while pop on down, it's poppin' even after the Christmas market closes.   Mill Street is deservingly King of the distillery, with their great brewery, beer shop and two restaurants. I'm a huge fan of the Beer Hall, but for a casual sip the Brew Pub is an solid choice.   My friend had their vanilla porter, and really enjoyed it. I wasn't in a beer mood, so I went for a bloody with extra horseradish. Bloody good. We also shared some big soft pretzels with heavenly dips. All in all, a great pub experience."}
{"text":"The Distillery District is one of my favorite areas to visit. I often stop in at the Mill St. brewery for cold beverage some something to eat.  I do agree with Luke's review - its slightly fancied-up pub grub, that is OK. Its the beer that brings me back. The beer tasting platter is a fun way to try out the different beers they serve."}
{"text":"Came here to escape the cold while browsing the shops in the Distillery district. We were just coming off of a trip to St. Lawrence market, so we weren't particularly hungry, so we each got a flight of beers, and split the recommended smoked meat poutine (Thanks, Amy W!). The place has an Irish pub feel to it, complete with waitresses decked out in plaid skirts and knee-high socks. The beer selection is pretty expansive, which is why we opted for the flights of beer, my favorites being their signature tankhouse ale and the Meridian amber lager. Both were tasty in their own ways, but what I remember most is how well-balanced they were. Not too hoppy, not too sweet, and both had very easy finishes.  The smoked meat poutine was excellent, and the shredded pickles were key in keeping the overall richness of the dish from being overpowering. The meat was tender, and the hand-cut fries were very crispy, and somehow kept their texture, despite being covered in cheese and gravy. I can see why it was highly recommended. Definitely a great pairing with all the beer we had.  However, the service was very spotty throughout the meal. Not to mention, while the place was pretty large, some of the tables did seem kinda cramped together, for no particular reason. Neighboring parties kept bumping into us, despite the clearly large space. A little curious. Prices were very reasonable, with the flight 4 6oz beers only being about $9. Given that low price, it's incredibly dangerous, because you can just spend all day trying all the different beers they have.  Seems like a solid spot for lots of beer and pub food, and maybe catch some sports on the TV if you're in the area, if you can deal with the crowds and the less-than-ideal service. To be fair it's a little bit on the touristy side, but even so, I can see the entire experience being a little more enjoyable during warmer weather. May have to come back on my next trip to Toronto, if the weather is more suitable for outdoor drinking."}
{"text":"I'd give the food and service three stars, but the beer four! I probably would have rated Mill Street a four if I'd been able to sit outside, but the rest of our party was in a bit of a hurry, so inside with no wait it was.   It may have been because our waitress forgot to put in our ticket, but it took at least 45 minutes just to get our charcuterie board with at least 4 or 5 different people coming up to our table to check on us. As a bit of a nibbles snob, I found the selection on the board a little meh, but it went well with the beer. The chicken club was, again, okay. Nothing to write home about. The fish & chips was easily the best thing we ordered.  As for the beer, we ordered a pitcher of the 100th Meridian (LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!) and another of one of their seasonal options, which was very refreshing.   I love the distillery district, so I'm sure I'll be eventually, but will make it a point to sit outside next time!"}
{"text":"We went early afternoon mid-week. There were 2 other tables. First the waitress took a long time getting asking for the drink order to the point where we ordered lunch at the same time. When entering our order in the computer, she reaxhed up and leaned over so I got a view of her backside due to her short skirt. After the food was brought, she never got us refills and only came to clear out table. Obviously we were ready to leave, so we waited for the check. 5-10 minutes later she asked if we were ready for the check, disappeared for a while and finally brought the check. Unfortunately the time we had to spend in the distillery area was spent as we waited a lot for the waitress and we had to leave without seeing the rest of the area. Not a place for a quick lunch.  The fondue was the perfect lunch as we had a light breakfast already and weren't very hungry. The homemade rootbeer was delicious; I wish they bottled it so I could have taken some home!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Mill St.! The service was very kind and welcoming, and it was not the most attentive service, but I do not feel that really worsened my stay there. I ordered the Steak Frites, which was one of the pricier items on the menu, and it was absolutely excellent. Drinks were not ridiculously priced either. I would definitely dine here again!"}
{"text":"We made a quick beer stop here after taking a walk around the distillery district.  I really love this area, old factories and buildings, cobblestone.  The area has a really cool vibe.  Mill St. has a nice little brew pub setup, complete with a patio.  I love many of Mill Streets beers including their Lemon Tea, Organic and Coffee Porter.   I had the porter during my visit and it was much tastier there than back West.  We didn't have any food, and just a quick beer, but it was a nice stop on our Toronto beer tour :)"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto this past weekend with my sister. Before going my colleagues familiar with the city said \"go to the Distillery District!!!\" With such a resoundingly positive endorsement how could I not check it out? On Saturday night we were looking for something for dinner and decided to try Mill Street Brew Pub. There were two different seating areas, one a long outside bar overlooking the brew kettles, and the other an outdoor patio and indoor restaurant section. We opted for the place with the shortest wait which was the outdoor patio. Interestingly enough the two areas shared a host stand but featured different menu options. Saturday night was pretty blustery and cool too so when we sat down we were glad we had sweaters on. Apparently only one other table of patrons opted to sit outside and brave the chill.   The waitress arrived promptly and took our drinks order. One Original Organic Lager and one Belgiun Wit. The beers were very reasonably priced, especially for craft beer. At $6 CAD these were practically a steal! In Chicago where I live craft beer costs as must as $8 or $9 USD depending on where you go. Before our beers arrived the waitress brought samples of their saison to try. Don't mind if I do...  The menu was a bit on the shorter side but had plenty of your traditional pub fair. In our Uber to the Distillery District our Uber driver Chris told us to try the wings. He said they are very underrated. So that's what we did...an order of wings with the sauces on the side, mild and honey garlic because we couldn't agree on just one. We also ordered the Penne a La Bierschnaps which was pasta with prosciutto, grana padano, basil, and a tomato creme sauce. When the wings arrived we were pleasantly surprised. It was good we got the sauces on the side because we were able to appreciate how good the wings really were. The breading was crispy and delicious and the sauces added a ton of flavor. As for the pasta, it was pretty standard pasta. It was good but nothing special and my favorite part was probably the bread if I'm completely honest. Who doesn't love carbs? The wings were definitely the highlight of the meal and if I could do it all over I'd definitely get them again. The beers were great too and I'd definitely have them again, especially at those prices!!  Overall this is a solid little spot for a meal. I bet the patio area is packed on a sunny summer afternoon with tons of people milling about. The staff were friendly, attentive, and on their game. The food was good, the atmosphere cool and fun, and the beer cold. Can't go wrong. Will return."}
