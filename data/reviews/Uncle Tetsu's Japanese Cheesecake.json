{"text":"Great Japanese Cheesecake!! I loved it!! 

The only thing they need to figure out is an effective way to get that line moving faster. It can be a very long wait ... Which makes the  whole experience negative for people.... Taking away from the enjoyment of the products."}
{"text":"I had to see what the fuss was about.  The line was just over an hour long on a sunny Saturday afternoon. I hung out with a friend so at least the time passed quickly. You can smell the goodness coming from the ovens from outside. 

One batch of cheesecakes yields 12 orders.  Probably about 35-40 mins to bake, but they gave a couple of ovens so the line moves every 20 mins or so. 

I got a cheesecake and an order of Madeleine's. Both were really good! The cheese cake was melt in your mouth soft and not too sweet as its American counterpart. My friend who does not like American cheesecake thoroughly enjoyed this variation. 

Would I stand in line again for over an hour for this? Not likely. But I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again if there wasn't a line."}
{"text":"I was walking by and there was Two people in line.   So i drop in a bough a cheese cake. Feels like a tourist 
Trap and I won't ever go back to (unless i am forced to )  andwait in line more than five minutes.



It tasted a liitle better than a metro brand grocery store cake  but not work the line up or the hype.   If you want the real deal go junior in Brooklyn in  nyc  .



I had this on three different ocassional and the same way all three times"}

The product is tasty but definitely not worth more than a10 minute wait."}

I can see how it might be to some people's tastes but neither my husband nor I enjoyed it much. Staff was enthusiastic and friendly, though!"}

I was strolling through Downtown Toronto during the last week of August when I realized Uncle Tetsu's Matcha cafe had opened up not too long ago. My hubby and I had heard about their very popular cheesecake cafe, but every time I had time to visit, the line was too long for my schedule. Luckily, on a late Saturday afternoon, I was able to squeeze in some time to visit their Matcha cafe (their cheesecake cafe line up was still far too long!).

The first thing I did when I got to their cafe was line up. I wasn't sure of what I wanted to order, but I made sure I lined up before I had a chance to make up my mind. The line up was relatively shorter (it seemed like) when I got there, but it quickly got longer with no sign of stopping.

Their menu was on the side of their main door which made it easier to choose while waiting. I didn't know they also had madeleines as I had only heard about their matcha cheesecake and green tea soft serve. I was tempted to try them (those buy x get y free things always get me!) but I decided to save my calories for dinner and resisted.

One of their workers were working so diligently making the next batter of cheesecakes and madeleines. As their cafe had a wide open window, it was very easy to see inside and most people who were lined up were also looking at how these matcha goodies were made. I felt a little bad for the worker though - it didn't seem like there was any AC inside.

We learned later that we didn't need to wait in line for just green tea soft serve. What seemed like the owner regularly checked the long line up outside to see if any of the customers were only wishing to purchase matcha soft serve. As the soft serve was able to be served immediately (no need to wait for the cheesecakes to bake!) you don't need to wait in line - just go up to the counter and ask for the soft serve.

A guy in front of me wanted to purchase the madeleines with red bean in them, only to find that they were already sold out of them! Or at least, they weren't available when he ordered as they weren't ready yet. I'm not sure which is the right reason...but he sure seemed disappointed. The plain madeleines were much more abundant (as you can see in the picture) in stock. If you want to try the ones with red bean though, I suggest you visit the cafe as quick as they open before they sell out!

My husband didn't have very high expectations for the soft serve. \"How good can it be?\" he asked, and after one bite, his question was answered \"as good as it can get\". It truly was a very flavourful and delicious matcha soft serve. The dessert was very light in texture (compared to other soft serves) but very full of flavour which we both much loved. The green tea flavour was sweet and bitter at the same time and it was very addicting. If I lived in Toronto, I probably would've come here for this very matcha soft serve on a regular basis. It is a definite recommend and overall much preferred over the popular cheesecake.

As for the cheesecake, my hubby and I were quite lucky because a big batch of the matcha cheesecakes had just come out of the oven just before we ordered one. We were able to grab one without any more wait! I haven't had that much luck in a long time. Since we had plans for the rest of the night, we only got to try the cheesecake later on when we got home. Our verdict about the cheesecake is this: It is worth trying if you love cheesecake, but it's not worth waiting in line for if you like your cheesecake dense.

Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake is very peculiar; it is definitely not the type of cheesecake most Westerners are used to. It is not dense nor big in size...definitely not your \"New York Cheesecake\" style. I had tried a version of the Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake back in Korea years ago in a local department store, and this tasted exactly like what I had back then, except it had green tea flavours in it. The cheesecake is very fluffy in texture - in between a mousse and cake - and the cheese flavour isn't overly strong as you would expect with the North American version. Many Asian cultures aren't used to eating a lot of cheese in their diet, let alone dessert, so this light and fluffy cheesecake may suit those that don't prefer the strong cheese tastes. I think many people may like the matcha green tea cheesecake more than the original (since you can't really get green tea cheesecake in many places), and I recommend you to try the green tea version first if you're unsure of how you are going to like the original. Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake is definitely not bad, or not worth waiting for, as many have said, but just purely different. I hope the green tea flavour may be a good transition for you to try this Japanese style of cheesecake!

Me? I'd definitely repurchase it, be it the original or the matcha; I just don't want to wait in line forever. I will be back when the popularity dies down though!"}
{"text":"I first heard about Uncle Tetsu's from my sister, she let me know that the first location that opened in Toronto had line-ups out the door on a daily basis, so I knew it had to be good. I actually got my first slice of Japanese cheesecake from the stand out in the little farmer's market area in front of union station. I walked by, saw that there was no line and jumped in! I just got a slice to start off, but ended up walking away with an entire cake to share with my Husband. It's moist and not over-poweringly sweet. A new favourite for sure!"}
{"text":"I love dessert and therefore had to try this cheesecake that was worth a 2 hour wait for so many people. 

We had the 6 inch cheesecake and some madeleines. Everything was fresh out of the oven. The cheesecake is the fluffiest cake I've ever had - it's more like a light sponge cake with a hint of cheesecake flavour. It's fluffy when freshly baked (we tried it 25 minutes after we bought it when we got home and it was still warm). After a day in the fridge it becomes a little denser but still not as dense as a regular cheesecake.

The madeleines are the size of cupcakes and are delicious and extremely buttery. They are only good the day of.

Cheesecakes are $8.88 and madeleines are $2.22 each but there was a deal to buy 3 and get the 4th free. 

I still prefer north american cheesecake (for example, Carole's cheesecake in yorkville) but I'm glad i tried it. I felt like something was missing from the cake - like roasted almonds or another flavour but that may be because I prefer the traditional cheesecake. I would wait for the hype to die down before going back."}
{"text":"I tried the cheesecake a few months ago, and was lucky that the line wasn't too long. I like that the cheesecake is freshly made and is not excessively sweet. A tip: put it in the fridge and try it once it's cooled; much firmer cake and the flavours meld together."}
{"text":"I've been to both the regular Uncle tetsu and the matcha cafe.  The regular cheesecake is good.  Be sure to refrigerate it before eating because the taste is a lot nicer. It tastes pretty bland at room temperature. Today I decided to try the matcha cafe. I bought the matcha cheesecake, the matcha madeleine with red bean,  and the matcha soft serve. 
When I took the matcha cheesecake out of the box to see it, It was extremely cracked and broken, and I could see the insides were still wet. It was VERY undercooked and I can't believe they actually packaged it and gave it to me! Luckily I was still in the shop so I asked for another one.  The girl working in front apologized and gave me another cake quickly. I checked it again and it looked okay.  The shape of the cake was definitely not as round and raised as the original one,  but I let that pass.  Fast forward to when I got home. I let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours and then took it out to cut and eat. The cake fell apart while I was cutting it, unlike the clean cut with the original cake. The taste was pretty good, it has a Japanese  cheesecake taste with a punch of matcha, but the texture was off. It was still a bit too wet and slightly undercooked. I think the batch that they made today was just taken out of the oven too fast.  Or maybe the matcha flavour is known to be more wet... Someone please offer some insight here. 

My review on the matcha red bean madeleine : it was great!  Texture was on point and the red bean really compliments the taste of matcha! 

The matcha soft serve: I expected it to be more on the creamy side... It seemed more like a sorbet to me. The taste was eh. It's too water based for me. 

From my experience, the original uncle tetsu seems more consistent with their cakes.  I really want to give the matcha cheesecake another shot, just because I've heard that people like the matcha cheesecake more than the original. Maybe today was just bad luck."}
{"text":"I've attempted the line-up at their Dundas store several times but often gave up (typically line ups are 1 - 2 hr long unless you go super early) so I was very excited to try their cheesecake for the first time at their Union station pop up location. The cheesecake itself was very good - light, not too sweet, true to the Japanese style. It's not cheap and it's not mind-blowing but a decent occasional treat. Final verdict: decent product, but definitely not worth the wait"}
{"text":"Definitely not worth waiting in line for two hours. I get that it's a different style of cheesecake than what we're used to in North America but I was pretty disappointed. It's like a bland slightly sweet souffle. We also had the madeleines, which were grainy in a cornbread sort of way. 
Thankfully my mother-in-law was the one who waited in line for them, not me!

It's certainly a novelty so if you have absolutely nothing better to do than wait in line by the gross bus depot for a few hours, go for it. Just don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"I thought I was going to try this place out after the hype (which I still don't get why is still happening), but a turn of events ended up in me going yesterday.

I got in a relatively \"shorter\" line at around 3:20 pm and got our cake at 4:35 pm. When we finally got inside the store, we realized why it takes so long to get a cake. 
1) The employees work at a glacial pace- and it doesn't help that they're friends so you see them talking and working at the same time, which slows everything down. I saw one of the employees placing liners into the trays at such a slow speed, it's unbelievable (but believable cause SERVICE IS SO SLOW).
2) There are three ovens that can bake 12 cakes at a time, but they were only using two ovens for some ridiculous reason.
3) The system and management here is horrible. If you know that there is consistently a long line up, pre-bake cakes! Pre-prep all the batter! These are things that can be done beforehand and will make your business so much more efficient. It shouldn't take this many months to realize that your way of working is bad for your business and a horrible treatment to your customers.

And then we get into the hygienic issues:
1) All of the employees deal with cooking materials with their hands, and thus should wash them frequently and before they begin work. I did see most of them do that, but one female employee came from outside- touched the door handles and everything- and proceeded to work without washing her hands.
2) They mix the raw cake batter with their bare hands?! I find that pretty gross. I looked over to see the employee with her arm up to her elbow in the batter just mixing and mixing. At least wear gloves, PLEASE.

They should really provide some sort of customer service- maybe give a snack or some water to the customers that line up for hours. I think that would be nice. I also wish they would come out every now and then to tell us when the next batches of cake are out, so we at least have an idea of how much longer we need to wait in line. In the summer or in the rain, I don't know how these lines will turn out- they should provide some sort of shade or shelter for them to stay under. 

Overall, the $10 6-inch cake tasted good- but nothing you can't find anywhere else. You can get the same taste at chinese bakeries. It's like you put the word Japanese in front of cheesecake, and it becomes this whole magical must-try thing. I am also disappointed that they think what they serve are \"madeleines\"; those are just cakes in cupcake-like wrappers.

Won't be back- cake, service, and long line-up aren't worth it at all."}
{"text":"I like the cheesecake here, it's very fluffy. I prefer it warm but a lot prefer if it's refrigerated a little bit like traditional cheesecake.  Also you don't have to wait a very long time anymore during certain times. If you go during the week in the early afternoon, you wait only 10 mins. The price is reasonable- 8.88$ for a full cake. The service is nice as well."}
{"text":"The cheesecake is super fluffy and soft. I loved it! Having said that, I would only go through the process of lining up if I was either in the area or had some to kill"}
{"text":"After months of waiting I finally got to try this legendary cheese cake. It definitely lives up to its hype but if you have to wait more than 60-90mins it's probably not worth it (in my opinion) because they only let you buy one cheese cake at a time due to the long line of people they have to serve, which is fair but if your an Oliver Twist like me, it's annoying
Overall good serve, lovely lovely cheese cake really different from the norm"}
{"text":"Despite seeing the huge lineup I really felt the urge to try the cheesecake! (I'm already a food fan and love everything Japanese) My brother got us the original cheesecake and the green tea cheese cake (that had red beans in them) I also got to try madeleines which were sooo good! They had more flavour than the cheesecake but werent as soft.. more of like cupcakes/muffins. Recommend if you ever want to try a different type of cheesecake (They are actually good for the price! I have tried making them myself and they were difficult and took a lot of work and ingredients!)"}
{"text":"The taste is okay. It's not something worth waiting 3 hours in line for. I'm glad I did it in 15mins."}
{"text":"3.5

Came back last Sat with the BF to try the items from the Uncle Tetsu's Japanese Matcha Café side. Stopped by around 6:20pm and the line for the Matcha Café side was only half as long as the Uncle Tetsu side. We were in and out in just over 20mins, which is not too bad of a wait.

Both the Cheesecake and the Madeleines were offered in Matcha flavour alone or Matcha with Red Beans. The BF and I each got our own Matcha Cheesecake with Red Beans ($8.85). I'm actually not a big fan of red beans, but I thought that seemed more unique than just plain Matcha flavor. I regret not getting just the plain Matcha Cheesecake now. The first time I ate the cake, I took a giant bite and got nothing but red bean flavor. The red bean completely overpowered the matcha flavor and I couldn't taste it at all. I left half the cake for the next day, and I made sure to eat a bit from the top this time, just to try only the matcha flavor. The matcha flavor was there this time, and it was pretty good. The red beans at the bottom of the cake also caused a tiny layer of cake surrounding the red beans to be slightly undercooked. In general, I found the matcha cheesecakes to be slightly denser than the original version. It is also slight smaller in size, compared to the original. 

We also got a Mixed (Green Tea & Milk) Soft Served Ice Cream in a Cup ($3.99) to share. This soft serve is slightly more icy than the usually soft serve I'm used to. The green tea had good flavor, but the milk didn't have much flavour. Next time I would stick to the green tea only. I decided to skip the Madeleines this time, as I found the original ones slightly dry last time.

I'll definitely be back, but I'll most likely stick with the Original Cheesecake. They are the same price, but the Original Cheesecake is bigger, so it feels more worth it for the price. If the line for the Matcha Café isn't too long, I might come back to try the Matcha Cheesecake. Also interested in trying their Matcha Latte as well."}
{"text":"Super yummy chessecake!  If your palate for dessert requires cups of sweetness, you may be disappointed after your wait."}
{"text":"Food *** - Service ****- Ambience ****

The green tea Madelines are quite good. But I feel you shud space them out over a few months. They can get boring very quickly."}
{"text":"I enjoy their food and price but I will never wait longer than 20 min for it. 

Uncle Tetsu Food: I've had the original cheesecake, Angel hat, and honey madeleine. I find the cheesecake and angel hat to be very similar in taste, it seems like the only differences are the shape and the angel hat is ever so slightly fluffier (I guess from being crust less?). I would choose having the cheesecake instead because it's easier to slice and share. Both cakes are airy and just melt in your mouth from how silky the texture is. They hardly weigh anything so you'll hardly feel it at the tip of your fork. The flavour that sticks out most is a ricotta cheese (?) taste. It's very light so try not to drink anything cold/hot or eat something too flavorful before eating the cake or you'll find it flavour less. The madeleines are very different but still tasty - they are sweet and have a thicker cake texture. I wouldn't come here just for Madeleines though. 

Matcha Cafe Food: I was very eager to try the matcha soft serve since I really enjoy matcha in general. But to my disappointment, I felt the soft serve was more of a sorbet. The cone began melting before it was even handed to me. It tasted like it was made from frozen water rather than milk/cream. And the flavour was really lacking, I could hardly find the matcha flavour even after tasting it carefully. The soft serve definitely didn't go well with the flavour of the cone too. I think the cone had a more distinct flavour than the soft serve. My friend and I agreed that it wasn't worth the wait and we most likely won't be back to try it again. 

Service: While you line up you get the opportunity to see the staff prepare and cook all the food through the windows. The staff are friendly and quiet. Expect to wait a while for anything you order though. There is always a line no matter what the weather is like. 

Why only 3 stars? I like the cakes and the price is definitely on point but I don't find them that special to go out of my way to order. I'll usually only stop here if it's en route to somewhere else I have to be. And the line ups can be ridiculously long. On an average day I won't stop if I see the line is longer than 10-15min. The food isn't that amazing for me to wait more than 20min tops. 

Refrigerated or not? I prefer it NOT refrigerated. I find that after it gets cold, it no longer remains silky smooth. The cold makes the cake more solid and somehow loses some of its flavour as well. I'd rather leave it out for one night if I know it will be finished the next day."}
{"text":"Yes, I was one of the idiots who had lined up for a Uncle Tetsu cheesecake (in July, just got around to posting a review now). Luckily, I did not have to wait too long (40 minutes of my life) and it was a nice sunny day...so no complaints about that part. The cheesecake itself was light and fluffy. I had personally liked it as it was a nice change from the dense traditional cheesecake that we are all familiar with, but others may think that it is a bit too spongy. Ah well.....can't please them all. I had really enjoyed it, but honey, I am not waiting in line again for a damn cheesecake no matter how good it had tasted (especially on the next day and served with fresh raspberries!!) I had also tried the madeleines (matcha and original) and I was not a huge fan of them. Sorry!"}
{"text":"This review is for the matcha cafe that opened next to the original Uncle Tetsu shop.  I was interested in finding out what they had to offer as there was practically no line up, whereas the original shop had a line up that was at least 2 hours long.  I was so excited to see green tea cheesecake on the menu, but alas, they will not be available until August!  The only items they were actually selling were green tea madelines and soft serve.

THE MADELINES
They had a great crunchy top and a soft moist centre. It was a beautiful green colour inside and tasted of matcha.  I wouldn't say they were the best thing ever, but it was certainly tasty, and with a less than 5 minute wait, I wouldn't mind getting them again.  I've never had the madelines from the original shop, but I'm not willing to get in line for more than 1 hr again just to try them and compare.

MATCHA SOFT SERVE
The last time I had matcha soft serve was in Japan 5 years ago.  I was excited to have it again, especially on a beautifully warm summer day!  At $3.99 with a run of the mill cone, I felt the price was a bit steep.  The ice cream was creamy and had a distinct matcha flavour, but the blah cone didn't do anything to elevate the ice cream.  I feel that at this price, they should at least give us a better quality cone.

I will definitely go back at some point, especially to get a matcha cheesecake, as long as the line up isn't as crazy as the line up next door.  I lined up at the original shop for more than 1 hour several weeks ago, and I felt like it was the biggest waste of time.  The cheesecake didn't even taste as good after the ridiculous line up left a sour taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I've been to Uncle Tetsu's many times and have gotten a variety of their products. 
I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake but this is probably my favourite cheesecake, because it doesn't have the usual dense and thickness of normal cheesecake: it has a more lightness to it. I've also had their Matcha cheesecake which I would say is slightly worse than their normal cheesecake as the Matcha flavour isn't very significant. I just liked the red beans that were at the bottom of the Matcha cheesecake. Their madeleines were pretty good but probably not worth the price that I paid for them. Last but not least, their matcha soft serve ice cream is awesome! Probably my favourite matcha ice cream!"}
{"text":"The debate of waiting in line for an Uncle Tetsu cheesecake or to not wait was what took me so long to actually try it out. For starters, they open at 7am. So, if you're up early, I would suggest heading there a little earlier to avoid all the human traffic and lineups. 

As for the cheesecake itself, I preferred eating it fresh, right out of the oven. Also tried it after it was fridged for a little over an hour. When it was fresh, it was a lot more fluffier and more unique. But once it was fridged, the taste and texture was much closer to a typical cheesecake. Yes, it was good, but for an hour wait, not so much. The texture and taste was significantly better than one you can pick up from T&T or Foodie.

My recommendation is that if the line is short, go for it. If it's any longer than an hour, try your luck again next time.

Cash only."}
{"text":"Overrated. Somehow made it into this place after only 20 minutes of lining up, which apparently is a world record. 

Suggestion: go with a friend, and don't eat the cake fresh; it tastes better after you put it in the fridge."}
{"text":"It seems like a very typical example of hunger marketing to me. My boyfriend and I were informed the waiting time is at least one and a half hours first time we wanted to try so we gave up. This time we lined up for 40mins. However, when it was finally our turn, we were told that all cakes were sold out and we had to wait for another 20 minutes. (No way for us to leave at that point. ) The cheesecake is fine, very light and fluffy indeed but not worth one hour of my life for it."}
{"text":"My bf is a huge fan of cheese and cheese related foods.  We both tried the famous Uncle Tetsu cheesecake and thought it was really meh.  Kind of bland and texture is soft and loose.  Kinda boring."}
{"text":"If you like really robust cheesecake that is creamy and a strong cheesecake flavour this is not something I would waste my time waiting in line for. It was very underwhelming. Fluffy yes, but way too light for my taste. Will never stand in line again.. It's approximately an 1hr or longer wait."}
{"text":"Had to see what the hype was all about. Had a friend line up (15 mins..not bad!)to grab 1 cake for all of us to try. The cake was not at all what I was hoping it would be. Would I line up again... def. not."}
{"text":"I didn't wait in line- a friend did. The muffins were very average. Overly eggy and dry. The cheesecake was tasty and a refreshing departure from traditional American cheesecake. Very light and eggy with a hint of lemon. I'd say a cross between a sponge cake and a creme caramel. Again, very tasty but definitely not worth waiting in line for. To each their own!"}
{"text":"I'm always excited when a new food establishment pops up, especially if it involves affordable treats that satisfy my sweet tooth (I love desserts way too much)!  When I heard about Uncle Tetsu, I was immediately curious and happy to find out that it was located only a short walk away from Dundas Station.  But...the lineups!!  I've never had the patience to endure long lines for anything...I abandon my merchandise if I can count more than 10 people in front of me.  

So, I thought, \"I'll go when the hype dies down\"...except that it never did!  I was ready to accept that I would probably never try this cheesecake (oh well), until I noticed on a morning walk that there were only about 4 people outside the door - what?!  In the end, I only had to wait for 10 minutes or less to get inside and pay for my cheesecake...although it did feel like much longer due to the heat radiating from the oven.

I decided to bypass the madeleines...after all, the cheesecake was supposed to be the main attraction, and the price came out to an even $10 with tax (if I remember correctly!), while the madeleines (3 plus a 4th thrown in for free) + cheesecake amounted to around $17.  
While simple, Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake was very yummy!  It was soft, moist, and fluffy (and pretty addictive!...I kept cutting myself an extra piece!), and had a sort of \"foam-like\", spongy quality...whereas NY cheesecake is very dense, thick, and creamy.  If you're the type of person who prefers richer desserts, you might be disappointed by Uncle Tetsu's.  However, I would definitely stop by again for another!  Also, with Uncle Tetsu's Matcha Cafe having just opened up next door, it sounds like they are expanding to offer more yummy options.

*go in the morning/noon to avoid long lineups!"}
{"text":"Cheesecake is so fluffy and its freshly made right in from of you. if you eat it right away after purchasing while it's still warm it tastes like sponge cake. Put it in the fridge overnight and have it the next day then it taste more like cheesecake. I prefer to eat it after it had been refrigerated. 

the line up however is crazy! Doesn't matter what time you go, there is always a line up. they are open at 7am, a few Sundays ago, I got there at 7:15am thinking I will be able to get in and out of there within 30 mins max but I was wrong. There were already at least 30 people in line in front of me. I heard the first person in line went at 6:15am to line up. The cheesecake is good but I am not walking to wake up at 5:30am on a weekend just to line up for a cheesecake. I will definitely purchase another one but I will only do it after the hype has died down and no more 2 hours line ups!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a case of preference, I suppose if you want a cheesecake that tastes like egg and nothing else, and has a very weird texture, enjoy. However I prefer my cheesecake to have flavour and sweetness. I do not understand the hype at all, but if you have had before and like, then this is a good location as it doesn't have the long lines I've heard other people complain about."}
{"text":"We arrived around 10:30 am on a weekday and were lucky to find no line!
We purchased 3 Japanese Cheesecakes. We devoured one and saved two to take on our flight back to Vancouver. The cakes definitely taste better after refrigerating overnight. They would definitely find a market on the westcoast!"}
{"text":"Now open 8:00am NOT 7:00am

First, just wanted to let everyone know that they changed their hours as of Oct 1 and are open 8:00am - 11:00pm. I checked Yelp's website before making the trek there and as of today, they had a 7:00am open on the site and discovered when I got to the store, the hours had changed. 

With that said, I've had Uncle Tetsu's only once before when it first opened. Personally, I like the cheesecake as I'm not a fan of American cheesecake. Like others describe, it's lighter, fluffier, and far less sweet than American cheesecake. I especially like the presentation as you would expect from any Japanese store, it is beautifully packaged in a thicker cloth, then box, then bag. 

In terms of popularity though, I work with a number of Japanese partners and when I met with them last mentioned how we now have an Uncle Tetsu's here. They never heard of Uncle Tetsu's before (though they are all Tokyo based and there aren't any stores in Tokyo) but still, I would think that at least one of the seven people there (who travel all over Japan) would have heard of it. They thought it was hilarious about how we would line up for hours to buy one."}
{"text":"Tried this yesterday at Front Street Foods. LOVED the cheesecake and so did my friends. My only complaint is that they no longer sell whole cheesecakes but I'll be back for a 1/4 ;)"}
{"text":"The cheesecake is really lovely.   More like a soft pillowy souffle than a typical cheesecake.   I only had to wait 25 minutes before I had one in my hands and was happy with my purchase/decision.  Had I waited 1-2 hours I think I would have been dissatisfied.  I doesn't seem like it would be too hard to bake one yourself after a bit of trial and error."}
{"text":"After a long day of walking around and looking for attractions, My friends and I stumpled into this place and it turn out to be the perfect spot for a great meal.

The industry exists & is surviving because of people like the owner there. Excellent service and along with everything else.

All in all, great place and we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Two friends of mine had recomended this place to me,  raving about the amazing cheesecake and the angel hat. But after one hour of lining up to order just one of them, I started to wonder if it was worth it...
 I have many issues with this business and product, the linup is nonsensical, they only have one oven doing just one batch of cakes at a time so you basically have to wait for the other batch to bake. This is a problem that reflects the bad management behind the business, they can easily put a second oven that would make them more profit and customers more happy. 
Anyways... my friend wanted you buy a cheesecake for her mom's birthday so we waited. After ordering we are told we can only have one per person and if we want more we have to line up again. WHAT??! What if I am extremely hungry?! And the cake is not big enough for many people to eat. 

I purchase the awaited cheesecake and pray to the heavens that it was worth my time. But  dissapointment is an understatement to what I am feeling right now. The cake is simply tasteless, a bluff of egg with a minimal hint of cheese far in the background, almost like a cheese aftertaste. It is not disgusting, it simply is nothing, unremarkable, extremely underwhelming...

If you want a cheesecake that tastes like cheese, or that tastes like something at all, do NOT purchase here. Just take a straight spoonful of Philadelphia cream cheese . It will be a 100 times better I guarantee you . 
Too much hype for a baked cloud of eggs."}
{"text":"i'm addicted to those cheesecakes! i've yet to try the green tea menu, but that will change soon!"}
{"text":"Soft and not too sweet cheesecake.  I like the matcha one better.  However I don't think it is worth a wait any longer than 15 min."}
{"text":"This is going to be slightly weird for a review, but contrary to the name of the shop, I'm a bigger fan of the madelines than the actual cheesecake.

So some definitions:

Madeline: small format cakes with a slight crispiness on the outside with a spongy interior

Cheesecake: different from North American standard of cheesecake (i.e. not NY-style). It is spongy, light and quite cheesy in texture. It is more delicate than the cheesecakes we (North Americans) are used to. It also uses less sugar so its not as sweet.

The lineups are usually long so factor in about 1hour to 2hours for the line. The limits are 4 madelines/person and 1 cheesecake/person. If you want more, just get a good non-complaining friend stand with you for the duration of the wait.

If you take the cheesecake home, do try it out with other recipes like adding ice cream or some strawberry pie filling. Maybe other people can mention what they experimented with and found enjoyable."}
{"text":"Love the matcha latte and soft serve ice cream!! The latte sizes are on the small side but it's so smooth and rich.

The matcha shop doesn't seem to be as popular as the original shop so you don't have to line up for the matcha cheesecakes as they usually have a batch ready on the counter."}
{"text":"Service was so bad, after waiting almost 40 mins in the cold, they said one cheesecake each person (we were supposed to buy 3 altogether and 2 people). There was no where mentioned on the window, one chesecake each person). They are short staffed, and bad service!! The cheesecake does not make up for it"}
{"text":"Its really amazing how every time I go there, there will always be a queue. It definitely says something about the reputation and perhaps quality of the cakes. Got the matcha cheesecake with red beans as I prefer the matcha flavour and the texture as compared to the original cheesecake. The queue for the matcha flavoured cakes is much shorter, so if you're rushing for time, try heading to the shop beside to get the cheesecake. Also tried the matcha soft serve ice cream at $4.50 which I thought tasted okay, nothing special to comment about. Overall, I would say stick to the cakes and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Besides from the crazy line up that I witness every time I pass by, it never fails to amaze me how far people will go to get a cheesecake.

To be honest I probably went in it with the wrong mindset, I've always loved the creamy richness and the slight tanginess of a classic New York cheese cake, but a Uncle Tetsu cheesecake is far from that. It is 80% fluffy sponge cake and 20% cheesecake.

While the cheese is hardly detectable at first, the after taste of this cake reminds me of a milky creamy delight. The texture of the cake is something that I am very fond of. I do have to admit that the technique that goes in to making this cake is quite impressive, I would assume that the fluffiness comes from beaten egg whites, while it maintain the lightness of the cake, preventing the cake from caving after taken out of the oven is a different story. 

Overall, quite unique experience, I did not finish the cake that is a indication of how much I enjoyed it. (not very much I suppose). Although the price is quite affordable, $10 for a cake. I would get is again under only one circumstance- NO LINE UP!"}
{"text":"It seems they were more conscious of quality when they first opened. Back then only perfect cake were sold, now if a cake has a crack it's still sold. Not that it changes the taste, but ascetically it's different. 

I like to put mine in the fridge, and it becomes a bit firmer."}
{"text":"Just wanted to start off by saying this is not American style cheesecake, so it can not be reviewed by that comparison. That seems to be the misconception in some of the other reviews. Now for the review.

After hearing all the hype about this place, I went to try it out. I went on a Sunday afternoon around 3pm and the wait in line was just over an hour. I picked up 2 cheesecakes and 4 Madelines.

I had a piece of the Japanese cheesecake while it was still warm and it tasted good. It tasted like butter and eggs, and a mild hint of cheese flavor. It wasn't what I was expecting, but it was acceptable. Now the second one, I had kept in the fridge for a few hours, so it was nicely chilled. I was expecting the same flavors and was surprised. It tasted amazing!!! Perhaps being in the fridge allowed everything to settle and meld together. It had a much firmer texture yet still retaining the fluffiness. Instead of the buttery and eggy taste, it is replaced with a strong, creamy cheese flavor. It hit the right spot and what I wanted from the cheesecake.

Now the Madelines, I'd say keep away from those. Hot or cold, they were very sweet and very dry. Its like a sponge cake with a toasted crust. If you do eat one, I would suggest having a glass of water nearby.

Overall it was good and I would recommend the Japanese cheesecake. For the price you pay, I felt it was worth it. I would go back and have another when I'm downtown again. The Madelines were disappointing. Well, maybe it was just a bad batch I got since I have read others have enjoyed it. Next stop, Matcha Cheesecake!"}
{"text":"This place is all about quality. You really have to try it to understand why people are willing to wait up to two hours just to purchase this one per customer, six-inch, $10 Japanese cheesecake. If you look up the brand, it is all over Asia and people wait in line even years after the store opening. What that says about this product is that it comes down to quality and not just hype."}
{"text":"I waited 2.5 hours last Sunday. Had a slice the day of and wasn't impressed with the taste but after chilling it in the fridge it tastes much better :)"}
{"text":"It is a light, fluffy cake with a slight taste of mascarpone cheese.  My coworker described it like a \"souffle\" in texture or a \"custard\"; I didn't think it was that pudding-like, but it is certainly soft.  This is not your western-style cheesecake with a graham cracker crumble crust and thick cream cheese filling with fruit topping.  Cost is $10 for a 6-inch cake, limit one per person.  Not worth lining up for two hours exposed to the unpredictable Toronto weather, but it is great to pick up early in the morning as your contribution to a friend's potluck in the evening.  If your position in line is at the doorstep, that will still be a 20-30 min wait depending on how fast the batch is being made.

Uncle Tetsu also offers a Matcha Cafe next door.  This is the powdered green tea that is mixed into a variety of products, such as a slushie, soft-serve twist ice-cream, and madeleines.  The madeleines come in original (no filling, only matcha flavoured) or red-bean filled matcha.  I prefer the red-bean matcha, my coworker liked the original.  Both are good, but I found the originals tended to have some dry spots.  There will be a matcha cheesecake coming this month, but it isn't there yet.  You can buy the madeleines four for $9 (buy three, get one free) or a single for $2.68.  The line-up (if any) at the Matcha Cafe is way shorter and faster than the cheesecake line, so feel free to walk in.  You can't buy the cheesecake in the Matcha Cafe, but you can get consolation madeleines faster, so it's still a nice item to bring to a potluck.

Take heart if you don't want to line up for two hours to get a tiny little cake.  Uncle Tetsu is expanding with a factory underneath their current location and word is they plan to offer online ordering as well.  They also have a stand at Front St next to Union Station which sells slices of the cheesecakes (they tend to sell out by noon).  They will keep the Front St stand permanently as well.

Oh, and Uncle Tetsu is a real person!  You can get a selfie with him if you wish, like a celebrity photo.  It seems he oversees his Toronto operation personally here and I saw him training the staff."}
{"text":"I had to come here because of all the hype and the fact that I work across the street. Experienced the 1.5 hour lineup on a sunny Friday afternoon in June. The cheesecake is nothing special, but it is good. However, there are many Asian bakeries that make Japanese cheesecake that tastes the same, if not better, than tetsu's (pro tip: go across the street into the atrium for a good bakery!) 

Ugh just don't do it unless there isn't a line, which seems to be unlikely in the near future."}
{"text":"I don't get the fuss. A Dr. Oetker frozen cake is just as good. 

It's fine, I guess."}
{"text":"A pretty good Japanese cheesecake. Texture was light and fluffy. It was not too sweet. 
Is it the best Japanese cheesecake in Toronto...yes. 
Would I wait in line 2 hours for this...no, but if you're in the area and the line up isn't ridiculous then give it a try."}
{"text":"45 minutes wait. 
I was intrigued by the continuous long lines. The cheesecake fed my curiosity. It's served warm and is super fluffy. Everybody who lives or visit Toronto should go, at least once."}
{"text":"Please someone... explain to me how this is an amazing place?  

For a while I worked across the street from this cake shop, and would watch people line up for their cake(s). Months went by and I expected the lines to fall off... but no. Everyday for a year there were lines.

Now the best part of working in the neighbourhood and having sightlines of the storefront. I could run down last minute and grab a cake when the line was short to none (and it does happen). From watching on the outside... the idea of lining up for these cakes was silly. 

... But those cakes!?!?!... They are quite tasty.  Now I wouldn't say they're over the moon tasty, but they definitely have a delicate balance of fluffy cake and cream and everything delicious. 

Would I recommend these cakes to anyone? Probably the more adventurous would wait.  But in all honesty, I would only suggest visiting when the opportunity creates itself.  The cakes are good... but not 45 minutes of waiting good."}
{"text":"Pillowy soft buttery Japanese cheese cake. A bit pricey though. Not worth a long wait but we were lucky the line was short when we passed by and that's why we decided to try it ( ended up waiting about 15 mins). Their Madeleine's are ok but not as much as the cheese cake."}
{"text":"I got the Angel hat matcha and the normal cheese cake. The normal jap cheese cake was fairly good, fluffy soft and tasty. But my mom kinda makes the same type of cake. So I wasn't too surprised. The angel hat, however, is too soft that as soon as I cut it it fell apart. It was soggy and wet. 

It could've been 4 stars since there was no wait (only 1 customer in front of me) and the staff is super nice and friendly. But I decided to give 3 only because it didn't live up to its hype and wow me with the cake."}
{"text":"So jealous this is in Toronto and not in NYC. A really nice dessert since it isn't sweet. Not too cheesy and has a light and spongy texture. Really love this. Can eat this during the day or at night. A very versatile dessert."}
{"text":"Ever since that first bite of their fresh japanese cotton cheesecake it was a shock. it was like eating foam, oh my god was it not cook through? Nope, it's like that. Waiting inline for two hours was honestly rather awful because what i got in return was a disappointing product and $11 less. I felt really silly waiting two hours . I was just one of those sheep...

Pros in getting uncle tetsu's cakes : 
1) It's fresh and they have a high turn over period and their logo is adorable. However, for the best experience you would have to wait one over night to stored in a fridge.  
2) It saves you an hour and 30min worth of time making it yourself. Which it is possible if you google an japanese cotton cheese cake recipe. Way better texture and tastes just as good.

Cons in getting uncle tetsu's cakes:
1) long wait time for a least 2 hours (even during a rain storm)
2) texture of the cake: it was soggy and eating airy foam
3) the colouring on the cheesecake is inconsistent
4)NOT able to eat it right away and you will have to wait a couple of days. So the texture can become more dense."}
{"text":"We had a chance to try the cheesecake and Madelaines a couple of weeks back. Like others have commented, it's not your typical american style cheesecake. This one is much lighter and fluffier. We tried it both ways: room temperature and cold. While I enjoyed the cheesecake either way, my wife much preferred it at room temperature. She describes it as (now imagine Margo's voice from Despicable Me) \"It's so fluffy!!!\" 

I would given it a higher rating, but we had to wait 1.5 hrs in line.

Tip - make sure to bring cash as they don't accept any other forms of payment at this time."}
{"text":"Super yummy! Awesome to share with friends and family. I came in the afternoon and not too long of a line, waited about 45 mins.

 I was shocked that a fat shaming woman from the gym curves came trying to sign everyone in the line up! Are you saying we are eating too much cake?"}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth goodness. Waited in line for 15 min at 9:30 am on Wednesday. Good time to go!"}
{"text":"It's okay - eggy soft cheesecake.  Wouldn't go out my way for it - not really worth the wait."}
{"text":"Over hyped.
So I was walking by Union Station early this summer and there were a bunch of food tents there.  Uncle Tetsu so happen to have a stand there and there was no line up.  

So I thought \"hey, might as well see what the hype is about\" since there was no line...I hate waiting in lines and would never have stood in line for one.

Turns out the thing tastes like a fancy sponge cake.  It was kinda smooth and light, but it was nothing special.

Anyone ever watch that Friends episode with the cheesecake?  I was expecting something like that...something soooo good I would eat it off the ground if I dropped it.

If you want a good sponge cake, go here.  But for a cheese cake??  I think not."}
{"text":"Had the one at front street and it tasted like those Chinese buns from chinatown.  Was strange but good.  I prefer it colder in all honesty.  I'd give it 3.25/5"}
{"text":"Terribly overrated due to long lineups everyday,  we decided to lineup to finally checkout the hype and unfortunately looks like that's all it is. The cake was not particularly good, it's not bad just do not expect what we know as cheesecake. It is after all branded as Japanese Cheesecake because it is very different; not sweet at all, very soft and spongey with a strong eggy taste. I have a sweet tooth and I'm not a fan of eggs so this was not for me."}
{"text":"There was no waiting. Lucky me! The cheese cake is so tasty. I personally like it cold. The cream cheese flavour becomes more pronounced. The texture is slightly denser."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Cheesecake but personally i didn't enjoy the wait time. Way over-hyped!"}
{"text":"Four stars because of the wait as compared to the quality.  We waited about 15  minutes. The cheesecake was very light and a bit eggy.  But coming from New York, it wasn't creamy enough.  Still I loved how light it was and I would get it again if there is no wait. The Madeleines were really good - nice and orangey."}
{"text":"Nothing special.... Don't understand all the hype and long line ups..."}
{"text":"Over hyped and over priced. Eating the cheese cake is like eating a light sponge made of pure butter. Either you love it or you don't."}
{"text":"My gf really really wanted to try 'Japanese Cheesecake', so we trek out here to downtown and waited in line outside under minus 5 degrees for a good 45 mins before we're finally inside, in which we waited another 1 hours or so before we got our batch of one cheesecake 6 inch per person and one set of 4 of madeleine for the price of $27.60...

Madeleine- Cupcake size with a hint of vanilla and honey flavoured. Tasted nice, but a tad dry for us. If you bought one its priced at $2.22, buy three get one free deal.

We got their famous 6 inch Japanese Cheesecake for the price of $8.88 plus tax equals to $10. Like Yelpers mentioned, its light, fluffy, a hint of sweetness. You really get that eggy taste. Its definitely different compared to most cheesecake. It has not addictives and stuff. The angel hat was not available. Also, they pride in their work so if its not up to standard, they make a new batch...Talk about quality!

We also took selfie with Mr. Uncle Tetsu himself, who is here from Japan just to check things out..So its pretty rare to meet a store owner that has lots business in Asia and still around to keep his business strong. They also have young, cute, polite Japanese girls making batches and stuff...

My gf is still wanting more, but I'm more inclined to wait til the wait is over...It was definitely a good buy though.

FYI- At this time they only accept CASH!!!"}
{"text":"I was fortunate to catch the line at one of it's shorter lengths. The shop smelled amazing with the scent of freshly baked cheesecake, and I was looking forward to seeing what all the hype was about. That's unfortunately all it really is for me, hype. Sadly frozen cheesecake from a grocery store tasted better than the one that I purchased that day. It is unique and definitely a different take on the standard cheesecake. I'd save the line up and disappointment and grab a dessert somewhere else."}
{"text":"Literally the best cheesecake I have ever tasted. Light and fluffy, as though you are flying in air. Beware... lineups can be very long so come early and be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Amazing cheesecake! I waited in line and it was totally worth the wait. Sooo good. I also tried their Angel Hat original cheesecake, a small sized one for 10.00. It was really moist in texture and a bit different from the original cheesecake but still just as good. Then headed over to their match store for some Madeleines which where tasty for breakfast. =)"}
{"text":"Cheesecake is my favorite desert and this is my new favorite cheesecake. I used to instantly reply Cheesecake Factory strawberry cheesecake whenever anyone would ask my favorite.  Now I will not even think about that other place.

It has this fluffiness and exact level of sweetness that makes it perfection.  Run here."}
{"text":"Must try. Worth the wait. Yes they only bake a dozen every 15 minutes. The aroma slowly builds up during that time to drive u crazy. The texture is different fresh out of the oven versus when it's cooled, so don't be greedy and leave half for later!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious cheesecake...like nothing I've ever had before. Hands down perhaps one of the best things I've ever shoved into my talk hole. Uncle Tetsu is a superstar!!"}
{"text":"i'm a fan of this style of dessert, its light and fluffy and just slightly sweet. it's an asian bakery after all so those who are very familiar with american style desserts be wary of this! i wouldn't personally line up for so long for it, otherwise once in a while i think it'd make a great hosting gift if you are visiting friends/family."}
{"text":"If you can get here when the line is short, this is A+. Japanese cheesecake is a lot lighter than western cheesecake. You can basically pick it up with your hands and eat it like bread, but it's still sweet and mild. I love love love the cheesecake, the madelines are also on point, etc. Can't wait for them to start doing delivery / online ordering."}
{"text":"Unreal cheesecake. I had REALLY high expectations based on previous reviews and the 2 hour lines. I waited in line for only 30 minutes and was blown away. I enjoyed that it is not the traditional rich and heavy cheesecake flavour, but more of a light and fluffy version. A must try!"}
{"text":"After having plenty of cheesecakes in Japan (more than I should have) I was excited to learn I could find it here so I lined up for 1.5 hours, took it home to chill and after the first bite it brought back memories but not as good as it was in my head. The thing is incredibly fluffy and good but not amazing, sadly I still prefer the ones they sell at the 7/11 in Tokyo any day."}
{"text":"The cheesecake was different than a new York style.  It was very delicious and the flavor was consistent.  Great to try. But NOT worth the 2 hour wait.  The Madeleine's were also very good. Get both if you endure the wait."}
{"text":"I haven't been there since they first opened so I don't know if there is still a line but when there was one, totally not worth the wait. It was pretty much 2 hours of waiting and we were limited to only 1 cake.

Overall the cheesecake was delicious and is definitely worth a try. It's light and has a rich taste to it. 

Hope to see new things on their menu and give it a try!"}
{"text":"I've always been curious about their cheese cake because of the long line ups. Then one day I walked by and decided to get one for myself because the line was relatively short. I waited for about 15 min, which is probably as good as it gets. However, as I was waiting, I noticed that the place had a rich and nauseating smell of oil. I also saw how they were making the cheese cakes with loads of oil and cheese and thought to myself that this is what I'll be eating later. 

When I finally tried the cake later, I could only say that it was quite underwhelming. I did like the spongy texture but the flavour was kind of off. It's not what you would expect of a normal cheese cake - not sweet enough and tasted like pure butter. 

I'll have to try their other desserts like the macha cheese cake before establishing my final opinion on this place, but their regular cheese cake will definitely not make me come back."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me, but I was underwhelmed. My bf and I wanted to try this place for a while because there was such a hype around it and there were always lineups out the door. We finally got a cheesecake, brought it home and... meh. It honestly tasted too much like eggs, though the fluffy texture was nice. We ended up throwing some chocolate icing on top to cover the egg-y taste."}
{"text":"The Wait Time:

We went on my birthday and happened on some luck as the line was quite short and the overall wait was about half an hour. We arrived just before the lunch rush, which is when I recommend you go or early in the morning because as soon as it hit close to one, the line grew exponentially. 

The Cake: 

We tried it right out of the oven and also a little later once it was chilled. The cake is very different from a traditional cheesecake, like many have already stated. It is light and spongy, a little more eggy and not so sweet. It is definitely better chilled but we both extremely enjoyed the way it tasted. If you are going to wait in line you must also get the Madeleine's. They are absolutely yummy! 

I will definitely go back but will do some early scouting before waiting in line for too long. Was able to catch a glimpse of Uncle Tetsu, which was very exciting!"}
{"text":"If you like japanese style cheese cake then this is the right place to go. Doesn't taste like the crappy japanese cheese cake you can buy from T&T. 3/5 stars because the line is just always too long."}
{"text":"BEST CHEESECAKE EVER. Well, it's not the same as the typical cold cheesecake you get from most places in North America. But essentially, Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake is the fluffiest lightest cake you will likely ever taste in your lives (if you eat it fresh right away after buying it!). As most people said, the constant lineup outside the place is the only downside as it can take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour of waiting depending on how many they have pre-prepared. I go there for the cake though, and I say sure as hell it's worth!"}
{"text":"There still a long line on Saturday after 9:00pm. Had wait for 45 mins to get the cheesecake and madeleine. When I get back to hotel start to try this with my family. Guess what? There  is NO madeleine in my bag. When I check my receipt, the charge me the item and did not put it in it!!! So you should make sure get everything before you leave!!"}
{"text":"If there was no line for 1.5hr, I would easily rate this place 5 stars but the process is bottle necked due to the number of cheesecakes they can make per hour as it takes 40 min to cook these badboys. 

The cake had a consistency of both sponge cake and cheesecake and was very light and fluffy. 

Overall, good buy very reasonably priced for the cakes for time and effort and uniqueness of the product.  dont buy madelines those are just a rip off for bread."}
{"text":"Canada always catch up with the trend ... 10 years late... And yet there are still so many to line up out of curiosity. If you do decide to line up, expect to satisfy your curiosity, but don't expect to satisfy your appetite. It is at best average."}
{"text":"Had the matcha green tea cheesecake and a Madeline. There was no line when I went (compared to the 45 min wait next door) and I had never heard of the place before so we went in with no expectations. Delicious! The cheesecake was light and almost like a sponge cake, but more moist and soft (because of the cheese). Hint of matcha. The red bean on the bottom was a great complement. Not sure I would wait 45 min, but definitely worth a try if the line is short!"}
{"text":"Not worth the wait. With novelty ending, easier to go and experience the calorie bomb goodness of Japanese cheesecake."}
{"text":"I had the matcha cheesecake. I love matcha but I didn't like this cheesecake. It tasted nothing like cheesecake, was not very sweet, tasted almost eggy. I can't believe the hype this place is getting. The staff were all talking to each other in Japanese too - which I felt was kinda rude to be doing in front of a customer."}
{"text":"My friends and I passed this place twice during our trip to Toronto and the line was out the door. We wanted what they were selling - Japanese Cheesecake! After waiting on line for 2.5 hours we went back to our hotel and the cheesecake was not good. However, I'm used to New York style cheesecake. This was light, fluffy and warm. Not me for me, but as a tourist I'm glad I tried it. 

On the other hand, the Madeleines (the muffins they make) are to dye for. Definitely get those!"}
{"text":"We arrived around 10:15 AM. We was in line for 38 minutes then 5-8 minutes more inside the store after paying for the order as the batch of cake was not ready yet.

It seems the store has been separated in 2 halves  where one sells only original (plain) with red store sign and the other sells anything with matcha with green store sign.

(On their windows, they introduced another store on Front street corner University. I'm not sure about the waiting time in line)

If you want to try both flavours, you have to buy at each store separately too. Good news: there is no line (or just 1 or 2 in front of you for their order) for the Matcha side so you can get them right away.

Now for the food:

1) Cheesecakes:
- Original: light, soft and fluffy (not as thick as western/american style cheesecake)

-Matcha: maybe because of the matcha, we could not taste the \"cheese part\" in the cake.

2) Madelaines both matcha and orginal were good (I'm more on the matcha side.) 
They also had matcha only or matcha with red bean. If you buy 3, you will get 1 extra free. And they allow to mix so you can get 2 of each type in one box to try.

3) Matcha ice-cream was not very creamy and the corn was not a generous portion for the price.

4) Angel hat was cute and the taste was good too.

All of them were not too sweet. (a +)


Try to come here before noon, the line is much shorter - but still 38 min in line for us :(."}
{"text":"Whats up guys its your boy from the hood that eats that good good. Been MIA for a little while and no, its not cause I was in jail. I was on a vacation. Let a hoodlum live a little. Anyways on to this little fluff cake that claims to be a cheese cake but really isn't.

The review guys, I give this joint a 2. A lonely 2, and it's lonely because I had to wait almost 2 hours all alone for a medium sized cake. The cake texture was alright the flavors were non-existent. I think the biggest reason why this place gets a 2 is because the cheese cake lacked any flavor, it was like eating a solid mouse pudding.

Where can I get mouse pudding that tastes almost exactly like this...hmmm, fortinos! go there and no line up. This place's slogan should be \"waste your time in line, for a disappointment\".

For all you Cheesecake enthusiasts go to future bakery that's my personal fav..."}
{"text":"Best Japanese cheesecake I've ever tried! But the wait is reallllly long....but it's worth it :)"}
{"text":"I decided to try it because I was curious. Ok not sure what the deal is with this place...it sucks!  It's a pure marketing scam. One cake per customer and stories about line ups?  Yea right. No line ups (at Union) and the cake was way below expectations.  The taste is like a weak sponge cake. Would you pay $10 for an 8 inch weak sponge cake?  Don't do it!  Go elsewhere, it's a scam."}
{"text":"We had some time to kill on my visit to Toronto and I had heard about the Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake, largely from grumpy reporters who wrote that while it was good, the line wasn't worth it. 

The cheesecake was pretty freaking delicious. It was very light and fluffy and the Uncle Tetsu stamp was an adorable touch. But as good as the cheesecake was, you absolutely cannot pass on the other offering they have on the menu - the Madeleine's. Oh man, the cheesecake was just what I expected of a Japanese style cheesecake but combined with the Madeleine's, this place blew it out of the water. The cheesecake is good to savour, but I had to stop myself from wolfing down the madelines. 

The girls who worked in there were super sweet and hardworking. When I commented on how busy it was, one of them just smiled and shrugged and said she doesn't notice because this was normal for them. 

In direct response to this \"Is the line worth it\" question that I've been getting since I survived it, I'll answer with a cop out - yes and no. Basically, how much time have you got. I love food and I love doing odd things just to say I did it. For me, this was fun and I got some delicious and reasonably priced goodies at the end. I doubt it was worth it for the groups of tourists who had their entire families with them and had to deal with kiddies with sore feet.

I probably won't be doing this regularly, but it was definitely a fun experience. I loved the place and I want to give it 5 stars, but the wait had to be taken into account. 

Bottom line: bring some good shoes, a friend and go on a day where you have plenty of time."}
{"text":"Been twice to this place already. First time I lined up for 2 hours and the second time I lined up for hour and a half. I still see people living up outside when I pass by. 

The cheesecake was really soft, fluffy and tasted really good. Very cheesecake-y except a lot softer, like pieces of cheesecake cotton in your mouth. Was it really that good? Yes, I did enjoy it. Was it worth waiting that long for it? Probably not. Unless you have great company and lots of time to kill. 

The madelaines were fantastic! Not as soft and fluffy like the cheesecake, but in my opinion they were sweater and yummier. Best eaten warm fresh out of the oven. They are really really buttery, but maybe that's why they were so good."}
{"text":"The wait in line was over an hour.  The price was $10 for a small cheesecake.  The product was edible and I would have rated it a two stars for the product.  But, when combined with the with and the price, it was only a one star experience.

My wife rated this place three stars.  She was happy to have gone to this place and tried it out and experienced something new and different.  But,she says that she will not return.

The combined rating between us is thus two stars."}
{"text":"Best Japanese cheesecake!! Long line ups, but so worth it! I recommend this place to anyone who is willing to try something new, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The waiting time for this cake is unacceptable. I haven't even tried the cake yet but I am already sure I'm not coming back. Just looking at the staff slowly moving and chatting while there is a huge line of cold people outside is just aggravating!! Yes, I chose to wait, but I'm definitely not coming back no matter how good the cake is. I've attached some pics to show the staff taking their sweet time"}
{"text":"I waited 2 hours to fulfill my curiosity. However, it was not as good as the hype. 
I wouldn't buy again even if there is no line up... It wasn't that tasty. It takes 45 min to bake 12 cakes and the staffs there seemed very relaxed despite of people waiting outside in snow... I think the service and structure could improve as there was 1 person baking the cakes and 1 person packing the cake..."}
{"text":"My family was able to line up today because the weather was great.  lines are better during the weekdays. about 40-45mins in and out.  

cheesecake is a hybrid sponge and cheesecake cost 10$ each.  limit 1 person. it was OK nothing great but not that bad. it was a texture I wasn't use too. I would only come back when the hype is gone. 

Madeline's are the only second option in place.  cost is 2.33 each buy 3  get 1 free. I prefer this over the cheesecake. light buttery moist flavour cake. 

tip: try during the weekdays and get both cheese cake and Madeline's. then decide.  Cash ONLY"}
{"text":"The cake is great and soft and fresh and warm and special. The line up is ridiculous although it has got better, and early in the day you may actually not get a line up.  If you are passing by and see that there is no line up then certainly stop by, but don't go there just for the cake which will definitely not worth the wait. 
It was a 5 star if there was no line up!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday morning between 9-10AM and there was nearly no line! Of course I had to take this opportunity to see what all the fuss was about. I got the cheesecake ($10) and 4 of the madeleines ($2.50 each, buy 3 get 1 free) and was very excited to try it. They were packaged very nicely in boxes and gave it to me in a bag for me to take away.

I was surprised that the cheesecake was initially warm when I received it, but I guess it makes sense since they package it relatively soon after it comes out of the oven. I took my first bite and it was SO GOOD. Super light and fluffy - so different than the thickness and heaviness of normal \"cheesecakes\" here. It tasted REALLY good! I admit I ate perhaps 1/3 of it right away ... so delicious! Then I put it into the fridge and tried it later at night after it had chilled, which tasted more like the typical \"cheesecake\" flavour I expected. Still good, but I think I prefer it warm!

The madeleines were also good - very rich in flavour. I also tried the green tea ones (both with and without red bean) from their Matcha store next door and those were also very tasty. Looks like all I have left to try is the green tea cheesecake!

Overall, well worth trying at least once because it DOES taste very good. However, I wouldn't wait that long for it, nor do I think I would have it often, because the price tag is a bit high. Still, I'm glad that I was able to go at a time when I was in and out within 10 minutes! Would definitely recommend trying if you haven't already! 4/5"}
{"text":"Overall:  Good, but not really worth the hype or long line --- especially if you're a discerning culinarian.

ONLY PLAIN FLAVOUR and whole cakes (no slices) available here.  
Go next door to sister store for any MATCHA Flavoured items.

HOURS, RULES & LINE UPS
Open everyday including Stat holidays 8am - 11pm (Opens earlier and closes later than sister Matcha Green Tea-focused store next door).
Notorious long lines are only occasional now, but still strict limit one cheesecake per customer during line ups unless you line up again or have another body w/ you.  More rules like this in their website's FAQ section, but no line up necessary for madeleines

FOOD:
Plain CHEESECAKE $10.
Much better and more moist than Matcha version (same price).  Insanely light and fluffy w/ no real crust.  Seems like way more whipped egg than cream cheese in the recipe plus they use untraditional flour and butter.  Their website describes it as \"American style,\" but this is a big departure since it lacks density, richness, and crust.  Reminds me of angel food more than cheesecake.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but let's call a spade a spade or put so called \"cheesecake\" in quotes.  I put it in the fridge and preferred it cold the next day.  Cute logo branded on the cake top.  Despite small servings, it satisfies 6-8 easily.    
 
ANGEL HAT $10 
Called Zuccotto on the receipt and box, which is also confusing since that would mean pumpkin shaped and traditionally be like a Charlotte but stuffed with ice cream or Bavarian ---- and it's not even close.  It is rather like eating a perfect dome of dense plain meringue from the top of a lemon pie except there is a slight chalkiness or starchiness.  Grana Padano cheese, custard powder, and lemon are really not noticeable.  The unusual texture is really fun to eat, but berries or a fruit sauce would help it.  No crust.  

MADELEINES  $2.21 (compare $2.65 matcha) or 4 for $6.63 
Cupcake sized, molded in a fluted round tin, unlike petite, traditional, sea shell-shaped Madeleine.  Bit more moist than sawdust-dry Matcha version, but boring and a chore to finish.  Again, flavours were not pronounced enough to be craveable.  Desperately requires a hot beverage to wash it down. The website says NO NUTS in the FAQ despite almonds being traditional.

RUSKS $5.31
You can buy rusks (think crispy biscotti or thick Melba toast), but I can't tell if they are dried versions of the madeleines or cheesecake???

PACKAGING
Their kitschy packaging with cartoon Uncle Tetsu is fun.  The Angel Hat box with handles and shiny gold cake board base is more creative as a house warming gift.  Madeleines just come in white waxed paper bags with a cute logo sticker to seal it.

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
Bit of a language barrier at both stores.  Staff were really nice, but did not understand when I said \"I want one of each\" or other simple phrases.  I recommend just giving the quantity and the item name as it appears on the menu board because I quickly learned side talk or any deviation from a basic order were not understood.  \"Just the facts ma'am.\" 

ACCESSIBILITY
Tad more space than sister store, but, again, I urge claustrophobes, those with children/ strollers, wheelchairs, canes, or walkers to largely avoid this tiny restaurant.  It simply is not safe if an able-bodied person cannot even maneuver in the cramped quarters, and it is even worse when people have their big winter coats on or when it is crowded during line ups.  Plus, there are no line up seating accommodations for those with special needs.  

NO WASHROOMS for customers.

NO PARKING:  Located next to busy downtown Bay and Dundas streets intersection.  

PAYMENT - NO CREDIT!  Cash/Debit only.  US$ at par."}
{"text":"Very long wait! Just over an hour-and honestly not really worth it! It's good but it's not worth the wait. There was a lot of hype for this but it's pretty much all bs. It's honestly just OK. kind of a mix of angel food cake and cheesecake."}
{"text":"The line up wasn't that long on a saturday or sunday morning! So had a good time eating the green tea cake. It was just as good as the normal one =)"}
{"text":"If you love cheesecake this is the Japanese version. It tastes like cream caramel, cheesecake, and vanilla cake! So soft and delicious!"}
{"text":"Well, I waited an hour and 45 minutes with some very friendly people in line on a hot Monday afternoon where I had very little else today. Let me just say that the Madeline's are amazing. Well worth the wait. Not much at first but they leave you wanting another right away. Sweet with a nice crunch around the edge. As for the cheesecake I'm on my way home to try it. It's currently warming my lap on the streetcar. Smells amazing!"}
{"text":"I love their Madeline, I found the cheesecake very good, fluffy but too cheesy... Still 4 stars though."}
{"text":"I work close to the store so my co workers I and have purchased the cake at least 3 times already. I have had Japanese cheesecake before and think that this is ok but nothing really special. The texture of the cake, for me, is more like cheese soufflé than a cheesecake. I think it's good but just not worth the wait if there's a line. Since we pass by to get it when there's virtually no lines, I think it's not a bad snack."}
{"text":"Worth the wait just to try it, but I doubt I'd wait that long again.  You have to keep in mind that this isn't your average cheesecake.  It's less sweet and lighter than the typical NY style cake, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. 

The madelines sold are also not the typical French cookie.  Their madelines are more of a cupcake and were much denser than I anticipated.  I wasn't the biggest fan of these, and wouldn't get these again.

I did love how \"cute\" everything was.  Ah, Japan, the premiere exporter of all things cute.  Would love to see Uncle Tetsu grow in Toronto with new locations - including a dine-in experience!"}
{"text":"Best eaten hot from the oven (buttery and custard-like) and cold from the fridge (heavier texture). Either way, a delicate texture with a rich taste.

I'd get this again, but after the hype dies down - not worth waiting again for more than 30 minutes. I waited for at least an hour."}
{"text":"I have been to the original Tetsu shop once and to the Matcha Cafe three or four times. I waited 1 hour and 45 min for the original cheesecake and although there was a bit of organizational confusion in carrying out my order once, I find the staff in both shops to be friendly and competent. 

The cheesecake itself can be compared to eating a tiny cloud. It is very light, airy, moist and delicate. It has a subtle sweetness that keeps you craving more. I preferred it over the denser Madeline.

Between the two shops, I never had to line up for the Matcha Cafe. On two occasions, I bought their Matcha Green Tea cheesecake with red bean which was delicious and had great texture. I highly recommend it to people who like their treats and desserts on the lighter side rather than profanely decadent. The Matcha soft serve is amazing and is something I would go back for. Not too sweet with the right amount of matcha flavouring. 

On the other hand, I also tried a Matcha slush which I was not a huge fan of, but could tolerate...the aftertaste of it reminder me of Splenda personally. 

Overall, I really like Uncle Testsu and will be trying to more of their baked treats in the future!"}
{"text":"Is it overrated? Yes. Is it delicious? Yes. Should you wait 30mins to get one? No. Just go early morning, and there is no waiting at all. Worth a try, just so you can say you have had an Uncle Tetsu cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Japanese cheesecake has a really subtle flavor and the texture is very light so I think sometimes people eat this expecting regular cheesecake, but it's nothing like it. 

Although I enjoyed the cake, it definitely wasn't worth the wait. My friend visited Japan and ate a lot of cheesecake there (she is obsessed with it) and said this cheesecake is nothing in comparison so I wouldn't eat it expecting whatever you've gotten there either. 

Service is prompt as you'd expect since there is literally a line out the door. The price is a bit pricey given the size but not surprising considering all the hype surrounding it. 

I think it's worth trying if you've never had it but only if you can walk in and walk out."}
{"text":"I might not stand in line for this, but when I went there was no wait (maybe that's over?). The cheesecake was light and eggy goodness, I would totally recommend."}
{"text":"A friend waited in line for over 45 minutes to get one. She shared; I had a few bites.

I am sure there are people who appreciate its light and fluffy texture, but sadly that did nothing for me. Tastewise, I'd say it's OK. Not too sweet, and I can detect a hint of cream-cheesiness. 

Definitely not worth waiting in line for. And personally, I would not buy it even if there was no line."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand what the fascination is about! 

I just moved to Toronto and this is one of the places people rave about and it's been featured heavily on Instagram.

I ordered a slice to share with my husband, and we were quite taken back by how bland and grainy it is.

We took two bites and threw it out! I'm glad we didn't order more!"}
{"text":"I am rating this two stars because it's my fault I was expecting delicious cheesecake. It turns out Japanese cheesecake is much different from the texture to the taste. 

The texture is spongy. The taste is very eggy. Like a sweet omelet. And there is no crust. 

Definitely not my thing. Luckily I didn't wait in line too long. 

Note they have a one cheesecake per customer limit."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, waited in line for 20 min just to learn that they have to make another batch and it will take another 15. Cmon you have to be transparent about waiting time, you are in the train station and your customers are on train schedule"}
{"text":"No more line ups luckily. Cheesecake was fluffy. I noticed it tasted a little different depending if you eat it fresh vs. In the fridge overnight. It's more cheesy overnight. But I liked the fresh ones more. How often can you eat a Cheesecake fresh?"}
{"text":"It's been 2 weeks since my last visit to the Matcha Cafe, and I decided to give this place a 2nd chance. 

There's no confusion about the buy 3 get 1 free offer today. With just a few customers ahead of me when I arrived at 3:45 pm, I was in and out in 5 mins. 

I ordered a matcha soft serve in a cup plus 4 matcha azuki madeleines. Total with taxes came to $13.50. This time my matcha soft serve tasted a lot better. The bitterness from matcha was well balanced by the sweetness in the ice cream. However, it's still not creamy like what I had in Japan. So if you like a lighter or icier version, you might enjoy it. 

No change in rating unfortunately. I have an OCD for consistency. The matcha soft serve I had today is almost 50% bigger than the skinny mini I had 2 weeks ago. If the previous one felt like a DQ small, this is almost the size of a DQ medium. 

As for the matcha azuki (red bean) madeleines, they look like they shrunk in size to fit into the new (and smaller) boxes. Also the ones I had 2 weeks ago had a lot of azuki filling - like half its depth is filled with red bean paste. Today's is perhaps less than 1/4 of its depth...  Quality control inconsistency?  Or are they cheaping it out?"}
{"text":"We noticed this shop, and you will too, when you walk by and see the crazy line at all hours of the day. You'd be perfectly correct if you said that you can get Chinese/Japanese style cheesecake at any Asian bakery. If you want to go on a lark, wait in a long line, and sweat-to-death inside while you wait longer. Go ahead. The staff are extremely pleasant and courteous, the cheesecake is delicious so it isn't time wasted."}
{"text":"Great Japanese cheesecake!

Uncle Tetsu's $10 cheesecakes are really good and definitely worth standing in line for a short while. They taste exceptionally good right after they're out of the oven and still warm, especially when the weather is cool.

Washroom rating: UNAVAILABLE"}
{"text":"Frankly, it's good. There is always a line out the door. The steaming cheesecake aroma permeates through the street corner making you want it even more. The green tea Madeline with red bra was delicious and well made. The cheesecake that people wait forever for that is sold only one per customer and whole not by slices is good. It's light, moist, well balanced and not too cheesy. For Americans, this is a much lighter version of the New York cheesecake. It's made with half the cheese and half the sugar but delicious none the same. 
It's definitely worth a try. I have to try the matcha version next time. 
My only two points are offer a slice version or a smaller cheesecake and keep it up. After 16 years of being in business, it's still rocking"}
{"text":"Meh. It's a bit of a novelty, with their light fluffy texture, but it's really not what I enjoy in a cheesecake. I went with my brother who was visiting and the lineup was less than an hour.

We both preferred it warm... It was reminiscent of a soufflé as the cake melted in your mouth.  When it was cold, it took on an odd texture and it lacked flavour. I ended up making a raspberry coulis to go on top. We also found out that about 10 sec in the microwave brings back that fluffy soufflé like texture. 

Overall, it's a nice different dessert, but I don't see myself craving it or standing in line for it."}
{"text":"Love, love, love their cheesecake. The only downside is waiting in line, but it's so worth it."}
{"text":"The cheesecake is to die for! Only downside is the huge line up to actually buy your cheesecake. We waited for about 30 minutes and you are only allowed one order per person. Also it is cash only, no plastic"}
{"text":"Just okay. Not earth shattering or super amazing like others have said. My friends really loved it and definitely thought it was worth the wait. We went around 12:30pm on a weekday, and waited in line just over an hour for our cheesecakes. 
Some people didn't realize it was only 1 cheesecake per person and were not happy!
Also, cash only - it comes to $10 per cheesecake with cash.

I don't usually love Asian desserts so I'm really not surprised I wasn't that into this cheesecake. It felt like something was missing. I just wasn't that impressed.

I wouldn't line up for it again but if someone brought me some, I'd probably still eat it.

It's light, fluffy and not too sweet. Didn't taste very \"cheesy\" to me.
I prefer traditional NY style cheesecakes!"}
{"text":"I live just a block away from this place and it's insane how long people were waiting for this cake. Definitely some sort of herd effect where you see people lining up and so you figure you ought to line up too. 

Considering how many staff they have working there and the long lines.. they really take their time.. and it's probably the least efficient bakery I have ever seen. they bake and package each cake like they're assembling a bouquet of flowers.

The cake itself is good.. it's light, airy and tastes nothing like I've had before.. like a cheese cake but also not. It's also not krispy kreme melt in your mouth I could eat an entire cake in one sitting good. Would come back more often if it didn't take so long.

Also they are cash only - who accepts cash only these days?! Get with the times."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why Uncle Tetsu is ranked 3/5 stars on YELP because it deserves more than that. Lines have definitely died down since it's opening with me waiting on 20 minutes for a cake. Given the price and it's simplicity, this cheesecake is GREAT value. Although it is an unconventional North American cheesecake, it is a great alternative to those who do not like heavy, dense and very sweet cheesecakes. I would say it's closer to a sponge cheesecake."}
{"text":"I actually really like this style of cheesecake. Normal cheesecake is too thick/heavy for me, like greek yogurt. I can't stomach Greek yogurt. Somehow I didn't have to wait in line when I got mine. I went on a Tuesday morning when I happened to have just arrived from Philadelphia on a Greyhound. 

I will definitely try out this style of cheesecake in the Chinese bakeries on Spadina, as mentioned in another review. 

Also, this style of cheesecake is normal in Japan and easily purchased."}
{"text":"I like it. It's pretty fresh and delicious. But waiting for almost two hours to get a Janpanese-style cheesecake obviously is not a good experience."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews I realize that I have been lucky to get a cheesecake in half an hour! The cheesecake has a very unusual texture and taste. It feels like you are eating something uncooked. Having said that, I think the experience is worth a try. The most interesting part was watching how they make the cake and the fact that you get freshly baked cakes. They take the cake out of the oven and put it in your box! I should also mention that the small cakes were very yummy. I would go back for those if I didn't have to wait in line"}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to try a slice of Uncle Tetsu cheesecake. The cake is very soft, fluffy, fresh and  NOT of typical cheesecake consistency. I tried it warm at first and found the flavor a bit too eggy and buttery. I also tried it as it cooled down and definitely liked it better because I could actually taste the cheese and other ingredients. Overall, it was okay, definitely not mind blowing. This cake was a bit too plain for my liking and I would have preferred it if it was a touch sweeter, as I typically like more rich desserts. I am glad that someone offered me a slice at work and that I didn't have to wait for hours to try it, because it's certainly would not be worth the wait."}
{"text":"I work down the street from this place and so recently I've been seeing the lines get even longer and more and more people toting around the little cheesecake bags, so of course like everyone else I got very curious about the hype. Picked up a couple of slices from Union Station, and quite glad we did because there was A. No line and B. You're not saddled with an entire cake to carry around. Really fluffy cake, but that's about it - its not very flavourful. Maybe it's just me, but I would never wait in line more than an hour for a cheesecake with no crust."}
{"text":"I waited in line for about 15 minutes at 10am on a Thursday morning.  

The cake looked pretty, but the middle was quite soggy and eggy.  Basically I think it was a bit undercooked.  It's a little bit disappointing given all the positive review and the hype."}
{"text":"Waited around 6 minutes. Only ordered the cheesecake and it was absolutely delicious, I almost did not want to share it with my family! I don't think this cake is for everyone though.  I depends on what you think of sweets, if you're into light, fluffy and slightly cheesy, then Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake is for you."}
{"text":"In town to buy a birthday cake for my sister,  after much reviews we decided to get a cheese cake here and definitely was not let down. 

Every bite was amazing, it's fluffy and not dry. Must come place for Japanese cheese cake."}
{"text":"Good Japanese cheesecake, but I wouldn't wait in a long line for it. There are other places in the GTA where you can get Japanese cheesecake too. However, Uncle Tetsu's was very fluffy and enjoyable - fluffier than the cheesecake I had in Japan actually if I remember correctly. I've been to Uncle Tetsu's twice now - once in the afternoon and once at around 7:30pm both on weekdays, and there was no line either time. 

For those of you who've only had western style cheesecakes in the past, I also think you need to go in with the expectation that it is NOT a \"cheesecake.\" The flavour and texture are very different and if you go in expecting a \"cheesecake\", you will be disappointed. It is still a very enjoyable cake, but much fluffier and less sweet."}
{"text":"I enjoyed it. It's a light, spongy cake as expected with a noticeable taste of cheese (it's Japanese-style cheesecake, so don't expect a dense, highly-sweet New York-style flavour). I managed to get one when the line-up was only 5 minutes long. I think it's a good cake, but absolutely not worth waiting 30-45 minutes for.

As many Yelp reviewers compared this to the Japanese cheesecake sold at T&T, here is a comparison below:

Cheesiness: T&T's is noticeably more cheesy, but not overwhelmingly.
Density of cake: T&T's is also noticeably more dense, but not overwhelmingly. Many reviewers here referred to Uncle Tetsu's as \"air-like\" and \"cloud-like.\" This is an exaggeration; the density is comparable to sponge cake served at a dim sum restaurant.
Price: I paid ~$8 for a T&T cake and $10 for an Uncle Tetsu cake. Per cake, Uncle Tetsu's is clearly more expensive. However, price is about the same based on dollars per gram.
Wait time: None whatsoever buying it from T&T vs. at Uncle Tetsu's. Also, there's no 'one-per-person' limit at T&T.
Freshness: This may be a placebo effect, but I do think Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake tastes fresher.
Presentation: Uncle Tetsu's comes in an attractive box, bag, and careful wrapping; T&T comes in an unremarkable plastic container.

If it weren't for the long lineups that are absolutely not worth the wait (google the concept of opportunity cost), I would give this restaurant a 4/5 to 5/5 in terms of quality of their cake for $10. I wouldn't buy any food items from the Uncle Tetsu next door, however; the madeleines and Matcha ice cream were quite ordinary and not worth the price."}
{"text":"I had to check this place out after reading the reviews. Fortunately there was no line when i went, although that changed quickly in the 10 mins that we were there. They were nice enough to let us sample the madeline before we bought it. So we ended up buying two matcha cakes and a madeline. 

If you're expecting a heavy new york style cheese cake thats not what you will get. It more like a cream cheese angel cake with subtle matcha flavours. The texture, style and flavour will have appeal for anyone who knows and understands the Japanese palette. So i can see why others have felt let down by the 'cheese-cake' experience. Also i thought the cake was certainly overpriced. Although I'm glad to have a place like UT around, i don't see myself becoming a regular unless the price is adjusted."}
{"text":"Not life changing but good cheesecake. I liked the fluffy cheesey souffle esque concept but the line was ultimately not worth it.
Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"I was one of the suckers lining up for an hour and a half to try their cheesecake (I was totally fooled by the long lineup waiting outside). I thought to myself, so many people can't be wrong....! Well... after finally getting a hold on one and trying the cake, I was not mind-blown.

Whereas the cheesecake is indeed fluffier and less sweet than the varieties found at other Japanese stores or T&T Supermarket, it is not worth the 1.5 hour wait. I would swing by to buy another cheesecake if I happen to walk by one day and discover there is no lineup outside, but would not line up for hours again. 

As an interesting note, not long after trying the cheesecake from their Bay street location, I traveled to Malaysia where I happened to find another Uncle Tetsu shop inside a mall. No lineups whatsoever, I bought another cheesecake within 3 minutes and tasted exactly the same as the one from Toronto. So at least the quality is consistent, but not worth hours lined-up."}
{"text":"Didn't taste bad, just reminded me more of sponge cake than a cheesecake"}
{"text":"Yes.  The lines are ridiculous.  
Yes.  The hype is horrendous. 
YES. The cheesecake is fluffy and nothing like an American cheesecake. 

BUT THAT's THE POINT, people!

Listen.

A Japanese cheesecake is SUPPOSED to be light and fluffy like a souffle.  It's from the beaten egg white meringue. 

For all of you complaining about the 2 cheesecake limit, can you *really* eat two by yourself?  If you're having a party, get your two cakes, and portion control, folks. The price is also quite reasonable, because no, you're not eating the whole thing yourself. 

I've been eating these kinds of cheesecakes for years in Asia, and all over the world in Asian bakeries, and this is how they're supposed to be.  Smooth and creamy, light and fluffy.  For everyone complaining about them not having flavor, or not being sweet enough may need to revisit their diet, because it is clearly too laden with sodium and junk for you not to understand the beauty of something so delicate and well-made. 

Enough said."}
{"text":"I did not have to wait a second for this hyped up cheesecake.  Even then, the taste wasn't worth waiting more than 5 minutes for.  I'm glad I didn't wait in line to get a taste, but some people have very different taste than I do."}
{"text":"Went: 7:20 pm Sun May 3 2015 (7th date, 1st date as a couple)
Ordered: cheesecake
Cost: $10.00
We waited two hours in line for this cheesecake. It was okay. Was it unique and wonderful enough to have waited so long? Not really. If it took 5 mins to get it and if I didn't know about the hype, it would get a 7/10. However, our waiting time will factor into my overall rating.
A man in crutches desperately wanted a cheesecake. I don't know why. I joked to my date that maybe he was trying to impress a date. We had two tickets and only wanted one cheesecake and said we would buy one for him. He was so thankful that he gave us $50 which we rejected. Some older Asian woman thought we were selling our place in line, grabbed the $50 bill and forcibly gave it back to him. At the end of the night, we bought 2 cakes and just wanted the $10 from the man in crutches, but he only had a $20 bill, which we reluctantly accepted. So we got our cheesecake for free and did our good deed for the day.
Bottom line: So the cake was 3.5 Stars. The waiting will make me round it down to 3.0."}
{"text":"I love the taste of this cake and my family does as well! At $10, it's also a great deal. My main recommendation would be to look up off-peak times and aim to pick up a cake during those hours. I've been here twice and each time, waited for under 10 minutes. If I were standing outside for hours on end just to get this, it definitely would not be worth it, but for a short wait, $10, and great tasting cake, I give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"With over 750 reviews this place definitely doesn't need any more attention.  But do have some tips from friends that are frequent customers.  This cheese cake is good if you want a lighter tasting alternative. One thing is for sure, line ups do not correlate with the products sometimes and this happens to be a product not worth lining up for an hour.  Tops 15 minutes which is how long we waited.

The reason for the line is that they sell in batches and with little to no store space for customers to stand...this creates an instant line up and illusion to attract more passing patrons. 

The aroma once you step inside is admittedly very attractive but it's largely from the huge blocks of butter they are melting for their Madeleine, not cheesecake. 

Cheesecake: good but tastes much better overnight. good value for the price ($10 after tax)

Madeleines: delicious! Worth getting considering we waited 15min for the cheesecake anyway but we were advised by our friends to eat this hot and fresh...so we did! Wish we bought a box of these.

Give it a try if you see a short line, otherwise..really not worth it."}
{"text":"I walked pass this place three times while working during the day and there was always a lineup of about 30-40 people. After going for a late dinner, we walked past here and there was only about 10 people in line (9:40pm) so we decided to line up.

After a half hour wait, we finally got our cheesecake and were about to see if the wait was worth it. So...the cheesecake was fluffy, hot, and tasty. But I would have a hard time waiting for it during the day when the lines are four times as long.

I can say I tasted the cheesecake and was very satisfied, but that was the last time I will wait for it. That being said, it is one of the better cheesecakes I have tried."}
{"text":"These cheesecakes are amazing!! Every time I am downtown I have to stop by for a cheesecake. My favourite is the original, you can smell it from a block away. Despite how hectic it can get, the staff is always very nice and friendly. If you haven't tried these cheesecakes you are missing out. Trust me the crazy lineups are worth it."}
{"text":"Consistently perfect desserts that are not only visually flawless but also amazing in taste. There's a reason there is constant lineup and this is the reason! I have never had a cheesecake this good."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service. There was an hour wait line up outside the store and the owner abruptly came out 10 mins before closing and rudely / unapologetically telling us they're out of cakes and we'd be painfully waiting outside overnight until tomorrow AM. She handed out business cards but telling us they don't take orders whatsoever. 

If your running out of cakes, why can't you tell us earlier or have an earlier cutoff time? Don't have people wait an hour and tell them very last minute to give up.

Also if your not gonna take orders why bother giving us business cards?

With that attitude, ain't bother coming back again."}
{"text":"The cheesecake was good. The employees were friendly and thanked me for my patience in line which is a nice touch. For the cheesecake though, it is definitely something you should try but I don't think I'd wait in that type of line again. Although I only waited an hour, it's still a long time to wait for an okay cheesecake. It's different and I think that's where all the hype is. The texture is fluffy like a sponge cake and has mild taste of cheesecake. I actually enjoyed the cake more when it was chilled."}
{"text":"Delicious and definitely worth the wait. The cheesecake is light and more similar to a quiche. I would love to try the matcha cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Was crazy enough to wait 2.5 hours for the cake and madelines, but I was very satisfied and I'd say hype validated!

The Cheesecake + Madelines (4.5/5): The Madelines were delicious right out of the oven. Firm surface texture and a very soft center, I couldn't be happier eating them as soon as I got them in my hands. I can't give an account of what they would taste like after sitting for awhile because all 4 were gone before my boyfriend and I got on the streetcar to go home lol. NOW THE CHEESECAKE - I prefer to have cheescake cold, so I did not eat this right away despite spending hours in line for it. Went home, put it in the fridge for awhile and then ate my fair share. Then I ate even more, and more after that. UGH SO GOOD. Its a really light version of new york cheesecake. It's got the cheesy taste, but with an airy texture. It's not sweet at all, more of a hint of sweetness, just satisfying. Let's just say, I'd stand in line again the next time I have the time lol.

The cost (4/5): I have no complaints. $2.99 for madelines and its buy 3 get 1 free and $10 for the cheesecake. Unfortunately, it a limit of 1 cheesecake per person... but that's just cause they are so popular. Fortunately, my boyfriend was there to buy another one so we ended up with two cheesecakes anyways ^__^

The service (3/5): They try. They are trying so hard to keep smiling and keep impatient guests happy in line. I swear they are working from dusk to dawn and I applaud them for it. Would be great if they had more ovens to cook more cheesecakes at one time, because it is unfortunate to wait soooo long ): I'm a fairly patient person, especially for food, but is a LONG WAIT if you don't come before opening ehh."}
{"text":"Love the matcha latte! It's not too sweet, with a strong green tea flavour. A nice warm drink in the chilly winter!"}
{"text":"Decent cheesecake and a unique texture. Worth waiting in line for an hour? I think not."}
{"text":"Uncle Tetsu opened another store right beside the original store. There was a long line up as usually at the original Uncle Tetsu. We were not going to wait in line, seriously, it's been 3 months and the line has not died down. Well, instead, we went next door to Matcha Cafe as there were no line to see what they are selling. It is still a soft opening as they don't have everything on the menu ready. Currently, only selling soft served ice cream and matcha madeleine. The matcha cheesecake won't be available until August.

I got the matcha soft served ice cream in a cup ($3.99). Honestly, didn't really have much matcha taste at all. I have had better matcha ice cream elsewhere. Not worth the $4. My friend got the mixed matcha & vanilla ice cream and she said the vanilla is overpowering the matcha. On the other hand, I also grabbed a matcha red bean madeleine ($2.22) to try. That was actually much better, it was still a bit warm, cake was fresh, a little crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. I got it with red bean in the middle so there was something to chew with. I would come back for more madeleines but it is not cheap.

At least now I have tried a Uncle Tetsu, didn't wait in line for now but I can imagine when they start selling the matcha cheesecake, there will be a secondary line for cheesecake."}
{"text":"My sister lives in downtown and she always told me this bakery has the longest line ever with their delicious cheesecake. So my sister and I decided to wait in line and try it for the first time, the cake was good but actually nothing really special, it really doesn't worth the wait."}
{"text":"The cutest place ever! Even if I didn't love the cute outfits worn by the servers, the music or just the heavenly smell, this place would still be life changing. 

We had the red bean cheesecake and the strawberry angel cake. Both were so delicious, the cheesecake was dense and sweet but not cloying. The angel cake was light and fluffy and just perfect. The name is perfect. 

We also had a coffee and it ended up being just over $15, which I think is awesome for such a lovely experience."}
{"text":"Worst cake I have ever ate , the owner said that all debit machines are broken ?! Seriously? This is just their techniqhe to pay less taxes !! She also said japanese have high standard so they have to throw a lot of craked cake ?! Thats why there is such a long line ? Thats not true . The cake i got is craked so are my friends! Taste is bad too . They just use hunger selling technique to fool average customers ."}
{"text":"Followed the huge hype of this store and decided to try it out because I saw that the line was about 10-15min long as opposed to their regular 1-2 hour lines. Prices are a little over average. Cheesecake is very unorthodox in a very good way, fluffy, warm, perfectly sweet. Very good but I'm not sure if it would be worth a 1-2 hour wait."}
{"text":"I've had the matcha and regular cheesecake. The matcha really had flavour. The cheesecake melded with matcha really works. But the normal cheesecake? I do like the tubby face in the middle of the cake, but that kind of novelty only accomplishes so much.   It tastes rather bland. I really don't get why people are lining up for this place."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the wait but worth a visit if you've never had Japanese cheesecake before."}
{"text":"We were here on a Tuesday afternoon last week, probably around 2:00pm, walked by and see less than 10 ppl in line, so we decided to give it a try and wait in line.  It wasn't a long wait, about 15 to 20 mins, and then we got our first Uncle Tetsu cheesecake, we also went over to the matcha cafe, this shop does not have a line, got the matcha cheesecake with red bean, and matcha madeline as well.  Also, tried their matcha soft serve (which they call it soft cream), it was nicely done, you can really taste the matcha in it.  Shop is really hot inside and small for both shops.  

Back to the cheesecake, the regular cheesecake which is light and fluffy, it was OK, however it wasn't like \"wow I gotta line up 2 hrs for it.\"  Maybe because I can bake my own Japanese style cheesecake to my own liking and I don't need to line up for it.  But I am pretty sure if anyone who can bake a Japanese style cheesecake, won't find it all crazily amused.  Maybe the ones in Japan would probably taste much better. As for the matcha cheesecake and madeline, I gotta say it tasted better than the regular cheesecake.  

All in all, if you haven't try it yet, you might wanna go on a day and time that doesn't have a long line, since I personally don't think is worth to wait for an hour or two."}
{"text":"I often walk by here, but I never buy the cheese cake because I always see long line up, don't wanna wait. Well i already try it before in Asia. After 2 years since it opened, I finally walk in here and try because there wasn't any line up on a Friday night around 9:45ish. I was the 6th in line and there were like 18 ppl in total approximately. However I had to wait for 35mins in line to buy it. It is $10cad for a whole cake which the size of the cake is not that big. Only allow one customer per cake. I do recommend try to go after the rush hours and not to go during winter condition with extreme cold weather e.g -10 and below because you might end up lining up outside unless you don't feel cold.  The cake taste not so sweet which is perfect for people like doesn't like extreme sweet taste. I can taste the cheese within the cake. It is better to eat it fresh and the cake of the portion can serve 2 to 3 people max depends how hungry you are. 
I do recommend to go try it out if you walk by."}
{"text":"I loved this place the cheese cake is very different then what most of us are use to. However you are only allowed to by one person and they are very slow I feel like they are under staffed."}
{"text":"Their honey madeleines was the perfect sweetness and their cheesecake was soft and delicious"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about. Very eggy. Very spongy. I went in with an open mind, expecting that it wouldn't be anything like what I think of as cheesecake. I was right about that. But it shouldn't be called a cheesecake at all. It's like a dense sponge cake with eggs."}
{"text":"The cheesecake, eaten after refrigeration in this case, was subtle, fluffy, easily digestable, moderatly flavorful.  Not fabulous, not horrible.  Definitely a mark of insanity to wait a long time on the sidewalk for this more than once or twice.  As cheesecake--which is, as I remember it, a New York invention--it's a very far cry from, say, the Carnegie Deli (which is High Nirvana) or even President's Choice cheesecake at Loblaws, which, ornamented with a little topping, is pretty damn good.  Uncle Tetsu gets, maybe, a C or a C+."}
{"text":"My friend waited in line on Saturday and gave me 1/4 of the cake on Monday. So just a disclaimer that I didn't eat it fresh. 

It tasted like a creamy spongecake. Not bad, but I wouldn't wait in line for an hr for it."}
{"text":"Good cheesecake but not worth waiting an hour for. Cheesecake is fluffy and light. If you like the really sugary kind this won't be for you."}
{"text":"If you want to try a piece of heaven and put it in your mouth, this is the place. There will be a long line and you can only purchase 1 cheesecake per person. Bring another person with you so you can buy 2 and keep both to yourself. You can keep the cheesecake overnight in the fridge and it still taste like heaven. Uncle Tetsu cheesecake is definitely one of Japan's best creation, aside from Nintendo and Toyota."}
{"text":"I lined up for less than 15 minutes, and apparently based on what I've been told, there's no rhyme or reason when the best time was. So I got lucky. I bought the original cheesecake, and the honey madelines. This review was based on the fact that I've had Japanese cheesecake before, and French madelines.

I liked New York Cheesecake, and I knew Japanese cheesecake was different. I liked each for what it was, and I think it would have been unfair to judge Uncle Tetsu's because Japanese cheesecake was different to NY cheesecake. I went to Uncle Tetsu's to review their Japanese cheesecake and other items.

That said, their original Japanese cheesecake was yummy!!! For $10, worth it. For future, I would not wait more than 10-15 minutes, but it depended how badly I craved it. At that moment, I wasn't aware of anywhere else that sold Japanese cheesecake (although since then I realised there's one other store); so, I am giving it 4 stars based on the cake, how they genuinely tried to be efficient in getting a cake in your hands (it wasn't their fault so many people came!), and location (easily accessible, near Eaton Centre). I took it home to share with my family, and everyone agreed how delicious it was.

I enjoyed the madelines for what it was, but I wouldn't buy them again. They were yummy but they tasted like similar to a honeyed sponge cake to me?

I took one star away because although they tried to make it easier to sell their items by opening multiple alternate locations, they are still pretty close to each other (i.e. the one next door!?). I've been told they have a location around Union Station but I have not checked it out on whether it's the same thing. For me, it would have made more sense to open another Uncle Tetsu further away, perhaps more north?"}
{"text":"OMG I love their cheesecake. I am a person who loves cakes but I've always hated cheesecakes. But just a after a single bite, I couldn't resist eating more of uncle tetsu's cheesecake. Do expect a lineup sometimes a long lineup but I guess it's worth the wait.
Highly recommend to try some!"}
{"text":"The line-up time tells you the cheesecake is not something extraordinary.  It's just a hype
It will just another hype like bubble-tea, cup cakes,and ramen.  

I had many cheesecakes before.   I think most of the people would compare this with others.  Please don't.  I would say the taste is very forgettable.  It's not something you never tasted before.  
it's the texture and the moist itself make it standout

As you can see the line is getting shorter, it implies the customers are just curious about the cake but not something you MUST have every day. It's not something you will buy again and again.

The servers are very friendly.  They won't crack a smile. Feel sorry for them because they have to work long hours and non-stop."}
{"text":"After all the crazy hype and social media postings of hour long line-ups, I decided to try Uncle Tetsu's a couple of years after they've opened.

I purchased the Honey Madeline's (buy 3 get 1 free) and also purchased 1 Uncle Tetsu's Cheesecake.

The Honey Madeline's were a disappointment for me. There's nothing particular wrong with it per say - I just found it quite bland and lack of moisture. It's definitely edible... but just not something I would ever wait in line for (even though it was only a 5 minute line up).

The Cheesecake was quite delicious. Moisture was perfect and the taste was light and not overpowering. You can leave the cheesecake out without refrigeration for 24-36 hours and I would strongly suggest you do that, rather than put it in the fridge. ONCE you put it in the fridge, it will not return to it's natural softness/moisture.

I would get the cheesecake again for the $9.00. I would pass on the Madeline's... even if they were free.

The experience of lining up and watching them make/back and package the cakes were a mini experience in itself. If you have some time on your hands and happen to walk by when there isn't a 30 minute lineup... it's quite a good adventure."}
{"text":"It's just regular cheesecake, not special. Not too dry, not too sweet.
But definitely not worth lining up more than 5 minutes for."}
{"text":"Still with a sprawling line at Uncle Tetsu, it was no surprise to see this Matcha Cafe pop up right beside the original to offset demand. As the name entails, this cafe serves all things matcha from soft serve to madeleines. The madeleines, which are $2.99 each or buy three, get one free, have a subtle green tea matcha aroma and flavour with a nice crust. There wasn't a line in the afternoon today for the cafe but that can change in the blink of an eye especially with the ever popular cheesecake getting its own matcha version in August."}
{"text":"This place has been opened for a few months (or more?) now but I always, always see a line up. I knew nothing about Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake and was wondering what was the hype. We were in the area yesterday and in need for sweet dessert so we thought eh, why not. There were only a few people in line and we had a bit of time ahead of us. Here's my review:

Cons (because I could only see cons at first)
- We waited 35 MINUTES. Had we known, we would not have lined up. I think we caught them at a bad time. It was Sunday at 7 pm and only a few people working in the shop, and they constantly had a backlog of orders. We waited 20 min outside then finally got inside to the cashier, and as we order she tells us \"it's going to be 12 minutes for the next batch of cheesecakes\". Oh damnit. 
- Considering there is CONSTANTLY a line up, I think they should organize it better, or move to a bigger location since they're so popular. Spending the time waiting was one thing, waiting in -10 degrees weather was even worst. I was frozen when we finally got in.

Pros
- Oh my god. Guys. I had no clue what I was getting. The funny part? I DON'T EVEN LIKE CHEESECAKE. It's always too much for me. But this? THIS is the real deal. So good. So fluffy. So yummy. My boyfriend and I ate the entire cake in one sitting.
- The price! Only $10 for the whole cheesecake. And they're so popular you'd think they'd up the price. I was happily surprised!
- We also got a madeleine that was pretty decent, so ++ for that.

All in all, if the line was not so long, I'd definitely be a regular customer, because I think I just discovered my favorite dessert in Toronto. But I'll only come back on a warm sunny day when I have time to kill, because 35 minutes was a bit much."}
{"text":"Are people still lining up for the cheesecake? I did once, and that has more than satisfied my curiosity. The \"regular\" cheesecake will taste more like a sponge cake to non-Asian cheesecake afficionados; the madelines are nothing remarkable. 
I had the chance to taste the green tea /matcha version of the madelines and soft serve ice cream few months back and would definitely recommend them over the  \"original\" cheesecake and madelines."}
{"text":"My hotel is cross the street from Uncle Tetsu, which made it easy for me to try it without waiting. I went in at 10am on a weekday and got my cheesecake within 2 minutes. 
Both my husband and I enjoyed the cheesecake and mocha latte. The fresh and hot cheesecake, while not too sweet is by far our favorite! 
I recommend trying to come here on weekday working hours if you can."}
{"text":"Was on my way to another bakery when I came across this newly opened Japanese bakery. It's a drop in and pick up kind of place, no seating available. Tried a free sample of their japanese cheesecake and I was hooked. The texture is like a sponge cake but just a tad more dense with a hint of cheesecake flavour. Not too sweet, just the way I like it!  Also tried their cheesecake cookie - tasted a little sweeter but was just like their cheesecake but in cookie format! Definitely will be back for more cake in the future."}
{"text":"First time going to Uncle Testsu's and I am pleased! Not a long wait at all. Only took about half an hour to get a fresh and hot Japanese style cheesecake. Definitely suggest trying it out! I suggest putting it in the fridge for an hour if you are a true cheese cake lover, really brings out the taste."}
{"text":"The original cheesecake is delicious with a lightly sweetened cream cheese flavour and a soft fluffy texture. It's interesting to see the cakes and madeleines freshly made while in line, but it can get very warm waiting inside the shop. At $10 it's not overly expensive, but its overall value to you might depend on how long you waited!

If you're looking to minimize your wait time, I walk through the area a lot and have noticed that:
Mornings - usually no line up
Afternoons - generally a short or medium length line up (~20 mins or more)
Evenings & Weekends - usually much busier with a long line up (~45 mins or more)
Please note, these are some observations for a regular week and things may be different when you visit.

I've gone back for multiple cheesecakes, but only if there's no line!"}
{"text":"I noticed the lack of lineup on a Sunday around noon-1pm and walked in. I waited maybe 5 minutes for the 5 people in front to be served, and another batch came out while I waited.

I got the cheesecake and 4 of the madelines. I liked them both. They both have an egg flavour which was light and good. And yea, the texture is nice too. The taste is not overwhelming or sweet but both items left me satisfied - maybe thats the eggs. 

The cheesecake had some flavour but the texture was very smooth. I couldn't really eat a lot of it though, maybe I could with a cup of tea. 

I also like that the price is good and that they round off to nice round numbers. I would go again, but only if the line wasn't out the door."}
{"text":"The cheese cakes were so delicious and the prices were reasonable. I like their tart, too. They are so tasty. I still come back there whenever I am in the area. Uncle Tetsu's cheese cake is now a part of my life."}
{"text":"I'd give it 3 1/2 stars. Reason why it's always packed is because they only bake 12 at a time. The first time I tasted the cake, it was very bland, however, it really grows on you and you'll start to really taste the subtle flavors (it actually tastes like cheese). Plus it doesn't feel too heavy unlike a traditional cheesecake, but that doesn't mean it's healthy. Pretty sure a lot of butter and eggs go into making this. Overall I like the place, and I guess I didn't mind waiting almost 2 hours outside at night. Not so much into the muffins. Can't wait for the new desserts."}
{"text":"We tried their signature fresh-made cheescake, nothing too special. It felt more like eating raw cake batter that left the mouth with a bad sour taste. They only serve it in one fairly big size which is too much for even two people. I have to tell though, it tasted better the next day."}
{"text":"Good But Overhyped

After seeing consistently long lineups and television news stories about Uncle Tetsu's restaurant, I was excited to be able to finally try out one of his cheesecakes. My opportunity came when I happened to pass by the York Go Train Concourse at Union Station. To my surprise, Uncle Tetsu's has a newly opened branch shop set up in the waiting lobby with a very short lineup. When I took my first bite out of that cheesecake, I thought it was good, but I wasn't exactly impressed. Don't get me wrong, the cheesecake is delicious, but not great is what I'm trying to say.

I have to mention that the cheesecake being served is not the traditional western style cheesecake you will be accustomed to, it is a Japanese style cotton cheesecake. The cheesecake has a very soft and fluffy consistency which is comparable to a sponge cake. I would describe the cake as being more of a cheese flavoured sponge cake rather than as a creamy western style cheesecake. The cake does however strikes a great balance of sweetness without being too sweet or too bland, but just the right amount.

Considering the news hype, long lineups at the Coach Terminal location, and hefty price, I think Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake is overhyped. The cheesecake is good, but in my opinion, not worth waiting in line for 30min-1hr wait or the hefty $10 price tag for a small 2 person dessert serving size. 

On a side note, everyone has their own opinion, so if you've never tried out Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake before, I would recommend trying it out once to see if you like it or not. My tip would be to try it out the at the Union Station location where there is a significantly shorter lineup."}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough where my friends lined up on our behalf and got us some cakes so that took away the frustrations of waiting in line to get a piece of cake! 

In terms of packaging, the cake as seen in numerous (or many to be accurate) Facebook posts everywhere on the internet, they are nicely packaged and the uncle tetsu stamp on top is very adorable. 

In terms of flavour, I dont think it's worth the wait. It taste like those $1 sponge cakes that you can get from the Chinese supermarket (a bit more fluffier) with some cream cheese flavour infused into it. It's very light, not too rich, as expected from Japanese desserts. I would buy it again and again if it's on the way and without lineup. But if i had to line up for 30min plus for it, I think you and I could do without it. 

Also, their mini cupcakes, do not get them, they are very dry and not good or special at all."}
{"text":"This offshoot of the insanely popular Uncle Tetsu franchise recently opened beside their store which specializes in Japanese cheesecakes.  This new store specializes in all things matcha - soft serve, shaved ice, cold pressed green tea, green tea madeleines, and of course a green tea version of their Japanese cheesecake.

I walked by the store today after lunch, and seeing no line I decided to go in and check it out.  I think they are running a soft open because the only products they currently have available are their green tea soft serve and their green tea madeleines.

The green tea soft serve was $3.99 and could be served in a cone or a cup.  It tastes pretty much the same as your run-of-the-mill green tea ice cream, but it also melts very quickly.

The madeleines have a nice crunchy exterior with a soft and fluffy interior.  The green tea flavour isn't too strong; while it was quite tasty - I don't think it's worth $2.22 each (although they are currently running a promotion of buy 3 madelines and get 1 free).

I probably won't have the soft serve or the madeleines again, but I would want to try their green tea cheesecake once it is available."}
{"text":"If I had relied solely on the Yelp reviews, I probably would have skipped this place. Good thing I didn't. For those who actually know what Japanese cheesecake is, Uncle Tetsu does it right and does it exceptionally well."}
{"text":"Okay everyone don't believe the hype. 
These cake are not worth  the wait.if your waiting more then 5 minutes  leave. 
We tried it and it was okay 2 out of 5 that's it they are over priced. 
A week later I went to the Brust supermarket in Mississauga and they have same baked daily for $5.99 that's $2.00 cheaper no wait I am sure these can be found else where in Toronto.  We liked the one from the supermarket."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the cheesecake as my brother brought it back from Toronto to share with me. He told me he had to wait 45 minutes in line for it and there was only a limit of 1 per customer. The cheesecake itself was a lot smaller than what I had imagined but for $10 I guess you can't expect too much. The texture was soft, fluffy and moist. It was slightly sweet with excellent cream cheese flavor. It's probably the best version of Japanese cheesecake I've tasted before. Since it's so light and fluffy, it easy to eat a lot! I mean I could probably consume half of it myself - easily."}
{"text":"They are known for their cheesecake. Although the wait was terrible, it totally worth for the wait. I went there in the afternoon, and the wait was about an hour. The cheesecake is so delight, not too sweet, and taste really good regardless if it's warm or cold."}
{"text":"I saw the hype - the news articles, social media recommendations, reviews - and bought into it. 

When you enter the store, it smells absolutely glorious. And like all popular things, there was a very long lineup of people waiting for what was being offered. After waiting for nearly an hour, I finally ordered and got my cheesecake and madeleines. The madeleines were okay and the cheesecake was not up to expectations. While hot, the cheesecake had a great texture to it - very fluffy and airy. However, in terms of taste it was very light (a little too light) and lacked sweetness. I put the cheesecake in the fridge overnight and it was a little bit better the next day - a little more dense texture wise and slightly better tasting. Still, not what I was expecting or hoping for. 

If you want to try something new, I say go for it. However, if you're looking for something mind blowingly different and good, I'd say you're better off looking elsewhere. But of course, my experience is subjective, so maybe it's best to find out yourself."}
{"text":"Dropped by here really quick since my friend and I were feeling a little pekish after dinner.  We had their honey madeline which was alright.  We got 2 which cost $5 and in all honesty, it wasn't worth the price.  It was nice and warm, and yes it did taste good but nothing extraordinary.  I would however love to try their matcha madeline one day, if ever I'm in the area again.  3/5."}
{"text":"This review is for the cheesecake only. I did not go into the cafe.
Reading some of these reviews, it sounds like I got lucky at the time I walked in. It was mid afternoon on Wednesday, and there was zero line-up. I just walked straight to the counter, ordered a single cheesecake and two madelines, and walked out. Was less than a minute!
Anyway, the cheesecake is good, but honestly it's nothing to write home about. I love cheesecake, and perhaps the fact that this Japanese version is missing the crust makes it less appealing to me. For $10, the value is ok, but as others have said, it is much lighter and more airy. You can easily eat 1/4 of the cake in one serving, as opposed to a usual thin slice of your average dense creamy cheesecake. So realistically, it doesn't serve as many people and therefore the value isn't actually as good."}
{"text":"In short (some people write novellas disguised as reviews): cheesecake is nice, but not worth any wait (only got it because lineup was super short). The madeline is super boring and tastes like cornmeal. Yay fluffy cheesecake..."}
{"text":"After waiting almost one full hour in the sweltering heat (first outside, then inside the bakery) for Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake, I was crazing a frozen treat, so I hopped next door to Uncle Tetsu's Matcha Cafe for the matcha soft serve.

I ordered the matcha and milk twist in a cone. I thought the serving that I received was reasonable for the price, but it seems as though there can be quite a bit of variability in this, as I saw others leave with far fewer/skinnier swirls. In terms of the flavour, the matcha flavour was quite nice, although it could have been just a bit stronger. The earthiness of the matcha was nicely balanced by the sweetness of the milk flavour, which is reminiscent of Momofuku's Cereal Milk soft serve (as another reviewer already noted.) What I didn't enjoy so much, unfortunately, was the texture of the soft serve - icy instead of creamy-smooth. As a result of the iciness, the ice cream (ice milk maybe?) melted quite quickly, which compromised the integrity of the cone (i.e., made it soggy), which came very close to resulting in a ruined white t-shirt (drips!)

Overall an average matcha soft serve ice cream experience."}
{"text":"It's basically a lighter and fluffy version of cheesecake. It's not too sweet, which I love. Try to go early in the morning so the line is not as crazy."}
{"text":"Tried to buy a cheesecake today.  Waited 10 minutes with only 7 people in front of me and they served maybe two people in that time.  I don't know what is going on here, but the customer service is bad - very bad."}
{"text":"It was an extremely nice day and the wait time was about 1 hour long which was not bad for a Saturday afternoon. 

They currently have two products and there is a limit of 1 cheesecake ($10) and 4 madelines (buy 3 get 1 free- $2.33 each) per person. CASH ONLY. 

They also have wifi in the store to make the wait more bearable! 

The cheesecake is the original flavour but has the softest and fluffiest texture ever. It is a hybrid of a sponge cake and a cheesecake and totally melts in your mouth. It isn't heavy either and is extremely airy and light. Their cheesecakes are an asian take to the traditional cheesecake. 

The madelines have a stronger, more flavourful and buttery taste."}
{"text":"Waited in line for an hour and a half.  Only had the original and madeleines. Came out fresh and hot.  Ate it whole cake in 2 minutes.  Delicious? yes.  Would I wait 45 minutes or longer for it? No.  Can't go wrong for 10 bucks for a cake though.  Don't think it was meant to be eaten right away.  When still warm, tasted like tamago from a good sushi restaurant.  I ate some of my friend's cake after it cooled and it tasted like a light, and fluffy cheesecake. I'd probably return when the hype dies down.  They also have free wifi. It was cash only when I went."}
{"text":"This review is probably quite biased because the line was miraculously non-existent when we showed up on a whim on a Monday noon. The cheesecake I personally found was absolutely delicious, but then I'm a fan of lighter and fluffier cakes like this one.

I think I would wait a maximum of around 30 minutes in the cold, if it came to that."}
{"text":"I've tried the following:
1. Original Cheesecake
2. Original madeleines 
3. Green tea madeleines

Original Cheesecake
Lots of chinese bakeries in Scarborough make a japanese cheesecake, Uncle Tetsu's really doesn't taste that different. It's nice and fluffy, a different texture than some of the chinese bakery ones? But it's really nothing special.

Original madeleines
I thought the ones I got were kinda dry, I really wouldn't recommend wasting money on buy these.

Green tea madeleines
The ones I tried had a good green tea flavour and I felt they were more moist. You have to buy these at their green tea cafe next door. If there isn't a line, go for it. If there is a line, forget it. I wouldn't wait 45 min for this."}
{"text":"Too overrated I should say. Wait is forever for a Japanese cheesecake and madeleine cake. For those who like green tea flavor may like the cheese cake."}
{"text":"The wait was pleasant - there's not a nicer group of people in the world to stand around waiting and anticipating something than a group of Canadians: lots of chatter and laughter ensued during my 50-minute wait. I've experienced this waiting to buy thermal underwear before a CFL Grey Cup game in Regina, and the experience outside Uncle Tetsu's in Toronto had a similar celebratory and excited feel. 

Similar to a CFL Grey Cup game, however, the final product for which we were so excited turned out a bit more bland than we'd wanted. It's not that the cheesecake here isn't of high quality - it is good - it's just not the New York style cheesecake, or the \"Mamma's Little Bakery in Chicago\" experience (The Friends reference was too tempting not to use).  

The \"Conditional Pass\" from the Toronto Health Department was a bit concerning, I admit, but considering the food doesn't remain in the store more than 5 minutes after being removed from the oven, I don't know if it's too damning."}
{"text":"My BF bought me an original cake yesterday and I was so excited since I've only had this cake once before in China and it was really good. I was kinda hungry so I ate the entire cake within 20 - 30min. After one to two hours I started to feel really sick that I threw up twice last night and had serious diarrhea. Beside the cake, I only had some pasta for lunch so I'm pretty sure it was the cake causing me sick. I know the review for the cake is really good but I hope this won't happen on anyone else."}
{"text":"Love the flavour and texture of Japanese cheesecake  it's hard not to eat it right on the street while walking away from the shop. The downside is the long line and the limit of one cheesecake per customer."}
{"text":"Came on Saturday morning it was long line up already. 
It is great and yammy japanese cheese cake. 
And price point is very reasonable.

Space inside is too small it is so uncompy.

Anyways worthy to wait and line up!"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of downtown, queues, or cheesecake, but overall a tremendous experience. It's definitely the place to be while your Greyhound bus is idling in the bay next door."}
{"text":"The cheesecake is nothing to be crazy about but if you haven't had it, I'd recommend trying it. It's different from any cheesecake you will eat! 

There are three kinds: original, green tea and angel. I've only had original and angel, they are similar in taste. Angel is softer if anything. 

I personally enjoy their madeleines over their cheesecake. It's smaller and the flavours are somewhat similar. 

In regards to lines, you shouldn't need to wait long. If you always encounter a long line at this location, I recommend going to the one inside Union Station near the Go Train waiting area. There is never a line as long as you are not there during work rush hours. The only thing is I beleive they only serve the original cheesecake."}
{"text":"So I have tried this out a few times now and cannot understand what the whole fuss is about. Yes the tarts and the cheesecakes are good, but not worth standing in line for 20 mins. 

The dessert is high quality though and you can smell the aroma wafting in the air as you enter the establishment....guess builds up the anticipation of the flavor of the cheesecake.....

Overall it's a must try but definitely not a regular choice for me"}
{"text":"A mythical line up
A prodigious cheesecake
An epic journey
A sublime first spoon

Fun fact: I have never made it to inside of the shop
Sad fact: Winter is coming, that line up will be a special mission
Win fact: I tried the cheesecake at a Starbucks as I delivered a convincing argument to a patron that had a Tetsu's on the premises. 
Plus fact: The Matcha shop next to Tetsu's"}
{"text":"It was cold and we didn't want to wait in line for the original cheesecake so we walked into the left half of the store which sells the two other flavours. Bought one green tea and one red bean cheese cake plus Madeleines. They were served warm which is a big factor in their enjoyment. The Madeleines to me tasted better than the cheesecakes. After they cooled it tasted like a sponge cake. Still didn't find where the 'cheese' was. My red bean had a denser filling but definitely these were not half sponge cake and half cheesecake like people say. If I was in the area again I may buy one. I won't drive down for it and definitely wouldn't stand in line for it."}
{"text":"Waited over 2 hours.  There's always a line of people waiting and the service is extremely slow.  It brings out the curiosity in people so I'm thinking it's a business strategy and it's obviously working.  When you finally purchase and taste it, you'll most likely be disappointed because you were expecting heaven.  It's one of those one and done thangs and you probably won't try it again.  I would however choose this over traditional rich and heavy cheesecake."}
{"text":"I have to say yes I am a fan.
It isn't too sweet compare to a regular cheesecake.  
It is light and fluffy with a hit of that familiar cheesecake flavor.
A must try, at least once :) when the line up isn't too bad."}
{"text":"I'm not really a follow-the-hype kind of gal, but I do like dessert. I was across the street when I spied that the line was short. Figuring I might as well take the opportunity, I managed to get my hands on a cheesecake in under 15 minutes. 

Would I wait longer than 15 minutes? Nope. 

It was good, nice and light but I wouldn't say I would at any time crave it. I'd purchase again if I was in similar circumstances... in the neighbourhood, wanting a treat and not a big lineup."}
{"text":"I only had the ice cream here, as the line for the cheesecake was really long and we didn't want the green tea cheesecake.

I found that the ice cream was bland and is quite pricey for $4. It is comparable to the frozen yoghurt at buffets (which isn't that great). The milk flavour tasted better than the green tea. I would not buy the ice cream from here again, but will probably go try the cheesecake one day;"}
{"text":"overrated and not very sweet cheesecake to my gaijen sensibilities. Maybe it's good for asians that don't care for sweet desserts. I showed up around 6PM on a Saturday and waited for 30 min.

I think people complaining about line and one cake limit fail to realize that this is part of the cachet. It's somewhat exclusive. You have to earn it."}
{"text":"I think Uncle Tetsu is the one and only place in Toronto that really pulls strings in different directions. Some people love it, some people hate it, there isn't really a happy medium.

For me, I love this place.

Here's a pro tip, if you've never had Japanese cheesecake, I might suggest getting the one at T&T so you aren't waiting in line for a hour+ just to be disappointed. Japanese cheesecake is very different than what we're used to. I'm not saying to put T&T's Japanese cheesecake on a great big pedestal, because it's only so-so. What I'm saying is to get a rough idea of how different Japanese cheesecake is. 

For me, I personally love Uncle Tetsu, and it was worth the wait the 3 times I've been here. I firmly believe in this place, and I believe they also opened a dessert shop not too far, but unfortunately for me, it's all matcha. I don't like matcha.

I believe this place can soar and soar more than it already has, for me it was worth the hype and it'll always be worth it. The 3rd time I had waited in line, it was pouring down rain and I didn't have an umbrella. But it was so worth it.

The best way to describe Japanese Cheesecake, is that it's half pound cake, half cheesecake. It's like ... Extremely fluffy bread, with cheesecake. I can't really pin point it.

I've had a lot of Japanese cheesecake in my day, and Uncle Tetsu has set the bar. It's untouchable. It's super fresh when you purchase it, just steaming in the box right off the bat. 

Here's my issue with some of the reviews on here about Uncle Tetsu. They don't know what to expect from a Jap chessecake, and immediately rate it down low because it's not as rich and SWEET as we're used to. And it's a damn shame, because of the sheer art and care that is put into these cheesecakes break my heart. 

No, Japanese cheesecake is NOT meant to be super sweet, and it's NOT meant to be rich.

Uncle Tetsu would be a perfect place to start if you've never had Japanese cheeecake, but the line would say other wise.

I feel I would be directing my review more to those who have had Jap cheesecake. Otherwise ... You might be disappointed, or maybe not?

TIP: Ignore the rude people who walk by and make comments like, \"Wow ... Waiting in line JUST for cheesecake?\" or \"It's not even that good! Save your money!\" Angers me to no end.

Uncle Tetsu will always be that one place I will repeatedly speak very highly about. Because they deserve every single inch of success they are recieving."}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to have a good friend buy it for us to try; he waited in the line for approx. 1.5h. Don't get me wrong, it is better than the Asian supermarket version, but this cheesecake is definitely over-hyped! It is not worth the wait in my opinion. He also bought the madeleines which is comparable to regular T&T supermarket coconut tarts (or whatever they are called) for more than half the price."}
{"text":"Holy wait times, Batman!

The infamy of the wait lines now precedes Uncle Tetsu's famed cheesecakes.  I arrived at 5:15pm and proceeded to wait patiently for 2.5+ hours. And by \"patiently\", I really mean I was too frozen cold to emote or move. So after experiencing the bajillion year wait myself, I'll now cut to the chase: Was it worth it?

Yes, worth it for the price, but not worth it for the ridiculously long wait times.

The cheesecake is a fantastic value for the quality.  It tastes like a mix between a sponge cake and an egg custard tart, but much fluffier in texture, creamier by nature, with an aftertaste of cream cheese. Not super sweet, not quite milky-type creamy, just pillow softness.  Essentially, if you've ever eaten an egg tart, you already know this taste.

Additional info: 
- Accepting cash only! How awful would it be to line up for hours only to find out you can't actually have any cake?  
- A flat $10 buys you a 6\" original flavour cheesecake (no other flavours are available in Toronto yet)
- Watch out for the line point where you block the mini alley - cars really do back out of there and it's a rather scary spot
- You can only buy one cheesecake per person, but you can buy Madeleines on top of it (to a maximum of 8 Madeleine pieces)"}
{"text":"Really amazing cheesecake, and wroth the 2.5 hour wait in line. Try it if you have 2.5 hours to spare, and bring $10 exact in cash."}
{"text":"I went around 7pm on a wed night. About 5 people on queue ahead of me but service was fast and i was out in less than 5 mins. I got the madeleines and cheesecake. Cheesecake fluffy and soft like the ones i ate in japan. Madeleines are okay. Not bad but not so amazing."}
{"text":"Okay. Worth the hype! 

My friends and I came here before watching a show and decided we'd get a cake to split. after smelling that sweet air air seeing those delicious looking cakes. I decided, I need my OWN to bring home!!!
I've walked by uncle tetsu's quite a bit and each time I did there wA always a line. This time Round we were lucky! 

So I did it and I jumped on the band wagon and took the plunge! Not regretting it AT ALL!! 

I had my first bite at home later with my husband and I wanted to have several more bites after that. The cake is light, airy and cheeses without being overwhelming. The matcha version was great too because it offered that bitter kick that I love about matcha. 

Overall, I'm all for uncle tetsu's and will be going again!"}
{"text":"I personally like cheesecake when it's cold, so I hated having the line up for the cheese cakes so that they're \"fresh out the oven\". The Madeleines were also quite dry which was disappointing. Overall, I like their cheesecake because they're soft and not too sweet; but was disappointed by their Madeleines."}
{"text":"Honestly a god send ! I saw this girl enjoying a green coloured soft serve (a little too much if you asked me a week ago) and then I decided to go on a hunt for where she acquired such a thing. On a cold windy awful afternoon I finally found it here !! I decided to get myself two Madeleine's with red bean in the middle absolutely amazing but I think I would like them better when they're a day old so they're a bit harder. And the soft serve well I got it two days In a row. My hands were so cold but it was sooooo good. I think you can get it mixed with milk regular flavour but I went all out green matcha. I think it's 3.99 for the cone or cup and Madeleine's are 2.69? If you buy 3 get one free   Also worth noting you don't have to wait outside for an hour for anything there's no line at the matcha cafe compared to the cheesecake line !!! Woot woot"}
{"text":"I've been to uncle tetsu's a few times now and never have I ever been there without a minimum wait time. Is it worth the wait? Maybe not. I do though crave their cheese cake from time to time, hence I've been here a couple of times. 

A few comments about the place:

1. It's a grab and go place.
2. Only cash or debit so go prepared.
3. One cheese cake per person. If you wanted an extra cheese cake you should wait in line again.
4. The cheese cake isn't an ordinary western cheese cake, it's fluffy like your biting a cloud but very fulfilling. It is delicious and if you haven't tried it before it's definitely worth trying.


5. If your waiting in line alone make sure to have ur beats along with a good playlist! 

Enjoy your cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Definitely not worth all the hype. I decided to drop by this place to see what all the fascination was about. I've never tried japanese cheesecake before. Unfortunately, it's texture was certainly not my preference, and I'm not a picky eater. I've tried various asian cheesecakes before, but I just couldn't get myself to take more than 4 bites. It was much more eggy, fluffy, light, and mushier than I expected. After a couple bites, it became a bit too sweet, eggy, and monotonous for my taste buds. I'm not a fan of the texture.

I only waited about 20 minutes during mid-day, and paid $10 flat for the cake. It doesn't come with fork or napkins, and there is absolutely no seating inside the restaurant. I am terribly glad I didn't come to this place earlier when it first opened and endured the 2-3 hour wait. I haven't been back since coming here a few weeks ago, and I probably won't go back unless the line is very short. I'll give it a second chance, but I haven't found myself remotely craving their cheesecake at all."}
{"text":"First of all if you come here, come for the event like atmosphere. It's not all about the cheesecake; friendly peppy staff, numerous tourist trying to get a slice before flying out, and people in tears as the sold out sign has come out.

In terms of cheesecake I would say it's different, not the best I have ever had, but good to try (eggy taste). The Madeleine's were okay, pretty similar to what I can get at Longos. 

Go for it if you have an hour or two kill, otherwise steer clear."}
{"text":"Went to uncle tetsu again on a weekday in the afternoon, ZERO LINE UP! Went inside and picked up a cheesecake right away. The hype is dying down, but the cheesecake is still great!!"}
{"text":"I tried their cheesecake with a friend, who waited in the line for around an hour. 

The taste is average fluffy cake, with overpower eggs flavour. 

I didn't feel it worth the waiting time."}
{"text":"It was really delicious. I got a cheesecake. It's important to note that the cheesecakes are 6 inches in diameter (when the sign on the wall in the store says they are 6 inches on the round. Completely different! Love the size of them.

I'm giving it 3 stars instead of a higher rating because of the stupid \"1 cheesecake per customer rule\", and the store's inability to adapt to its popularity. I waited in line for 40 minutes for a cheesecake. And that's the norm. People are lined up out the door all the time for this store and its terrible. They need to up their production if they're going to match the demand. I've only been once and I'd love to go again, but not until they can start pumping out their product quicker instead of making people line up out in the street."}
{"text":"I always saw this store everytime I'm going to Eaton Center. I came here today to try it out. I bought 3 madelines with red beans but I was charged for the set instead of giving me one free. But overall the madelines with red bean are superb (real green tea taste, moist and delightful to look at) but it is pricey.
I also tried the soft serve green tea ice cream in a cone, all I can say that it's the perfect macha green tea ice cream I ever tasted in my life. It was heavenlicious. The customer service was nice too. They never fail to smile when I came there."}
{"text":"The cheesecake was delicious, the madeleines were good but nothing to write home about. If you're expecting dense, super sweet, extremely creamy cheesecake then you will be disappointed. It is light, airy, not very sweet, and more buttery than creamy.

The madeleines were super buttery and kind of reminded me of a muffin (texture and taste). However, they were a good compliment to the cheesecake.

To Yelp: I really wish there was a way to filter out reviews that are merely people complaining about waiting in line or people who drop their rating down a few stars due to having to line up for 2+ hours. You saw the line before getting in it and I'm pretty sure you knew about the hype before traveling to the store. No one is forcing you to wait in line. You can leave whenever you want. Why factor in your own personal lack of patience into the review of the product/service? I want to be able to click a button that says \"not relevant\" and have the overall rating of the company re-calculate for my own personal use."}
{"text":"So delicious!! Just the right amount of sweetness and fluff! The original cheesecake is the one to get. 

We waited in line for 5 minutes and as soon as you step into the store, you smell the delicious, creamy aroma of the cheesecake baking. Not a place to miss!"}
{"text":"I've tried their cheesecake (4/5), regular madeleines (4/5), matcha madeleines (4.5/5), matcha red bean madeleines (5/5). I would come here just for the matcha red bean madeleines, they are so good. I could honestly eat four in one sitting, which is great since they have a buy three get one free deal on them. Also, there's never much of a line at the matcha cafe so you can just drop by. Don't bother with the matcha soft serve. Watery and bland. Just spend all your money on the matcha red bean madeleines and be happy."}
{"text":"Standing in line for one of Uncle Tetsu's famous cheesecakes has become a rite of passage for many Torontonians, but does this fluffy Japanese dessert live up to the hype?

I just want to preface this review by first pointing out that there are two locations of Uncle Tetsu's shops in Japan, while the remaining 70+ locations are scattered around China and Taiwan.  This isn't to slander their product, but it's so that people know this is mainly a Chinese franchise making Japanese style cakes using a Japanese-centric marketing strategy.  

For a seemingly global franchise, they do not even have any shops in Tokyo (or even on the main island, for crying out loud).  Would Uncle Huang's Japanese Style Cheesecake-ateria sound as delectable? Highly doubtful.  

But if you think you are getting a spongy Japanese style cheesecake like the kind you would find at Fujiya, Cozy Corner, or Vie de France (staple franchises in the world of Japanese baked goods) don't be fooled.  These guys are a Chinese baked goods franchise using the soft cultural power of Japan to sell their cakes.

Now onto the food review.

Uncle Tetsu's Japanese style cheesecakes are delightful, soft treats.  They're a perfect gift to bring to your friend's house, or if you hate yourself you can eat an entire cake by yourself.  The main selling point for this cheesecake is the freshness.  When you get in line for one of their cheesecakes, you'll know that an hour later, when you reach the register, your cheesecake will be fresh from the oven.

The cake itself is OK at best.  While it is very spongy and soft, it does not have enough cream cheese.  It's more like a sponge cake, with some cream cheese accidentally mixed in.  I think this is a big disappointment, as the main ingredients for this style of cheesecake comes down to eggs, butter, cream, sugar, and cream cheese.  I'm not saying it's easier and faster to make the cheese cake yourself but... that's actually what I'm saying.

I would recommend their Madeleines over their cheese cake.  Crispy and golden on the outside, soft and moist on the inside."}
{"text":"Finally made it to the over hyped cheesecake! ....and the verdict is: it's good but not amazing, definitely not worth a hour long line.

The texture of the cake makes it for me- so soft and mushy but I couldn't really taste the cheesecake.
The cake itself Is not too sweet, which is perfect.
It's a fairly small pie & is decently priced at $10. 

Would I go back again- maybe if there's no line."}
{"text":"Fortunate to have a friend who was kind & determined enough to stand inline.....

Taste:3.5/5
Value:3.5/5 (excluding time spent in line)

Willingness to lineup
1-2hrs in line: Sure if my cake comes with a free vaca to Mt Fuji 
Half hr in line: Fine......but only if I ever have a mistress and need to impress her
10 mins in line: perhaps ...only because That is all I need to sip my latte and Yelp abt something

All in all not a bad product, but hope cool heads prevail.

To paraphrase Master Miyagi.....\"Julie-san standing in line no good. But if must stand in line, must be damn good.\""}
{"text":"The cheesecake was amazing coffee and just right it was a little bit of a wait but it was well worth it highly recommend it for anyone not from the Toronto area"}
{"text":"I don't get it.  I heard so much about it, went and got some, shared it with 6 people.  ALL SIX OF US said we'd never eat it again.  I didn't say BUY it again.  Given the calories I allow myself to eat as treats, I can't see why I'd ever spend one calorie on this stuff.

It's largely flavourless but tastes slightly like egg.  There is no cheese to speak of.  I've had Japanese cheesecake before and I understand that they're not nearly as heavy as north american cheesecake but this was not even the flavour profile of the other Japanese cheesecakes I've had.  It was lighter and more eggy.  

If you like egg buns, I say go for it.  But of the six ppl I shared with, 2 of whom are in a teenage \"Asian culture fascination\" mode, all 6 said hands down they wouldn't eat it again.  We actually didn't finish the two pieces of cake we bought between the 6 of us.  

Unfathomable that this is highly reviewed and spoken of. Dastardly.  Coming from Montreal, I can only say \"ONLY IN TORONTO\"  - more hype, less substance.  Once again."}
{"text":"Finally In Canada and somewhere i can get to! 

Right at Bay and Dundas this little cake shop is a must try if you like Japanese style Cheesecakes. They're spongier than your regular cheesecakes but the cheese flavor is not left out. But i do warn you it is filling ad gets a bit much so don't get too greedy when cutting your slice. 

They limit 1 cheesecake per person for $10. Medeleins or small cupcakes sized cakes are $2.50 each or buy 3 get 1 free for $7.50 No limits on these. 

I find the small ones not as delicious or amazing at all. I'd only spend my money on the cheesecake really. 

They accept cash and debit only, no credit cards. 

They open from 8am to 11pm. 

Be prepare to line up. Because the line usually cuts through an alley check if the line starts again after the alley or you may be budding someone."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, it tasted good, but I still can't figure out why anyone would wait hours in line for it.

The cheesecake has no crust or toppings, which I liked. It has a different consistency than usual cheesecake, it's light and fluffy, not creamy. 

 It was tasty but don't wait in line for it...wait until one of your friends is dumb enough to wait in line then steal a piece of theirs."}
{"text":"When this first came to Toronto, there was massive hype and it was the biggest disappointment. Luckily I didn't wait 30+ mins for this damn cheesecake that was just not that good. It is different but other than that I didn't understand what was so good about it. 

I would choose this place for price compared to Pablos Cheesetarts but as for taste, I wouldn't

If you're really looking to buy one do it when the line isn't as long but if it is, Union Station has a place ( a little further south). The line ups are less.

LOL not worth it if it's a line. Try it once and forget it. Maybe a good way of treating people to dessert that's different

1.5 stars but rounding down. I hate when things are over hyped"}
{"text":"Came by for the Grand Opening last year and was fortunate enough to not have to wait hours on end (we waited 40 minutes) for a Japanese cheesecake. The first one I've ever gotten was amazing. Light, fluffy, perfect texture and I was super happy. The second time I went back, I waited two hours which was fine because I knew what to expect and what I'm getting. Unfortunately, the cheesecake I got was severely under cooked and wet inside I couldn't even eat it. I know with the high demands, they are trying to meet them but don't lower the quality of your products.

I will go back in the future if there is no line to try them again."}
{"text":"I've seen buzzfeed and tasty videos on this jiggly and fluffy cheesecake and I knew I HAD to try it while I was in Toronto. 

The line can get pretty long but I assure you that IT IS WORTH IT. It is the most soft and fluffy $10 cheesecake you will ever invest in. We bought one initially, but then I brought it back to my parents and once they saw it with their own eyes, they told me to go back to buy another one haha. 

The cheesecake is so good that it'll actually be gone in minutes, if not seconds, so eat each piece slowly - letting the light and creaminess melt in your mouth. 

Even after a couple days of having it refrigerated, it was still amazingly delicious cold or even warmed up for 5 seconds."}
{"text":"Their cheesecakes are fluffy and light, very different from American cheesecake.  They are amazing right out of the oven, but doesn't do well in the fridge after a day or two.  The only thing deterring me from going back are the line ups - consistently over an hour wait. Cash only!"}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype about Uncle Tetsu's cheesecakes, I had to ask myself if they could really be that good.  Why on earth would anyone line up for hours for a cheesecake? I do admit that I have a sweet tooth, but that seems a bit exaggerated.

However, curiosity got the best of me and when I was in the neighbourhood yesterday, I decided to stop by and see if their cakes really did live up to their reputation.  I'm pretty sure I could have found a better use of my time than lining up for some extra calories, but as I said, I was curious.  The wait wasn't that long (about 30 mins) and now I have the privilege to be able to weigh in on their deliciousness.  

Are they good? Yes. Their cheesecakes are delicious.  Unlike the cheesecakes I'm used to eating, this one is light and not too sweet.  It's well worth the calories and some time waiting.  Would I say it's worth an hour long wait (like some people have reported here)? Probably not, but that's just my opinion.  So, if you see that the line isn't too long, you should definitely grab a cake to go!"}
{"text":"So finally got around to trying this fancy cheese cake or whatever it is.

Friend bought some for a birthday event. Tough cookies to them for being sad enough to line up for an hour. Honestly anyone who decided to line up for more than 10 minutes for this needs to get some hobbies. 

Having gone past this place many a time and seen the line up I was expecting much more.
Being used to more standard cheese cake with its crunch I was not even sure if this was the stuff from uncle Tetsu until my friend showed me the box.

Super fluffy, kind of nice but would I ever go out my way for it? No, and would I ever line up longer than a minute for it...again No."}
{"text":"Nice and cheap! There are so many ppl come here and line for the cheese cake!"}
{"text":"There is already a lot of hype surrounding this Japanese cheesecake craze, so I'll keep it brief. 
I've had Uncle Tetsus cheesecake a few times both warm immediately after buying it and chilled after a few hours. Anytime I've eaten it... it's been delicious. Do I think it's worth more than a thirty minute wait? Not really, no.
The sweet cheese flavour of the dessert (or of the breakfast dish, don't judge me) is subtle but so satisfying and it's not even the best part...
The real thrill for me when biting into these treats is the incredibly light and fluffy texture. I can only describe it in two ways:
1. Nibbling on a memory of delicious past cheesecakes.
2. Floating in the sky to bite into a cheesecake cloud.

Seemingly lighter than the very air we breathe the texture of these cakes is a real danger because it makes you feel like it's totally okay to eat a whole one in a single sitting by yourself (or maybe that's just me). 

Definitely a scrumptious snack, but not such a delight that a huge line wouldn't turn me away."}
{"text":"It is soooooooo good and amazing!!!...this is probably the best Japanese cheesecake I have ever tasted!!..it is so fluffy and soft...This location has two stores one sells original cheesecake and the other store adjacent to this store sells GREEN TEA cheesecake/green tea everything (latte, Madeleine, ice cream)...you have to wait in line during afternoon or late at night..I personally think this place can much more efficient if they hire one more person take care of making latte and getting soft serve green tea ice cream ....one person who is at the cashier service has to do everything such as making latte, getting ice cream, grabbing cheesecake, process order...

We tried original Madeline, green tea Madeline, green tea latte, and green tea cheesecake. If you are a Japanese Matcha lover..you have to try ALL their items..the green tea latte is so good!!..green tea matcha flavor is so strong..that i really enjoy drinking it..not too sweet or not too bitter...I like green tea Madeleine better than the original one maybe bc i am a green tea matcha lover.the green tea cheesecake is so GOOD!!..you can only purchase one cheesecake per customer(what a bummer ) ..the cheesecake is just so good!!..not too sweet..it is so fluffy and fresh!..they make it everyday in the morning..when i got my cheesecake..it was still warm....it just melt in my mouth..b/c it is so soft!...i could really taste the green tea matcha flavor..I LOVE IT!!

I will definitely come back again.."}
{"text":"As a wise man once said \"one does not simply get uncle tetsu's cheesecake.\"
You will wait. You will make friends with your fellow line mates, give cut eye to anyone who dares skip the line and once inside, fan yourself furiously attempting to not sweat all over in the quest for cheesecake.

So is it worth the wait? Yes and no I say.

Yes the cake is delicious. I personally preferred the texture once it was chilled overnight in the fridge, but there is something about having the satisfaction of eating it fresh from the oven. Being Japanese my mom has a recipe for cheesecake that I fondly love, hers is similar in texture but heavier on the cream cheese which I prefer as I love the taste of cheese in cheesecake. The madeleines are good and if you only want them, you can ask the doorman/woman to go straight to the counter as they usually have a batch ready to go - these are great if you warm them up in the microwave and have it with a cup of tea. Pinkies up of course.

If you want to avoid the wait, try going at 7-10am when the line is quieter. Otherwise be prepared to wait. When they say 2 hours, they mean it and are pretty accurate. Do check their facebook page for updates to their hours as its not always consistent.

They do take debit now and they will have the matcha cheesecake available starting in August. Personally I'm more excited for this as I love anything with matcha!"}
{"text":"I think the line ups are due to slow and inattentive staff.  We were next in line to order and the cashier just turned her back and started filling boxes of madeleines.  She didn't acknowledge us.  I just wanted madeleines which were available, cheesecakes weren't ready.  She could have checked what people in line want and process them through rather than wait.  The cheesecakes are good.  I did see a guy measuring butter and it was a lot of butter lol.  Only good for a treat once in a while."}
{"text":"Do not get why anyone would go to an Asian dessert place. It is not their thing. Why people stand in line for bland is beyond me.  You want dessert go to a German bakery or Viennese place or a cafe on Roncesvalles.  Get yourself some New York or Philly cheese cake.  But don't waste your money or time waiting for this stuff."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake was awesome, so light and fluffy! BUT having to wait an hour and 20 minutes and only being able to buy one cheesecake was a downer so once the hype and the line dies down I would definitely go again"}
{"text":"Everytime when I pass the dundas street,I will buy this cheese cake. Very fluffy,soft and smooth.It will literally melt in your mouth after u put it on your tougue and I love that feeling.
One thing need to aware that one customer can only purchase one cake each time which means if you want to buy another one, you have to go back to the line up agian and wait for another 15 mins."}
{"text":"For a long line, and the quality. It's a question. However, worth trying it. Myself being originally from Tokyo, never heard of it. From the West of Japan originally. 

Takes debit but credit I don't know. A little bit over priced. If $8 with tax, no problem. $10? A little overpriced despite with tax included. 

If the line is long, forget it I would say..."}
{"text":"They now open at 7am and start making the cakes at 5am. If you really want fresh cakes, I suggest you wait in line or when it gets busy. 

I waited 1.5 hours in line for this cheesecake. If time is on your side, it's worth the wait. If you are in a rush or have something planned, I don't think it's worth it. I recommend waiting with a friend, as time would go by so much faster. I find that waiting 1.5 hours for cheesecake is not worth it. If you love the hype, by all means, lineup and you will get the Uncle Tetsu experience of lining up for a consumable item.  I will go there again if there is no lineup. Not sure when that will be since they already have new products coming out.

The cheesecake is really good. It's something unique that I have not tried before. Its spongy yet light.  The honey madeleines are tasty as well. 

Right next to Uncle Tetsu Cheesecake store is the Unlce Tetsu Matcha Café. Its pretty neat seeing employees make the madeleine at the storefront. I tried the soft serve (all matcha and mixed). I really like the soft serve as it had a lot of flavor to it. However, I find that its not worth the $3.99 price point. They handed me the soft serve one time and I accidentally held in slanted and the entire soft serve fell on the floor. The employee was really nice and gave me another one right away. 

The madeleines were really good and I ate them a few days later and they tasted great. The matcha and the matcha with red bean one had a lot of matcha flavor. 

There is not that much hype for this one as compared to the other store. If you do not want to wait for the cheesecake, this store is an alternative for madeleines, soft serve and drinks.

I did not like the fact that it's a café and yet there are no seats to sit and nothing to enjoy the food and drinks on. Also, it can be quite cramped when it gets busy.

I can't wait for the matcha cheesecake to come in August. Hopefully, there will be less of a lineup when it comes out or else the matcha café will be the same as the cheesecake store beside it."}
{"text":"Many people have commented on the lines, so all I'll say is that the time has cut down significantly, in my experience. It went from 2 hours when they first opened to about 30 minutes when I last went, mid-July. 

The cheesecake is unique from standard cheesecakes. I didn't like it at first, but either it grew on me (friends and coworkers kept coming here and offering me slices), or their recipe improved slightly to my personal tastes. It had an eggy taste before, but now I find it has a slightly more cheesy taste to it. It definitely grew on me.

The Madelines are nothing special though. The ones I've had were like dried out muffins. At $2.22 each, it's overpriced. Even the new green tea flavor (which you have to get from their matcha store next door) is subpar.

I like the cheesecake, but not the madelines. Will definitely try the angel hat whenever that comes out, as well as the matcha flavored cheesecake. Lineups probably won't stop anytime soon since they'll just roll out new products and flavors to keep people coming back, so if you wanna see what the hubbub is about, might as well go now."}
{"text":"I generally love desserts, so I must say the cheesecake was pretty good, but I prefer their honey madelaines. Both are worth a try, but not worth the wait. If I knew how it taste, max I'll wait is 5 minutes! Food quality I gave it 5 stars, taste 3.5 stars, and with the wait time ..overall 3 stars!
I'll come back again and only wait for 5 min..if I specifically feel like a jap cheesecake or madelaine!"}
{"text":"A very hard review to give, the cheesecakes themselves are exceptional and the price reflects that.

The line-ups are insane and potentially not worth wasting a weekend afternoon on; that said I've repeatedly lined-up against my better instincts."}
{"text":"Amazing cheese cake that is soft, fluffy and not as cheesy as regular cheesecake. The line up and limit per person is stupid. Get more ovens or get more space."}
{"text":"The infamous japanese cheesecake store that was suppose to be a must try; so I did, and boy was I a little disappointed. 

I wouldnt say this is a must try place. It's different and unique but that's about all there is to it. There are 2 shops, located right next to each other, matcha on the left and original on the right. It's $10 per cake and limit one per person (or you can re-line up). The matcha cake is smaller than the original one but it's still the same price. 

I personally enjoyed the matcha cake more than the original when hot. But the original tastes much better when it has been chilled in the fridge! I'd say the original japanese cheesecake has a stronger taste of egg while the matcha is definitely sweeter and tastes like strong green tea. They were both fluffy but it's no different from other japanese cheesecake you can get at stores. Probably just average japanese cheesecake. 

There is usually a line up for the original but there are times when there's less people. You'd think the line would go fairly fast because there's a limit to one per person but it's unusually slow since it's such a small shop with so little room inside to stand. The matcha shop doesnt usually have a line so I suppose there are less people that enjoy it. 

Overall I dont think this place is worth lining up for. But if it's short and you've never experienced japanese cheesecake before and would love to try, then go for it! But if you've tried Japanese cheesecake before, then don't waste your time lining up."}
{"text":"Sorry, but this place is overrated. 2 hour wait, a sucker is born everyday.

The cakes taste like cream cheese. I do not know what the fascination is with these cakes.

If anyone who is reading this and is ever in Tokyo, try Pablo cheesecake. Now that stuff is good."}
{"text":"All hype, nothing special. This place is so overrated! It'd be worth it if there was no line, and each cheesecake was $4, but for a 1+ hour wait and a $10+? I think not!

I've had the plain and the matcha, and I like the plain better because the overwhelming eggy flavor and matcha just don't go well together. 

By the way, to most folk this \"cheesecake\" will taste just like a soft sponge cake, but more eggy. That's just the way Japanese cheesecake is. Don't expect to be blown away by some out-of-this-world cake.

Update: the cheese tarts were gross"}
{"text":"Saw the line up one time to be relatively small so I decided it was the day I lined up and tried the cheesecake. The line up was an hour and half still. While in line i saw majority of the workers talking among each other laughing, joking, this is going on while I see them talking directly over food; bunch of spit into the baked goods. This is a big no no!! None of them washed their hands; Most of them were wiping sweat off there faces with there hands. I feel pretty disgusted and would not go back for more cheesecake filled with spit and sweaty Japanese girls."}
{"text":"Guess I was pretty lucky that there were only a few people in line when I decided to try Uncle Tetsu's. You can only buy one cheesecake at a time, and then you get in line again for another one. This can be really annoying if you just want two and have to wait again. But luckily I am just one person. 

Japanese Cheesecake is not at all like what I am used to. I was sort of expecting the richness of American Cheesecake, and instead got the lightness of angel food cake with a touch of cream cheese. Very different texture. Less dessert-like. Very airy. I can definitely say I've never had anything like it. 

For $10/cheesecake, it's a pretty good value. The cheesecakes aren't large, but you can easily get four huge slices or 6 reasonable slices out of it. I didn't try the madeleines, but I heard those were pretty good. Next time, silly stomach!"}
{"text":"This isn't like New York Cheesecake nor like any American Cheesecake. 

This cake has a moist, soft, fluffy like cotton texture with a light cream cheese taste.  There's no crust like a normal cheese cake. NOTE: if eaten immediately out of the oven the texture was bit softer and mushier when eating and a bit of an eggy flavor. However, as it cools the structure of the cake becomes more set. Once at room temperature or even chilled, it is at this point when the texture is firmer  but still soft and more cotton like. 

The wait can be long but worth it, the price is crazy at just $10 Canadian Dollars for a whole cake."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype.

I waited in line because I had nothing better to do and was really in the mood for cheesecake. They are very inefficient in baking cheesecakes. Get another oven maybe? Bake during the night like other bakeries?

Finally got a hot and fluffy golden cheesecake fresh out of the oven. Absolutely no taste. I thought I was eating an egg souffle. Where's the cheese?

I refrigerated it overnight and tried it the next day. The consistency is much better when cold - creamier and more dense. Still not cheesecake though."}
{"text":"Had this a 2nd time at work for dessert after lunch - it was quite good.  I guess the trick is try to eat it as soon as you buy it.  Texture is quite nice, but I think I still prefer the taste of the  japanese cheesecake at T&T"}
{"text":"Came during an off-peak time, so no waiting.  I had heard of their crazy queues, and I would not like to partake in that! It's what you'd hope for in a Japanese style cheesecake, light, soft, delicious.  I'd buy from them again, mainly for my father."}
{"text":"My experience at Uncle Tetsu's Matcha Cafe was mediocre at best.

Came in with coworkers for a beverage and saw the cold brewed iced tea on their menu. After waiting in line the cashier stated that none of the beverages on the menu are available... Why not put up a sign at the front to inform people before they line up?

I decided to try a madeleine instead. After paying I was given a receipt and waited on the side. I then noticed that you have to exchange/show your receipt to the baker to get your order. Tip for the business: The cashier really should explain this.

The matcha madeleine itself ($2.22 + tax) was tasty and had just come out of the oven. May try the other flavor (red bean) in the future.

Overall, the business needs to work on their operational execution instead of relying on long lineups to draw customers in... There won't be a lineup forever."}
{"text":"I got the cheesecake and the madeleines. Both tasted pretty good, but I think the madeleines were pretty good, but not worth the wait. Could get them elsewhere for cheaper and no wait (T&T sells similar tasting ones). However, the cheesecake was both creamy and fluffly, like a sponge cheesecake. I enjoyed it a lot but I would not wait that long for it again. If the line was ever shorter then maybe, but I would recommend people to try it at least once."}
{"text":"3rd time having the cheesecake but this is my first time lining up. Good thing I got there in time as there was only 6 people in front of me and they just finished a batch.  I got the last one in that batch or I would`ve had to wait 10-15 mins for the next wave.  Got super busy when I was leaving as the lineup was around 20 people.  I love their cake and the softness of it.  Taste is very good and not too sweet.  Cash only and only 1 per person."}
{"text":"A little hard to find but there were no lineups on a Sunday around noon. Decently priced and the cheesecake is good."}
{"text":"Is this place worth the wait? Maybe to try it :) ! Not sure if itd be worth the wait regularly. Their cake is worth it though, for price. If there was no line I would probably be a regular here. 

The cake itself is super moist. There is a strong aroma of egg whites when you first bite into it. It is so soft you practically don't even need to bite into if. It definitely doesn't taste as good when put in the fridge for a few days. 

Worth the price, but maybe not the wait. Still a must try though. I'm excited to see when they will offer other flavours like their overseas locations!! Would be nice to see an expansion in flavours.. Maybe green tea and red bean ? :)"}
{"text":"Hoping it is worth the wait. Been here for one hour and still waiting. Starting  to sweat a bit as I approach the cash register. Not sure if it is the heat from the ovens or m6 excitement over m6 first Uncle Tesu's cheesecake.

The place smells great. The sweet smell of cheesecake filling the air. Place is new and clean. Production is slow as all cakes are hand made.

Just saw some come out of the oven. This is going to be good!

Make sure you bring a friend or two along.  They only sell one per customer and it is  cash 9nly."}
{"text":"To clarify - I have only tried Uncle Testu at the Front Street Market. I enjoyed it. It was light and fluffy and not to sweet.

That being said I wouldn't wait an hour for an entire cheesecake. So if you also dont want to spend your day in the heat with a bunch of strangers - go to the market in front of union station! not only is there no wait, but you can also just get a slice vs committing to a whole cake and then feeling sorry for yourself if you eat it all"}
{"text":"The cheesecakes taste better when you stick it in the fridge overnight. No wait time when i went, so that was definitely a plus."}
{"text":"Not the usual sweet cheesecake..  I was expecting something like a regular cheesecake as there was a huge lineup.. But it was okay... Saw a lot of people passing by and swear at the place so I guess they had the same experience.. Lol.. 

But anyways, we went there after seeing the lineup so I guess we should have done our research first.. 

Again, it's not the usual sweet cheesecake.."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake!

Bought 1/4 Slice and couldn't wait to dive in! I wanted to see what the hype was all about.

The cheesecake was much lighter than the New York Style cheesecakes' I've eaten in the past. It's not too sweet and you can really taste the freshness of the ingredients. It's good - but not 2 hours of worth waiting in line for amazing."}
{"text":"Good but not great. Not good enough to justify a one hour wait in line. I guess I went because of the hype. Now that I've been, I won't go back."}
{"text":"i don't know what they hype was all about..i mean, it was good but it wasn't amazing and i wouldn't line up for it. lucky it was by fluke i passed by one day and there was no line so i decided to check it out. i've had japanese cheesecake from t&t before and this was very similar. i would have it again but not if i had to wait

i do like the texture, its like a mix between cheesecake and sponge cake"}
{"text":"For what it's worth, I just want to throw my two cents in - uncle Tetsu's Japanese cheesecake is so perfectly delicious! Unlike New York style Cheesecake, it's much lighter, soft, and moist so each bite melts like a cloud in your mouth. It's sort of the consistency of a sponge cake but a little richer and more bouncy. It's not overly sweet, which is perfect for people like me who want my sugar fix but can't have too much at once. This will set you back about $10 - the serving size is not enormous like western places, but your stomach will thank you for that later!

They're always so consistent on their quality, despite the huge volumes of customers they get. While standing in line, sometimes you can sample their matcha, regular, or chocolate cheese tarts which are just as good."}
{"text":"It's good and affordable but not worth an hour lineup unfortunately. 
An experience though if you have time to kill on a nice day out. 
Super fluffy. Eat it cold and fresh. Doesn't taste good after day 2. 
I also had an extra one which I froze and defrosted one day. Not very good."}
{"text":"I visited Toronto in April and I am still dreaming of Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake. Please open one in Boston, MA, USA! I would wait in line for days for this cheesecake!!!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake is not bad but has nothing on a regular cheesecake. The Madelines are delicious though! I'd get the regular ones, the matcha tea ones taste very strongly of tea (can almost taste the bitterness and herby-ness ). The green tea ice cream sucks."}
{"text":"Really liked this spongy cheesecake, although I admit it is not the typical one and can be a disappointment if you are expecting an ultra sweet supercheesy cake (I do not know what I was expecting because I'd never tried japanese cheesecake before). This one is super soft, spongy, not very sweet, very mild flavor, I liked it.

Also, I was expecting a long wait (I read there's normally a huge line up here), but I arrived and got my cheesecake in two minutes.

Also, the packaging is very cute :D"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough that I didn't have to wait too long for my cake so I have less anguish towards this place than some reviewers might have had. That being said, I was super excited for this cheesecake but couldn't help but feel let down. Sure the cake was super light and fluffy while being extremely moist, but a key part of a cheesecake, is the cheese. The cheese flavour was so faint that I couldn't really discern it. It was more like a creamy sponge cake with a hint of cheese. Personally I am more inclined to visit Bakery Nakamura in JTown. At least there's no line.

Overall, my verdict is that I may return only if there is no line. Generally, it's really not worth the wait in my opinion. I also don't like cash only places since I find them fairly inconvenient at times. But this is just personal preference."}
{"text":"Yeah, the cheesecake was good. I've never tried anything like it--extremely light and fluffy. One hungry-ish person could easily eat the whole thing (all right, all right--I DID eat the whole thing!). That said, I went during a downpour so I waited 2 - 3 minutes. I don't think it's good enough to warrant waiting in the long lines I've seen there. If you happen to pass by when there's no line, it's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"OK.. 

I nearly fainted (although I did feel really sick probably from  seeing something traumatizing)  for this delicious cheese cake!!

I waited in line for 1hr and a half. Unfortunately there was actually someone who did faint behind me and got hurt pretty badly. But that's how you know!! these people  can be so committed to get uncle tetsu!!

From what I heard from people in line they only make 11 or 12 cakes at a time.  So each batch is fresh!! And you can smell it from outside!!  It's about $10 each cake.  You can refrigerate it up to 3 days and it will still taste fresh. I tried eating it as soon as I got it but it tasted to me a little undercooked like Chinese steamed egg with mix of flour. So I did go home and rebake it for 5minutes. It was deliiiiccciouss !! 

The people there are REALLY nice! They saw me not feeling well and offered me to sit on a chair and some water.  You don't see that very often in Markham

So.. Is it worth the parking and wait.. Umm

Yes, I would say so for the experience !! Also, I would recommend you to share with your family !! So bring a friend or family member because limited 1 per person"}
{"text":"I don't get it. I bought into the hype and waited for two hours and when I anxiously bit into the cheesecake it tasted exactly like those angel food cupcakes you buy at Chinese bakeries for a dollar. Staff were unarguably lovely and decor is cute, but I'm completely lost as to why people are so into this dessert."}
{"text":"To see my latest update on this place go to Zomato.com, a much more dedicated site for reviews. I happened to be passing by on my bike and the lines were short (15 min) so I thought this would be an opportunity to try Uncle Tetsu Canada  (Is there an Uncle Tetsu somewhere else? No!). To start with the service: I wasn't impressed.  The lady in charge of the line let several people jump the line which I felt was being very unkind to her customers that were patiently waiting. I was going to say something as I normally would but it was hot and I didn't really care.  I already knew this was going to be a one time shot for me. As for the product, it didn't win me over.  I wouldn't go back, not that impressed, average at best. Nothing new here, you can get this anywhere for less. They seem to pay more attention on the packaging of the product than the product itself (typical smart Asian business). I have traveled all over Asia and have had many spectacular Asian treats and I WOULD NOT consider this to be one of them. I would say it is just ok at best and definitely not worth the wait.  As for the lines, I really don't get it. I'm not one to line up and each time I break my rule and stand in line it seems for not  and this place has once again confirmed this.  I just can't give this place more than 2 stars. Bad customer service, bad customer policy, over priced for what it is, and available just about anywhere for less."}
{"text":"Delicious but the Line is very long all day, every day. I keep waiting for the day they franchise.  Hint hint."}
{"text":"It was not bad. I woulnd't wait for an hour to get it. I actually preferred the matcha cheese cake to the plain one."}
{"text":"Line is long but in my opinion, worth it. The cheesecake is fresh and warm when you get it, it's only $10, and it also tastes amazing when you eat it chilled. Amazing melt in your mouth texture with great flavour.
The only thing I didn't like is that you can only buy one cheesecake per person."}
{"text":"people are still waiting for hours to get the cheesecake... tasty but not worth waiting that long."}
{"text":"The cheesecake is made fresh to order, so even though there is usually a line-up outside the store, it moves quite fast whenever I'm there. Usually, they would have already packed the fresh cheesecake in the box when it is my turn to be served. It takes some time to make each batch of cheesecakes, however the quality of the cake is proof that they spend a considerable amount of time to ensure their quality is top notch. The cheesecake tastes great and is affordable."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the other locations but this one didn't have the long lines that I have heard the others have which is nice. It is a small location so the trade off is that they only sell the original cheesecake and nothing else but that was okay for me since I was trying it for the first time. 

In terms of taste and texture, I quite enjoyed it, not too sweet and you could taste the cream cheese a little bit too. It was very subtle which I expected from the Japanese dessert. It was also very fluffy with a texture that was different but not unpleasant. The cheesecake was also still warm and had obviously been freshly baked when I got it. 

It would be nice to have other options next time and I thought the sign saying only one per customer was a little weird considering most times when I have gone by there, there is no one in line, but otherwise a good experience."}
{"text":"Now the line ups for this spot have become a bit more manageable I suggest one give it a try if you haven't had this kind of dessert (a bit of a stretch but this is the best way to define it) before. This is a Japanese take on a cheese cake so one shouldn't go in expecting an almost equally popular cheese cake factory version (gasp!). However like cheese cake factory this version isn't anything special IMO. I would describe it as a souffle' omelette (less eggy as there is flour in it) or a cross between an angel cake with a slight hint of cheese. Best eaten fresh IMO as if it gets cold one can just pick up a similar offering from many ethnic grocery stores/bakeries that offer a similar version sans the wait. 
3 stars for a fresh version. If one has to wait more than 15-20 min down to 2.5 stars :)"}
{"text":"Love the taste, I heard there's a  New store opened at uptown but I didn't find it. Anyone knows about that?"}
{"text":"I'm not going to sit here and write a review about how long I waited in line for a damn cheesecake.  Ok wait, maybe I am...  Well the GF and I waited until the hype died down and it was basically closing time to get a shot at one of these infamous cheesecakes that everyone and their uncle's moms friends cousin is talking about.  It was about 10:30pm and there were maybe 10 people in front of us, so we waited....and waited and about 45 minutes later we got a fresh out the oven cheesecake.

I must admit the packaging is so Kawaii, I mean like this is the type of bag they would stuff a hello kitty or cosmetics from Japan in.  Right down to the strings on the bag, which are red shoe laces!  Heck even the tape they use, is Uncle Tetsu branded.  I would give the presentation and packaging a solid 5/5.  Also when you walk around downtown people look at your Uncle Tetsu bag as if it was a Chanel or Louis Vuitton!  Rock that bag with pride ladies!  On a serious note, the cheesecake itself is good, not great or amazing, just good.  It's like eating a spongy marshmallow made out of cream cheese, as my best description.  I've had Japanese cheesecake before and it was a bit more firm, so Uncle Tetsu tasted a bit on the creamy/under cooked side of things.

Overall I would buy it again if it was on a store shelf and I didn't have to wait in line for an hour or more.  If you love hype and you're the type to line up for the next iPhone 7, this place is for you.  If you're like me and dread line ups, (especially when you're sweating inside their store!) you might consider getting your Japanese cheesecake fix elsewhere.  Uncle Tetsu stacking dat cheese tho!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait?  Maybe.  Depends on what you have to do for the rest of the day.

Does it taste good?  Yes.

The cheesecake is extremely light and smooth in texture.  How do you get that consistency?  Imagine a cross between normal cheesecake and sponge cake.  That's the best I can do to describe it.  The cheese flavour is quite subtle.  It's not too sweet either."}
{"text":"The cheesecakes are good enough that it is debatable for whether or not it is worthy of a 2-hour wait in line."}
{"text":"Whether you eat it straight from the oven or want to stick it in your fridge to cool it down and make it denser, Uncle Tetsu cheesecake is definitely worth a try. Probably the biggest misconception that people have is about the cheesecake itself so when I hear people saying Uncle Tetsu cheesecake isn't \"normal\" cheesecake as if it's a bad thing, I just shake my head and laugh. Japanese cheesecake is much lighter and \"fluffier\" than traditional New York cheesecake. When compared to cheesecake from T&T or other Asian supermarkets, Uncle Tetsu blows them all away. The taste is more intricate and way better than bland supermarket cakes. 

You can also grab some madeleines while you're there, but I found these to be a bit hard and sometimes tastes stale. I always skip them. The store also sells cheesecake rusks, which are sort of like small, square cookies. These tend to sell out in the later parts of the day, so definitely go early if you want to grab some.

Overall, there's a reason why the line-up at Uncle Tetsu can get so long. The cheesecakes are fantastic. If you're not a fan of long lines, try going earlier in the morning when there aren't a lot of people."}
{"text":"Not a huge sweet tooth but this a good cheesecake. It's not as dense as regular cheesecake, and kind of tastes like a fluffy and airy vanilla cake with a slightly cream cheese flavour. I think it's a good price point for what you get and I think the packaging is really nice. 

Not worth waiting too long for but really good if there was no line. When I went there was no line at all,  and I'd definitely go back to get this cake for someone as a gift or if I'm in the area and theres no line."}
{"text":"It's like angel food cake married cheesecake and made a beautiful perfect baby...here s/he is! The most delicious easiest cake to eat ALL by yourself. Delicious and worth the splurge...just go early, we didn't have to wait at all (9 something on Saturday) and got the cake nice and fresh out of the oven!"}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes in line but did not mind since the smell of fresh cheesecake wafting out of the store made it bearable. The cheesecake was really smooth and it just melted in my mouth, no chewing necessary! I ended up eating half the cheesecake in one sitting since it was so light. Next time I will only get it only if there is no lineup."}
{"text":"Since I have a killer sweet tooth, I knew I had to try this place out after I heard so much hype around it. Luckily for me, the line was pretty short when I got there. While standing in line I knew this cheesecake was going to be worth it, I could taste the deliciousness from the smell. The cheesecake was so cute and delicious! It was my first time having a \"Japanese cheesecake\". Definitely a lot different from traditional cheesecake, it was super fluffy and light, not like the traditional rich and dense texture. However, it had a rich unique flavor in its own way. It's almost like a Chinese sponge cake but lighter, fluffier, and richer."}
{"text":"Green tea cheesecake with red beans: 2/5
Original cheesecake: 4/5

There are enough reviews for this place so I'll keep mine simple and short. A lot of people are jealous this place due to the long lineups. But let me tell you that it's actually warranted. These cheesecakes are good, but a little pricey for what you get. You can either line up for the original cheesecake or go next door for the green tea cheesecake. The original cheesecake typically has a lineup, and for good reason.

Both the original and green tea cheesecakes are $10. However, the green tea cheesecake is significantly smaller, is less sweet, and flakes apart more easily. There isn't much of a tea flavor in it, and it's quite underwhelming compared to the original. Most people, me included, prefer the original cheesecake.

They're best served cold, so don't eat it right away. Keep refrigerated for best results."}
{"text":"I'm honestly not a huge fan of cheesecakes but I tried this yesterday and it wasn't bad. My friends loved it. It was very spongy and it melts in your mouth. Perfect with tea! The line is very long tho. My friend had to wait for an hour to buy one. And they only sell one per person! Cash and debit only!!"}
{"text":"What kind of Elite Yelper would I be if I didn't try this product and review it!

I walk by Uncle Tetsu every day on my way to work AND back, so twice at least depending on what I'm doing that day.  I've seen the line in various stages of glory -- three people deep, three hundred people deep, and one day a month ago, ZERO people deep - just an open door and no customers in line.  I slowed down, hesitated, and decided not to purchase the cake.

Every since then, I've been obsessed with reading the (extremely frequent) new reviews of this product.  What does it taste like? Sponge cake? cheesecake? eat it warm? eat it cold? was it worth it? was it not?  I became haunted by my choice to not buy the cake when I had the (easy, fast) chance.  I swore if I ever walked by and there was no one in the shop, no matter what I was doing, I would buy a damn cake.

Today, my friends, was that day.

I immediately walked in.  My entire transaction took less than 60 seconds.  The cake was warm, steaming inside the box.  Let me first applaud UT on it's marketing and packaging.  Cute bag, cute box, nicely wrapped up, cute cake, cute stamp.  Cute, cute, cute.  

Here's how I would describe the taste.  The warmer the cake, the more eggy the taste, the creamy and richer.  More like a sweet, hot omelette.  The colder the cake, the less flavour but more structure.  More like a cheesecake, but without a very rich flavour.  I think it reached it's best flavour of \"cheesecake\" after cooling for 2 hours after purchase, then refrigerated for 5 hours.  But, I myself could see enjoying the warm, egg taste with a hot tea!

I really enjoyed all the various flavours this cake took on.  Because of the size, and the cute packaging, it would make a great gift to bring to someone's house.  I myself shared it with two co-workers, and then three friends, and everyone was excited to try the novelty.  If this was the type of store that always had zero line up, like I was fortunate enough to partake in, I would purchase again.  

Now to try the matcha cake!"}
{"text":"Personally, I didn't mind waiting 1:40 in line to see what the hype was about. If you can, bring a friend along to help kill the time waiting. Can't really say much about the place in detail, since it's just an open kitchen and a register. Cash only, however.

While the cheesecake itself was good, I actually loved, loved the honey cakes... I had one of those Homer Simpson \"I wish I was eating that yodel right now\" moments on many occasions thanks to the honey cakes.

There is also a limit of one per each item per customer, which is great so that everyone gets an opportunity to try the desserts and, I can't believe I'm saying this, to avoid any scalping... Only in Toronto."}
{"text":"I do not understand why people love this so much. It just tasted like eggs to me. Is this how Japanese cheesecake is? If so they are missing out big time on flavour. 

I will never eat this again unless I'm in the mood for a quiche"}
{"text":"Eat it fresh. If you can't eat it fresh them make sure you microwave it for 10-15 seconds to restore it to it's almost original fluffy goodness state."}
{"text":"Mediocre. Don't really understand the hype."}
{"text":"This place is always packed with long lineups on Bay street.  People who have no clue about what's the hype about Japanese style cheesecake  wonder why the lineup.  If you ask me if it's that delicious for a 2 hrs of lineup, I will tell you please forget it. One hr MAX.  BUT please read my review to the end. 

First of all, Asian desserts in general are not very sweet and heavy.  I would not be able to finish a big slice of regular cheesecake but can probably eat this whole 6\" in minutes.  Japanese style cheesecake is almost like sponge cake with a soft cheese taste.  The cake just almost melts in your mouth when consuming.  It's soft, fluffy, creamy, light... It is seriously delicious.

The reason there's a lineup (what I heard from a lady working there while lining up the first week this shop is opened) is because of this:  Each batch of 12 freshly baked cheesecake takes about 45 mins.  When I lined up, there were only 2 ovens at work.  The two batches are about 20 mins apart.  Also, the idea was to not serve customers with any cracked cheesecake.  So, to think about this, you are technically waiting in line for freshly baked cheesecake; rather than waiting in line because of a hype or that they are trying to serve you slowly.

I enjoy this cheesecake when it's hot, at room temperature, cold (after refrigerated), and even after warming it up a bit by putting in oven.  The taste is still delicious in different temperature.  This is not something you can do with the regular cheesecake.

Thank you Uncle Tetsu for bringing this to Canada!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten this cheesecake when other people have picked it up. I really don't know what the attraction is. I much prefer regular cheesecake :)"}
{"text":"To begin, I'm just crazy and love lining up. No of course not, who wants to wait for hours in the rain to eat a cake. Anyhow, you are expecting at least an hour wait if you want this damn cheesecake (and really it's longer). Uncle Tetsu only has 3 ovens running so the production numbers are quite low. I have heard rumours that the staff will even throw away cheesecakes that aren't \"good quality\" but who knows? I'm giving you lots of warning right now but BRING CASH and be aware that it is ONE CHEESECAKE PER PERSON. Exceptions will be made in special circumstances, there was one lady who was lining up while a family member was looking after her baby. They came frequently to check the line but the baby could not withstand the cold temperature so they went in and out. The restaurant did make an exception to give out 2 cheesecakes, given that the family member was always present. Not sure if everyone in line hated that lady but I saw the whole thing happened. One positive - after waiting for hours you will actually make friends just like myself lols.

The cheesecake is like $8 + tax but it will feed more than one person. It is not your average cheesecake and is more like sponge cake. It is quite light and my colleagues complained that they tasted more egg than cheese. The madeleines that are made look more like muffins lols. They honestly taste like Hong Kong muffins except with more flavour (and I love the crunchy top). I really do like Uncle Tetsu but please do yourself a favour and don't line up for hours. I said I like their stuff but I didn't say the food is AMAZING. Let me put it this way, I've had better cheesecake in Japan lols."}
{"text":"I walked by here a couple times, trying to see if there's ever a small line up. Finally, on one day, There was only 3 people outside. So I decided to jump into the line. Still waited about 15 minutes or so.

The cheese cake itself was good, but I'm not sure if I'd ever line up 1-2 hours like some other people do for the cheese cake. I'd probably come here a bit more often if it weren't for the line up (I'm impatient. 15 minutes is about the max I'd wait).

Quality: 8.5/10. Value: 7.5/10. Service: 7/10. Overall: 7.5/10 (Not an average)."}
{"text":"I even met the owner. Delicious cakes. I love it there. The line is worth it!!"}
{"text":"I waited a long time to try out Uncle Tetsu Canada but I was walking by and the line was extremely short. I only had to wait 30 minutes and was the last person to get the cheesecake out of the group. 

The cheesecake itself was very delicate and soft. I felt like I was eating a pillowy cloud of fluffy cake. I actually loved the taste, it was quite rich. 

It is definitely recommended to try it after you refrigerate it. Make sure you go before 11 or 12 and the line up will be short!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I got served and how reasonably priced the cheesecake was, considering all the hype and the perpetually long lineup. Unfortunately, I didn't think the cheesecake was all that great. It's a bit TOO mild and subtle for my taste. I think I would have preferred it with a topping or something."}
{"text":"I waited 1.5hrs to get my hands on the cheesecake! Super yummy and fluffy, definitely worth the hype. They are having matcha cheesecake out starting in August, so waiting to try that. I've been 3 times now. Morning waits are a bit better, but means you have to wake up super early."}
{"text":"This place is such a great find! If you are a lover of cheesecake, pastry and/or bakeries this is definitely the spot.

The wait wasn't that bad compared to other Yelpers as my boyfriend and I only had to wait about 20 minutes. Keep in mind if you are wanting more than one cheesecake, make sure you bring more than one person.

This is not your traditional cheesecake people. It is so fluffy with a surprising cheesy center. Light in taste and makes you feel like you are eating a puffy cheesy nimbus cloud. It also maintains that same flavor and texture the next day.

I recommend pairing it with Uncle Tetsu's Matcha Green Tea latte from next door."}
{"text":"I was never enticed to wait in line just for a cheesecake, however, I had family visit from NYC so I decided to wait and give them a shot.

Stood just under 2 hours at night getting in on the last batch of the night.

Not about the wait, I get freshness but just make bigger batches if you have that many customers that you have such a long line up. 
I believe they were expanding so hopefully that's what they'll be doing.

In terms of the actual cheesecake, it was good and I would pay for it again but I wouldn't wait in line for it again and I don't think it lived up to my expectation of the hype."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try the famous cheesecake.  Got there on a Saturday around 1pm and the line was just a little out the door.  Waited about 10-15 minutes which isn't too bad considering the much longer lines and wait times other yelpers reported.  Maybe the hype is starting to die down?  

I don't get downtown very often so decided to order a bunch of things to try.  I got the original cheesecake, green tea plain cheesecake, angel hat and the regular madeleines.  Everything was very good.  The original cheesecake is not too sweet and tasted very light and a bit eggy.  If you put it in the fridge and have it the next day the cake becomes more firm and you can taste the cream cheese a bit more.  The matcha cheesecake has a very strong matcha flavour, I would probably skip this the next time.  The angel hat was very fluffy and more cream cheese in flavour compared to the original cheesecake. Not really my cup of tea so will also probably skip the next time.  The madeleines were VERY good.  Just the right amount of sweetness!

All in all, I would probably come back for the regular cheesecake and the madeleines but only if there is a minimal line and if I'm already in the area."}
{"text":"EDIT: This review was for the matcha side of Uncle Tetsu's before they merged the pages.

--------------------------

Skip it. 

The madeleines DO have the same special as the regular Uncle Tetsu's next door (buy 3, get 1 free). I had the red bean ones straight out of the oven and found them to be average. 

The $4 matcha soft-serve ice cream was a complete rip-off. I guess it might depend on how many fucks the employee has to give at the moment, but I don't think you can request more ice cream as other Yelpers have suggested. When we asked how much ice cream you get before ordering, they said it was exactly 4 swirls. As another Yelper observed, it barely filled the cup (I wish I had taken a picture as the ones currently uploaded don't represent the near-empty cup I had). 

Neither the madeleines nor the soft-serve had a distinct matcha taste. I could barely taste the matcha in the soft-serve.

The matcha cheesecake with red bean was a completely different texture from the original cheesecake. It falls apart everywhere and was very crumbly. It tasted good though, just again, not very matcha."}
{"text":"I've passed by here dozens of times never lining up because of wait time. Finally, I passed by on a day where the line was only about 20-25mins. 

I was a little weary of the cheesecake since I've heard polarizing reviews. However, I thought it was good, light and not too sweet. It definitely doesn't taste like a traditional cheesecake. It's texture reminded me of ricotta cheese. 

If i had to say whether it is worth the wait? No. But it definitely is worth a try. 

Side note: The madeleines were very tasty. You don't have to wait in the long line for those!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out from all the hype. My boyfriend and I stopped by on a Wednesday around 5pm and there was no line. The shop is divided into two mini shops with separate entrances. One side sells the infamous Japanese cheesecakes (which are $10 each) and the other side sells cheesecake tarts (which are $3.50 each). We bought one cheesecake and two tarts (matcha and cheese). The tarts were quite delicious! I preferred the matcha one as the cheese one was quite cheesy. The cheesecake was alright. I've never had Japanese cheesecake before, so I didn't know what to expect. The texture and flavour are very light. I almost feel like it would be better with some sauce, like a strawberry or blueberry sauce. I'm glad I tried it, but I won't be running back for more."}
{"text":"Great Japanese cheesecake! The cake is fluffy, moist and perfect for a small party. Buyer beware, it's delicious and will be a huge hit with those who love light cheesecakes. :)

I waited for about 1 hour during a weekday lunch. Every so often a woman would come out to let us know how much longer wend have to wait. Considering they make a batch (12) cheesecakes every 15 minutes the wait goes by pretty fast. One thing I did notice is that they don't sell imperfect cheesecakes. I love their dedication to providing perfectly made cakes rather than pushing out cakes. 

One thing to keep in mind is that once you enter the store, it's incredibly hot inside. I went on a warm day and boy, did I feel the heat. :) would definitely go back to get another cake once the hype has gone down."}
{"text":"I guess they have to come up with new stuff to keep people coming and lining up. ANGEL HAT CAKE? More like angle air cake. It's like the cake died and gone to heaven. It's so light, you can't even remember eating it after it's gone. It's like a ghost cake. 

Saw they had new product so decided to try it. Had their regular cheesecake before, it's really way smaller than regular cakes. You think $10? Not that expensive right? but it's like half the size of a regular cake. And now they came up with a better way to rip you off. Put even less ingredients in a cake and charge you the same price. 

This angel hat cake is even smaller. And it's super light, like super light. Full of air. I'd bet they beat the crap out of those egg whites to incorporate all the air bubbles in there. It's almost like cheese foam. I almost feel like it's something that accompanies a main dish and not a standalone dessert. It's like the light freshly whipped cream that goes on a cake. Needless to say that I was disappointed. Luckily I didn't have to line up for this one. But You paid $10 hoping to have some sweet fulfillment in your mouth after you enjoy your dessert but you really feel like you didn't eat anything at all. $10 down the drain."}
{"text":"This review is for the matcha green tea cheesecake and not the original.  

The line for the original was too long and only about 10 mins for the matcha so went for that.  The matcha cheesecake was soggy, gooey and disgusting.  I couldn't even eat it.  It was like someone poured water into the middle and I was eating a wet sponge.  I ate the edges and tossed the middle.  I'm hoping that was a one off and someone made a mistake but I won't be trying it again to figure it out.  We also ordered the matcha Madelaine with red bean and that was OK...nothing special.  At least it was edible."}
{"text":"Child please......This place is child's play. No reason for the wait. The recipes online are better and don't take as long."}
{"text":"If you like traditional rich cheesecake like I do, then save yourself some money and most importantly time and go elsewhere. The cheesecake they serve is fluffy, smells and tastes like eggs. Lotsa eggs. It is also completely not sweet. I do not get the point of such cheesecake.
To add to that are atrocious wait times. I get it. Their marketing trick is that they make it very fresh, but really - lining up at least for an hour to buy it.
Been there, done that (once), and not going to do that again."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype as Public enemy once said. The cheesecake tastes to me the same as the t&t. They do use the best ingredients as I saw them baking the cakes but this was not worth the lineup only to be able to purchase one cake when I needed 4. The Madeleine's were dry and did not taste as good as I expected either. I would rate this as a snack you should only eat as your last resort."}
{"text":"Incredibly fluffy, just right on the sweetness, melts in your mouth, doesn't have that funny after-taste that Western style cheesecakes do. But you might still like to have something to spread - some fruit preserves, nutella, etc. It's certainly the nicest 'plain' cheesecake I've ever had. New York's got nothing on it. Keeps well, doesn't fall apart outside the fridge.
So taste wise, it's worth it. I just haven't decided if the wait is worth it - but that might be improving. To be fair to the staff, they are incredibly efficient. They just don't have enough space or kitchens. They've got to wait 40 mins for each batch of 5 or so. I went a few months ago and queued for 2 hours. However, this week I only waited 20 mins. It was the same time of day as last time so maybe I got lucky or maybe their new place next door has made a difference, I'm not sure. 

Bottom line: Great product, but don't wait unless you specifically want it. Bring a book if you do. If you just want a bit of dessert to finish off the night go elsewhere.
The madeleines, both matcha and regular, are a waste of money. Typical plain cake."}
{"text":"Fluffy light cheesecakes that are quite enjoyable! We got lucky and went at 1030pm and happened to see no wait so I thought I would see what all the hype is about! Usually there is a line along the outside walls but we just saw a few people and we got our ticket for a cheesecake (1 max per person) and they cooked in the oven and 10 minutes later we got it, paid and left! We love traditional cheesecake so didn't know what to expect but definitely tasty and light. Friendly staff and looks like Japan's little treasure made it to Toronto. Look forward to seeing what else they offer.....if you like cheesecake and want to try a lighter version go check it out! That being said, I wouldn't wait the average 1hour+ to get it - not worth that especially in the cold in my opinion!"}
{"text":"So we decided to go and try this place, finally.  it was a sunday night around 9pm, the line didn't seem that long and it took a total of 25 minutes to get our cake.  not too bad.

On our drive home, our car smelled of sweet pastry, like what at pacific mall.  not a bad thing.when we got home, we were both impressed with the bag and packaging.

and the actual cheesecake?  it didn't taste like your traditional cheesecake. it was a lot lighter and fluffier.  more like a cheese mousse.  but it was still delicious nonetheless.

we would go back, but i'm not sure if we would be willing to wait for anything longer than 15 minutes."}
{"text":"tetsu is a small bakery back to back with its counterpart matchacafe. they bake fresh japanese cheesecake. first off, no jiggle (so dont get your hopes up) price is about right. i could only purchase a whole cake for $10 so a quarter slice would cost around $2.50.

ive tasted a better cheesecake and it wasnt even freshly baked. this one was very eggy and dense in the core. Overall, it was worth a taste try."}
{"text":"The wait was two hours long . They only allow you to buy one cheese cake .it was good . It was a good thing there was 4 of us . I would not do it again . Price was reasonable.  It was not very sweet which I liked"}
{"text":"Do you love standing for hours at a time? Does the thought of spongy cheese flavour entice you?
If so, uncle tetsu's is the place for you!

Complimentary with your 2 hour wait is a restriction of one cake per person and grainy, somewhat stale Madeleines. 

If you are a chosen one, you will receive a ticket that guarantees a cheesecake! This magical ticket will make you reconsider every time you want to leave the line. \"Maybe just 15 more minutes! You might as well stay since you already got a ticket!\"

When you have finally fought your way to the front in order to throw away your money, you will be rewarded with something that tastes like a cheese flavoured steamed egg. And don't forget those grainy Madeleines!

Thank you, uncle tetsu's, for limiting the number of cheesecakes I could buy because my mom just spat out her share.

One star for fluffiness, one star for the employee with the perma-smile"}
{"text":"Went through the line in about 5 minutes on a Sunday afternoon - I've eaten the cheesecake before, and it's as wonderfully soft and fluffy and delicious as it's hyped up to be. Even better after a day in the fridge (if you have self control)."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this because it physically looked just like the famous jiggly cheeSecake from Japan. Upon arriving the story it was filled with the amazing smell of cheeSecake. Each customer is allowed to buy one cake only. We tried it fresh, and two days old. Both me and my bf agreed that it tasted better after being in the fridge for two days.  The freshly made product tasted really liquidy and obviously texture  changed after being refrigerated which was even better."}
{"text":"The matcha cafe side often has no lineup compared to the original store front. They sell matcha cheese cake (normal/red bean), madeline (matcha/matcha red bean), and soft serve ice cream (matcha/ vanilla/mix). There are also coffees, but I did not see any one ordering that. The cheese cakes ($10) and madeline ($3/pc) were okay at best. Maybe it's because I had better in Asia and even some of the other Japanese bakeries in the city. I thought the ice cream was mediocre. You can probably get a small tub of similar if not better tasting matcha ice cream at T&T or Galleria (asian supermarkets). However, they package the cakes/madelines in a really nice box and bag , which could be given as a gift. Overall, Uncle Tetsu is okay, but not to the point of lining up for hours."}
{"text":"I do not get it what the line is all about. I heard people wait for an hour or more to get it. It wasn't a big line for me so I thought I'd give it a try. It's not bad but not great either. Just soft cheese cake which I don't think I'll buy again."}
{"text":"This was my first time having one of these guys and I LOVED it! FYI, it's not your typical cheesecake. It might feel like one but once you taste it, you ll find it's more soft and fluffy. There's no crust like a normal cheese cake. I would also argue these are alot more liquid. This whole cheese cake was 10$, easily shareable to 4-5 people. I went in on a Friday after noon and there wasn't a long wait at all"}
{"text":"It was OK for 5min wait. Not the best Cheesecake I have had.

Also I don't think they are a popular brand in Japan. In China Uncle Testu cheese cake are sold on Groupon like website."}
{"text":"So like many of you, I have tried this cake and not because I waited in line, nope. 
Not doing that. 

However someone I know did and gave me some. Otherwise, who knows when I would have tried it since in my opinion there are very few things worth waiting in line for 20-30+ minutes in life and a small Japanese cheesecake simply ain't one of them. 

It is a testament to our capitalistic society when people will wait for days in front of a store, say for a smartphone and in some cases over an hour for one (they were limiting cakes to 1 per customer when my friend went) $9 cheesecake per visit. The fact lineups continue after these many months seriously exemplifies that we are hitting the apex of 1st world problems here.  

The cheesecake is okay. Not heavy like your NYC or Philly cheesecake. Rather spongy in texture and unlike a refrigerated Western counterpart, you can leave this cake out in room temperature for half a day and it will be just fine when you come back. 

It is rather light, soft and a little more fragrant, as such the scent of cheese will travel deeper, leaving a longer mark in your sense of smell. It is not bad.  

Is it tasty? Sure. Is it worth waiting longer than 3.33 minutes. No. Not even close. I still do not get the fascination over this particular brand. 

A slight reveal: I have been having Japanese style cheesecake for months now. You can buy it, freshly made in some of the Chinatown bakeries on Spadina for about $4. Not a slice, the whole cake, perhaps a bit smaller than UT's cake. Flavour is pretty much the same, if you eat the one at UT, you will like these cheesecakes too. 

You walk in, you pay, you walk out with 4 in hand if you want, all in about 30 seconds. 

Again, UT's cakes are not bad, yet I do not understand the desperation to stand in line for 30+ minutes for these cakes when equal flavour and quality can be had for less time and money just a 10 minute walk west."}
{"text":"In later life, when sharing share songs from when you were in high school, your audience can never enjoy those songs as much as you do.  The memories of good times and great adventures that accompanied those songs are missing. 

Something similar must be going on with this place. I don't have whatever sweet, young Japanese childhood memories that these cakes must have accompanied. So for me, it's a cheesecake mixed with the dough of a barbecue pork dim sum bun. Yes, it's lighter.  Yes, the seared logo on the cake is fun.  But I'm clearly missing the backstory that must be fueling the long line ups.   

Enjoy the memories, you devoted Uncle Tetsu line up freaks!  Sorry I can never get this place in the same way that you do."}
{"text":"We waited in line about 45 minutes. We got back to work and I shared slices of it with everyone in the office. It's more like a chiffon, sponge like cake that is cheese flavoured. It was nice but I won't be rushing back to stand in line for that. OH! One cake per person. A girl actually got back in line to get another one. 

I really enjoyed the Madelaine cakes. I could have inhaled all four except I was sharing!! hahaha!! Of course with the new store opening I think they are selling them in there, so again not lining up for an hour for those. 

The staff were friendly and nice to speak with, I asked how many cakes they sold a day. She roughly 540, she actually got a calculator out to answer my question. I was impressed with that!

3 stars for waiting in line for an hour from start to finish. Even if I'm not a fan of the product the staff were awesome!"}
{"text":"I first had this creamy cheesecake overseas in Asia!

Soooo glad to have the experience to have it here in North America. Its a simple type cake which many of my friends seemed skeptical at first. It did not look very nice but what I loved about this cake is how simple it is. It is definitely a quality over aesthetics type situation.

The creamy, milky and eggy base to the cake gives it a rich and spongy texture unlike traditional cheesecakes that are much heavier and thick in comparison. It is very light and easy to eat. I find it better to be stored in the fridge. Serve with coffee and maybe some biscuits...perfect afternoon treat!"}
{"text":"I went at 8 am no line ups well worth the wait. Super fresh. Really light like everyone says but I think this is best enjoyed after you refrigerate for a couple hours and let sit out for like 30 mins before eating."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what the fuss is about. It's good, and different than other cheesecake I've tried - less cheesy and less sweet - but certainly not anything to line up an hour for."}
{"text":"Man.... What's all the fuss about? This \"cake\" is just a glorified fluffed omelette with cream cheese. 
The consistency when fresh or microwaved is soft and soggy and tastes only of eggs.... 
The madelaines (which look more like muffins) are way better in comparison to the cake.
Of course I didn't expect a traditional cheesecake or traditional madelaines, but I expected something delicious with all this raving about this place.
On the good side I got there with almost no line (thanks to the cold weather) and it was cool to peak at the baking process in their kitchen. 
But would definitely not recommend this place. Really. No."}
{"text":"This location only serves Uncle Tetsu's standard cheesecake but I love the location and how quickly you can pick up a cheesecake (during non-peak times).

The quality of the cheesecake is up to par with all of the other locations, so you're treated to a delicious, fluffy cheesecake.  Definitely worth a try if you've never had it before!

The only downfall to this location is that it can get very busy during peak times.  If you're trying to get a cheesecake at 5pm you could be waiting a good 10-15 min.  They also only allow one cake per customer if there is a line, which is a fair rule."}
{"text":"It's cheesecake..... ..... .. .

Best part of waiting in line is there is a chatime around the corner. Thank god for that."}
{"text":"~~~~~Attention: Soft Cake Lovers ~~~

***Quality**** Excellent , cheesecake is so soft & puffy- put it to the fridge a few hours before taste if you prefer New York style cheesecake.  I will come back occasionally miss the jap style 's cheesecake

***Wait Time****  Varied
Big time - Try to avoid noon and evening time.   My bet was the AM before 9am
Here is a tool to help you out on finding the best time daily.  Go check twitter@line up at Uncle Tetsu's  - That is the best tool to choose the right time and short line

***Store Cleanliness****:  Good and small sized, prepare yourself to squeeze in

***Customer Service****:  Casher was friendly and alerts us how much longer the next batch of cakes will be ready....in my case....she called out 7 minutes

***Tips*** 
Better grab your friends to wait with you so you kill time quickly while waiting.
Walking is free and parking is not - go on foot, people!


As it is still the same their limitation is....

Rule:  1 cheese cake / person ...not sure if you bring your pet , that may count?! :D


buy 3 madeline cake (small cup cake) and get one free 

It won't cost you more than $20......... $8.88 for cheesecake and $2.2 for each madeline cake....therefore, at least bring $20 with you , my friends!

Good luck to your waiting time!!!!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake is perfect - fluffy melt in your mouth goodness that I can't even begin to explain because now my mind has wandered and all I want is another bite of cheesecake. It tastes nothing like an actual cheesecake, more like a cloud.

I came here around 3-4pm on a weekday and thankfully there wasn't a line out the door like I had seen in the evenings. You can only buy one cheesecake per person, and if you want more, you need to go back into line.

Completely worth it - if you're in Toronto, go now."}
{"text":"Tried to come here this Saturday morning at around 10:15am but it wasn't opened yet. Strange though considering the store had a full-house of employees working away and there was already a line up next door at Uncle Tetsu's. The lady gestured to me that they open at 12. Sucks, I walked there for nothing and was looking forward to bringing some back uptown.

Update: Alright I came here again, this time on a Friday afternoon. I ordered 4 matcha madeleines with red bean and brought them back home to Markham to share with my family. They were quite nice! I'm not a huge fan of their cheesecake but admittedly, these madeleines were yummy. They had a rich matcha flavour and I liked how the red bean filling was chunky with visible pieces as opposed to pasty!

Though not expensive, these aren't cheap either ($2.65 ea + tax) so in perspective with the many Chinese bakery goods I have available to me in Markham, I probably wouldn't buy these that often. Great for \"trying something new\" but eggtarts are still a better bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I keep going back. 
I go when there is no line up... and we cherish the boxed cake as we believe it will be the last time we have it, because I am not about waiting in that godforsaken 45 minute line up.

But nothing compares to the sweet, airy taste of U.T. C.C!!!

recently tried the green tea red bean flavour, good but not as good as the original."}
{"text":"It was an ok cheesecake, I won't recommend it if u have to line up for this. Save ur time and money go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Honestly not the best cheesecake and not worth the lineup. I don't know what the big deal.. My mom makes cheesecake 100x better and Carole's cheesecakes on Yorkville is so much better. Try theirs instead :)"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. It's a long wait but it's worth it. These guys have their cheesecake baking down to an efficient process and the quality is incredible every time.

Note that the line outside is only part of the wait: it continues inside. By the time everyone waits for 90 minutes, they end up ordering as much as they can which usually slows the speed at which it moves a little.

Don't eat your cheesecake right away! I know it's tempting, especially after such a long wait, but it's better if you let it set for an hour or two in room temperature. Also try refrigerating it overnight to give if a thicker consistency (but still fluffy and not nearly as dense as New York Cheesecake)."}
{"text":"1st location in North America!  Yummy stuff!   Light fluffy cheesecake!   Taste totally different when fresh and hot from the oven & chilled!   Worth the queuing!"}
{"text":"My third time here and as others have said, if you see a line, keep walking.  Come back ~1-2 hours before closing and you'll only have to wait a half hour max.  

I quite like their cheesecakes - they're light, creamy and melt in your mouth.  They make all of them fresh so no worries about getting one that's been sitting for a while.  They're also decently sized, which makes it easy to share among friends.  For $10, I'd say it's worth it.  On the other hand, I'm not a huge fan of the madeleines.  They look like bland muffins so I was expecting them to taste like the cheesecake, but disappointingly, they taste like an even blander muffin.  

I have yet to try the matcha cheesecake they serve next door, so that will be my next mission.  For some magical reason, there is never a line to the matcha store, even when the line for the original spans a mile."}
{"text":"Unique and interesting cheesecake. I'm not crazy for it but I'll have it every now and then."}
{"text":"Lined up for the cheesecake as part of the hype when it just opened. I think it's different, and that's why people like it. You could also say it's \"healthier\" since it is less heavy than normal cheesecake (I don't know if this is actually true calorie-wise, so don't quote me). Personally though, I like my desserts to be a bit more substantial, and this just didn't get the mark for me."}
{"text":"Love the cheesecake! The staff was super friendly and it was quite interesting watching them make the cakes! Very reasonable prices :) hope they open up more locations in the GTA! As for the wait times, it's supply and demand!! I definitely don't fault the store for that due to limited capacity (they have 3 ovens) and customers can decide if it's worth the wait before they get in line - just my 2 cents."}
{"text":"Line up more than 2 hours. They only have the original  cheese(6 inches) cakes and Honey Madeleine(cupcake size). I can honestly say the tastes are really so so! The service is not as good as original Japanese stores(okay, they might be too tired)."}
{"text":"It's an ok cheese cake. Stressing ok. I actually just loved walking home with the bag more than the cake itself.  Lol!!! Jealous stares all around."}
{"text":"I walk past Uncle Tetsu's every single day on my way to/from work and decided to finally try it out a few mornings ago when there was barely a line.  I purchased one cheesecake for $10 and shared it with some co-workers.  Honestly, we weren't too sure what the hype is about.  Yes, it's fluffy, spongy and lighter than most cheesecakes, but it's nothing I would line up for on a regular basis.  We ate it at lunch after it being in the fridge for a few hours and it tasted ok.  I always see long lines so I assumed it would be some really amazing cakes so I was a bit disappointed.  

It's sort of an assembly line style place in that you just pick up your cake and leave.  It might be more appealing for some if you had somewhere to sit and enjoy it.  Either way, it's somewhere I might be inclined to pick up a cheesecake from if there were no line and it wasn't out of my way, but not somewhere I think warrants the crazy lines.  The packaging is cute though!"}
{"text":"You know how when you see hundreds or thousands of people line up for the latest iphones on release day? and you laugh at them for being so caught up in the hype? That is what Uncle Tetsu is. Both uncle tetsu and the iphone are WAY OVER HYPED. 

I believe that this cake appeals more to the asian palate , where desserts seem to be lighter and far more bland than american desserts. And for this reason this cake really doesn't appeal to me. For american's, uncle tetsu has a slight resemblance to Sara Lee pound cake... if it was expired. The uncle tetsu cake literally tastes like it's missing something. You will question if there is even any cheese in the cake. 

Do you know what aerogel is(google it... it's really cool)? it's the lightest material in the world composed of 98.2% air. If you could eat aerogel it would taste like uncle tetsu. not because it's full of air(which it might be... it's not dense at all), but because it really tastes like air. 

Please consider how much your time is WORTH. And whether your time standing on a sidewalk for 2-3 hours could be better spent. People go nuts when the TTC subway gets delayed a few minutes but will wait in line for hours for some cake. Haha! What a world we live in."}
{"text":"Yessssssssssss!!!!! I finally get to try you!!!!!! Sorry for the overly excited \"!!!\" but it's true. I was very excited to try this new place. I keep seeing my fb news feeds of all my friends come here for a visit and leaving with bags of Uncle Tetsu cheesecake! 

So naturally, I have to wait in line and try their cheesecake too.I was a little worry about the wait because I keep seeing people saying they waited \"1.5 - 2 hours\" in line for their cheesecake.... so I was prepared to wait more than an hour for mine. To my pleasant surprise... it only took 30 mins! I must had came during an in between time and didn't have to wait too long for my cheesecake. 

Everything is made fresh. The place is a little bit small, but from what I see - it looks like they will be opening up a new cafe just next door and they will be introducing new treats as well ( I can't wait!) 

I actually really like the cheesecake - it turned out pretty good. But if you like more of a dense taste - I would put it in the fridge then eat it later in the night. 

I will come back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Went to Uncle Tetsu's late night as a last stop before leaving the city of Toronto. I expected a huge line up but the wait was only about 20 minutes. Right after I got my cheesecake however... was when the line got big!

Although I only tried a small piece of it, I could feel the softness of the cake. It was very light and tasty. Let's just say... the hype made it taste that much better."}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area on a Saturday morning at 8am and they were just opening. Only 4 people in line! Friends and family have heard of this place and said I had to try their cheesecake.
I bought 2 types of their Japanese cheesecakes, the original and the less popular Angel Hat, and the honey madeleines.  I also wanted to buy their matcha cheesecake but it was only available in their cafe next door which didn't open until 10am. I thought that was odd. Why sell a different flavour next door only?
The original is much lighter and less sweet than a New York style cheesecake. In fact, it is more spongy and quite nice because it's doesn't leave a heavy feeling.  The Angle Hat is even lighter and smoother than the original. I prefer it over the original. 
No matter how good, I would not wait in line for more than 15 minutes. Luckily, I didn't have to. 
The honey madeleines were just okay. I found them dry and very little honey flavour. 
I would probably come back for the Angel Hat cheesecake and I suggest you try it."}
{"text":"The hype has definitely gone down since it first opened. A small bakery located on Bay Street that only sells their famous cheesecake and madelines (which are mini cupcakes). The cheesecake is very good when hot because its soft and fluffy. When it sits in the fridge overnight then it essentially taste like an angel sponge cake. Very buttery though so if you are not a fan of buttery goodness, this place might not be the one for you. If you do not want to wait in line for the cake, go on a weekday during work hours!"}
{"text":"The only reason there were line ups is because the store is small and there's limited space to wait inside. They deliberately set up the order and production system so that customers have to wait. It's their marketing strategy to create hype. Another store like Love Me Sweet can produce the same thing and NOT make you wait. Actually wait...Love Me Sweet tastes better. 

The cheesecake itself is not too bad. The hype is dead and finally I managed to order one without waiting. Not worth $10. I'm not the type to buy into hypes. I like to pay for the value and quality of the food. For $10 I would say you're paying mostly for the gimmick and that fancy paper bag. Within 2 years I think the hype will be mostly gone. If you don't have line ups in nice weather, I don't imagine they will have much business in winter. 

And also, Uncle Tetsu is almost unheard of in Japan. He has no presence in Japan. He has been expanding overseas and basically relying on Chinese customers who think this is an authentic Japanese brand. Ask any Japanese person and they can tell you this brand is non-existent in Japan, and some may even go \"huh\"?"}
{"text":"Came here early Sunday afternoon. First time here and the best part....No lineup!!!! Seems like hype is over now. Also went over to the cafe beside it and got the green tea Madeleine. Both taste great!"}
{"text":"My friends and I wanted to try the cheesecake from this place the second we saw the line in the afternoon. My friends went early next morning when there was no line and  got 2 cheesecakes and some Madeleine cupcakes.

The cheesecake had a cute little uncle testu logo in the middle of it, really grabbed my attention. After my first bite of the cheesecake, it blew my mind. It wasn't the best cheesecake I had in terms of taste but the texture was the most unique. The cheesecake was definitely good, the fluffiness of it however was amazing. Felt like I was eating a cheesecake flavor cloud.
The Madeleine cupcakes were delicious too but the cheesecake was the star. Would definitely recommend to try the cheesecake."}
{"text":"They have a limit of 1 cheesecake and 4 madelines per order/per person.

Line is about 30-45 minutes.

But good cheesecake."}
{"text":"The texture of it when eaten cold is firm and not very cheesy at all.  It was a bit smooth and I could definitely taste the quality in the cake.  However, it wasn't mind-blowing.

The next time I had the rest of it, I decided to heat it up.  We don't have a microwave so I put it into the conventional oven for a few minutes.  I actually really enjoyed it hot more than cold.  It was a little crispy on the sides and the inside was very, very soft and fluffy.  Now I could see what people mean when they say that Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake is very light and fluffy.  The cheese flavour was also much more apparent when it was served hot.  I can just imagine how much better it would taste if it was served right out of the oven.  I really am a big fan of it being served hot - fluffy and tasted like a cloud!"}
{"text":"The WAIT:

What seems to be the concern to most people is the wait for these products.  I asked others how long they had to wait and they were curious to know how long I had to wait.  To answer this I had to wait just under 30 minutes.  Other people have had to wait about an hour or more from their responses.  

There is a pretty reliable metric for to determine how long you will have to wait if you see a line there.  For every 10 people ahead of you, you will have to wait about 15 minutes.  The store is very small, in fact it is so small that the only space available is for the 10 people to come in at a time pay, and leave.  

Example:  If there are 35 people ahead of you and you are the 36th person in line then 3 batches of 10 people will be ahead of you and you're in the 4th batch which means you won't get in for about an hour.  

The PRODUCTS:

At the time I went to Uncle Tetsu they only have 2 products; the Japanese cheesecake itself and these muffins called Madelines.  The cake is a no brainer you are there for that so you are automatically getting one.  The muffins (I've also heard them referred to as cookies) are about 2 bucks a piece and if you buy 3 they give you another for free.  

The PRICES:

The cheesecake is 10 bucks.  The sign outside clearly states that it's 10 bucks but it's actually 8 something with tax and works out to be 10.09 but they just round it down to 10 even.  The Madelines work out to be 7.55 after taxes for 4 so basically for the maximum you are allowed come out with it will be 17.55 for one cheesecake and 4 Madelines.  

In case you didn't know you are only allowed to buy this maximum (for now).  You can't roll in and say you'd like multiple cheesecakes, only one per person.  If you want more, bring people with you.

The TASTES:

The cheesecake itself is not what you would expect of a New York style cheesecake because it is not that.  In order to appreciate this food you have to remove what you think you know or what your expectations are when you think of cheesecake as you may know it and just eat the cheesecake.  It is what it is, a lighter, fluffier, non rich, non sweet Japanese cheesecake.  If is so light it almost has the consistency of fluffy light scrambled eggs with milk almost like a flan but it doesn't break apart the same way.

If you are expecting something with the thickness and richness of something out of the Cheesecake Factory then you will be disappointed it's as simple as that.  Let's face it, homemade tomato sauce with a meat broth base is not the same as buying a jar of Ragu.  You simply cannot compare apples to oranges because they are different.  Try to keep that in mind when you try this for the first time.

The Madelines to me are not cookies.  I don't know why others refer to them as cookies.  To me they are muffins.  They are shaped like muffins, they are soft like muffins and they are served in muffin liners that must be peeled away.  I've not had cookies served in muffin liners, ever.  To me these are not special in any way and are in fact over priced for what they are.  

The PACKAGING:

The cheesecakes are put individually into thin cardboard boxes.  The boxes then has a cheesecloth type liner where the cake is carefully placed inside and then covered with the cloth and the lid closed. Keep in mind this cake just came out of the oven minutes before and it will be warm.  Each cheesecake is \"branded\" with the Uncle Tetsu logo in the middle prior to packaging.

The Madelines are simply in a paper bag that is sealed with a sticker. 

Both these items (if you buy both) for me were placed in a large red plastic bag.  The bag was tied and handed over that way. 

Now the cake is warm and with warm things it may cause condensation on the inside.  I'd suggest opening the bag to let it breathe instead of allowing the moisture to condense inside of the tied bag where it cannot escape and thus making the inside of the bag damp.

It took about an hour to get this cake home from downtown before I was able to place it in the fridge to cool.  By the time I arrived home the warmth from the bag pretty much had worn off.  It was suggested that the cake be chilled for about an hour before eating I'm guessing to let it settle.  

The BOTTOM LINE

Anybody that knows me knows I'm not a dessert person.  I'm not big on most dessert but I will have some from time to time.  This was an exception of course considering I had to wait for it.  This was primarily for my wife who knew I was in the city and I asked her if she wanted me to get one.  She enjoyed it as did I for the little sliver of it that I had.  The experience is nice but you'd have to weigh it with how long YOU would be willing to wait for it.  Really I'm sort of indifferent to the products (for now).  They will however add more things and I'm guessing the intrigue may taper of as time goes on.  Hopefully they will always have lines but time will tell.  

For me, 3* only because not really a dessert person."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying a japanese cheesecake. Let me warn you now if you are expecting a dense new york style cheesecake, this is not the place you go to. The consistency is a cross between a souffle and and an angel food cake. It has a light and airy texture that melts in your mouth. It is not worth a 2 hour wait as a lot of people have done including myself but if you're looking for a light cheesy dessert, this was quite satisfying. I prefer this cheesecake more chilled as the texture becomes a bit more dense and enhances the cheese flavour."}
{"text":"The cheese cake was pretty good here. Light and fluffy. Could use a bit more flavor. But very cute presentation. The madeleines were delicious as well. Buttery and soft. 

The lines were loooong!! Not sure if I would stand in the line for 1.5hr though. There's a store for the reg cheesecake and one for the green tea one

Too bad you are only allowed to buy one cheese cake per person."}
{"text":"So we finally, finally waited in line to try this special cheesecake. 

It certainly is interesting - and I don't mean in a bad way. 

It is like someone combined New York cheesecake with a soufflé. It is not to sweet and very light.

I still prefer serious North American Cheesecake Factory style cheesecake, but this is something people should try."}
{"text":"After my early exam on a rainy day, I decided to check out Uncle Tetsu's in hopes that there wasn't going to be any line up because it was about 10-11AM on a Thursday morning. Uncle Tetsu's was relatively close by, so it wasn't too far of a trek. It was raining pretty hard that day too, and there was no line up! I was a happy girl. 

With chalkboard signs at the entrance, it's not hard to miss their store information! Though it is hard to wash off previously written stuff sometimes. The store itself is pretty small for customers to lounge around as half the space had been taken by up machines to make these desserts. It was more of a get-in, get-out type of restaurant.

They had samples of their rusk cookie, and it was more of a hard textured cookie rather than soft... Not my cup of tea. I prefer soft and chewy type of cookies.

They usually limit one cheesecake per person because of their stock and long lineups, but since there was no one behind me, I was able to grab more than one. Service was quick and fast as the cakes were already pre-boxed beforehand. I also managed to go to the Matcha Cafe next door too!

So...!! My purchases after this entire cheesecake run...
-- The madeleines were buy 3, get 1 free - which I took an advantage of! I didn't get the chance to eat the madeleine because it was all gone by then ): !! My dad mentioned that it was good though, very flavourful.

-- Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake were indeed fluffy as well (it's a Japanese cheesecake thing I guess). Although the pieces are more starchy(?) and of a heavier cheese flavour. Making me feel like I've just had a heavy meal, heavy in terms of stuff like very rich in carbs or fatty foods, like burgers or pasta. But I meant more on the \"rich\" side, so more of the feeling after you eat pasta.

No doubt that Uncle Tetsu was the first in the Japanese cheesecake game, assuring the fluffiness of the cakes and consistency of the branding everywhere. Even though the regular cheesecake broke more than the matcha cheesecake, both have the same sticky texture when you put your fork in it and when you eat it - it lingers in your mouth longer because of the texture."}
{"text":"Wow what a crazy hype! I tried my first Japanese \"cheesecake\", Madeleine's and matcha ice today. So where should I start. I waited one hour in line for the cheesecake. So I used that time to try the matcha ice cream. It's different then what you would expect. You get what the name suggests. It's nothing special and won't change the way you see ice cream. If you want good ice cream, Toronto has many better places for that. After the wait outside you finally get into the store. The air is used up, it's like in a sauna. No fan no air-conditioning. Maybe it's better for the cakes. Who knows. But for human beings it's to hot. They should at least offer something to drink or put a fan somewhere. 
When It finally was my turn I got my cake and walked proudly out of the store to bring it home and try it with my family. It's definitely something else. 
I am very happy that it didn't taste like American cheesecake. \"Japanese cheesecake\" is probably a better way to describe it. 
If you expect vanilla, lemon or anything creamy your wrong. 
I would describe the taste like egg and fat taste. The consistency is fluff, nice and Interesting. Still my all time favorite is the German cheesecake. 

So if you would ask me:\"would you go back to pick up another cake?\", my answer is \"No. It's not worth the wait nor the hype\" you guys decide yourself. 
But definitely you should grab a matcha Madeleine they are good with tea or coffee."}
{"text":"I did not go line up at the store so I actually feel REALLY AMAZING about the cake as my coworker brought it to the office. The feeling when you have been thinking about something for 2 weeks and then it just shows up on your desk one day!! :D Thanks Law of Attraction..

Even though the taste might not worth waiting for two hours, the price is great enough for a cheesecake. And it may be a great gift or something these days"}
{"text":"This was my second time eating Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake. I forgot how delicious it is. This was my first time buying it, and the purchasing process is really why I give this 4 stars instead of 5.

So we got there at 9pm and the wait was literally an hour. We only waited outside for 25 mins. Then we were waiting inside. That was awful. It's very hot. It's a small space with people lined up shoulder to shoulder. There are only 3 ovens for the cakes. Each oven takes 12 cakes and it takes 45 mins to bake a batch. So our inside wait was like 35 mins.

But honestly. It was a nice night. I was in good company. The wait could be handled. Definitely for the cake at the end. I know a lot of people think it's all hype, I don't have any comparison to other Japanese \"cheesecakes\" but I find this to be delicious. It's not like actual cheesecake, which is richer. And costs like half the price of the entire cake for one slice. This is lighter, airy, and delightful. I suggest going at times when most people are working, or when the weather isn't that amazing as the wait time will likely be lesser. Or just wait a couple years. If Uncle Tetsu is still around, the line ups will be shorter (hopefully) and the purchasing process easier (hopefully)!!"}
{"text":"Lined up for 2 hours to try this highly coveted cheesecake. The cheesecake was good...but definitely not worth the wait or the hype. I actually found that I enjoyed the madelines more than the cheesecake although those still, were not worth the 2 hour wait. Felt like the business was inefficient with their staff and time which is why the wait is so damn long. Overall, good pastries but not worth the hype or wait. I was quite disappointed in the effort it took to get just good pastries. You can get equally good or better Japanese cheesecake around the city for no wait at all."}
{"text":"The wait was worth it! Very fluffy and moist. Not too sweet which I like. Will definitely come back if I visit Toronto"}
{"text":"Stayed across the street at the Marriott and was very happy to see that every time we walked by on the weekend mornings there was a minimal/no wait. Stopped in early on a Sunday morning, no line, walked right in, they take credit. $10 Canadian for one cheesecake that I say easily serves 4-6 ppl. I picked up one of their original cheesecakes. I have never tried a Japanese cheesecake and was excited! I cannot speak specifically to the authenticity of the cheesecake but it was very good. Light, fluffy texture when warm and denser, creamier texture when cooled. The overall taste is a less sweet cheesecake without crust (when compared to NY Style Cheesecake). Definitely worth a try if you're in the area.

Very pleasant experience for a first time Japanese cheesecake experience."}
{"text":"We're here again! Except this time, we're not here to line up for Uncle Tetsu's Japanese Cheesecake but to check out the new Uncle Tetsu's Japanese Matcha Cafe. As we all love Matcha so much, we must explore this new cafe!

Japanese Matcha Cafe is just right next door to Uncle Tetsu's Japanese Cheesecake. You won't miss it as there is always a long queue outside the Cheesecake Shop. We noticed that this time around, they added pylons around the store to control the lineup of customers.

Compared to the neighboring Cheesecake Shop, the Matcha cafe has a much quicker turnaround so there is only around 4-5 customers in the store at a time.  No long queue! WOOHOO!

As its name suggests, the Matcha Cafe serves everything Matcha! Soft Serve ice cream, Slushie, Shaved Ice and their signature Madeleine as well. Unfortunately they didn't have the Slushie on the day we went so we ordered the Matcha Soft Serve, which comes in Green Tea flavour, Vanilla flavour or a Twist of both flavours.  

The Madeleine station is up front and the oven is in the back of the store - a similar set up to the Cheesecake shop.

A Matcha flavored cheesecake is scheduled to come out in August.  So for all you Uncle Tetsu fans out there, be prepared to line up for the new cheesecake! We were lucky because they recently released a new Red Bean Green Tea Madeleine and it was available on the day we went!

Janet ordered a Green Tea Vanilla Twist Soft Serve ice cream in a cone.

The Green Tea Madeleine is again very rich in buttery flavour with a strong Green Tea taste, which balances out the heaviness of the cake.  However, they were quite dense and filling. The Red Bean version is packed with A LOT of Red Bean paste in the middle and it was very sweet compared to the one without Red Bean.

Be sure to check out our post about Uncle Tetsu's Japanese Cheesecake as well! Stay tuned for more! Have fun!"}
{"text":"I had no idea that I would be waiting close to two hours just for Japanese cheesecake. Was it worth it? The price..maybe. It's $10.00 flat for a 6\" original. The cheesecake itself is light and fluffy, not too sweet either. It reminds me a lot of the Chinese sponge cake. I think I'll wait until the hype is over and then maybe I'll go back!"}
{"text":"Don't understand why people line up for this.  Luckily there was no one when I went there on a Saturday morning. 

It lacks flavour and incredibly eggy.  The texture was a little better after refrigeration but still can't really taste cheese.  Don't tell me that's how it suppose to be.  I have made it better and I had them in other countries before."}
{"text":"*First review as an Elite*

So I had plan to get cheesecake after my stop at Canadian tire but this seem more appropriate as little treat as celebrate and what a treat it was


I kind of get the hype of this place. It definitey different from your tradional cheesecake which isnt a bad thing. I like different favours, taste and textures. This felt more like cheesy light and fluffy spongecake. I dont think  the word to use but seem about right.

I was tasty and different from what you expect but I like it. Also as far as line. It's warranted, it work the wait, the price isn't bad either. I probably try to revisit with a shorter line but again the wait has nothing to with my rating.

Also the cake didn't make it home I manage to eat it during the commute home on the ttc, it was that good"}
{"text":"Really like the cheesecake, not a fan of the line up! The buttery madeleines are so yummy! I wish you're able to buy several cakes at once!"}
{"text":"I've tried Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake only once, but I became a fan of this dessert right away. There is a hype about this for a reason. It is a bit pricey, but the unique taste of the cheesecake and packaging is too cute to resist. 

I wouldn't recommend getting it everyday (and spending 10 bucks plus tax for a small cheesecake) but it is a really good special occasion treat :) And sometimes, you need to treat yo self ;)"}
{"text":"Was going to a family dinner and the host requested that I bring the UT Cheesecake as I work downtown. I estimated I needed three for the entire dinner family. 

Reached there just after 4 and there about 10 people ahead of me. They 12 cheesecakes per batch and each batch come out 15 minutes or so. If you miss the batch, you have got to wait. I needed three and the cashier would not sell me three together. Bought one, went back to line and then bought another and then went back to the line. By that time there were 20+ people ahead of me. 

Next time we are having regular Cheesecake!!

The cheese cake is light, fluffy and not too sweet. If I had to guess the closest taste would be a pancake - a puffed pancake made in butter (lots) and added some sugar to it. Different than the Cheesecakes we were used to, but OK I guess. Good to try it once. If you like it, it meant for you."}
{"text":"Way over hyped. Not worth the wait. It must be the novice foodies in Toronto, as the same stores in Asia aren't busy with crazies lining up all day. The cheesecake is borderline bad. The cheesecake factory or even Carol's has it better. As for the Madeline. Chinatown has a similar product for half the price, no line up and tastes almost the same. Definitely not worth the time spent in line. If you happen by with no line up, then go in to satisfy your curiosity, otherwise, keep walking.

Now, if there was a blindfolded taste test of a Japanese cheesecake from T&T vs. Uncle Tetsu's and and other test of the Madeline vs. the similar cake at anyone of the Chinese bakeries, would our hyped up foodies distinguish between the two, and ultimately decide which tastes better? Perhaps the one with a line up at 8 check out counters could end up as the winner!"}
{"text":"The line is a little long but I think it was worth the wait. The Japanese cheesecake is so light and airy but also super rich! A little goes a long way which is perfect since you are limited to only 1 cheesecake a person. Right next door is Uncle Tetsu's matcha shop. I will have to try that next."}
{"text":"Three words: Sponge cake cheesecake. It's good however I would never line up for it. There's other places that also offer Japanese cheesecake (before Uncle Tetsu came to Toronto) so one can try branching out to try other options too. 

Uncle Tetsu prides themselves for providing a strict QA process and selling only \"perfect\" ones. Mine came without a logo branded on it and less fluffy than other ones I see on Yelp - what happened Uncle Tetsu?!"}
{"text":"Flat out bad.  It's a bland cheesecake with terrible customer service.  Cash only which is only communicated on purchase.  Rude staff.  Enjoy the wait."}
{"text":"It was okay. Has a lot of egg which makes it super fluffy but cause it to have a very strong egg taste."}
{"text":"I finally had the unfortunate chance to try out Uncle Tetsu's overhyped Cheesecake. I didn't wait in line, my friend did. I tried half a piece. This horrible excuse for a cheesecake tastes like a sponge. No I'm not saying that it's spongy, but rather that it LITERALLY tastes like a sponge soaked in dish soap. Don't fall for the hype.

Nice bag though."}
{"text":"I went on a random day, which is a Tuesday around noonish, so no line!! I have been in this city for a whole year and had yet to try this joint that was recommended by my boyfriend. The cheesecake was light, fluffy and really all sorts of goodness. I would definitely not wait in a long line for this cake, but I am willing to travel all the way downtown and shell out some cash for it. 

I strongly recommend going during non peak hours at a very random time when everyone is at work or something. Bottom line? I loved the cheesecake and would totally buy another one again. I would also eat the whole thing myself (that's right, idgf), but it's pretty rich as is...so nah. 2 slices in one sitting and I'm good"}
{"text":"This place is too overhyped.  The lineup for the cheesecake was exceptionally long and was not worth the wait."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake is really good (3.5 stars but I'll round up)... a different approach than even the \"light\" versions typical of North America.  It feels like a cross between a sponge cake infused with the flavour or a light cheese cake.  It definitely doesn't have the chew of a sponge cake just the visual... it break apart very easily.  Also not overly sweet like many North America palettes have gotten used to from deserts. I would buy one again... or try another flavour.

I've heard of the long lines and can only assume it's the same as the Krispy Creme craze.  I'm not the type to line up for something like this... It's not life changing.

:)"}
{"text":"No line up here!! 

Matcha Green Tea Soft Serve. I was looking forward to a creamy matcha flavoured treat, but I wasn't impressed with the ice cream. It was 'icy' and watery in flavour and texture. You can get it plain matcha green tea, or with Milk flavour twist. Twist gives you a more subdued matcha flavour. I didn't like it. I wouldn't try again unless they changed the recipe. 

I did however really like the Madelines. You can get plain matcha flavour or with red bean inside. I only got plain because it would be a 7 min wait to get with red bean. The flavour was good and you can taste the Matcha Powder. It was sweet without being too sweet. It actually tasted better chilled. It's buy 3 get one free, which is worth it. 

I did notice a sign \"Coming Soon, Matcha Green Tea Cheesecakes\" and a few new looking ovens. Although no line ups now \"Coming Soon, lots of line ups\""}
{"text":"It was an interesting experience, but definitely not worth the 45mins lining up. 

I was hoping to enjoy it more. 

My mom really enjoyed it though. She is not a fan of cheesecake, so the pound-cake like texture was very enjoyable for her. 

I found it a little bland."}
{"text":"I wondered why folks line up outside each day? Yesterday no lines and I wondered in to try this unique cheesecake...
Sad to say it's sad. No flavor and rubbery...dry. Not light or heavy..Japanese cheesecake done right can be very light and mousse.
This isn't either, of course since most folks in line are mostly young kids that probably never tasted great cheesecakes, I am not surprised.
The madeleines were simply spins cake with little flavor...
I can't imagine anyone visiting this place and going back for seconds, I certainly won't.  But then I have tasted good and great cheesecake and this one isn't even in the conversation.
Seems as though Torontonians have a low threshold for quality and greatness? 
Why? I can't answer that, all I can do is exercise my voting with my wallet. This shop while pleasant is a one and out."}
{"text":"I have been hearing numerous comments and praises from my friends for Uncle Tetsu's for a long time ever since they have opened the first location in Canada. They were glamouring about the cheesecake they make on a daily basis. They were not wrong about this place. 

Uncle Tetsu's is well known around the Asian communities around the world for the care and quality the take to prepare cheesecake, the Japanese way.  The cheesecake was very fluffy and smooth in every bite.  It was light and airy with the aroma of butter, eggs, and cheese in very bite. 

The lineup is something to consider as the cheesecakes take 45 min to bake and they only have enough ovens to bake a batch every fifteen minutes. So, expect to wait at least an hour , even on a normal afternoon. The wait is worth the quality, quantity, and taste for a cheesecake. It is a good experience, especially for people that have a sweet tooth. 

So, come check out Uncle Tetsu's if you are looking to satisfy that sweet tooth craving !"}
{"text":"I'm rating the 3 for the annoyance if having to wait over a hour for a 6\" cheese cake. Though the cheese cake is light and fluffy...they've gotta find a faster way to serve their customers.

I guess it could be a business strategy as people going in buy the other pastry offered because if you wait a hour, you might as well, right? Or maybe send one of parry to go next door to their spin off and buy the tart because there's no line up there.

I'm surprised they don't sell some Japanese pop because people would buy that too for a mark up....

Anyways . .I'd give it a 4 if they sped up the line (they've been open since March 2015, so plenty of time to figure things out).

Side note . Go first in the morning would min chance of a line up...."}
{"text":"Love the cake here and worth the wait! Get this and here is what I would suggest- eat half fresh and then put this in the fridge and eat the other half slightly cold. Love love !"}
{"text":"Boyfriend went in at 4.30pm on a Monday and only ended up waiting for 20 minutes! 

We tried the cheesecake and the madelines. The cheesecake definitely lived up to its hype of being fluffy and creamy, with the perfect melt-in-your-mouth texture. At $8.88 each for something 1 person can demolish and still be hungry, it is a bit expensive for myself, but I can definitely see why it's reasonable considering the rarity of the product here in Toronto. 

The madelines had a similar taste as the cheesecake, and is quite good. Be warned that they are extremely greasy and much heavier than the cheesecake. 

I am fairly impressed with the quality of both the products, and would come back for the cheesecake whenever I have the craving."}
{"text":"If you have the time and don't mind standing in line, it's definitely worth the wait. I was expecting to stand in line for an hour at least, so waiting 45 minutes was not bad at all. It's entertaining watching the staff, and once you get inside you can watch the ovens count down too. I was there on a friday around noon, and the line got longer while I was waiting. I imagine it's longer on weekends. 
Personally I love the cheesecake, since I don't like heavy desserts. This has the flavour of a new york cheesecake but fluffed up and much less intense. If you're looking for in-your-face cheesecake this is not it, but if you want a more subtle and fluffy cheesecake give it a try. The madelines are great too, and if you just want to buy those, you don't have to wait in line (give the a try if you want a tasty treat without waiting)."}
{"text":"Japanese cheesecake is like any other baked good - you can get the same with slight variations. The lineups here don't justify the result, you can get a larger japanese cheesecake elsewhere without the wait! Try asian groceries"}
{"text":"Lights and fluffy japanese style cheesecakes. Cash only, but not expensive at 10$ a cake. 
Greatest draw back is the huge line and no seating! It seems this issue will perpetuate to the matcha cafe next door. =/"}
{"text":"It took us an hour to get 2 cheesecakes! However, the taste worths the waiting time.. I've tried different cheesecakes, but this one is different! No toppings, no nothing, and thats what makes the taste original!"}
{"text":"Not worth the wait, waited for an an hour and fifty minutes. The cake is okay,it is unique and different from a standard cheese cake. I was really disappointed with the way they handle the customers. The staff is friendly; however, they very disorganized. They do a headcount and give you a token that guarantees if you will get a cake (close to closing time, 8:00pm-9:00pm for the line-up) and the rest are just SOL. Went with a group of friends expecting three cheesecakes. Received two and would have had to wait for the next batch for the last one. If you prorate the time you spend in line and the cost of the cake $10 and you're usually spending much more than that $10.

There are many things that could be done to address this issue, cakes made a head of time, the number system should be implemented throughout the day so people do not have to wait an excessive two hours in a line and can be given an estimated time which they can return to pick up the cake.

If you plan on going I advise you plan to share a cake and bring the best company possible."}
{"text":"What lines? Maybe there used to be queues in the past, but I've walked by several times over the past few days (week days) and there was never a queue. Cheese cake was $10 each and in general all items I considered overpriced. Cheesecake itself was interesting but not worth getting excited about."}
{"text":"Came by 30 mins before closing time. Only waited for 30 mins for the cheesecake (usually its a much longer wait) and also got to see uncle Tetsu in person. Texture of the cheesecake was so soft. Literally \"melted in your mouth\" kind of way. Tasted not too sweet. Its perfect for my liking."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, both the regular store and the green tea cafe. I love the cake itself as I'm not a fan of sweets in general, so it's the right amount of blandness to suit my tastes. I'm not a fan, however, of the continuous line that has been posted at the front since mid-March. The first time I went, the line took over two hours to get through. I'm a fairly patient person and I'll wait in any line once for something new, but I definitely will not wait again. It's cheap and tasty, but not worth standing in line for two hours. 

As for the green tea cafe, I went religiously after it opened. Every trip downtown was never complete without one of the green tea & red bean madeleines or a green tea & vanilla soft serve. It's a bit pricey, but still worthwhile as the flavour beats out the competition. Now that they have cheesecake, the line-up is growing and I'm once again not willing to wait in line. I do want to try the cheesecake, but perhaps once the line has shortened a bit.

In terms of service, the employees are very polite. They're attentive and cheerful. They're quick to apologize when there is a delay. It's a very nice atmosphere in the place and the smell of the baked goods is definitely inviting. 

tl;dr this place is great, the food is delicious, but the line isn't worth it. Occasionally, there is a short line. If you see it, RUN."}
{"text":"My son is in love with these cheesecakes.
It tastes best warm when it melts in your mouth. At room temperature, it doesn't have the same affect.

My favourite cheesecake is a ricotta/cream cheese. However I know lots of people hate the heaviness of traditional cheesecake, so if you're one of them but like cheese, the idea of cheese as dessert, then this is for you.

I'm reminded of the Chinese cakes with their sponge cake layers and how 'light' they are as a dessert.  The mango cake, the fruit cocktail layer vanilla cake. This cheesecake in this genre of desserts. So if you like those cakes, you should like this too."}
{"text":"over hyped. not worth the long waits.

yeah their cheesecake is good,but there are other places you can get equally or better cheesecakes in town. eg. Mon K  or Bakery Nakamura in JTown.

also had bad service from them.I get you're busy,but don't rush me out."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the line ups. Cheesecake tastes very similar to the T&T Japanese style cheesecakes that have been around forever, except it would be freshly made. The rule of one cheesecake per person is inconvenient too so if you wanted to get two you'd line up two times all the way at the back of the long line again.

Would much rather go to their next door matcha cafe which always is less of a line up and at the same time, they offer the matcha flavoured soft serve ice cream. Yum."}
{"text":"I mean...what can I say?? There is a reason people line up at this bakery and the one next door. I am literally ready to write the same review for both bakeries.

They are definitely over-rated, hyped up....but ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!

For the record, I am NOT a huge [regular] cheesecake fan, but these are just something else!!!

They are so fluffy, airy and light....and not too sweet either. As soon as you walk in, the smell just embraces your senses. I bought one box and returned a few hours later to buy two more. They are super inexpensive and so easy to indulge. One cheesecake is CAD$10, about $7.33 USD. The packaging is just so adorable as well. 

It is conveniently located right next to the Uncle Tetsu's Cheese Bake shop as well. I came on a Sunday morning, first around 9:30, then a second time around 11:30. Both times, there weren't any lines or other customers in the shop."}
{"text":"Cheesecake isn't bad and very reasonably priced. But I've had better and it's definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"The cheesecake, soft and spongy and melts in your mouth. 
A great delectable sweet for those who are adventurous! However, the lineup is a bit too much and I do recommend going in the wee early hours. 

I also do recommend stopping by the adjacent shop - the Matcha Cheesecake variety is amazing and the red bean addition adds some varied texture. 

Overall, I do recommend the original cheesecake and the red bean -green tea made lines as they complement each other. Just heed the line!"}
{"text":"Uncle Tetsu! Wow it's as fluffy as a cloud. This cake isn't flooded with piles of sugar or loads of icing. Soft as a feather just the way I like cakes. 

We walked all the way from Spadina and Queen on foot hoping there wasn't a big line tonight and got lucky, only a few patrons standing outside. $10 for each cheesecake and the limit is one per customer (sorry you can only pig out with one)."}
{"text":"With my propensity for one-trick food places, and unique food finds, there was no way I wasn't going to brave the line-up.

Things to know:

- They have 3 ovens going for the cheesecakes, capacity of 12 per oven, all on staggered times;  once you get inside, you can actually see the timer on each one
- Get there early to minimize waiting (at this point, I'd say 10-10:15am, they open at 11am), be part of that first batch of 12, and hope they have no rejects!  (We got there at 10:30am and waited 1.5 hrs)
- They are only allowing one cheesecake and one bag of 4 honey madeleines per person right now ($17.56, all-in)
- You can actually pretty reliably calculate how long you'll be in line by counting the number of people in front of you (take into account the whole line in the store, too)
- For good karma, if you are part of a couple or group, if you realize not all of you will be supplied with the current batch, be nice and let someone behind you in front of you, since you know you'll be waiting for the next one anyway
- For better karma, notice the tip jar at the cash register

As for the cheesecakes themselves, themselves, they're okay.  Not earth-shattering.  They're not traditional North American cheesecakes, and if you go in thinking they are, you're setting yourself up for a world of hurt.  Think of them more as super soft, light, moist, not-particularly-sweet sponge cakes.

The honey madeleines are denser and sweeter, and the honey does really come through, flavour-wise.

Would I go back?...maybe, once the novelty wears off, since I suspect one can experiment with adding something to them to make them a lot better.  To me, they seem like blank canvasses for potentially much great desserts."}
{"text":"The taste was really great. But would go there again? NOOOO. 

Both the cheesecake and the madelienes were pretty good. Was smooth, soft, rich in texture. But I had to WAIT 1.5HRS to get it. There is always a line up AND the people inside didn't seem to care. Also it's kinda disrespectful to keep people standing on the road- waiting while the staff just giggles away, some doing nothing.  

Assuming from the amount of people going there the store is always bz they should just get a bigger place and stop making customers wait on the road.

Tastely food
Good price
Awful. .just awful wait
Over hyped!!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake is fluffy, has a more eggy taste than cheese taste and is not as sweet as American cheesecake. As others have stated, it is more like sponge cake. 

I thought it tasted okay, I definitely prefer it over American cheesecake but it's definitely not worth the 2 hr wait. I would buy it again if there is no line up but in the meantime I'll pass."}
{"text":"If you're a matcha or cheesecake lover, you have to try this place. The cheesecake isn't too cheesy and is really fluffy. It's almost like a cheesecake pound cake so it isn't your typical cheesecake. The line didn't take too long for us --about 15-20 minutes. The honey Madeleine's weren't anything special to me."}
{"text":"Did you know...if you put a limit i.e. \"6 Per Customer Only\" for a sale item, people tend to buy 5-6 as opposed to if there are no limits while also marking it on sale, people will just buy 1-2? 

It's true. This logic was totally in effect at Uncle T's with their 1 cake/person rule, because it basically got all my friends and I to buy a Uncle Tetsu cheesecake until we had collectively bought everything on the menu. Despite the fact that I'm not even particularly fond of Japanese cheesecake. My brain was all like OH MAN SCARCITY. You need Japanese cheesecake in your life. NOW! 

Having tried all the desserts at Uncle T's, I'm basically a Japanese cheesecake connoisseur now. Here is how I would rank them:
1. Overnight-in-fridge Angel Hat: compared to Japanese cheesecake, it is fluffier and sweeter
2. Overnight-in-fridge Green Tea Japanese Cheesecake: more flavour than original flavour
3. Overnight-in-fridge Original Japanese Cheesecake
4. Green tea matcha ice cream
5. Fresh, not in fridge cakes in order of #1-3
6. Green tea madeleine: tastes like when a Soft Cookie met a Muffin 
7. Regular madeleine

Protip: You can actually order Japanese cheesecakes in certain Japanese restaurants i.e. Hapa Izakaya. Madeleines are also sold in Asian bakeries. And you can do all of this without lining up. Or having a limit per person."}
{"text":"If a Cheesecake and Sponge Cake from Japan immigrated to Toronto, Canada to make a baby, it would be Uncle Tetsu's Cheesecakes. 

I was drawn to these Japanese-style cheesecakes from this bouncy gif: http://i.imgur.com/KHbHUbk.gifv .. and knew I had to check it out on my recent trip to Toronto!

- You're not purchasing a slice, you are receiving a full (on the smaller side) cheesecake.
- $10 Canadian - debit or cash only
- Go on off-times (preferably near opening time or afternoon). You will wait an hour to purchase a cheesecake if you go in the evening, and possibly receive a notice that cheesecakes are sold out.
- There's a cafe side that sells only matcha-flavored treats. That line is much shorter (or no line at all), but go to the store side for the original cheesecake.
- 1 cheesecake per person

The cheesecake is really not even remotely close to a traditional cheesecake. It's subtly sweet, eggy, and fluffy (like a sponge cake or pancake). This emulsification technique makes the texture totally different. 

There's a food court across the street where Red Lobster is and have your cheesecake there, since there are no seats. This Cheesecake is To-Go only!

My cheesecake line-waiting date hates cheesecakes and he loved this. That's all I have to say!"}
{"text":"Try visiting the booth at union station market instead of waiting in this line. Unique taste and spin to the traditional cheesecake but not worth two hours of your life standing in line."}
{"text":"This is some of the best cheesecake I've ever had in my life. This is the famous Julie cheesecake from Japan that everyone raves about. My husband got us some from downtown and we were both blown away. We love how it's not super sweet and how it is so soft and light. It is delicious and we will definitely be back next time to get some more. Delicious delicious delicious"}
{"text":"the Matcha Cheesecake is so good! and I like how it's a bit smaller than the regular one so i can finish the whole cake all by myself within 2 days muahahaha
I actually like it chilled in the fridge as well as baking it for 5 mins at 350 degrees with the mini oven. 
the ice cream is nice and refreshing too, love the matcha cafe and anything green tea flavoured."}
{"text":"I really don't get the hype. I'm just thankful I didn't have to wait to two hours for that or I would've been really frustrated. I went on the first day they started opening early and waited about 15 minutes. Got two cheesecakes just so I wouldn't have to wait in line again and boy did I regret that decision. The cheesecake tastes like a slightly cheesy spongecake. Definitely tastes better when its cold but I would take a classic cheesecake any day over this
 I just really don't get it... Still had to eat them both, which was long and tedious. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"It`s really excellent.  The 2 hour wait was a bit annoying, but totally worth at least for the first time if you had never tried it.  On the other hand, I'm not sure I would want to do a 2 hour line every time I want that cheesecake.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I take the greyhound to work once a week, so one day I decided to show up early and see what all the fuss is about.

There was still a line by the time the store opened :P Turnaround was relatively short, at least that early in the morning. Perhaps it gets exceedingly long as the day goes on, I don't know. It was worth a $10 cake for me, anyway :P

The cake itself was worth the novelty wait, and I'd dare say that I can see myself being in the mood again one or two times a year. The cake is light, subtle, the kind of thing you want to eat slowly and thoughtfully with a good tea. The madelines are not as sublime but also tasty, cheap, and available without a lineup :P"}
{"text":"Not conventional Western cheesecake, obviously. It's an eggy, dry, heap filled with sugar- kind of like a powdered flan you buy from the dollar store. I know it's a new experience for most people but if you go to PAT you can buy a snack-sized version of this for $1 to try out. It tastes almost exactly the same- save yourself some time and money by doing exactly that."}
{"text":"I tried some of my friend's cheesecake that she waited over an hour for... it was pretty bland and I am glad I tried it before waiting in a huge line! Not worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Somehow, while walking by this place on a random Friday night, there was no lineup. Not a single soul - maybe it was shortly before closing time, I don't know. But we had to try it, after having seen thousands upon thousands of people line up in all sorts of weather conditions. Must be good, right? Wrong. 

Magically, we walked in, paid, and walked out with a ten-dollar wheel of \"cheesecake\". Time spent waiting? ZERO minutes. This is definitely not cheesecake. The cake looks like a sponge, and tastes like a Twinkie. Just less sweet and less creamy. Of course, I understand that Japanese cheesecake is different from the fatty version they serve in, say, New York. But, it was OK at best. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to try it again, almost certainly wouldn't spend $10 to do it, and for sure wouldn't wait one minute in line for it."}
{"text":"Love it.  The original, Angel Hat and Matcha Cheescake with Rea Beans are all delicious."}
{"text":"Very smooth cheesecake however the wait time for what you get is not worth it. I waited in line for over an hour to finish a cheesecake in less than 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Love these light and fluffy and eggy cheesecakes. Worth waiting in line for and hard not to eat all of it in one sitting."}
{"text":"bought the green tea flaour with red beans cheesecake...... it is cold........ it only tastes good when is warm or get colder inside the fridge...."}
{"text":"I say Uncle, you say TETSU. UNCLE - TETSU, UNCLE - TETSU. Usually the lineup for Uncle Tetsu is 1 to 2 hours long, but today when I went in at 3pm, there was no lineup and they had a stack of cheesecakes ready to be sold. The price for a cheesecake went up from $8 to $10! Wow, a whole $2 price increase!

The workers are working in a super hot environment, the cheesecake smell doesn't smell as strong as it did in the fall, spring or summer!

But oh boy, now I understand why the original flavour for Uncle Tetsu has such a long lineup compared to the green tea flavour! The original cheesecake flavour is rich and creamy and MELTS in your mouth! It was delicious!! 

I definitely recommend coming to Uncle Tetsu on the weekdays during office hours!"}
{"text":"Just happened to walk by on the way to dinner and saw a long line and decided to line up as well.  We actually got the matcha cheese cake.  The cheese cake was decent but nothing like a regular cheese cake.  It has a pound cake texture with a more cheesy taste than the regular cheese cake.  It was interesting worth giving it a shot."}
{"text":"I can't say it's great or even good. I am not one for hyped up places and would never stand in line. A coworker brought it in for us and everyone in the office agrees that it's pretty \"meh\". Agree with several other reviewers - the texture it nice, but it really doesn't taste like much."}
{"text":"The cheesecake they serve is definitely a novelty dish. It tasted good, but the unique part is really the texture. It is very systemized at the store so they have a bunch of pre made cheesecakes ready to take away. I liked the cheesecake, but I'm not sure I need to eat it again over traditional cheesecake."}
{"text":"I recommend ordering the Madeleine's over the cheesecake!

Order the Madeleine's with red bean inside. Those are very soft and do not have that \"gritty matcha\" taste. Still great even after a couple days. 

I still like the original cheese cake over the matcha cheese cake. The cheese cake also has a small amount of red bean at the bottom."}
{"text":"perhaps only good for the cheesecake but was extremely disappointed with the matcha latte. expected some quality from a Japanese-based franchise. the matcha latte I had was just steamed milk with about a teaspoon of matcha powder. definitely not worth $3.50."}
{"text":"Tried their cheesecake today and it was pretty tasty, nice and fluffy.
Price-wise I think it's fair. But I just wouldn't line up for this though. Still worth a try. But was not too Wow-ed by the cheesecake."}
{"text":"Best part of coming to Toronto is spending time with my BFF! He always takes me to try new desserts since I have the biggest sweet tooth ever. 

First there's no parking....we paid $10 to park in a private lot and walked a block. The line didn't seem long but it took us 45 minutes to get our cheesecake. 45 minutes in the freezing cold seems more like an eternity! Plus only ONE cheesecake per person. Have some games on your phone and time will pass by more quickly. PS wifi sucks. 

The cheesecake is light and fluffy. Not too sweet. Our cheesecake was still hot when we got it. First bite it didn't taste cheesy at all....it was more egg flavour and had the texture of cake not quite fully cooked. The next day the cheesecake taste way better.... More cheese flavour and a bit more dense texture. A cheesecake cost $10 and 4 Madeline's was $6.36. Reasonably priced. 

Overall it's the closest to Japanese cheesecake you'll get here in Canada. Oh there's a separate lines for regular cheesecake and matcha cheesecake."}
{"text":"If you like JAPANESE Cheesecake, this is the place to get it! If you're expecting a creamy cheesecake, this is not it. The price is reasonable ($10) for an entire cake, but the line up was crazy when I went. I think I waited for over an hour outside!"}
{"text":"here's another review about uncle tetsu! I'll keep it short:

TIME I CAME
I came here on a warm and sunny wednesday at 4:45pm, there were maybe 20 people in front of me. From the time I stood in line to finished paying was just under 1hr.  Wasn't as bad considering that when I left the shop, the line up had doubled.

WHY I CAME
I came because of the rave; I wanted to know what it tasted like. Even if people say it's not good, I want to know what \"good\" meant.

WHAT I EXPECTED
I'm a foodie so I'm adventurous and like to try new foods. I never had jap cheesecake before so I can't compare to other variations of japanese cheesecakes out there. Like Lisa K mentioned in her review on 4/2/2015 (scroll below) ,it's like going to a concert for a band you never heard of before- it's not fair to critique.

But this is what I know: I bought it knowing it would be lighter, less sweet and nothing like american cheesecakes.

WHAT I THOUGHT
I never had a cake with this texture before- it's so fluffy and spongey. Honestly, it takes just like eating whipped egg whites, it's that airy. I taste a lot of eggs (saw them make the batter: they use unsalted butter, 3% milk, commercial honey and some other stuff), and it's not sweet. Although it's light, don't be fooled, it's actually very rich! I only had a few bites, thank goodness the cake is only 6\", I don't think I could eat much more. My mom and my boss likes it, so I guess it's your preference of what you think is a good cake/cheesecake. Personally, I don't like rich foods, so jap cheesecake is not for me. On the plus side, the cake isn't sweet, and the cashier is very cheery and affectionate."}
{"text":"The matcha store beside the original one had quick service while the original one had a very long line. There was a limit to one cheesecake per person. The matcha cheesecake was very good. The matcha hid the cheese a little more which was good because I don't really like cheese cake because the ones I usually tried are dense but these were moist and spongy. The original cheesecake was good as well but I preferred the matcha one more. If you like cheesecake then I think you should get the richer cheese tasting ones like angel hat. The original cheese cake had a light cheese taste that wasn't heavy and very light. It had the same texture as the match version. Overall everything was nice except for the line. The price for each of them is $10 in total. (tax included) The size of the cheesecakes were the size of your hand stretched out and add 2-3 cm more. (this is around the size because it depends on your hand size as well."}
{"text":"Last Friday, I waited in line for two hours in the rain for the cheesecake. Luckily, I was with good company and I didn't wait for three hours lol 

The first time you put it in your mouth with a couple of bites, it's weird. I didn't like it because it's really different from the cheesecake we are used to here. I was expecting it to be somewhat similar, but then once I ate it, it's actually pretty good. 

Personally, I think the cheesecake is really good. It wasn't too sweet, but it was sweet enough. It was so soft and moist even eating it two days later! My mom thought it was worth the two hours wait, whereas my dad hated it! So really, you just have to try it out and see for yourself. Personally, I really like it, but I don't think I'd wait for two hours again just for another one lol

However, once the hype dies down, I don't mind going back for more. OH, and I'm excited to try the angel hats! So, I'll def go back for that^^ 

I would suggest to wait for the hype to go down, which might be in a month or two. Eventually it'll die down, so you will get to try it soon :)"}
{"text":"I've heard all about Uncle Tetsu's - as well as seen all the viral videos on Facebook. When I found out that the Uncle Tetsu's in Toronto was in such a central area, I put it on the \"To-Do\" list. I wasn't super interested in the cheesecake itself, but more on their cheese tarts! I'm a huge fan of cheese tarts after having them in Japan two years ago, so I knew I had to try them.
 
There are actually two storefronts, right next to each other. The cheesecake one had a long winding line in front of it. The cheese tart one had no line - we walked right in. They offer three flavors - original, chocolate, and matcha. We opted for the buy 5, get 1 free deal since we couldn't decide which ones we would like more. They pack it up for you in this sturdy box. It survived the trip back to our AirBnB, the drive from Toronto to Niagara, and then the drive from Niagara back to Detroit.
 
We did a taste test - we unexpectedly stumbled onto the Pablo a block away - and came up with different results. I liked the ones at Tetsu's better, but BF liked the Pablo crust more as it was more flakey and softer. The matcha tasted really good cold and straight from the fridge - but the chocolate tasted better warm or room temperature.
 
Honestly, you can't go wrong with the cheese tarts here. They're delicious!"}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5 Stars.
We came here right when they opened so we didn't have to really wait- maybe around 20 mins? People started lining up really quickly after us leading out of the store. Sadly it was raining outside but luckily we were dry inside. The staff are pretty quiet, not much interaction with the customers minus the cashier. We ordered 1 cheesecake and 1 bag of madelines. The cashier didn't really pay attention/listen carefully enough to our order and just processed it. Even when we tried to correct her she didn't pay any mind to us and got us our cakes and rushed us out. I did feel like she was a bit rude...but I really think that was how she is. 

Now onto the actual baked goods we got:
Madelines: Tasty, reminded us of corn bread minus the corny bits.
Cheesecake: Fluffy and very airy. Tasted more like cake with a hint of cream cheese. If you are a fan of new york style cheesecake do not expect the same from here. Their cakes are very light. Imagine a cheesecake that resembles Aero chocolate- it melts in your mouth.

The service: I can't really say much about it...can come off like rushing.
The price: pricey I suppose, I can't really compare with other Japanese bakeries.
The quality: they bake everything fresh.

Verdict: I can't say we would come back, it was good but definitely not worth the hype. If you are willing to wait for their cakes then I say it's worth trying once. But to me the wait is not worth it. It all boils down to personal preference, if you like regular rich cheesecake or fluffy light cheesecake."}
{"text":"Their cheesecake tastes like a creamy, cheesy crossbreed between a pillow and a marshmallow. It's good, but I don't think it was worth the hype."}
{"text":"After being first to line up starting at 10 am, I was served quickly with an order of one cheesecake and a bag of madeleines when they opened. Make sure you bring cash. The staff were nice enough to save a cheesecake for someone in line to get cash.

The cheesecake itself was different compared to new york style but did not quite live up to the hype. The madelines were similar to the cheesecake except more like a cupcake. It was definitely worth a try but probably won't go back in a while. If you were to surprise someone with the cake, I would recommend you start lining up at 10 am on a weekend. People may line up earlier on a weekday.

Tips are show up early to avoid the 2 hr wait and bring cash. You may not be as lucky for the store to save a cake while you run to get cash."}
{"text":"The matcha soft serve was good, but for the price I would have appreciated a few more swirls. I couldn't really taste the matcha in the Madeleine, but the red bean filling was delicious.

I'd go back again for the soft serve, if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"My take is that it's overrated, given the long lineups... however for people who love Matcha flavoured things it's not bad. Their madeleines were overpowered by the taste of butter. I also didn't like that you can't even pay with a credit card.
Ambiance isn't great, but again its not a a place to sit down anyways. 
Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"My first time trying Japanese cheesecake was here. There's always a line here because they are so popular. The cakes are light, fluffy, and super cheesy! The packaging from Uncle Tetsu's is cute, too. Everything is made fresh everyday right in front of you!

My boyfriend and I got the classic cheesecake and one of the mini honey cakes called \"Madeleine\". Both were super yummy!!

They only allow one cheesecake per person in line, so keep that in mind if you come here!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake here is light, tasty and not too heavy.  We got lucky that we did not have to wait for hours like many people since the cheesecake is good but would not be worth waiting hours on the street for a taste."}
{"text":"Line up is redic. Madness. Worth it. Every. Time. 

Hard to tell if i enjoy it because I waited 2 h in line or that it's really phenomenal Japanese cheesecake. I'm going to go with the latter!"}
{"text":"Meh. It's okay. It's very plain, light and fluffy. I made a coulis to go on top of it - which is easy and makes it easier to eat! If you like NY style cheesecake - you'll probably feel the same way I do. We had been wanting to try it to see what all the fuss was about. Good service. Clean shop. Don't wait in line for this stuff. Damn you, Hype!!!"}
{"text":"Uncle Tetsu's Japanese cheesecake is the perfection of a cheesecake- a  lighter fluffy texture, and sweetness that's not over the top- but just right. When I had gone to Japan, I tried out different varieties of Japanese cheesecake, but Uncle Tetsu's was still the best for me.  Their recipe also has few simple ingredients- a sign of perfection! 

Their cheese tarts are very good, and come in different flavors. I've only tried their original which was really good. I am sure all their flavors are great based on the quality of what I've tried so far."}
{"text":"I guess I can see the hype. This location is super convenient because there's so much foot traffic in this area and my Airbnb was next to it! I wish they were able to make more batches at once because one order is a bit much work for me to get back in line and when there is a line, the line is long!! 

You really have to make time to wait in line but it actually doesn't take too long when they have the batches ready. I had a sample when my friend bought it back to the states when she visited and let me tell you it taste 10x better when it's fresh. 
The consistently is there but it's so good when it's super fresh. We literally ate that whole cake in one sitting! But don't be too quick to judge, the cake want even that big LOL

A must try when you're in Canada!"}
{"text":"It's still a great Japanese experience with great cheesecake in the Japanese style

It is not New York style cheesecake

No line ups too worry about anymore and he has the place next door doing matcha baked goods as well which is smart so you can drop at $20 at each store before going home

Take a good look at the ovens and you will know why service can be slow as you can only cook so many at a time

Then you laugh your head off when the girl brands the cake right before your eyes"}
{"text":"Japanese cheesecakes are very different from western cheesecakes. The texture is unique, like a softer and airy-er version of a pound cake, not dense and sticky. Taste-wise, also nothing like the western version. Way less sweet, which allows one to appreciate the other flavors, notably from the egg, a lot more. Pretty good value too, ~$8 per original cheesecake I believe? Cheaper than grocery store cheesecake for sure. Just don't underestimate the lightness or smaller size - there is over 1000 calories per entire cheesecake, so share with others!

Downsides to this location are the ridiculously long lines outside (so cold) and lack of seating."}
{"text":"Do you all see that hella long line to line up to go into uncle tetsu's?! First the Japanese cheesecake, which tasted like regular ol' spongecake to me... and now the matcha craziness. 

I passed by bay and dundas randomly and saw that there was no line protruding out the door. Hey, that means it's now or never. With only 2 other people in front of me, I lined up to try one of my favourite treats: a matcha soft serve. One matcha soft serve is $3.99, which is not cheap but not crazy expensive either. The soft serve came shortly after payment and to my surprise, it was not the creamy smooth matcha taste that I've come to know and adore. This matcha was much more.. blunt. No smoothness to it at all, but there was no denying that the matcha taste was there. It was a good cone but not amazing. If you've heard of wooffles and cream located in markham, their matcha ice cream is a gazillion times better and I promise you that you will have a more enjoyable time there. 

Also, the store itself is tiny and FILLED with Japanese ladies baking intensely, pouring matcha mix here and there. The amount of people and the tiny area makes the inside of this store very humid, so avoid if you're claustrophobic. 

I'm glad I tried it, but I won't be back again soon, especially if the line goes out the door."}
{"text":"The matcha ice cream is by far the best I ever had!! Although the texture of the cheesecake is incomparable, the matcha Madeleine were better treat."}
{"text":"Oh my the cheesecake was delicious and heavenly. I waited for 50 mins on a Thursday midday. The store itself is amazingly tiny so I couldn't bring my son in to see them at work. nevertheless, it was fun watching the ovens knowing when your cheesecake was ready. I purchased the cheesecake that came to $10 after taxes (CASH ONLY), and 4 Madeleines. The madeleines were mediocre however, they had a buttery corn bread taste. I guess the cheesecake is where its at. Sadly we could only get 1, as it is posted outside (Limit 1 per customer!!) I personally waited to eat the cheesecake by cooling it in the fridge for a few hours, even the day later it was still so moist and soft. Great taste that leaves you wanting so much more. And for such a plain cheesecake with no additional flavours like cherry or blueberries that we are used to here, it was a delicious surprise. 10/10 definitely recommend to anyone who is a cheesecake fan or anyone who likes desserts. Please try this place once, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Finally tried the infamous Uncle Tetsu Cheesecake after several months of hype for this place. Didn't have to wait too long for this place, just 20 minutes and went on a Saturday evening so I didn't mind waiting. It's $10 for the cheesecake and it was definitely a cool experience seeing it made right before your eyes. It was made fresh and it was quite good. My preference is usually a more sweeter and flavorful but I did enjoy this japanese cheesecake. But, I don't think it lived up to the hype generated by many people. Some people waited 2 hours and I don't believe it's worth the wait. When I brought this home, my family simply loved it and I think it's best served when it's cool rather than hot. Overall, it was good to finally tried this place and I would go back to get some more and try some of their other bakery items."}
{"text":"FINALLY! It's about time I tried these cheesecakes, especially after all that hype.  I casually walked by the shop around 5pm on a Tuesday evening and was surprised there wasn't really a lineup. I didn't plan going here so I really wasn't expecting much, afterall people say it's not worth the wait. I waited less than 5 minutes and was pretty happy about that! And even in those five minutes suspense was building up lol.

They were pretty good! I have never tried anything like it and would say they were worth the wait (under 10 minutes for sure). They were so fluffy and were melt in your mouth. Great balance of cheesiness/creaminess/egginess (totally made that up). I'm not a fan of overly sweet desserts and these cheesecakes were the perfect sweetness.

$10 is fair and it's best if you share it (or indulge it all if you want). If you still haven't tried these things, what are you waiting for? There's no lineups anymore :)"}
{"text":"Smells awesome. Everything is made fresh. Wait was 1.75 hrs.
6\" cheesecake $8.88+hst (1 per customer)
4 madelei $6.66+hst (buy 3 get one free)

Since waiting for that long, I got both madelines and cheesecake. I never got to taste the Madelines as my mom ate all of them. The cheesecake was really good. soft light and the right amount of creaminess. Better served cold. Although smaller than the cakes I am normally used to, it lasted for a week and a bit with my family.

The reason it takes so long is that there is only one oven with 36 cheesecake capacity and 45 minute bake time. 12 cakes for every 45 minutes.

Trying it once is great but I dunno if I can take the line-up nextime"}
{"text":"The Japanese-style cheesecake was fine, but not worth the wait when it first opened.

I did enjoy the green tea madeleines next at their coffee shop however."}
{"text":"Personally didn't think the cheesecake was worth the wait. Alot of people love it though but I didn't."}
{"text":"Seeing that there was barely a line, we decided to give this newly opened cafe a try. You can smell a pleasing buttery matcha aroma once you enter the shop. They had quite a variety of matcha desserts, including smoothies, bingsu, and madeleines.

 I ordered a milk & matcha mixed soft serve in a cup ~$4. It was refreshing and delicious. The milk was slightly sweet and the matcha had a slight bitterness which balanced each other out. 

The only problem was that they barely filled even half the cup for the price paid. Definitely ask for more if you pay them a visit to prevent disappointment."}
{"text":"The cake itself was alright, not 1.5 hours good - more like 45 minutes wait time good. Had to jump on the band wagon and try this place out. 

Got there on a Thursday afternoon around 4.00pm. The line was already long, waited a total of an hour and a half. The people in the line however were not the nicest, they were a bit pushy (it was drizzling) Once inside it was warm and the smell feels so comforting, love the exposed kitchen where you can see them making everything. 

The cake was hot out of the oven and wrapped in cheese cloth and into the box, the packaging and bag was really cute and yeah the stamp on top was also really really adorable. However, since it came out hot I was not a fan that when it cooled down there was beady drops of condensation inside the box. 

It was soft and not very sweet - almost plain and boring by itself. (I added strawberries to mine at homeand it made it 100x times better) The honey mandelines were again plain tasted just like a muffiny butter cake. Hopefully when they make other items and flavours it will be better

PRO TIP: they post images of the lineup on their twitter so you can see ahead of time how long it is! and its cash only"}
{"text":"Hey Yelp? I know, I said I was done with you but... I had uncle tetsu cheesecake a few weeks back...

I'm still thinkin about it.

I made a video about this cake on my YT channel.. I actually captured the first time I tasted this rare delicacy. I never knew I could let myself be so.... so vulnerable on camera.  

I personally never understood why cheesecake needed crust, this cake does not. It's self-crusted. And I love how they burn Uncle tetsu's face on top of every cake. My friend stabbed right between the eyes. He stabbed so hard the knife went through the box into my kitchen table! That table is a family heirloom! I'll see him hanged for this!! *hairflip*   

Oh yeah, so when u try the cake, you'll need a glass of milk or water cuz there;s no sauce involved. Things get pretty dry so stay hydrated.  Might wanna bring some nivea face moisturizer too just in case. Better yet get some aloe vera juice cuz u can poor that all over your face and into your mouth and drink it.  Might wreck your shirt thooo

Some say that it's not worth the wait or the price but I say... good for them, shorter lineup for me! so MEH!

5 stars!"}
{"text":"wow!! first time having Japanese cheesecake after seeing all those jiggly cakes on Facebook and Instagram! it was just so conviently there at union during my commute. it was simply amazing, just as good as it looks. staff were super friendly and quickly served me a fresh cheesecake in a really neat box. I can't wait to tell my friends and family about it! and I thought new York cheesecake was the best!"}
{"text":"A family friend gifted us with an Uncle Tetsu cheesecake. Raising to a 4-star given changes in our family vote :) on the number of stars. :)"}
{"text":"I went back in May to test out the cheesecake everyone was talking about. I waited in line for 1hr 20 minutes. Upon reaching the door, you can smell the baked goods. They produce 12 cheesecakes every 15 minutes and they only had 3 ovens. You were only allowed 1 cheesecake.

The cheesecake itself was soft and light. It wasn't too sweet. I find it much tastier to eat it when warm. It was good but I don't think I would wait in line for over an hour again for it. I went back in July during lunch hour and the line was about 40 minutes. It gets busy in the afternoon when people get off work. I was surprised to see that they were now open at 7 am. Good for the early risers!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and it was close to closing time and luckily the line was pretty short. I really don't get what the hype is. It's not amazing nor is it terrible. I definitely think it's worth eating the cake when it's COLD. Do not eat it warm or it will just taste like spongy eggs."}
{"text":"It's worth waiting for 20 minutes, not the hour and a half. Mildly sweet, fluffy cheese cake, it's nothing like NY cheese cake. It's better hot than cold. That being said, I did finish off a cake by myself in a night."}
{"text":"This one star is the minimum star that I gave.
Toooo long waiting time and don't deserve to wait for more than 5 minutes.
The cakes are so-so, not fantastic as people always saying. 
Incredible long lining up."}
{"text":"Matcha Green tea cheesecake has a subtle but distinctive flavor. Slight sweetness and ultra fluffy.   I went on a week day at noon and there wasn't a line up. Go at earlier times to avoid the Long line up."}
{"text":"I'm not a big cheese fan but I'm game for good cheesecake that doesn't taste like cheese. This cheesecake is very different from New York cheesecake. It's very fluffy and light.not sweet at all either. You must try them if you have never had them. Cash or Canadian debit card only. And your limited to one cheesecake at a time. I only had to wait 6 mins to finish cooking and it was warm by the time I got back."}
{"text":"The cheesecake here is definitely delicious here. 

I actually never have to wait in this stupid line at this store for a cake ever.

WHY? u ask me why i tell you why i walk down the street to their sister store @ 191 Dundas Street W (Uncle Tetsu's Angel Cafe) 3-5 minute walk. They always have a whole bunch of cakes ready and also another assortment of cakes to choose from too. I always feel bad for people lining up here this is not the only store. The cafe down the street is never busy for take out customers. If you choose to sit in thats another story in itself. 

The cheesecakes are delicious here. Good pricing excellent working staff."}
{"text":"Taste great and there are two door. One for cheese tart and the other one is for cheese cake . Both taste delicious ;)"}
{"text":"So I FINALLY just had a chance to try out their (for reasons beyond my knowledge) infamous cheesecake.  While the texture is spongy and soft like a memory foam pillow, the taste is (what I can only imagine) likewise my analogy.  My brother waited half an hour (although I know people who's waited up to THREE HOURS) to buy one cheesecake, and four madeleine tarts.  Can you say regrets?  I had similar style cheesecake like this when I was in Japan by a place called Uncle Rikuro, and man oh man, Uncle Tetsu does not hold the slightest candle to it.  I'm not saying it's better because I had it in Japan.  It was simply better because it actually had luscious cheesecake flavour, with the combo of the most airy texture that tasted what I can only imagine, like a cloud.  Save your time of waiting in line, people.  I'm sure your time will be more useful elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is simply wonderful. I went for the first time with a friend yesterday, and must say that I will definitely be back again, next time I'm in Toronto. The cheesecake is fabulous, and the staff were friendly and pleasant. The line was fairly long, but for very good reason (it didn't take very long). 

I definitely recommend coming here for some delicious treats - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The lineups for this place has been quite ridiculous! 
But my friend had gotten some for me and left the cake and cupcakes in the fridge cooled down. 

I had thought it was quite mediocre, especially compared to other asian bakeries near by. 

However, I came here and lined up for myself the other evening when the lines weren't too long and got a cake (cash only $10). When it is just freshly baked, and eaten right away, it is absolutely delicious! and unique! Kind of eggy in taste and texture like the chinese egg tarts or something else like it. 

It is scorchingly hot inside the bakery getting out though, so beware. 

I would come back here if the wait in line was less than 20 minutes. Hopefully the new addition and expansion next-door will help them with meeting the demand!"}
{"text":"If you have never had it before, it's good to experience the fuwa-fuwa texture and flavour. I recommend letting the cake chill over night as all cheesecakes need to have a chill/resting period or else it'll taste bleh right after you get it from the store."}
{"text":"The hype is still on after 3 months.  I got a taste of one cheesecake a month ago when i lined up with a colleague after work on a weekday.  The weather wasn't super warm back then, so probably why the lineup on a Wednesday night wasn't too bad, but we still lined up for around 1 hour and 20 minutes.

The wait wasn't as painful as i thought it would be, i guess it was because i had company, so I recommend anyone who would want to try this cheesecake to lineup with a friend to kill time.

One of their staff is super nice, she would come out every 20-30 minutes to count heads and update the customers patiently waiting in line how much longer it would take from the spot you are at.

Once inside the shop, I was super impressed, the bakery was HOT on a day that was around 8 outside and every cheesecakes were made to perfection.  They have very high standards, so every cakes go through strict quality control before they put the stamp on and package it then sell to customers!

Once home, the cheesecake is fantastic, I think I would prefer eating it hot (fresh or microwaved a little), but the cheesecake is still good eating at room temperature!  It was very soft and not sweet, which was perfect for me!  For just $10, you are buying a well-known Japanese cheesecake from a known brand in Asia!  Was it really worth the 1.5 hour wait?  Not really, I would say it is worth a 20-30 minutes wait.  Once the hype dies down a little, I will for sure to grab another one!"}
{"text":"I got in line for this place not really knowing what I was in for but knowing I love cheesecake and if there is a line up it must be good. You can only buy one per customer, otherwise you have to go to the back of the line, and there is no flavour options it is just a whole cheesecake or none. So obviously I bought one and have no regrets. At first it was a little different to get used to the texture (it is like angel food cake meets cheesecake) but I quickly realized it was delicious and I really enjoyed it and went back again my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Not worth the 2 hour wait.
Don't be fooled by the long line, that's how we got tricked.  

Currently this place only offers cheesecake and madeline.  Madeline was pretty good, considering the amount of butter that goes into it.  You can check out how it's made and the massive amount of butter that goes in through the store front window.  Cheesecake is very airy like you're eating mascarpone. Because it's so light, you can eat the whole thing in seconds... which angers you more because of the long wait to get it.  Also, there's a catch.  One cheesecake per person, which in a sense is fair since everyone is waiting so long."}
{"text":"YES! I am a matcha AND Japanese cheesecake fanatic. 
So when I heard about Uncle Tetsu in Toronto, I could not wait to give it a try. 
There are two stores right beside each other: matcha themed and the original one. The original one always seems to be crowded. But because I wanted to try a matcha cheesecake, I did not have to wait in line (and I went there on Sunday morning when everyone is still asleep haha)

There is no table, only take out. And cash or debit only.
In terms of cheesecake, there are two kinds but the same price. I opted one with red bean inside (matcha and red bean are perfect pair to go with).

I liked how the cake was not too sweet and slightly bitter with matcha flavor. It was a perfect balance between sweetness and bitterness. If you are looking for a sweeter or richer (or both) cheesecake, go for the original one!
For those who have never tried Japanese cheesecake, it is known for being soft, moist, and light. SOOO good :) 

Overall, great cheesecake and this place is the only place in Toronto specialized in Japanese cheesecake as far as I know. I have not tried the original one so I do not know if it is worth a wait to get it."}
{"text":"Make sure you show up early to this place or you are very likely apt to end up in a line up, and with a limited amount of ovens for these people to produce these special , very unique cheesecakes, sometimes it takes a bit for the line to move. 

However what you can expect is that for 10 bucks, you are going to get a very cool cheesecake whos flavor and texture is totally its own thing. Its still a cheesecake but really not as tart, or as sweet as a new York style, also the texture is quite strange... uhhhhh, say its like soft scrambled egg texture... or like the fluffiest omelette texture ever. Its definitely a neat thing to try and if I lived downtown i'd probably be getting one every week. Give it a try its super cool and yummy!"}
{"text":"The cakes are okay--not so sweet, just like how the typical Japanese desserts should be. Price is very affordable, but cash only. I don't think it's worth two hour of wait time, though. My bf got it for me just as a surprise, don't think I would be willing to wait in line for it myself."}
{"text":"There's still a big line at this place but I'd say it's worth the wait.

We waited for about 45mins which was actually a short wait for this place. Talking to people in line this place still averages over an hour wait in line.

You can only get one cheesecake per person and a few madeleines. The cake is $10 which at the time thought it was a bit over priced.

After eating the cheesecake I was really surprised and happy with coming to Uncle Tetsu. I'd describe the cake as closer to a typical fluffy cake, that taste's like a cheesecake. It's lighter than a regular cheesecake which I really enjoyed. The cake was also fairly filling for two people so the price didn't bother me afterwords.

You may not find this places cheesecake better than a regular cheesecake but trying a different style is always worth it to me."}
{"text":"You have to go early in the morning when they open to avoid the line-ups later on in the day. $10 CDN for an average cheesecake which is just okay-tasting. Nothing that tweaked my 'wow' factor. Just a temporary hype which I don't know how long it'll last."}
{"text":"I just recently got to try the cheesecake here. Lol. My friend actually waited in line for about an hour (aww) and gave it to me as her Christmas gift! 

I couldn't try it right away but once I got home I heated it up by oven for a bit. While it is nice warm, I actually found I prefer it cold. I got the original one and it's pretty soft and spongy. I would definitely try it again but probably wouldn't get it myself if I had to wait 1-2 hours. Maybe like 15-20minutes at most? Over hyped tbh."}
{"text":"The first time I've had Uncle Tetsu's was in Australia and I'm just waiting for the day they open a branch in Boston or New York.  It is just so so good.  And since we were on vacation and I was waiting with friends, the wait was not a problem at all between random convos and games of Heads Up (besides, didn't have to wait in line in Australia, so I guess it's about time).

Food:
-Cheesecake: This is the only cheesecake that I can see myself finishing in one sitting.  It is not your typical American cheesecake, which are usually too sweet, too dense, and too decadent for you to enjoy the entire cheesecake from the first bite to the last.  They had just run out of their last batch, so we had a fresh set, which was warm, light, fluffy, but was just a bit too wet.  The texture was also not as smooth as usual since the warmth meant more separation within the cake.  We left it in the fridge to finish tomorrow - and that was the best decision ever.  Chilling it made it denser and while the cheesecake was still light, it became just a touch more smooth and creamy as everything melded together.  It's exactly what I would imagine a ice cream version of the cheesecake would be like.
-Madeleine: Their madeleine was in a cupcake form and was denser and sweeter than others, but still very very spongy and a tiny bit sticky.  I really liked the near bready, but ever so slightly crumbly texture.
-Cheese Tarts:  Not the stars of the show.  Next door, they were selling cheese tarts (regular and matcha) without a line, so we had one of each to try.  The cheese tart was a bit too cheesy, but it was much better than the matcha one (which might have been too warm as the filling keep oozing out).  The crust was also not as flaky or airy as the regular egg tarts from Chinatown.

Recommendations:
-Wait in lines with friends who are good at waiting in lines and are willing to play Heads Up.  
-Chill half the cheesecake to enjoy the next day (left outside, it lasts 12 hours and, in the fridge, 3 days)
-Guard it with your life because your \"friend\" might eat the last bites (aka the middle part of the cake with Uncle Tetsu's face stamped on it) without you..."}
{"text":"I lined up for 1.5 hours . The cheese cake was light, fluffy, not too sweet. Almost like a warm milk fluff pudding. It was interesting and good...  But not great. I wouldn't line up for it again.

As for the Madelines, I'd prefer the French version baked as a cookie over this muffin version any day."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I waited 2 hours for a cheesecake lol, but it was worth it. There isn't anything else quite like it; fluffy and melts in your mouth. Since then, the wait time has dwindled down to 20 minutes, which is great, because that's around the time they need to bake a cheesecake, so it's always oven-fresh when you get it. If you feel like trying the green-tea variety instead, the matcha place next door has it and you can avoid the line."}
{"text":"I stopped by twice. The first was before they released the matcha cheesecake, so I grabbed a couple of the regular matcha madeleines. I thought they were very buttery with the perfect hint of matcha.

The second time I stopped by with the sole purpose of grabbing a cheesecake. The lineup wasn't that bad. I had to wait 10 minutes while the cheesecakes were baking in the oven. I also grabbed a few of the red bean Madeleines. I was actually a bit disappointed in the cheesecake. The original is MUCH better. It tasted good, but the matcha masked the taste of the cream cheese, so it felt more like eating a matcha cake, not CHEESEcake. It's worth trying if there's no line. My favourite were the red bean madeleines though. The matcha was very flavorful and the red bean filling made for a nice gooey center. I will definitely grab a couple more of those the next time I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Fluffiness is all remember. I was lucky enough to pass by at a time when the line-up was minimal so I was able to get a cheesecake within 10 minutes. Took the cake and went down the street to eat it by the Nathan Phillip square. While the first few bites were good, it got heavy quickly. We shared a cake by 3 and were not able to finish it. Partly also due to the fact that none of us 3 were fans of cheesecake to begin with. Still worth a taste!"}
{"text":"Delicious but definitely not worth the wait. If there is no line I would highly recommend this place I personally like to eat the cheesecake after being refrigerated with some added toppings, over rated but good!"}
{"text":"Fluffy..Creamy..great cheesecake that they sell cold ($8) and hot ($10). I went around 11AM on a Friday and there was no line which was fantastic. This was my second time trying this cheesecake. The first time I did not enjoy it so much however the second time around was a hit. It's everything you'd want in a cheesecake and it certainly does not have a very powerful cheese flavour too it. For those who are not cheesecake lovers..give this one a shot and you may just start loving it. 

Only negatives to this place is the limit of cheesecakes you can buy..cash only and I had wanted the cold version however since they didn't have any cold left they made me pay $10 for a hot cheesecake. I think it would have been a nice touch if they charged me $8 for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"After 2 visits and not being successful...the 3rd time's (visit) a charm...lol
I came on a Tuesday night after dinner at around 9:15pm. Essentially I was just trying my luck with a shorter line since I parked at a nearby parking lot. When I got to downtown earlier, the line was just too long so I did not even bother going near the store....but by this time, the line was acceptable. I told my friend who was visiting from Hong Kong about this new Japanese Cheesecake place that opened up and there is ALWAYS a line. He thought it was unbelievable but surely enough we were in that line for roughly an hour and we each got a 6\" cheesecake.
I know my friend wasn't planning to get anything but I persuaded him to since we did line up for this....to be honest, would I line up again? Probably not as when it gets to line ups like this, I don't have much patience.  If I came any earlier, it would definitely be more than an hour wait. I am so glad he enjoyed it too!

In terms of the cheese cake itself, it was indeed, fluffy and creamy. It is definitely good especially when you eat it while it is warm.  While lining up, I did enjoy seeing how the little Japanese bakery worked. You could essentially count down with the oven and see how fresh the cakes are. The staff are super friendly and I love how systematic this place is especially with their ticketing structure. We got the last batch of cheesecakes and they make it clear that you would only get a cheesecake if you had the ticket.
Lastly, the shop can get a little stuffy but good thing the night I went, it was not a super hot.

I probably will be back....but when there is an extremely short line haha.
Remember to bring cash and your patience :)"}
{"text":"I tried their cheese cake for the first time today and I know how famous they are for having line ups and our wait was about 20 minutes so it wasn't so bad (for someone who isnt in a hurry)

The cheese cake was sweet and very soft.. almost mushy.. even grandparents would LOVE to eat something soft like this. Taste wise was mediocre... its not something I would constantly go back for but its good to have occasionally for a treat for people or for yourself.

Overall, I recommend this place if you want to try something new...depending on your taste buds you may or may not like it. Its 10$ a cheesecake PER customer. So if you want to buy like four then make sure to bring some people with you since they wont give you four if its only you thats buying. It has to do with the \"being fair with the customers\" thing and I kind of understand that.

FYI, they only do cash and debit."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, their cheesecake is very yummy!! So as their mocha cakes!!! 10 dollar for this cake is a good price. I tried eating this cake as hot, warm and cold, it was great in all temperatures. Very light, can finish the whole thing if I don't stop myself!!! it is my family and friends favourite too. You can have their small muffins as well if you are looking for a quick snack."}
{"text":"I've heard so much hype over uncle tetsu's cheesecake, I finally managed to get some and to be honest I was left very disappointed. 

Although I did cheat and went to the cafe instead to get the green tea cheesecake and Magdelenes instead of waiting in the 2 hour line. The cheesecake was alright, it was moist and fluffy  but had very little green tea flavor and was very unsatisfying. For $10 for such a small cake, i was expecting it a lot but was left disappointed.

The green tea ice cream was also a let down. From the machine it looked like it would a green tea soft serve ice cream but it was closer to a sorbert texture, a mix of ice and matcha green tea in cream form. It was ok but not worth the $3 for a cone.

Why people would line up here for more than 20 mins is beyond me, I didn't thing this place was worth the time or effort to try."}
{"text":"Luckily I had time to go to the Front Street food festival where Uncle Tetsu had a stall. I went today around 1pm and there was no lineup AT ALL! Whattt?! I decided to get the 1/4 slice but I shouldve gotten a full cake because after I got my cheesecake, there was a huge lineup. 

Honestly, the hype for this cheesecake is over exaggerated. I would definitely not wait more than 10 minutes for this cheesecake. My rating is solely based on the cheesecake itself - super fluffy and cheesecakey! It's so fluffy that it's like I paid half for air. Well, now that I've tried it, I don't think I'll be eating it again unless they open more locations to reduce the wait time."}
{"text":"5 stars for their madeleines, 4 for their cake and well, 3 for their constant line-ups. I usually go for the madeleines just because it also means no line-ups. Yes, their cakes are delicious, but I'm not so sure that they justify the 20mins-1hr wait times, especially with the winter coming soon. It is also $10 per cheesecake, which are pretty small, so the price + wait time does take a hit on the overall value of the cake."}
{"text":"Not worth the hype! I've wanted to try this for months, but didn't want to line up. Finally, I saw a \"short\" line (about a 15 minute wait) and decided to check it out. It was good, but given the hype, I thought it would be spectacular. It's a light cheesecake; definitely a different twist, but is not worth waiting more than 15 minutes in line."}
{"text":"What is the line for? They make fresh batches at a time and one cake per person only? This must be good because as we wait in line it only seemed to grow longer behind us. While two of us waited in line, the other two walked to the nearest Starbucks waited in line there, got our iced coffee and returned... so is it worth the wait, exchanging stories with fellow line followers, breathing the amazing sweet buttery aroma that fills the air?
... ... ... ... miles later away from Toronto back into the quiet peaceful Ingersoll, we open the box and examine this Japanese cheesecake and realized the lightweight box the little logo of Uncle Tetsu stamped in the center... cut the cake in half, quarter, eighth... and serve.

If you love cheesecake, Uncle Tetsu's is a cheesecake that must have floated down from heaven into his bakery. 

So is this worth the wait? YES, yes standing in line amongst strangers is most definitely worth the wait.

And yes you will wish that each individual in your part purchases their own cheesecake."}
{"text":"Tastier than I thought it would be, better than the average tasteless spongy Japanese cheesecake, I still prefer American style cheesecake. The line can be ridiculous, really only worth going if the line is short."}
{"text":"Drove by Uncle Tetsu after lunch a few weeks ago and there was only a short line, so I decided to stop by and try out their New Matcha Cheesecake. Also bought their matcha icecream. I got the twist icecream (matcha and vanilla) last time and the vanilla milk flavour was a bit overpowering so I couldn't taste the matcha flavour much. Didn't really enjoy that one. This time I only ordered the matcha icecream and it was good. The matcha cheesecake was delicious too - light, fluffy and just full of matcha flavour. Definitely a happy customer. I still wouldn't line up an hour for this, but a 5-10 min lineup is ok with me."}
{"text":"Cheesecake is soft like a sponge cake not too sweet, fresh and hot magdalenes are nice too but my friend and I lined up for about 20 minutes at first and left after we decided to come back because we were very curious about the place that always have people, so we lined up for about 1hr again to get the cheesecake, I consider its very good but I don't think it's amazing enough for lining up that long. Also you can't order more than one for people.

They should find a bigger place and get more people baking them there's only one girl making all the cheesecake.  

The little shop has just three ovens; it produces 12 cakes every 10 to 15 mins but I think it's longer than that. $10 and an hour or two on the sidewalk?"}
{"text":"Went today 15 minutes before the 11 am opening and there was already a long lineup. I love cheesecake, so I want to try this Japanese cheesecake that everyone is talking about. I waited 1 hr & 10 minutes outside the store and another 1 hour and 5 mins inside the store for a total of 2 hrs & 15 mins. I don't mind waiting if the food is worth it,  but Uncle Tetsu Japanese cheesecake is just meh and won't blow your mind off. The madeleine is nothing special too, tasted like a regular cupcake minus the icing. I also think paying $17.56 for a cheesecake & 4 madeleines is such a steep price to pay.  So is it worth to stand in line for more than 2 hours, definitely not!  But if you don't have anything better to do and want to try a different type of cheesecake then go for it. Otherwise spend your money & time somewhere else."}
{"text":"Like several other Yelpers, curiosity got the best of us when we saw a line half-block long outside waiting to get in...reminiscent of Voodoo Donuts in Portland...mostly college age young adults. The thing with Uncle Tetsu's is the cakes are literally right out of the oven, and you can only buy one for each person in line. Our wait was about half hour. When the batch they've baked is done, they sell those to the first dozen in line, then they bake more while you wait. Crazy concept that obviously works. (The girl in front of us asked whether we were buying 3 cakes, delighted when we said no, and asked our son to buy one for her since she needed 2.)  The cake is not your western cheesecake, but more like a sponge cake texture. Not sweet. One cake's good for 3-4 people. Pretty tasty. Glad for the experience...and the cake."}
{"text":"Cutting to the chase for this place, is it worth it? Questionable. The line ups are a bit crazy for a $10 cheesecake, but this is only hampered by the volume that this bakery can pump out cheesecakes - which is only 12 every 25 minutes.  The cheesecakes are absolutely a delight to eat, fluffy, light, cheery and all around wonderfully prepared.  You can taste the savoury cheese,  surrounded by cake that is just right in airy fluffiness.  Much care has gone into preparing the batter.  You can be absolutely 100% be sure of the freshness as you see it leave the single oven at Uncle Tetsu's.

While waiting in line here a few months ago, a very, very disgruntled and grumpy pedestrian made it known that he was very unhappy that the legion of people lining up outside was somehow clogging the sidewalk.  He came shouting into the store, his face red with rage that it's somehow the bakery's fault for all their customers waiting in line. He could have easily walked around the line up like the other people that ignored the lines.  Whoevever said Canadians were all nice and smiley never met this guy. Maybe he was American, or was from Montreal... ;)  I kid, I kid!

Be warn, for now while the hype is high, bring plenty of patience, some water, a chatter or two to keep yourself and your friend occupied.  If you can make it past the waiting, you're in for a treat!"}
{"text":"Real good cheesecake. Light and delicate. Not too sweet but very smooth. Melts right away in your mouth. Yes I let mine sit in the fridge for about 4 hours. 

The next time I pick up one I'm planning on spiking it a little though. My plan is to slice the cake horizontally through the middle, spread either strawberry or blueberry jam and close the cake back on. The end result would be more like a layered cake with the berry jam sandwiched in between."}
{"text":"This place has really good japanese cheesecake and madeleines. There's a reason why there's so much hype, because it's delicious. Anyone who says they don't like it is basically an uncultured swine that doesn't have the taste for asian deserts. Sorry not sorry.

The green tea madeleines with red bean filling from their green tea cafe next door was also really good. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Update: went back to uncle Tetsu, this time during the weekday and there was much less of a line. Finally got to try the original cheesecake and oh my god. It is amazing. Totally worth waiting in line!!! It literally just melts in your mouth!! Creamy and fluffy and not too heavy. I highly recommend it!! 
The review below for the matcha one still holds :) 

We arrived at Uncle Tetsu and found an enormous line (as per usual) in front of the store... However, to my surprise there was one with a lesser line next to it, the difference? This one is uncle Tetsu matcha! Instead of the original cheesecake it is Japanese cheesecake with an extra Japanese twist, adding matcha +/- red bean to the cheesecake. Personally I love matcha, so it was an easy decision to make. And I am extremely happy with this decision. We bought one matcha ice cream and one matcha cheesecake ($10 for the cheesecake), and they were both awesome! The cheesecake was moist, just the right texture, and even after a day it was still great tasting, without losing a bit of the freshness. The matcha flavor wasn't overpowering either, which sometimes can be a concern. So that was also good. 
All in all, a solid cheesecake. I would definitely recommend it, but if you don't want to wait in line, lol, then don't go"}
{"text":"Like a cross between a cheesecake and a cloud - VERY GOOD! I liked it even better the next day :) 

I hated the 2 hour wait, but would get again IF no wait. 

Try it!"}
{"text":"The place is very tiny and not meant to sit in and enjoy the cake, that was the only downfall but as for the actual cheesecake it was amazing! It was so light and fluffy! Absolutely worth the wait."}
{"text":"I was lucky that I didn't have to line up for an hour, but I simply walked in and was lucky enough to order a cheese cake on the spot.

Uncle Tetsu cheesecake has more cheese flavour in comparison to Japanese cheesecake that you would find at T&T or most Chinese bakeries. It's very smooth and creamy in texture."}
{"text":"Well with all the hype...I decided to try uncle tetsu.  Final verdict...it's good...it's it worth the line up?  Not really.  I am a pastry chef by trade so I'm always exited about new pastry places opening up in toronto.  The cheesecake was really fluffy and moist,  freshly baked.  I get it it's all about quality and freshness but because of it and how small the place is its hard to serve a lot of people. I tried a couple of times to line up but I didn't have enough patience to wait 2 hours.  Try lining up early in the morning...it's easier.  Also during the summer they had a tent over at union station and that was where I usually get mine... no long line up might not be that crazy fresh but it's still awesome...taste the same. So yes it's good but it's not worth lining up for more than 30 mins."}
{"text":"A great cheesecake with good flavour. Not too much cream cheese flavour, which is a good thing. Definitely very fresh, warm and fluffy.

 A bit of a long line up on a weekday to get but worth the wait."}
{"text":"It's an experience. Lining up for a small cheesecake. Did it twice, will not do it again. Lol

The cake was good, but tasted quite \"eggy\" - sort of like sweet scrambled eggs, especially when warm right out of the oven. I suggest you take it home, and eat the next day out of the fridge. Tasted much better then. 

I think it's definitely worth trying once."}
{"text":"Line for the regular cheesecake was too long so I decided to try the Matcha cafe.
Ended up trying their Matcha \"soft serve\" which tasted more like a frozen yogurt than anything. Also tried the Matcha latte and their madeleine which were both okay. But that soft serve got me really disappointed.

Verdict: The matcha cafe was nothing special, hence there wasn't really a line for it. If you want something that's good and want to wait in line for it, then their regular cheese cake is pretty good.

That's all."}
{"text":"Pretty decent cheesecake, but to me nothing special (my bf didn't like it at all). Madeleines tasted very average, Im pretty sure you can find better tasting muffins elsewhere. Such a shame because I waited for 1,5h for that.
I am not doing this again, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"This review will sound more like a PSA than a review, but the worst thing about this place is not really the line, it's the other customers. Some of these people lack common sense, or are just outright selfish. I once had a guy who just cut me in line and completely ignored me when I told him that I was in line. Thankfully the worker saw this and told him that I should be served first. Anyway, here are some things to keep in mind when you're standing in line:

First, KEEP THE DOOR CLOSED. I don't care how cold it is outside, we all had to wait out there at some point. By you opening the door to feel a bit of the heat, you end up bringing in a gust of chilly wind into the entire bakery making everyone inside cold in the process. Don't be selfish, wait patiently like everyone else, and stand outside with the door closed. The store definitely should have a \"KEEP THE DOOR CLOSED\" sign at the front.

Second, MOVE IN. The entire bakery can fit about 10 people, so move all the way to the back and make a loop to the cash register so that more people can wait inside. Be mindful of all the people waiting outside in the cold, try to comfortably fit as many people as you can. You don't need that much space around you.

Third, KNOW YOUR ORDER before you get to the register. Honestly, it's not that hard - they only have three things on the menu. Their cheesecake is what they're famous for and what everyone is in line for, so yes, you probably should just get it. No, you cannot get items from the Matcha store in the original Uncle Tetsu, it's right next door and there's never a line there so walk over after. Google what each item is, read the description, don't ask what the ingredients are for god sakes, there are so many people behind you waiting. Just use Google, they are a fairly popular chain worldwide, you will probably find any information about them there. Or just ask another person in line, you're going to be standing with them for a while anyway, so why not befriend a stranger in the process.

Ok so now I got that out of the way, here's my actual review:

I avoided this place for a while because of the ridiculous lines, but coincidentally I had a trip booked to Japan over the summer and went to the Uncle Testu in Fukuoka to see what the fuss was about. No one there seem to know what I was talking about and once I found it in an underground train station, there was no line. In fact, there wasn't even one customer aside from me. I was still excited regardless, and after taking a bite, I think I would have to agree with the other reviewers that, \"it's not worth the wait\".

That's probably the most common response you'll hear from people. But the question is not really about whether it's worth the wait (because what kind of Japanese cheesecake is worth a one-hour wait), what if there wasn't a wait? Then would you still go get one? Then I would say yes. Japanese cheesecake is more like a sweet cheese soufflé than a New York style cheesecake that most people are used to - They're actually quite different. If you don't like the cheesecake from Uncle Tetsu, it just means you don't like Japanese cheesecake, because they're all going to more-or-less taste the same. If you do like Japanese cheesecake, then this place won't disappoint.

The line can be frustrating, but I actually think it's part of the experience. The whole absurdity of a collective group of people wasting their time lining up for a $10 cheesecake is quite a rare event. The hype likely isn't going to last forever (looking at how they're currently doing in Japan), so I don't see the problem in joining in on the hysteria to come out of it and say, \"this is it?\", to go home and write some snarky review on Yelp telling people it's not worth the wait. That whole process is the Uncle Tetsu of Toronto experience - even if it's not worth the wait, you STILL did it even after reading all the reviews telling you not to. Maybe we all want a piece of the experience more so than the cake itself.

You might think it's a good idea for them to expand to meet the demands, but the demands only exist because the supplies are low. If they expand too quickly, they'll follow the same fate as Krispy Kreme did about 10 years ago with their aggressive expansion in the GTA. That line you see is what creates the hype, so they'd want to create a line for as long as they can.

Now, it's actually possible to come at a time when there isn't a line. I live fairly close by and I've come at multiple times when I was actually the only person in the store! I've noticed that the line becomes long during the school-year, where students from Ryerson and U of T tend to conglomerate here when they have time to kill. The line was surprisingly dead during the winter holidays. But then, the cake just doesn't taste as good when you don't work for it. So just think of it this way; the longer you wait in line, the more delicious (or more disappointing) that cake is going to taste."}
{"text":"Went back again and tried the angel hat this time. I had wished that they advertised this more because it's way better than the original cheesecake, but then I realize that it's better to keep it a secret so that they don't run out of these too fast. As they say on their website, the angel hat is definitely lighter and fluffier, and it's so easy to keep eating until the whole thing is gone because it's just not dense at all. It's also smaller (though same price), so it's totally possible for two people to finish it in one go. I don't know when or how often they have this available, so I consider ourselves lucky that they had it when we went in."}
{"text":"I'm between A-OK and Yay! I'm a fan.
If you only enjoy rich, decadent, cheese cake... which i love... then this may not be for you.... 
Uncle Tetsu provides an almost miraculous balance between Angel Food Cake and the popular cheese cake.  Upon your first cut into the beautifully presented cake, you first notice how delicately soft it is.  You almost feel bad carving it up with a dull knife.
The cake is very light and you almost feel like finishing up the entire portion at first bite.
I waited about 1.5 hours after class one evening.
If you have things to do, family to see, don't make the line.. if you have time to kill and are in the area anyways, try it out.
The cakes are made on the spot as they are served, and take about 40 minutes each batch of twelve.  The area is completely open and you can even count down the minutes on the oven timer where your cake is being held.
I'm a fan of the cake... not so much a fan of the wait... but quality requires time and patience... so enjoy... 
As for the prices... they aren't too bad... cheese cake tends to be expensive in general.. the cost here was $10 for a 6\" cake, taxes included."}
{"text":"i feel really lucky that i got to try this in the first few days it opened, i waited in line for about 30-45 mins

the owner came out at around 15 mins with samples explaining how this is the first Japanese cheesecake place open outside of asia and why we were waiting so long 

i got mandolins (sp?) and a cheesecake (limit 1 cheesecake per person) and i was really pleased! 
the cheesecake was soft (not thick like traditional American cheesecake) and not too sweet
its easy to eat a whole one by yourself, personally i think it was worth the wait and was pleased to sample early in the wait to know I'd be happy with my purchase"}
{"text":"Big fan of the cheesecake. Granted, I didn't have to wait in line like everyone else, even though I showed up on a Saturday at noon. It was nearly empty. 

I'm not even a bakery fan all like that but I really enjoyed their cheesecake. Moist, fluffy, mildly sweet. I've had Love Me Sweet's cheesecake, and it's pretty good in its own right, but the texture of Tetsu's cake won me over. It's just slightly more moist and eggy, and LMS is slightly more dense and more 'sponge cakey'. 

Sucks that they limit it to one per person, but maybe I can twist their arm a bit next time because I intend to take a bunch with me back over the border."}
{"text":"I've never been to the actual store but I LOVE their cheesecakes! My friend brought me one to take home to Vancouver when we didn't have time to go there. When she offered another time to being one home for me, I couldn't resist. 

The cake is fluffy and airy but cheesy. You have the option to eat it cold or warm. I prefer it cold where it's a bit more dense and cheesier in flavour. If you warm it up 10s in the microwave, the cake becomes so light and fluffy like an eggy angel cake. Delicious"}
{"text":"Went here a few days ago and the lines are gone now. It was in and out in 5 minutes. They have increased production and wait times are awesome now. Clearly the hype has died down. As I mentioned before the cheesecake I got this time was again dense and thick. I am thinking they are cutting down on their ingredients or using less eggs. It lost the airy and smooth texture it once had. The recipe has definitely changed compared to when they first opened. It tastes just like a sponge cake with a hint of cheese. Still hate the fact they still take cash only which is shady, at least have debit. It's been a good 3 days and I still have half a cake in my fridge. They have followed the typical business where they become so popular that they change the recipe or cut down on expensive ingredients, thinking the consumer will not notice."}
{"text":"Make sure you get the Madeleine cakes! So soft and delicious."}
{"text":"Best cheesecake I have ever had! The imitations are good, but not as good as Uncle Tetsu's. I visited Sunday morning right after they opened, and didn't encounter a line at all. They only sell the original cheesecake and madeleines at this location (when I visited). This is definitely a must-visit shop!"}
{"text":"Let's start off with the line up that no one can miss outside their little store and which 99% of you will be waiting in as well. Unless you go early when they open which is 7am, then that's the only time you don't have to wait in line, but any other time, good luck on how long you have to wait!

The store is extremely small which fits literally only 2 columns of people, so the line going in and turning back out. It SUPERR hot and stuffy inside while your waiting in line it makes you wanna give up, but you see yourself almost there. Their kitchen is open so you can see them make the cheesecake mixture, pour it into the mold then place it into the ovens. There's also another baker by the window facing the street making fresh batches of smaller cupcakes.

Once you walk near the store or even walk pass by, you can smell the cheesecake. It's the eggs that your actually smelling that gives off such an aroma. 

You can pretty much calculate how long you have to wait in line. Each batch of cheesecake takes 45mins from scratch to make. But good thing you don't have to wait 45mins for each batch. They have 3 ovens baking constantly, so each time the batch gets sold, the next batch will be ready in 16-20mins. They time this very well, so each batch wait fairly the same amount of time. Thank god that they limit to one cheesecake per person so basically if you count every 12 people infront of you is 20mins wait.

The fresh cheesecake is really soft and light. It feels like it melts into your mouth with a strong aroma of eggs. I have to admit it is one of the best Japanese cheesecake I have ever had. 

Although it is good, but not as good that I would line up again."}
{"text":"Wow! One of my Friends gifted me a cheesecake from Uncle Tetsu's place. WOW! It was totally fluffy! Creamy! Lite! Deliciously awesome good! I had to find out where he got it from & where was this place. Now I know it's right up the street from where I work. So I'll definitely be bu there to pick up a cheesecake soon. I'm going to recommend this place to everyone for sure!"}
{"text":"The lines are gone it seems and after several months of abstinence, I was finally able to get my fix. I can totally understand the novelty of this stuff and it's appeal but I think it's fair to give them about 3 stars.

While this stuff is pretty rare over here in the Great White North, it's almost a dime a dozen out East. During my trip to Japan, I had the opportunity to eat this stuff till my heart's content but I really could not find it in me to rate it over the top. I am a traditionalist you see and my heart has been set on that NY cheesecake. That dense and super cheesy stuff is far superior in my mind and my mouth. However, to most Asians that do not have an appreciation for cheese (I know you're out there!) this stuff is great! You can say you love cheese but without really eating it.

Anyhow with all the rambling aside. This stuff is great for enjoying with your cup of green tea. Try it once and be done with the hype."}
{"text":"It's a giant egg tart with no crust!

We got the classic cheesecake and shared it between 4 people. I liked it! But the 3 other people i was with weren't too keen on it.

Cheesecake is reasonably priced ($10). It's good desert (not too sweet) but the line up is a hassle.

We also got some madeleines. They were good but nothing amazing."}
{"text":"Cheap compared to American cheesecake. The only downside is the really long lines. Cake tastes best cold after placed in a fridge for 2 hours+, it's more solid and dense. The madeleines are too sweet in my opinion, but if you typically like sweet pastries you'll enjoy them. The packaging is very cute."}
{"text":"What we had: Regular cheesecake, green tea cheesecake with red bean

Taste: 8/10 
Yummy, light, and cheesy. It's like eating sweet cheesy clouds. Better eaten fresh/hot than cold. The green tea one is more moist/runny but still good.

Value: 8/10 
An entire cheesecake is $10, though they are quite light and small so you can totally demolish one in a few minutes.

Service/Convenience: 2/10 
Sometimes you have to wait in a huge line and IMO it's not worth the line up. It's just cheesecake, people. When there's no line it's definitely worth checking out!

Would go back? Occasionally, when there is no line.

Would recommend to friend? Yes, the cheesecakes.

{"text":"Came on a warm Friday afternoon and there was a line of about 15 people at the Original Store and about 5 at the Matcha. Line moved quite fast and it was only a 20 minute wait. The aroma inside and outside the store was just mouthwatering! Got a original cheesecake $10 and went next door to the Matcha and got 4 (Buy 3, get 1 free) of the matcha Madeleine's (2 red bean, 2 original). The cheesecake was better than I expected, especially after reading some reviews which disappointed a lot of people. It was fluffy and the cheese flavor was still very rich. The Madeleine's were okay, I would've preferred a stronger matcha taste. It is so worth the lineup if there is less than 20 people not for 2hrs. I definitely recommend putting it in the fridge for about an hour or so before consuming, tastes so much better!"}
{"text":"They open at 8 am in Union station. Not much of a line forms before then. A good place to get your cheesecake on the way. As noted, one cake per person. The signage is quite plain for everyone to see. They don't really seem to want much \"chit chat\" either. Rambling on about how you dated a Japanese girl once won't win you any brownie points."}
{"text":"If I could give it a 0 I would. I got the matcha cheesecake and my bf got the soft ice cream. The matcha cheesecake was soft and mushy and I could barely taste any matcha nor cheese. The red bean helped the flavouring tho, without it I wouldn't be able to eat it. As for the soft ice cream, it was watered down and almost flavourless. A big disappointed. The cream overpowered the matcha flavour. Meh. I will never eat them again even even if it's free."}
{"text":"Too much hype. Save your time and money.

Luckily, I didn't have to wait in a ridiculous line-up for this. We were walking by the area, just before the shop was closing and decided to stop in to try it. These Japanese cheesecakes are $10 each, only one per customer. Made super fresh! We watched them stamp our cheesecakes with the iconic Uncle Tetsu logo, seconds prior to our possession.

These are different from New York style cheesecakes... I did not expect this and was not ready...
The original cheesecake was not sweet at all, it tasted like creamy egg custard.
The Matcha green tea cheesecake was good, but had a slightly bitter aftertaste.

The texture was soft, fluffy and light. I liked how each bite melted in your mouth. However, this is not cheesecake to me. It was alright, but just not worth it. I've had better cheesecakes."}
{"text":"The lineup is worth it. This cake is amazing, it's soft and fluffy.
It's basically a cross between a vanilla cake and a cheesecake.

I like it cold and warm. Good in the fridge for 3 days, room temp 12 hours. I will try the matcha one next time!!

These things are so good, only 1 cake per person!

I just tried the Matcha Green Tea Cheesecake. Stick with original, it's much better.
Match Cheesecake was good, but it wasn't as good as the original.

Texture is the same as the original, however the taste of the match was very strong, to the point where it basically overpower the taste of the cheesecake. Its like the taste of a green tea frappucino with the texture of a japanese cheesecake fluffy."}
{"text":"came here on a weekday about there weeks ago - since the cheesecake place is. Always busy I decided to try Ry the cafe instead and their shaved ice with green tea overrun was pretty good"}
{"text":"I know if I waited a few more weeks, the hype around here won't be as bad and the line up won't be as long.  This has Krispy Kreme in Canada all over again.  Remember lining up for hours?  I did...I waited for a few hours in the drive through to buy some donuts after the store had closed.

Anyhow, Uncle Tetsu...Let's get down to business...

If you plan on going in the evening, you better read this before you head out, lest you be disappointed.

Granted, today was a holiday so there were more people in line than a regular week night.  Last week I went there on a Thursday evening at 9pm and people said they waited 45 mins.  Not bad.

Today, got there at 7.  At around 8:15 the worker came out to tell us that because they had limited number of cheesecakes left, each person was limited to buying one (during the day it's 2 cakes).  They gave a playing card (this was your golden ticket) that you had to give them when paying.  If you didn't have a card?  No cake

When we left at 9:30, some poor souls were waiting at the end asked us how long we had to wait.  I told them if they didn't have a card, they needn't bother lining up anymore (too bad the last people to get cards didn't tell the people behind them there weren't anymore cakes left).  The last cakes go in at 10:15, that's why they had to reduce the number.

As for the taste?  It tastes like the T&T Japanese cheesecake, except you get it freshly made.  As for the madelenes cupcakes?  You can taste alot of butter.

They have a cake called \"angel hat\" but that won't be out till the summer.

The cake is $8.88 yet they charge tax to make it $10.  Uh...there's no tax on cake!"}
{"text":"Best cheesecake ever! It's so fresh and light! They make the cheesecake on the spot and because of that, the service is slow but it's every bit worth it. Although I must mention that it tastes more like pudding than a regular cheesecake but definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I had wondered what all the fuss was about until I tried it.  Divine.  Light and melts in your mouth.  Worth waiting for in the 20 minute line while being frozen silly in the snow.  Thank you, Uncle Tetsu, because now I can proudly boast of having eaten an entire cheesecake all by myself.  Get it HOT."}
{"text":"I don't like cheesecake. When I lived in southern California lots of my friends would want to go to Cheesecake Factory and I would never go unless it was someone's birthday or something. I think of cheesecake as a gross, heavy, lazy dessert - yucky texture, syrupy toppings, fake whip cream. Chemical and saccharine. I think of it as down market and cheap tasting, the last thing that a macaron and good chocolate girl like me would enjoy. 

So needless to say I was in no rush to try Uncle Tetsu. But I walked by one day and there was no line, my man had just gotten some good news and I thought I would bring home a cake as a treat. This cheesecake has nothing in common with the Cheesecake Factory. It is light, airy, a beautiful texture like eating a cloud. It has a very mild sweetness that just compliments the cloud-like texture perfectly. It's absolutely delicious, like nothing else I've ever eaten. I really enjoy the simplicity of it, and I can see combining it with some fresh fruit, homemade peach syrup, or brandied cherries at home. The possibilities are really endless. It is lovely. It is nothing like I ever thought cheesecake could be.

Read any of my reviews and your notice that I'm wild about texture. This cheesecake has a dreamy texture both warm - more of an egg, souffle-y texture -  and cold. Once it's been refrigerated, it becomes a little denser, a little more spongy, but it's still light, airy, and beautiful to eat. Even after being in the fridge for 3 days, there was no change in texture. Divine.

To all of the reviewers here that listed lineups as their main reason for a negative review, that's just lame. If people want to stand in line, they are free to do so. To judge something by \"how long you have to wait for it\" or \"how stupid people are to wait\" is neither reasonable nor fair. I walked right in and bought a cake. I would do it again. Whether I would wait in line has no place in this review. The point is, that cheesecake is wonderful, and I give it 5 stars. 5 stars from a girl that doesn't even like cheesecake. Why don't you try it for yourself?"}
{"text":"Finally got to try the infamous Japanese cheesecake. Surprised there's still a line up after being opened for almost a year! The matcha cafe next door had no line. Wonders if this means the matcha cheesecake isn't as popular. Saw some people ordering the green tea Madeleines. Will try next time when I'm in the area.

Verdict after 30 minutes of waiting At 8pm on sat:

Day of: very fluffy and light. melts in the mouth. However, I didn't really taste the cheesecake flavour as much as the strong egg flavour. It was too eggy for my liking. B

Day old: chilled it in the fridge for one day. I have to say I like it better when its chilled. It's not as fluffy, but still soft and the cheesecake flavour really comes out. It's more cheesecake flavour than eggy flavour. I definitely like day old more! 
B+

Two day old cake: still soft, not as fluffy, taste like egg more than cream cheese. B- 

I definitely like day old the best!

I can see why people hype this place up. The cheesecake is made to order and is very fresh. However, like others, I don't necessarily think it's worth the wait, but it's worth a taste!

$10 no tax and debit is accepted now. You can bypass line and go in if you are only getting the honest Madeleines. I didn't get those. Perhaps, next time. I liked that I could watch them make the desserts. Pretty entertaining. The signs on the wall are hilarious both in and out of store. Take a look the next time you are waiting! One tip, if you go around 9pm, make sure you get a card that guarantees that you will get a cake. One time I went, waited for 20 mins to realize that they closed the line because only people with cards got guaranteed a cake. You can wait but you may not get cake."}
{"text":"I've had Uncle Testu's cheesecake several times and have been lucky enough never having to stand in line for it!  
I can only guess why the average rating is only 3 stars.  Perhaps it was all the hype, only to end up with this spongy, light, not too sweet \"cheesecake\".  Anyone looking for a traditional cheesecake (think Cheesecake Factory) will be sorely disappointed.  
When I had my first bite, I must admit my first thought was \"what's the big deal?\" but as I kept eating, I enjoyed it more and more.  I can easily eat half the cake in a single sitting.
For those who don't like their cakes dense and covered with thick icing."}
{"text":"YUM! We saw everyone carrying around these bags, and had to try! We ordered plain, matcha, and matcha with azuki beans = all were very tasty! I was impressed how these small and sponge-y cheesecakes could be so rich yet so light and airy!"}
{"text":"If you're a Filipino and know what a mamon is, the texture of their Japanese cheesecake reminds me of a really good mamon. 

If you've not a Filipino and you have no idea what I'm talking about, it's like a sponge cake, that's airy, not fluffy, and has a smooth texture of cream cheese. I'd say it's like a hybrid between a Cheesecake and a sponge cake. I don't know if that makes any sense actually lol. It's good to try, just to try, but not something I'd line up for for two hours. 

There's actually a twitter feed on their line up, /tetsulineup. Check it out if you're bored and maybe you can pick up a pattern as to what hours are their busiest. 

You can only purchase one cake for yourself, so if your friends want a whole cake, they have to go through the line up adventure with you. 

I went to the shop beside it and got this matcha red bean madeleines. It's like a yummy green tea cupcake. 

The cost is $2.65 each, but if you get three, you get the forth one for free. My friend and I got 4, paid $9 in total and split it between the two of us. 

The cheesecake is good, but I really don't know what that line up hype is all about. Maybe it's just something people get to remind them of a place they once have visited or lived in? 

If you're with friends and want to kill some time, drop by and try it."}
{"text":"Usually, if you walk by Uncle Tetsu's Japanese Cheesecake you will see a huge line outside, luckily if you do what I did and go there around 9:00AM that line is nonexistent!. Uncle Tetsu's brings the delicious Japanese Cheesecake right here to Toronto and it's a game changer. You get a neat little box that holds it and when you open up this little box you are greeted with a round little cheesecake with a little picture on it. I don't have much to say about this place, but it's a must try for anyone in the city."}
{"text":"Wanted to check this out because I love matcha. The lineup was short and you don't really have to wait too long to get in. Had a matcha madeline with red bean. It tasted like a muffin. Was a bit disappointed because the cheesecakes are so rich & tasty. Madelines are $2.50 each with tax. I'm going to come back in August when teh green tea cheesecake is ready. The green boxes that the madelines come in are super cute."}
{"text":"Love their Original Cheesecake! It's worth the 10-15 min wait for sure. The Angel Cakes are fantastic as well, especially when they pull them right out of the oven, piping hot. Each person can only order 1 cheesecake at a time, if you want 2, go with another person!"}
{"text":"This review is long over due. Remember when Uncle Tetsus opened last year and you would find a HUGE line worth an hour wait? I was curious as to why this cheesecake was very hyped and talked about. My friend actually bought me a piece to try which i unfortunately did not like and was puzzled why it received so much talk...

However as i was making my treck back home at Union Station the other day i noticed that they opened up a small store inside the station so i figured i could give the cheesecake another chance and try it again. There was only one size which was a 6 inch cake and cost me 10 dollars and needless to say it didnt live up to my taste buds yet again... i tried it both heated in a microwave for a few seconds as recommended and cold. Both were bland and tasted like milk powder , the only thing i liked was probably the texture. It had a fluffy moussy texture to it. Aesthetics of the cake is another reason i give Uncle Tetsus two stars.

To be honest , i expected so much more from this place from how popular it seemed but i guess not everything that is hyped up tastes good."}
{"text":"This place. I seen huge line ups at this place. The line up made me crave for it so bad before trying it. So one day I saw the line was short so I jumped in and wanted like 10 to 15 min. I was expecting the best cheese cake I had in my whole life. It was not. I donot get y is it so busy. The cheese cake tasted soft with no flavor. They add nothing to the cheese cake so it is plane. And very soft. One thing I have to say is it is unique the place is very unique and special you feel like ur in Japan or something. Hot girls go there alot so maybe it is a pick up spot which makes it busy. So people come in not for the cheese cake. I would not recommend this place only if the line is empty and quick other wise I would not say it is worth the wait as usually the wait is much longer."}
{"text":"I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. 

Good cheese cake that is super light, almost soufflé esque. 

The madalines are pretty average.

Overall not worth waiting in line for over an hour but I would wait 10 minutes."}
{"text":"it lived up to the hype.  lines stink but we went early"}
{"text":"Delicious cheese cake. Had to wait a couple of minutes to get as the place is always packed. Would highly recommend though. Great tasting cakes all around"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype about uncle tetsu. Their cheesecake tastes the same as any other asian bakery. Why not just go to your local T&T and pick up the same cake for 1/2 of the price and 1/10 the wait time? I feel like most people buy these cakes for instagram/snapchat rather than for personal consumption."}
{"text":"I didn't line up or even go near this place, but I did get to try some of it, and I have to say it was ok. I would neither go out of my way or stand in line for a piece of cake. Especially one that is not going to blow my mind.

By Cheesecake standards, it tasted too cakey for my standards of a cheesecake. Very plain as well. Nothing really to write home about. When I think of cheesecake I want it to be very tall with a graham cracker base, no cracks, strong enough to support some type of fruit topping like a tart or even some added whip cream, but Tetsu didn't have any of that.

It is short, flat, round cheesecake. Mine had a few cracks. it was denser than I would like my cheesecake to be. I would like it to be a lot lighter and fluffier. Maybe they would want to liven up the party with a hint of matcha, lemon, or lime.

I don't know who these people are standing in line, but unlike other things in Toronto, people standing in line attracts other people to stand in line. It must be an instinctual thing or something..."}
{"text":"Delicious cheesecake and madelaines, but overhyped and not really worth the 1+ hour wait. Definitely easier to just get the green-tea-flavoured variants from the matcha cafe next door."}
{"text":"Soft & fluffy.  The cheese and butter did not make this cake too overly heavy.  It was very heavenly.  I came couple of times so far.  There is the honey original flavour cheesecake shop on the right & green tea flavoured cheesecake on the left.  Both are very good.  But the original flavour one would taste slightly better.  U will be able to tell when you see the line ups outside.  I always go during office hours to avoid the long line ups.  Personally I will not wait in line for 2 hours for anything.  To each their own.  But some people would think it's worth it.  The line ups died down now.  So it's the perfect time to try it out now if u havent already.  I bought it for my grandparents and they actually loved this cake even though they are not entirely into sweets.  They liked it more than cakes 4 times the price.  Value here is superb!  Awesome love this place."}
{"text":"Atmosphere 
We waited at night for around half an hour for a Cheesecake. 

Food
I've never had Japanese cheesecake before so I can't really compare to other places. But compared to your normal cheesecake, it is significantly lighter. The consistency reminds me of a sponge cake, and it tastes like a cheesecake. i thoroughly enjoyed it, and I feel like it would be great to bring to parties/events. For my friend and I, we couldn't finish the cake, and we wished they sold it in slices instead. But regardless 10$ for a cake is hella cheap. 

Service
You're only limited to one cheesecake, but you can get an unlimited number of madelines."}
{"text":"I'm somewhere between a 3 star and 4 star, so I'll round up.

Having tried the cheesecake and madelines twice now, I can confirm that I am indeed a fan. What I'm not a fan of however, is the whole standing in line part....obviously. First time I waited an hour and fifteen minutes and the second time about 50 minutes. What frustrates me the most is the time between cheesecake batches. Roughly a 15 minute wait where the line-up doesn't move AT ALL. They need to get the timing down a little better. Super inefficient.

Careful not to be deceived by the line looking short from the outside. It loops around when you get inside the store. Last time I was there, there were only about 6-7 people outside and I was all like \"oh yay, it's not that long at all\" but the wait was still 50 minutes. I also noticed people on both occasions calling their friends to come stand in line once they reached closer to the front. Not cool!

I also love those adorable paper bags you get with your order. OMG SO CUTE!!!!!!!!!  

I would say I'll be back once the hype dies down and the line-ups dissipate, but it's been like four months now and they're still going strong. If you really want to try it, I'd say what the hell...go for it...it's worth waiting in line once just to say you've done it. 

And just for the record: it tastes way better CHILLED! :)"}
{"text":"It tastes great not amazing like we were told. Tastes like bread pudding 
Not worth the line
But the muffins r not like American muffins aka not full of crap and tastes so good"}
{"text":"Oh uncle tetsu...u have stolen the hearts of many...and disappointed the hearts of many more. The hype train was strong with this one with lines spanning 45 mins to an Hour. But now you can only wait 15 mins for their cheesecake...and even that is still too long 

Small and cramped. As you wait for the line you feel like your face is gonna melt. Judging by some of the girls in line they already did. 

The cakes themselves are alright. It's more of a if I didn't have to wait in line maybe I'd buy it once in a while. Basically tasted like a blended egg tart with hints of cheese. The texture itself is enjoyable. Super light and fluffy bordering jelly like. However overall there was a distinct lack off cheese taste. For a cheesecake that's what I need. If I'm gonna be shitting brick because of the dairy I better be able to taste it.

Overall it's a meh. If u pass by and don't see a line I wouldn't say don't go in. It's just not worth the effort to make time for."}
{"text":"The cheese cake is good, but not worth waiting in line for more than half an hour though. I'd rather go some where else, if the line is too long."}
{"text":"Such fluffiness... I like how Japanese cheesecakes are much lighter and less sweet than the typical American cheesecake, and Uncle Tetsu's ~CA$10 Original 6 inch Japanese Cheesecake is on point with all of that. I hear that the wait times and lines for these cheesecakes can get pretty long, and I personally don't believe they're worth waiting more than 15 minutes for, but these yummy clouds of delightfulness are definitely worth the money and a wonderful way to brighten up your day! Mmm."}
{"text":"There's a line outside right now as I post this. Toronto - the city that always lines up for things without knowing what it is.

Let me put it out there. Reading the bad reviews of this place makes me laugh because of how completely illogical the reasoning is. There really 2 reasons that this place gets bad reviews:

1) It doesn't taste like Westernized cheese cake
2) The line is too long

Let's tackle #2 first. This store (I presume) has no control over the demand for it's product. If Torontonians want to line up for 1-2 hours for a $10 cheesecake, that is that person's choice. To knock down a store or restaurant because a person took a risk to wait a long time for something they may or may not like is not the restaurant's fault.

Now the #1. This cheesecake is as all reviews say. It's light. Fluffy. Dense in a way. Not in your face flavor. Now that's a positive or negative depending on whether you like it or not. But the fact is, this is what Japanese cheesecake in essence is supposed to taste like. It's like going to a steakhouse and saying the steak sucks because you don't enjoy steak. 

So yes - this place is good. It is Japanese cheesecake. It is not westernized cheesecake. Is it worth a 2 hour wait? That is up to you and not the restaurant's fault."}
{"text":"Not worth the wait or the money. I put off trying the cheesecake until now, but since my friend and I had some time to spare today to wait for 30 minutes we said heck, might as well join in on the hype.

The line was short today, perhaps it was because of the weather? Anyways, we both got our cheesecake and tried it at home.

The verdict? It was mediocre - nothing special. I'm glad I tried it though, now I know that I'm not a huge fan of fluffy and light cheesecakes. You couldn't really taste the cream cheese so it might be perfect for people who like the egg/milk flavours.

One thing that really turned me off was how wasteful they are in terms of throwing away cakes that do not pass their quality check. It hurt to watch them throw away 12 cakes in the garbage!! The cakes didn't look the best (they had cracks on the surface, but I'm sure they tasted fine). Hopefully they find a way to minimize the wastage!

Remember it is cash only. $10 for the cake and one per customer. They open at 7AM."}
{"text":"I heard from my friends that uncle Tetsu sell the best japanese cheesecake . I always want to try it and I am surprise that they have one next to pacific mall . The cheesecake smells really good and the line was long . We brought one and ate it right away . It was soft , light and yummy ."}
{"text":"Saw the lines the first nite we were in the area and decided on the last nite we had to check out what this was all about. Didn't even know what we were standing in line for until we talked to the folks standing in the line. 

It was interesting that everyone is only allowed to buy one cheesecake. The guy in front of me begged to be allowed to buy two and the answer was 'no'.  

Was the 45 minute queue worth it?   YES!   Japanese cheesecake is a different type of cheesecake. I tried it both when it was warm just out of the oven and when it was cold after being in the fridge overnight.  Both experiences were great.  It had the right amount of sweetness and was not heavy.  It was light and fluffy. 

I've had Japanese style cheesecake before and I have go say this was the best so far.  Wish they had a store in Boston."}
{"text":"MEH. 
It's fine, but it's definitely not worth the wait. The amount of time I would wait for this, had I known the taste beforehand, would be like MAXIMUM 10 minutes. And that's only if I was like suddenly craving a dessert akin to a sugary cheese cotton puff. It's almost TOO light. 

If anything was remotely satisfactory, it would be those non-madeleine looking madeleines. Buttery and tasty when starved (after waiting in line for 90 minutes) and when they're fresh out of the oven. But wait a couple of hours and those soft buttery cakes are equivalent in taste and texture to the wrapped, over processed madeleines you can get over at Starbucks for --- wait for it --- ZERO WAIT TIME! *applause*

All in all, don't go... Don't go. Don't go!
Unless you have a friend you want to catch up with in line and have nothing else worthwhile to do whatsoever. :)

BUT, gosh darnit, if you are as stubborn as mule, take a look at my pictures for more info on prices and times."}
{"text":"The fabled Uncle Tetsu location in Canada and his very hyped cheesecakes have finally been tasted. As with most foods with insane lineups and tons of rave reviews online (ex. Cronut), it is usually over-hyped.

I waited for an hour, and it wasn't too bad. It was extremely warm in the actual store, and when I had to wait twenty minutes for the new batch, I had started sweating. There is free wifi in the store and they openly give the password, so that helps to make the waiting time go by quicker.

Worth noting that the cheesecakes are made in batches of twelve, and every twenty minutes they are in rotation on an oven with three baking areas. (You could calculate how much longer to wait based on how many more people were ahead of you)

The taste of the cheesecakes were surprisingly fluffy and soft. It had a nice sweetness that didn't need anything added to it. You get the cheesecakes pretty warm (since they go straight from the oven to the box for you) and a man ahead in line said the cheesecakes are better the longer you wait. (Within the day)

Overall, it is similar to the T&T cheesecakes, but much different in taste. (I assume because the T&T ones are mass produced and in a fridge and this one is room temperature and well sort of mass produced now) Is it worth waiting an hour? Possibly if you are dying to get one, but they have a new matcha store right beside it, which might divert demand away from their original cheesecakes towards their new matcha cheesecakes."}
{"text":"Cheesecake tastes like egg foam. 
Madelines are no better than some cheap muffins from NoFrills.
I do not know why people bother standing in the line for hours for this."}
{"text":"The cheesecake here is good and different from most cheesecakes in the neighbourhood. It is light and almost fluffy compared to other cheesecakes. If you take it home and liven it up with some fresh fruit or less healthy favourite cheesecake topping, it becomes a bit better.

The question in many reviews revolves around waiting in line. Part of what makes Toronto a big city (aside from millions of people) is a drive we all have to be/find something unique among the masses. At the end of the day, whether we wait in line for a dance club, make-your-own ice cream bar, or a cheesecake tells us that we are in some way special or are at least having an experience that few others will have.

So should you wait in line here? Probably yes, because the very act of waiting in a line for something unique is re-tell able. It makes for great stories with friends. It allows you to ascribe value to a situation/experience that few will share. So...grab a friend you haven't seen in a while. Say, \"let's catch up while waiting in line at Uncle Tetsu's this weekend\". You will have fun and also enjoy some pretty decent cake."}
{"text":"Best cheesecake! Worth the wait! I guess the lineup shows how good the cheesecake is... the place has been opened for 2 years, there is still lineup everyday...."}
{"text":"Waited in line for about 50 minutes and was lucky enough to be the last one to get the cheesecake before it sold out. The customer service needs to step up their game and there needs to be more cashier on the front and more people working on making the cheesecake. So many people were waiting but unfortunately some didn't get it because they sold out. This one lady got so furious and I even offered her my ticket so she can get the cake but she refused and kept complaining to the girl who said they sold out. Her customer service was so bad, she kept staring at the lady who was complaining, i didn't even hear her apologize and all she said was that she needs to tell other people and the whole time she was just giving her bad looks and standing there saying nothing. They need to know how to deal with customers. Also, a lot of people kept coming in even though there was a sign at the corner but i guess they didn't see it. I got pissed and put it right in front of the door so people will know. This place is really overrated. You'll love the first two or three bites and after that you'll feel like vomiting because it's just too much. So this is like a one time experience and never again type of thing."}
{"text":"First time ever for me trying the Uncle Tetsu's Japanese Cheesecake. I heard so much about it. People always lining up just to get one. 
Or if you want more than one, they have a policy of if there is someone behind you, you have to go back at the end of the line to get your second. 
I waited 50min in line to get one. 

For me personally I didn't get the crazy excitement that everyone was mentioned how good it was etc. It was just ok for me. 

It was very soft and fluffy that's for sure. But it was just like as if I was eating a moist soft vanilla cake. For me personally it was a over rated when I ate it. My personal opinion....You go and eat it and make your personal opinion on it enjoy."}
{"text":"The wait was about 30 minutes but the reward was a nice freshly baked Japanese cheesecake. It's almost sponge cake like with a hint of tang from the cheese. Limit one per person. Wanted to try the matcha uncle Tetsu cafe next door however we already had two cakes on hand."}
{"text":"Everything made here is done VERY very well. They have a system, they follow it, and it's quality. 

The madeleines were super light and fluffy, and nothing like I've had before. The texture was enjoyable and interesting... but it didn't leave me craving more. The cheesecake too was airy and light tasting too. I think both seemed to lack a strong flavor which I was expecting.

I would go back and try their stuff again but in all honesty that line up is ridiculous. I know it's because they make everything fresh and it takes time to order but that line up kills any motivation for me to return soon. I'd rate their product 4 or 4.5 out of 5, but the overall experience was barely a 3/5."}
{"text":"Went in line at around 730pm after random decision to wait for uncle tetsu cheesecake. My gf had it last Friday and I knew my days of avoiding that line up is counted. Luckily we were in front of these two cool people we ended up chatting with and had a few laughs. Waited about 45 mins, 30 mins of which is in an oven of a store to get our cheesecake. There was a couple there that was on the next batch that just left which I assume it's because of the heat. Anyway ordered the Madeleine and cheesecake. The Madeleine were not impressive. Saw the amount of butter they put on that too. It was substantial. I found it dense and ordinary. I felt like I was eating a baked package corn bread. On to the cheesecake... It definitely backed up the hype. Fluffy smooth light cheesecake. Don't expect the density of an American cheesecake. I like this better. Not too sweet nor bland. Definitely made the wait worth it. If you wonder how long is the wait count 15 mins per 12 people. That's how slow they pump out cheesecake. The four star is not for the cheesecake but rather overall experience. Madeleines wasn't that good either."}
{"text":"The matcha cheesecake has a wonderful aroma.  The matcha and the cheese are well balanced.  But it is less airy and light as the original, and it tends to crumble and crack when I cut it."}
{"text":"The green tea matcha cheesecake with red bean is to die for! It is so so so good. I couldnt believe how yummy it was. And plus there is no line up to get it. That alone deserves 5 stars! The plain one is just that; plain. This one is mega matcha flavor. The red beans give it that kick that makes it 5 stars *****"}
{"text":"It's either you love it enough to go back for it
or (like myself) try it once and yes it is decent, but it didn't move my heart enough that I will wait minimum 1 hour in line (during busy times) to buy it."}
{"text":"Finally bit the bullet and waited in line.  It was worth the 15 minute wait but as an example of Japanese cheese it was a good rendition/version."}
{"text":"My future MIL - bless her, she actually went and got both the original and the matcha cheesecakes!! I've actually never eaten their cheesecake before since it's far and there's always lineups. Anyway I was so happy when she told my fiance to bring it home for us to eat.

Their cheesecake.. omg, it is SO GOOD. If you like creamy and moist cheesecakes, this one for you. the matcha also delicious - i loved both of their textures - if you microwave it for like 10 seconds, it almost taste like its fresh out of the oven!!!! :)

Anyway i love their cheesecake, but I\"ll see if i have any luck next time I go downtown lol. But I was very thankful for being able to try eating both of these cheesecakes and my fiance and I thoroughly enjoyed every single bite of these cheesecakes!"}
{"text":"OH. MY. GOD. While I realize I'm a bit late to the party (I don't do line ups). I happened to be in the area and despite my tendency towards all things matcha, I'd promised myself I'd \"just\" get the plain cheesecake. I was there around 11 a.m. on a Friday morning, I feel terrible for the staff though - it was a nice, cool morning but (even with the door propped open) it is as boiling hot as the inside of an oven. Definitely keeps one from loitering! There was NO LINE (!!!), just 1 person ahead of me (he was allowed to buy 3 cheesecakes - at once). I happily ordered my one cheesecake and then went next door (to the Uncle Tetsu's all things matcha shop) to get a Genmaicha tea. Which was very very good (note for those of you who are not familiar with the world of green tea - you should never let it steep longer than one minute as it will quickly become bitter). I proudly carried my much sought after Uncle Tetsu bag home where I thought I may as well try it (expecting that, after reading many, many reviews that it would taste like an egg or uncooked custard). HOLY YOWZA!!!!! It is like eating a cloud - only BETTER. Yeah, that's right. It's like if cheesecake wasn't going to sit like a rock in your gut and was going to have a little dance party on your tongue, this would be it. I'm absolutely sold. It tastes like cheesecake only better. WAAY better. Oh my god. This is going to be my go-to hostess gift (one for you, one for me). Oh, and how come not one reviewer mentioned that not only does the happy little cheesecake come with said Uncle Tetsu's face stamped onto it (do you want your face on cheesecake? People are eating your face? Hmm why not), but they also have this fabric type of material to wrap between the cheesecake and the cute little scallop edged box that it sits in. Lovely and amazing (like pretty much everything Japanese). I'd better start working out for 6 hours a day. At least."}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is all about. 
It taste like a normal Japanese cheesecake that you can get in Japan. Not to mention that T&T sells one that tastes the same, and the best part about it is that you don't have to wait hours to buy it! This place is overrated."}
{"text":"Great cake!! not very fullfiilling but its not the point.. the point is to enjoy the subtle flavours and texture which makes it totally worth it fluffy but moist, great balance of creamy, sugar, cheese. I enjoyed it a lot, try it hot for extra fluff and more intense flavor. After so long of finding the courage the make the lane, I did and it was definately worth it.. with that said I shared my cake with other people and I don't think they got the point of it.  they thought it was meh."}
{"text":"The famous uncle tetsu right at the heart and convenience of busy commuters looking for a treat going back home. This location is inside union station and usually the lineups aren't too bad. As people rush to go home, not a lot of people buy the cheesecake. 

Sometimes you might need to wait 10-20 minutes but nothing as bad as what the Bay Street location used to be. Only offers the original Japanese Cheesecake so no variety there - honestly just a quick stop before home to get your cake fill. 

Quality is just as good as the Bay location, no doubts there. I tend to come to this location more now just because it is right at the union so I can go home after buying the cake. Freshly made, sponge-cake type of feel, and in general the staff is also pretty nice too. 

Not much more to complain about it here - they have a good reputation as it is anyways so."}
{"text":"I don't understand the constant long line up at this place. In other country (China) people stopped giving to much hype to the cheesecake here. The price of 10 dollars isn't bad considering the cake is pretty tasty and it's made fresh on the spot. The line up is too ridiculous and not worth it for me personally to come back for another try."}
{"text":"I had an unemployed friend (with an empty schedule) wait in line to buy a cheesecake and some madaleines for me as I promised I would pay for his bar tab later that night for this party we were planning to go to, as he is an alcoholic.  He waited nearly 2 hours playing Bejewelled and Tindering unsuccessfully on his cellphone in line before being able to buy this cheesecake and madaleines. 

There was nothing spectacular about this cheesecake.  It's merely a spongecake that can be bought at the T & T supermarkets or any other bakery in Chinatown up the road from this location.  Anybody who willingly waits this long (2 hours or at least 20 minutes for that matter) for this cheesecake is a moron and should not biologically reproduce or have any children including my friend, the unemployed alcoholic. This would further help with the overpopulation problem."}
{"text":"I got the original cheesecake and tried it when it was still warm. Didn't like it at all. It is so soft and puffy but in terms of the taste , it was like an omelette with lot of eggs with a little bit sugar.... seriously the egg flavor dominates... very moderate! I don't know why there is always a line-up. I had to wait for 40 minutes too. When I put it in fridge and tried it when it got cold, tasted better! It was first and last time..."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about?I guess if you want this type of dessert it is hard to find so perhaps that's the reason for the line up? It isn't very sweet, its kind of bland  - its more of an angel food cake with lots of cream cheese whipped into it. its unique for sure, just not sure I would go again.. They only take cash, only 1 per customer (about 10$ each)"}
{"text":"This place is a tiny factory! There is always a lineup to get it, and they make delicious Cheesecakes for $10 (real inexpensive for quality). Did I mention very delicious? It's really best eaten warm (some like it cold) and will melt in your mouth! They also have delicious Honey Madeleine and tarts! Must try!"}
{"text":"I disagree with half of the reviews here. It's a typical Japanese cheesecake and you really cannot compare it to New York cheesecake at all. Completely different beast. The cake is quite good if you understand that you are coming to eat Japanese cheesecake. It is similar to a souffle when warm, so put it in a fridge for it to taste more like a cheesecake. Luckily, the hype is dying and the line ups seem to be minimal. I would definitely not recommend lining up for this cake.

Also, please refrain from comparing it to T&T's cake. T&T is a good option if you don't want to wait in line, but the cake from Uncle Tetsu is a lot better. I also have to thank Uncle Tetsu for inspiring me to make my own Japanese cheesecake at home. I have to agree that the ingredients are not that cheap and maybe $10 is not too terrible. But I am still bothered that they are charging tax on a whole cake when every single bakery does not charge for it."}
{"text":"Uncle Tetsu Cheesecake originates from Japan and has locations in Taiwan, Australia and a couple in the US. The first Canadian store  opened on Bay Street in Toronto. Lineups and waits are part of the experience. In a way, on a smaller scale, it has the appeal of the Kusama Infinity Mirrors exhibit currently at the Art Gallery of Ontario.

The only locations in Canada are in the GTA - four in Toronto and one in Markham.

On this occasion I visited the store in the York Concourse at Union Station on a late afternoon. Remarkably there were only two in line and a fresh stack of cheesecakes were ready.

The cheesecake is very dense and sweet. It's not my cup of tea in terms of deserts but I wanted to give it a try.

They have other items like madeleines. 

If you don't mind the lineups and a pricey cake it might be worth a visit."}
{"text":"1) if you've had real soft serve green tea ice cream in HK or Japan don't expect the same quality here. You will be extremely disappointed. The portion served is also inconsistent. 
2) the matcha cupcakes were good, but overpriced and not worth over $2 a pop. 
3) there is no reason for me to step foot in this over priced and over rated establishment."}
{"text":"I don't see what the hype is about....Their cheesecake is okay. I prefer the green tea over the regular. The muffin I got was really dry and had no flavor. Yeah nothing special really."}
{"text":"Honestly, I have no idea what the big deal is here. You wait a long time for a small piece of fluffy cheesecake. Don't get me wrong, it tastes good but it's not worth the hour long wait to get it. If you go during down times where there's no line, I would say give it a try. Otherwise, don't bother."}
{"text":"Honestly, the hype is just way overkill for this place. I don't get it. I don't get it at all. Why do people line up for hours for this place?

Don't get me wrong, I like the cheesecakes. I much prefer them over the standard western cheesecakes. The flavours are lighter, more delicate, and the texture is more akin to a sponge cake. I would never refuse a slice of Tetsu's cake, but it's definitely not something I'd crave either, and certainly not line up for hours for.

It's neat to see them constantly coming up with new things though. Keeps things fresh and interesting."}
{"text":"The matcha cheesecake is very airy yet creamy. Not too sweet. Good price as well. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Order: Original Cheesecake 

PROS 
+ TASTE: Absolutely delicious. I'm so glad that Asian food trends are making their way to Toronto. I love cheesecake and the sponge-yness of this cake doesn't take away from the cream cheese flavor. 

CONS 
- LINE: Damn that line. I thought it was a short line until I was re-directed so as to not block car traffic. Fortunately, they have a good system in place. There's a girl that stands outside to answer questions/ensure you're in the right line. I was also notified that it would be a half an hour wait in advance. And only one per person :( 
- LIMITED SPACE: No seating space to consume the delicacies in their store. Def a grab-and-go kind of thing. 

I have passed the Uncle Tetsu shop on many occasions in the past few months. Finally, I had an extra second (or hour, rather) to see what the hype was all about. Fortunately, the line went by quickly since I was sniffing the delectable-ness that I would soon consume. While the wait was expected (and a tad bit annoying), it was well worth it and all the staff work in sync to provide you with the quickest possible service. If you're a foodie, def make a stop here :)"}
{"text":"Honestly the only good reason for us trying Uncle Tetsu is FOMO. Walked past Uncle Tetsu on our way to getting some gelato and was stopped dead in our tracks by the line because why is there a line if it's is not AMAZING. After some yelping my fiancé found it hilarious that there was a one cake per person policy and the wait began. It took us maybe 35 minutes to get to the front of the line. We came to realize that the line is purely engineered. They make the cake as they are being ordered. Each batch makes 12 cakes and when those 12 cakes are ready, they allow people in line to buy them. Then and only then does the line start to move. After those 12 cakes sell out the process starts over again. 

They only had original cake when we went and I'm not sure when the matcha cakes happen but would love to try those. The cake was nice and warm when we got it and smelled so good. We didn't get to eat it until a couple hours later and only after lugging it throughout the city. It was way better than I imagined after reading the comments. The cake was not dry and was slightly moist. That being said don't expect it to taste like the typical western cheesecake. The Japanese cheese cakes tend to taste more cakey and I like to think tastes a little similar to pound cake. If it wasn't 10 o'clock at night when we finally sat down to eat the cake I would have definitely ate it all in one sitting. 

That being said, this is definitely worth a try if you enjoy pound cake like cake, you're curious, have a lot of time or have constant FOMO. And if you just have time and want to line up, feel free to buy me some cake :)"}
{"text":"After spending the time lining up at the cheesecake store, I couldn't resist also checking out the new matcha cafe right next door. I went for the matcha soft cream and the matcha madeleines. Maybe I went in with too much expectations since I haven't found a place that serves matcha soft cream ever since I came back from Japan. The soft serve was a slight disappointment. I didn't find the matcha taste to be strong enough. To me, it tastes like 80% vanilla and 20% green tea. 

The madeleines were alright. Worth a try, but nothing too special. That being said, I'm really looking forward to the Matcha cheesecake they'll have in August! I'll definitely be visiting again when they start selling those!"}
{"text":"Update: Ok so now, I have tried the dome shaped one and that is MUCH better! Has a bit more of a creamy and cheesy flavour to the spongecake. I would give this a 4 star and the one I reviewed below, a 3 star.

It's ok. I tried the regular version. It is basically like a fluffy spongecake. I don't really taste the cheese."}
{"text":"After the dinner, my boyfriend took me to Uncle Tetsu's Japanese Cheesecake Store. Uncle Tetsu's Japanese Cheesecake is a famous dessert store downtown Toronto. There are many locations in Toronto. The one we've been is at The Bay St Downtown Toronto. Because of the location, lots of people have been to this store to buy cheesecakes.  In this way, it always has a big line up.

We arrived at the Uncle Tetsu's Japanese Cheesecake Store right after dinner time. It was late. It's not too many people there. We got into the store very fast. We only bought one $10 cheesecake to go.  All the cheesecakes and cupcakes made with freshly harvested eggs and high-quality butter and cream cheese.  The cheesecake was warm and fresh. The taste of the cheesecake was different from many other cheesecakes. It was super soft and not sweet. A little bit over the prices. If you travel to Toronto, you should have a try."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was last May (2015) when the hype was at it's peak. I waited 2 hours to get to purchase the cheesecake that everyone was talking about.

I recently came here on the weekend and noticed that the hype seems to have died down. It was surprising to be able to get a cheesecake within a 10 minute timeframe.

As for the cheesecake itself, I noticed that not much has changed since then and that's ok. The cake is very different than the typical Western cheesecake fare. 
It is very soft and it has a buttery taste that's not too sweet. It feels like you're biting into a tasty cloud.

I've also tried the Matcha one too which I didn't like as much despite my love for all things matcha. The lineup is definitely smaller on the Matcha cake side too.

On a final note, it's about 10 dollars for a 6-inch cake which is a bit on the pricey side.
However, it does a decent job of being filling as it's quite rich. I was satisfied with two slices.

Is it worth waiting more than 10 minutes for? Probably not.
Will you like it more than \"regular\" cheesecake? Depends but it is worth trying out at least once as I am confident it has a taste unlike anything you've ever had before."}
{"text":"Came back to pick up their original cheesecake and honey Madeleines for my BF's friend! As I was in line I noticed the Angel Hat was still available but in limited quantities... Around 5 left well 4 after I bought one! I've never tried the Angel Hat since they were always sold out every since it was added to the menu. I've had their original cheesecake and honey Madeleines many times and even their matcha cheesecake but never the Angel Hat! 

It looks like a fluffy dome! My first bite into it and you can tell the cake was so fluffy and light! When it enters your mouth it magically disappears! It's so light that it melts away! My friends and I were amazed! It's like airy and cheesier compared to the cheesecake! Definitely something to try if you've never had it! 

I was glad I didn't have to wait for more than 10 minutes to get one! I guess I was lucky!!"}
{"text":"Over. Rated.

It's good cheesecake, don't get me wrong... but it's extremely overrated.  If you have 1 - 2 hours to kill, and honestly have nothing better to do at all, then give it a try."}
{"text":"I've been to this shop twice during two different stays in Toronto. If you live in America like me, only Canadian Cards, Canadian cash, and American cash are accepted. (I've tried to use my Visa card and it was denied.) This is BY FAR the best cheesecake I've eaten...and I'm a Junior's Cheesecake (Brooklyn, NYC) fan! The cheesecake is best eaten while it's still hot. 

If you're traveling from Canada back to America via bus (e.g. Megabus), you're allowed to take this back to America. You can't bring this dessert on the airplane with you. I usually request for my hotel to place it in the freezer for me until it's time for me to leave. 

Oh--and as I have learned from some of the  individuals who work here, it's best to purchase your cheesecake Monday - Thursday mornings. Any other timeframe beyond this will have you waiting in 2+ hour lines just to get a cheesecake. (I've been in that long line at night before....the cheesecake is that good!)"}
{"text":"Incredibly average Japanese cheesecake and Madeleine's. I suppose it's good that they're all freshly from the oven but the wait time is obscene. But perhaps it's cause I'm from Hong Kong and japanese cheesecakes of this quality are a dime a dozen there.

Tl;dr you will be disappointed if you've had japanese cheesecake anywhere else before"}
{"text":"All aboard the hype train. 

Naturally, with all the attention this place has been getting I had to go see what all the fuss was about. $10 for a cheese flavoured sponge cake. For this price it had better be worth it. When you eat it fresh it is very nice and soft with almost a creamy inside. Tasted very good.

However, this is probably the last time I will have this cake. Its sure as hell is not worth $10 in my opinion and to wait in line for extended periods just to have a flavoured sponge cake is sure not worth the time and effort. 

Someone had got it for me so I'm glad I didn't have to wait outside in the cold.

Overall, I would say it is worth trying out if you have never tried it before but don't expect to be blown away because at the end of the day it really is just a sponge cake.

So everyone just needs to exit the hype train and go eat something else that's better because there is always better :)"}
{"text":"I've now tried Uncle Tetsu cheesecake twice, and I just can't get into it.

I've always been an avid cheesecake chomper so I was eager to try this place, but be warned that it's not your average cheesecake. That's not to say it's \"bad\" per se, it just wasn't my style. The japanese cheesecake is much more of a souffle with a very eggy taste. The texture is quite soft and pillowy too. It was decent for a bite or two, but I couldn't commit to a whole slice. It's just not the firm, cheesy, sinful cake that I love. Call me a fatty, I'm okay with it.

Also, an hour wait? Really? If the cheesecake hadn't been purchased for my office by somebody with clearly much more time on their hands than I do, I would never wait an hour for a slice of sweet eggs. 

Overrated."}
{"text":"I was lucky to only wait for half an hour in the summer. I've been dying to try Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake bec of all the big hype about it. The cheesecake is not your regular kind. It's light & fluffy and I love that it's not too sweet. It's best served chilled with Greaves strawberry jam with warm latte. The taste & experience is 5 star! And yes, it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"After 2 hours in a line I finally stepped inside the shop to wait my turn. What I found in the shop was a well developed cooking process. People making the cheese cake batter another putting the fresh cooked cheese cake in boxes and another attending the oven. The cheese cake were coming out of the oven and within a minute or two making it into a box and out the shop in someone's hands. What I found strange was the number of cheesecakes coming out of the oven every 20 mins. It seemed to me like they did not want to sell too many cheesecakes as only 12 to 15 were coming out every 20-25 minutes thus a 2 - 3 hour wait time. One more oven and the wait time would drop by 1/4 the wait time. The shop has a lot of room and could double the production but does not, which to me was irritating. 

On the other hand the cake itself was amazing. Nothing like any other cheesecake I have had. I do recommend trying it out when the lines are shorter! I did not appreciate the fact that there can easily be more cakes cooked with more ovens but the shop is not expanding."}
{"text":"Lined up with my friend for about 2 hours for an opportunity to try the highly raved cheesecake. I am surprised that the line is still so incredibly long, even though the shop has been opened for months. Lots of others in line seemed to be getting snacks from the matcha store next door (also owned by Uncle Tetsu) while waiting in line for the real thing.
After trying the cake, I was not very impressed. However, we tried it maybe an hour after purchasing it, when it was still warm. My boyfriend described it, \"as though I'm eating air.\" It was so light it melted in our mouths. I was told by a friend to try it after leaving it in the fridge overnight. Definitely better, however I was still not impressed, particularly after devoting 2 hours of my life waiting in line for it. The madeleines were also alright, they were like mini muffins. Nothing spectacular. I can't understand the hype that surrounds this store.
Tried it since everyone keeps talking about it, but I would not recommend it unless you have someone to keep company/entertain you for a couple of hours.

My recommendation to the store would be to bake some cheesecakes in the matcha store to help supply the original store (they're connected) in order to speed up the line, as the matcha store is not nearly as busy. I hope they're considering options to increase efficiency, perhaps it would sway me to try it once more."}
{"text":"I finally got to see why Japanese cheesecakes are so hyped!! I came in around 9 AM on a Wednesday and it was empty with only a bunch of workers working hard to produce tons of cheesecakes. I ordered the original cheesecake ($10 exactly) and received my cake right away. It was still warm and smelled soooo good. 

The cheesecake itself was a little soggy and the cloth they use to cover it kind of ruined the appearance of it. 

It was pretty good, light and fluffy! It's kind of like an angel cake or sponge cake with the taste of a cheesecake. You could honestly eat the whole cake by yourself if you wanted to. 

With no more crazy lineups, I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is the most addictive japanese cheesecake.

Is it worth lining for? If youre really craving it, yes. But they do have down times, just go at those times

I dont think they deserve a lower rating because of their cash only payment, and line ups.

I do agree that they could improve on efficiency, but I wouldnt trade that for quality.

Overall, 5 stars for a great tasting cake!"}
{"text":"It's expensive and the lineup is long but what a treat! I stood outside in the cold for this and it was totally worth it. I ate it in the atrium across the street fresh and warm. Bring a fork, napkin and a drink and be ready for some unique deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Uncle Tetsu, seems to be filled with mixed reviews and unfortunately I am going to say I was disappointed. 

Sunday afternoon, lineup was short and waited about 20-30 minutes. The staff were efficient at what they do, so the wait wasn't bad at all. 

Cheesecake was 10.00$ and Madeleines were 2.50$ each or Buy 3 get 1 free (7.50$). I thought it was fairly priced and was excited to try it out once I got home. 

Cheesecake, it's texture was soft and very light as expected. It tasted OK but nothing that I would crave. Later on, my stomach started to hurt (I didn't eat anything out of the ordinary that day, so it was definitely the cheesecake). Before going into detail, yes it caused a trip to the washroom. 

Madeleines, tasted similar to the Cakes you can purchase at Asian supermarkets like T&T but more expensive. It was OK, tasted good but again, nothing special. 

Conclusion, from the time I purchased the cheesecake to when I got home (about 1 hour to trek back uptown) it got spoiled. I was not the only one feeling sick, my sister who also tried it had stomach problems. Not sure what it was but all the hype was simply just \"hype\" and in my case, extreme disappointment. 

Sorry Uncle Tetsu, I will not be giving you any more business as clearly my stomach does not agree with your cheesecakes."}
{"text":"I figured surely there cant still be lines to get a cheesecake at Uncle Tetsu still, right? I was wrong. I could see the line as I was approaching the store. I've been in Toronto long enough to know that when you see a line, you get in the line and then try to figure out what the line is for...unlike some other people who kinda just walked by, thinking they could just waltz right into the shop only to realize what the line was for and had to double back... hah! 

I saw that there were at most maybe 15 people in line, and so I assumed that meant I would get into the shop soon. Right? No, I was wrong. It took about 40 minutes for me standing in line to get to the door. Just went I thought that meant the wait was over, apparently, I had to wait some more for the next batch of cheesecakes to be ready...The smell was very good though. At least I had that while waiting in line =)

OK, so how was it? It's good. Very soft and light. It tastes a little eggy and spongy to me. And it's barely sweet (which I like). Verdict: I'll eat it again if one happens to be in front of me. I don't know that I would stand in line again though.

People keep telling me that I could have just walked to Union Station and avoid the line there. That's definitely another option."}
{"text":"def good but not worth the wait. i would probably wait 15~30 mins for this but not 2 hours."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a weekday, so the wait was about two minutes. During those two minutes, I was filled with the anxiety of decision-making. A cheesecake seemed like too much but I also wanted to try everything else. We ended up buying a cheesecake, cheesecake cookies, a cheese tart, and a madeline. My boyfriend didn't like the madeline as much as I did. It tasted fluffy and lighter than a regular madeline. The cheese tart was really, really rich and tasty but I could only manage one bite. Everyone seemed to really like the cheesecake. It was probably the best Japanese cheesecake I've ever had. I wouldn't be willing to wait in line for more than 15 minutes for it, though."}
{"text":"Worst cheesecake I have ever eaten!  Don't wast your time. Just walk by and take a smell, If it smells off to you don't go in because they taste just like they smell...
Don't believe the hype!"}
{"text":"This place is so unique, and the cheesecake is a must try! Right by the bus terminal, so if you're visiting the city, check it out! You may have to wait in a line outside the store though as they have verrrrrry limited space."}
{"text":"I don't really have anything to compare when it comes to Japanese cheesecake since I've never been to Japan or had very authentic Japanese cheesecake. What I do know is that it's lighter than \"western\" cheesecake and that it's kinda spongelike. Regardless, this is probably my new favourite kind of cheesecake. It's so light and fluffy and delicious. Not overly sweet and it's only $10! I went to the store on Sunday morning around 9:30 and there was only 2 or 3 people in line so I decided to get 2 (you have to buy one, receive the cake then line up again to buy a second one since they limit 1 per person at a time). I definitely wouldn't have done it if they had the usual long line but I lucked out. The cashier was super nice and she was very polite and apologetic about the rules which I'm assuming because she gets a lot of shit for (Be nice to her ppl! She's just doing her job). Another thing is they only accept cash or debit. I'll definitely be back if there's no line up :D"}
{"text":"It's good but not great. If you are waiting more then 15 minutes then you waited too long.

Its all a hype. Go early in the morning so you don't have to wait 1hour + for one cake."}
{"text":"Amazing cheesecake, I really enjoyed the matcha one. 
I was in Toronto last year and they had a matcha bread filled with red beans, it was amazing and that's why I decided to go back. They didn't have those but the cheesecake was excellent! 
I didn't have to line up, I went on a weekday during the morning.."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about Uncle Tetsu's Cheesecake and most of it were mixed feelings. You either really loved it or you were just very indifferent. Nobody who i spoke to hated it, so that's a good thing :)
When I first got here, I had to wait because the line ups were pretty huge ( around 40 minutes)  but the wait was well worth it. 
As someone previous said, the cake is different compared to the quintessential New York Cheesecake. This was half pound cake and half regular cheese cake. I didn't think it would work but boy was it great. Light, but not too light and not too rich.
My only flaw with this place is that you have to order a whole cake, you can't just buy a slice but, the price is worth it ($10)"}
{"text":"Yes, I waited in line for 30min for Japanese Cheesecake! and no, I am not the least bit upset about it either! You should try it too, do you have something better to do? Don't walk, RUN! 

Warm, fresh out the oven, creamy, delicious cheesecakey goodness.

nom nom nom"}
{"text":"I personally think the Cheesecake and the Madeleines are worth the wait. Although it is 1 Cheesecake per customer so bring a friend! Staff are super friendly."}
{"text":"Not really cheesecake.  Tastes like egg custard.  Very over hyped.  Would not wait more than 15 minutes.  We got lucky and did not have to wait to long to get one."}
{"text":"We got the Original Japanese Cheesecake, Cheese Tart, Chocolate Tart, and Honey Madeleines - they were all delicious! We had to wait 10-20 minutes, but it was worth it. Fair prices for what you get. The cheesecake was an amazing, fluffy, and light texture but was still decadent and rich. The cheese tart was yummy and exactly what you'd expect, but my favorite was the chocolate tart - I had it with a strawberry the next day and it was soooo good. The Honey Madeleines were good, but I'd rather get more cheesecake or cheese tarts."}
{"text":"Located right in the union station it's very convenient for the ppl going home from work and taking the go train.

Came on a Tuesday afterwork around 5pm. I sometimes go to see if there's a line and to my surprise there was just one person and still cakes left. I would never line up for this cake.

By now I think everyone's tried it. It's okay. Not a bad snack. Also for the price it's meh. $10 tax in and you get a cake around 7 inches. When it's fresh it smells good. It by the time you bring it home it's just a fluffy sponge cake. Not worth the hype. But would buy it as a snack if there was no line up. I believe it's cash only. Ppl working there seem like university kids that don't give a crap."}
{"text":"I completely lucked out last weekend with the lineup being only 45 minutes long. Yes, if the lineup is less than an hour, I would suggest you go for it because the average waiting time is close to 2 hours.

Since this place is extremely popular, there are a couple of rules every single customer must follow, such as the fact you can't purchase more than one cheesecake and you have to be in line in order to be brought inside, since they count how many people are allowed inside at once for the cheesecakes.

You can easily smell that distinct Japanese cheesecake aroma once you get inside the store. Enjoy it while it lasts, because the employees are quick in chasing you out once your purchase is complete.

The cheesecake here is extremely fluffy, which is a drastic opposite to the New York cheesecake you may be familiar with. Some may be complaining about a lack of taste, but that's what Japanese cheesecake is supposed to taste like. Mild, light dessert, fluffy...exactly like how Uncle Tetsu does it.

I've never been a fan of lineups of over an hour, and I would certainly not lineup here if that was the case. However, if the sign indicates a lineup of 60 minutes or less, go for it! It won't get shorter than that, and you can tell your friends you've eaten at Uncle Tetsu."}
{"text":"Love this place. Not a fan of western cheesecakes as it's quite heavy. But this light and fluffy Japanese version is a wonderful melt in your mouth experience. Pretty good $10 spent on dessert."}
{"text":"You will get in line. The line may move quickly, it may move slowly. In the end you'll get to the end of the line and pay $10. You'll get a pretty box in a pretty bag. You cannot pay $20 and get two. If you wish for two, you must get back in line. 

Inside that box you'll find a small wheel. This wheel is pure happiness.  The cheesecake is rich and flavourful and delicious. Eat it slowly. Share it with your friends. It will soon disappear. 

Then, you will get back in line again..."}
{"text":"I have finally tried both the cheesecake and madeline cookies from Uncle Tetsu. As others have mentioned, you have to line up because the shop is so small and you're only allowed to buy one cheesecake/four madelines at a time.

*Cheesecake*
Quite reasonable as it's about $10 after tax. It's super light that you can easily eat the entire cake in one sitting. Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake is quite fluffy; even leaving it in the fridge for a night didn't change its state. The packaging that the cake comes in is quite cute that it would be a nice gift to take to someone. I thought that the face of Uncle Tetsu burnt on the cake was cute too.

*Madeline*
Nothing to write home about here. The madelines that I've had in Japan are much smaller and more flavorful. You can definitely skip this.

I'm torn on this review as I found the cheesecake to be good, but I can't justify waiting in line for an hour to buy only one of them. The cheesecake (more like souffle) is just as good at other bakeries, including Mon K Patisserie. 

Good for: cheesecake

NB - 
Cash ONLY.
One cheesecake per customer.
Four madeline cookies per customer."}
{"text":"We have purchased their cheesecakes on at least 5 difference occasions since they opened.  

In all those times, the quality, presentation, and taste  of the cheesecakes have been consistently good.  In addition, the cheesecakes have always been very fresh, coming right out of the oven and immediately boxed for us, fresh and hot, each time.  

The only difference between now and when we first purchased these cheesecakes is the line up.  We no longer have to wait over an hour to get a cheesecake."}
{"text":"Waited two hours in the cold for our try of delicious cheesecake and I don't think I would wait that long again. Remember it's cash only. The cake was good but not worth that long of a wait. Can't wait until they expand with different flavour cheesecakes though! Yumm green tea!"}
{"text":"I never waited for this but man is the cheesecake delicious. No words to describe it. If given the opportunity would I line up for it personally? Helllll no but I would certainly pa a little extra to the people at front so I could cut in line AND pay for their cheesecakes. That's how good it is."}
{"text":"As a huge fan of cheesecake, I had to try Uncle Tetsu's! When I arrived here after work, there was already a line out the door. I thought, this cheesecake better be worth waiting out in the cold (and it was). I also enjoyed getting to watch them make the cheesecakes.

I got my cheesecake fresh out of the oven, and even though I didn't get to eat it till later that night - I still found that it was the fluffiest, lightest cake I've ever had. It was so yum! This cheesecake has to be one of the best deals. For only $10 and a bit of a wait, you get a taste of a really soft, moist, and flavourful cake. It's simple but delicious!

The only con is that the cakes are limited to one per person. I'd love to try the matcha version next time!

Update: To my disappointment, I just found out they stopped selling matcha cheesecakes. I'll be back here for the original though!"}
{"text":"I had no idea there were long lines/waits to get this cheesecake.... I just happened upon it on my way out of town in the station and walked right up... nobody around and no limits.. buy them all if you want... I should've bought two! (It was around 4pm on a Sunday)

You have to know what to expect with a Japanese cheesecake or you might be disappointed.  I think the lower reviews here are rating on simply whether or not they like the cheesecake.  I am giving it five stars because as Japanese cheesecakes, or Japanese cakes/bakeries go in general, this is as good as it gets!  I was excited to stumble upon it because we lived in Yokohama years ago and this was my favorite treat.  I prefer less sweet, lighter desserts overall.  If you're a NYC cheesecake fan or a double sugar in your coffee kind of person, you might not like this very much.

Here's my tip:  eat some right away, while it's warm, if possible but as fresh as possible for certain.  Then refrigerate and try again the next day.  It's like two different cakes.  Some prefer day of, some prefer day after... I like both equally."}
{"text":"If I could save time in a bottle, I'd definitely save it to spend with loved ones who have passed on. Not having that ability, and with time being a precious commodity, I shirk at waiting on long lines for anything, especially overhyped food. And is the cheesecake here overhyped? Absolutely not. One bite means tasting dreamy, sweet creamy cheese with a cloud like texture that just melts in your mouth. The cheesecake isn't overly sweet, and disappears like a memorable dream on your tongue, making you wanting more. I'm already thinking of visiting Toronto again to load up on the cheesecake!

So if you want your time and have your cake too, come early. I came at early morning out of curiosity and popped in for a slice for my friend and myself and found out there were no slices and, lo and behold, there was no line at all! But a hike at High Park was in my plans, which meant excuses to eat the whole cheesecake. So I also found out by asking the sweet counter people that you can go to Uncle Tetsu's Angel Café on Dundas Street if I saw lines here, go  upstairs and just get a cake to take out, which I did a day later. Silly Yelpers, save your time! The cheesecakes are small(5.5 inches), and due to their airiest, size and taste,may compel you to devour the whole thing, especially if you get it hot. I believe you can only get one, though at slow times, what stops you from going in and out if you want more? Time to bring out the wig you've been storing for Halloween. This creamy delight is packed in a box that fits perfectly and protected with a thin layer of foam. The cute Uncle Tetsu logo is stamped on the cake. 

This bakery does sell other cakes that look good and have cute names and probably taste as great as this one, and also sells cookies, but it's the cheesecake that's the draw. I didn't look really; I wanted the cheesecake people waited patiently on long lines for. Even the airport staff remarked on my Uncle Tetsu bag with the cake inside as I was leaving Canada. Taste this remarkably delicious cheesecake for yourself and find out why the customs people laughed knowingly when the plastic container carrying my bags got shifted to a different conveyor belt  for hand inspection and I exclaimed, \"But my cheesecake is there!\" No sir, please don't you take my Uncle Tetsu cheesecake out of my sight and belly."}
{"text":"First time eating Japanese style cheesecake. Was delicious! Reminds me of a heavy cream cheese flavored chinese style sponge cake. Cheesecake can be split between 3-4 people.

Don't waste your money on their green tea soft serve ice cream.It was pretty bad! Not enough matcha taste. Recommend to walk a few blocks down to Tsujiri."}
{"text":"Ordered the Matcha Cheese Tart ($3.50+tax).  

The cheese tart was creamy and had the \"cheesey\" flavour with a hint of matcha flavour!  The crust is super crunchy/hard. I'm not a fan of the crust though. It can be less hard. I was having trouble biting it. I would much prefer the Chinese Egg Tart hard shell crust instead (not the flakey ones).  

I tried their cheesecake before and I am IN LOVE! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting a cheesecake ($10 including tax). It is the BEST cheesecake I ever had!!! It was SUPPPPPPERRRRR fluffly and airy! Mind blown!! 

Vancouver will soon have Uncle Tetsu cheesecake store, and I am waiting impatiently!! 

I recommend eating it when it's freshly out of the oven! It becomes like a regular (still very yummy) hard cheesecake texture the next few days. I can't wait to buy it again!!! 

I prefer their cheesecake over their cheese tart."}
{"text":"It's unpopular opinion time!  I really don't think this place is very good.  In fact, there are large parts that I actively dislike.  You can read all the great wonderful stuff in all the other reviews, but check it out - here we go.

The Wait:
So, 11am on a Tuesday, I waited for an hour.  To be fair, it could have only been 40 minutes, if not for the girl who ran in squealing to be with her friend who had waited without her.  This girl came in, ordered a cheesecake, and giggled her way out.

It should be noted that until this point, I was #12 in line.  She pushed me to #13.  The is important because they only make 12 cakes at a time.  Rather than having my cheese cake and being on my way, I was stuck waiting for another 25 minutes for the first of the following batch.

Now, I have no problem waiting around, and my review doesn't take that into account.  That's just something people should be aware of.

The Staff:
They're just quiet little worker bees going about their business, saying nothing to anyone.  Which must be weird, as people who have waited in long lines, and just got inside, are glaring into their souls, waiting for the next batch to come out of the overs.  

When I was there there were six people working.  I say working, because I think they were being paid, but really they just stand around.  Every 20 minutes they get together, do something, and then stand around a lot.  This place could be run by 2 people, and needs no more than 3.  It's odd, but hey - job creation is important.  I think it's bad business, but I don't fault it.

I don't even fault the fact that they don't have enough ovens to meet demand, because obviously a big part of this place is the status of being seen carrying the bag around, because it says, \"I waited.\"  It's what makes diamonds so popular.  Without artificial scarcity there'd be no buzz.

But my review doesn't take that into account either.

The Cheesecake (and other things):
Yup.  That sure it cheesecake.  It's $10 after tax, so that's a fair price.  It's nothing special though.  It's kind of bland.  It would make a nice base for something that has flavour, I'm sure.  But as it is, it's just... a thing.  If I could walk up to the counter, pay ten bucks without waiting, and be off - would I care?  No.  I would not.  It's just not very good.

But wait - they have other baked products.  The Marigolds (or whatever they're called.  Little muffin things.)  I wondered if people had to wait in line if they just wanted those, no cheesecake, but couldn't be bothered to ask.  

As I bit into one of them, I realized something upsetting: Boy was I glad I just bought one, and not the bag of four that everyone else seemed to grab.  They were TERRIBLE.  They were incredibly dry, and once more, without flavour.  It sure was a baked good, but it wasn't a good one.

Overall:
So - the price was fine.  The wait was ridiculous.  The food was not so great.

Would I go back?  No.  Not with those lines.  Would I go back, without a line?  Probably not.  If it was in front of me, would I have a small slice?  Of course.  The cheesecake, anyway.  At the end of the day, it's still cheesecake...  Keep the Marigolds far away from me, though.

Should you go?  Depends - do you want to carry the bag around, and tell people that you've been?  Sure.  Do it.  Do you really like bland Japanese cheesecake?  Then you'll love this, I'm sure.

Otherwise, I'd say stay away.  Check back in a few months when the hype is gone.

Seriously: 12 cakes, every 20-25 minutes.  If there are twenty five people in front of you, you're waiting an hour.  Be prepared."}
{"text":"Cheesecake to die for but not ur usual recipe fluffy like a regular white cake 
Anticipate a line up
Portions small"}
{"text":"Favorite cheesecake place in Toronto! The cake is fluffy and melts in your mouth. I highly recommend you to eat it the same day or else it won't taste as great when you microwave it a few days later."}
{"text":"Very good. A nice change from your typical cheesecake.

Put the cheesecake in the fridge after you've bought it (and let it cool down). Then eat it after a couple hours in the fridge. It's much better when it's more firm. 

Not a bad size for $8.88. It's creamy (light) and not too sweet. Worth a visit when there's no line-up."}
{"text":"I'm not a cheesecake fan, so i can't speak for the cheesecake, but I am a fan of the honey madeleines!!

This is a small, tiny bakery. When I went (~11 AM on a Tuesday), there was no line. The honey madeleines are light and spongy without being overwhelmingly sweet (or as Scott Conant in Chopped says - \"cloyingly sweet\", ha!). Yummy and worth a stop if you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I ordered the green tea shaved ice (with red bean add on), as well as tried the green tea ice cream. Both were quite disappointing.

The shaved ice had no flavour and was really bland; I am glad I paid the extra dollar to add the red bean, or else I wouldn't have been able to finish it.

The green tea ice cream was also pretty mediocre, it did not have that creamy texture that I would expect; it was almost watery.

I think it is best to stick to uncle tetsu's cheesecakes."}
{"text":"Went yesterday a for the first and got the Honey Madeleine. Decided not to get the full cheesecake because I had to walk around downtown and didn't want to carry a cheesecake with me. 

But the little cupcake that I bought was AMAZING. It wasn't overly sweet, and had a hint of honey with every bite I took. Definitely reminded me of homemade cupcakes. 

The only reason why my review lost one star was for the price. The little cupcake was $2.21 plus tax ($2.50 in total). Just a tad bit expensive for a small cupcake..."}
{"text":"Uncle Tetsu's Cheesecake is insanely creamy and basically melts in your mouth. Most of the time there is a large lineup of people (you can only buy 1 cake per person) so expect a slight delay. If you aren't used to smelling sweet stuff for long periods, you may get a slight headache when you are inside the actual building."}
{"text":"We drove by the bakery today and saw a short line up ( of 8 people)? I quickly got out of the car when my husband parked. It was a hot Summer day, and I was drenched by the time I placed my order. We felt lucky we only waited 20 minutes or so, compared to the 2 hour wait we keep hearing about. The cheesecake was definitely a lighter alternative to the traditional western cheesecakes; it was tasty, fluffy, and did not leave us with a guilty after taste."}
{"text":"Okay, the line sucks, especially in the middle of winter. It's not as bad as it used to be, when people lined up for hours for a single cheese cake. But it still takes some getting used to, when other bakeries make all the stock in the morning, and then sell them until they're cleared out. Uncle Tetsu's approach of baking them continuously all day means that you get a still-warm cake right from the oven. And it's one of the lightest, fluffiest meringue-like cakes that you'll ever have (if you like that sort of thing).

The madelaines are fine, but nothing special. You know what you're really in line for ;)"}
{"text":"The cake is very soft and tasty. Comparing to Love Me Sweet, I like this one more and it's also $1 cheaper."}
{"text":"Came to see what the big deal was about. We arrived on a weekday around 4pm and the wait was about 45min (30min outside, 15min inside), pretty decent weather so we didn't mind the wait that much, though it's a bit stuffy indoors since they do not have AC. 

We got the cheesecake and also tried the madeleines. The cheesecake was very fluffy and eggy, and of course straight out of the oven. It wasn't my cup of tea though - I prefer sweeter desserts, and this just tasted like a very lightly sweetened cake. The madeleines (which are made with honey) just tasted like soft cupcakes.

We did not mind the wait but I don't think I'd come again unless the wait was less than 15 min. It is ridiculous that people wait more than an hour for this.

On a positive note, they just bought out the space beside the current location, probably to expand the current space. Hopefully they will make the cakes at a faster pace than the current 12 cakes per 15 min. There is no seating but one can just go into the Eaton Centre food court if they'd like to eat it right away sitting down."}
{"text":"Passed by and no line up so went to get one.

The cake is light compared to the western type cheesecake which is very heavy. 

The taste is alright. ..not too sweet. $10 for a 6 inch is on the expensive side. I don't think it is worth lining up for more than 10 mind to get one. 

Would probably go back and get one if no line up."}
{"text":"I love the taste of the matcha soft serve! I find it has a strong taste. The first time I went I was given a large portion which made me want to go back. This second time around I tried the matcha/milk mix and it was skinny and barely anything. The twists are very inconsistent here. :( I also find that the soft serve is more on the icey side and it melts incredibly fast! You do not want to eat this in 30 degree weather."}
{"text":"Delicious Japanese style cheesecake. Think light sponge cake with just a hint of cheese. I was in Japan last month and tried two other cheesecake places similar to this. Also very light and made right in front of you so it's warm. If you're looking for the heavy thick American style cheesecake, this is definitely not what you'll find here. 

Totally made my day when I saw Uncle Tetsu himself leaving for lunch and got a picture together with him on his way back in. This was during opening week when he was here in person to promote. 

Only reason I'm not giving it a full 5 stars is because I stood in line for 1 hour despite being there right at opening. I can see the line up from my apartment window. I'd say that the line is shortest during the weekday in the early-mid morning. If it rains, the line is even shorter. Avoid weekends and Friday evenings because the line can swell into a crazy two hour wait."}
{"text":"Arrived at: 2:50 pm
Left at: 3:40pm
Waited for less than an hour! Yay!

I visited Uncle Tetsu on a Wednesday afternoon and although the line wasn't too long, it almost took an hour before I got my hands on a cheesecake. We ended up getting two cheesecakes and four madeleines.

The madeleines tasted good but it wasn't anything special so I would skip on that.

I had to try the cheesecake while it was still hot and it's like nothing I've ever tried before. It's incredibly airy and there was definitely a cheese taste to it (even though it doesn't look very cheesy). I also tried it cold by putting it in the fridge overnight and it still tasted good! It hardened a bit and tasted more like a typical New York cheesecake but it wasn't as dense.

Now on to the million dollar question...is it worth lining up for it?
No...unless if you have time to kill like me!

I would suggest that you wait for the hype to die down or just go there super early in the morning if you want to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"Upon visiting Toronto, my friend who is a local said that we had to try Uncle Tetsu. When it opened, apparently there were lines out the door for hours. We stood in line for about 30 minutes. The line is mainly limited by the size (it is a tiny space inside) and their oven sizes - they can only make a certain number of cheesecakes per hour. Also, once they run out for the day (usually happens in the afternoon), they don't make more. When it isn't too cold out, standing in line isn't too bad because you can watch them make the cheesecake before your eyes through the large window. There is also a shop next door that says a variety of matcha flavored desserts, including matcha cheesecake, but the lines are usually for the original cheesecake.

The cheesecake itself ($10 for a whole cheesecake; slices not available) comes out hot from the oven, and is the lightest and fluffiest cheesecake I have ever had. There is barely any hint of cream cheese, and it isn't very sweet. I liked trying it since it is so different from American cheesecakes, but not sure it is worth waiting in line for."}
{"text":"Like, its nice to go to try it out for the sake of the hype. Rabbas actually has better cheesecake in my opinion, it tastes like light fluffy sponge cake really so if you like that its great but not worth the wait. As people said, better when chilled in the fridge."}
{"text":"Came here on 05/07/2015 to pick up some Cheesecake for Mother's Day weekend with my girlfriend. We knew about this place from the news and online, and we wanted to check it out. So we arrived at around 8:00 p.m. and of course, there was a line. Note: There is ALWAYS a line. We waited about 1.5 hours, which wasn't too bad (from what we hear), so that was a plus.

As for what we got, we bought the Cheesecake for $10, which is a pretty good price, and ended up caving in and buying four Madeleines for $8, a little pricey but we were waiting so long, we just wanted to get everything we could.

As for the taste, I didn't actually try the Madeleines, but my Mother said they were very good. A great cake-y pastry with a nice sweetness. As for the Cheesecake, I thought it was great. It was light, with a subtle cheese flavour, which was refreshing compared to the heavy American cheesecakes. I truly enjoyed it, and my whole family agreed that it was delicious.

Unfortunately have to knock one star off for the wait/supply shortage, as I will not be coming back here until the hype dies down a little. Other than that, it's definitely worth trying once, and then again for sure when there is little to no wait.

Cheers!

{"text":"I'm not an expert on cheesecake.. but omg.. this cheesecake is soooo good!!!!! Not sure if the size of the cheesecake is worth the line or not.. but ahh...its just soo good!!

The smell of this cheesecake just draws you in... *_*"}
{"text":"The original cheesecake is very delicious but over-hyped. It has a unique texture and smell which is great especially when it's warm. Seems like there are only 3 things you can order so it was fairly quick. Fortunately the line was not too long when I went as I don't think I would wait in a much longer line for this."}
{"text":"I came by to test my luck on a Thursday evening after work...no line up at Uncle Tetsu!!

I took advantage of the opportunity and purchased the angel hat cake, original cheesecake and honey madelines; I have to say that I do enjoy the original series more than the matcha.

The angel hat cake is an adorable sphere shape and is incredibly light and fluffy.. kind of like those sponge cake you get at a Chinese bakery but more moist and with a rich cheese taste.

The price is very reasonable for Uncle Tetsu.. $8.85+tax for the cakes at ~$7 for 4 madelines."}
{"text":"I'm glad there was no line when I went (a Thursday around 2 or 3), bc I was determined not to wait in a huge line up just for cheesecake. I don't even really like cheesecake! 

Super glad we beat the line, because WOW. I could eat like five of the original cheesecakes in a sitting. This has totally changed my mind on cheesecake. Delicious and light-starts mildly sweet, the middle of the bite is cheesy and right before it gets overwhelming, rounds out w a light and cleansing (??? Not sure what word to use) eggy kind of flavour. It's like eating a cloud. 

Definitely worth the wait for at least one. Should have grabbed two, since no one was behind me. Try it for SURE.

EDIT: this is a review for the location right off Dundas, but I doubt it matters."}
{"text":"One of the best things I ate in Toronto. My husband and I waited about 30 minutes in line for two cheesecakes since as far as I know there is nothing like this in Dallas, TX. We tried it fresh from the oven and the next day after storing it in the fridge. I prefer the cheesecake warm and fresh hands down. While warm, the cheesecake is so soft it practically melts in your mouth. My husband and I weren't the least bit hungry, but we ended up devouring half of one cake. After storing in the fridge, the cake became denser, similar to pound cake but tastes like cheesecake goodness. This is definitely a lot lighter and less sweeter than the American version. 

We also bought a few Madelines, which were not as good as the cheesecake. 

Tdlr: Eat the cheesecake while it's still warm. Skip the Madelines."}
{"text":"I feel like they've changed the recipe or maybe I'm just going nuts, but from the last time I had uncle testu (last year) and when I tried it again this year it tasted pretty different and much tastier! It had less of a cheesy and dense taste when I had it again this year, and was actually pleasantly delicious! Very fluffy and was not overly sweet. For $10 you can buy a whole cake, which is pretty cheap. I've had the matcha one which was delicious as well."}
{"text":"Never had Japanese cheese cake before so I had to try.  Cafe was empty when I went in.  Paid $10 for 1 cheesecake, cash only.  

It's super light and eggy.  But that's about it.  Don't know about you but I like a little more sugar and some tang.  Somebody on Yelp said you should try it warm, room temp, and cold.  So I did and I'm glad I did.  It definitely had different textures and flavors changed a bit too.  It was interesting nonetheless.  

Would I order it again?  Probably not.  Unless I ate it with some nice sweet home made whipped cream, berries, and a tuile biscuit.  Mmmmm...  

Give as a gift?  Probably because it's so darn cute.  But once they taste it, they may get let down lol. Perhaps give it as a gift with a side of sweet home made whipped cream, berries, and a tuile biscuit! Haha"}
{"text":"Long overdue, but finally gave Uncle Tetsu's a try! Their freshly baked Japanese cheesecake is like none other, with a unique light, spongy, airy texture and just the right amount of cheesiness that instantly melts in your mouth. I can see why there is always a long lineup at their store... it's so good and not overtly dense that I even snuck another slice as my breakfast!"}
{"text":"I find 10 dollars to be expensive but I do love uncle tetsu! It's a great light dessert. I would recommend that people put the cake in the fridge before eating it. The coolness allows the flavour to really set in and makes the cheesecake taste way better. Otherwise I find it too bland when you just eat the cake fresh out of the oven."}
{"text":"I know this bakery is overrated and their line ups are ridiculous but that didn't stop me from visiting. I really like their cheesecake because it's different -- light, slightly creamy, and not too sweet. However the price they charge for each one is inflated. I watched them make it, and it's literally pouring special cake batter in a pan and baking it. Maybe I only saw the end part and I may not have seen all of the ingredients, but just witnessing the process made me think \"this costs 10 dollars! What's all the hype about?\" I also think their 1 cake per customer is also unreasonable. Those people waited long and they should be able to buy the amount they want. They say it's because of their limited production that ensures they only serve cakes fresh, but I think that's a pretty skimpy excuse. Either ramp up your production or make your customers feel a bit less cheated. Anyway regardless of this rant about their stupid rules, the cake was decent. In fact, it's actually better after hours in the fridge than when it was fresh because you can taste the cheese more.  Would I go out of my way to line up for hours and go back? No. I only waited 20 minutes and that's the most I would do."}
{"text":"Had the cheesecake 4 times this month, and I finally decided to write a review, despite mixed reviews from friends. This is about the cheesecake, not the store itself and it's wait time, since mine were purchased at the Front Street Foods by Union Station.

It's light, airy, fluffy, and moist with a cream consistency and a touch of sweetness. Might have felt differently had I waited in line for 45 mins - 2 hours .... but I didn't. Definitely, nothing like the more dense Western style cheesecake, so you'll be dissapointed if you're expecting that. I like this style, too. Then again, I love Japanese pastries.

As for the madalaines, nice to try, but in my humble opinion, not worth the $3 or the wait. I got the chance to try both the orginal and green tea flavours. Check out their pop-up shop at the Front Street Foods extended until September 27th, no line-ups for the cheesecakes! They sell slices, half a cake, and whole ones!"}
{"text":"The queue is always depressingly long, but I personally think it's worth the wait!

I tried their Madeleines and cheesecake and was not disappointed! Although the queue got intense near the door (a bum was aggressive for money, and shortly after someone offered to pay me for my spot?) I would definitely do it all again. Bring a charged phone, a friend or your Nintendo 3DS, because you will definitely have time to kill. I maybe waited an hour to 45 mins for mine.

The cheesecake can last up to three days in the fridge, and keeps very well! The madelines are great snacks after dinner, and are very light and fluffy in texture.

Staff are super friendly and fun. I enjoyed talking to them when I could!"}
{"text":"The long line outside was ridiculous, especially during the winter. Frankly, it is not worth the wait. The cheesecake is good, but not if you have to stand outside during a Toronto winter. A major beef I have with this place, is that it's cash or Canadian debit card only. They do not accept credit, or US debit cards. If you are visiting, go next door to the bus station and get some cash at the ATM. 

The cake is light and eggy when fresh and hot. Almost like an angel cake in it's texture and lightness. I liked it, but the eggy nature limits how much you want to eat. We had at least half a cake left over, so we put it in the fridge. Cold, it firms up and tastes more creamy and like what you might expect from American cheese cake. I liked this more. Try it both ways and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"I waited 2 hours. I got there at 3:00 and was served by 5:00. I has never had Japanese cheesecake before but after hearing all the hype I wanted to give it a try. 

they only take cash so keep that in mind before going. 

After ordering the cheesecake and the Madelines And trying it when I got home I loved the madelines, they were great. 

The cheesecake though I was not a fan of, many people must like it but personally it wasnt for me. I would come back for thr madelines but not for the chessecake.

The price is $10 for 6inch cake and $2.50 for a madeline. Fair price and the staff is friendly for such a busy place."}
{"text":"I love their Japanese cheesecake. It is light with the perfect amount of cheese flavour, but I'm not a fan huge fan of American cheesecake! When my husband tried it he wasn't a fan because he loves dense American cheesecake. I also believe it's because he's not used to Asian desserts."}
{"text":"The latest arsenal in Uncle Tetsu's corporate empire in Canada (and soon expanding into US0fA) which spans Bay Street, Dundas, here and Markham is the cleanest of the locations, due to the newness of Union Station's hall, but also has nothing else to sell other than the traditional cheesecake.

The cheese cake itself is light, fluffy and more of a spongy cheese (Philadelphia), butter and flour simple goodness. It beats the heck out of the heavy and unhealthy New York Cheesecake any day. It is expensive, however, coming at $10 for a 10 cm offering (the size is now 7 inches).

Aside from the cleanliness, the other advantage is that this Uncle Tetsu often can sell you more than one cheese cake. There are usually no line-ups and they are happy to sell you two or three if you are that obsessed (or have noticed how small these things are). There is a sign cautioning customers that only one cheese cake per customer may be bought, but with so many cakes waiting for customers the sign is ignored. Like the first location a good portion of its customers are Chinese-Canadians who attack anything authentically Japanese, but because Union Station is a transit hub and this shop is in the GO Train terminal the shoppers here are much more varied, which is a testament to the popularity of Uncle Inc.
Incidentally, another sign pointing to Uncle's popularity is how none of the employees are Japanese anymore. The shops are all staffed by regular minimum wagers."}
{"text":"***Review is for the Café, the place next-door to the longass Cheesecake line.***

I've tried UT's cheesecake, at a party, and it was awh-ight.  Would I stand in a line to wait, only to be limited to 1 cheesecake?  Hell no!

Anyway, over the weekend, I finally got to try some Green Tea Soft serve over at that other longass line perpendicular to UT, Tsujiri!  It was pretty good, at ~$5 in a cone.  Uncle Tetsu's version is marginally cheaper which is appreciated.

Taste-wise, they're pretty much interchangeable in colour, texture, & taste, but I found the UT version much sweeter.

Soft serve was served in a cup.  And when I asked about whether or not it came in a cone, she said, yes, but they were out of cones. :(((  It's the same price, btw, so I would've definitley preferred it in an eco-friendly, edible vessel.

No line on this one, folks!"}
{"text":"This cheesecake is overrated. NY cheesecake has a richer taste and extra added calories but then again that shouldnt be you concern as you want to enjoy your dessert. Its not worth waiting in line for 2hours. Even the Madeleines. I am so not impressed. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The one question you'll ask yourself: \"Is it worth a (maximum) 2 hour wait?\" and the verdict? NO!!! Its definitely over-hyped. Not worth trying!! Do not do it. 

You can buy something SUPER similar at an asian bakery, or like T&T supermarket. Its this fluffy cake that you taste and you're kind of like \"...i think i taste a hint of cheesecakeness\" and THEN when you're done the cake, you're so unsatisfied. See, its not sweet, and its so airy its basically empty calories. As someone who loves her sweets for being sweet, it was not satisfying finishing a slice of this cake. Not sure what people mean by having \"a rich flavour\" almost no flavour man. Girl needs sweetness. 

BUT! On the other hand, their honey pastries things are quite delicious (madeleine!) its really yummy and taste like honey. But NOT worth a wait, at all. 

Dont be fooled friends."}
{"text":"Line up is kinda better now.. Kinda... 

From what I remember, there are set times when the bakery will bake the angel hat cake. I was quite surprised to see how small it was! Honestly the texture taste the same as the original cheese cake for me, maybe a bit spongy-ier. Order it if you want something .. cute :)."}
{"text":"AVOID the shaved ice.  there is zero sugar in it. it was just green tea liquid on top of some shaved ice (bitter). i asked for sugar/condensed milk or ANY sweetener.  she responded, no sorry. and said next customer!  ZERO sugar in it. beware.

customer service horrendous."}
{"text":"I went in the morning so I will not have to get in line, I order the cheesecake and the angel hat cake. I have to say I don't really understand the fuzz around it. Both of the cakes are bland, yes the texture is enjoyable but in the cheesecake you can barely taste the Japanese cheese they use and in the angel hat you holy taste the eggs. I am glad I didn't had to wait in line for that."}
{"text":"Bought a couple cheese cakes to share with my inlaws and had a chance to watch the ingredients they use to produce the cakes. If the quality of ingedients are any indication then i understand why this place was so overhyped."}
{"text":"Totally loved this place! The price for an original cheese cake is $10 and it was delicious. If you think $10 is a little pricey,  this is like the best cheese cake in Toronto so it's pretty cheap if you think about it. I admire the workers too, they're nice, sweet, and friendly. 

Their cheese cake is TOTALLY my cup of tea! I'm not a big fan of normal cheese cakes because it's always so cold and frozen. 

Their cheese cake is more of a baked sponge cake, but it's also very flavourful! When I first tried their original cheese cake it was LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT! The cakes are not too try and not too damp, no wonder this is the best cheese cake in Toronto! 

I heard from some of my friends that they had to wait in line FOREVER, but it was pretty different from me. I only waited in line for AT LEAST 5-10 minutes, and I got the FRESH made cake right away. Their cake are very home made cakes and I can tell you probably need a lot of work and skill to make these delicious cakes, so I totally appreciate the workers! The customer service is good, they smile when they're talking to you, even though they're super busy. 

But overall, EVERYTHING is amazing. My only complain is that the store is pretty small, and it's hard to leave through the super narrow one way exit. I totally agree that this is the BEST cheese cake in Toronto!"}
{"text":"After seeing this on about every Facebook update, the girlfriend finally decided to play the waiting game for this cake. She has mentioned that despite the time she went at, the line always just seemed to be just as long. The average wait according to her came to just about an hour long. 

The price was definitely beyond affordable for a whole cake. The presentation looked great. This is however not your traditional American heavy cheese cake. 

The term that is used for this cake is that it is a \"soufflé\" cheesecake. It's very airy and filled with many pockets of air similar to an aero bar. Each bite was extremely light. Te flavour was the same as an original traditional cheese cake. The girlfriend described it as if you were to bite into a cloud. 

Was an overall let down based on the hype that was portrayed by the media. Personally I prefer the heavier and more dense cheese cakes out there. If I was to wait, I'd definitely would not do it. Definitely a different experience if you've never bitten into a cloud."}
{"text":"Being from out of town, I had to try the best that Toronto had to offer. 

I walked by this place when my friend was showing me around town and she pointed it out, stating that it was new and quite popular, but the lines were ridiculously long. Boy was she right! 

I came back because I wanted to do something nice and bring dessert home for my cousins and the line didn't look too long. 

I stroll on over, get in line and BOOM 2 hours later...I finally stepped foot into the door. Geezus, it was the longest I've ever had to stand in a line...for dessert. Imagine walking around the city all day, roaming over to this part of town from the ROM....and then standing in a barely moving line for 2 hours...you can only begin to imagine my irritation. 

The store is TINY, just enough that you get a snaking line of two rows, one to enter and one to exit. As soon as  you enter the store, the delicious smell of butter and flour hit you like a wind storm. It smelled AMAZING! I also liked the fact that you could see the workers prepping the cheesecake, popping it into the oven, taking it out, and branding it. It's very cool behind the scenes kind of thing and you get to see everything that goes on. Quite a bit of transparency. 

I figured since I was there, I might as well get the madelines that smelled so sweet and buttery. 

I got my cake, my madelines, paid, and walked out with a feeling of success. I FINALLY got the cake! I FINALLY made it back! And now, I can FINALLY find the subway and take it back to my cousin's house for dinner. 

As soon as I got back to her place, we opened it up and had a photoshoot. The cake smelled great, and despite the 40 minute commute, was still warm! 

We cut into it and it was nice and soft. Now Japanese Cheesecake isn't like American cheese cake, where it's super heavy and creamy. No, this had more of a sponge cake texture. It was nice and moist, and there is no evidence of cream in it at all. 

Taking my first bite, I somewhat expected more...but I was disappointed. It just tasted like a regular ol cake. Nothing too special about it, except for the fact that it was very moist and soft, which is a quality I like in my cakes...I just....expected more from that wait. 

Needless to say, I would never wait in that line again if it was a 2 hour wait....but it is something you definitely should check out.

If this business is still around next time I come back to Canada, I'm going to check out their store next door, which serves green tea matcha madelines and ice cream. 

Try it if you must, but be prepared for how underwhelming it is. 
Also, there is a risk that you may not get a cake after waiting for a while, because they only make a certain amount each day...and there's a limit of one cake per person I believe."}
{"text":"I've always seen the notorious japanese cheesecakes at asian supermarkets before but never paid much attention to them. Not until everyone and their mother started talking about Uncle Tetsu. 

It seems like it's already established itself with a cult following and I am one of them. The first time I tried it, I had to try all three kinds of cheesecake. Original, Angel Hat cheesecake and Matcha cheesecake.

The original is by far my favorite. Simplicity at its best, it's light, airy and has just the right amount of cheesecake flavour without being overwhelming. 
The Angel Hat cheesecake reminded me of more a refined angel food cake. It was light, moist and would be perfect paired with fresh fruits. 

The Matcha cheesecake was my least favourite and was disappointing because matcha is one of my favourite flavours. The flavour was there, but the texture was not. I wish it had the same fluffiness as the other two, instead it was chalky and almost gritty. 

Other than that, this place is awesome and definitely worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"A-OK really sums it up. I went around 10 am and waited maybe 10-15 minutes for it. Both the madelines and cheesecake were a bit underwhelming to be honest. I think I would be disappointed it if i had to wait hours for it. But because i only waited 10-15 mins it was okay. Appreciate that the staff were very nice."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a cheesecake person but I really enjoy Uncle Tetsu's. Personally I prefer the lighter taste and feel of Japanese cheesecake vs the heavier, New York style one. The cake is fluffy and falls apart in your mouth upon first forkful - it's very delicate. The sugar also feels lighter and not as dense.

My mom likes to grab one (or 3) whenever she comes downtown. Although there's a reputation for long lines and wait times, she always comes during off-peak hours to purchase them - there isn't much of a line so it's in and out.

I've noticed some less-than-favourable reviews, but I would attribute that to the overwhelming hype surrounding it. Unsurprisingly, when you have high hopes for food (and in the case of Uncle Tetsu's, wait in long lines), it's easy for your expectations to fall short.

Bottom line: the cheesecake is really delicious but don't expect it to be life-changing."}
{"text":"Long wait.Rude people in line. Soup nazi experience. Just have $17.55 ready to go (1 cheesecake plus 4 madelines aka. honey cakes), some time to kill and your people watching glasses on and ready to go.  

The product is somewhere between a flan and a cheesecake with a flavour profile to match. The texture was light and fluffy. The madeleines, on the other hand, were rich but not too dense.  

With all the other bakeries, pastries shops and cafes in the area that don't require a vacation day to secure their goods, I can't see myself inviting Uncle Tetsu over for dessert again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Since this place opened, I wanted to try it out because it was close to work & I absolutely love love love cheesecake. I have never had Jap cheesecake before, so it definitely peeked my interest. 

The line outside was so long that it went up to the Grey Hound station. It was like line-ception....it was a line within in a line!!!! The line outside was long....then when you thought u were close, BAM another line inside the store. My friends and I waited 3 hours to get our cheesecake. 

They limit one cheesecake per paying customer & 4 honey madeliene. The cheesecake & madelienes took about 30 minutes to bake and each round they made 12 cheesecakes & about 22-26 madelienes. Don't let those numbers fool you, all baked goods have to be pre-approved by the chef prior to packaging, so the wait definitely took longer. 

The decor inside was very cute & the staff were extremely nice. I only purchased the cheesecake, but it had a very very eggy flavor to it with a light cheese flavor. It was fluffy and very moist, but in my opinion the cheesecake was overrated. Don't get me wrong, it was good...but not for 3 hours. The service could definitely improve & become more efficient since the line kept growing and growing."}
{"text":"Missed my train on a weekday so I thought I might as well wait for Uncle Tetsu since I've now got 50 minutes to spare. Waited in line for 20 or so minutes which was expected but as I got to the front two signs made this location feel like a cheesecake sweatshop more than a store. 1. one cheesecake per person and they only make their classic cheesecake here, none of the others that you can find at other locations. 2. \"Please do not chat with the workers (...)\" or something to that effect. It felt wrong? On top of everything, when it was my turn to pay, the cashier told me AFTER I paid that he's sorry and the next batch will be in 15 minutes. F*ck that, tell me that way before I even get to the front of the line please, we're all there to get somewhere else and are on a schedule. Then the manager comes out and gives me my refund in cash instead of refund to my credit card. All in all lots of small unpleasantries."}
{"text":"Best fluffy Japanese cheesecake I've ever had. This place is totally lives up to all the hype. These cakes go out the door quick and taste best fresh so you better wait in line if you want to snag one. The cakes are amazingly soft and rich, I can't wait for one to open up in my hometown: Vancouver!"}
{"text":"Came by and saw a long line, but it was only for the cheese cake next door. Orders were quick and fast here. I had the matcha soft serve and matcha madeleine. Great matcha flavour in the soft serve. Will come again when they have the ice machine going."}
{"text":"We got the $10 cheesecake and ate the entire thing in one sitting. 

It was soft, airy, light, and satisfied our tastebuds.

After seeing a lot of reviews warning people of long lines, we didn't have to wait at all! We did go around 830 PM though.

Staff was friendly and quick - we were in and out within 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Went here with my buddy on Sunday in the morning, around 10 45 and we waited in like for approximately 30 minutes before being able to order. The cheesecake was $10 and a honey cake was $2.50.

The cheesecake I'd describe as gooey and squishy, it was pretty good but I'd say not worth the wait. I preferred the honey cake which you can actually get without waiting in line.

The interior was pretty cool with an authentic and home like feel, very artsy and cool signs to look at once you get inside and are waiting for your food to be prepared.

Also just a heads up that they dont take credit so make sure to have cash or debit !"}
{"text":"Super light and fluffy very diff then your typical cheesecake

Love this place will
Be back again , it's expensive at 10$ but then it's different"}
{"text":"This cheesecake definitely lives up the hype.  I just really love how light and fluffy, and sponge-like this cake is. It's not the typical cheesecake! It's japanese style cheesecake. I can definitely taste the cream cheese, but it is not very rich like american cheesecake. I waited in line outside for about 40 minutes on a Saturday evening for my cake. They have a limit of one cheesecake per person, so that the line moves steadily. I also tried their green tea matcha cheesecake, which has red bean on the bottom of the cake. It is considerably smaller than their signature original flavour cheesecake, and for the same price (10 bucks). Both are very tasty. But I wish it wasn't so pricey for one cake..."}
{"text":"Ok cake at best.  Service is terrible.  I could understand if it was a new establishment but it isn't.   They had a small sign that they were closing but continued to allow people to wait in line even though a quick head count, they could of verbalized that there will be no point in waiting to a certain point.  Complete lack of service.  They need to figure out a new system.  Until then I won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife was nuts about this place, it was different but good. Didn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"2 stars for their disappointing matcha soft serve ice cream 
4 stars for matcha cheesecake with red beans 
5 stars for roasted green tea
3 stars for Madeline (tastes like cupcake)
We lined up for only 5 mins at 8pm on Friday!"}
{"text":"Waited an hour and a half for this but it really isn't too bad when you're waiting with someone. Anyway, this cake is sooooooo good I'm craving it as I write this review!  It's sooo perfectly spongey and creamy. The perfect hybrid between a sponge cake and a cheesecake! Never had anything like it. I brought half of it home for my family and it was gone the next morning lol It Smells and tastes like a dream.

Also tried their madeleines but those were mediocre and even almost too oily for my liking."}
{"text":"We had the Matcha Cheesecake with Red Beans. It was a soft and light cheesecake, it is airy like a regular cake but had some texture of cheesecake when you bite into it. Pretty unique and never had anything like it before. I enjoyed the green tea flavouring and just the overall texture, very soft and fresh when we ate it.

We also tried the Matcha Green Tea Latte which was really good, I enjoyed it and highly recommend for savvy latte / coffee drinkers. The green tea was pretty regular and tasted like any other green tea.

The line was really long for the original cheesecake, so we went to the matcha cafe part of Uncle Tetsu's since they have 2 parts of the bakery. I'd definitely come back again and would love to try the original cheesecakes."}
{"text":"Today i bought 2 matcha cakes which was ordinary cake,nothing special. and the price is overwhelmed.

{"text":"Cheese cake is too eggy. Def not worth the wait and price"}
{"text":"This cheesecake is worth the wait. We only waited 50 minutes but we were told it would be about an hour and a half by the line monitor. The cheesecake is light and fluffy. Not too sweet, just plain and simple. I love it. Can't compare it to the amazing Cheesecake Factory because the are so different.  Not at all heavy and easy to duplicate at home if you know how to merengue."}
{"text":"Amazing f*cking cheesecake. So soft in the mouth and warm. Definitely not like one I'd have back in Buffalo. Definitely was worth the 30 mins wait."}
{"text":"I waited in line for 30 minutes which compared to others is nothing. But honestly I found this food disappointing.  The so called cheese cake is more like a SpongeBob cake with a small hint of cheese flavour. And the honey cakes taste like a stale cupcake. I was not happy at all with this. So I brought it to my mom's work to try a few seemed ok with it. The rest prefer the normal cheese cake. Not worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"The cheese cake was light, fluffy, and delicious!  Very unique.  But the wait is rediculous..2 hours min even in the rain.  Cash only hommie....  n only one cheese per mouse!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake was a favorite among friends. It was light, soft and airy! Out of all the uncle tetsu baked goods the cheesecake and original cheese tarts were my favorite! The matcha cheese tart was good if you like matcha, I'm not a crazy fan of it but it was still good! Same with the chocolate flavored tart! The Madeleines were alright as well, it was pretty ordinary. If you want a baked good that isn't too sweet, I would choose the cheesecake or the madeleines. 10/10 would go again ."}
{"text":"Waited in line for 20 minutes and then realized I can also buy it from their cafe not too far away. The one I got from Angel cafe is still warm, so why not put up a sign to tell people go there. 
I got the cake and avoided wasting another 20+mins. The cake was worth trying and the price is OK. I like it. It is somewhere in between the sponge cake and the traditional cheese cake."}
{"text":"After seeing the video of the jiggly bread from Japan, I was curious if this place was the same as the hype from Japan so my friends and I decided to stop by and check it out. After being open for about a year already, I guess the hype for this place has died down because there was no line when we arrived on a Friday afternoon. We just got 1 cheesecake for $10.

Note: there are two stores that are next to each other, this one only sells the regular flavor cheesecake while next door offers the green tea/matcha flavored baked goods. Choose wisely before you go to the respective store to order your food.

Like all the other posts, this description of this Japanese style cheesecake is pretty accurate by saying that is soft, fluffy, and eggy. From the look of it, you would not imagine how soft it is until you touch it or actually eat it. But in my opinion, it is way too eggy so if you do not like the eggy taste, then avoid!

It was a good experience to try but I do not think I would get it again, especially if there is a long line for it.."}
{"text":"I really liked the matcha ice cream and their cheese cake, but I don't know about their matcha cheese cake and madellain......  for me it tasted like fart, and lack of butter for madellain. but go for cheese cake. very soft and whipped texture!"}
{"text":"Zero stars for extremely bad customer service. 

I waited in line. I was the ninth person in line. With a new batch of 12 coming out. They packaged away three of them because they are selling them at home dundas square later today. I ended up not getting one and instead being the first person in line. 

THAT IS NOT HOW YOU DO BUSINESS.  

If you have a big batch to do for a show, you don't take it away from the waiting customers. YOU DO WHAT NORMAL BAKERS DO WHICH IS WAKE UP EARLY AND BAKE THEM. 
 
The service was terrible in there."}
{"text":"I don't understand what's the fuss about uncle tetsu!? I'm not saying the quality is bad, it isn't. But, it was an ordinary cheese cake, that's all! 
Believe me they are super smart in alloting such small room to customer and limiting purchases to one per person ..this has led to long crazy line ups outside, increasing their popularity ! 
I woldn't have been a customer if it wasn't for the curiosity to see what it is all these people wait in line to buy! 
I am happy with the price and quality, but I wouldn't recommend it over other places. Very ordinary."}
{"text":"the cheesecake is definitely good (like a spongey not-overly-sweet american cheesecake). 

the value-for-money isn't too bad either. however, there's a value-for-time component that differs for each person but should be factored in. my personal rating...

1 star - if you've to wait more than 45 minutes, which is typical.
2 stars - if you have to wait 30 minutes, which is rare.
3 stars - if you have to wait 15 minutes.
4 stars - if there's no line, which has probably never happened."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to catch this place with no line the other day. The cheesecake is very good, we ate ours both warm and refrigerated the next day. Two different experiences. I prefer warm: the cake is soft, fluffy, buttery and distinctly eggy. It's like eating a cheesy cloud that melts once it hits your tongue. Refrigerated is also good. It's firmer and more akin to western style cheesecake, but less sweet and not as tart. The only thing I didn't like was that there's not enough room for seating, and I like eating this cake warm. However, I heard that they're opening yet another cafe with seating in March. I'd definitely go again, next I'll try the matcha cafe."}
{"text":"Ahhh weather is going bonkers and so are my food cravings, with that thought in mind I hopped into the lineup at Uncle Tetsu..I am going to have my share of Japenese Cheese Cake and no one is going to stop me! There are about 5 people ahead of me and I can get a good glimpse at the Japenese bakers at work.. 

Yoshi !! Yoshi!! 

I think that's Japanese am inside the store. 

\"Sorry miss only ONE Cheese cake per customer,\" said one of the All Women bakers behind the counter. (Which made me smile and give a peck right on Uncle Tetsu's fore head) Whhhat all that wait and only one cheese cake per person!! Umm ok! Actually my wait time was approximately 15 minute that's not bad for their regular line up on the weekends. I was smart I went during the weekday..

Ooo my turn! May I please have a cheese cake $8.88 and a Madalene $2.25 please?! \"Am sorry miss we just ran out of cheese cake,\" WTF! \"Am sorry???!!!!!\" It will be another 6 minutes... Umm ok...

So I got my items; total with tax was $13 and some change and left...so now the verdict...

Madalene at $2.25 Is worth every penny. It is served warm, it's buttery, it is not so sweet but just right kinda sweet, it's crispy on top and soft inside, even though it's buttery it's light you can literally pop 4 at once, that's why they also serve 4 in a box and you get 1 free if you buy three..hey that rhymes ;-) 

Cheese Cake at $8.88 is worth every penny as well. I was lucky to receive my cheese cake right out of a fresh batch! So it was warm, it was soft, it was gooooye but only in thought...there was nothing wet inside the cheese cake...it is nothing like our Western Cheese cake.. It was as if I was eating a light cloud and if I wasn't careful I would of eaten the whole cheese cake which has 80 grams of fat (over 120 per cent of your daily intake) and close to 1,200 calories.

Tip#
I don't think it would taste as good if the cheese cake was cold! So try to get one from a fresh batch!!"}
{"text":"For the food review scroll down. 
The fact that we all are willing to wait in line for 2.5 hours + for a spongy cheese cake is hilarious. I'm lucky I didn't have to wait this long because my friend, who thinks that patience is a virtue, realized he didn't bring enough cash after seeing this cash only sign. oops. so he called me. So after hearing what he said, that he didn't have enough cash made me think of those 'cant find my wallet cant pay for my groceries everybody is staring at me' embarrassing moments. So, as a nice and decent person, I decided to get there ASAP only wearing a hoodie. Well it's 9 degrees its sunny but damn the toronto wind has to make you shiver. Anyways after i got there I realized it's not an emergency situation at all and lined up with my friend for another 1.5 hours till we finally we got the cake and madeleines. hurray i swear this making you wait a line for 2 hours is a carefully planned strategy cuz after you waited for 2 hours you just wanna buy everything in the shop to make the wait 'worth it'. OH and i forgot to mention if you're waiting in the long queue be prepared to have your picture taken and posted on peoples snapchat story LOL during my 1.5 hour wait i spotted at least 5 people taking pictures of the queue ^_^ soo if you like being the spotlight come buy a cheesecake!  

tldr; madeleines tastes heavenly and the cheese cake actually tastes like any of the japanese cheesecake you can get in hong kongs citysuper which is like uhh metro or sobeys in here so it wasnt a surprise for me! but the madeleines tastes really good when its warm! 

ps the guy who's making the cake batter is cute"}
{"text":"It's hard to review Uncle Tetsu because I do enjoy eating their original cheesecake very much. However the experience is always tainted by long lineups, and I do feel that it is quite pricey for what it is.

The cheesecake itself taste like a sweet sponge cake with light cream cheese flavor. It is not heavy at all and I myself can chow down a whole cake with ease and still eat a decent sized meal afterwards. It's also a crowd pleaser and you'll be the popular guy if you bring it to a party to share. And I also have to say that the carrying bag is very cute!

Overall, I would say get Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake if you want a treat and you happen to notice there is no or little line outside."}
{"text":"Came to try this infamous cheesecake! Loved it! The cake light and not too sweet. Like that you can keep for a few days. When my sisters and I arrived, there was a tiny line up and we were all impressive they open the matcha next door. 

Glad I tried this cheesecake! Definitely will go the next time."}
{"text":"First off bring a magazine, or maybe a video to watch on your cellphone or even bring a friend along (if they'll come) coz on average you'll probably be waiting in line for half an hour. If you got time and really want cheesecake from here than waiting in line isn't a problem; however, it would be very uncomfortable to wait in the heat of summer plus the heat from the small bakery. 

My next con about the wait line is that, naturally they would like you to wait as close to the shop as possible in order to not obstruct the way for other pedestrians. Unfortunately there is a nice ledge for pigeons to sit on and \"do their thing\". A friend who was waiting with me had is cellphone splatted thanks to our feathery friends (i told him to look on the bright side:it they didn't splat his ice cream lol).

After tasking the cheesecake the first thing that came to my mind was how soft it was. Kind of felt like a spongecake. The next thing was the mild taste present and that I find is pleasanyt, A lot of time when I eat cheesecake the sweetness is overpowering but not in this case.

For me, it is not a \"you have to try this when you are in toronto\" kinda deal. A lot of friends hyped it up but I found it just...normal. Waiting in line for this is like waiting in line for the leviathian in wonderland:  1/2 hour (or more)in line:2mins to finish (with a group of 3). 

Would I go back/recommend: I will be going back to get one for a friend but after that I don't think I'd be going there for a while. As for recommending it...well if you got time and haven't tried it before then sure go ahead."}
{"text":"My bf and I lined up for half an hour for cheesecake on Christmas eve. The line is still pretty slow moving and they limit you to one cheesecake per person (not sure if that is always the case, or it was the case for us because it was Xmas eve - who knows). Anyway, it was my bf's first taste of cotton cheesecake, so I made him try a piece while it was still warm, and then again after it had been in the fridge for several hours. When I asked which he preferred, he could not decide. Sigh. 

P.S. There is never a line at the matcha cheesecake shop next door. I have yet to try their products, so I can't comment."}
{"text":"The cheesecake is good, but not blow your mind AMAZING. I waited15 mins in line so I don't mind, but I wouldn't wait much more than that. It is a unique taste and texture, worth trying."}
{"text":"Torontonians seem to be predisposed to intoxicating bouts of curiosity when we happen upon a massive line-up (it must be something in the water...). \"What could possibly be worth lining up for THAT long? That line seems to barely be moving and yet they diligently continue to wait! I must cancel all of my plans and queue up immediately (and then proceed to brag about how ridiculously long I waited for whatever the \"it thing\" happens to be that day)!\" I believe the kids call it FOMO, and I was FOMOing hard this past Saturday. I needed to try that cake that everyone can't seem to shut up about! The long and short of it? We need to stop freaking out about good ol' Uncle Tetsu. IT'S JUST CAKE, PEOPLE! Relax!

2 hours. There are an endless amount of wonderful activities that a person can accomplish in 2 hours. I chose to wait for a cake with some mischievously mirthful dude's face branded onto it.  That's 2 hours that I will never get back and I will have to live with that misguided decision for the rest of my days.  I probably could have solved world hunger during that sizeable chunk of time if I really put my mind to it, but alas, the temptation of the mystery cake proved too alluring. Sorry, world - but once I entered that line at Tetsu's, there was no turning back.  If you are reading this while you are currently in line, I urge you to just walk away. I don't know you, but I can guarantee that you have more worthwhile things to do.

I want you to think of a sponge cake. Now, think of what that would taste like if it had cream cheese in the batter. That's all that this is. Nothing more. It's a bland, spongy, cheesy mass of disappointment. There is no magic. Contrary to all of your hopes and dreams, your taste buds will not euphorically rejoice the moment Tetsu passes through your lips. Anyone who claims otherwise is only trying to justify the ludicrous amount of time that they have wasted. 

Reality check and regret aside, I believe if you treat this cake as a canvas for more flavourful toppings, it has the potential not to completely suck.  Wait until the hype has died down, grab yourself one of these coveted cakes, and liberally apply the sauce/topping/whatever-floats-your-boat of your choice. Until then? Release yourself from that crippling fear, you're not missing out on anything."}
{"text":"I would have given it a 4 if the line wasn't insanely long. We were pretty much at the door at 9am  but it still took us about 30 minutes. One cheesecake per person and it smelled heavenly!!!!

Cheesecake is $10 and I wish I could've had a slice while it was hot! I had a slice chilled and it was alright, nothing super special. Very light and you could probably eat the entire cake by yourself. 

The madeleines were yummy! Buy 3 and get 1 free. Eat them all by yourself. Definitely got to buy that if you're already there. Nice little brekky treat. 

Overall a pretty good japanese treat but I can't say it was out of this world nor would I wait in line 2 hours plus for it. However one day I will get to try the cheesecake hot!"}
{"text":"Great cheesecake. Light and fluffy. 

If you know when to go, you can score a pretty relatively short wait. If the line is past the second pillar of the Toronto coach terminal don't bother unless you have all the time in the world. 

Important to note that it's cash only, 1 cake per person. $10 a cake taxes in: bing bang boom. 

The madeleines are nothing to write home about but of its your first time in, you'll want to get a box just to make the long wait feel worth it."}
{"text":"I got excited by the new Uncle Tetsu Matcha Cafe since I love Matcha and like the original Uncle Tetsu cheesecakes. I was quite disappointed to say the least. We were in a rush so I had picked up a Matcha Madeleine. The light Matcha flavor was quite nice, but the cakes themselves were very dry. I was not impressed at all. It felt like it was something that would be sold at a grocery store like T&T. I would not recommend coming to this place. It is better to wait in line for the original Uncle Tetsu next door than to come to Uncle Testu's Matcha Cafe for your Japanese style cheesecake cravings."}
{"text":"If you haven't had Uncle Tetsu before, the important question to ask before you line up for hours is... Have you had Japanese cheesecake before?  

To the people who have complained its not like New York Cheesecake, I had to SMH and will try to explain....

If you saw a lineup for concert tickets for a band you never heard of, would you line up for hours to get tickets just because there were hundreds of people lined up, so the band MUST be good?  

No?  Well, that is how crazy you must be to line up for something you have never tried just because there are tons of other people waiting patiently to buy a Japanese cheesecake.  (most of whom know exactly what they are getting because they have had it in different Asian countries, not just in Japan but Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, etc, etc)

Japanese cheesecake is nothing like New York Cheesecake, that is what Carol's and Cheesecake Factory is for.  Heck, if you want that kind, go to Loblaws and buy a frozen one, it's cheap and only a short line up at the cash.

Japanese cheesecake is more like spongecake... light, not too sweet, and the selling point of Uncle Tetsu is they are made fresh as you wait, and wait, and wait.  

If you like sweet desserts, Uncle Tetsu is not for you, like most Asian desserts, there is a lot less sugar, and more attention paid to quality of ingredients, method, texture, etc.

For those who are curious, just go to T&T in the refrigerated area of the bakery section they sell packaged slices of Japanese Cheesecake for a few bucks.  Or go to Bakery Nakamura in Markham or Mon K Patisserie in East York for fresher and higher quality versions by the slice.

If you like it, then it *might* be worth it for you to stand in line for a fresh made Uncle Tetsu cheesecake - with his face branded on the top!

If you find it bland, not sweet enough, and boring, then you don't need to stand in line for hours.

Your welcome."}
{"text":"Cheesecake was good, but the lineup is horrible. I like their style of cheesecake, but if they can open pop-up shop at Union, they can surely sell cheesecakes without the lineups?"}
{"text":"By the length of the line outside, you would expect the cheesecake to be amazing. Its not bad, but its pretty small and doesn't really taste like cheesecake. I don't see what the hype is about."}
{"text":"Despite having to line up, the cheese cake was amazing! I enjoyed the regular much more than the matcha. It was light, fluffy and delicious. I recommend trying it at least once."}
{"text":"I've walked past this place many times, usually with a big smirk on my face. This is because I am hysterically laughing on the inside, and feeling half sorry for all the poor suckers lining up in all sorts of weather for this unicorn of a dessert. 

Fast forward a few weeks, and I am now stuck in this line. Luckily for me and my fiancee, the line was extremely short this day, and we waited for about 10 minutes - not bad. Within minutes, this line grew 3 fold... and again, the laughing started ha ha! There's a limit of one (1) cake per person, so we grabbed two in total.

Once we got home, we each grabbed a fork and dug in. Japanese cheesecake is extremely light with delicate flavours, which was a very nice change up to the traditional cheesecake we are familiar with. It's not too sweet, and incredibly moist.

In comparison to \"Pablo\", another famous Japanese Cheesecake in Tokyo, I would say that this place does it slightly better.

As an update, we've also tried the matcha cheesecake, and the Madeleine's. They were good too, and a huge plus was these were available next door at the cafe, without the massive line-ups.

Will I ever wait longer than 15 minutes? NO! But if its shorter, we will probably drop by again."}
{"text":"A bit of a funny story of how I got Uncle Tetsu for free and 0 minute wait. 
I was eating breakfast at Eggsmart Diner across the street at 7 AM on a Saturday morning and saw a guy with a bunch of Uncle Tetsu cheesecakes. 

Having never had the cheesecakes before, I struck up a conversation with him and to find out that he is the Managing Director of Uncle Tetsu Malaysia, here in Toronto to scout out the new store.

He offered me the cake and needless to say, I accepted. 

Now, onto the actual cake itself, and I must say it was a little anti-climatic. The texture was really soft, fluffy and with just enough warmth, but it wasn't amazing. Having grown up in Asia, I was already used to this kind of cheesecake, and it didn't feel like anything new. With novelty out of the question, the taste only elicited a nonchalant nod. 

Moral of the story- Despite not having to wait or pay for the cheesecake, I would still say that it was \"alright\". Is it worth waiting 1 hour? Other than bragging rights, probably not."}
{"text":"Pros:
1) Good price for a good piece of cheesecake. the logo on the cake is pure marketing genius.
2) Texture is fluffy with mild cheesy favours.. just how a JAPANESE cheesecake should be so back off NEW YORK cheesecake lovers who complain there isn't enough cheese flavour. Japanese cheesecake is more like a giant souffle.

Cons:
1) Too much hype and the wait is too long for a friggin' cheesecake... thank god I have caring sharing friends."}
{"text":"It's just cheesy flavored sponge cake... nothing that special. It's tasty but their business model forcing long line-ups (which I understand to create a false sense of hype) is dishonest. I'd rather them just make better tasting cheesecake and make more of them. If you like angel-food cake, this is the place for you. Bring an umbrella and a snack to eat while you wait in line."}
{"text":"I just noticed the new Uncle Tetsu location has opened inside York Concourse when I was on my way to GO customer service.  It is on your right side if you are facing the customer service counter, and on the opposite end of Booster Juice.

According to their website, their store hours are from:

Monday - Friday 8am - 9pm 
Saturday and Sunday 10am - 8pm

Luckily, there was no line up so I was able to buy a cheesecake within 2 seconds.  They had samples so I tried one (it was cold) with a toothpick.  There were two toothpick boxes, so i was looking to see where to dispose my toothpick.  Unless I read it wrong, but both boxes said \"clean\" on it.

Cash only -- I usually don't carry cash, but this time I had or else I wouldn't be able to buy one."}
{"text":"So here's the deal: my girlfriend has been talking about trying this place for a while so we finally decided to give it a try this weekend.  We waited for about an hour in line and then had our cheesecake for dessert later that night.  This isn't cheesecake like we're used to having in North America, it's closer to pound cake.  For some people they might think it's incredible, but in all reality it's a very average cake.  It's certainly not worth waiting an hour in line for.  If you're a cheesecake junkie like myself save yourself an hour of your day and go to literally any place in Toronto that sells cheesecake and you will enjoy it a whole late more than Uncle Tetsu's.  
If you're dying to go there still to check out what all the hype's about they have a bake shop that sells cheese tarts next door with no line and they are very very good with several flavors unlike the cheesecake which only comes in one flavor, plain."}
{"text":"I always love Japanese desserts for they are always leas sweet and light . When I was outside the store, I can smell the fresh cake aroma. 

Since it is soft opening, they offer some samplings. 

Japanese Cheese cake - light and fluffy, not too sweet.

Maple cookie - crunchy and made with maple sugar. 

Some sort of toasted bread that made with honey. I am sure but it is crunchy and yummy. 

I got a cheese cake to share with my family. Definitely will come back to try other items."}
{"text":"Didn't wait in line. Wouldn't give less stars if I had. This is based on the flavour of the cake.
The cake was the texture of some other dessert I had as a kid, but can't remember the name.
It tasted like plastic. Not delicious. 
Might get a matcha one when the ordering system goes live next month, just to see...

Really cannot stand that people give this place poor ratings when they CHOSE to stand in the line. Come on folks! You know about the hype, you've read about the lines and then you complain about them when it's your choice. Nobody forced you to wait around for cheesecake. Do some research and math. X amount of ovens with X amount of space can only make so many cakes in X amount of time. Grow up and quit complaining about first world problems, you lazy SOBs!"}
{"text":"Monday 9 pm, we ended up waiting 1 hour:)
Loved the taste and texture, honey madelines were really good too.
Please remember the cheese cake taste much better if you keep it in a fridge for an hour, I wish someone told me that. I ate a slice right after I bought and didn't like it at all, but leaving cake overnight in the fridge changed my mind completely. BUT, certainly not worth the wait 1, 2 or 3 hours:) I can wait for no line up day, I am sure this will happen one day:) 
I feel so sorry for the workers, it's too hot inside, may be that's why the service is slow..."}
{"text":"Don't let the long lines scare you. For under $10.00 you get a great tasting cheese cake that was freshly made. A cheese cake that doesn't sit in your belly like a brick. The wait times are not as bad as they were and you definitely get great value for your money. If you are craving a new desert experience, this is a must try desert experience!"}
{"text":"Good alternative for cheesecake lovers as opposed to the usual heavy New York cheesecakes. I guess the hype is because they bake it fresh, it's not too pricey for what it's worth, and people don't really know where to get Japanese cheesecakes... although fact is, you can get it at a lot of other places in TO (ie. Nakamura Bakery, T&T- though it's not 'authentic', Le Cafe Michi, just to name a few). 

Back to the cake, it's light and fluffy, almost like eating a sponge cake, but melts in your mouth. It's also very aromatic. The cheese flavour is subtle and soft, and nicely prepared like it's from your grandma's oven. The cake comes wrapped in a piece of thin cloth so the heat from the cake won't get the box all wet - pretty thoughtful. You also get a cute little paper bag to take it home in.

Also had their madeleines but you're better off just getting the cheesecake. And since you're there, you might want to give their shop next door a try too - their Matcha Cafe for green tea lovers. Unless you live in the area, you might not be a regular customer here especially for the wait in line. Though it might be a nice treat to have when days get chilly."}
{"text":"One of the freshest and lightest cheesecakes one can have right out of the oven. The only drawback....be prepared to wait in line for up to an hour."}
{"text":"Never had Japanese cheesecake before so I can't compare this to anything but one thing is for sure, it is so good! My friend went downtown one day and bought me one and that's how I was able to try the oh so famous uncle tetsu cheesecake. Although it doesn't really taste like your typical cheesecake.. But then again it is called Japanese cheesecake so maybe it isn't supposed to be like the cheesecake I'm used to which in a way is good because I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake unless it's a blueberry cheesecake. :) 
Overall I give this a two thumbs up! Guess I gotta make a trip downtown for some more cheesecake goodness."}
{"text":"Tried the green tea red bean cheesecake today.  It's wet rather than moist!  Even after I put it in fridge for few hours it's still wet - like a dry sponge cake soaked in water texture :(  may be this is what you get in exchange with no line up? 

I was literally in and out, no line up, boxes of cheesecake are piled up beside the cashier.  Not sure how long were they there for and how come its soaked. 

Taste is not bad, managed to keep their cheesecake flavour with a distinct green tea flavour on top. Red beans are in good shape and sweet, I can have more of them in the cake. 

Had a original cheesecake months before, it's a different texture, wonder if the green tea created the difference or they are just not standardized."}
{"text":"waited on line for 1.5 hours for 1 cake as they do not allow you to buy 2.  The cheesecake was good-its very different from a NY cheesecake-very light and fluffy and less calories but all in all-Juniors cheesecake is still the best-but this cheesecake is good but I really wouldn't classify it as a real cheesecake-its a good alternative if you want something lighter and lower in calories."}
{"text":"Heard the crazy line up so when I came back to Toronto wanted to check this out. I grew up on the fake chinese version of this and had this once in Japan where I also fell out of my chair on how good it was. Was curious how this fell on the spectrum.

I would say if fake chinese is a 4 and the one in Japan is a 10, this is a solid 7.5. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty good. Maybe I'm biased cuz I didn't eat it in Japan. I felt that the one in Japan was even more creamy and fluffy - though it could just be my memory.

Great cheesecake nonetheless. I've tried  both Matcha (no red bean) and original. Tbh, I think they are both really good and no idea why no one lines up for the matcha. It is a bit smaller but the matcha taste is awesome.

My fiance loves getting the matcha ice cream too. that's a real winner."}
{"text":"Waited 2 hours in line but it was all worth it, trust me. 
The cheesecake is super fluffy and light but has a very nice flavor. Not your average cheesecake that is rich and heavy. This was like a cloud :')

Now I know why everyone is so hyped out about Uncle Tetsu's! Must try if you're in the area, but try coming earlier in the mornings when the lines are much shorter!

For the matcha cafe,

Love the mandeleins! 
Was lining up for the cheesecake next door but noticed that there wasn't a line up for the matcha café so I went inside and bought a matcha soft serve and a box of matcha mandeleins!

The soft serve was good but not super amazingly delicious. The matcha flavour was really rich but the consistency was too watery and not creamy enough.
The mandeleins however were DA BOMB. They were super moist and rich with flavor and I DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT! 
I personally like the matcha mandeleins more than the original honey ones just because I love anything matcha, but they're both delicious~

A must try if you're in the area!
Love love love!"}
{"text":"Luckily didn't have to line up long since it was a Sunday morning, just after they opened. Cake was moist, and dense. Similar consistency to a sponge cake. I personally wouldn't line up more than 20 minutes for this. I'd be interested in trying the other times though."}
{"text":"Fluffy and cheesy. Tastes like a cheese cake + castella mix.
Unfortunately, long lines and pretty pricey."}
{"text":"The lineup is so long, but it's well worth it! I actually don't usually even like cheesecake, but Uncle Tetsu's is so light and fluffy, and not too sweet. Smelling the delicious cake while you wait an hour in line, is the most delicious torture you can endure! Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Four stars, mainly because a colleague brought one to the office to share, so I didn't have to wait in line. 

Left to my own devices, I'd have to deduct two stars for the wait, because if it doesn't involve world series tickets or precious metals, there's very little in life worth queuing for. 

I'd also probably deduct half a star for the cheesecake itself, which really wouldn't be fair. 

I come from a different cheesecake tradition, having grown up on the dense, creamy, fruit-goo-slathered New York version (short crust, please, no f*ing graham crackers!) and airy, tart homemade concoctions (almost more pie than cake) that surface during random Jewish holidays I never remember. These cheesecakes emerge from great-grandmothers' kitchens at random intervals throughout the year, and are always welcome. 

Uncle Tetsu ain't your great grandmother. 

His cheesecake is crustless, which saves a few carbs (and if you're offering pesky graham crumbs, not a bit of heartache), but loses a fun textural element. 

The cheesecake itself is extraordinarily light, it's texture consistent with every bite. It's almost more mousse than cake; you feel the bubbles, which dissolve into vanilla-custardy goodness. Between the air and eggs, it's a bit less sharp than it's New York cousins. It disappears quickly. Seconds are mandatory. 

Apparently they're also for sale outside Union Station, where the lines are smaller, though you have to pay an extra $4 for the privilege. 

Uncle Tetsu offers something different; I don't know that I'd line up for another bite, but if you bring one to my office I'd happily share."}
{"text":"I went in at 3:30pm on a Monday! Amazingly, NO LINE! I really wanted to try Angel Head but it was sold out! My favourite is the Matcha Cheesecake. It is fluffy and delicious. The consistency is always the same and my friends always buy it for our birthday celebrations. I love everything about Uncle Tetsu and I only wish they will open more stores so there will be less line ups."}
{"text":"When I eat cheesecake I'm not satisfied til it sits in my stomach like a stone, filling me equally with milk products and regret, displacing any physical forward momentum - this airy fairy thing feels like some sort spray-can-esque instant cake"}
{"text":"Green tea craze is everywhere. From drinks, to biscuits, cakes, etc. This is the latest from Uncle Tetsu well-known for his cheesecakes. 
The green tea red bean Madeline's were nice eaten hot and the nice red bean as filling gives a sweet surprise to the taste buds.
Eating the green tea cheesecake, I still find the original one better. It was definitely a shorter wait or maybe I was just right on time when they had some baked. It was a little under cooked and with the green tea and red bean mix, it has somehow lost the cheesecake flavours to the palate. Still, worth a try!"}
{"text":"The cake is good, and actually very good. It's $8.88 good, and for good value for the price and size. There is a distinct cream cheesey texture to it which changes depending on whether you have it fresh (hot) or cold. (Note: There are good Japanese cheesecake recipes online if you want to give it a try...we found very similar/reproducible texture and tastes, if you're into baking that is.) 

However, it is definitely not 1+ hour wait good, especially not in the heat, rain, and eventually snow. (Luckily, we stopped by during the soft opening and never had to wait...can you imagine no line?).  I would argue that it's better to NOT have the cake until the hype is over (if it ever ends) or they find a way to increase their yield, as you'll likely be met disappointment from high expectations and realization of wasted time. So until the quality of the food (which is amazing) can justify the stress it places on the  customers (which is horrible), 2/5."}
{"text":"Don't expect western cheesecake! This is Japanese cheesecake, which is baked to be light, fluffy, subtle flavoured, and minimally sweet like many Asian cakes (we don't go nuts on sugar). I had to try it given there has been half block lineups for months at this place, and I wandered out at 7am today and accidentally discovered they were just opening as I was walking by and there were only 5 people in line. 10 mins later I was walking out with my cheesecake, still warm from the oven.

When warm, it has a soufflé like texture and taste, more eggy and slightly cream cheesy.
A few hours later in my fridge, it had firmed up more to a fluffier, cottony version of New York cheesecake and the egginess was no longer prominent with a mild but more cream cheese dominant flavour.  

It was delicious! I don't like really heavy, fatty, cloyingly sweet desserts (and those types of desserts are super unhealthy anyways...). This cheesecake was perfect, and would be even more so with a fruit compote drizzled over. Now I'm trying to figure out if I can get one to take home with me on the plane.... :)"}
{"text":"The cake is really soft and not that sweet compared with other cakes, which is I like. But I don't think it's worthy to wait mote than 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Stopped by Uncle Tetsu's during my visit to Toronto from NYC back in March 2017. This food stop was the most memorable by far. I still can't get over the creamy cheesy taste and how moist the cheesecake was. I've been craving it every so often because I have not yet found a replacement in New York City. NY Chinatown has opened up \"Keki\". Similar concept but just not the same.
I like to eat it when it first comes out but I was so amazed that the cheesecake still taste SO GOOD after a day or two in the fridge. I also tried the Angel hat cake but the cheesecake is the winner. 
I recommend anyone to wait in line for the cheesecake ($10) if you make a trip to Toronto. It will make your trip a whole lot complete."}
{"text":"I guess the matcha cheesecake will be good (but I won't go and line for it, never! i'll wait for the hype to go down and if it never does, well... too bad...). The matcha ice cream is really good, but give me a break: 4.75 after HST for that small sized cup (well, the cup size is Ok, but not even filled 1/4th!)."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this and I had previously had it in Japan. If you think paying $4 for a small cheese tart is worth it then go for it.  Way overpriced for what it is and don't be fooled by the lines.  It's nothing special.   So 3.5 for the quality and 1 for the value."}
{"text":"My husband and I waited for a total of 2 hours on the second day of opening. The lady who was explaining the wait time to us (probably the manager), said that this cheesecake shop is double the size of the shops in Asia. They can only bake 12 cakes at a time @ 45 minutes, and they don't always come out perfect. The imperfect ones are not sold to customers, so they definitely have a good high standard. For a fact, we witnessed them withholding two batches of imperfect Madeleines, and we waited an extra 20 minutes before we got our cheesecake and Madeleines.

We were so excited to try it once we got home, it was still so warm! It tasted amazing like a cheesecake soufflé, airy and light. You get a build up of cream cheese goodness, but definitely not overly sweet like your traditional cheesecake. A person can easily indulge and devour an entire 6\" cake by themselves while fresh!

As for the Madeleine's, they were good and you can taste the butter and honey. Personally, I prefer the traditional French style version of it.

The cake is definitely worth the wait if you love the idea of cheesecake + soufflé, all in one!"}
{"text":"Was downtown at Union station a while back when they had a small food market and saw that Uncle Tetsu's had a stand.  A combination of hearing a lot about this place paired with my loving anything with cheese in it quickly convinced me to line up and give it a go.

The cheesecake was unlike anything I have ever had before, certainly not run of the mill.  It was almost as if a normal cheesecake went against its family's wishes and bred with a sponge cake.  The cake was soft and moist, not overly crumbly and wasn't overly sweet!

I would definitely go again, however I'm not eager to brave the long lineups!"}
{"text":"i normally dont like cheesecake,  but their cheesecake taste more like something between cheesecake and spongecake, which is very nice.  everytime i go there,  there s a big line-up, but the staffs are always friendly and patient!"}
{"text":"So if you haven't had a chance to try uncle tetsu's cheesecake yet maybe i can help you simulate what it is like. 

Imagine a New York Cheesecake. Now, imagine a sponge cake. OK, now let your imagination run wild as the cheesecake and sponge cake make sweet sweet love with each other. You my friend, have a kinky mind.
Fast forward 9 months, and you have an Uncle Tetsu's japanese cheesecake.

Another thing that might work is taking a small bite of new york cheesecake and a small bite of sponge cake and eat them both simultaneously.

My verdict?
Well, is it good? Yes, it's pretty good, BUT y'all need to calm yourselves down. This is not good enough to be worth a 2 hour wait, so I'm pretty glad that a friend was kind enough to go out of her way to buy it for me because i was not planning to go until i heard that the line ups were no longer that long. I think for myself, personally, I would only be willing to wait 30 minutes for this.

Toronto is full of bandwagonners though, so I understand why everyone has fallen for the hype."}
{"text":"It's more a cake, not a cheese cake. Was super hyped going in and only waited 30 mins, but it didn't deliver. Yes it is light and airy and has a unique texture. But I don't really eat for texture I eat for taste. It is different from normal cheesecake but given the choice I would rather get a slice of pistacio cheesecake over a whole japanese cheesecake. 

This cheesecake seems like a diet cheesecake: less dairy, less sugar, less flavour"}
{"text":"I've had the regular uncle tetsu cheesecake before, but I really wanted to try the matcha one. I love the cheesecake here because its texture is light and fluffy. There is still a strong cheese flavour without it being too heavy. I also like that they include a cheesecloth. I wonder if that is to hold the cake together because they're often used to keep cheese curds from falling apart.

The matcha cheesecake can be purchased as the original matcha or you can have red bean added to it for the same price. I got the regular because I personally don't like red bean. The texture remains consistent for an uncle tetsu cheesecake - light and fluffy and cheesy - but the matcha flavour disappointed. It did not come through strongly at all, so it was almost like having the regular cheesecake, except that it's green. I hoped maybe the soft serve would provide the matcha flavour; unfortunately, that fell short as well. The soft serve tasted like artificial green tea powder rather than the strong matcha flavour that I was expecting.

Overall, if the line is too long on the original side, I would definitely go to the matcha store to grab a cake since it is still delicious, but I had to take stars away because the matcha was a true let down. If you're looking for an authentic matcha taste, you won't find it here :("}
{"text":"Waited till the hype died down, still had to wait 30 mins in the cold as it is a small place.
You can smell the fresh bakery a block away. 

Bought the original Japanese cheesecake and their Madeleine.

Cheesecake:
If you don't like your cheesecake too sweet than you should try it.
texture is really different.

Madeleine:
Tasted good 
Very buttery

The boxes they come in are very cute."}
{"text":"The cheesecake was spongy and soft, however it was not worth the 45 minute wait outside. Maybe wait until it is less crowded before you attempt to buy one of these cheesy-delights."}
{"text":"I got two cheesecakes but had to line up twice (One cheesecake per person). I went on a Friday around 7 PM and found little to no line up. Line moves pretty quickly. The store literally felt like a sauna!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try this place since Japan. I walked past the line one day and it was really crowded on the weekend. So I decieded to go on a Tuesday morning at 9am and their was no line. I was really excited to try this  cheesecake because I love cheesecake. I like the look of the shop and that it only cost 10 dollars for a cheesecake. The problem is the cheesecake tasted like a light sponge cake. I like the whole foods cheesecake for $20 a lot better than this cheesecake. This might be because of preference but I did not love the cheesecake. I just thought it was ok."}
{"text":"It seems like the ultimate question on everyone's mind is \"is Uncle Tetsu's Cheesecake worth the wait?\"

I hope that this review will help you answer that question.

As we all know, the wait can get a little bit crazy. I personally waited for about an hour. Upon finally getting the cake, which came out to about $10, I ran back to my hotel like a little schoolgirl.

However, I wasn't completely blown away as I expected to be. It tasted like an airy, soft sweet potato cake more than anything. At the same time, I have to give Uncle Tetsu credit for his interesting take on cheesecake.  

Upon chilling it, you will find it to have a more traditional cheesecake-like taste and texture while still maintaining that very lightness. I personally like it better chilled.

So the verdict? I think it's worth the wait. Who knows? Maybe it's the wait and limited availability that make this cheesecake taste that much better..."}
{"text":"This 'cheesecake' is bland and over-rated. I will not be returning to Uncle Tetsu's."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Angel Cake cheesecake however it is not a traditional cheesecake at all! I liked the lightness and creaminess of this cake but it's not like any cheesecake I've ever had before, to be honest it doesn't even taste like cheesecake. It's a dessert of its own. I would recommend coming here to try something new as I have never had anything that tasted like this in North America or Europe. I came around 3:30pm on a Wednesday and there was no line up. I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to try something unique however wouldn't recommend to someone looking for a traditional cheesecake. No seats inside either so it's only takeaway."}
{"text":"Thank goodness they had a pop-up shop at Union Station during the summer and early fall where there was no line!  My coworkers and I got one 3 weeks in a row while we could! It is a good value for a full cheese cake compared to other dessert places. I normally do not eat cheese cake since I don't like it, but Uncle Tetsu just tastes different!"}
{"text":"Really delicious but long lines. Also the store inside gets really heated, I feel bad for the workers."}
{"text":"Came here the second time today and the line up isn't as crazy(10 mins wait) as the first time I tried this place out (about an hour almost wait). I got the original cheesecake the first time and it was honestly so light and fluffy when it's kept at room temperature, but dense and heavy(just as good) after being kept in the fridge. This time around I got the original cheesecake (my new favourite), matcha cheesecake, matcha madelines, and the honey madelines. I must say that I LOVED all of them, the madelines in contrary to some reviews are surprisingly moist. I personally prefer the matcha madelines over the honey madelines. In terms of the cheesecakes, I prefer the original cheesecake rather than the matcha flavoured cheesecake. All in all, if I could beat the rush, $10 for a cheesecake is more than worth it."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this location a few days ago. As soon as I walked in the doors it smelled so good and both times I've gone by (4pm and 5pm) there's been a long line. It took about 20 minutes to get to the cash but it was worth the wait! Also, they now have a debit/credit machine!

The cheesecake is so light and fluffy. It's the perfect amount of sweetness, unlike most cheesecakes that are heavy and leave you feeling sick after. 

It was my first time trying Uncle Tetsu's and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool cheesecake. Definitely not traditional NY style or anything but still a great treat in its own right."}
{"text":"I've been to the original location in Fukuoka, Japan, and this place is exactly the same. The cheesecake texture reminds me of an angel cake in many ways, but tastes different. Definitely recommend Uncle Tetsu to anyone looking for Japanese style cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Not worth the wait. It was tasty for novelty' sake but not worth the long wait. Would return when lines go away but definitely not worth the wait to line up again."}
{"text":"This is a really yummy place to get cream cheese cake. Lineup on a tuesday evening was 15 minutes wait which I really don't mind for such a nice dessert for dinner."}
{"text":"Tempted by the hype, I found myself lucky one Tuesday evening when my boyfriend brought some home after work.

The texture is the best part of this dessert. Supper fluffy, light, airy, but creamy without being heavy. Like a pillow you can eat :)

The taste - meh. It did taste really good, but reallllyyyy mild. So for a mild super light tasting dessert I would say it's great, but I found myself wanting more flavour out of it. I enjoy less sweet desserts (which this definitely is) but I still like my food to have some taste.

This was one of those things where it isn't worth the calories. For almost no taste, not worth the extra pounds imo.

I'd rather dive into an XL slice of rich, cheesy, oozing-with-cherry-sauce original cheesecake for double the calories than a slice of tasteless calories, even with the lovely pillow texture :)"}
{"text":"Japanese cheesecake, if you know it, you'll like it. Don't like the lineup? Just go next door to get the green tea cheese cake, hardly ever a lineup there, and it's just as legit."}
{"text":"Came at 1PM noon and there was no customer at all. Glad that I didn't have to line up. $10 for a cheesecake is honestly a fair price, considering other regular bakery shops would have $3 and up per slice.

The cheesecake was quite lightweight in cream cheese but that is how it should be. It's soft, fluffy and not too creamy. I brought it home and kept in refrigerator for 5 hours and it tastes best when it's cold, in my opinion. I don't buy it regularly but it is a good treat  whenever I need sweet fix. 

Overall, I totally recomend this place for its authencity and affordability. Just try to come during noon time weekdays so you can easily enjoy one without the lineup."}
{"text":"Uncle Tetsu Hack: How to Eat The Perfect Cheesecake

1) Pack cold hard cash: $20 should do between 2 people. $40 if you want to order for a family of 4. No credit or debit cards, no lucky money, no chocolate money - cash!

2) Go early: The store opens at 11:00 AM every day, but people start lining up at 10:00 AM. Might as well wait for an hour and be first, than wait 2+ hours during the day.

3) Go with a friend: It's more fun waiting with someone. You will wonder why the friggin' line is so long! Practice yoga breathing techniques to quell your impatience.

4) Stick to the basics: Order the heavenly 6\" cheesecake. Skip the madeleines (basically sweet muffin-like sponge cakes). Recite your order and pay like a pro.

5) Be cool: For the best taste, go home and put your cheesecake into the fridge for 1-2 hours. It should be chilled so that it fully sets and becomes fluffier.

6) Enjoy within 1-2 days: Now that you've mastered the prep, it's time to enjoy your hard work! Slice your cheesecake and savour the light, cloud-like deliciousness!

A total of 4 stars for the extraordinary quality of the cheesecake, minus 1 star for the tiny venue and hyped-up line-up. Was it worth the wait? Yes, go treat yourself."}
{"text":"As Japanese cheesecake, it is light, fluffy and not too sweet. Although it is sold warm from the oven, you must resist the temptation to eat it right away since chilled Japanese cheesecake is denser and creamier. I even took one home on the plane and it was still perfect the next two days."}
{"text":"Decided to try it after hearing so much about it and although it was good, it wasn't amazing. The cheesecake was fluffy, but I didn't really enjoy it as much as a regular cheesecake. The madeleines were amazing though, would come back for those."}
{"text":"I LOVE Uncle Tetsu! I am saying this after having tried all of the cakes (original, green tea, green tea & red bean, angel hat), and madeleines (original, green tea and green tea & red bean). I also tried Love Me Sweet in Thornhill which makes similar cheesecakes but it's not the same. 

Their products are always baked fresh and most of the time are still warm. My favourite cake is the green tea and red bean and same with the madeleines."}
{"text":"Perfectly balanced, with a delightfully harmonious blend of fluffiness and creaminess. It is far distinct from your typical northern american style cheesecake and much definitely worth the wait times!"}
{"text":"Finally waited in line (40 mins) for their famous cheesecake.
Fresh, it was really fluffy - like biting a cloud, because I know how that feels. You can taste some of the cheese, but it was more of a lightly sweetened sponge cake.
When refrigerated, it becomes a bit more dense and the cheesey flavour is more prominent. 
I like eating it both ways. 

Did I regret the wait? No, it wasn't that bad. They offer free wifi so I pretty much played with my phone the whole time. It's not often I get a cake straight out of the oven orJapanese cheesecake cravings."}
{"text":"Waited 80 minutes in line with friends. Bought both the madelines and the cheesecake. 

The cheesecake was quite bland and was only redeemed by its fluffy texture. The madeline was a good combination of sweet and creamy but wasn't all that different from similar pastries that can be found at decent Chinese bakeries. 

Overall I would say that the cakes are overrated and not worth the wait. They aren't terrible though and are relatively reasonably priced, so if you're really curious and have time to kill,  eh."}
{"text":"Went on a Thurs night at approx 8:25PM- line was not too bad, was able to purchase a cheesecake and madeleines after an hour wait in line. Note that it is possible for the bakery to run out of cheesecakes which was a concern at the time and that it is cash only. It's warm inside the bakery and it smells lovely- the scent makes its way out whenever the door is opened. 

If you enjoy NYC cheesecakes for their richness, this may be a disappointment. This is very light, but more dense than a sponge cake. Similar to the cheesecake, the madeleines are light and not overly sweet. as someone who enjoys the rich taste of NYC cheesecakes, preferred the madeleines over the cheesecake."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I have a slice of Uncle Tetsu Cheesecake twice without lining up for hours. 

Japanese Souffle/Chiffon Cheesecake is really quite popular in Asia and in the Asian Community in Toronto. So this is not something new that Uncle Tetsu is \"baking\". And even Uncle Tetsu's brand which is originally from Fukuoka which still have 2 stores there is nothing compare to all the success overseas mainly in China with over 50 outlet nation wide. 

Competition for business for Western Japanese style dessert in Japan mainland is quite fierce as Uncle Tetsu is not an unique product but I have to give full credit for the brilliant marketing plans of Uncle Tetsu's team.

Would I line up for here in Toronto for one of their cheesecake?! No! It is not worth the wait!

If you expect having one and it becomes a life changing experience, you will be disappointed.

I have to admit that I like the soft fluffiness of the cake base and the subtle cheese taste but seriously not worth the hype.

Come before 12 am at Toronto Street Foods at Outside Union Station for 1/8 for $2 with no line make my Uncle Tetsu 's experience a 3 star."}
{"text":"Sunday night ; waited at least 20 mins in line at 9pm. It's OK, the cake is light and fluffy but this would not be something that I would recommend you to go out of your way to try or wait a long time in line for."}
{"text":"I've been a few times and there is always a line up! Be prepared to wait minimum 45 minutes. I love this cake chilled! A must try if you are in the area and have the time."}
{"text":"Very unique tiny shop with one of a kind cheesecake. There is always a crazy line but it's definitely worth a try. They make one flavor of cheesecake and once you bite into t you know why. It's basically like eating a melt in your mouth sponge while sitting on a cloud. It is delicious and wonderful experience when in the Toronto area. 

The flavor is very good and the texture is what really elevates the cheesecake to the next level but I do think it's mostly a novelty must try while in Toronto. If I lived there it's not something I would get on the regular. 

If you've never had one and you're in the area definitely stop by and pick up a cheesecake. You won't be disappointed. And you'll definitely receive an instagrammable product."}
{"text":"Their cheesecake weren't too sweet, and I love the matcha more than the regular one. Got them from the food booth near Union station. You don't have to wait in a line there"}
{"text":"If you've ever wondered what absolute perfection tasted like in the form of a cheesecake, look no further than Uncle Tetsu's.
Mostly what you're going to get here is the Japanese cheesecake. Super light and delicious cheesecake. Try sell a couple of other items that you can pick up such as cheesecake bite things, but really it's mostly the original cheesecake.
The shop is very small and usually packed, line out the door and down the street. If you come in the morning-before 10am there's no line at all. 
I highly recommend stopping here and getting a cheesecake."}
{"text":"If you want amazing cheesecake, the wait is worth it. $10 all in gives you a super soft, super light, super fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth cheesecake!"}
{"text":"As a disclaimer, please know that I'm a sucker for hyped up things like this because I'm a weirdo. On a Friday afternoon with nothing to do, I decided to line up for Uncle Tetsu's because I figured the afternoon line would be shorter than the lineup after work hours. I got in line at around 1:50 PM and I think by the time I left it was around 3:20, so about an hour and a half wait. I think I chose a pretty good time too, because later on the line just got longer and longer.

I bought a cheesecake and also four madeleines, for a total of $17.56. Everything is baked fresh, so the cake and madeleines were warm when I first got them and still slightly warm by the time I got home like an hour later. I tried the cheesecake first when it was warm and fresh, and then later on in the evening after I had chilled it, and I definitely preferred it chilled. When it was warm and fresh, the cake was hard to cut, and the slice pretty much fell apart when I transferred it onto my plate. It therefore did not feel like I was eating cake, more kind of like this weird, fluffy custard texture... not a fan. The taste was light though and I didn't mind it, but the texture threw me off because it felt all weird and bubbly and airy. After chilling, the cake solidified so that it actually resembled a cake a lot more. It's like this perfect texture in-between the rich creaminess of an American cheesecake and the light fluffiness of a sponge cake. Quite honestly I've never had anything like it, and I thoroughly enjoyed it! The flavour was also just as light, you can kind of taste a light cheesiness but it is not overwhelming. The madeleines were not quite as interesting, but they were quite tasty nonetheless when they were fresh and warm, and I mean you might as well try them after standing in line for so long.

As for the million dollar question: was it worth the wait? Honestly I really did enjoy the cheesecake, and I didn't even mind the lineup so much despite the fact that I waited alone. It got a little bit chilly and drizzled a little on the particular day I went, so that was a bit rough, but I've had worse experiences (i.e. waiting 7 hours in the winter for a $20 Rob Ford bobblehead...) so this was nothing in comparison. I wouldn't bother wasting my time if the lineup was more than 2 hours long, but I think anything between 1-1.5 hours is okay for this cake, and it is definitely something worth trying!"}
{"text":"I've gone back after the hype and everyone will be happy to note that the line's gotten shorter - hip hip hooray! When I went in April this year, I waited 2 hours for a cheese cake vs. the 40 minute line up today. In my opinion, it's not worth the amount of time spent waiting but it really is a good product (if you like it). I prefer the Japanese version over Western cheesecake because it's a softer, less dense, and not as sweet. It sort of resembles a moist sponge cake. Some like it fresh out the oven and others prefer it cooled in the fridge. I'm part of the latter team as it tastes less 'eggy' after the chilling process.

Madeleines are also a popular hit amongst the crowds and don't have the 1 per person limit like the cheesecakes. You can go right up to the counter and purchase them without the wait. I definitely prefer the taste - but not the texture - of the Madeleines as they're like a honey pound cake. I can't wait to see what else they have lined up!

I suggest you hang out in line with a few friends until you get a cheese cake out of it. Just cause YOLO."}
{"text":"Captain's log 08132015 Thursday morning 9:00am. 15 minute wait for 2 full Japanese cheesecakes at $10 each. Highly recommend you bring a friend so you can catch up on life while waiting."}
{"text":"Love the cheesecake and tart! Cheesecake was our family's favourite, not too sweet and very soft for kids. The tart is more rich in cheese and taste delicious!"}
{"text":"Uncle Tetsu's Japanese Cheesecake is a bakery originating from Japan, and specializes in Japanese cheesecakes. They opened up their first North American location to much hype about a month ago on the corner of Bay and Dundas. Lineups were up to 2-3 hours long, and people even lined up in the pouring rain. I was fortunate enough to try the cheesecake without lining up, as J and I were gifted one by his cousin (thank you!).
 
Currently, they only offer three options; original cheesecake, madeleines, and dried cheesecakes (in a plastic cup). Additionally, there is a limit of one cheesecake and four madeleines per person. However, customers are more than welcome to line up again if they want a second cheesecake. 

The 6-inch cheesecakes are priced at $8.88 + tax (which is $10) each, and Uncle Tetsu's Japanese Cheesecake only accepts cash as payments. The cheesecake was delightfully airy, light, and not too sweet. Personally, I thought that the cheesecake tasted a lot better chilled, so it's best to refrigerate for an hour or two before consuming. Uncle Tetsu's Japanese Cheesecake now opens at 7 am, so if you want a cheesecake then go early."}
{"text":"There are two pop up kiosks outside of  Union Station at the \"food market\" so I didn't have to brave any line-ups.  Just walked up at around 11:30am on a weekday and left with a quarter cheesecake slice (you can also get a whole one).  

It has a slight faint cheese flavour...but more fluffy egg than cheesecake.  Overall, I thought it was just ok.  I wouldn't buy it again but will likely try the matcha cafe one day (when there are no lineups!)."}
{"text":"Great Japanese cheese cake! Try the matcha one next door. Shorter line and more interesting flavour."}
{"text":"Shorter line up in the morning since Uncle Tetsu now opens at 7:00 AM. I waited for approximately 20 minutes. 

6\" cheesecake $8.88 (around $10 after tax, cash only)

The cheesecake has a subtle cheese flavour. It was creamy, light and airy. Although delicious, it was definitely not worth the typical 2 hours wait. My colleague felt it was not comparable to Asia unfortunately. There seems to also be a few cracked cheesecake in the batch of twelve. May want to request for one that is not cracked if you are making the purchase."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about these cheesecakes but they were too eggy for me. I am not sure what the hype is about.  It was just alright for me."}
{"text":"I believe this cheesecake store is actually a chain originating from Taiwan. Some of my friends visiting from Tokyo had a laugh because they had no idea why they had affixed \"Japanese\" to it and no idea why there was such a long line. I know that the recipe is derived from the Japanese \"cotton cheesecake\", but it's not quite the same. I wish they would make everything from scratch rather than what I suspect are mixes. My mom's is much better than these cakes and the ones in Chinatown are pretty much the same( but cheaper and quicker), they certainly don't compare to what you see in a bakery in Tokyo. There is a three ingredient recipe on YouTube that replicates as well. The service is nothing like you would see in Japan either which is unfortunate because I think they use the whole Japanese thing as a selling point. Its not bad per se, but it's not great, I would eat it, but I would never again wait for it. 
FYI: Yelpers, not sure if anyone cares but, \"jap\" is a derogatory short form for Japanese."}
{"text":"This is literally the softest cheesecake I've ever had. Must come and try it!!!
There is always a long line here, and I've always wondered why would someone spend like 30mins to an hour for a cheesecake, now I know why."}
{"text":"Making cheesecakes runs in my family. I've had tonnes of different kinds and everyone of my family members has their own unique recipe. So let me tell you I know cheesecake. 

Uncle Tetsu's is ok. Not creamy enough and pretty spongy. It's actually better cold too so the 45 minute wait for a \"fresh cheesecake\" is moot when I go home and cool it. They don't respect their customers time."}
{"text":"Worth repeating (previous reviewer's comment): \"don't expect a life changing experience\". 

It's good cheesecake, it's really good, but it's not so amazing that it'll ruin all other cheesecake for the rest of your life because now you've had the gold standard and can't go back. 

The best part about this cheesecake is sharing it with friends and family. It's become a coveted item due to all the hype. So when you bring one to the office, it's like \"I stood in line under the glaring sun during my whole lunch break to bring back this deliciousness that I'm about to share with you!\" It's fun to eat with people :)"}
{"text":"This place is definitely over-hyped.  Regardless, I had to try it out.  There was no line when I arrived, as it was around 3 p.m.  Got my cheesecake, took it home.  Smelled really good, the top part was kind of ruined because of the cloth they put over it.  It was a decent cake, nothing extravagant. 

If you haven't tried it, I'd try it out.  Just to say you did so."}
{"text":"I love the taste of this cheesecake. I like it better than those cheesecakes from the Cheesecake Factory. Thry are too pricey. I will keep buying $10 cheesecakes from Uncle Tetsu's because that is well within my price range. I'm trying to keep a budget here. The best food doesn't come cheap."}
{"text":"Uncle Tetsu's is honestly so bomb. It's the most authentic japanese cheesecake you'll get. The cheesecake is super light, almost like a heavy whipped cream texture and its very airy. It looks a lot like a pound cake but it's the opposite and it tastes exactly like a cheesecake but better (i don't like cheesecake usually)! It's so light, it could float. My mom waited over an hour to buy this and the maddelines. The maddelines are good but not as good as the cheesecake. If you have the time to wait, I would recommend you to try it! The name definitely lived up to its hype! My mom even said she'll wait in line again for the cheesecake! Try it and you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"If you hate waiting in line for rollar coasters, then you will have a terrible experience with Uncle Tetsu. Despite the small size of the venue, you can see the store for a mile away (where the end of the line is). Nonetheless, when I conquered the sixty minutes of pain, my impatience fortunately did not detract from the overall delightful that is Uncle Tetsu's Cheesecakes!

If you are a fan of dense desserts then the cheesecake is probably not well-suited for you. But if you are like me and love a light and easy on the stomach (or so I tell myself) treat, then I would highly recommend Uncle Tetsu.

Four out of Five stars. Only because the lines are absolutely horrendous during peak hours."}
{"text":"This Uncle Tetsu is located inside the GO Transit York Street Concourse. I walk by here every day and there's almost always a lineup. I've tried Uncle Tetsu's cheesecakes before, but had nothing to compare it to. But now that I've had Japanese cheesecake in Japan, I had to try it again for comparison.

For $10, you get a pretty small cheesecake. The cheesecake itself is very light, soft, and airy. However, the flavor is much more eggy. There's much more of a pronounced egg after taste than the ones I've tasted in Japan. Overall, a decent place to get Japanese cheesecake on the way home from the office."}
{"text":"The cake was $10 after tax and the wait time was around 20 minutes in Winter. I've wanted to try it because of the hype. It was an okay deal since you can get other cakes for the same price. After trying out the cake, I liked it cooled. However, I felt like this cake was not worth the hype!"}
{"text":"Wow! So excited to finally try some Japanese Cheesecake from this place! This place is super popular and busy for a reason, they are damn good! I walked by this place several times and there was always a line up so I didn't really bother. I managed to come by during a less busy time (1pm on a Wednesday) and was able to walk right in. They sell smaller sized, whole cheesecakes which are good for approx. 4-6 people at $10 each and they limit it to one per person. I got my lil box, which was freshly prepared, so it was still a little warm, which you'd think is odd for a cheesecake but oh my god it made it even better. It was incredibly soft, fluffy and had a light cheesecake taste. It's really all about the texture, so it might be hit or miss with some people depending on what you like but I thought it was perfect. Try and go during the day on a weekday to better your chances of not waiting in line. Definitely worth it if you get the chance to get some, I wish I was able to get another to bring back home with me."}
{"text":"A light and fluffy cheesecake - I enjoyed it! 

Also, my friend bought it so I didn't have to wait in line."}
{"text":"First time visiting Toronto and a friend recommended this place to me. I'm not really a big fan of cheesecake... but my god this was amazing!! So soft and delicious! No wonder why there's always a long line up for them. It sucks they only let you buy one per customer, if you really wanted more you'd have to go in the back of the line to get another. When I left Toronto, I had to bring some home with me. I bought 16 of them.. yep call me crazy, but everyone loved it back home.

Ps. If you want to buy large quantities I suggest you head down to the Uncle Tetsu Angel Cafe. It's only about three blocks away from this location."}
{"text":"I thought Uncle Tetsu only had a cheesecake shop, but right next to that shop Uncle Tetsu has a Matcha Cafe! 

This is not a place where you buy your food and sit down to eat it. Its a small space, but its worth a visit especially if you like Matcha. 

They have a small menu, and I ordered what was available, which was Matcha Madeleine's ( it was buy 3 get 1 free, so I got two plain Matcha Madeleine's and two with red bean), and I also got Matcha and Milk ice cream. 

The Matcha Madeleine's came straight out of the oven so I had them when they were hot. They were light, fluffy and sweet in taste and it was not dense at all. The Matcha flavour was light and sweet, and not over powering. I preferred the Madeleine's with the Red Bean paste in it (there was no actual red beans, just the paste if you were wondering). The red bean paste was sweet and gave the Madeleine's an extra flavour kick which I liked. (Also, I kept two of the Madeleine's to have the next day, and they were still soft and delicious the next day- I kept them in an air tight container)  

The ice cream was also Really Good. The Matcha ice cream had a stronger flavour (compared to the Madeleine's) so I am glad I got the ice cream mixed with the Milk flavour. I think the milk flavour is supposed to be like a vanilla , but to me it kinda tasted like the remaining milk you have when you finish all your cereal. You know how that milk is sweet (but not overly so) because of the cereal? It tasted like that, so it was a good balance between them. 

Overall, if you don't like Matcha Flavoured food then don't bother coming here.
If you Do like Matcha flavoured food, then Uncle Tetus's is definitely worth a visit. 
The food was good, prices were fair (I paid 13.48 for everything), and the staff friendly. 

I'm a fan of this place, and I would comeback and order the same thing."}
{"text":"Smells like cream and milk. If I could live in here I would. The 10$ cheesecake is out of this world! So light and fluffy! Get it! None of that heavy creamy America cheese cake crap here."}
{"text":"Don't let the 2 hour line stop you from getting this cheesecake. Come to the store in the morning and less than 20 minutes you get a cheesecake. I visited Tuesday and Thursday in the morning and the waits weren't that long. They freshly bake the cheesecake and you basically see where the cheesecake is being made. 

The cheesecake is very delicious when it's freshly baked or sitting in the fridge for a few hours. It's fluffy and not very sweet. And the cute Tetsu stamp is adorable."}
{"text":"I'm curious that why so many ppl are always lining up there. The cake is ok but do NOT deserve time to wait for more than 10 mins in lining up."}
{"text":"$10 for a small Japanese cheesecake is a decent price. We got gifted a cake from the nice neighbour so didn't have to wait in line for an hour.  

It's very different texture and density than Western cheesecakes. It's \"light\", fluffy, and not overly sweet. Cake warms up nicely in microwave the next day (instructions are on the box). 
Cake itself is good but not that original; nothing to rave about; you can get similar versions at certain chinese supermarkets. I would get it again if there's no line up. It's not worth waiting in line for."}
{"text":"Okay everyone.  Let me break it down for you.  This is a gimmick for folks who don't get out much. Hype for nothing to be honest.  My friend has been wanting to try it so we both decided to go and the line up was small so it was a good time.  As always I like trying everything so we decided to order the traditional cake which they only sell one per person:)  a box of medellines and the angel 2 cheese cake. 
The traditional cake is good but to give them 4 or 5 stars would be a lie:) 
The uncle tetsu guy sure figured out the secret sauce  to drive his business forward. .but he can't pull the wool over everybody.  A sucker is born every minute so he's okay to attract and sell."}
{"text":"Two days ago on a whim I waited in a line outside a Japanese cheesecake store, vaguely recalling I had heard something about it before. Just 45 minutes later (apparently it was apparently good day) I was rewarded with a fantastic cheesecake and four sweet muffins.

The cake as has been described by others is not your typical American style cheesecake. It's slightly crumbly, light and cheesy without being dense or overly sweet. The down side is you must wait, you only get one, and you may only pay cash.

There is no fruity sauces, no graham crust, no pretentious wait staff serving you at some high end steakhouse. Honest to goodness, tasty Japanese style cheesecake. I can see and taste why it's so popular.

Could you add some sweet fruit or chocolate sauce on top? Of course you could. But why mess with great. If it's ain't broke don't fix it.

The madeleines are quit good as well, they make a nice accompaniment for coffee or tea, but again don't resemble a French style baked product. More like a mini cupcake with no icing. 

Enjoy but line up as early as you can.

My on major complaint stems from my first visit here. Cash handling skills are not part of the repertoire for the staff. I saw a young lad drop a box full of rolled coins and painfully take his time collecting them and filling the cash register.  You would think at 11 am the cash float would have been dealt with, the delay added 5 minutes to the wait.

All in all a great experience. And I hate waiting in line for anything, but don't mind waiting here."}
{"text":"The lines are absurd! I heard the front street location is a lot better but they always seem to be sold out of their cheesecake! 

It was really nice and fluffy! I thoroughly enjoyed it but couldn't wait the recommended refrigerators time!"}
{"text":"FLUFFY CHEESECAKE?!? You simply cannot go wrong with cheesecake especially this kind. It's super fluffy and moist. The way it was prepared will make you go back after each bite. 
I'm a huge fan of cheesecake and this interpretation was uniquely different but in a good way! 
It is not dense like a New York style cheesecake, it's kind of like a mixture between yellow cake and egg custard. 
Each bite had this melting sensation in my mouth. YUM! 

Yes, you can say I'm a dessert addict! 

Would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"This place is overrated and overhyped with the long queue. The cheesecake is indeed fluffy and almost melts in my mouth, but the taste is mediocre at best. The only way I can finish this is by mindlessly eating them while scrolling insta or something. Wouldn't spend my $10 and 25 minutes of waiting again for the cheesecake."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait at least 15-20 minutes for your cheesecake. The cake itself is super soft and tastes amazing when served warm and I would definitely recommend trying the madelines as well. 

It sucks that you can only buy one cake per person but I guess that's how they keep up with the demand. Wouldn't wait if there was a super long line but definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"After seeing a viral video of Japanese cheesecake, I needed my fix. When I found out that Uncle Tetsu's Japanese Cheesecake was opened in Toronto, I was ecstatic! 

I was shocked when I arrived at UTJC to no line! I was ready to wait in line, my fellow Yelpers have forewarned me about the long wait. 

The place is really small with no seating whatsoever. The bakers are busy in there making these delicious goodness. There is enough room for you to buy your cheesecake and leave basically. There are samples to try before you buy. The sample was so delicious. $10 CAD per cheesecake and I've heard there's a limit to one a person. 

I bought one, but I wish I had bought more. I didn't eat the cake until a day later. I was saving it for my dad's birthday. I followed the instructions on the box to reheat the cake. Within minutes of cutting the cheesecake, it was gone. My family loved it. It was light, airy, and fluffy. I don't like American cheesecake like that, but I loved this. I'll be back. 

If you like matcha, go next door. They also have a lot more options."}
{"text":"Cheese cake is ok, definitely not worth the line up though. I know its fresh cheese cake but it taste better cold anyway. So save your self the long wait and just buy some sponge cheese cake at T&T it tastes almost the same and you don't have to wait two hours."}
{"text":"List of favorites (from most to least)

1. Matcha Ice Cream 
2. Matcha cheesecake 
3. Original cheesecake

Verdict: Get the matcha soft serve cream! IMHO, I think the ice cream is worth more rave than the cheesecake. While the cheesecake is good, I do feel it's not worth for me to travel 300+ miles from NYC just to get it.

But still, pretty solid place and do not mind coming back if I'm back in Toronto"}
{"text":"Came here just before heading onto the UP on our way back to Vancouver.  What does one bring home as a souvenir from Toronto when you can get most of the same stuff in Vancouver?.....Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake of course!...well really just because one opened up in Vancouver two days before we were going home and people waited up to 4 hours to get their hands on one.  So I figured I'd bring some home for the kiddos who have a good head on their shoulders and decided not to bother waiting.

There was no wait at 5pm on a Saturday, so picked up 4.  Cheesecakes are $10 each taxes in.  Surprised to find out they're selling for $13 each in Vancouver...no idea if it includes tax so essentially I bought 3 and got 1 for free without waiting in Vancouver terms!  Lol

Anyhow, tried the cheesecake the following day.  Everyone thought it was only ok.  My daughter thought it was too sweet, my youngest niece liked it, my eldest niece thought it was \"meh\", son didn't like it, mom thought it wasn't too sweet so she liked it.  The rest of us though it wasn't bad but definitely not worth a crazy wait! 

But then again, may have to try it again one day super fresh out of the oven....or maybe not, just try making one yourself as there's tons of recipes online!"}
{"text":"Are you ever one of those people who walked by those long lines and moan, \"pfft! I bet it tastes the same as those Japanese cheesecakes you find in Chinese bakeries, no queues there suckers!\".

Well, we were one of those aforementioned people and decided to stage a CHEESECAKE SHOWDOWN between Uncle Tetsu & Chinatown Bakeries. 

A friend of ours was nice (or fanatic) enough to queue for about an hour and he brought it back to kitchen stadium for a face-off (Iron chef reference here)

We had another friend who never-before tasted any of both and proceeded to, of course, blindfold her. The results of the blind-test -- my fellow cheesecake enthusiasts -- are staggering. 

The following is what she said when she first tried the Chinese Cheesecakes:

\"hmmm... abit dry...\" 

And as she finished the previous morsel of cake then went on to taste a mouthful of Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake:

\"THIS IS UNCLE TETSU\" --and proceeded to remove her blindfold as a new-born connoisseur. 

We all then proceeded to feast upon the cake. The story ends.

** We would give Uncle Tets a 4.5 stars! **"}
{"text":"I went in once when I was walking by and the line wasn't too long. The place is definitely in demand. The cheesecakes are tasty - I brought one home for a family dinner, and everyone loved it. Don't know if I would wait in a long line, but I would go back."}
{"text":"Tried this cheesecake for the first time a few weeks ago. Was delicious and like nothing I have ever tasted. Usually not a fan of cheesecake because they are heavy - this one is airy and light and amazing!

Luckily I had a great friend who picked it up for me so I did not have to brave the line. I think she went later in the evening on a weekday and it wasn't so bad. Not sure I would wait an hour for it but tasty none the less."}
{"text":"The cheesecake here is delicious. It's light, fluffy, and the texture is like a cross between a cheesecake and a very light vanilla cake. I barely have enough self control to not eat the whole cake in one go. 

Someone picked up the cake for me but I heard the line can be up to an hour. And while it's really good I don't think it's good enough for that kind of wait to be honest."}
{"text":"The cheesecake is good, it's very soft, spongy, and not super sweet. It's a different dessert but definitely not worth the wait or the long line. I'd rather have the madeleines. 
They only take cash so be prepared."}
{"text":"Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake has been opened for a bit but the lineup is still long. My friend lined up for 2 hours to get in. Once you are in you are allowed to buy one cheesecake per person. There are also madeleines  for sale. 

I was lucky enough that someone lined up and got a cheesecake so I can taste. Apparently the batter for the cheesecake is all hand mixed. They only do about a dozen an hour so that's the lineup. 

The cheesecake is light and soft. Tasty but a little bland. I would buy it and gladly eat it. But i wouldn't line up for it"}
{"text":"This is defiantly the best cheese cake I ever had. 

Remembered this is Japanese style , so it's super fluffy not as thick or creamy as western style. But damn it's so good! Seriously melt in your mouth. I could eat the entire thing on my own! 

$10 super worth of quality cake! 

Again, like a lot of business in Canada . Only accept cash or Canadian debit:"}
{"text":"Limited choice, too much buzz decided to try it. Liked the little appetizers but wasn't crazy about the cake"}
{"text":"I luckily didn't have to wait in line, as many others have - I wanted to give it a try as I had walked by a few times when there was a line. The cheesecake is good for one or two people, better fresh, but can be kept for a couple days. Extremely soft, fluffy, but not too creamy. $10 for a cake, if there was never a line, I would be getting it all the time."}
{"text":"So, not the best cake I've ever had.. But pretty damn close. I ate my cake as soon as I bought it and it was really really good. 

Very light and fluffy and eggy. It all depends on what you like really. 

For $10 it was worth a try. I only waited 30 mins on a busy Friday night which wasn't horrible. 

The Madeleine's were kinda dry. Which is normal I guess. Can't compare them to the cake. 

I would return, but not any time soon."}
{"text":"I waited in line for less than a hour, which seems to be very short compared to other wait times. I ordered the Madeleines and the cheesecake. The Madeleines were like oily pound cake and the cheesecake was very fluffy and creamy. I personally thought the cake was better than the Madeleine. Would maybe come back."}
{"text":"overhyped. tastes like raw eggs. texture is very bizarre. definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I thought that the cheesecake was alright, nothing special. I've had Japanese cheesecake before and this was not much different from that. I guess I'm lucky that there was no line when I went and I didn't have to wait in the cold for my cheesecake. Would I go again? Maybe not to this particular location but to the one in Unionville to try their other flavours."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand why this doesn't get 5 stars because it's hands down the best Japanese cheesecake I've ever had. It is NOT supposed to be dense and rich like NY cheesecakes because Uncle Tetsu is Japanese and he doesn't make American cheesecakes. Japanese cheesecakes are known for its light, airy, smooth, fluffy, and melt-in-the-mouth texture, and this PERFECTLY describes all of those characteristics. Not to mention its perfectly round and delicate shape as well as the innocent-looking watermark begging you to not cut through it because it looks so pristine. But once you bite into it, I'll assure you that your world would be so much brighter because it WILL be an enlightenment. It IS the definition of melt-in-the-mouth especially when it's right from the oven (I found solace in its warmth) and the taste is just so perfect (not too eggy, excellent balance between sweet and salty). And yes, the texture does MAGICALLY change after an overnight refrigeration. It somehow becomes a little denser but it still tastes heavenly when you eat it cold. It only took me 30 minutes to get to the front of the line but I would totally line up for 10 hours for this. (Although, the madeleine is a disappointment cause it's a little dry and it doesn't have that rich of flavor as the cheesecake does. But I didn't care as much about the madeleines once I tasted that heavenly cheesecake.)"}
{"text":"Paid a visit to the cheesecakenazi once again last night (no not the soupnutsy).

Even if the last time I visited I only had to wait 2-3 minutes (around noon) it was evening time and the wait was one hour. Yes, one hour. Never again. Really! I am not sure why it took so long because that line-up would usually take 20 minutes, but it did take that long.

The good part is still flavour: the soft and light-tasting sponge cheese cake. The cute bags also help give it character.

Here is the very sad part: the propaganda. There is a sign on the door advertising for jobs. It is clear that no Canadians may apply because one of the conditions for applicants is a 'Canadian work visa'!?!? Canadians do not need a work visa. That is strange because the Japanese cheesecake place is now mostly staffed by local Asian-Canadians who know no Japanese and probably never ever been to Japan. Two staffers were even chatting to each other in Chinese when we got in. y
That's fine of course, but it is all strange.

What is really irking me is the lengthy essay posted on the window about why it takes so long to get a cheesecake. \"we use quality ingredients' (not clear what this has to do with time needed) or 'we use farm fresh ingredients from the farm bla bla' (again, what is the connection?? and also the box after box of wholesale Philadelphia cheese in your fridge tell another story), etc.

Face it: all it takes to alleviate the line-up is to buy another oven and put it in there (just like they did next door for their matcha green tea shop which is a waste of space) and voila you cut the wait time in half. Put two new ovens and you cut the wait time to a third and so forth! That is all. 
So instead of irrelevant false explanations and distractions they can easily cut down the wait time, but won't do it because Uncle and his Canadian business partner love the line-up and see it as a very useful marketing trick. Uncle and his investor like cash and marketing more than your time or the truth. Period.

One more thing since every cheesecake is bringing in 500% margin and profit I think it is time for the uncle to begin accepting credit cards. Surely, he can afford the $0.20 charge at this point (but of course he does not want 480% profit, right?). My local bakery where I buy $2 buns from accepts credit cards.

The fastest way to get Uncle Tetsu to become truthful and respectful is to have one of those Chinese knock-offs open up a 'Japanese' cheesecake store very nearby. Quickly losing business to a cheaper and faster competitor the Uncle will quickly push one of the cupboards or tables or cabinets to the side and buy another oven and pump out twice as many cakes...."}
{"text":"I'm glad the hype isn't as strong anymore. I remember trying to line up and giving up within 5 minutes multiple times last autumn and January '16. I went this morning (Monday) at 10:30am and there was only one customer in front of me!! Success at last! I ordered two original cheesecakes. Tax is already calculated in the $10/cheesecake. 

Like everyone says, light and fluffy. It reminded me of chinese egg cakes, but a lot fluffier, with more cheese, and less sweetness. I really liked it and will definitely come back for more, so long as I don't have to wait too long."}
{"text":"Walked by on a Monday evening and there was NO LINE. Never seen Tetsu's without a line before, so of course we had to go! We decided to head over to the matcha side for a few madeleines - one plain & one with red bean paste - and WOW! They were fresh out of the oven and the matcha added great flavour. I might be Tetsu a convert, but only if I don't have to wait forever in line!"}
{"text":"Oh My God! Stunning is all that I can say. Simply amazing cheesecake. And totally worth 10$. The presentation, aroma, portion justifies it. OMG cant wait to be back. I havent tasted anything so fluffy and delicately tasteful."}
{"text":"Anyone who lines up for an hour for cheesecake should only be in a  third world country.  Anyone who does it here...for this cheesecake, is an idiot.  It's fine, but it's nothing to wait even 2 minutes for.  Fortunately I had a neighbour bring some home."}
{"text":"I had someone else stand in the long line for me to get these cheesecakes, the wait was abt an hr, hence the 4 stars. The cheesecake was the best I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"We waited in the line for 90 minutes. Nothing is worth a 90 minute wait. They also have a cap of 1 cheese cake per person. All that being said, it was delicious."}
{"text":"What a lineup! But it was totally worth it as we finally got a taste of pure, cheesy, spongy heaven. Uncle Tetsu makes 12 cheesecakes every 15 minutes fresh from the oven. So expect to wait at least 30 min in line outside to get a cake! Oh and while you are waiting, why not try their matcha ice cream? It's fresh and light. A delightful pick-me-up."}
{"text":"food: I love their fluffy cheese cake, because it's very light yet flavorful. 
I have never been to the store or lined up myself, so I couldn't comment on the service or environment. Judging from the forever long line up, it remains its popularity by the unique cheese cake."}
{"text":"I've had the Original Uncle Tetsu cheesecake once and I truly believe that it is not worth all the hype. Yes, it is very light, fluffy and moist, with a little bit of creamcheese flavour which it is infamous for, but for 1.5 hour wait time doesn't seem worth the time. If they had more staffing and locations, I do think it is a good Japanese cheesecake that lives up to its name.
I opted for the lesser wait today, which was for the Matcha green tea cheesecake with red bean, and also a Green tea latte. Both have very strong matcha flavours which I liked, but I agree with some of the others that the matcha flavour kind of overpowers the creamcheese flavour. However, for a 8 min wait, it was totally worth it for myself. The latte reminded me of a Green tea Starbucks latte as well which was not bad but I could have went to Starbucks instead. The madeleines are tasty as well, but a bit overpriced (2.75 a piece)."}
{"text":"So I have always seen a huge line outside this place and always wanted to try to see what the fuss is all about. Last night it was a short line so I went to buy their cheese cake.
It was a disappointment. I was expecting something out of the world. The cake was too eggy. Very light. Not quite sweet. It tasted more like a foamy pound cake instead. I was disappointed. Sorry !"}
