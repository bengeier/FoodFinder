{"text":"Pizza was decent. Very disappointed in the delivery. I was told it would be at my house in 45 minutes, but it came in less than 30 which I was not prepared for and caught me off guard. I'm very mad and furious at the horrible customer service, but the pizza was good tho"}
{"text":"Really good pizza with quality ingredients, definitely a better option than any other pizza shop on 286/380 stretch of road in Plum/New Ken"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza's in town.  Easily 5 star but I'm giving 4 since they simply won't deliver into mount Vernon. They will go to Wal greens but not 2 mins past up the hill,  just sucks.  But it's one of the best.  Id order alot more of they delivered into one of the best areas of new ken"}
{"text":"Hooray for good, hot pizza in New Kensington!
The place is small and really best for pick-up only. Friendly over the phone service, but the ladies were a little hurried (being that it was Friday night dinner chaos).
The regular crust is a medium thickness - not too bready, not paper thin; very nice. Good sauce to cheese ratio too!
The veggie pizza was my favorite of the ones we tried (Cheese, Veggie, Pepperoni, & Steak).
-1 Star for the cheese pizza being so greasy (dripped before I even took a bite)"}
{"text":"I have been ordering from here since I had moved to this areas in Nov of 15. I initially it was really good. In the last 6 months or so it had dramatically worsened for me. Wrong food delivered several times.  Cold food. I had picked up a pizza that had looked to have been assembled by throwing the toppings at it.   I once was delivered a pizza that was half eaten. Apparently the guy grabbed an employees pizza by accident....  he seemed embarrassed about it.... I ordered an Italian sub no cheese. It came with meat only. Nothing else, not even dressing. 
but I cannot return here until this has been proven Improved."}
