{"text":"I was surprised how big the court yard and how spacious the restaurant are. Went there on a off peak hour afternoon. Still have few tables finishing/ starting their late lunch.   I tried the shrimp empanada for appetizer and ordered the \"back to life\" cocktail.  Their shrimp empanada was deep fried, but not greasy at all. It was crisp with juicy shrimp in it. This appetizer came with a green sauce. I honestly felt that \"sauce\" is just liquified jalapeno. But this appetizer itself is tasty enough to be needing any sauce.  The basket of chips and bowls of salsa was delicious and fresh made. Chips were not stale or over salted. The salsa is house made and delicious.  When I got my cocktail I was shocked, unlike any cocktail I ever had before, it's not served in a pretty glasses cup. It's served in a gigantic bowl. Also, not like the usual cocktail I enjoy, it didn't come with much variety of seafood. It's loaded with shrimp, and couple other pieces of this and that. I am not sure which is it, but one of the seafood ingredient was not fresh and taste spoiled. I didn't get sick afterward, but I also was hesitant to continue eating after the spoiled experience.  Surprisingly, I will totally go back there again. I will just stick with cooked food next time!"}
{"text":"Worst Service you can get, the waitress takes your order and you don't see her again, if you need anything you have get up and find someone to help you, food was decent a little pricy for what you get, we spend $70 dollars on two people, ( 2 entrees 1 app)"}
{"text":"You must try this place, the service is so kind and amicable and the cook is amazing for sea food prepping!!!"}
{"text":"I found this place in May 2013. Since then I have been to that place more than ten times. It's a whole different experience of Mexican food!! I never really liked oysters until I tried their Vuelve a la vida oysters. They're a bit pricy but I have come back to this restaurant mainly for them. Their tostadas are great too.  I tried the shrimp and octopus one and it was great. I also tried a creamy shrimp dish, forgot the name of it, and it was awesome! I have also tried a deep friend whole fish and it was great.  Oh and their complimentary ceviche is to die for!!! Finally, you gotta order a michelada, it's a great drink!  The waitresses are really nice. Most of them don't speak English but that makes it even more fun for me to try and practice what I learned from rosetta stone lol.   I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"VERY BAD service !!! Took my dad here for Father's Day ! Got seated then nobody acknowledged my family for 20 min !!! We had to get someone to help us !!! Took 10 min to get our drinks !!! Then it took an hour to receive our food !!! Mal servicio!!!!! No vayan a este pinche lugar!!! Las meseras estan mal educadas!!!"}
{"text":"Decent place, usually my go to spot for Mariscos. Great ceviche and cocteles. Might not be your best option if you're not too fond of raw seafood, since a lot of dishes contain raw or undercooked seafood. Also, live band all the time."}
{"text":"Well the food was great but the wait was very long..... I still recommend this Mexican seafood was a great experience just a minor bump lol"}
{"text":"Zero stars!!! Service and food was horrible.  Finally thought we had found a great authentic seafood eatery... Was completely let down.  Our food was served two hours post ordering.  Food was cold and the shrimp on ALL platters were NOT cleaned/deveined.  Management lacked all experience on how to handle our complaints.  Only decent thing were the Tecates and oysters.  Do not recommend and will not revisit."}
{"text":"This is by Ranch Market, awesome patio area when you enter, mexican steel statues, water fountain, tables and bar.  Very friendly staff, waiting for food you get chips, salsa and small bowl of ceviche.  *** Very good food and drinks, really liked the Azul Margarita w/ salt."}
{"text":"My buddy said it's the mexican red lobster. The music is obnoxiously loud but I guess they take breaks when it isn't busy. Besides the surround sound it was ok authentic Mexican seafood. The ceviche is decent if your into that, they bring it out with your salsa. You can't really go wrong with fajitas and the lemonade and pineapple juice were both tasty."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing!!! The food id Delicious and the atmosphere is just fun! They have Salsa Nights on Saturdays and the music is great! Definitely top 5!!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing like 34th ave. lol company code for 43th ave. This is the spot where me and by buds can drink for hours, the micheladas, out of this world. The chips and salsa are phenomenal. The tacos are delicious and the oysters are huge! Nothing like it, can't compare. Haven't tried the bar yet but looks enticing"}
{"text":"2/24/18. 6 pm. Fuimos. Un grupo de 13 personas.   Dividido. En 4. Grupos  para pagar.   La comida.  Estuvo. Bien   Rápida.  Las meseras.   Amables.  Perooooooo la cajera.  Pinché vieja.  Anadien now dio. Ni las gracias. Con ese tipo. De cervicio  jamaz regresó.  Ya Ke. Del cliente.  Ellas comen.    A poco mal.   Para mi 1 estrella.    Espero ke mejoren el cervicio"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Marcos!  Great portions and   great seasoning on the food!!! I will start coming more often for lunch.  Prices are reasonable and great family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not the best mariscos....portions are small. I got the breaded shrimp and they  had no flavor or seasonings...very disappointed,  will never come back....Everyone was telling me about this seafood restaurant ( how it's the best) ....i was very disappointed, it's ok cause i wont be back....the music is so loud ....i really don't understand why it's so loud, what's up w/ that, how am i supposed to carry a conversation ....so i had to wait for music to stop, it was soooooo annoying ...NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"They gave me  something that I didn't ordered. The food that I got had too much salt. The service wasn't good at all. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm usually a little leery about trying Mexican seafood places but am so glad I tried this one! Everything I've tried there has been very good but by far my favorite has to be the \"cucaraches\" appetizer, terrible name I know but super delicious! The shrimp in hot sauce and shrimp fajitas are also very tasty. Right when you sit down they bring out complimentary fresh salsa and shrimp ceviche so you can't beat that! The only downside is it can be very loud when they have the mariachis are playing so any attempts at conversating with your date (and the waitstaff) aren't going to happen."}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican seafood. Friendly people, mariachis, The armed guard at the door was even having a good time!  I'm guessing this place is not in a \"good area,\" but what do we know, were from out of town. It seemed fine to us.   I had the coconut shrimp and octopus, Greg had the shrimp ceviche. It was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Best Garlic Shrimp I've ever had! Salsa and guacamole were fresh and tasty as well! Place was very clean also."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Get the oyster appetizer, it's amazing. I also had the shrimp taco, wonderful as well.   Smiles and music. Great spot.   Feeling fortunate as we just got off a plane an hour ago."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I ordered one thing and another came. I wasn't told by staff what would come with the food, since the menu doesn't describe it either. Therefore, the \"just tacos\" came with so much more I didn't want. I ordered water and I was forced to accept bottled water, so there was a charge for that without warning. Food was terrible. Family and I ate the courtesy chips until we were full."}
{"text":"One start because there isnt ZERO stars. First we get there and waited for ever for service. Then the first server takes our order and send it in. We ordered a beer, no glass no attentiveness no nothing. We order appetizers first then our meal. Everything came out at the same time. When the second server brings all out food together, i stated that we ordered the appetizers first, she replies, \"thats how i received the order\".   Ok whatever, we send the food back so it wouldn't get cold. When we got done with the appetizers, 15 mins pass by and no sign of our server. Waiting and waiting, she finally shows and we told her that we were ready for out lunch.  Finally when we were ready to get the check, another 15 mins go by and no sign of our server. Anyways, the food was decent but customer service was horrible. I hope this helps."}
{"text":"When we walked in they offered to turn on the heat for my kids Service was good this time the server we had did a good job she was very attentive. The food was good as always."}
{"text":"They used to be one of the places for mariscos but their quality and service have gone down. One of the waitress was very rude and she didn't bring us the food we ordered and refused to change it. We left the place and were never going back."}
{"text":"H O R R I B L E! I would NEVER go back to this restaurant again. Waitresses have no sence of customer service. The music was way to loud and the serving portions are pretty small for the price you pay. The food was not great either and when I went to the manager it seemed like she didnt know how to handle the complaint."}
{"text":"The food and service quality has gone down. Went in with the family ordered a cóctel de camarón and a coco de camarón y pulpo which is a favorite of ours got two cocteles de camarón with pulpo. Ordered the siete mares it was cold with a lot of broth had very little pieces of seafood. I ordered camarones a la veracruzana oh man it was extremely salty thankful the rice was so bland it countered the salty canned shrimp.   The girl who served us checked in a couple times but never offered us to refill our drinks. When we asked for our bill it took her about 15 minutes to get it to us it wasn't busy they only had about five tables and three servers.   Then they have a messed up payment system if  you pay with credit card they ask for ID and write down all the info on id the girl wrote down ID # address. I asked why girl said its what they do and that was that. Never going back!"}
{"text":"For a Friday night, this place was loud with the Banda but almost empty.  I haven't been here in years but it used to be a very packed place.  They still took a very long time to serve us.  The Jamaica drinks (Hibiscus ) and Horchata drinks (Rice water) were very good.  The caldo (soup) in the Cóctel de Camarón was delicious but that was it.  (Shrimp cocktail )  Everything else was just bland.  The bad part was that everything was dirty.  The table \"looked\" clean but it had that slimy layer on top.  The salt, ketchup, and mayo bottles all felt that way too.  Even the kids Menu displayed in a topper on the table was greasy.  For what we were billed it felt like all that was missing was to be charged for the napkins and straws.  Seriously.  My kids waters were $1.50/each the same cost as a kids' juice or soda.  The other thing we noticed is that the menu said the kids meals were $5.99 but we were billed $6.25 for each one.  No worries.  The staff was nice and there was plenty of parking available as well as tables but I wouldn't go back even if they offered us a free meal.  Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"The food was actually not too bad, but the customer service could have definitely been better. While our server was really nice, the night started off rocky. I called earlier in the week to make sure there was no cover charge since they have salsa nights on Saturday. I was told if we were dining, there would be no charge. I made a reservation since there were 15-20 of us celebrating my birthday. When we arrived we were being charged $12 per person since there was a boxing fight on. I explained to the cashier that I was never told about the fight and the cover charge. She said we would not be charged, only to find out my whole party was charged anyway. We were there for my birthday! Not for the fight, and they should have honored the mistake that THEIR employee made when taking my reservation. If i would have known they were hosting the fight and charging, I would have chosen a different restaurant as I am not a big boxing fan. I was pretty embarrassed as people were asking why they were being charged. Also I had chosen this restaurant because the website says they have mariachi Thursday through Saturday. When I mentioned this to the cashier she said \"oh they're only here sometimes on Saturdays\" Hmm you might want to change that on your website then!"}
{"text":"As with any Mexican restaurant you expect fresh chips & salsa and this place does not disappoint!   Not only do you get a traditional salsa fresca but also ceviche salsa.  If you also want some heat don't miss the salsa verde (green) they serve with the shrimp empanadas...so good we put it on everything!   I already mentioned in my tip that the portions are well sized & well priced.  The patio is also a great place for small or large groups & instead are large family sized tables.  The only downsides - service was slow & the mariacchi ask for a $20 tip per requested song ($5-$10 is pretty standard)."}
{"text":"THIS place is really good , I don't know if the have a website but try the camarones pelados with guacamole as an appetizer , nice place and no lousy music at daytime"}
{"text":"We are in Phoenix for New Year's and visited at 2 in the afternoon on New Year's Day. Place was mostly empty and we waited a bit for a server to take drink orders. They brought out salsa and a small bowl of shrimp ceviche which was very good so we ordered a large fish ceviche. Also had cheese and chicken enchiladas which were good but nothing special, fish fillet stuffed with seafood was fantastic, beef burrito mostly full of beef and very good as previous reviewer noted and shrimp empanadas.   Overall the ceviche was outstanding along with the fish fillet while the empanadas had just chopped shrimp with no other seasoning or flavor inside and what appears to be a jalapeño purée with some tang to it. Despite slow service on this visit would highly recommend based on the stellar quality of seafood alone and other items were up to par in my opinion.    Additionally, the building and patio area take the ambiance to a whole different level. On this cool sunny afternoon it felt like we were enjoying a nice meal in a small town in Mexico."}
{"text":"The food is alright  nothing to rave about the portions aren't as big as they are at other places. The ladies  are always very kind and good service at this place the music was a little loud but I didn't mind. Love coming here with my friends on a Saturday night lovely atmosphere it's super chill"}
{"text":"Bring your ear plugs because your going to need them. The place is extremely small and feels over crowded. My friend and I went in to enjoy some seafood, but from the beginning it was a bad experience. We walked in and one of the servers accused us of trying to skip some people that were there before us. We didn't even know who to talk to in order to get on the waiting list.   After about 10 minutes of wait we were sat down. The table we were setted at next to the door so ever time someone walked it it hit the back of my friend's chair. So we asked to be moved and got an ugly look, but we moved to another table.   The food is very good just like seafood should be fresh! Everything tasted fresh we had oysters, & tostadas de ceviche (shrimp tostadas.) The micheladas are very good also if your over the age of 21 of course.    If the music wasn't so loud, I mean having a live band is such a small space is a horrible idea. You can't even hear the person across or next to you speak. This place definitely needs to make some changes before I ever go back."}
{"text":"Ayyyyy dios mio! I have never been so happy to eat Mexican food. Forget Filibertos and every other 'bertos place... Mariscos is the new spot for hangover food, feel-good food, comfort food or stuff-your-face food.   I had no idea what to order - luckily one of my girlfriends is Mexican, so she brought us some phenomenal dishes. One of them was a bowl of soup with every type of seafood (shrimp, mussels, lobster, clams, etc.) imaginable (mouth-watering). One of them was a mixed plate of chicken/beef/shrimp fajitas with crazy toppings (so freaking tasty). One of them was a chili pepper guacamole shrimp insane mix of a platter (delicious). Then, we had these drinks called Micheladas (spell-check that shit) which consisted of tomato juice and some weird beer. Instant hang-over cure, by the way.  They also have a stage with a live band that plays music while you eat! I haven't seen that since my Rocky Point days!   The service is a tadddd bit slow (we waited for quite awhile to get sour cream) but the waitresses are super sweet, and the food is heavenly, so I really didn't care.   You HAVE to check this place out."}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty, and the staff was very friendly; but when it comes to the food, it was not very good, it wasn't disgusting but it wasn't good. I had a tostada of fish ceviche, nothing that will make me come back, I also had fish tacos and those were okay."}
{"text":"So good!! We are on vacation and we stopped here for dinner and we were pleasantly surprised! Live music and great seafood!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Oysters \"Vuelve a la Vida\" they are sooo good I cannot wait to come back to AZ to eat some more."}
{"text":"Girls night out we decided to try some seafood here. Greeting was nice from the gentleman at the door however the waiter was not very friendly. The server brought us chips and salsa to the table took our drink order pretty nice gal. The other waitress came to our table to take our order and was rushing us so we got the cocktail $10.00 and asada tacos $5.50. The asada was fabulous  but the cocktail was super sour from all the lemon there was 5 shrimps in it. The only good part was the taco, live music and I took a bottle of habanero sauce to make up for the lack of shrimp.Sorry but I could not pay $30 for nothing. They need to check the cooks to make sure the cocktail is ready."}
{"text":"I've been to this Marisco place several times, and I've passed the absurdly loud music since the food I've been served has been decent. On today's occasion. My Aguachiles (the red kind) not only smelled rancid it also tasted like it. My husband was in need of a new refreshment and it took 15 mins. For someone to pass by (not our waitress who was too busy flirting with the band members at the bar) for us to ask for a refill. Needless to say, I did not finish my Aguachiles and now I'm kind of scared of getting some sort of infection later tonight for eating some of that rancid raw shrimp. I would not be coming here again since  this goes beyond a bad waitress, if they are serving rancid raw food here I can only imagine. Also the bathroom do not have stalls, the \"door\" is a shower curtain! Nope, will not be coming here! PEOPLE BEWARE!!"}
{"text":"I would love to rate their food, but we never got to try any.  My mother and I decided to try this place since we had a restaurant.com certificate and the reviews were pretty good. However, after about 20 minutes of waiting AND calling them from our table (yes, seriously) we never got any service, not even a glass of water! Maybe if we had brought a friend of Hispanic decent things would have been different.... Highly disappointed and offended."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Micheladas were the best weve had. Its great for large groups and perfect on a Sunday."}
{"text":"The music is so loud you cannot even hear the person next to you. Food is OK and the service is average. Unless they do away with the loud music I would never go back. So sad."}
{"text":"ok so i had been to this restaurant before a few times. Besides the waitresses that think they're good looking, the food was ok. I am from Los Angeles originally so my expectations for sea food are far too high, which is why i felt this place was probably the best place for ceviche. Well, I was wrong. I went yesterday 5/21/17 with my boyfriend and the waitress started off a little cold, sat us down, and took some time to take our drink orders. Then she came back around to get our orders, my boyfriend wasnt ready and she showed annoyance when he told her he needed a few more minutes. When she came to drop off our food my boyfriend and i caught her looking at something on the window but neither of us checked at what she was looking. 1 minute later my boyfriend tells me to move and i see him trying to kill a ROACH! This waitress was looking at the roach for some time and didnt bother to tell us. It couldve gotten in our food. She then comes and \"tries to kill it\" with ZERO real effort. She says \"ok i think it's gone\". Instead of offering us to be moved to another table, she just left us there. My boyfriend and i proceeded cautiously and then the ROACH WAS BACK!!!!! at this point we got so mad that we decided to get everything from the table that hadnt been touched by the roach and we moved ourselves to a table in the middle of the establishment away from the walls. Then she comes back and gives us attitude for moving. 20 minutes later the same waitress sits a new couple in our original booth without cleaning it. at this point my mind was made up i will never be back here. OMG DO NOT COME HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. We went there last night, waited nearly 45 minutes for a table and the place was not busy at all. Once seated, it took them an additional 20 minutes to serve our drinks and they placed one hot sauce and two chip bowls for 8 people...They also told us there was no horchata while ordering drinks. Soon after, the table next to us received 5 horchatas, and after arguing with the waitress, she went and got our table horchata... Upon waiting for around another hour, we were then notified that there was still an additional 5 orders in front of us. So, only have had drinks at that time, we decided to leave. When the bill came, we were charged $50 in drinks alone(apparently they knew they were not going to make money off food so they charged us a ton for drinks) including $2.50 for every tap water they put at the table!!! Horrible service and the place is shady as fuck anyway. Hope it burns."}
{"text":"We went here on Wed for my grandson's birthday.  We got there about 8 pm and it was sort of busy, and mariaches were singing. The waitress didn't speak English and we had questions about some menu items which were in Spanish. It took us awhile to order due to the language barrier [two dishes were described exactly the same in different sections w/different prices, and other issues] and her serving other tables. By that time, the place had totally cleared out, including the music. My son and his wife got their shrimp burro meals fairly fast, then quite awhile later when they were finished, my grandson got his bacon-wrapped shrimp [he wasn't hungry any more from eating chips, etc], and then 15-20 minutes later, I got my \"seafood stuffed fish\" [ I guess seafood means only \"shrimp\" and veggies on top]. It took over an hour for my fiancee to get his Zarande Ado Relleno [grilled whole fish w/veggies on top] and I had to request his side of tortillas that were to come with it. He had been sharing my food and eating lots of chips, salsa and ceviche because he was starving, so wasn't hungry any more. He took a couple of bites of his meal and packed it to go [as did my Grandson]--we had to leave because he gets up very early for work, and it was after 9:30. On a positive note, the salsa was one of the best I've ever had [would like to get the recipe], and that along with the chips and ceviche [nice perk], and Margaritas(!) saved us while waiting for our food. However, although servings were generous the seafood did not have much flavor, was overcooked and a disappointment after reading some of the glowing reviews. It was not the waitress's fault the food took so long and she comped us on a round of drinks while we waited for the last two plates. Otherwise, she was fairly attentive, but it was very frustrating trying to communicate with her, only speaking muy poquito Espanol and using hand gestures. She did apologize, and I was sorry it was a negative experience because we were there to \"celebrate\" a birthday."}
{"text":"Really great asada and shrimp burritos! Their 7 mares soup is amazing and almost the only thing I order. The ladies that serve are amazing and very friendly. Really good micheladas!!! Definitely worth checking out! Oh, and the live band is pretty kick ass!"}
{"text":"I ordered seafood tacos. It came with 3 tacos I ordered  One Fish taco and two shrimp tacos the fish were really good and the shrimp was ok.The beans were good and the rice went well with the beans . The service was not very good I had to get there attention for them to assist me I ordered a Michelada that was really good ! However I had to wait another 15 mins until they finally asked if I wanted another one by then I was done with my food . There salsa with chips tasted old and was so bland in favor ."}
{"text":"Very fresh and tasty seafood and other mexican plates. On Thursday if you buy a dozen oysters you get another dozen for free! And the oysters are a dozen for $11.50 that is the cheapest price I have found in Arizona so far. It's a little ways away but well worth the drive. Ask about their daily specials."}
{"text":"I suppose I'm mildly surprised that I'm the first reviewer here.  Am I missing something?    I mean, the place seems nice enough.  It's in a big market that seems popular.    Ah, what do I know?  I'm just a guy from out of town that happened to try this place out on a whim on a Wednesday evening when a lot of the local choices were closed (such as Carolina's which was my first choice).    I'm here to say that this place is pretty darn good.  I loved my Carne Asada burrito.  That thing had more meat in it than any burrito I ever had.  Literally, it was almost all meat.  No rice, some beans, a bit of cheese, and a ton of steak.  If that makes you happy, this will make you happy.  I even loved the little side of rice they gave which was a little more mild than you might expect, but I liked it that way.    I loved the chips and salsa, very fresh.  I tried a shrimp taco too, and found it good although the fried shrimp was a little tough and chewy.  That probably kept it from 5 stars there.    And the price couldn't be beat.  The burrito plate with a couple of tacos, and the free chips with salsa all came out to $13 total.  At least for this out of towner, I considered it excellent.    Maybe there are better places and I'll find those next time.  This place satisfied my Mexican jones just fine, thank you!"}
{"text":"Worst food in the world!! So salty took 2 hours to get a refills. Waitress rude manager doesn't care. I will never come here again. If you want high blood pressure come and order anything on the menu. Don't drink any fountain or ask for a cup if water it's worse then tap! Oh and don't ask for an appetizer you will get it after your dinner comes. You complain and they will tell you to come back when there not busy to get better service. Nice management NOT"}
{"text":"I been at this place  and the service its great . The food  its tasty . I like to go the . U  can enjoy your food indoors or outdoors"}
{"text":"I've been here several times to pickup lunch and the food is great so so good!!! So it hurts to have to give it 1 star rating because of their service but it really is that terrible. I've sat down to eat here 3 times and I don't know if it's because both my friend and I are women or what but those waitresses seem to pay the most attention to men you literally have to be on the lookout to get their attention otherwise they don't come to you my friend and I were clearly done eating and our waitress still took more than 15 mins to bring our check and it was not even busy it's crazy. I wish the owner or someone manager would see these ratings most bad reviews are based on the lousy service. Hire some people that actually want to work there is many out there! It's not fair to the restaurant that makes amazing food to lose customers because of these people and not fair to us consumers who are spending at least $60 bucks per dine in."}
{"text":"The michelada is a spicy beer cocktail was amazing probably best I ever had. I mixed it with Victoria Mexican beer.  I personally had the shrimp fajitas which were just perfect. We also ordered beef tacos, horchata $ ceviche.  Everything was prepared perfectly.  Service was also great and quick.  There was a band playing which was just too loud and mariachis walking the floor. overall a positive experience minus the 2 armed guards and a pat down at the entrance."}
{"text":"came here to eat and the music is so loud and annoying and honestly unneccesary. i dont want to listen to annoying banda and be screaming across the table to talk to my friends. lose the banda and maybe ill come back"}
{"text":"Not in the best neighborhood, but the food is pretty good here. They serve a small complimentary ceviche de camarón plus chips and salsa. Had the fajitas mixto, which comes with shrimp, steak, and chicken. I also ordered a modelo especial michelada. My girlfriend ordered a carne asada taco and fried shrimp taco, lots of meat on both. It was all very tasty. They have live music in the evenings. I went on a Wednesday and they had a norteño band that started at 6pm. If you plan to have a conversation during your meal, get there before 6pm because the music is loud."}
{"text":"Worst food ever...they should be ashamed to call those things fish tacos..since when do you make fish tacos with frozen fish sticks??? The shrimp cocktail was even worst and we order a guacamole with shrimp and the guacamole was bad. Our waitress disappeared and no one else came to help us. And please someone tell those guys playing music the suck and to at least put the volume down. Its a shame and a waste of space, you need to get a real Mexican seafood cook and get rid of the music..."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite  Mariscos Places (the other one is in Cancun). Try the Pescado Zarandeado (grilled fish)."}
