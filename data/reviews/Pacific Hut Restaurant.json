{"text":"Jesus! How many times did I tried to come back here whenever I crave for Filipino food hoping every time their food would get any better?! I was wrong!! And I don't think they would even plan on change their way of cooking to perfection! The soup were always served cold! The crispy deep fried pork was served cold and over cooked with still pig hair on the skin. Me and husband could barely chew it! The vegetables were bad, they're already yellow and soggy like \"bleh! Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!\" Oh and the service was really slow. They will starve you for half an hour before they could even serve the appetizer and your drinks!"}
{"text":"The poorest quality of food I've ever had. Whatever we bought from this brand is just disappointing. We tried a couple of times thinking we just had some bad choices with our first bulk. The \"hopia baboy\" tasted like raw flour. The \"adobong mani\" are not fully cooked! The rest of what we got are all poor quality and we never recommend this brand to be bought. They cut corners on ingredients and procedure. Like Filipinos can adapt to a sloppy quality since we have few choices here. Pathetic mindset!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good although one price of squid still had the black ink it. 

Service is so so."}
{"text":"Food was good but service is brutal. I sat down and ordered Bicol Express combo to eat in and also ordered Crispy Pata to go. I love the combo and drink all the soup. Service on the other hand was awful. I was ready to walk out because it took so long to even get the water I asked for. Kind of dissapointed about the Service Charge of over $3.50 on my $14 dine in. I guess the percentage of my total bill with Crispy Pata to go. I asked the waitress what is the service charge is for and was told it is for the kitchen. On the debit machine it is still asking how much to tip. I still give another $1.50 extra tip. As a Filipino I love to recommend Filipino restaurant to my friends from another culture but I may be hesitant to recommend this place for the poor service and the misleading service charge. I know they may be following how they do in the Philippines but take off the misleading tips on debit machine."}
{"text":"The 3 of us went to this restaurant last sunday. The biggest mistake I made was not looking closely at the bill as they automatically charged 10% service charge. Even after the automatic 10% charge, the card machine is still asking how much tip would you like to add which I gladly put a number in it not knowing the 10% was already being charged to the bill. 

Food taste is average. We ordered crispy pork which was very crispy but lack of taste and stew beef with a bland peanut sauce."}
{"text":"Was there last Friday night and enjoyed Crispy Pata, Sizzling Sisig, and Halo-Halo."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there on a Saturday at about 11:30 AM looking for brunch.  We should have turned around and walked out as soon as we walked in because we where the only customers in the restaurant but we decided to try it.  

The restaurant used to be a Rickie's all day grill and other than a few new wall hangings it was pretty much the same. I was expecting a Polynesian atmosphere of some sort.  

I found there where too many choices on the menu and a very poor description of the meal. It took us a long time to decide because I didn't know what I was ordering. I ended up with pork belly white rice and steamed vegetables. The rice was unseasoned the vegetables were bland and the pork belly was almost all fat with very little actual meat. The pork belly was prepared in a black bean sauce which was the best part of the meal because it had some taste. 

My wife ended up with a breakfast dish with a couple of fried eggs, some kind of sweet pork, unseasoned hash brown potatoes and a bun.

The prices are reasonable but the portions are small. 

The service was fantastic and it should have been because we were the only ones in the restaurant . One other couple showed up about half way through our meal. 

We will never go back because the style of food there is not to our liking."}
{"text":"Tried their booth at Taste of Calgary because a Pacific Hut opened right near me.  Wasn't overly impressed when I was the only one walking up to their booth and I had to wait a minute or two before I could get their attention (they were playing on their cell phones and laughing hysterically).  The pork thing that I got was mostly gelatinous fat with some bland vege's and super sticky rice (almost like pudding). I'll give the new location a chance just incase, but from what I've heard it isn't looking promising.  Too bad because a good restaurant would do well in that location.....but maybe not a Philipino restaurant because I live in the area and I don't think that the restaurant fits the demographic in any way."}
{"text":"Wanting to try authentic and traditional Filipino food, a couple of my friends suggested we come here for dinner. I let them take the reins on ordering because they'd know a lot better than I would. 

It's family style, so we got we got a range of things to share: calamari, pork knuckle, pork skewers, ragu beef and garlic rice.

Everything came out fairly quickly, and it was all really good. The calamari has this amazingly crisp batter and wasn't super greasy. I was forewarned that most Filipino food is either fried or heavy on the garlic - so be prepared! 

There was way too much food though, we didn't make room for dessert so I'll have to go back another time to try some Halo Halo."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now. And it was just \"meh\" both times. Granted we're not overly familiar with this type of food but we'll try anything a couple of times. 

The first time we went, we clearly didn't know what to order. The staff made n suggestions so what we got didn't end up making sense. This time around we ordered a bit smarter but I can't say I was impressed with any of the dishes. The server was much better though this time around. We tried the pork belly black bean dish (fatty but tasty), the chop suey (very gelatinous), BBQ pork skewers (not bad but cold) and the house fried rice (not bad).

The fact that they had 3 tables of people on a Friday night at 6PM probably says something.For what we paid, our experience could have been much better elsewhere. Too bad as I like to see independent restaurants do well and we have nothing interesting in our neck of the woods."}
{"text":"We decided to try something new and here we were looking at the menu, dishes looked/sounded really yummy. Server asked 3 times if we had already order :P

We got mussels, beef stew made with peanut sauce, and the house special rice. Got the beef first and it was all cold, not even warm, really cold. So we asked server to heat it up, she did and was friendly and all. 

Then we got mussels, they were tasty as they were baked with garlic and butter, that was the highlight of the dinner.

Lastly, house special, really bland/boring... maybe we had really high expectations... but it just felt like service wasn't quite there..."}
{"text":"I read the reviews about this place about the service being poor. I beg to differ. Our waitress came right away and asked for our drinks. Right after our drinks were served, she immediately asked for our order. Didn't even wait that long for our oder; 15-20 mins. 

The food was good. Although their beef nilaga was way too oily for my liking. Other than we were very satisfied with our whole meal."}
{"text":"Honestly this place does not even deserve 1 star. The poorest service I have ever received. Waited to be seated for 10 minutes even though there were plenty of seats open and staff just kept walking by not even acknowledging my party of 2 and the party of 8 standing behind us overflowing out of the doors. As we were waiting to be seated, a table of 4 in front of us walked out due to the lack of service.

After finally being seated, our order was quickly taken to our surprise; as we were expecting another 15 minutes to be acknowledged. First dish came within 10 minutes but was unfortunately the wrong order. This was quickly resolved and things seemed to be smooth sailing from there. (Apart from the telephone ringing nonstop behind the bar directly across from our table).

Upon finishing our meal we waited 15 minutes before I decided to walk up to the kitchen to ask for a container and our bill. Received the container and was told our bill would be brought to us. Another 10 minutes pass and our bill was finally brought by a different waitress. 

On the bill was a \"service charge.\" When we asked the waitress what this was for she stumbled upon her words trying to explain it was a 10 percent fee for dining in that is divided among waiters and kitchen staff. \"So a tip?\" We asked. I told her we never received any service and we shouldn't have to pay it and she said we had to as it was already included. I didn't want to be there any longer so we paid it. There was also an option to tip on the machine for what reason is beyond me.

Would not recommend this place to anyone which is unfortunate because I am filipino and I normally support local filipino businesses."}
{"text":"the guy who waited seems played out by the time we went around 1pm, not very pleasant and   helpful. We traveled long hours and was very hungry a friend recommended this place but turns out a huge disappointment on us. We will never ever come back. The fried chicken wasn't cooked really good and raw. Very horrible service they don't serve condiments not unless you ask, I don't feel like I am treated as a costumer should be treated when you eat in a restaurant esp. if you're tired and hungry from a loooong drive. They take service charge without your knowledge and plus you give tip at least for service that sucks!!!"}
{"text":"HAVE A FOOD ALLERGY OR DIETARY RESTRICTIONS?! Go to Pacific Hut: They don't care! They will serve you hidden meat not once, not twice... nope. THREE TIMES. Hidden meat in my fried rice, hidden meat in my spring rolls, I sent back the last dish because it was probably as full of pork as everything else. 

And no, there was no miscommunication. See, I understand Tagalog, so I heard the back and forth between the waitress and the cook. He was folding the meat in to the food so that I didn't see it right away.

Don't go here for their mediocre Filipino food. Go to 7 Seas instead.

As for the other people I was with that, do not have dietary restrictions; they all agreed the food was ordinary, bland and came out at odd times and out of order (fried rice came out as an appetizer... Why? It's supposed to be eaten with the entrées). If you've ever been to a decent Filipino restaurant, or your Filipino homie's house for dinner; you know that all the food comes out at the same time to be served family style. At Pacific Hut, they don't even give you the necessary condiments one expects with certain dishes, and those dishes are full of cheap subsitutions for ingredients that are already inexpensive. Filipino food is mostly rustic home cooking, so cheaping out on ingredients and then charging premium prices is a BS move. 

For example, their Bulalo. Bulalo is a bone marrow soup where the whole point of eating it is... for the marrow. Think, Filipino Osso Bucco. With soup. At Pacific Hut; they serve it with a giant bone in the center of the bowl, that only looks impressive when they set it down - That giant bone is strictly ornamental. THEIR BULALO IS A METAPHOR FOR THEIR MEDIOCRITY: Empty and flavorless!

Pacific Hut, Im disappointed and angry with you. Nothing on your menu is even remotely vegan-friendly. I come to expect that from Filipino restaurants, because I understand that the cuisine is largely pork and shrimp based... but most in town are savvy and try to come up with something for me to eat. Because, I don't know... most places in town like customers and money! And maybe I've been spoiled by the down home service in places like 7 Seas, or even Manila Convenience, where from the moment I walk in the door; I am treated like family. 

Not only did you not even try, you FUCKING SNUCK MEAT IN TO MY FOOD. Did you think that was funny? It's lawsuit worthy. You are a disgrace to the Filipino community.

Oh, and P.S.: Your pandesal, is the WORST pandesal I have EVER HAD. Calling it Pandesal is an insult to actual Pandesal, which is magically delicious! Yours is a hockey puck of donkey balls."}
{"text":"I brought my friends Nina and Dave here who wanted to experience an authentic Filipino breakfast. But our empty stomachs fogged our minds so instead, we settled for several of Pacific Hut's dishes:

-Lumpia Spring Rolls. Standard spring rolls, I honestly couldn't tel the diff between this and a Vietnamese spring rolls.
-Palabok. A little saucy to my liking but was rich and just right on seasoning
-Garlic Fried Rice. A perfect side dish as always.
-Bicol Express my friends loved this dish b/c of all the new veggies they've never tried before: okra, bittermelon. Nina had to apologize for hogging the last bits left as she dumped some rice to soak up the savory coconut shrimp sauce.
-Pork Adobo. Fatty, salty, and meaty. Filipinos know how to do pork and Pacific Hut presented this dish well

My only criticism is that for a Filipino resto, they don't have BANANA KETCHUP! But when I asked, our gleefully friendly waiter promised he'd bug his manager to have some handy next time.

One thing I forgot to mention is Pacific Hut's amazing decor. They have blown up images of the Philippines along the walls of their dining room. But they have a cool collection of black/white OLD manila pictures in the back worthy of being placed inside a museum."}
{"text":"Nothing else screams authentic homemade-style Filipino food than this beautiful restaurant! I've been here multiple times and each experience has been incredibly beautiful to say the least! There's a large variety of food that's available and I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to enjoy a genuine, family-oriented restaurant experience. Not to mention they have MUSIC to accompany the beautiful food!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, waiter was very rude and walked away while my friend was trying to talk to him several times. My first time trying Fillipino food, my friend said the food was subpar."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner upon the recommendation of a friend. I ordered the Bulalo and my son ordered the kiddie meal with palabok and chicken. The bulalo came with a big bone, the end of a shank and I was only able to get bone marrow the size fo a quarter coin. The rice was either not fully cooked or not freshly cooked as it was gritty.  The palabok was good, and judging by how my son finished his chicken then it must be good. The worst part of it was when I paid, they automatically add a 10% service charge. This is the very first restaurant in Canada where I have experienced this. If I was in New York I would have expected this, but in a shabby place and with not-so-good food? No way. I will never go back to this place again. I'd rather drive a bit farther to 7 Seas, where the food is way better."}
{"text":"good bulalo. Pancit canton a little salty. The inihaw pusit was not that good. Great Wall decor of old Manila and historic photos."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and at the other two locations.  This was our first breakfast at any of the locations.  We had the breakfast grande special which included marinated beef (tapa), marinated pork (tocino) and sausage (longanisa), a big portion of garlic rice and two eggs, which were perfectly over-easy (the white was well done, but the yolk was runny).  We also ordered the calamari which had a breading that was tempura-like.

The only missing star was because I couldn't find the hours on their website.  Google said it was open today at 8 am.  We show up a little after 8 and the doors were locked so we went to an Asian market nearby hoping it would eventually open.  We stopped back at 845 but still locked.  I called and was told they opened at 9 so we waited.  Well worth it.  The sign that said the hours of the restaurant was hidden by the shutter.  I would suggest that the owners clearly post their hours on their website."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this restaurant received such poor reviews.  My wife and I had great service and the food was excellent.  I am familiar with Filipino food (I am Filipino).  Do not go to a Filipino restaurant if you are vegetarian.  That would be like going to an Italian restaurant if you are lactose intolerant or a seafood restaurant if you're allergic to shellfish.  Filipino food is very meat-centric, in particular pork is even added to the \"vegetable dishes\"."}
{"text":"Their luncheon menu gave us a small chunk of seared pork chop and another course of a small thin salted fish with overcooked vegetables.  Their bulalo soup was just floating in fat with no meat.  Also, preordered a plate of filipino desserts last week for this week told them need to pick up in the morning.  We came in the morning and there was no delivery waited and decided to make do  with their days old sweets.  If they cannot commit to an order they should not commit and they did not even give a discount.  Never again and I will tell my filipino buddies the same thing."}
{"text":"i went there with my friend maybe 2 months ago....the food is good. authentic filipino food. the ambiance is ok. pretty big restaurant. however, the service...and the serving is not that great for the price they want. maybe because i know how to cook some of the dishes and i dont think it is worth the price they are asking for."}
