{"text":"I moved right across from Vivetha about seven years ago and would go in there often for take out.  Their shrimp linguini is decent. Some of the other dishes I've tried are too oily.  In terms of staff, turn over is very high and most of them look like they would rather be somewhere else.  During the summer the place is constantly packed, however:  their patio is very quaint, overlooking Queen Street."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Not again, the plates were overloaded with a mixture of everything and the quality of the food was bad. Good thing: Best thick balsique and good bread!"}
{"text":"My go-to place for a weekday breakfast! Good 'healthy' serving of breakfast of eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, fruit and salad! At a decent price! Dinners have also never let me down. Small quaint place, and my only complaints are that they don't open earlier (say, 7am instead of 8), and they open their second level more often on the weekends to allow the large influx of Beachers coming for their breakfast."}
{"text":"I think the food is really amazing here -like a five star bistro.  But the service ranges from just ok to truly deplorable.  Also, because of the amazingly low prices, it seems to attract a lot of people all of the time who order up mind boggling large supplies of house wine and wax obnoxious throughout your whole dinner.  In other words, no matter what time of day, it's guaranteed never to be restful.  One time, the staff let me wait for a table for 10 minutes and when one came clear, they told me it was reserved.  So, thumbs down to the staff.  But the food is truly wonderful.  It works very well to get take out.  You can order ahead and pick it up with no waiting.  And did I say the food was great?  Try the angry salmon.  They use real cream and fresh ingredients.  If you eat in, be prepared to be patient and don't expect it to be quiet."}
{"text":"I came here on a sunny afternoon in the summer. Patio was nice, and the place was super crowded.   Huge servings! The food wasn't bad by any stretch, but it wasn't really anything special. Maybe it was just my dish (grilled veg sandwich), because a friend of mine raves about them."}
{"text":"Such a gorgeous place. Day or night. Very romantic, great prices during the day, decent prices at night. The food is to die for and you get a ton of it. I love this place. If you want extremely fresh food with great taste and pretty presentation...this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Vivetha needs a complete menu (and food) overhaul   We live a stones throw from Vivetha, and I wish my review was a positive one... - since the staff are friendly, the place has a great little patio, and has sooo much potential. I have eaten there a number of times the past few years, the breakfasts are big, decent quality, and the place has a great brunch atmosphere.   However the lunch / dinner menu - is way too extensive, which is probably the issue. How can you master pasta, indian and then fusion dishes, I think over 100 options on the menu - Gordon Ramsey would have a hay day... The food is always over seasoned, way too salty, too much sauce (most seems to be from a bottle or have store bought sauce comprise a big part of their sauces). Its a shame since the meats are usually cooked well, there are some interesting pasta options but they are focusing too much on portion size, and far too many options and its ruining the restaurant. Recently I ate their fish special - the fish was cooked perfectly - the grilled shrimp accompanying was delicious but they claimed it was with a beurre blanc sauce but it was definitely bottled thai plum sauce with likely some butter added which made it so greasy, and then they added some grilled avocado. I love when chefs invent new interesting concoctions but this was such a fail, like most of the dinner dishes I have eaten there. I hope the chef reads this and takes note - I would so support Vivetha in a heartbeat, the potential is there but anyone that knows how to boil pasta and throw on jar of PC sauce needn't spend the extra money for having it served to you at a restaurant.  There are only a handful of decent (non burger, greasy spoon) options in the beaches and Vivetha could be one of the few that reigns here when the new condos come in and no doubt more restaurants along with them. I hope this is the case, but however until dramatic changes are made we won't be eating there again other than breakfast."}
{"text":"Took a friend out for an early birthday-lunch today and had a great meal. Started with a generous bowl of mussels, fresh-tasting in an incredible broth with lots of bread for dipping. Seldom happens but I couldn't finish my pasta special even though the rose sauce worked perfectly with the seafood. Again, lots of it, and the seafood was better than I've had elsewhere, with some sea-bass and scallops that you would have enjoyed as a main. My friend had the gluten-free pasta and said (for once) she couldn't tell the difference and it was cooked perfectly. A  glass of wine, some coffee and we're out of there, stuffed, with a doggie bag, for $65."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly staff (thanks, Dasia!), charming place. Three of us had dinner on a summer Saturday evening and by 7:30PM the place was very busy. Large (but not enormous) servings of food, and all dishes had a myriad of vegetables accompanying the meat portion. Vegetables included squash, red carrots, potatoes, green beans, zucchini, giant yellow beets, and roasted cucumber. All three meat dishes were extremely flavourful and well-prepared ... beef tenderloin medallions, a wonderful Roasted Garlic Pepper Crusted Salmon, and the bourbon and smoky Secret Ribs. The Caprese salad starer was perfect and quite large, allowing two of us to share, with a nice vinaigrette and lovely tomatoes. Decent but not large selection of wine (the French pinot noir on offer was excellent), nice atmosphere. We'd definitely visit again when back in Toronto. Recommended."}
{"text":"The pastas are fabulous and I've heard the breakfasts are good too. VERY IMPORTANT....I don't wanna argue with you about this. You MUST have the crepe for desert"}
{"text":"This is the best casual breakfast and brunch place in the city hands down. Portions are enormous and tasty and for the price CANNOT be beat. Service and atmosphere is friendly. It's always busy. This is our go to spot when we're flying solo or when we want to bring people out for brunch. Been here more times than I can count. Never disappoints. TIP: I'm not sure why, but they have an enormous menu for lunch and dinner as well, but stick to the breakfast and brunch. If you're not feeling eggs, do the chicken club sandwich (either Flavour is great). Don't do the veal sandwich - you'll be disappointed.   I love their eggs Benny or their classic Vivetha breakfast. They always have brunch specials as well usually including some kind of omelette and interesting French toast option (like stuffed with Brie or something)."}
{"text":"I have a really good friend who takes me every time I visit her to some nice restaurant in Queen East Beaches area. My first visit there was a to a place ViVetha, followed with The Beaches and then to Green Eggplant.   ViVetha is intimate, dark and busy place in the end of Queen Street. During our few visits there it has always been busy, but we have managed to be seated pretty fast. Menu is interesting and filled with so many goodies that it is hard to choose. Whatever we have had, has arrived very fast, smelled and looked and most importantly, tasted great. Portions are quite big, so I always end up taking something with me. If you have appetizer as we had, then your order probably will make it home with you after you have been struggling to finish it with no luck ;)  While the savoury food tastes good, I can't say the same about their desserts. Have had nice cakes twice and both times they have tasted like nothing and the worst part, they have had the taste of fridge to them....yaiks! The least I expect when munching my well-waited dessert, you know. BUT this haven't turned me off from ViVetha, as I will go back there, but just won't order a desert :)"}
{"text":"Great italian food, sufficient wine choices, great service dining in or taking out. Just an easy, local joint for dinner with family or friends. Reasonable for quality and options. They'll even switch the pasta choice from penne to linguini or leave out the bacon, for example, if you have picky eaters. The Caesar or grilled veggies are great starters."}
{"text":"We decided to hit Vivetha Bistro for an early dinner since we live but 5 doors away. I had heard outstanding reviews from locals and neighbours, but disappointing reviews on many websites. So I was dubious about the food/service beforehand.  It turns out that the staff are super friendly, and eager to please. Their house red was so-so but definitely drinkable. I ordered the scallop pasta which came with bacon, and a creamy tomato pesto sauce. I would say the scallops were overcooked so a litte chewy, and the sauce was ok. It tasted nice, but nice was all it was. My husband had the angry chicken pasta, and his comment was 'bland'. With a beer the total came to $59.61, which is about $30 more than it should have been.  My review sounds a little harsh but in all honesty, the food here tastes a lot better than so many restaurants in Toronto that it won't be a huge disappointment overall. Just don't expect a 4* kinda place. It's an OK place."}
{"text":"Great Italian / Indian food fusion, and great takeout too. I almost always order the fish or beef special."}
{"text":"I've had brunch lunch and dinner here and  it is always  delicious. Wonderful presentation and portion size . Compliments to the chef (s)"}
{"text":"I've eaten breakfast here twice. The first time it was only ok (I got standard cheapo bacon and eggs) and so I thought nothing of it.  I went back today for breakfast, and man, was it tasty! I had the special of the day which was a chocolate pancakes, comes with a chocolate-type syrup on top (I know... I know... but you only live once... unless you're Buddhist but I digress). It came with a ton of fruit (Strawberry's, blackberry's, banana) on top of the pancake, and I guess all breakfasts come with some melon, pineapple, and an orange or something.  It really was tasty. I took my mom here as she was visiting town, and she had to potato pancake with baked apples on top and said it was also fantastic.  The only reason I don't give this place a 5 is because it was too loud. Now, we arrived at 9:50am, so it was nice and quiet and we got a table quick, but at about 10:15am (right after Sunday church I suppose) the place filled up, the line was out the door, and it was really much too loud (a kid was crying hardcore in the line waiting, that's probably what it was). It's a small restaurant with only maybe 10-14 tables I'm guessing (they have a patio out front which I assume they open in the summer to expand capacity), so the acoustics really amplified that kid, as well as all the other people.  With that complaint aside, the food was fantastic. I've not had dinner there yet, but their breakfast was great!  Win!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Breakfast lunch or dinner. The weekend waitress Mo is a hoot! She never writes down an order and pretty much tells you what your order is and is rarely wrong. The portions have decreased a bit but I can still take half my breakfast home and have it for lunch! I really like the Prix Fix menu on Mon/Tues evenings. The lamb is my go-to. And like breakfast I only eat half the order and have the rest for lunch, the next day. You can't beat this secret, in the Beaches. Well worth the trip to the far east end of the 501 streetcar ride."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give this place a 5th star is because of the service. It wasn't that it was bad, but it seemed a little disjointed. OK, so enough negativity...  We started with Caesar salad and calamari. Calamari was a little overcooked but was really, really tasty. Onto the mains...I had the fillet mignon (special). I was told I'd get 3 pieces of shrimp with it, but only 1 came (and I'm not sure if it was a big shrimp or a prawn, but my expectations were not met). Tasty stuff overall though. My date had beef-tip penne, which was also good. For drink we had a Reisling, which was excellent, and not too pricey.   Overall, great value. I  would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came here for a celebration breakfast with my husband. We sit down and the server brings cutlery over. Instead of just grabbing a new fork she starts rubbing it off with her finger. She goes to place it and I said could you get get a new one. Instead she says it's ok and still goes to place it. I'm like you just rubbed it with your finger... she gets a new fork. I was so disturbed not because of it but I'm like if that's how she is about cleanliness in front  of customers how are things behind our backs. I won't come back."}
{"text":"I've had a few good to amazing experiences here, and a few really fell flat.  Once we arrived and despite our confirming in advance they didn't have gluten free pasta for our guest of honor. Careless. I think the meals were fine that time.  I had a pretty good crusted-fish dinner there with my mom years and years ago. They can do seafood well.  Another time the 'fresh' fish of the day seemed old and frozen - my guest was from the port town of Hamburg famed for great fish mongers so even being a Toronto dweller I was cringing! Regardless of low quality it was priced very high. It was priced like a premium dinner course but was just poor, especially the dry fish. They forgot to bring the mentioned potatoes with our tiny portions of fish and veg and when we we inquired they brought us one halved tiny red potato, each. Again... a German diner who knows fish AND potatoes. Should have seen her face! We left paying nearly a ninety bucks for a desperately unfulfilling meal + glass of mediocre Ontario Pinot Noir. I was so embarrassed.  The previous visit I had brought this same guest we had fantastic pasta plates with loads of fresh seafood and vegetables, a beautiful lunch. So I don't trust the unpredictable quality control of this place. You won't know what you're getting and they act like that should be acceptable, when really it's contempt for customers.  During the above-mentioned lunch visit the server was snarky and deliberately evasive. My guest had a plane to catch and our irrational server left us wasting time without menus for a good 20 minutes which seems entirely unsympathetic to customers. At least the food was memorable that time before my guest's flight home."}
{"text":"Located at the edge of the upper beaches, this hidden gem offers large portions of quality food for a very fair price. Always busy though with limited seating. Go at the start of service times. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Lots of things to like about this place: --pleasant servers --good prices --good cooking, from scratch, as it is in Italy: no heat and serve! --pretty genuine Italian, prepared by Sri Lanka chefs with some spice --well-priced wine, though slim choice An example of being genuinely Italian -- especially the Turin area, which I know best -- is lots of vegetables, really nicely prepared, but very few salad dishes. Salad ingredients are not something to be \"over and done with; let's get on to the meat and potatoes.\" They are in every course."}
{"text":"worst sense of common sense in this place. were a group of 4, having to wait 30 minutes to get a table. seeing 3 groups of twos go after us, it was simply horrible. why dont they just regroup us into two tables?! rude staff, unaccomadating, didnt even offer us a menu when we did get a table. the food didnt taste as good as it should be because of the impression that they set upon us."}
{"text":"Ordered food through UberEats. It's  $1 extra to have toast with the breakfast. Ordered 2 omelettes and the Cajun shrimp Caesar salad. Asked for butter and jam on the side for toast. Also requested to have the cooked Cajun shrimp to be packaged separately from the salad as it will wilt the lettuce and will be eating it for lunch, not right away. I didn't get any toast, butter or jam with my order, even though I was charged for it. They also didn't separate the cooked shrimp as requested. It isn't a big deal breaker but would like to get what I paid for and ordered. I had the omelette with mushroom and bacon, it was very bland, overdone, but barely warm. I would still like to try their pastas but they're a bit pricey. Would never order anything but dinner and to dine in only."}
{"text":"After many more meals since my original review, it's time to revisit my rating. I'm bumping it up to 5 stars, 'cause really, how many restaurants do all meals well? Today's breakfast of wild blueberry pancakes with caramelized apples, and real maple syrup, put me over the edge. It was fantastic. It comes with bacon and sausage, which they were happy to substitute with scrambled eggs for me. The orders in my group were equally happy with their meals. This place is a gem in the middle of a neighbourhood not known for it's restaurants."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch before the drive home. Well, was a little disappointed.  Not that the food was bad per say or the service was off but would have appreciated the heads up that the Steak and Eggs Brunch Special was 2x the price of most of the breakfast entree's. Steak and Potatoes were good, service was on top of things despite the fact the service was a \"man\" down due to a tardy server. My beef's... the eggs were small, \"Up\" means \"Up\" not one Up one Fried, and the bill big.   If you are going to have an overly expensive \"special\" let the patrons know it is going to be so much more and make sure it is made exactly to order.   Hope to stop in again and revise my opinion as I have heard great things about the place."}
{"text":"I don't know why this wonderful place has such a low amount of reviews! It is great place for breakfast/brunch by the beaches. Portions are huge and the food is fantastic! And believe me, you will eat all the dish, just see my photos! Yummy!   My hub had special french toast and I went with classic weekender. All the food was great! Staff was very friendly, accommodating, and fast enough. Be ready for waiting in line after 10 a.m. as everybody who lives in Beaches knows this place! Definitely must-have! I'm lovin' it!"}
{"text":"Well that was an unexpected one...my wife and I were on the lookout for something close to home and as the beaches area is plastered with a few gems, a couple of let-downs and lots of mediocrity in between, we decided to go to the east limit of beaches/victoria park on QueenSt.  The appearance was actually quite cute. It's not as wide as it is long, has a cute 10 people patio which is probably busy during summer months and going inside a down-key and appropriate interior deco. Not that I'm a big fan of Americana in general but a few Elvis & Co. oil paintings against Venetian wallpaper really don't bother me. It feels like something bistroish somewhere in Hell's Kitchen with a bit of tack, a bit of whack and lots of people.   It actually was busy here on a Tuesday evening. I like that, so many couldn't be wrong - or could they??  We sat in the back corner and got service immediately, which was a pleasant surprise. Menu is very very pasta heavy, but that is not a bad thing here as it turns out. Instant bread and reduced balsamic which had an unusual earthy molasses-like taste mixed with light olive oil. Interesting. Bread was a type of blandish corn-bread which pretended to be home baked but probably wasn't. Not my fav but still a nice start. For heaven's sake guys, lose those tacky little plastic butter tublets and get someone to cut some chilled churned butter bits on ice water. After all, Vivetha, you are sophisticated and proud, aren't you?   I ordered the Indian King: Penne with wild mushrooms, roasted peppers, carrots, baby spinach & fresh tomatoes in a Madras curry coconut cream sauce with added chicken. At $15 a upper-average bistro price.  It came, saw and won. I mean, the flavors worked extremely well together and I got a taste of dry white in a blend of cream, veggie stock and creme fraiche with fresh garlic and herbs. Hmmmm. Delightful albeit a tad on the filling side. I'm impressed.   Wifey ate Seafood Delight, Linguini with roasted garlic, jumbo sea scallops, shrimp, smoked salmon, spinach & fresh tomatoes. Her smile revealed she liked it also. The pasta in both dishes was cooked just right, to an al-dente stage and the dish was seasoned perfectly. Nice wine list available also. Ok Ramsay, but what was wrong still?  Let me tell you what was \"wrong\" if you can even say it at honest four star rating. What this Bistro needs to earn five stars from me is loosen up the pasta-mania with some fast fried steaks, scallopini or just something a bit more inventive and up-beat. Serve Salads table-side, or put some fancy fish on the menu. God knows what. Ask the servers to be a tad less forward on the sales-pitch. Get rid of anything plasticky like the plastic menus and plastic little gimmicks, including the \"customer satisfaction cards\" you're better than that.  And if you really, really want to push it for five stars, definitely consider serving FRESH PASTA instead of premium durum, which isn't bad, just not the real deal.   Overall a great experience and I will return for sure. Please don't become a second ILL-Fornello though. It would destroy what you are trying so desperately to build - client trust and happy punters.  ****1/4"}
{"text":"One of my favourite brunch spots. I love the fresh fruit and always a big portion of food on the plate ! My servers name was Stephanie and she was so pleasant and a great server! Helped me with what to decide on getting and always tentative to me and my friends.  Great service really makes the whole experience!"}
{"text":"This place was good. I got the French toast with peaches and pecans. It was good, but I wouldn't say it was anything amazing. Probably won't make my way back here but it wasn't bad, just perfectly average."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the salmon!!   Been to this place about 5 times now. The Roasted Garlic Pepper Crusted Salmon ($16) is absolutely to die for! It is served with apple mango strawberry chutney and seasonal veggies... I'm drooling just thinking about it.  I've also ordered the Mussels Gorgonola ($11), which is an appetizer, and was pleasantly surprised with the HUGE amount of mussels included in the order! I had trouble finishing my main dish... but the mussels with bacon, leeks & sweet peppers in a chardonnay Gorgonzola cream sauce is so delicious.   Overall the service is very good - all the staff are pleasant and offer good suggestions on wine selection.   AND for the price of the meals it is so worth what you get! You can always check them out on a Tuesday for their prix fixe menu and they have take out options as well. Definitely make a reservation if you're planning to head over for dinner though as they can get pretty busy!"}
{"text":"Vivetha is a great little spot by the beaches that I frequently go to for breakfast! Their service is a1! They always go above and beyond to make sure my meal is perfect. I've accidentally ordered the wrong meal and they've completely changed it for me free of charge. Today I ordered a smoked salmon salad and I was so tired I completely forgot smoked salmon is raw!!! I ate the salad and left the salmon and at the end the server politely noticed I didn't eat the salmon and offered to cook it for Me!!! She brought it back cooked AND with more salad free of charge! The chefs are fantastic the food always tastes perfect. I love this spot so much  Do yourself a favor and go visit!!!! (They're mainly known for their extensive pasta menu! They have TWOOO FULL pages of pastas to choose from in their menu) Pictured below is the Indian king pasta, and the smoked salmon salad- as well as the complementary bread, balsamic and oil they start you off with."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I came back to this place tonight.  I know the food is mediocre at best.  And Paul's Spaghetti house - where the food so much better - isn't any further from my house.  I guess I like this little neighbourhood and the patio.    Three plates of pasta of differing descriptions, yet somehow, all of them in an unattractive brown colour.  Seafood on the pasta was a nice portion size, but terribly overcooked.  Salads were similar - a wild mushroom salad had a great portion of mushrooms in it, but the dressing was the same balsamic reduction that comes with the bread.  These guys could probably spend a bit less on ingredients if they were better at cooking.    I overheard other diners that were very pleased with their meals and the place was very full.  What is it about this neighbourhood that makes it attract uninspiring restaurants?  Apparently,  if you're a beach resident, you can safely ignore this review and just enjoy the ingredients."}
{"text":"Wonderful!  Amazing food, great service, and very reasonable prices (for the Beach).  It's worth the trip east."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite Beaches brunch spot. I almost always get the potato pancakes, which magnificently come with sausage AND bacon. It never disappoints.  Amazing and fast service. Quaint bistro atmosphere. Extremely reasonable prices.   Definitely worth trekking out to this end of Queen Street for!"}
{"text":"Great little Italian place : pasta.  Reasonable prices. Love how they serve bread with cream of balsamic (my fav). Word of note this place is always packed so it's safest to make reservations come dinner time.  Bonus: Cute little patio in front overlooking Queen street"}
{"text":"Pasta Beach  Had dinner with a friend last week.  We arrived for an early dinner (5:00 ish) and took a side table inside.  The wine by the glass list was meh, in that the selections were dull, pedestrian entries, but the pricing and volume served were quite good and unexpected.  Nice surprise.  I asked for a small garden salad with a simple bit of oil and vinegar, not from the menu, and what I was served was good.  Good balance of oil and acid.  Only thing odd was LOTS of julienned bits of citrus peel. I mean, like, all the garnish for the seafood for the week kind of amount.  Kind of annoying to move them out of the way, but once I did the salad was good.  We each had a main course and nothing else.  Deciding on the \"specials\" was easy, as they were an amalgam of other dishes on the menu, just a few ingredients rotated to sort of come up with something different. Blah.  Bread was kind of a sorry affair.  Still not sure what it was, but it wasn't good.  I wasn't in the mood for pasta, but when I saw the menu, I realized this is what they do.  So pasta it was.  I had Seafood Delight, I believe, with scallops, smoked salmon, shrimp, garlic.  Spaghetti I think was the noodle, and I opted for the white wine sauce, as opposed to the red.  It was good. Probably something along the lines of what I might whip up in 20 mins at home during the week.  Simple but good.  If I had any expectations going into this place beforehand, I might have been mildly disappointed.    My friend (who suggested this place, as it was close by) ordered  a pepper crusted salmon. The fish was a very average quality piece of fish, and cooked OK, not succulent, but not dry.  Was most likely frozen originally, so...  but the vegetables that came with it made the dish worthwhile.  They were well seasoned, not over-done, and a generous portion. Probably the best part of the meal.  Sum:  I wouldn't drive out here to eat from another part of town, but if you're nearby, by all means go.  When the check came I actually had reverse sticker shock.  It was less that I had expected!  So for this I'm being generous and giving it 4 stars.  This is an inflated rating.  It is because the prices are more than fair for what you get, not because this is 4 star food or service.  Make sense?  Cin cin!"}
{"text":"I went with a friend for brunch who is a regular here. First thing she advised was to go with the brunch specials and not bother with the regular offerings. I did what she suggested and we both ended up ordering a smoked salmon eggs Benny. It was a decent preparation and the portion size was good, if that is important to you. Service was good but the food was a little slow to come out and was just ok. I would not rush back to this place, only if I lack imagination while in that area of the Beach."}
{"text":"The bruch here is amazing.  The prices are great and you get a whole plate of delicious and healthy food.  I like the eggs benedict and eggs vivetha.  The coffee is good quality and the waitstaff are very quick and attentive."}
{"text":"We went for a family dinner the other night and we a had a really good time. Service was slower then what we are used however and the waitstaff could be a bit more attentive... If there were more staff members working. I order the medallions. My meal was cooked perfectly and they were kind enough to give me extras (sauce, lemons etc).  Prices are a tad higher then other places in the area however well worth it as the portion sizes and food quality are amazing."}
{"text":"This is a great place to take your family and friends!  The breakfast is yummy, I like the eggs benedict with fried tomatoes, salad, fruit and home fries!   You can get seafood omelets on special days.  I took my friend for dinner there who was visiting from the west coast of Canada.  She loved it as they served these huge scallops and she couldn't them on the west coast, I felt good I took her there.   Great place and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"A lovely neighbourhood restaurant with a great brunch - I love the Sante Fe Omelette with salad, fruit and homefries - all for only $8 ."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the place. This was my first time in the neighborhood. The inside of this place was comfortable and welcoming. The staff was nice and friendly. The food for brunch is good. The portion size is big.  However, I would have to say the food option is what most brunch places tend to offer.  This place is very busy but I have yo say the staff tend to be forgetful. We asked for coffee three times before they came back to refill our coffee. It was the same when we asked for a take out box,  we had to asked three times, each time a different server before we got the take out box. I might come back if I was in the area. This place I would say is average."}
{"text":"I've been here ALOT. I used to be in love with this place.  They do a great breakfast for cheap. ($7) that includes, eggs, sausage, bacon, toast and fruit.  I really enjoy the tri colour tortellini and the angry chicken.  However, I did get a big black hair tightly wrapped around my pasta last time I was there. I just can't go back now.   The staff here are quite rude, that's the big thing that let's this place down.  It is a cute little premises right on the end of Queen St E (by Vic Park) and the food is good but the people they hire just are not friendly to customers.  It is always very busy but it's still inexcusable.  If you're in this area (I live here btw) there are so many great little restaurants where they are very welcoming. I'd give this a miss tbh."}
{"text":"I only ate at this place one time but heard nothing but great things about it so when I was visiting friends in the neighbour hood we decided to order takeout from them.   The place itself is small, nessled at the very end of Queen st east... it's a cozy little bistro with a quaint patio that fills up fast with regulars who love the delicious italian inspired cuisine. They offer reasonably healthy options and some fairly hefty portions but the price point is rather high considering they are not a bistro downtown with $16 + plates they really should be doing something to make it a little more reasonable.  But I will say the food was excellent, I ordered the wild mushroom chicken entree and my friend ordered the tri colored tortellini and both were absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. I myself prefered her dish as it tasted authentically italian and very rich but my chicken dish was well done, served with perfectly grilled asparagas, eggplant and sweet potato a dish I would certainly order again. The service was fairly pleasant and fast I cannot comment much as we were only grabbing takeout but they were prompt in dealing with us and amiable as well.   I have been told they also serve a delectable brunch menu that is only available between certain times but apparently it is something special...  Parking once again is a bit tricky here and it all depends on the time of day and which day of the week... toronto can be so bad for parking but if you can grab a spot on a side street like Neville Park Blvd you should have 3 good hrs to park free from worries and within walking distance of the restaurant.  Definitely a cozy little bistro I would recommend to anyone nearby who's looking for a good italian inspired meal"}
{"text":"Had their Eggs Benedict ($9) and I was pleasantly surprised. The staff is good; the food was amazing. The salad dressing and potatoes that came with it were equally delicious. Looking forward to going back to try their other breakfast items. Easy to get there on the Queen street car, get down at the last stop at Neville park."}
{"text":"For brunch this restaurant is great. Big portion and reasonable prices but could serve better coffee. I have been going there for years. So far I have not been disappointed yet. There are some hiccups but minor and they try to fix it."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a whim because we dropped off our puppy for a grooming appt a few doors down. We walked in on a Sunday at 11am. We were immediately greeted and seated. I ordered the classic weekender ($13) that had eggs bene with smoked salmon, side salad, home fries, fruit, a slice of avocado and Brie. My husband got the special grand Marinier infused French toast ($14) that came with sausage and bacon (plus he got a side of home fries ($2.50) & coffee($2)). Service was very fast. Server was quite attentive to water and coffee refills. Portion was huge. The only downside was that I felt guilty not being able to finish everything! We were in and out within 35 minutes!"}
{"text":"If I have to get asked one.. more.. time.. if I have a reservation when the place is empty...  Then :-\   One has to wonder what the real deal is when the place is empty and you get asked if you have a reservation.  And not only do they do that,  but explain to you that every table in the house is reserved and that they guess they can give you this crappy table over here but you only have 35 minutes to eat and get out. Like really?! That's no way to treat a customer. This is not the first time this has happened here. Then one has to wonder why SOME people of a certain NON colour.. don't have a reservation and get seated no problem and don't get the same shpeel I did. Hrmmmm... :-/  As for the service it takes forever and a day to get anything if the waitresses aren't busy ignoring you or chatting it up near the bar.  The food takes forever to come and so does the free bread..  And it's FREE!   The food itself is.. Ok. I find it overcooked and too oily for my taste.    Take a note from your other location on Yonge Street.  When a paying customer comes in and your place is empty, you say how many and pleasantly seat and serve them.. Not make them feel like they ain't shit and they should be lucky to get a crappy table and have to get out in half hour and then don't bring their food for an hour.  THAT is bad bad customer service and terrible business."}
{"text":"What a quaint little place. I have been several times and each is better then the last. The prices are reason enough to go! You must stop one night when your parents stop by and want to pay for dinner...gotta leave something in the estate, yet please their taste buds."}
{"text":"Love this place! Portions are huge, prices reasonable, and the food is really good! Staff is also very friendly and you always feel welcome. I love the food so much, sometimes I get take out just because it is such a treat and I crave their delicious pasta! Can't go wrong with Angry Salmon. I've tried several pasta dishes and they were all amazing! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I avoided this restaurant for months because I was expecting another overpriced Italian Bistro, but was pleasantly surprised after going for lunch and discovering  that the prices were very good (and downright great based on the quantity of food you get).  Have returned several times and when they are busy the service can feel a little rushed and once or twice had visits where the server was a little slower than I would have liked bringing the bill or menu.  The brunch menu is what I usually end up ordering from.  The French toast is out of this world and the standard egg/bacon/home fries combos are hearty and delicious.  The fresh fruit with your meal is a nice touch, as is the basket of every jam you could want if your order comes with toast."}
{"text":"I can't believe the low rating of this place. I've been many times and it's always great. Friendly service, good portions, great prices and the food is always made fresh.  It gets insanely busy on the weekend for brunch, which is why I think some ppl have given a low rating. It's a diner, not a fancy restaurant ppl! Of the other brunch spots I've tried in the beaches I always come back to ViVetha."}
{"text":"If you live in the beach, Vivetha is that restaurant that the locals have been raving about for a few years.  As a beacher, I was late to the party going there only last year for the first time...it's at the very east end on Queen which is like going to the moon for most people and also feels like a time warp with the hodge podge of shops and dodgey looking laundromats. I thought it was going to look more homey, but the decor like they got a deal on the remnants of a Moxie's or some other chain. Also I don't really like massive menus where there are 12 types of pasta.  When did this happen anyway?  When I was young, we had spaghetti and fat spaghetti, then came angel hair spaghetti and all hell broke loose. The food is consistently been good (been there 3 times now) but yes!  Humungous portions which they can't change now because they set a precedent.  If you are thinking of starting a restaurant, don't do this.  Heaps of food is a turn off because you end up feeling bad when you don't eat the salad. The best part of Vivetha is that if you are a local, you will always run into someone you know and it's almost always somebody who is having an affair."}
{"text":"A lovely intimate place with great service, good portions and delicious choices.  We have been here for both brunch and dinner.  It has been consistently great.  The seafood pasta dishes are my favorite.  This was one of the first restaurants we went to as a couple and it was wonderful.  Even on a rainy day, the food and atmosphere was great.  So glad a friend recommended it to us!"}
{"text":"I have never been more east than this, other than when driving on the 401 to get the fuck out of the city for a weekend. This is about as far as you can go along Queen Street East before Scarborough.   My meal was absolutely five stars. If you can avoid the server that I had on my first visit (embarrassingly, I think it was the owner), it's well worth the trek to The Beach(es). Before dinner make sure you get a cupcake at Life Is Sweet: A Cupcake House (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/life-is-sweet-a-cupcake-house-toronto#hrid:9TAPc-LI-PW-1Ccn1XLrWg) across the street, cause they close early. Best cupcake in the city.  ANYHOODLE.  I read about this place on a Chowhound thread called \"I Defy You To Name Me A Single Decent Restaurant Worth Travelling To The Beaches For\" (or something to that effect). It was one of the only places that seemed quasi-appealing after reading through all the comments. We made a reservation for two people without any trouble and trekked east to check it out. Yelper shoutout: spotted Abby R there on the same night! The restaurant is very poorly lit - like, beyond \"Can't-Read-Your-Menu\" dark and graduated to \"Can't-Take-A-Decent-Photo-For-Yelp\" dark. I couldn't take an adequate photo of the interior or exterior.  As for the food:  Butternut Squash Soup ($4). Bacon wasn't listed on the menu, but the otherwise vegetarian soup came with bits of it as a garnish. I returned the soup to the kitchen (with much difficulty) and got Grana Padano as a garnish instead. Very, very velvety and rich - I would definitely order this again.   Angry Salmon ($16). This was incredible. Just absolutely perfect. I want to eat this again RIGHT NOW. The portion of fish was ENORMOUS - I hungrily mowed through half of the meal and there was enough left over for the next day's dinner. The fish fillets were seasoned with a zesty cajun spice rub (HOT!) and cooked properly throughout. This was all on top of a bed of spaghetti in cream sauce with artichokes, baby spinach and tomatoes. The sauce was...every clichéd adjective used to describe delicious food. I fell in love with it.  I don't want to harp too much on the service but this was one of the few times I have left absolutely no tip. The service was awful. There wasn't any particularly egregious exchange that night, but the server (the owner or manager) was inattentive, forgetful and well...just not good at her job. I endured a bit of ball-busting about the unadvertised bacon in the soup, we had to ask for water three separate times (to the point that we had stop eating because we couldn't swallow any more food without fluids), and the only visits she made to our table were for the delivery of food and the bill.  I get that the dining room was full/busy but it was a weeknight and it seemed to be the norm for Vivetha from what I read in other testimonials. Perhaps she was having a bad day but honestly, it was a real turnoff. Luckily the food was excellent enough for me to want to come back...I'm just not rushing to do so. I really hope this was an anomaly because it was a terrible first impression to make.  Reservations are highly recommended."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience here. The pastas were great, the bruschetta we shared as an appetizer was delicious, the wine list was reasonably diverse and not unreasonably priced, and our server was personable and attentive and happy to share her opinions and advice. (I love wait staff that doesn't try to tell you that absolutely everything on the menu is equally good.)  That said, I'm not guaranteeing you our experience.  We watched another waitress on duty in action. Suffice it to say that a couple of stars would have been lost here - though it was somewhat entertaining to observe from a distance..."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely amazing but the food was mediocre at best. It's not super expensive but it's also not cheap. I ordered the seafood pasta and ate half of it because it was over cooked. They asked what I thought. I told them. They tried to offer me dessert which was great but at the end of the day, I was here for the main course and it simply wasn't good. I don't know how this place got 4 stars."}
