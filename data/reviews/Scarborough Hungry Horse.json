{"text":"Recently had the curry and pint deal... what a mistake !
Strangest tasting korma ever... 
Interior decor was rough, carpets sticking up, holes in the chair, table just about to collapse, loud crappy music.
The worst place i have ever been in the last 5 years, give it a miss and if youre desperate go to mucky macs opposite !"}
{"text":"Won't be going here again. Ordered an all day breakfast, waited 40 minutes, when it arrived it was cold. Sent it back, staff weren't happy. Breakfast arrived again, sausage and bacon were almost burnt..left most of it. No apology and no refund offered. Maybe they were having a bad day, I don't know but won't be stopping off there again in a hurry."}
{"text":"Having single out the Scarborough Hungry Horse as a good place to go for what I thought would be a good Birthday Meal.
You can not imagine my horror, to arrive home from the said Restaurant, only to find that one of the members of my party was very, very ill after eating there.
Not being a local, I emailed the Managers, Twice, but got no reply.....
So I contacted their Head Office, only to be passed from one person to another.
And the Bottom line, they are / were not interested in what had happened, not one word of SORRY!
So be careful if you go to a Hungry Horse, your probably eating it."}
{"text":"I have been a regular here for quite a while as I love the burgers.


 I must admit it is a bit hit and miss some times, but the burgers are always nice.


 The service varies, sometimes its realy slow and I mean slow but the staff are always friendly and I have never had a problem with the food."}
