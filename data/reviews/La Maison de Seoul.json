{"text":"The value for money you get is really good. The food is flavorful and  never to spicy. The hot stone bibenbop is my favorite. I've got here a couple times. Bring some soup oratoire own wine it will make it an even better experience. (: the service is super friendly to."}
{"text":"The taste of the food, the service and cleanliness of the place are great and deserve 4-5 stars. Ok, they won't win any design awards as the atmosphere was pretty typical for an Asian restaurant. However, the food was so delicious that my husband and I went back 3 times. Alas, the last time, which was a few days ago, I've had the 3rd bad reaction in this restaurant from eating the same dish. All within the span of 6 months since we discovered this restaurant. I'm strongly suspecting that the sauce for their very well done \"Dolsot Bibimbap\" (my favourit dish) contains MSG. Within 15 min. after all 3 of those visits since last year I've had MAJOR issues to the degree that I could barely walk and became panicky from how the cholic in my intestines literally paralyzed me. The reaction was so bad that we had to cut our daytrip to Montreal short and return home earlier. I've had nothing but major discomfort day and night since this meal 4 days ago. Whatever is in their yummy spicy Bibimbap sauce it's not worth this kind of damage to my digestive system. It's not fair to withhold this information from customers and make people suffer like this when the sauce would probably taste just fine without this added garbage in it ......"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been talking about trying this place for a while, having walked by it a number of times. We finally had a chance to go last night with some friends who had recommended it. We were 6 and got seated fairly quickly. It took a little longer than expected for us to place our order with the server but once we did the food started flowing!  Everyone with the exception of myself ordered the Korean BBQ , which didn't disappoint! It came with an individual salad for everyone, all you can eat kimchi, pickled potatoes, slaw and another marinated vegetable. My boyfriend really enjoyed the chicken Korean BBQ option, mentioning it was his favorite out of the other options (pork , beef etc) . For our appetizers we ordered the vegetable pancake (9 pieces ) and 4 pieces of vegetable tempura. We greatly enjoyed both as they were fresh and tasty, however I would caution against  each ordering separate dishes for your main as it's just way too much food. Better option would be to order another dish to share. I had the udon noodle soup  with boiled tofu. The broth was soft with a hint of flavour. I really enjoyed it. Overall the experience was great considering the price and that's it's BYOW. Will definitely go again and further explore the menu!"}
{"text":"This quaint little place is an authentic homestyle Korean restaurant located near Vendome. It's not in the most convenient of neighborhoods but if you have the time do try it out.

To start off, their side dishes are especially delicious. I'm a big fan of the sweet potatoes and the kimchi. As for the main dishes the hot pot bibimbap is what they are known for. It costs a few dollars more than the normal bibimbap, but it's also that much better. The rice comes crisp on the side surrounding a bed of fresh vegetables topped with an egg. Very filling.

The restaurant is a little quiet but the staff is very nice and helpful when you talk to them. The prices are also very fair."}
{"text":"Extremely reasonably priced!

I ordered one of the main dishes thinking, at $11, it would make a light dinner. Since I was hungry I thought I'd better order an appetizer - shrimp & vegetable tempura ( a weakness).

The waitress brought me a salad, then a soup, then my appetizer and then, once I was done, four side dishes to go with the meal...followed by the meal. I ate too much - for under $20 for dinner. Outstanding (the price not eating too much)!

It's authentic Korean and both the waitress and the man I took to be the owner or manager were very polite and helpful."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place doesn't have more 5-star reviews, given that the content of all the other reviews is stating how amazing this place is.

When you order a main dish, they first start you off with a salad (iceberg lettuce, but the dressing is delicious!), followed by miso soup (with tofu, and what appears to be spinach), followed by three side dishes (a marinated potato dish, a spicy kale dish, and kimchee...I might be forgetting a fourth!). By the time my main course comes, I'm never that hungry (and the main courses are HUGE!) but somehow always seem to manage.

The only drawback I found to this place is that the kimchee is really salty. But that's not enough to take off a star, and the rest of the food is amazing.  

I've been here twice so far, but haven't made it past the beef hot bowls to try something else. I will next time!  The first time I came, the place was slammed but the waiters were so friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Really nice staff good quality for basic dishes. 

 Calorie counters will find stuff on menu such as soft tofu soup. 

Wasn't a fan of the BBQ but seems popular 

Their bibimpbaps are really good

BYOB

GO here"}
{"text":"Super sympa: les serveurs/euses sont gentils et attentionnés, la bouffe est succulente et variées, les portions sont vraiment généreuses, particulièrement compte tenu du prix, et toutes les petites entrées qui viennent avec sont délicieuses. Il y a une petite terrasse, et c'est un apportez votre vin. Vraiment ce resto a tout pour lui. SI vous êtes dans le quartier allez y faire un tour!
Pour les non-initiés je conseille le dolsot bibimbap, ou, si vous aimez les fèves noires ou êtes végétarien/ne, le young yang dolsotbap, tous deux cuits et servis dans un bol en pierre chaude (d'où \"dolsot\"), des délices!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Been there a few times and will continue to make this our go-to place for Korean. The exterior is a bit deceiving as it doesnt look like much from the outside but it's a little gem in Westmount.

Good service, great food, large portions, cheap and it's BYOB!

Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this for a long time and learned online that they had a full bar- once seated we realised that it was bring your own wine- that was a bummer,
The plates we ordered were ok, and we got loads of appetizers included in our meal that tasted great. The ambience is very quiet and familial."}
{"text":"Lately I've been craving good Korean food like crazy. After trying a few places around the city, including Kantapia and Ganadara, this is definitely my fav. 

Don't be turned off by the less than inspiring facade or the broken door. The warm interior and delicious food more than make up for it. 

My top suggestions are the Bibimbap, the seafood pancake and the BBQ grill. I've also heard the soups are amazing as is the japche noodles, but I haven't tried these first hand. 

Let's start with the Dolson Bibimbap - Bibimbap served in a piping hot ceramic bowl with rice, veg, meat and egg. The flavours are perfectly balanced and completely delicious. The portion is huge, so you likely won't be able to finish it all, but man will you want to! 

The seafood pancake is also a must. Packed with flavour, this entre is best to share. 

If you opt for the Korean BBQ, you better come
hungry! This is served on a grill right at the table, and must be for a minimum of 2 people. You get everything including meat, mushrooms, garlic, onions, fresh lettuce, a rice bowl and more. This is a truly delicious option, but be warned, you'll leave here smelling like grilled meat."}
{"text":"Only place in Montreal I found that does hwe dup bap and they do it very well too! Could be more generous with the pan chan but overall quite good - we shared a main dish - was enough for lunch!"}
{"text":"I went this restaurant once, and that was the last. One of the dishes I ordered that day was Korean pancake. I did not get it for 40 minutes. When I finally got the Korean pancake, the whole bottom of the dish was burnt charcoal-black. I demanded a new Korean pancake, which took 20 minutes. The new one tasted a greasy chunk of potato with no crispiness. Other dishes I tried were all below my expectation for the price I was paying."}
{"text":"Trip 4
A small family run Korean restaurant in Westmount. Clean with friendly service. Started with a typical lettuce salad with Wafu-like dressing and a small bowl of miso soup with spinach and tofu. We had four side dishes inclusing kimchi, lettuce kimchi, coleslaw and soy sauce potatoes. Not the most amazing side dishes. We had a small seafood pancake which they burned but was quite tasty. If only it wasn't burnt, it would have been amazing. We ordered the bibimbap and the beef stir fry with rice. Very generous portions. The beef stir was bland with poor presentation. The bibimbap was quite well done with all the toppings of what you'd expect. One question I have is why they don't have Pork Backbone soup?

Overall it was a typical Korean restaurant without any frills or special dishes."}
{"text":"Korean cuisine is absolutely epic! Epic flavours and epic presentations ... of epic proportions. This is an ancient and time tested to perfection sort of cooking. 

As a vegetarian dining at a Korean BBQ joint I am always thankful when I leave stuffed, satiated and pleased beyond belief.

A brief tutorial: Panch'an is the general umbrella term that refers to the small side dishes that are served with any Korean meal. Kimchi is an integral part of the dining experience as it damn well should be. Kimchi is oh so good! Who knew cabbage could be so interesting? Namul falls under the category of panch'an but consists of those side dishes that involve vegetables. They are absolutely delicious. The simplicity, subtlety and diversity of flavours hints at the unique and ancient quality of these recipes. My favourite namul is the kongnamul which is a beautiful bean sprout marinated in sesame oil and rice wine vinegar with black pepper. Musaengchae is chicory tossed in a savoury hot pepper and sesame. Gogumasum is boiled potato in a light sweet vinegar. Oi sobagi are these delicious seasoned cucumbers. Mmm my mouth is watering just at the thought of them. They come complimentary with your meal and traditionally are unlimited ... so unbuckle that belt and prepare to feast! 

If you want to stay for a main dish and not just dine and dash on excellent and free side dishes then you really must order the vegetarian dolsot bibimbap! This is the archetype of warming and scrumptious down home comfort food. It's a hot stone bowl that cooks your meal right in front of your eyes. Imagine a perfectly cooked bed of wild rice; soft yet crisp on the edges. Then all the vegetables you could imagine piled sky high then topped with an egg like a cherry on top. Add your Korean hot sauce to taste and / or the especially burn-your-mouth-off pepper concoction which they make just for themselves and yours truly. Mix it up and let it cook as you eat and enjoy!

Get the ginseng tea with the deep fried green tea ice cream afterwards. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Seafood pancake, tofu soup were great, bulgogi and kimchi side dishes were ok, not remarkable. Please note I am not a food snob, but I do live in New York City where the large Korean population demands authentic Korean cuisine, and I noticed the difference. Perhaps it's the French-Canadian influence? a bit saltier than what I am used to, and ... capers on stir fry? don't get me wrong, I love capers & enjoyed the flavor, it's just not very Korean.

Finally, the place does need an interior design face lift - if nothing else, please do something with the bare walls of the corner bar, it will lift the ambiance considerably!"}
{"text":"I must say the service in this place is outstanding. Our waitress was super attentive and friendly. She always came to our table with a big smile on her face. Even if a plate was done with, she still asked if it could be removed from the table. There's a lovely terrace outside where you could enjoy your meal and people watch. 

The only downside was the actual food. It was ok. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't extraordinary either. My bimbimbap was served as a cold salad dish. I thought it would have been served in a hot plate to warm up. My boyfriend order the seafood plate which was very generous. They weren't skimpy on the fish. 

Overall not bad. I would eat here again if I was desperate but not a place I'm dying to go back too."}
{"text":"I have not, at any time, been indisposed of objectionable experiences in any korean establishment in Montreal. Thus, I hold dearly the same prejudice toward this restaurant. Generous with Panch'an, they will fill them up throughout your meal. Kind gesture."}
{"text":"We waited 30 mins to be seated without a reservation on a Saturday evening as a group of 3 but on weeknights there isn't much of a wait. I've tried the mandu veg dumplings, the cripsy veg croquettes, the dumpling soup, and the beef dolsot bibimbap, the shrimp dolsot bibimbap.... The dolsot bibimbap comes in a hot stone bowl and continues cooking as you eat so it's delicious. Plenty of vegetables and meat, and quite filling so I took 1/2 to go. It's a very simple restaurant with efficient service. They bring you all-you-can-eat small appetizers in the beginning (kimchi, coleslaw, etc). I've been to La Maison de Seoul several times now and think it's a great option for Korean food in the area!"}
{"text":"Nice cozy place, perfect for lunch. The store itself is pretty small and family style. They serve classic Korean dishes like bulgogi. Also I'd say this place is Japanese fusion with dishes like miso soup, unagi don, oyakodon, and bento boxes. 
Service was attentive and friendly, they were consistently refilling our appetizers and water. 

Banchan was ok, there were potatoes, two types of kimchi, and bean sprouts. The soup was miso with spinach I believe. Interesting. We spent some time trying to figure out what green leafy vegetable it was. 
I got a bento box lunch special, which had salad, teriyaki salmon, fried mandu, a spring roll, and cream puffs. The salmon was pretty dry and overcooked. Also I was hoping everything would be made in house but I'm not so sure about the spring roll and cream puffs. A bizzare bento, but I'll take it.
The others in my party got bibimbap. There were lots of mozzarella in them which was pretty cool. They liked it, but hoped the portion size was bigger.

The food wasn't amazing but it was reasonably priced. I'd come here for lunch again because why not."}
{"text":"The service was really nice and friendly,  i took the seafood noodle soup mild with seafood pancake. Seafood pancake was really good, but the noodle soup was unfortunately very bland, no taste. Overall it was a good experience, but if i ever go back i wouldnt take the seafood noodle soup."}
{"text":"I liked the food like kimchi and the other banchans.
I believe It's the best korean restaurant in Montreal island as a korean."}
{"text":"I'll round up to 5 from my score of 4.5. It's BYOB so it gets extra points. 7 of us had 9 bottles and the waitress was kind enough to keep come opening them. She wasn't over the moon that we were still seated 30 minutes after closing but she didn't rush us out so props to her. 4 of us had the BBQ, 2 had soups and I had the appetizer sized Kampungi (essentially it's like general Tao but more delicious) rice and spring rolls. One of the soups was still boiling on the table ten minutes later. Fresh and delicious Kimchi, we never figured out what that potato salad was all about. Shrimp and chicken dumplings were also delightful. Only negative points are that the dishes on the table weren't cleared off timely at all, water glasses weren't filled once past the initial welcome.  Great location and balanced quality for a fair price, add in BYOB with no corking fee and you have a winner."}
{"text":"Authentic Korean restaurant, recommend by my Korean friends. I like the way they serve rice in a thick-wall hot stone bowl."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and it's one of my favourite Korean restaurants. The food is always so good and consistent. The people who work here are also great and so welcoming"}
{"text":"I have tried Korean around the city and I really prefer the BBQ grill here than anywhere else. The family run place is very good and not overly fancy. It is a nice and inexpensive option of this area of Westmount. My good friend took me here about 7 years ago and I've been coming every since. By far one of the few places on this strip that I would go to for dinner."}
{"text":"While it doesn't look like much from the outside (and even from the inside!), La Maison de Seoul is a fantastic place for korean food. The korean BBQ (only available for two people or more) is amazing and you get a lot of food for your money. It's a very quiet place and it's a BYOW which makes it perfect for a date."}
{"text":"Attentive and friendly service. Quick food service. Decent menu selection. Delicious and authentic food. Good prices and portion sizes. Warm ambiance. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We love this little local place. Homestyle Korean food, friendly service. The kimchi is outstanding and we love the bimbibap."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for a few years now. Whenever i would crave some good Korean, this is the place for me. They serve your typical classic Korean dishes. You know, the ones you find in all the Korean restaurants! I usually order the dolsot bibimbap. It comes sizzling hot in the stone bowl. Their appetizers are quite good especially their seafood pancake. When you order a main, you'll always get some ban-chan (side dishes), a soup and a salad. Nothing fancy but oh so good! The prices are very good ($-$$) and the portions are generous. They used to offer sushis as well but decided to take it off the menu. Too bad because i really enjoyed it. Service is very good but can sometimes be slow, although nothing to fuss over. Ok, so they need to update the decorations...but hey! Food is up to par! It is, after all, a family run establishment. Call to make reservation just in case, especially on Fridays and Saturdays."}
{"text":"Very nice service, they refill the tea and they put vegetables in the middle of the table. The food its just ok for me, nothing amazing exept for the nice smile of the waitress."}
{"text":"I really loved this place. Open late, friendly atmosphere, generous portions of well-made homestyle Korean food. I got the bibimbap (which they make with chicken!), and I was treated to a steaming bowl of fresh veggies and delicious hot sauce."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, I've casually walked by this place probably hundreds of times and have never really thought to go in. The interior doesn't scream exciting but I actually was super impressed.

The food was really tasty, ingredients were fresh and absolutely everyone took home a bunch leftovers (the portions are MASSIVE). While it was not my favourite bibimbap by this city's standards, it definitely was the most bountiful while still quite good. The service was also lovely, and the server was really patient with my brutal indecisiveness.

My mini-qualm with the place is that we could have used about five times as much kimchi on the table but maybe we're just pickled-fare fiends. Oh and it's a bit pricey.

Also, it's BYOB (zero corkage fee!). If you're not familiar with the neighbourhood there's an SAQ about five minutes East by foot on Sherbrooke."}
