{"text":"When we go out to eat, my SO and I like to order different meals so that we can sample a variety of foods from the restaurant. In particular to sushi restaurants, I usually get some raw fish and my SO gets a bento with cooked foods. 

Here at Sushi House, I ordered the salmon chirashi and he got a bento. The bento was not too special but the chirashi was very good. The rice was well seasoned, with a  generous portion of salmon, along with other little condiments on the side like marinated mushrooms and pickled radish. After the first time, I always order the same thing. 

The owners and chef are Korean and so the sushi is a bit different from Japanese or Chinese sushi."}
{"text":"Was really expecting more out of this place. The sushi tastest horrible even for the price and they put the same spicy mayo sauce on all their dishes. Rice on the sushi had a nice temperature but the tuna they used was straight out of a can and cold af which clashed heavily with the sushi.

If you just want to fill yourself up for really cheap then I guess this place is for you. Don't come in expecting tasty sushi tho."}
{"text":"I had a very good AYCE lunch experience. The dollar value I found here cannot be found anywhere else IMHO. The environment is 4.5/5 because many Sushi place is not very clean or looks old, this place is relatively new. Never tried the dinner or a la carte, but again, for 11.99, you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"My husband and i went here for the first time to try a different sushi restaurant.  I found the servers friendly but at times service was slow. The atmosphere was nice and private enough for a dinner date.
We ordered the famous crunchy soup which i thought was ok.  We also ordered a mix of sushi - taste wise it was just ok.  The sushi rolls seem to be filled with more vegetables than meat."}
{"text":"I had to listen to the first 30 seconds of a shakira song, stuck on repeat, for half an hour with the staff seemingly unable to understand why this might be annoying.

This is the first time I've ever felt genuinely tortured by being inside a restaurant."}
{"text":"we went to sushi house because we were craving all you can eat sushi! it was so yummy and we got a bunch of sushi! we love coming here! they have been open for a few years now and they keep growing! my family and i will definitely continue to come here! we also got some dessert, i got the tempura ice cream and let me just say, IT WASSSS AMAZING! so i definitely recommend this place! keep up the good work sushi house employees! continue the great work sushi house employees!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!!! The only sushi spot on the east. I'm so glad i found this place. My new favorite place to come eat sushi"}
{"text":"My personal favourite for all u can eat sushi. Great prices and service. The food here is consistently good and I have never had to wait too long to get a table."}
{"text":"Hi there,

I just ate lunch today for the 4.99 special which I usually order quite often.
I noticed after eating the salmon rolls and chicken rolls that something was not right.
I hope I do not get food poisoning or sick from it. The salmon in the rolls was grey color and the chicken was over cooked like it was sitting out for a while this order.
I am very turned off of this place now and never had an issue."}
{"text":"I had the chicken teriyaki and a friend had vegetable udon soup. I must say the food is very mediocre. Nothing special at all. I did not enjoy my food. After we both ordered and settled down they asked us to move to a table(I found that rude) but also the tables are UNCOMFORTABLY close. Literally a foot between you and the person beside you. Squeezing into the table with someone's butt so close to your food is gross. Not impressed"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and don't come here.
It's nasty. Service is slow and they're rude too. If you complain about the food or ask for your food, they talk back. I don't understand how hard it is to refill my water without waiting 10 minutes when it's not even busy. There's way too much rice on my sushi rolls and the food is burnt..."}
{"text":"Ordered a party platter from sushi house and we throughly enjoyed it! The sushi was super fresh and tasty. Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Woodbine Mall, just inside main food court door on left. This is the best ten dollar meal value I've seen anywhere. \"Bento Box A\" freshly made, generous portions, superb quality. I travel a lot and love sushi; nothing anywhere even come close to this value. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food was alright but server was extremely rude. I would come back for the take out but never again for the sit in. 

The bento box was okay. They would not change the regular salad for a different salad and this is the only place that would not do it for me. It was not good for the service."}
{"text":"This is the ONLY sushi restaurant in Sunrise Manor.  For that, I give it props. I enjoy many of their rolls. Ask for the off-menu items: Fall in Love, Flame, and Gunpowder. I'm a regular. The only gripe I have is they tend to use too much sugar in their sushi rice. As a diabetic, that's a HUGE minus for me."}
{"text":"Like some others on here, I got the Sushi Dinner Combo #10. The crunch soup and salad that they combo came with were both very good; the miso soup, alternatively, was more or less forgettable for me. 

The amount of sushi that you get (20 rolls) for $20 is awesome, especially when you consider that dining out in the GTA is typically quite expensive. All three rolls (spicy tuna, spicy salmon, and their specialty \"dynamite\" roll) were quite good. The fish for the spicy tuna and salmon was very tender, and for lack of better words, \"creamy\"--both were very well executed. Though I am normally a sucker for speciality rolls, and salmon-based sushi, the spicy tuna was my favorite of the three. Even so, the other two rolls were by no means lackluster. 

Whereas cheap sushi may be dime-a-dozen in the GTA, I feel like affordable AND delicious sushi is not. Sushi House is a great little spot in downtown Brampton that meets both criteria. I'll definitely be back, and recommend it if you are in Brampton with a sushi craving!"}
{"text":"This was a horrible place to eat! I took my coworker out for lunch for her birthday and she suggested we go here. We walked in and stood for five minutes waiting to be seated. No one came so we found an empty table and sat ourselves. The waitress came and said \"only 2?\" And took the remaining plates from the table. We then waited another 15 mins while people who came in after us were being served (mostly takeout orders). We were about to leave when someone came to take our order. I did the all you can eat for $11.99. The food came out all at once. The soup wasn't even hot. The edamame was over cooked. I are quite a bit of sushi. When we were finished I asked for the bill. The waiter came and I paid by debit. We tried to tell him that the edamame was over cooked but he didn't understand. Then another waitress came and I told her the issue with the edamame. She then turned around and said I'm going to be charged for the food I left on my plate because I wasted. I told her I already paid. She then came back to me and said next time I shouldn't waste food.  I put all the left over sushi on one plate cause they came out on several different plates to help them with the clean up. I told her I could take it with me if she felt like I was wasting it and she said no I have to pay for it. F$/@ that! I won't be going back again"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi in the city. Always fresh, great service, and prices are reasonable. I love this spot."}
{"text":"Came here because of the Yelp reviews. I was happy that it was quiet and we even had a private area to ourselves. The crispy soup was really good- it was a broth with some noodles and pieces of fried tempura. We got the agadashi tofu as an appetizer and it was AMAZING! Had teriyaki sauce on it- nice sized pieces - loved it! I had the chicken teriyaki dinner and my husband had the salmon sushi dinner. I did not enjoy the chicken as it was poor quality meat. Tasted dry and tough. My husband said his salmon sushi dinner was just alright. I'm glad we tried it out. I would go back but hubby says he wouldn't. Our total bill was about $45 with pop as drinks."}
{"text":"Good Food. Small place but really cool inside. The sushi is great. The lunch special bento box is great meal. 

Can confirm."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! We ordered off of the all you can eat menu. Everytime we ordered, it would take them 45 minutes to prepare and bring to our table. They brought one item at a time and we had to wait another 30-45mins for the next. We ordered salmon and white tuna sashimi. Both were still frozen cold when served. On top of that, staff were unfriendly. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Good food for an AYCE lunch place,  the crispy rolls and hand rolls were nice, but the kitchen was heavy handed with the (non) spicy mayo. Service was disorganized. First for the many 4 person seats (\"you can't sit there,  it's for 4 people!\" Nope. No groups of 4 for the hour,  it was all pairs). Second, our server never (voluntarily) came back to our table after the initial delivery,  we had to flag other staff down to get her because third, 3 servers kept overlapping at the same table behind us. Their table were amused. We weren't. Oh yeah,  and the server (after the last flagdown) also started walking away after handing me the bill and pinpad. She appeared ready to let me punch in my own total, steal the machine or whatever...  Anyway,  decent price, decent food,  1 nice server that we saw, I hope they retrain the others soon. It's worth visiting for lunch."}
{"text":"The is place is great. They are fast at their take out orders and the owners seem like they are very nice people. They are extremely friendly..even offered me some soup while I waited last time since I had a large order that took longer than anticipated:) the sushi / sashimi is very tasty and fresh. Fair prices, great quality! Highly recommend for the Brampton area."}
{"text":"Being it's new I feel it is still going through and working out what works and doesn't work. With that said the food is actually pretty close to most of the typical fried roll fair that most all you can eat places have in town. I do like that it's close to my house and I don't have to go across town. The only thing I think they need to work on is the nigiri 
doesn't seem fresh as it should. The wait staff is attentive and polite. 

I will give it a higher star if they one can get better quality fresh nigiri rolls until then I am sticking to the cooked rolls and they need to serve beer and sake. I hope it stays around though, it has a ton of potential."}
{"text":"I've only been here for the $4.99 takeout special. I'm a bit surprised by all of the not so stellar reviews. It's $5.65, including tax and a drink...less than some of Starbucks' speciality drinks! I usually get a spicy salmon roll and a California roll. They're always fresh and tasty. Even when their takeout line is super long, the food comes out fairly quickly. No complaints at all about this place."}
{"text":"As you walk in the owner is always there to greet you so nice with a smile. You always receive the crunchy noodle soup (even if you are doing take out) it is sooo good, the food is always so fresh and amazing.

The only thing is that I wish there was an all you can eat sushi menu.."}
{"text":"Pretty average japanese place. I ordered a chicken teriyaki lunch special and the black dragon roll for take out. The chicken teriyaki tasted okay. Nothing special. The sushi would fall apart when I picked it up. I was kinda disappointed since I've read such good reviews about this place. v.v"}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW: 

I went back to this place again... to give it another chance. Again the service sucked, we didn't get the number of pieces we asked for (all you can eat) and sashimi was not fresh! To make this experience more epic, the server told us we have to finish those unfresh sashimi! Here is how the dialogue went...

Me:\" Miss these sashimi are not fresh, can you take them back please?\"
Server:\"Oh you're having all you can eat, so you have to finish them\"
Me:\"... I don't want to hold you accountable if I get food poison, so you should really take them back\"
Server:\"But you have to finish them\"
Me:\"... these fish taste soury and not fresh. If I finish them and start to throw up in 10 minutes, you're gonna have to be responsible for it\".

An epic ending to a TERRIBLE experience.


FIRST REVIEW: 

Do you enjoyed been bosses by servers telling what you have to eat? 

Do you enjoy servers yelling on top of each other when it's crowded? 

Do you enjoy asking the same thing 3 times and still don't get it?

If yes, this is the place to go. 

For \"all you can eat\" sushi, servers will not hesitate to tell you \"you cannot leave any food, otherwise, it will be charged at regular price\". Well excuse me, I suppose everybody is suppose to like damn cucumbers in a sushi roll. Please don't pick out your cucumber bits and pieces, or else, get ready to be schooled like a kid. 

What part of when people go out and have good, part of their money goes to server's politeness and friendliness, so these people not understand?! Really, people have to ask the same thing 3 times to get it. 

If you are doing \"all you can eat\", watch out, they will subtly cheap you on the number of pieces you ordered, or they will subtly leave out the pricy items. This consistently happened 3 consecutive times, you can't call that a coincidence. For examples, you order rolls, sushi and sashimi, you can bet your bottom dollar you won't get your sashimi unless you ask! This happened to our tables beside us, they had to ask for their sashimi after waiting for 20 min. 

To summarize, they'll school you on what to eat, they'll have attitude, you'll have to ask the same damn thing multiple times, and they cheat you by NOT serving you expensive items (sashimi namingly) unless you ask. 

Please, sushi restaurants with good service, good food and descent on serving customers exactly what they ordered, can these good sushi restaurants please destroy this place's business. A restaurant that cheats its customers order does not have a place in a competitive dining landscape. 

P.S.: Too bad Yelp doesn't have \"0\" or negative stars, or else I would not give this place 1 star."}
{"text":"Sushi House was amazing!  They have a great menu with Japanese and Korean items. 

I ordered the Bulgogi Beef and was very happy with portion size and quality. I still say the best Bulgogi is at Ka Chi in Korea Town, but this has got to be the best in Brampton.

My wife ordered the sushi pizza, and the spicy salmon. She loved it I don't like sushi, and even I found it to be good.

I highly highly recommend coming to try it out!"}
{"text":"Sushi house is the best sushi restaurant in all of the GTA! My husband and I love sushi and we've tried many different restaurants but nothing compared to Sushi House. Their avocado sushi is always so fresh, flavourful and delicious every time we visit them! We've taken family and friends and they've always had a great time! My husband vows not to visit any other sushi restaurant for sushi except Sushi House! We love you!"}
{"text":"I found three flies throughout my meal. One in the sashimi and two on a plate of sliced orange. When I told the waitress, she took the plates away and blamed the flies on the fact that they leave the door open. It seemed like she really was scared to get in trouble as she kept speaking to the boss and telling him that she swears that there were no flies when she handed the food to me... Why did they even leave the door open? I can't even begin to imagine how many flies live around the chef's table if I found 3 in my short time there. Don't visit Sushi House.... The prices are tantalizing but the place is really dirty and unhygienic. Not worth it!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  My husband is allergic to avocado, and they always made sure his food Is free of avocado. Awesome service."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi buffet restaurant. I've been twice for dinner. Sushi rolls are very tasty. Serving portions are perfect for sharing between 2 people. I found the price and service to be acceptable. Going back this Saturday!"}
{"text":"dont realy worth the price for AYCE in DT, too little option for AYCE, slow service. wont come back again"}
{"text":"The rolls and maki are very bad, the rice was mushy and the spicy sauce was terrible and too rich. The service was slow and the server was unattentive. If you really have to go here, please stick with nigiri. At least the rice was decent."}
{"text":"Another great new sushi place in BRAMPTON! 

I admit, I often roll my eyes when my parents, in Brampton, profess to have found a sushi gem in their neck of the woods but damn, they know their raw fish! This place exceeded expectations from decor to service to the yummy food. 

Conveniently located near the Brampton GO station downtown, the place offers standard sushi fare with generous helpings. The sashimi lunch is huge and fresh ($15) and the kamakazi roll is to die for. 

If in the area, I would strongly recommend loading up on your fresh sushi here!

One caveat...It's a bit chilly in here...I'd bring a sweater :)"}
{"text":"I have been a big fan of sushi restaurants and buffets for a long time. Decided to try this restaurant for a change today based on great Yelp reviews. Does not disappoint! The server is super friendly and has a nice relaxing atmosphere. The sushi salad and sashimi boat is delicious. Would come back again. Go when it is not busy."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend come here every Friday from dinner and we've never been disappointed. The service is extremely friendly and fast, and the food is delicious too. Their sushi is always made very well and is always fresh. Plus, they offer a brown rice option which is perfect.  Their other dishes aside from sushi are also delicious as well, and my favourite is their gyoza dumplings. Their tofu does not disappoint as well"}
{"text":"First time here and we loved it! Compare to other Japanese restaurants we've been, this place ranks in the top 3. Will definitely come back. Service is also great! We were so full do didn't get a chance to try their sorbet. Next time! Too full."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try despite the low reviews and since I love eating at China a go go. I must say this place is perfect! Beer and sushi is the best combination. My waitress was very nice and attentive and she did not get any part of my order mixed up. Sushi tasted great, fresh and was at a great price as well. I definitely love this establishment, will continue to come back."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad overall but I wouldn't consider it top quality sushi. The prices are definitely cheaper than what sushi would usually cost at a mall however, you do get what you are paid for. I ordered dynamite roll and a sashimi combo and I didn't consider the fish very fresh. The service was however nice and friendly."}
{"text":"New place, great idea by owner yo have Chinese, Sushi and Hawaiian BBQ in the same place. The all you can eat sushi is $5.00/less. Oh, and it tastes fresh. New, 6 months old from time of this review. Yah, why did I not come here to hide and eat?"}
{"text":"Sushi house is truly excellent.  The fish is very fresh and high quality.  The portions are generous.  The lunch sashimi don buri (hae dup bap) for only $9.95 is huge and delicious (small sliced raw fish over a bed of mixed greens, spicy sauce and bowl of rice).  They must lose money on that dish.  The salmon chirashi dinner is also huge - tons of thick sliced salmon over a bed of seasoned rice - I couldn't even finish it.  The sashimi dinner is excellent as well.  They also make a killer dynamite roll.  Tempura is fantastic here.   Their only downfall is their spicy salmon and spicy tuna maki rolls (they put that tempura crunch filler in them).  Everything else that involves slices of raw fish or deep frying is the way to go.  Love this place.  I hope they are around for a very long time."}
{"text":"Best take out in the city. For less than the price of a Big Mac meal you get 2 rolls (veggie friendly) and a drink. Open till 5AM on Friday and Saturday! 

They have great AYCE too- cheese wontons, volcano roll, and the tempura banana made a great impression. Wear pants with an elastic waist band though- the food baby I grew was pretty impressive."}
{"text":"Sushi House is located inside China A Go Go.   Its small and the kitchen extends to where Aloha A Go Go used to be - there's still some of Aloha's items on their menu! 

The sushi wasn't the best or the worst I've had in town.  They serve a la carte and AYCE which is currently $19.95 for lunch and 23.95 for dinner.  I could tell some seafood were just thawed out, but not too old.  The few items that stood apart to us were there Hurricane Roll, the Hotate (fresh scallop) nigiri, and green tea ice cream (rich in green tea flavor).

We received great service from our waitress, we saw that she was waiting tables here and at China A Go Go - what a hard worker!  Also the Asian/modern decor was beautiful inside and comes with a tatami room - great if you're with a big group and want privacy.

Overall this is a place to go to if you want to get your sushi fix and don't want to drive far if you live in the Sunrise Manor area."}
{"text":"Great place, great food and authentic and excellent service. The staff is friendly and this is the 5th time I have been to this sushi place and I have not been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great sushi but the service was extremely slow when we went on a Tuesday night. The crunch soup was good as well as the spicy salmon roll"}
{"text":"I ate a few pieces of the sushi with my hands, taken right out of the take-out container standing in the cold out front of the place. It didn't taste too bad for cheap sushi actually. But that's no the problem.

 while I don't expect alot out of a cheap sushi place, I do expect:
- edible and not terrible food
-average to below average service
-a place to sit

I have to give this place a 0 since they kicked me out of the restaurant. I guess I ordered \"wrong\" and when my sushi came all packaged up and I said no, I want to stay, but they could just not understand what I wanted. They made a big fuss about some extra charge. Even after I told them I lived 1 hour away and had nowhere to eat the takeout they still made me go. They apologized profusely, but the restaurant was not full at all and I didn't need an apology. I paid, and needed a place to eat. 

I ate a few pieces outside and had to trash the rest. There is zero chance I will ever return here."}
{"text":"I have not tried the all you can eat, but this place has bento boxes combo until 10PM at night. $6.99 gets you rice, seaweed salad, spicy chicken, edamame, orange slices, and miso soup and salad. Service is quite slow though because they only have one or two servers who do everything. It's not fancy sushi, but a pretty good option when you are in the area. The decor is not so aesthetically pleasing but who cares when you have sooooo much food in your bento box!"}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with their $4.99 take out lunch special for a cheap and quick lunch. They make the rolls astonishingly fast here so you can be in and out in less than 5 minutes, I swear!
I've only ever tried the vegetarian rolls or the ones w/ cooked salmon. They are great (mostly because of the incredible value for money). I've had cheap rolls before that are disgusting but this place is not that!
I also had dine in here (a la carte, not all you can eat) and didn't really think the dynamite roll was that great (the shrimp just didn't taste fresh). I
I know now to come here JUST for the lunch take out special. Never for the dine in!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon after experiencing some intense craving for sushi. And I have to say the spider roll certainly satisfied my stomach. 

The service was excellent considering it was just one server for a few tables.  She was nice and very pleasant and kept coming around to fill our water and asking us if we liked the food. 

The food was extremely filling!! The spider roll was definitely my highlights for the meal.  The bento box was what you expected."}
{"text":"You might as well go to Kyoto House. Their rolls are very sloppy. The teriyaki chicken is very dry, and their seafood fried rice is over loaded with soy sauce and pepper."}
{"text":"All you can eat for 20$, if you can't finish what u ordered u pay extra. The seating is ok not fancy. Food is decent , don't get the red dragon sushi . Banana crepes are good."}
{"text":"We visited at 7PM on a Sunday. This was our second visit. The first was not great (they told us their fish was frozen, so we had to wait... strange), but we just chose the closest place to eat. Our first plate came after 40 minutes. For each plate after, we waited at least 20 minutes. The white tuna sashimi pieces were smaller than those 2-piece lego blocks.

The servers were inattentive. No one came to check on us while we were waiting. I watched two tables get at least 8 plates of food, probably their entire order, before we got anything. It didn't make any sense. It was busy, but there were more than enough servers and sushi chefs working. Also, while we were waiting, at least 3 tables came in, sat down, then got up to leave. We should have done the same. It was a huge waste of time. 

Maybe this place is good if you get takeout? A lot of people came in for takeout, and they seemed to get priority, but were still waiting in the restaurant for a long time before leaving. Is this why it took so long to get our food? I'm not sure. It was just the worst ayce sushi experience of my life.

They also charge an automatic 10% gratuity, but still prompt for a tip... very misleading. 

I would not recommend going here, ever. It's not worth it. Do not go here!"}
{"text":"Sushi House has really upped their game the last couple of years. I've been back twice this month with the same friend and gotten good service and great food.

I just had to mention that their salmon chirashi for $12.95 is the bomb diggity. For that price you get more salmon sashimi than you can eat (~15 pcs), crab meat, sweet pickled mushrooms, plus all the garnishes and don't forget the soups and salad. I was very impressed. The salmon quality was awesome. For this price I'd choose the salmon chirashi over Toshi's sake don dinner (same quality, more expensive, even though I love Toshi's!)

And of course to end it off was the deep-friend green tea ice cream :)"}
{"text":"Very fresh and the service was great. Nice atmosphere as well. Our order came with two bowls of soup and a bowl of salad with was a nice addition. Its not all you can eat but the sushi dinner I bought made me pleasently full. Would come again."}
{"text":"We were very hungry so we ordered a lot of food and let me tell you that it is easily the best sushi in Brampton and Mississauga.  It's not all you can eat so the portions are the size of what you would expect of high quality sushi.   We will definitely be coming back when we want to treat ourselves.   
Nice job Sushi House."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for the AYCE and enjoyed the food and service. Tonight, I found myself walking down Dundas, famished,  with my significant other and saw a sign in the window for a \"Lover's Delight\" package, and decided to try it! It's a 6 course meal, so I wouldn't reccomend it for someone in a hurry, but it is great for a date night. This package includes drinks and dessert for $25/person which is quite reasonable, but your drink choices are limited. We opted for the red wine.
 There were actually a few choices to be made, for the starter you have the choice of Oyster Shooter or White Tuna Tartar, we opted for the Oyster Shooter. The head chef and/or owner brought it out to us and told us to drink it into our mouths but not to just swallow, to chew to get the flavour. Than there was a salad and miso soup course, followed by a couple of hand rolls and the lovers roll, which was cleverly shaped like a heart, and the cutest thing you've ever seen. This was followed by soup with your choice of meat, I had the chicken and s/o had beef, both were very good and this led to the entree. I had the beef short rib, which came with rice and I LOVED it, while my companion opted for the Salmon Lover's platter and he really enjoyed his as well. We washed this all down with the dessert course, which included a delicious little smoothie with whip cream, tempura banana, some \"frizzled cheesecake\" (in quotations because I'm still confused after eating it, it was good though) and ice cream. All in all, I enjoyed my meal, thought the presentation was great and had great service up until it came time to pay but that is because I think one of the servers went on break and there were some people picking up food so we ended up having to go up to get the bill. I would reccomend this package, and it's for a limited time only!"}
{"text":"Food is really good, and good service also! Their sushi is much better than most places in Brampton"}
{"text":"We had a very bad experience there not baby friendly 
And the food isn't that great either"}
{"text":"I came to sushi house for the lunch special with a friend of mine. This wasn't the first time we've been here but it's the first time that I've decided to leave a review. I've also ordered take out on multiple occasions without any problems.

When we came in we were quickly seated and began to order. I ordered the spicy bulgogi bento box and my friend ordered a salmon sushi platter (pictures included!). 

I loved everything that was included in my bento box and they were even willing to make some alterations to it that I wanted (changed all my tempura to vegetables). 

I recommend Sushi House to anyone wanting to try a good sushi place in Brampton."}
{"text":"- I've been here a few times and the service is just never consistent. 
- The music is way too loud to the point where I can't even here the person talking next to me. 
- The music makes the entire experience at this restaurant 10x worse and not enjoyable. 
- Though the price is good, the food is good one day and its rubbish the next
- The teriyaki sauce on my sushi roll was lumpy and looked like it was sitting out for a while
- Green tea always comes luke warm
- When the miso soup arrived, my bowl was all wet on the outside and the soup was cold
- Why does the bill have a 10% tip already attached to it?"}
{"text":"First time there & its was fantastic food was really good fast & its really clean place 

The bathroom was spotless 

Will be one of my favorite place to eat"}
{"text":"It's very delicious! Service is great, it's my favourite place to get sushi. I usually go at lunch and get their salmon chirachi, it's definitely worth it's money. Plus their crunch soup is the best it's what I loveee there!"}
{"text":"I tried their 16pc sushi take out special just like most of the other reviewers here. dont expect too much from this place.  sushi taste is 2 out 5. service is 0 out 5. Owner must not be paying more than what you pay for takeout special for his employees per hour. No smiles, kind of rude attitude. They are really good at making you uncomfortable while you are waiting for your food. I had my longest 5 minutes there. Be aware, cash only, you may get beat up if you show up with your card."}
{"text":"This is the best Japanese & Korean restaurant in the city of Brampton. I've visited this place several times and the quality of its food and service never fail to please. Generous servings and pleasant atmosphere. It is conveniently located right downtown of Brampton with parking in the corner plaza. Highly recommended to all who loves Japanese and Korean cuisine."}
{"text":"I would describe my overall dining experience at Sushi House to be DECENT. I went to Sushi House on a Friday night with two of my friends for their all-you-can-eat dinner special for $19.99. 

The restaurant was pretty busy and filled with customers, but luckily, we did not have to wait long and were seated immediately. I have to mention that the food I ordered was prepared pretty fast as well. The restaurant has a very cozy atmosphere, or in other words, crowded, but nonetheless, the spacing was still manageable. I would describe the service as being good as the servers were attentive and polite in nature. As for the quality of the food, my main criteria for rating my dining experience, the quality was mostly decent. 

I had a couple orders of the spicy salmon roll and philadelphia roll which I found to be decent at best. The amount of meat in the rolls were kept to a minimum and the rice did not appear to be of the highest quality. I wouldn't exactly grade the rolls as being terrible but would give it a pass. All I can say is that I've definitely tasted better sushi rolls somewhere else. 

I tried an order of the beef teriyaki and general tao chicken which I found to be decent as well. There were some food items that I did find to be pretty delectable. 

The cheese wontons, a house signature item, was delicious and would recommend for anyone to try. 

I also found the banana Crêpe and tempura banana to be delectable as well as they were well made. 

In terms of my personal recommendations for the restaurant, I guess it would depend on what you're looking for. If you are looking for high quality sushi and price isn't an issue, I would recommend looking somewhere else to dine. However, If you happen to be near the area and are looking for satisfactory food at a relatively inexpensive price, then I would recommend dining at Sushi house."}
{"text":"I had salmon sashimi and over the rainbow roll..everything was delicious, the salmon sashimi was so fresh and buttery, yuuumyyy..I will definitely return.."}
{"text":"I went in the evening for dinner with a friend and we chose from their a la carte menu. Their bento boxes were super affordable and the food was pretty quality in my opinion. It was filling for both my friend and I. 4 stars and not 5 because there were a lot of flies flying around because they left the door open."}
{"text":"Never eating here again. I had been a few times and they told me that their miso soup was completely vegetarian (no fish). The last time I went the waitress told me no it had fish in it. I asked for it to be subbed out for another of their soups that *is* vegetarian and she charged me $2 for it. Feeding vegetarians fish is bad enough (seriously!) but then charging me for a swap in soup, c'mon."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, great food ordered a boat of Sashimi and Sushi. Will be going there for more."}
{"text":"Love the sushi here. It's always Fresh and taste very good. The only knock I have is that half of the menu has cream cheese and I hate cream cheese in sushi. Other then that, this place is great $20 AYCE lunch per person and $25 for dinner."}
{"text":"The sushi was awful and not very fresh.  Their actual menu doesn't match what's on their website.  The service is terrible and the guy at the register was rude.  With all the other options in the area, there really is no reason to go here."}
{"text":"quaint lil mom and pop place, friendly staff, and good offerings, the server seemed a lil lost perhaps a long day in it for em. but the owner seemed to help out and take care of us real well. 

The crunchy noodle soup was different from any ive had before, and pretty tasty. I expected the salad dressing to be of a ginger base but was actually had an orange based sauce, tasty refreshing, and different from what ive had at most sushi places, while good it felt a lil watered down.  and kinda wish it was more concentrated. 

I appreciated the gentle reminder that the kitchen would close, but they never tried to rush us through our meal to get us out by close. 

The portion sizes are quite big as well and very filling. all around a good place to check out."}
{"text":"I would normally give this place at least a 3 star as I have been eating here about two years now. Great lunch rate with quick service and never had any issues until last night. 

Went for AYCE yesterday and the day before VD day. Higher prices were forced on us for the \"special\" day before Valentines Day. Extras were included but we didn't want them. We were forced to pay the higher amount. And they weren't busy and it wasn't too romantic IMHO. 

When the bill came the waitress didn't share the bill with us.  We were a table of four and she asked us if we wanted separate bills. Tips were mandatory for us and we were not advised nor were already shown the bill (I don't even know the rate). Credit cards were shoved into the machine to pay and not a word from the waitress that tips were already included. The machine prompts for more tip without any warning. I do feel cheated as we should have been advised by the waitress without the secrecy. 

I won't be returning. I wasn't treated like a proper customer with regards to the tip. All this for a few extra dollars, and it was a group of friends having dinner, not a romantic dinner. 

The food was ok. About average for AYCE. We had to ask for more tea three times (where other places almost annoy you hovering around you to try to fill up your cup).  Pieces of sashimi were small but you just order more. Service was quick. 

If it's cold outside go here as the heat vents are under the tables... you'll warm up in minutes."}
{"text":"This is one of my go tos when I'm craving sushi in brampton. 

The service here is great, they are friendly and attentive always greeting you as you walk in or leave. 

The sushi, sashimi and selection of rolls are fresh and delicious. Would definitely try all of the spicy tuna, salmon crispy rolls! Those are to die for! They offer combos that can feed two people for $40.00 to $50.00. 

The location is also underwhelming, located in the heart of downtown brampton near the four corners, you can easily find parking at the go across the street or they have a few spots available closer to the restaurant. 

Come here if you want quality and quantity out in the burbs of brampton."}
{"text":"The sushi was average, and the service was basic - nothing special. I had gone to an event straight after work and was looking for quick food - this was the first place that caught me eye - not totally empty and prices seemed reasonable.
The main thing to note is that they tack on a 10% surcharge on you after-tax total. I was one person and ordered off the regular (not AYCE) menu. I found it ridiculous and didn't tip above that - don't force an arbitrary charge on me. They also don't make a note anywhere that there will be a surcharge applied. I won't go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Just came back from dinner with my boyfriend at sushi house a place I've been to 20+ times over the last 6 years and I have never had to pay for leftover sushi ever.
Never here, nor any other sushi place I've ever been to in my life. 

Today (aka 30 mins ago) after leaving some sushi pieces, some fried rice we were asked to pay for the extra food left over ($2 pp).  Not a big amount sure but I told them I've never paid for food left over previously (I've left way more
than today) at SH or any other place
They said this was the rule and I said I know I've seen the warning on the menu for years lol
I asked if they've become stricter with their rules lately and no clear answer was given
I offered to eat the fried rice thus leaving about 6-7 pieces of different stray sushi roll pieces and they said no. I asked is this now a 'you eat literally 100% or pay situation', no clear answer. I also spoke to the ?boss or manager person. 

Will not be coming here again as this was an uncomfortable situation given the minimal amount of food that was left. It is also not worth the potential discomfort given the food is poor/mediocre at best. 

So watch out people, if you want to relax and enjoy your eating experience and not be so acutely worried about leftover food rules, it appears Sushi house is not the place to go."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now and it doesn't disappoint. Cozy interior with great service. Clean and intimate atmosphere with great fresh cute sushi. Don't find many, if any Sushi places like this in Brampton. I've had take out, a Sushi boat and A lunch Bento Box from here and I have no complaints. I love their teacups as it lets you know how to life a healthier and happier life. I'm a fan is all I can say."}
{"text":"Man fuck all these reviews,  just got done eating and it wasn't bad. All the rolls were decent.. service was typical for asians.. but asian service usually sucks everywhere anyways. but overall good. The mochi was subpar too.. but for the rolls and 20 bucks I'd go here again... maybe... #Eastside $$$$ !!!!"}
{"text":"What happened to the take out special? good price for adequate sushi. Now they've raised the price quite a bit but the quality is the same."}
{"text":"Just noticed this place in the woodbine centre today and decided to give it a try. Boy am I glad I did. The staff was friendly and outgoing, and the sushi was delicious. My husband and I tried the avocado and yam roll, the red Dragon roll and a set of mixed nigri. We were not disappointed. All of it was delicious and fresh. Will be going back there"}
{"text":"Fresh back from the Sushi house I decided to write a review. My family went out to a very nice dinner at the sushi house night! Our waitress greeted us very warmly in the beginning and was very courteous and prompt throughout our meal. The dinner started with the house \"crunchy noodle soup\" which was DELICIOUS. Most sushi/Japanese restaurants will just give you a bowl of miso soup (which came with the later meal) but this was a new take on the regular soup. I fully enjoyed it and though it was great. I ordered the Tuna sashimi dinner which was fresh and tasty. My meal came with a side of great tempura, soup and salad. 

One thing I was not impressed with was the house salad. I thought that the lemon citrus dressing given with it was not at all too appetizing. That was really the only downside I saw with the meal. My mother had a sushi boat which was well presented, my dad had the chicken katsu udon which was tasty, my brother had the tuna sushi dinner which was just as fresh as my sashimi (which was VERY fresh) and my aunt had the chicken teriyaki bento box. 

The food also came out very quickly. The only slow part was receiving and paying the bill at the end.

Final Verdict: Tasty, Fresh, Elegant, slightly expensive but what sushi isn't. Great place to go in Brampton!"}
{"text":"Well, food wasn't good at all, but the price for lunch is $13.99. Cheap but not a lot of selections and they will charge you $3 if you leave any left over sushi rice. It was only the two of us and they automatically charged 10% service charge which I wasn't so happy about. Anyways, would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"How's the food here? I wouldn't know. 

It's a Saturday night, prime dinner time - I get it. We were seated right away, but what came after was inexcusable. 

For TEN minutes we just sat there, waiting to order. 
Three different servers came by our table and not one of them checked if we were ready to order, asked for drinks, appetizers to start, etc. 
They would make eye contact and continue on. 

One of the servers came into the section repeatedly to run food, clear the table and just stared at us. 
Eventually, someone came to clean the table behind and finally acknowledged us. We advised her we had been waiting over 10 minutes to order and no one has come by.

Afterwards, the same server who had been circling our section while ignoring us, came over and asked us to give her another two minutes. Really?  
No apologies, nothing but, \"Just give me two more minutes\". She just went back to the kitchen and continued bringing food out. 

Needless to say, we left and we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite for cheap sushi lunch as a broke university student. It became the infamous joint for \"$5 dollar sushi\" (though sadly they've upped the price now).

However, my past few experiences have been pretty disappointing. First, my friend got food poisoning from the sushi. Next, I waited about 15 minutes for my order, just to realize they gave me someone else's order entirely and I didn't discover until I travelled too far and opened my food then. Finally, the last time I ordered I had such a hard time figuring out where my order was because someone's handwriting was so awful they weren't calling the correct name.

The service was never great to begin with, but with the constant confusion, price increase and quality slipping I'm not sure if it's worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Got lunch for the family from Sushi Park this weekend. It was pretty good and the whole family enjoyed their meal. 

The crunchy soup was delicious, the shrimp tempura was great and the 6 different rolls I ordered all tasted fresh and different. The food was made fast and it wasn't too expensive for the quality. Less than $ 100 for 5 people to gorge on.

My only issues, and these are personal preference, were that the calamari resembled onions rings in look and taste, and the chicken in the Teriyaki dinner was thicker in texture than I hoped.

Overall good food and I would definitely be back. 4 stars"}
{"text":"Definitely not a friendly AYCE sushi place. You don't get service and the vibe was unwelcoming. Also, they raise their price to $12.99 from $11.99, although their sign outside says otherwise. Sushi is normal, mediocre sushi you'd expect from a Chinese-run AYCE sushi joint but the staffs are totally unfriendly. And they tip themselves before you get to decide. Be careful and don't be scammed!"}
{"text":"PRICE:
They're only okay for their take out during lunch hours but even that is still questionable with quality and presentation. Just because the take out is cheap (4.99 for like 20 pieces)  does not mean its worth it! Their canned drinks are given warm (gross) .A couple years back, they used to be so reasonably priced for AYCE (18.99) and their food was phenomenal..I don't know what has happened recently over time but every time I have stepped foot in time and time again, i'm always leaving the place having a problem with them. Their prices have ridiculously gone up (AYCE 23.99 meaning around 25$) and on top of that have a 10% surcharge before you even get the bill so watch out for that because you will end up DOUBLE tipping them! Im not going to tip if the service was terrible in the first place , its not mandatory or by law that you have to do so. 

SERVICE: 
The waitresses don't know how to communicate properly at all, they always look like they're in space wandering about with a blank face, most of them if not all are rude  dropping the food onto the table, giving plenty of sighs,rolling their eyes at you, they dont check up on you and if you see or here them giggling looking over at you, it is likely that they are talking that smack! If you have a concern or problem, they dont care. period.

FOOD:
 The food is terribly proportioned now, shitty quality for the sashimi watch out for the salmon because i ordered a plate of it and it was discoloured, other foods were burnt and super overcooked. I ordered a black dragon roll and it was 3/4 rice and sloppy to little filling. You can tell they just slapped it on the plate with no care whatsoever. I ordered the beef enoki mushroom rolls and it was black, not even brown it was black meaning it was burnt same with the order of muscles I had. Don't forget the sashimi! Everybody looks forward to sashimi, and guess what! it never comes out unless you ask for it not just once but you must ask 3 or 4 times which is cheating your customers and making it very annoying to constantly ask! The portions of sashimi are also so tiny! The sushi on rice were also overfilled with so much rice that the seaweed surrounding it broke apart. Nearly every order that contained rice in it ended up being 90% rice and 10% whatever filling/meat.

Another occurrence I had was not being able to leave for 3 hours because of how terrible the service was. The service is super slow no matter what if there is a rush or if its not busy at all. They took 15 minutes to bring out a small plate of seaweed salad, and this is on an average day and no it was not busy which is what I found to be ridiculous! The many friends I have brought here were also disappointed, I wanted to give it another chance but I'm never coming back here ever again."}
{"text":"My lunch joint of choice when I am at the court house on University St. For $12, their all you can eat lunch special is excellent. The food is top notch, which is not always the case at these all you can eat places. As the all you can eat special tends to lead to overeating, I sometimes order a box meal instead. Their salmon roll products are excellent."}
{"text":"Another sushi chain restaurant with a decent variety but not comparable to the better places I've been. Regardless, food was decent but nothing overly special as the selection had most dishes you can find at other restaurants.

Service was pretty attentive and the waitresses were polite. We went during a busy dinner time too. They were also kind enough to fix an order they mixed up with another table.

The size of the place could fit a nice group of people and had several tables. Despite it being busy, it didn't seem chaotic and out of control.

Not a bad place if you are looking to have some sushi in your belly."}
{"text":"I ordered their spicy salmon roll and it turned out to be just a roll filled with only spicy mayo and deep fried tempura bits. When I asked the waitress, she explained that salmon had been mixed into the mayo (when clearly it wasn't neither in taste or appearance) and that no exchanges or returns could happen. On top I was charged extra gratituty (10%) after taxes automatically. I felt so ripped off of my money and unrespected as a customer."}
{"text":"What a great little gem, right off University on Dundas West. It has all the sushi you could want and more, at reasonable prices. The staff is friendly and very helpful.Service is quick as you like or paced . The Sappora draft is ice cold , good on a hot day. There is a nice buzz with happy diners enjoying the food.  Lunch offers all you can eat as well as a la carte. I've had both and liked very much on different occasions. This place is always consistent and that is a good reason to try it out."}
{"text":"Very very good sushi choice in the GTA. I was in town staying near the airport and decided to head out here based on the Yelp reviews. Took about 20 minutes from YYZ, easy to find and lots of parking when I went on a Saturday evening around 7. Ordered 3 rolls and miso soup, and they nearly had to roll (no pun intended) me out the door. The food was fresh and delicious and service was attentive and on time. Wanted to order mochi for dessert, but simply could not fit any more food after the sushi deliciousness!"}
{"text":"I like Sushi House, all of their food tastes good, but nothing really stands out as tasting great.

But I keep going back, even though New Generation Grill Fusion at Bloor and Bathurst tastes better, that's a looong drive if you're not already in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I got the 4.99 lunch special and to be honest, when you're craving sushi and you don't want to shell out much, this is a good option. Comes with a drink too, there's about 10 drink options to choose from including pop and juice. The sushi is fairly decent and tastes pretty good. I can only speak for the vegetarian rolls though.

I went in today to pick up lunch and unfortunately they messed up my order, they switched my food with someone else's. I immediately went back (~ 5 mins later) to let them know and they apologized and quickly remade my order fresh no questions asked. It was also done very fast, and I was out of there in 2 minutes. So if you're grabbing lunch, make sure to keep an eye out before they close the container of your sushi!

Lunch time can get very busy, but the line moves fast. Have your money ready to ensure a smooth process."}
{"text":"The spicy tuna roll and red dragon roll were surprisingly delicious. I was happy I was able to order to go and that this place is literally around the corner. My husband and I are definitely planning to return to try more items on the menu! China a go go has been our favorite and now they are including an upgraded sushi menu..awesome!"}
{"text":"I went here last year, and it wasn't as great as people said it was... Got a few dragon rolls and a lobster roll... They took forever even though the restaurant was half empty and it tasted like any other sushi..."}
{"text":"Worst experience at a sushi place. The food quality was ok, but it's the service where this place loses hard points. The waitress was rude from the minute we walked in. They took 50 minutes to bring the last items we ordered off the AYCE menu (sushi roll and beef mushroom rolls). By the time it came out, we were stuffed. There's an expectation that all food should come out within a range of time. We were charged extra per person for not eating the mushroom rolls... fine that's understandable since it's printed on the menu. 

What was not ok, was the fact that they automatically added their tip to the receipt (for a group of 3). When we brought it to the waitress attention, her response was consistent throughout the night, full of \"ughs, sighs, and okays\" and then when we called her rude, she started yelling at us. We called the woman who was left in charge and refused to take off the tip on the bill because the owner couldn't be reached by phone.  Now normally i would never leave without giving a tip because i've worked in the food sector but a tip is a bonus for a service well provided. It's not mandatory under any law, it's merely a courtesy, and this time I was beyond disappointed in the service and manner of this establishment. Never going again."}
{"text":"Delivery is just the worst. Took two hours to arrive. When I first called they said that latest would be 45 mins. Called again after 1 hour and they said it was on the way. Took another hour to arrive. Food was cold by that time"}
{"text":"Very good experience. Soup is inclusive of your order and it takes great. The glasses for the drinks come chilled so they add the extra touch of a good time. Definitely good place for some dinner!"}
{"text":"Honestly from reading all these other reviews makes me think otherwise because my experience with sushi house was fine. $4.99 + tax ($5.65) with pop is a steal deal and for the sushi it tasted pretty normal and good actually. Maybe not something like a five star sushi place would serve but then again it's only $5.65!  What do you expect? I got the spicy salmon crunchy roll with avocado sweet potato roll and the tempura was still crunchy along with the sweet potatoes. The sushi is at room temperature but it's not suppose to be cold either... And warm pop... Is fine as well its $5.65 what do you expect from $5.65. Anyways I've had a good experience & this deal keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends and we had a really good time. The restaurant was cute and had a nice ambiance. Our waiter was fantastic and really attentive. He kept checking on us to bring us more tea and water as we sipped away. I drink a lot and always notice if the waiter can keep up.

Four of my friends split one of the party trays and I ordered the salmon sashimi and sushi combo. My sushi tasted delicious. It was gluten and dairy free. My meal came with a miso soup and salad. The salad was really yummy and one of my friends enjoyed my soup. 

My friends party boat came with crunch soup, which they all enjoyed. It also fractured a large variety of rolls, which my friends really enjoyed. 

The prices were really good and my friends and I would return to this restaurant. :)"}
{"text":"A-MAZING! This restaurant has changed my life.

That might have sounded a little dramatic but it's true. As a frequent AYCE sushi goer, I have always been skeptical of a la carte sushi places because I'm cheap and didn't think there was much of a difference in quality. But it didn't cost that much more than AYCE sushi. And it was worth every penny because the quality of food is exponentially better than any AYCE sushi place.

The service and atmosphere were on point. We got two free soups to start. I'm not sure what the first one was called but it had some noodles in it and it was really good. The second soup was miso, which I'm not a fan of so I wouldn't know if it was good one way or another. Everything we tried was truly delicious and fresh. My boyfriend and I ordered the following and it was enough to keep us big eaters satisfied.

- Sashimi + Sushi Dinner All Salmon
- Spicy salmon roll
- Spicy salmon hand roll
- Spicy salmon dragon roll
- Fantastic roll
- Green tea icecream 

I highly recommend all of the above! This is my new sushi spot. A part of me is disappointed though... Sushi House is all I can think about ever since trying it two weeks ago.  I need help."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant. I've been here several times, most notably when I am in a rush. The food is served quickly, is of excellent quality (meaning fresh), and I tip despite the fact I told myself I'd not tip after minimum wage was increased. I tip only for exceptional food and service."}
{"text":"We went base on the reviews at Yelp and it was really nice experience the service was excellent and the food fresh and Yammuy the place decor nice as well ..defiantly we are going back it's one of those small but to go to places.."}
{"text":"The sushi is on par with average Japanese fare in and around the city, but this is by far the biggest steal I've seen in downtown Toronto for takeout. A mere $4.99 gets you 16 pieces of maki (the selection is not too eclectic but it works!) AND a drink. And this is (I believe) at any time of the day! (Note there is a $1 up-charge if you pay with credit) A full sushi dinner for under $10?! On Dundas?! I had a yam-avocado roll and (I think) a crispy avocado roll. The rice falls apart a little but I didn't mind :)

The service is just fine, and there is a huge TV near cash that will let you watch the game as you await your order. All around, exceptional value for the price. I should warn you that the AYCE lunch/dinner prices are comparable to those of the rest of the city (if memory serves, $13.99 lunch and $23.99ish dinner) - the takeout special is what I hope to come back for."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start to complain about this place. Seeing that it only has 2.5 stars AFTER having eaten here, somehow made me feel better knowing that others were equally displeased. 

Let's start with the positives : it's cheap, and their handrolls were one really good for a AYCE place. The nori is somehow very fresh and crunchy! 

Everything else sucks. It's March, and they have no heat on. I ate the entire meal wearing my winter jacket, and even by the end of the meal, my hands were still cold. 

The delicious handrolls I ordered, the ONLY reason I came to this place (It's my 2nd and probably final time), somehow were forgotten I'm the first order. That was informed to me in a as a matter fact tone, as another piece of paper was shoved in front of me. No apology. 

2nd trial to order these rolls, and of the 5 we ordered, 2 came. When asked about the remainder, instead of getting an apology, we were essentially given a look of doubt as of we did something wrong, and given a lecture about how to use the sheet, as if we were born yesterday, and didn't know how to write 1 or 2. 

3rd time was a success, but I took a photo of the order sheet in front of the rude waitress. I wonder if she spat in my food... 

The carelessness of this restaurant and the rudeness of this waitress made my blood boil,  but it still wasn't enough to warm up my frozen hands.   I almost wanted to give her a lesson on how to talk to customers properly, but was too upset to do it in a productive way. 

Guess they could tell I was going to leave no tips, so when the bill came, gratuity was already included 

Stay away from this place, unless you want delicious handrolls, and have a very warm jacket, and the patience of a saint."}
{"text":"Sushi House is very close to where I live, so I have a special place in my heart for this warm, welcoming spot. These days it's also nice to see a sushi restaurant that isn't an all-you-can-eat or buffet--Sushi House is always fresh to order. 

I am not much of a sushi person, though my husband is, so I can't say much about the quality of their sashimi and fish products, but their non-fish food is delicious and prepared with as much love and care as the raw stuff. 

They have lots of a la carte options (including vegetarian rolls) as well as lunch and dinner combos. Also, I love that no matter what I order I seem to end up at least with a cup of miso soup and a tiny ball of ice cream at the end, which is always a nice touch. 

The service is excellent. It's friendly and low-key, but attentive.

I would go here at any time of year, but I often find myself drawn to it during colder times, as I always leave feeling warmed and nurtured."}
{"text":"The best sushi place in brampton. it's not an all you can eat and because of that it can get pricey but you get what you pay for. Their rolls are amazing and always fresh and the service is always good. The crunch soup is authentic and so yummy, they give you a small bowl of it once you sit down but I could have it all day. The owner is super nice and makes sure you get the best quality."}
{"text":"Came to check this place out with a friend that's new to sushi due to the great reviews. 

We came on a Monday night and was surprised  at how busy it was. We were seated immediately  to a tightly crammed room but moved to the next table as my friends chair would have been blocking the entire doorway.

It was the first time I've been to a sushi place and not been brought tea almost immediately. In fact we were never brought tea during our entire visit-strange. 

My friend ordered a chicken teriyaki bento box and I ordered a sushi/sashimi dinner. Her meal arrived a good 10 minutes before mine which I thought was odd considering her food required cooking. 

Both of our meals were to include salad and soup. I never did receive salad and we were both brought \"complimentary soup\" Odd it was presented that way when it was supposed to be part of our meal.

I was going to only give 2 stars based on service , but the quality of the food brought it up a star. Everything that we ordered was very good. The portions were generous, the fish was super fresh, and the tempura was perfection. 

I will come back again with very low expectations on service and accuracy if for nothing else an order of beautifully prepared tempura."}
{"text":"This was one of the best sushi experiences I've had, which is saying a lot given that I travel to a new city every week for my job and always try to hit a highly rated local sushi bar at every stop.the meal was shockingly good fro. Start to end, especially given its humble mom and pop feel.

Before you even order, you are given an appetizer bowl of soup (not miso but something Asian and delicious) even if you are ordering takeout.

I ordered the sashimi dinner which was a little under $20, but it was something I would have readily paid more for at another restaurant. The menu said 18 pieces, but when the plate was brought out, there was more than 20 pieces of generous and colorful slices of fish. This is one of those dishes that serves the classics and does it well; nothing strange, new, or out of the expected ordinary. However every bite melts on your tongue and tastes absolutely fresh. They even double up on salmon sashimi which is my personal fav so major kudos there!!

Got the green tea ice cream for dessert just to cleanse the palate with a few bites and it tasted so good that I unwittingly ate it all. Perfectly creamy and sweet without being overly sugary.
 
Did not expect to find such a fantastic meal here in small town Brampton!"}
{"text":"Meh...the sushi tasted like the fish had been frozen and thawed. I was not impressed. The service was great, but the grade of sushi was not up to par with other AYCE sushi in the area. I'd pass up this restaurant and go to Kaizen or Sushi Kaya...they are worth the drive."}
{"text":"So had lunch here yesterday and it was good.

It's great that they have lunch/dinner specials at good prices especially for the quality you get here.  

The ambiance is nice when you walk in as it has the Japanese feel and the servers wear kimonos too.  Servers are friendly and polite.

I got a lunch special with spicy salmon, spicy tuna and spicy crab sushi...you can really taste the quality in the fish here compared to going to your average all you can eat as this is a la carte.  Each lunch special is served with soup and salad.  My friends got the teriyaki salmon bento lunch special and my other friend got the teriyaki chicken lunch special...all with a good serving of tempura that came with the special.

The only tip I would give the restaurant is the crunchy soup they give out, they should bring a little bowl of the bits on the side instead so that we can put it in ourselves so that it will still actually be crunchy...by the time it got to the table, just soggy bits in it.

Overall, still a nice place to go to and I would still go back again."}
{"text":"Service was rude. They actually charged me for the wrong meal. Food wasn't the best. Something about it threw me off. 

Think again before coming back."}
{"text":"First of all the food was good and the service was ok. What really pushed this down and perhaps should have gone lower is that I was using the restroom and the sushi chef came out of the stall and went back to his station without washing his hands. Right in front of me. WTF. Puts a damper on the whole thing."}
{"text":"Sushi here was mediocre - rolls were encased in very thick sticky cold rice and limited options. Sashimi was fresh but were served in tiny portions. Overall the food was a little below average to what you'd find at other sushi restaurants on the same strip. 

The services was the worst part. Our server looked miserable and was rude - rolling her eyes at us, throwing food down at the table, walking away when we asked for something, and never came by to check on us. Our dragon rolls took 40mins to come out."}
{"text":"First time visitor, was pleasantly surprised. Small but nicely decorated, our booth was plenty spacious. Menu is extensive, we ordered agedashi tofu and edamame to start, and bibimbap as main, all were excellent esp. the tofu. Only real fault I could find is that the chopsticks are one-use throwaway ones, will bring my own next time."}
{"text":"Pretty good, fresh sushi. Nice ambiance too. I'm not quite as floored as others are however, and Toshi remains my top for Brampton. A couple of the rolls were a bit imbalanced, for example: the cucumber in the cucumber roll was served in long julienned pieces which went out a inch beyond the roll. It made it a bit too, um... cucumber-y (new word?).
But, I don't want to be too harsh on the place, as I still enjoyed myself and it's very close to home - so return visits are likely."}
{"text":"Since discovering this location inside the Woodbine Centre, we've eaten here about seven times and have tried takeout for eating in the food court, pickup for takeout and delivery (over $25).  Firstly, service is always super friendly and fast.  Even delivery was impressively prompt.

We've tried the bento boxes (salmon, chicken and beef), green dragon rolls, vegetable teriyaki (shrimp) and seaweed salad and every time, we were never disappointed.  We're not sushi connoisseurs but very much enjoyed our orders.  The green dragon rolls were huge!  Portions are very generous.  I always love variety in my food so tend to always default to the bento box.  For $9.99, you get 3 gyoza, 4 veggie tempura, 1 crabmeat tempura, 1 shrimp tempura, 3 cucumber rolls, 3 salmon rolls, miso soup, side green salad, rice and your choice of salmon, chicken or beef.  Can't go wrong!  

They also have a stamp card where you can earn towards a freebie.  

Hope they stay around as this is literally the only sushi restaurant in the area and we love them.  Love that we can keep the menu handy for nice delivery when we just don't feel like cooking!"}
{"text":"They take orders and herd customers for take out. Its like 8$ for 16 pieces of mediocre sushi and a drink. Too much rice and barely any fish etc... Tried the spicy salmon, california, and crispy crab roll. Will not return for take out. Ayce is more worth it."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and me were up for some Sushi yesterday night. So we decided to Yelp it from my iPhone. Well, are we ever glad that we did. We went on Ana R's review and decided to give it a shot. 

The atmosphere was very welcoming and the restaurant was very clean. The service was outstanding. 
We started the dinner with our favourite Seaweed salad and the Miso soup. Very Goood! I love it!
We had three different Maki rolls (Volcano, Chef Maki and the Dynomite) the Volcano rolls had an excellent little bite to them. 

We also had our favourite Sushi Pizza with Crab. We managed to eat everything! Holy Mole-y!

One word...Go!"}
{"text":"I thought my bento box was terrible...
Did not like the sushi, rice, tempura, fruit or vegetables. Miso Soup was fine. Thought vegetables tasted blah, and even my slices of fruit weren't good. I left most of the meal on the table, and I typically never waste food. 

The final end to the meal was that there was a surprise service charge added to my bill. I asked about it and got a poor explanation that 'it was something added on between the kitchen and the [floor] I did not leave a tip (if there is a mandatory service charge)

Definitely sub-par, not worth going to, support better Japanese food"}
{"text":"I came here tonight with my roommate because I saw their amazingly advertised Take-Out deal outside the restaurant. Allowed to choose \"any 2 rolls (16 pieces) + a free drink for $4.99\", I was pretty darn excited to have found such a cheap gem! ..Turns out, I was immensely disappointed. For starters, the $4.99 price only applies if you pay in CASH, which is nowhere stated on the advertisement outside. It costs $5.99 if you pay by credit/debit card. Then, I had ordered 1 \"spicy salmon roll\" and 1 \"spicy white tuna roll\" but when I opened my box, they were both spicy salmon rolls. For my \"free drink\", I ordered an orange juice and was handed a plastic bottled no-brand 34g sugar drink diluted with orange food colouring.. And now, I save the best for last - when I finally found a place to sit down and enjoy my dinner, I opened the box to see not 2 salmon rolls, but realistically, a box of fried tempura batter wrapped in rice. There were barely any VISIBLE pieces of salmon... and oh right, the shock nearly made me forget - I ordered spicy salmon rolls to begin with, not the spicy tempura salmon!!!!

You can imagine my disappointment. Not to mention, the pieces of sushi were really small too. And to add to this mess, the employees weren't exactly polite either. Didn't seem like business was too busy but the employees were really rushed and made me feel like I was bothering them. Note: this was for take-out too. 

I have no foreseeable intentions of coming here again."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Sushi House when my girlfriend and I had a random sushi craving.

It was my first non-ayce experience of sushi within Brampton. It was also, by far my favourite sushi place in Brampton as well.

We ordered 4 different rolls, 3 of the rolls were the perfect size and taste. We ended up eating 3 rolls and took one to go. However, as soon as I got home, I quickly finished the last roll too! 

The only roll which was disappointing was the spicy salmon. I didn't like their style at all, it was a mash of salmon and spicy mayo, giving a very mushy texture. The sweet potato roll, the tuna roll, and the special roll were all fantastic though.

The restaraunt itself was a decent place to sit down. The service was mediocre, only time I saw the server was when I paid and when I ordered my food. I asked for spicy mayo and they gave me a really small amount which was a bit awkward.

Definitely making this my go to sushi spot from now on in Brampton."}
{"text":"Super Good Sushi in Brampton! The fish is fresh and the service is above board!  Definitely a diamond in the rough!

The location is located right across from 7 Eleven and parking is free right beside the restaurant.  I consider myself a Sushi snob and this place ranks right up there in my Top 5 Sushi places in the GTA.

GO HERE for Quality and fairly priced Sushi!"}
{"text":"I have been here once or twice in the last 8 years but recently came here in march on a friday night. I called to make a reservation in case and when we got there, the place was busy but not packed.  

Both me and my bf ordered from the sushi combos which come with 5 piece tempera,  a salad and depending on the combo 21 to 24 pieces. My combo was all sushi rolls. The sushi was fresh but not very flavourful. The tempera was crispy. They forgot to bring us our salads which they corrected at the end of of meal. We ended up paying over $60 with tax. 

In the end, I would rather go to an AYCE for that price as the quality wasn't any better then other sushi restaurants I have been to."}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant in Brampton. There is a lot of variety and value meals on the menu;complete with Korean and Japanese cuisine options. The service is great."}
{"text":"Yet another Chinese run AYCE sushi place. Nothing special here, except for their $4.99 takeout special which seems to generate a lot of negativity on yelp. To me, their $4.99 special is ok. It's cheaper because they are smaller, less selection, and uses more \"filler\" material. Walk just 2 mins away to Sushi & Bento and their takeout special is $6.99 and noticeably better. Gallery Sushi a little west of here also has better takeout special. But if you feel cheap and don't need a lot of food, I guess it's alright. 

Their AYCE is what you expect a run of the mill AYCE sushi place to be like. Nothing noteworthy, but not a terrible choice if you just want to stuff yourself."}
{"text":"Really good deal - 5 piece salmon sashimi for $4.99! Service was good, the food was quickly made and the sashimi was very good quality for an extremely good price! Definitely check this place out"}
{"text":"The waiting staff seemed confused. The sushi was meh. Found a piece of hair in my tempura shrimp. Yikes."}
{"text":"Came here again with my boyfriend. We decided to try the sushi and sashimi combo. There was an assortment of sashimi, some sushi and 2 simple maki rolls.  Everything was OK, but my problem is that when it comes to sushi or sashimi I only like salmon. In the end we also ordered a dynamite roll, which was delicious!

Despite a lower rating from my older review, I still really like this place and will continue to come here!"}
{"text":"Dear god I hope I don't get sick from eating here lol. 

Ordered shrimp tempura appetizer(really fresh and crispy-delicious). The a go go roll. The salmon, yellowtail, ikura(salmon roe), super white nigiri. And the surf clam. Everything came out room temperature-to warm. I mean, I know it's hot outside but I don't think sushi should be served warm lmao. Praying I don't get sick. All the fish came out a little mushy. The ikura didn't pop at all lol. Uh the only thing semi good was the yum yum scallop nigiri. And the surf clam. Although I'm pretty sure the texture should be firm yet chewy, this one was mushy and chewy haha.

The a go go roll has shrimp tempura inside, imitation crab and cucumber wrapped with shrimp topped with eel sauce. I think the roll would've tasted fine without the eel sauce, because their eel sauce is pretty bitter for some reason. I thought usually it's kinda sweet but nope, this thing was sweet and bitter, kinda like a breakup.

Um yeah so 1 star for being right by my house. 1 star for having Dr Pepper. 1 star for attempted customer service. I'll be back for the cooked/deep fried stuff, dr pepper(dr Pepper is life), and mochi but other wise, I'll pass on the fish.

Actually. The mochi was gross. The outside literally had a texture of wax. I just peeled that shit off and ate the ice cream inside. Green tea ice cream good too.

Despite sorry service I still tipped 20%. F&B can relate lol. I'll be back if I have the super munchies and don't feel like going far. Peace."}
{"text":"I frequent this place and the food is usually amazing, but I've noticed the service deteriorating in the past months. Yesterday I went in when they opened to treat my brother to a birthday meal and we were extremely disappointed. First, the place was freezing. We all had to keep our jackets on which is not acceptable in my opinion. This place is usually pretty cold in the winter, but yesterday it was just ridiculous. I am going to assume there was something wrong with the heating because they did say they were working on it and the server did try to bring us tea to warm us up, but it was so uncomfortable. We were also in about 15 minutes after open and they were still setting up the restaurant rather than serving which was odd as well.

My husband got the salmon bento box which he said was delicious, but all the sushi we ordered was cold and the rice was hard which is not the norm for this place. My brother, who we were really excited to bring to our favourite sushi place was really disappointed by the food and surprised that we enjoyed it so much. I had the avocado crunch roll and the rice was hard and avocado was really cold to the point that there was no flavour. I went to ask the staff if the rice had been made that morning and no one really answered so I asked them to remake it which they did without any trouble. Here's what really bothered me: once remade it was delicious - perfect texture and temperature. I gave a piece to my brother to try and he was amazed by the difference and wished he had his remade, but had no reference point to know it wasn't made properly as a first timer. It really makes me wonder if materials from the night before were being reused in the morning which is really disappointing. 

I would've given this place an easy 5 stars when I first started coming, but I don't know if I'll be frequenting as much after the past few experiences (probably not in the winter). My husband and I have also brought lots of friends here who frequent it as well and also notice the drop in quality.

I'm giving 3 stars based on past experiences but if I was basing it on yesterday I would probably give a 1.5. Hopefully once the owner is back things get better."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's a cute restaurant in Brampton. Great food!!.. fast service and nice atmosphere. The staff is always very friendly. Good for date night or group outings"}
{"text":"We went to this sushi place not expecting much but was quite pleasantly surprised. The ambiance is nice, waitress was friendly and the food was good. The sashimi tasted amazing...fresh and buttery. The tempura batter was light and crisp and not at all oily. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Oh man.....this place's takeout special is incredible. I come from America where sushi is pretty expensive most of the time. When I found out that they had 16 pieces of sushi for $6 (plus a drink), I knew I had to check them out. I ordered the Crunchy Salmon and the Spicy Salmon rolls. Both rolls were pretty good. They were also ready in less than 5 minutes and I was there ordering takeout at around 6:30 PM, so that was pretty impressive. My only complaint is that my soda was not cold at all. Other than that, I was pretty happy with this place. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a cheap sushi dinner."}
{"text":"I have tried their takeout option where it's $5.99 for 16 pieces plus a drink of your choice. 
Also tried their chicken teriyaki bento. 
They give you a lot of food for the price that you pay, however the overall quality is average. I would come here when I don't want to spend as much money, but I still want a meal with a decent portion. 
Friendly staff and they are usually efficient with getting your food out on time. 
The restaurant environment is usually louder because it's a smaller setting and it's usually quite busy. Simple and clean decor.
I come back to this restaurant often during lunch hours because of the quick service and cheaper prices."}
{"text":"Best sushi in West GTA!!!!! Been going every other Friday for years. Great staff. Super friendly. Suggest reservations. Kudos to Sharon, Nicholas, Vivien, and Angela.  The other Fridays we experiment with other sushi restaurants in MISSISSAUGA and Brampton, but none have been able to beat the quality and the experience. Note: they do have one private booth that can hold 7-8 adults (shoe removal required) Reason for delayed review is I didn't want anyone to know. Lol"}
{"text":"They have an amazing takeout deal- 16 pieces for 5.99 which is a ridiculous price. But this review won't be based on the takeout rather their AYCE experience.

I remember coming to Sushi House when it had green painted walls and I must say the new decor is much more appealing. The menu style is pretty much the same, they give you a paper and you write down how many you want. The menu is pretty much standard with some unique finds like squid sashimi, cheese wonton and banana tempura and crepe. The quality of the sushi is on par with other AYCE sushi in the area nothing spectacular. Everything tasted fresh and hot items were piping hot which is a good sign. 

The servers were very attentive almost too much so. They kept coming around with water and taking the empty plates away at first anyways. It got to the point where they would just come over to our table and look at if we were eating or not and if there was an empty plate they wouldn't take it away. It was off putting. We were there kinda late but definitely not past closing time, there were also other customers in the restaurant still. One of the girls started to mop the floor right next to our table with the bucket left next to us. I understand you need to clean but it didn't seem like the most comfortable setting to be in..

There is 10% tip already included in your bill no matter how big of a party you are with. Dinner comes up to about $26 including everything."}
{"text":"So I was skeptical but decided to give it a try and boy was it a huge mistake. The oil that they used to fry their rolls was old it tasted like burnt oil it was horrible. I struggled to finish and then as I was eating I noticed a hair sticking out of one of the rolls gross. I will never return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Took a little longer to get our rolls but they were exactly as described on the menu. They were fresh tasting and they kept my glass full. For ayce its average (just like sushi kaya) but they werent prepared as quick. There was a little longer then average wait time but if your in the area its fine."}
{"text":"Most fresh sushi I've ever head at west end!!! Got the sushi and sashimi boat for two, super good, will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat but my second time I found a piece of foil paper in my sushi. Wish I took a picture of it but my friend witness it and my server. Not so sure if I should go back. Knowing that could of done some serious internal bleeding."}
{"text":"Paired up with GoGo House great sushi with fast service and good prices. All you can eat is 23$"}
{"text":"Absolutely a hidden gem and my number one go to if I need a fix of Sushi in West Toronto. My personal favourite is the \"Hwaedobap\" (a beautiful mix of raw fish, rice, veggies and of course sweet and spicy red paste). Have that with a side of beef Kalbi and you are in heaven. The staff are quite nice and I like the design of the restaurant. Perfect spot for a reasonable family lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This place is bar one the best non all you can eat sushi joints in Brampton. Really good value for the money spent. Average lunch will run you 10-15$ I wouldn't be afraid to take a date here, actually I would highly recommend it. Presentation is amazing and staff is knowledgeable and friendly.

This place deserves your money, and with parking in the back it makes for a more pleasant experience. 

My only negative would be they should have a bigger restaurant with more seating."}
{"text":"I'm from Toronto and come all the way to Brampton just to eat here! A really friendly servers, best beef teriyaki and reasonable price! It's hard to find restaurant like this in Toronto!"}
{"text":"First things first, this is a sushi restaurant with good service. I may have to repeat that. This SUSHI RESTAURANT has GOOD SERVICE. 

I literally did not know that was a thing that could exist. I have never had friendly attentive service at a sushi restaurant and so have learned to expect forgotten items, surly servers and a generally lacklustre customer service experience. This is not at all the case at Sushi House. Last time I came here, we were greeted by the sushi chef upon arrival and then promptly greeted by our server with a smile.

The decor is very nice; probably the most pleasant setting for sushi in Brampton.

The sushi itself is delicious and reasonably priced for high quality fare. My last visit made me wonder why I don't come here more as opposed to going for AYCE.

Try the plum wine! Only $5/glass and very interesting, sweet taste!"}
{"text":"This place was close to my house and I didn't feel like driving to my normal sushi places across town so I figured I'd give it. A try, I walked in and no one greeted us. So we patiently waited for someone to approach us. We were told to sit anywhere  and were rudely pointed to the ONLY clean table in the place. Literally they weren't even busy yet managed to have every single table dirty. As we sat down I saw the worker go grab a menu from two of the dirty tables. Literally these sushi menus were under a pile of trash from previous people who had eaten there. And the worker handed them to us without even cleaning them. How gross. I asked if he could wipe them down and he acted like it was a huge ordeal. Then he Ridley walked away without even asking us what we wanted to drink. I sat there for a minute in disgust. If I hadn't of asked for those to be cleaned, would they ever of?! I was disgusted so I told my BF let's just drive to our normal spot across town. We walked out and no one batted an eye."}
{"text":"Sushi house located in Woodbine Mall, closest to the entrance of the food court. I'm always short on time at lunch so it's a quick in and out trip. Sushi is always available, and they also prepare udon, bento box, or anything else on the menu which I've yet to try. Prepared sushi has always been fresh to taste. If I'm not feeling for all you can eat, and just need to satisfy my sushi craving, sushi house is a guaranteed pit stop when in the area."}
{"text":"I saw a nice $8.99 sushi combo #3, which included 2 pieces salmon sushi, 8 piece dynamite roll, 8 piece crispy shrimp roll, salad, miso soup. On the side of the street, I ordered this combo and walked to Sushi House.  According to yelp, this combo or something similar - substitute salad and miso soup for a drink? - only costs $4.99.

This place was packed. I could barely get in through the narrow entrance way and there was a line to order takeout running through the middle of the restaurant. I had 7 minutes left to wait to pickup my food according to the app, but because there was no other space, I just waited in line.  The good thing was that the food was on time. The bad thing was that it was a bit confusing and not as straight forward as previous Ritual experiences. I showed my phone with the app to a few employees before they knew where to direct me. Eventually, I got to the cashier and she made me sign a receipt with my name - even though you shouldn't have to do this with the Ritual app. 

The food wasn't that great but still edible - I didnt even ending up finishing the crispy shrimp roll because this thing was mostly crisp.

In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this place, even though it's on the cheaper side. I'll def check the reviews before I order next time.  Luckily, I got this meal for free via the Ritual app."}
{"text":"I would like to give this place a better rating but the service was pretty bad, no one came over to me after I had been seated for 10 mins, no water nothing. But the most important in my opinion the food was great, I got the green and red dragon. Due to the fact the there aren't many sushi restaurants in Brampton I will most likely be back."}
{"text":"This place is great for their takeout special, 2 rolls + pop for $5.65 cash tax included. however if you're looking for \"authentic\" fresh tasting sushi this is probably not the place for you. I'm a student on a budget so this place is my go to- it isn't consistent even though I get the same thing every time. Still didn't get food poisoning yet! Lel"}
{"text":"My review is on the Hurricane, Lisa Lisa, Las Vegas roll and I believe the name said fried Johnny or something along those line, as well as the service. 

Pros: 
3 minutes away from my house..

Sushi was made pretty fast.

Flavor was good. I can say it's comparable to some of the other bigger AYCE. (At least the rolls I tried)

There is basically 3 restaurants in 1. You can order out of all 3 menus incase someone is not up for sushi. 


Cons: 
The place has 3 doors I believe and it can be pretty confusing, I went in through the door right under the sign that said Sushi house and it was a Sushi Bar. The sushi chef asked me if my order was for here or to go and I said here so he had me go down the hall into China a go go, once there I was just standing by the door and nobody greeted or seated me, I then went up to the counter and asked if I can just sit anywhere and he then sat me at a table, asked for our drinks .. I ordered my food, and while we were waiting we accidentally spilled some soy sauce, it was obvious the table had to be wiped but even after they brought us our drinks they did not offer napkins or wipe the table. 

The place needs more organization. More waiters maybe, I only saw one handling all tables for both restaurants. I'm sure once more waitresses are hired the above problems would take care of themselves."}
{"text":"I usually come here for their lunch take-out special, but I have also been here for the AYCE lunch buffet.

TAKE-OUT SPECIAL (5/5): They offer $5 for 16 pieces of sushi and a can of pop. Theres about 8 or so options for sushi and you can choose 2 different types (I recommend spicy salmon for one of them). It's $5 if you pay with cash and $6 if you pay with debit or credit. If you're not into sushi, you can also get fried rice. They advertise it as a lunch special, but you can order this any time of the day. Best bang for your buck!

AYCE LUNCH (3/5): Trust me, stick to the take-out special if you're coming here. The lunch buffet options are very oily and quality of food is average. There's other AYCE sushi options down the street for cheaper."}
{"text":"Great to have sushi to accompany my bubble tea so I ordered the spicy crab meat.  

It tasted yummy, but I could tell that it had been sitting there since the crunchy part which I think is tempura was a little soggy.  

My boyfriend ordered some noodle dish that was alright but nothing with a wow factor.  

If I do decide to come back I would ask to make it fresh before my eyes because the food court has many other things to offer."}
{"text":"My sushi was fine but not a standout from other sushi restaurants I have enjoyed. Service was friendly but extremely slow. My daughter had the salmon teriyaki, which she thought was okay. Note that they do not offer brown rice or gluten free soy sauce."}
{"text":"Aloha A Go Go used to be known as just serving Hawaiian based food with side sushi rolls. But ever since they've combined their restaurant with China A Go Go and became one establishment, they've added the name Sushi House. So if you order take out, you might be directed to either side when you pick it up. They do delivery as well and are usually on time. Never had a problem with that.

Their main menu looks completely different, as it only looks like they serve sushi, but you can still order all the same Hawaiian food items from before. They've even kept their old menu taped on their window!

They offer All You Can Eat (AYCE) sushi for both lunch and dinner. I personally haven't done AYCE here, but I've ordered to go countless of times. I've tried almost all of the sushi on the menu and it always turns out yummy and fresh. Prices seem to be in the same range as other AYCE restaurants as well.

It's not my go-to sushi place, but it's a great joint when you're craving for something quick and you're in the area. Plus it's far from where I live and I wouldn't travel all this way for this restaurant compared to other authentic Japanese sushi houses.

Staff is not very personable when it comes to customer service, which may come off as being unfriendly to some. But it doesn't really bother me since I only get food to go when I'm in the area visiting friends.

It's a great place to try when you're not looking for formality in an eatery and when you just need to feed your tummy with good food. lol

*Since Aloha A Go Go and Sushi House are one establishment, but are known by two different names, I have written the same review for both check-ins*"}
{"text":"Sushi House, such a nice place. Very close to downtown Brampton but nonetheless, a really good place to eat.

I had the pleasure of trying the majority of their items for a friends birthday and I must say, all of the sashimi, nigiri, and everything else we ordered came out absolutely amazing!

The interior of the restaurant felt really nice, given that there was a very traditional to modern take on the booths that you would see if you were eating in Japan. Definitely would recommend coming here.

Please do take note though, this is NOT an AYCE restsurant!"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else, the food takes over an hour, the costumer service is extremely lacking and rude, and to top it off they add gratuity to your bill without telling you."}
{"text":"I didn't expect a place like this in Brampton but Sushi House is a decent option for Sushi. The quality and execution was alright, I just wouldn't go out of your way to try it. 

You're greeted by a warm and modern interior and the menu is seriously impressive with their breadth and scope of items. There were so many different kind of special rolls, and there's just about everything here from ramen to salads to bentos.

To start off I'd absolutely recommend getting their spicy salmon salad. It's probably the best thing there. There's a ton of greens, and a ton of salmon sashimi here and by that I mean, a huge chunk of it. It wasn't overly mixed with breadcrumbs and it was actually spicy in a totally good way. I could have only gotten that and would have been happy with it. 

The other two dishes were a bit of a hit and miss. The sashimi quality is generally fair but the temperature was warmer than we would have liked. Some of the fish were colder than others but overall they're generally on the warm side. The spicy salmon dragon roll was better; there's plenty of spicy salmon on top and the inside of the rolls were plentiful but I couldn't help but to notice that the shrimp tempura was a tad stale and was completely overpowering."}
{"text":"I went here for date night with my man friend last evening and really enjoyed our experience.

When we arrived, the restaurant was very busy with the servers and owner bustling around (good sign). 

We were warmly greeted and brought to a nice sized table.

Ordered a hot sake to share and my guy got a chilly Sapporo - perfect!

I really enjoyed the \"crunch soup\" which they brought before the miso! I have never had this before, not sure if this is unique to Sushi House?? It's like a beefy broth with some noodles and crunchy tempura bits - awesome!!

The green salad was also very awesome, I really liked their dressing as it had a citrus spin on the traditional.

Our main was a few sushi rolls to share - spider, green dragon, kappa, California rolls were all very tasty!

We opted to finish our meal with a coconut sorbet inside of a coconut shell - very refreshing and super cute!!

The owner genuinely thanked us for coming (when has that ever happened??) which was so nice!

All in all, a very solid sushi place in Brampton - we are sure to go back!!"}
{"text":"I visited the Sushi House for dinner with a work colleague.  The decor was very nice, and the wait staff were very attentive.  We both chose one of the 3 dinner specials, which were reasonably priced ($20-25).  The salmon salad was fantastic.  The sushi portion size was extremely generous and very good.  The dinner specials included a small bowl of green tea ice cream, which was also very good and a nice way to end a great meal.

All in all, a very good experience and a much more authentic sushi restaurant than I expected to find in Brampton.  Very much recommended."}
{"text":"This place is right down the st from me! I always go to China a go go right next door so I figured I'd give it a try. I was immediately seated, didn't have to wait long for that. Once I made my order it took the waitress 15 minutes for me to get my appetizers (seaweed salad) they kept bringing me the wrong orders and 30 minutes into being in my seat they finally brought me 1..ONE correct roll! The waitresses and waiters kept going back and forth from one restaurant to another (this place in particular owns 3 different restaurants, right next to each other!) All the orders coming to the tables seemed to be wrong. It was very disorganized and no one seemed what was going on. 45 minutes in I only had 2 rolls brought to my table. I eventually couldn't wait any longer and decided to leave.

The only reason why I might give them a second chance is because the owner apologized and only charged me 10 dollars for some drinks and the rolls that we ordered, they let us take them to go. But they definitely need more help and organization before I give them another chance."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate after my half Ironman race, I had picked this restaurant in advance because they have so many vegetarian options. We got the avocado sushi pizza, the veggie crunch roll and the cupid roll. The food came out in a timely manner and every thing was fantastic, I am so impressed by their selection of vegetarian rolls. I wish other sushi restaurants would take note! As a side note I was also happy to see the ginger wasn't dyed pink. The sushi pizza was delicious but I think they could expand on it, add more toppings, make a spicy veggie option. I will definitely come back here it is just a bit out of the way for me coming from Mississauga. The inside of the restaurant was nicely decorated, I was surprised it wasn't busier when we went but it was a Thursday. I know if I lived nearby I would be getting takeout from here often!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed when I went here. My mom and dad took my sister, her friend, and myself out to dinner. My dad and I got a boat to share for two, they brought us some sort of salmon roll which was amazing, I asked the chef what it was called he said it didn't have a name he just made it lol. 

Everything tasted super fresh and amazing. The staff were so kind! I can't wait to go back again! :)"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite sushi restaurant in Brampton. The sushi is fresh & you can opt for some Korean food as well. Most entrees come with soup , salad and small dishes. 

The dolsot bibimbap is my go to , very authentic and tasty!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, there was a lot of extra salad that was not needed, the service was not that great but at least it was on time. I asked for poke and recieved squid. The must tries here for me is the supreme salmon and the extasy rolls along with the superwhite tuna and garlic salmon niguri. 21$ was a steep price for lunch."}
{"text":"I had the $4.99 sushi takeaway meal from here. I picked the spicy salmon and crunchy crab and it came with a total of 16 pieces and a drink. It was a pretty good meal, especially for the price and much cheaper than other places I've been. You basically get what you pay for so don't expect some high end sushi with a bunch of stuff in it. My only complaint about this is that they charge you 2 extra dollars if you're paying with card and they only tell you about it afterwards."}
{"text":"There's a reason why their take-out special is so cheap & quick. Granted, it's $4.99 for 2 rolls & a pop so I wasn't expecting much but their rolls were way too sloppy. Besides the inconsistent shape & size, the rice itself was very sticky so some pieces stuck together. The fillings (spicy salmon & cali) were mediocre as well, and the rolls were warm. Sushi is not meant to be warm; that just throws everything off. I would rather get a cheap lunch at the Grange instead. 

+1 star for the price & speed of order"}
{"text":"For now I'll rate them with 4 stars.  This place just need to come up with one name.  It's all in conjunction with China A Go Go, Aloha A Go Go and Sushi House.  Just stick to one name!

I knew of the spot where they served Island food and some sushi rolls and now they've expanded to Chinese and All You Can Eat Sushi and Boba which is good for the Eastside.  

I skimmed through the Sushi menu and the Lisa Lisa roll caught my eye so I ordered that with the Seafood Combo (Mahi Mahi and Fried Shrimp) that came with one Meat choice (Short Ribs).

Lisa Lisa Roll is common in most sushi joints and I never really care for it but at this place I think what won me over is the \"crunch\" that was on top.  Something about it.  It was packed on tight on the top of the roll like.... packed snow.  Like fluffy ice!  That's what made it different from other sushi place, the fluffiness of the flakes.  It taste so good.  Plus, the ingredients in the roll look well proportioned.

As for the fish, shrimp and short ribs, it was okay.  Wasn't a fan of how the shrimp was fried because biting into it was super crunchy.  Let's compare it to Panda Express, it's crunchy batter around it but you get a tender bite of the shrimp and that's not what I got here.  More crunchy and an over cooked shrimp.  The short ribs and the Mahi Mahi was just ok for me.  The Mac Salad, I wasn't to impressed with.  It was a little runny for my liking.

As I waited for my to go order I quickly skimmed through their all you can eat sushi menu which looked decent enough to give a try.  Their AYCE menu is decent in price which I think matches what they serve.  


So with that being said, Happy Eatings until next time!"}
{"text":"In fact,I don't want to give any star. The restaurant is really bad?we had all you can eat for lunch, the selection is not that rich as it said on the post outside. The food is not fresh at all, tofu is sour, there is bug in the tea, sushi rice is loose, I think I am eating stir fried rice, not sushi.  When we paid for it , we did not notice the payment, it had counted tips into it, so we paid it for twice! I really don't recommend this place. It's a waste of money."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for some time, but finally, I did. What an amazing place in Brampton. I LOVE Sashimi and I've ordered the 25 piece platter. The presentation and quality of the Sashimi was awesome!! To start, I had a crunch soup and a cup of green tea. 
I was one of the first to arrive on a Monday for lunch but during my meal, the place filled up. From the folks around me, I gathered that everyone was thrilled about their meals. This place has a big menu and choices for every tastebud. I could only recommend this place and will be back plentiful. Well done!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and nice variety of rolls. You have to try the Go Train roll! The clear soup, veggie roll were good too. I like that the rolls come with a small soup. I went twice while staying in Brampton. Tasty food and great service. Even my non-sushi eating family enjoyed it (those that weren't raw, of course)."}
{"text":"Miso soup is excellent
Fresh sashimi 
Great service
Sushi quality is average 
Dynamite roll is good"}
{"text":"Sushi House is a downtown, inexpensive, Canadian style sushi restaurant.  They offer the typical fare of sushi, sashimi, tempura, rolls, and hot meals.  I found the ambiance lacking and therefore cannot speak to accessibility nor gendered bathrooms.  I can say that the space is tight however, so if you use a mobility device, this could be an issue.

I do enjoy the cheap take out specials.  If you pay cash, you can get a bunch of rolls and a drink for about 7$.  I've ordered that before and was happy.  I mean, it's cheap sushi, but it's good.  I've also ordered the sushi burrito HUGE and delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good sushi, for Pittsburgh, for the price. It's not fancy or the most authentic, and even though they mix cuisines, it's a decent place. (That said, it's convenient that the serve noodles and such when friends don't want sushi and I do). Some fish is better than others - their tuna does taste like it's been frozen, but their salmon and white fatty tuna is lovely. The sushi platters come with soup and salad and is plenty of food for the price.

Service is pretty good. The restaurant is large enough that I've never had to wait for a table.

Perhaps, what I like best though, is that they have $5 fruity cocktails all the time. They taste like they're from a mix, almost kool-aidy, but they're strong, and hey, you get what you pay for, and it's delightful."}
{"text":"The food is ok for the price. The guest service is horrible, I walked in after placing a food order and was ignored while they talked at the register even though I was literally 3 inches away (place is tiny). I asked for eel sauce and spicy mayo and they charged me a dollar each; I wouldn't mind paying if they actually would have gave me a good side of it instead they gave me a happy full little container to which I told them nvm I'm not paying a dollar each for that when other places give it for free and more amount. After waiting for my order and finally reviving it I wanted to check it before leaving and the girl said \"it's all there\" umm ok I still want to check hello. The sign that it was empty should have given me a big clue of its bad service but I decided to try it out anyway. Learned my lesson will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a weekday, fish tasted fresh, sushi was rolled nicely and not double layered with rice. The server was very attentive."}
{"text":"I came in thinking \"a sushi house in the east side must taste like crap...\" It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be... But it was still pretty bad. Some rolls were good but most were okay. DO NOT GET MOCHI. they were gross.. I love mochi! But I couldn't force myself to eat it. They came in little plastics like a fortune cookie... Since china Agogo, sushi house and aloha Agogo is all connected, servers got confused a lot. Servers were trying though!"}
{"text":"Loved the sushi here. Presentation is next level. Only qualm is the pricing. There are others that are cheaper though I think you pay for some of the ambience. Liked the way that every party gets their own little spot covered by drapery. Nice for quiet conversations."}
{"text":"In my honest opinion the fish did not taste fresh at all. The tuna was super stringy. Side note I'm also pretty picky with my sushi."}
{"text":"I love that I can order sushi to go here, it's always delicious and they never forget to put chopsticks, soy sauce, or ginger in my bags for me. However when you walk in the door no one is there to greet you... and after standing around for five to ten minutes you are forced to yell for assistance to the cooks...who ignore you, and then magically someone (who doesn't work in the kitchen) pops out to take your order. If they customer service was better they would get 5 stars"}
{"text":"This is pretty much the only place I go to for great sushi in Brampton anymore. Staff, food and wait time is great. The sushi boats are well prepared and incredibly fresh and tasty. If you're looking for sushi in Brampton that isn't pushed at you like a factory and actually prepared as an art form the way it should be... Go here!!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here around 4 pm. The interior of the restaurant has a simple intimate touch to it, at least at the corner I was sitting in. The service was courteous and prompt. It's not noisy inside at all. I ordered a Chirashi dinner with a side of takoyaki. You get a salad and two soups with your dinner ( miso and crunchy noodle). The presentation of the food was excellent. The rice was cooked just right. The fish was frozen, but considering the geography of the location, the quality was not bad at all. When the price is considered, this restaurant is an excellent value. I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"This is an average AYCE sushi restaurant near the Eaton's Centre. A small restaurant, parking isn't free. First impressions, very average. Was seated down nicely, staff are quick and attentive.

Sushi rolls weren't bad at all, but they weren't amazing. Could've been better. Shrimp tempura was okay, chicken teriyaki was mediocre at best.

I think this is an average sushi place if you're in the area and hungry!"}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck sushi here. Especially the $5 takeout special (cash only, otherwise it is a dollar more). Obviously the quality is not as good as say Japango, but $5 for 16 maki pieces and a pop is the best deal around. I've also had AYCE lunch here as well and it was good quality for the price. Service isn't the greatest (what can you expect with AYCE) but I do like how they have a tv inside.

Note - they add 10% service charge to your bill if you are dining in."}
{"text":"I'd never come back to this place again. 

We get the wrong items from other tables and the items that we actually ordered never came to us. 

The sushi are sloppy and too much rice. 

The service was terrible as they slam your food on the table and never apologize for the mistake they made. 

There's 10% service charge on the bill and we almost double tipped. 

Overall the food was unrepresentable and this is definitely the worst sushi place I've eaten at."}
{"text":"$11.99 for All You Can Eat sushi lunch? Hells yes! 

We weren't expecting much at that price point, but we were all really impressed. 

We tried a bunch of different things and no complaints. Took a while for the food to start rolling in, but this place gets mad busy so it's understandable. There were TONS of people getting take-out.  We were still in and out in less than an hour though, with our fat bellies stuffed to the brim.  I was here once before for a salmon teriyaki bento box, which was okay, but honestly, why not just spend the extra couple bucks and go for the all you can eat? I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I walk by this place several times a week and the $4.99 16-piece sushi and drink special always attracts my attention. One side of me is asking how I can resist this deal and the other side is asking how can they offer decent food for that price. 

I ordered a spicy tuna and tempura salmon roll and coke. $5.65 total. Cheaper than McDs. 

The coke was room temp, which sucks. Opened the sushi box and it looks decent. Not polished but not too messy. All this anticipation for this bargain and then I take my first bite. Ugh. Warm. Warm like it's been sitting out all day in the sun. What a disappointment. If it was cold, it would actually be pretty decent. But there is something definitely off when your raw fish, topping sauce, sushi is warm. 

Don't be fooled by the cheap price as it's not worth your stomach trying to digest it."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from Sushi House. I got the $5.99 lunch special with a spicy tempura salmon and avocado sweet potato. Be careful with this place."}
{"text":"As far as all you can eat goes this place is pretty good!
Fast service, good quality ingredients and everything is tasty. They are a little mayo-happy if you ask me though.
They will charge you if you leave food behind too, with a lot of places this is just an empty threat.
Standard dinner price for AYCE around $19"}
{"text":"Do NOT come here for AYCE sushi! Rolls were poor quality and sashimi was still frozen! Of all the food from the ayce menu, the teriyaki/grill stuff was probably the best. They do give you a free avocado smoothie with the meal. 
Most of our order didn't come.. But the food wasn't tasty so we didn't even want to finish it all.. When we asked for the bill, we were told to eat everything left (not even any full rolls. Maybe like 3/8 pieces of 2 types of rolls) or they would add it to the bill. I had always been aware of getting charged for leftover at ayce places but never for such a small amount of food. The dinner ayce price is around $21"}
{"text":"Great sushi!!! The fact that they make it fresh right there is amazing. I only eat sushi so I cant comment on the main courses but, the california roll was good but the spicy tuna was great. Its very cheap aswell 15$ for 12 sushis is a great price in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! the food is great yum yum on that sushi! I give the sushi a 9/10 its very good! I like how they they greet you when you walk in. I highly Recommend the Pastel sushi roll. The service is good, but its understandable, they recently opened and the waiters are starting to know their role to become better at serving. I give them props for trying. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time here and first impression was how friendly and courteous the service was.  We ordered a sashimi boat, two dinner specials and their pina colada sorbet (YUM!).  Their specials are priced very well for both lunch and dinner and both come with their yummy crunchy soup, salad and a drink.
Highly reco you have some green tea merely because they have the best tea cups! 
The sashimi was fresh and buttery.  I'm craving it just thinking of it. 
A great vibe too.  Intimate enough with booths for dates or with the family.
My favourite Japanese restaurant in Brampton so far."}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed this AYCE sushi place! Location is prime as it is near the downtown core. My go-to sushi place is usually Kyoto, only a 5min walk from this place, as it is cheap and quick. But this location comes pretty close with a fairly cheap AYCE price ($14.99 lunch and $21.99 dinner) and a pretty decent variety of sushi to choose from. It isn't usually very busy, the lunch menu has a lot of your basic maki, sushi, and appetizer choices, and the quality is good (in my opinion). The tables are a bit small and the servers forget to fill water even after asking a couple times, but other than that it's a cool sushi place. Their portion sizes in terms of salads and the meat (e.g. chicken teriyaki) are big compared to other sushi places I've been to. I would say it is worth a visit."}
{"text":"I am a fan! Been living in btown for many years and never tried out this place yet. My regret! The sushi is really good. Go for anything salmon related like the salmon salad. OMG it was delicious! The sushi boat was good. A bit boring in my opinion. Maybe change it up so that its not so bland. The rolls were amazing. I would go back for that spicy salmon roll. 

Service was good and I loved the vibe and decor of the place. Very clean. I would gladly come back! 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"Portions are huge, sushi is fresh, dishes are delicious. If I had one quibble, it would be the very, very slow service during the time we visited.

We visited on a Friday evening around 7:00 PM, and it was super busy. I'd recommend calling in and making a reservation, or you may be stuck waiting for a table on high volume Friday/Saturday nights. 

We ordered: a Chicken Katsu appetizer (which may as well have been a main meal, the portion size was quite large), a Gyoza appetizer, and a variety of rolls which came with Crunchy Soup and a Sashimi Salad, both of which were delicious. Overall, the sushi was super fresh, great temperature, and had interesting flavours and textures. The Chicken Katsu was crunchy yet tender, and the sashimi salad that came with our rolls was also really unique. A great meal overall with wonderful flavour.

The place is clean, ambiance is very group/family friendly but still intimate enough because of the way certain tables are set up. Our only issue was that our server was basically non-existent for most of the meal - it took about 25 minutes for her to come over and write down our order (we didn't get the iPads during our meal, just a traditional menu), and another 25 minutes after our meal for her to bring over the bill (we actually had to stand up and look for her so we could hunt our bill down!).

Other than wait issues, the experience overall (especially the food) made for a great Friday night. If we're ever in the area again, we would come back - the food was delicious enough to warrant another visit!"}
{"text":"I used to visit this place about 3 years ago now almost everyday for lunch when I use to work in the area. The reason I used to visit was the following:
1. Value 
2. The crunchy noodle soup which was served first, then the miso soup and then the lunch followed with green tea ice cream. 
3. Vegetarian options. I think there were two.

Not sure how it is now, but thought its worth reviewing since there are so few options in this area for good food."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place as I was craving for sushi.  Tried the all you can eat special (2 hour maximum limit) which is completely fair.  The sushi was mundane, nothing special.  

They completely forgot the banana crepe I ordered during the All You Can Eat selection."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, the server was new and didn't know the menu but that was fine. The owner came out and checked on us and was very friendly. 

We started with crunchy noodle soup, even our 16 month old loved the soup!!!

My husband ordered Bul-Go-Gi lunch and I ordered California roll with shrimp and vegetable tempura. Everything was very fresh, presentation was fantastic."}
{"text":"Got the lunch special. 16 pieces for 5.99 inc drink.
I got avo chicken and yam avo it was pretty good. Toasted sesame seeds are nice on the rolls. It is not bad for a lunch special."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner recently with my partner.

Now I'd like to specify I'm usually a very forgiving restaurant/retail guest/customer, but the customer service here was incredibly poor and left me extremely dissatisfied and angry.

The prices in my budget caught my attention, so we went in. I got bento box #9 which included 4pcs spicy salmon roll, 4 pcs salmon avocado roll (my favourite), 2 pcs salmon sashimi, and 2 pieces tuna sushimi. I opted to substitute for all 4 pieces of sashimi to be salmon. This also came with miso soup and salad.

All in all, the quality of the food was what you could have expected (considering all this cost me $11.50 before tax from what I remember). The miso even reminded me of cheap packaged miso I've bought before at the grocery store. Not the best, but it was edible.

Odd, but closer to the back there was a large TV and \"Say Yes to the Dress\" was blasting through the restaurant.

The service itself was rather unsettling. It feels the entire time like you're being watched like a hawk. There's a lady who paces up and down the restaurant, comes about a foot away from your table (we were at the very front of the restaurant), stares at your meal, and then walks away. Only to repeat this process in another minute or two. There's no subtlety whatsoever, and it almost felt like evaluation rather than someone checking up to see if any empty dishes need be removed. To say the least, it was incredibly uncomfortable and both my partner and I felt crowded and uneasy throughout the entire meal.

What really left me frustrated, though, is that I realized my sashimi was still frozen. I called over the waitress and let her know (very kindly as well, I made sure it was clear I wasn't angry and just wanted to get it replaced with fish that I could actually eat). The waitress wasn't a problem at all and was actually very kind. She brought the food back to the kitchen area (she was going to take the whole box but I just let her know the only issue was the sashimi and put it on a seperate plate). 

A different lady than any mentioned above came back with the same plate abd incredibly condescendingly began to tell me how \"sashimi is served cold\" and \"the fish has to be frozen beforehand to keep it safe\" and that they \"can't microwave it\" because it'll ruin it. All things I knew, because I'm not the idiot that her tone implied, and I know how raw fish works. Absolutely none of which I was contesting. Still very politely, I let her know that I understood this and that my issue was that the sashimi had been served to me STILL FROZEN. I poked the middle and it was solid, extremely cold, and I could feel icy shards within the pieces where some of the outside fish had thawed enough for there to be any give. At that point, her response was to just \"wait for it to thaw out then and eat it last\". I let her go simply because I was starting to get pretty heated about how I was being treated and just wanted to get out of there.

Our waitress came back and I asked her about the tipping process. I wanted to be sure to give her the tip and ensure that nobody else was getting it but her. She then told me that the servers don't get any tips. The tip money goes to the restaurant and they are left with nothing.

Cut to the bill (we just got our stuff packed up so we could leave), and the restaurant even applies an automatic 10% post-tax tip to the bill, with the option of adding your own additional tip. A mandatory 10% tip in addition to what you've already paid for the food to the restaurant, of which the workers don't see a penny. Plus a sneaky way for you to tip twice if you're not so observant.

I added nothing, and for the protection of said waitress, she's a \"friend of mine\" and I \"subtly paid her back\" some \"cash I borrowed beforehand\". Just to make sure she got what was hers.

All in all, terrible experience. I give this one star for the waitresses and the fact that the UNFROZEN food was edible. 

I'll never come back here, no matter the price.

PS: When I ate my thawed sashimi after it left, it tasted super watery with a hint of fish. Cheers."}
{"text":"Very good sushi and service. I had the sashimi combo and the soups they offered along with the salad were great. The fish was very fresh. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre ! Found a piece of hair on my general chicken (all you can eat menu with smaller portion). Server apologized but didn't do anything about it. Ended up giving only 5% tips (shouldn't have given any at all). 
Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"A traditional non-AYCE Japanese restaurant. Great experience.

Sushi house is located on Main St. in Brampton at the North end of the strip. It features a variety of Japanese and Korean dishes with a nice sushi bar and a number of booths and tables. The booths being just wood are not that comfortable, but they are private.

The restaurant features a nice sushi bar at the front with what appears to be actual Japanese itamae (chefs). Dressed in crisp white uniforms and hats, the chefs set the mood for what you will perceive to be an authentic Japanese meal.

There is a variety of dishes and the nigiri sushi and maki rolls are the perfect size. The rice on this occasion seemed a bit \"al dente\" but the fish was fresh and lean. The Nabe-yaki Udon was very good but once again the noodles seemed to be a little undercooked.....either that or they expected one to eat it a bit slower so the cooking would catch up.

I would imagine the booths near the window to be a bit uncomfortable on cold days and a table on the side might be better. Of course the sushi bar would also be a great place to sit. The service is good with a main waitress and another one to back her up. Judging by the \"help wanted\" sign on the window, they may be a bit down on staff. However the food came out around the expected time."}
{"text":"Had the All You Can Eat Sushi Lunch for $19.95. It's was wonderful.
They will even allow you to order 1/2 rolls so you can have more of a variety. 
They have the best seaweed salad in Vegas. 
Simon was our server. He was friendly and had no problem explaining  things to us. 
BTW with the lunch and dinner all you can eat it also gives you appetizers and others items to pick from other than just sushi. 
Lunch- All You Can Eat is $19.95 and you have 60 minutes.
Dinner- All You Can Eat is $23.95 and you have 90 minutes. 
No sharing. (But why would you want to)
Remember that you can order 1/2 rolls so you can sample different things. 
They can charge for extra uneaten food. So order what you think you'll eat or less and then place a second, third or even fourth order. 
Will certainly be back."}
{"text":"We travelled far to visit this restaurant and it was worth the drive! We were surprised to see how crowded it was on a Thursday evening. 

The biggest problem was trying to figure out what to order. It had been a while since I had sushi so everything on the menu looked great. I decided to start off with some hot sake to help inspire me. 

Ordered the Sushi Sashimi dinner. It was fresh and divine. The tuna was delicious. Three different varieties and literally melted in your mouth. The complimentary miso soup was a bonus. 

We finished off our delectable meal with some tempura green tea ice cream. I had promised myself would have just a few bites but ended up wolfing down the entire portion. 

I can't recommend this place enough and will definitely visit again the next time I'm in the area. Service was excellent. Perfect recommendations and everything with a cheery smile."}
{"text":"I was there on a Friday for lunch.  The food was great, but the service was a bit slow for a workday.  I had a sushi lunch combo for under $15.  The fish was great, cool and a decent size.  My only issue was the lack of wait staff.  For a busy Friday, I was unable to get a refill on my tea and a bit of extra ginger.  I would go back."}
{"text":"So glad this place opened up! It's so nice to have a sushi place that is a 3 minute drive from home! We're major sushi seekers and would have sushi every day if we could. This is our 2nd  favorite sushi place in the city. It's quiet, intimate, and has has very modern Japanese decor. Their AYCE is a good price and they don't pressure you to eat fast, we actually showed up like 2 hours before closing so I was expecting them to rush us out but they were really relaxed. Everything was very fresh and there were some pretty unique rolls. Really the only reason I'm giving it a 4 is because they're not open late enough. I'm used to sushi places that stay open until like 2 AM. If you get a chance try their yellow tail nigiri, SO MUCH FLAVOR!"}
{"text":"Another mediocre sushi experience. The fish didn't taste foul or old, but it also just didn't taste like anything. I partly blame myself for getting sushi on a Sunday knowing full well that I'm going to be eating at least day old fish, but I also partly blame Sushi House for not doing much of anything to make up for my mistake. I got a spicy tuna, house maki, and a spider. 

The spicy tuna had no spice and also no tuna flavor - I use spicy tuna rolls as my gauge for sushi places, and this has to be the second worst I've eaten (worst overall was at the sushi buffet on McKnight, but that's a whole different mistake). The house maki wasn't too bad, except the ratio of fake crab meat to tuna was swayed much too far toward fake crab. The spider roll was the best of the three, and the only roll I would consider buying again - good, creamy avocado and a delectable soft shell crab cooked just right. Also, each roll was $6+, which is way too much for maki of the basic variety.

I'd driven by this place a bunch of times in my year of Pittsburgh adventures, and really if I would've just continued driving by tonight and gone hungry I wouldn't have complained a whole lot. If you decide to give this sushi a try, make sure they supply you with enough soy sauce to make it through the experience, as that is going to be the most flavor you'll get from the majority of their fish.

PS, the two men working there were prompt and pleasant so kudos to them - now if they could only fix their product..."}
{"text":"The food was great. Fresh and flavorful. I had the sushi combo dinner - salmon teriyaki (good), shrimp & veggie tempura (very good), salad (very good), and California Rolls (ok - too much tobiko [fish eggs] for my liking). The service was friendly and the food came out FAST. The presentation of the food was well done. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Best Sushi I have ever eaten!!! When in Brampton I always stop in!! Great Service and Food!"}
{"text":"My tour of sushi houses continues.  We drove an extra 20 minutes out of the way just to come here.  It was worth it.  This sushi house is situated next to the Bramptom Go station.  So parking is a plenty.  

The food was fresh and accurate for what we ordered.  The restaurant was not busy at the time when we came in - well it was half full for a weekend.  We had our two kids with us and were served pretty promptly.

We were surprised to find the bill not as expensive as we would have expected.  :)"}
{"text":"First sushi restaurant I've been to in Brampton and it was simply divine! My boyfriend and I had M.J as our waitress and she was so tentative and prompt and very sweet. We shared the lobster tempura, edamame beans and legendary dragon roll to start- all of which were delicious. I had the shrimp teriyaki dinner and it came out with a mountain of shrimp, it was crisp, sweet, and the crunchy veggies underneath added great texture and freshness! My boyfriend devoured the bulgogi dinner. It was truly a great meal and a great atmosphere. Add in some hot sake and some wine and it was a perfect evening. Definitely recommend to both sushi lovers and those new to Japanese cuisine!"}
{"text":"Had the dinner combo #10. It was delicious, the staff was very friendly and quick, the restaurant was clean.

The combo was about $20 before tax. With a pop the meal came to $24.50 after tax. It was the perfect amount of food. I'm not much of a fan of miso soup in general so that didn't do much for me. The crunch soup and salad were both delicious. The sushi tasted fresh and was well crafted. The spicy tuna roll was my favourite although the dynamite roll was great too, had the perfect amount of spicy sauce on it too. Sometimes sushi places tend to overcoat their sushi. 

Would go back in a heartbeat. The lunch menu looked great and the food was delicious and well proportioned, especially for under $25."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with coworkers since it's one of the only AYCE sushi's in the area.  We found that the key is to come around 11am for lunch or else the place gets extremely packed and the service is super slow.  We also learned that all orders must be placed in your first round of orders or you risk not being able to get your second order filled by the end of your lunch hour.

The lunch price is great for the quality of sushi as mentioned by a previous reviewer, which is why we keep coming back.  The sushi is of good quality, there is a moderate selection at lunch and they don't give too much rice.  Like most other AYCE sushi places, sashimi is not served during lunch (not sure about dinner though).

The service is horrendous though.  They have the typical problem where they just simply don't fulfill your entire order, and the servers have to be constantly harassed if you want everything to come out.  They'll make you place a second order if you keep asking where your (insert missing dish here) is.  If you're placing an order in between 11:45 and 12:15, expect a 20 minute wait for anything to come out.  And if you see cops doing a take-out order, the entire restaurant will not get any orders until the cops get their lunches.

But honestly, it is the best sushi I've eaten in the area, all the other sushi restaurants that I've tried in the Queen/University area is garbage so relatively this place is not that bad."}
{"text":"This place is great. Decent prices and very good food, actually! The sushi combo and salmon specials are good! Michu wasn't great... :( They were out of tempura ice cream. :( Other than that, worth checking out for good sushi. Obviously there is better out there but this is not bad!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE it here. So many unique options to experience. The service is spectacular!! It's very clean and beautiful inside entire restaurant including facilities. Would recommend to everyone. 
Vegan and vegetarian options available I go all the time!"}
{"text":"Went for all you can eat and they seated us far away from the kitchen and no one came by to ask how we were doing. We had to call them over each time. They missed a bunch of orders and the fish itself tasted bad. The white tuna looked like spam and had a strange texture. Plus they tacked on a 10% gratuity onto the bill automatically. I do not recommend at all."}
{"text":"Nothing to complaint but nothing really special here. I came here based on all the amazing reviews. The sashimi and sushi is okay. I don't find there is a big difference to those AYCE restaurant.  Pretty average japanese sushi place but probably one of the best one Brampton."}
{"text":"Fairly average selection, but the tempura was very crunchy and fresh - everything was above average. The service was very good, and for the location it's pretty cheap. The music was pretty loud, it didn't bother me, but keep that in mind if it will bother you. They do charge an automatic gratuity, so make sure you do not double tip. 

I almost want to rate higher because of the low reviews, I really don't get it - everything was adequate if not above average. $16 for ayce lunch downtown is very fair, many places will charge around $20-$25 for older, not as good food.

Definitely will be eating here again."}
{"text":"Whoever gave this place great reviews, clearly has NEVER tried sushi before. I've had millions of different sushi places, and this is by far the WORST sushi I've ever had and the service was the WORST service I ever had as well. The crust tempura crumbs felt gluey and sticky and were practically un-edible. On top of that, the waiter brought EVERY order to the wrong table. The whole restaurant was giggling and laughing and then it just got annoying. We had to tell him which table to go every time. And no matter what you order or ask the waiter, he has NO idea what you are saying and has to get someone else from the back. Be it soy sauce or spicy mayo...he's NEVER heard of it. In the end, we even asked for the bill and he's like \"what? bill?\" so we said \"yah you know, the bill so we can pay?\"...he then proceeded to bring out the chef to us, and we had to order the bill from him. Whether you speak english or not...HOW THE HELL can you be a waiter in Canada if you don't know what \"the bill\" is. 
WOW. WORST place I've ever eaten. If you go here because it's cheap and 11.99 you are WASTING your money. Go pay a couple bucks more...or go somewhere even cheaper."}
{"text":"More like 3.5*.  I'll round it up 'cause the main waitress was really sweet!

It was the better the first time I went for lunch, but then again, I ordered different (maybe the wrong) stuff.  This time 'round, I ordered SD9, a variety of maki as opposed to nigiri + a coupla smaller rolls of maki (lunch).

I've never had sashimi from Sushi House, so I can't comment on that.  Nigiri and smaller maki rolls are good.

Service:  At first, I thought that they should implement a buzzer system, as they have some rooms to one side of the restaurant...which are probably easy to miss.  However, the waitresses did come to check-in on us every so often.  Waitresses were nice 'n sweet and provided everything that I requested.

What I wasn't impressed with this time were their larger maki rolls, re:  Dynamite, Spider.  They weren't rolled tight enough, pieces of rice would crumble off, and the soft shell crab looked double-fried (very dark brown), and it tasted fishy.  I'd say that the Spider was the least favourite roll that I ordered.

And Kani rolls in the SD9?  Pure filler.

A definitely bonus is that most meals come with Crunch Soup (delicious), a Miso Soup, Salad, & ice cream at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"I have not been here in a few months. The place has gone downhill. I got their sushi lunch special. It has gone up in price again. It is now $9 for the sushi lunch. I can understand prices going up due to inflation; however, the hostess is still rude, and the sushi rolls are meh...something is different. There are several other sushi restaurants down the street. It's time that we have them a try. 

They may have lost me as a customer. I usually pick up lunch for several of my work colleagues at the same time."}
{"text":"Their take-out lunch special is priced right, but their service is wildly inconsistent.  During lunch time, it's a gong show.  Over crowded.  Servers yelling over people.  

I've asked for no wasabi, only to find them dropping a giant glob of it on top of the food.

If you're a masochist looking for a good take-out lunch deal, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much on the outside, but this place is surely a surprised little find. Their sashimi are fresh, rolls are done perfectly. They only have two servers serving the most oddly shaped restaurant I've seen, but both of them are very friendly.
What a way to start 2016!"}
{"text":"No big complaints but it's really nothing special. We ordered the salmon and avocado roll ($4.95) which tasted comparable or almost not as good as the sushi you would get at Ocean's or T&T - except it costs more. We also had one of the dinner combos with spicy tuna, spicy salmon and dynamite ($20) and it was just OK. The spicy tuna was the best of the 3.
Service was efficient and friendly and the restaurant space is nice."}
{"text":"I came to buy the takeout special. They gave me fucking scraps. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of those places that you don't expect much from. But to my surprise this place was awesome! By far the best thing here is the people. I loved the hospitality and the warm welcome I got when I entered the door. They even gave me a free crunch soup while I waited for my food. Any place that can show that kind of hospitality has a spot in my books.

The sushi itself was delicious as well. No complaints, just straight up good food. I would highly recommend coming through to try it out if you are in a mood for sushi."}
{"text":"I got the take out special here for $5.99 that includes 2 rolls of your choice and a pop. I had the spicy salmon and crunchy salmon skin and they were not bad for the price. It's a good deal, if you pay cash it's $6.80 including tax. It's a lot of food for the price but you can't expect anything exceptional. I would say it's the same quality as boxed sushi from the mall. I would definitely come again for the take out special!"}
{"text":"If food bill is under 20$ they don't accept debit or credit card. Our bill was more, but it was something I noticed on signs inside the place.

The Sushi was all right - nothing spectacular. What stood out was the grumpy waitress, who only decided to be polite at the end of our meal. The speciality sushi rolls were really small (bad) and rolled tightly (good). The taste was alright and the fish felt fresh, other than that it was okay, wouldn't go out of my way to return, though. Will try other spots."}
{"text":"Ok.. I think I've found a true competitor for Daisuki sushi in Markham and it's Sushi House in Brampton. I dont venture out this way, but I was in Caledon for work and yelped a sushi spot cuz I don't know the area and I saw this place had 4.5 stars. So I found my way here. 

MAN AM I GLAD I DID. The decor was fresh, clean and simple and very inviting. The cooks and waitress were very courteous and attentive and friendly. 

I ordered my food, and was brought a complimentary \"crunchy soup\". WOW. Tempura flakes with soba noodles in a consume.. SO GOOD. So different!

Then the green salad came.. and instead of the usual thousand island/creamy dressing on the salads these days, it was a really fresh, citrus dressing with an orange taste! so zesty and fresh. What a welcome change!

Next came chap che. the texture was AMAZING. It was a bit too salty for my liking.. but still very nice. 

Next came the miso soup. Not too salty, just right and different than other restaurants I've been to. It was very delicate. I loved it. 

Following were my maki orders. The fire  maki, dynamite roll, california roll and kappa maki. EVERYTHING was so fresh. I really really enjoyed every bite of every roll. 

The complimentary red bean ice cream was so good! Usually the ice cream just tastes like ice cream, but these guys.. their red bean ice cream actually had red bean in it and I could taste the fibre/grittiness of the red bean in every.. bite.. AMAZING.

I cannot say enough about my first experience at Sushi House. I promised myself that I will have to return here another day. I live nowhere near this place at ALL... but I will make the journey another time to come out and eat here again.

WOW. WOW. WOW.

That is all I have to say. 

These guys are the real deal. Masters at sushi making."}
{"text":"Service was super slow..... Came around 845pm with a friend for a late dinner for AYCE. The restaurant was pretty empty and we got our food pretty slowly. The servers didn't even refill up my tea and my friends water until I asked so. Sushi bar had 3 people and yet they could barely handle 4 customers in the restaurant. I thought the food was going to be delicious since it was taking so long, but even that disappointed me. The sashimi was sliced sloppy, the rice was really bad. Rice fell apart. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Another disappointing all-you-can-eat sushi place.

They use the lowest quality fish, rice seasoning is very dull.

No need for a review, just stay away."}
{"text":"I am a big sushi lover and would try almost any sushi place at least once in hopes to find that hidden gem. Well, let me tell you - this is NOT it. 
I've tried the Sushi House's all-you-can-eat with a friend and the take out. Here is my take on it:

Place: Chinatown style ugly. Plastic, plastic and some more plastic. There is nothing on the tables but the menu. 

Service: horrendous. No, seriously, really, really bad. Not only they are not welcoming, attentive or even polite, they actually discuss the customers among themselves in Mandarin (my friend speaks the language). If you think that the giggling and glaring is about you, it's probably is! 
As was said before, don't expect your entire order, don't expect it within less than 20 minutes and don't expect a smile with it.  

Sushi: I understand that fish is expensive and rice is not, but this \"restaurant\" takes it a bit beyond the frugal. Someone should tell them that the fish for sushi is supposed to be of a \"sushi-quality\", not the cheapest stuff you can find. Your \"sushi\" (maki, rolls and anything in between) will be build out of lots of rice, tempura scraps and a tiny-tinny amounts of undeniable fish, which is not very fresh either.

Recommendation: do not waste your money and taste buds here. If you want AYCE, go to Baldwin St. at Sushi Ya (not the best, but way better than this dump). Want cheap take-out: go to Galleria Sushi at the Village by the Grange (Dundas/McCoul), they have the same $5.50 cash only take-out, but way better."}
{"text":"Loved it. No complaints at all.

Pros - quick service, delicious food, friendly staff
Cons - nothing"}
{"text":"This place is probably the best place you can get the most authentic and great tasting sushi. I have come to this place many times and it just gets better and better.

The staff is super nice and they are really easy going in substituting combo items into another item without any additional cost. 

I tried many sushi places hoping I can find something better then Sushi House but as of now I have not."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and the wait time was surprisingly short compared to other restaurants I've been to although this could be because I was having fun.

It really gives an atmosphere of an authentic Japanese restaurant which I think adds to the experience. 

The staff was very helpful when I asked for recommendations since my friends and I did not know what to get.

One thing is that the quality may not justify the price for most, in my case I don't think it did. But if you are looking for a sushi place to chow down on then this would be great!"}
{"text":"Limited menu but the food is very good.

The sushi is fresh and tempura is well done... very light batter.

You order off an Ipad which seems to be the norm nowadays.  The images and descriptions are accurate as to what you will get.
If you have yet to order off an ipad... the staff is quite friendly and willing to show you... so ask.

Decor is modern and staff is friendly.

Their busy time seems to be around 7pm.

This place also offers take out."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my cousin a few months back. 

I ordered the chirashi and for sure it has been the freshest sashimi I have ever had. My cousin ordered the bibimbap and she truly enjoyed it. For lunch we spent under $25! As a student this is a very good price!
The presentation for the meals made the lunch experience that much greater!

As for the service, it was great and I couldn't really complain about it. It is a place to visit here in Brampton."}
{"text":"When a sign says the sushi take-out special is only $4.99, it's probably a good indication that the sushi isn't high quality and won't be very good. 

Instead of listening to my instincts, I decided to try it out anyway. 

I walked in and was told to go to the back if I wanted take out. It was lunch time and there was a line of people putting in their orders for the special. I knew the line meant one of two things: 1. This place is really good, or 2. People are cheap (it was the latter). 

As I waited in line, a gentleman came by to take orders. Efficient, that's good. 

I asked for the spicy tuna rolls and the chicken and avocado rolls then was immediately ushered to the front to pay, despite people being in front of me. While I was paying, they called out my name and handed me my food. Wow, that was quick. 

As for the food? Terrible. My spicy salmon wasn't spicy. The chicken and avocado were drenched in some horrible sauce. The rice was sticky causing all the rolls to stick to each other and rip apart when you try to pick one up. Also, the can of Nestea I got with my sushi was warm. Gross. 

Piece of advice: take your $5 to the pizza place next door."}
{"text":"In the middle of our dinner, a homeless person just walked in, wandered around asking for food and without consent, she took some food directly from a customer's plate and left. Instead of stopping this behaviour, all the waiters and restaurant staff just stared at her and didnt say anything!! I know they can't prevent this sort of incidents from happening, but they should have asked her to leave when she started bothering every customer of the restaurant! Also, they messed up our order, gave us the wrong dish, and forgot to bring another dish completely. The waiters don't seem friendly, and don't seem to know what they are doing. It took them a long time to figure out that they gave us the wrong dish after we pointed out. Worst dining experience ever! Will never come here again!"}
{"text":"Went there with my family and we ordered 2 $9.99 bento boxes, an 8.99 red dragon roll, a 11.99 unagi don and 10.99 unagi and salmon nigiri. Being from Vancouver, we had high expectations for sushi, and this place did not disappoint. For the bentos and don, they came with salad and soup that were both delicious and with generous portions. The food itself was incredibly filling, the variety was good, and everything was well cooked. The red dragon roll was huge and very delicious, and you might want to ask for a side of mayo to complement! Most of all, the service was very prompt and excellent. The owners made very thorough explanation of the menu. This is rare to see at a sushi place back home. If we're in the area again we'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"2 words to describe this place: STINGY and DISGUSTING. If I could give this establishment 0 stars, I would. I only came here bc it was nearby and I needed to grab food ASAP. 

The whole restaurant straight up smelled like a urinal, which is concerning considering the fact that they are preparing raw fish... it was so strong that my friend almost puked. 

There was barely any fish whatsoever in the rolls -- the only bits I could find were the size of rice grains... the \"maki rolls\" were literally just thick balls of rice and tempura bits. I was only given 1 soy sauce packet which quickly got soaked up by the tempura bits.

NOTE: The takeout special is now $6.99 + $1 if you're paying with debit/credit. Definitely not worth the $9 after tax. There are tons of options next door that would be worth your money."}
{"text":"Fave sushi restaurant in the area!
Service is on point! Nice waitresses & very accommodating! 

Price is on point too (during lunch- which is 11pm to 4pm. They offer lunch combos which are priced from $8-$13)

But it gets pricier at dinner for the same items. So make sure you try and go for Lunch.

Ordered all different kind of bentos and I MUST SAY THAT BEEF KALBI BENTO was the best of them all. Tender and flavourful!!!! You can also ask if you want your tempuras to be all shrimp or all vegetables (at no extra charge).  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Ok sushi, all you can eat was very typical, and not as good as the ones up in Markham. Nothing really that enjoyable about this place but nothing really wrong either. There are other places nearby that are better, and worse."}
{"text":"An amazing restaurant. 
We actually showed up a few minutes early before opening and we were kindly seated. Minutes later our drinks were taken. We ordered the sushi pizza with salmon on top and as strange as it sounds, it was actually very tasty. 
For dinner I ordered a variety of nigiri which consisted of Pacific Salmon, Yellow-Tail, Tuna, Mackerel, Octopus, Scallop, Eel (Unagi), Sweet Shrimp and Ikura. The nigiri was perfectly formed with the perfect amount of rice and fish on top. Every piece tasted fresh and absolutely phenomenal. The only thing that was a slight disappointment was they didn't have some items I really looked forward to. Such as Anago (Saltwater Eel), Fluke, Sea Bass, or Toro. Which is perfectly fine because typically those are seasonal ingredients. 
Then we went ahead and ordered a couple rolls. The Legendary Dragon Roll and Tiger Cat Roll. Very nicely rolled, presented, and very tasty. 
The lady ordered the Bulgogi which surprisingly coming from a Japanese/Sushi restaurant was very tasty and the beef was very nicely marinated. 
We ended with their pina colada sorbet in a pineapple shell which was tasty and very cool looking. Overall, this was a great experience and I would gladly return and recommend. 
I also would like to point out that our Server who was such an absolute pleasure which such a big smile is actually the owner with her husband who was also behind the sushi bar. A huge thanks to Sharon for making the experience so much better."}
{"text":"My wife and I just went there for lunch and I'm currently back at work trying to hold back not throwing up.  This place was completely terrible.  We were denied sitting in a booth and then got nudged and shoved at our table for the duration of our meal from the students snaking their way to the take-out area in the back.  The ancient old man making guttural grunting noises to himself non-stop next to us who was constantly blowing his nose in his own bare hand certainly didn't help much either.  How was the food you ask?  We each ordered the $12.99 'a la carte' sushi lunch and couldn't stomach it (what we 'did' order that is... some of it didn't actually arrive at our table).  I love sushi, but I don't think I'll be getting it for a couple of weeks while I try to cleanse myself of this heinous aftertaste.  Sushi house not only managed to coat the interior of my mouth with a frothy fishy scum, but also tattoo my brain with nauseous imagery of hundreds of dead fish washed up on a polluted Toronto shore, no doubt being collected by their kitchen staff to be served for lunch.  Oh, and if paying by debit, make sure you call the waitress over to help her get you through the 'tipping function' on the machine (tipping is already included in the price).

On the plus side, the after-dinner mints were amply 'minty' (ask for a handful as you'll probably need a lot of them after your meal)."}
{"text":"Just ate lunch here. This place should be called all you can eat 'rice', not sushi.

I was served large mounds of warm rice with a thin sliver of fish on top. 

Gross."}
{"text":"After reading Sergey's review, I stalled coming here for a while.  I'm glad I decided to take a chance on my health and try this place.  My stomach loves me at the moment.  We ordered a large sashimi platter to go and I will have to say it's possibly the best sashimi platter in the GTA West I've tried so far. 

With an incredibly sweet and motherly tone on the phone, they took our order and told us they only needed 20 minutes to put together the platter.  Most places usually request 1 hour at least.  Bonus points for them for being quick!  When we went there, we saw the voice on the phone and she was a very lovely woman who clearly just wanted us to be happy with our order.  Though we haven't taken a bite yet at that point, my stomach was already salivating. 

The sushi chef did a great job and for those who are uninitiated with the whole head to tail of sushi, this sushi chef is not afraid to show you how fresh the sashimi is.  We had a great wide variety of fresh and tasty pieces.  Tuna, tuna tataki (with it's mind blowing smokiness), salmon, wild salmon (it's leaner and more red but it's also a sweeter tasting meat than the usual Atlantic fat salmon), ika (squid and it wasn't gooey!! It was clean, smooth and wrapped around a creamy avocado), hamachi, ama ebi (real raw shrimp with the heads!! that's what I mean by fresh... heads included but they're detached), tai, white tuna, and another fish that I'm not familiar with but tasted like butter but looked like mackeral (?).  

The presentation was top notch and it really showed the chef cared about his product.  Some pieces weren't so large but the quality more than made up for this.  The best thing was that this is the most affordable platter in the GTA West.  I've compared this to Toshi, Sushi in Sushi, Dai Ichi, Sushi 4 Me, Hinote, JJ, Sushi Tei, Kumai, and Prince Sushi.  Honestly, Sushi House beats them all for flavour, presentation, price, variety and quality.  Only Toshi comes close but they don't have a full sashimi platter and they're more expensive.

I honestly will keep coming back for more and try other items.  This is my new go to place for Japanese!  Like I said, my stomach is so happy with me at the moment and it's craving to go back."}
{"text":"Most definitely one of my favourite sushi places in Brampton! It is not AYCE which is one thing that I like about it. Each order is made for you at the time of order, the food is fresh and delicious. The staff is very friendly and cater to your needs, they are also pretty easy going with substitutions. I have been to sushi house a bunch of times and I have never left hungry, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Absolute best sushi place in Brampton. If you want high-quality sushi and you don't want to settle for sub-par all you can eat sushi - you definitely get your money's worth here at Sushi House.

I got the Chirashi Dinner which is an assortment of sashimi (sliced raw fish) on a bed of rice. Great portions, thick cuts and very fresh fish. Didn't think I could get this quality of sushi in Brampton no less.

My sister got the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap - A Korean dish  served in a hot stone bowl made with a bed of rice, mixed veggies, beef and fried egg. (This is the spicy version, they have a non-spicy one too). Such a cool experience for her because she never tried it before. I told her if she liked a bit of crunch, to let the rice get really hot in the stone bowl and then mix. She got too impatient and mixed right away. We both enjoyed the bi bim bap, we wished for a bit more meat though.

The dinners come with two kinds of soup - crunch soup (which had bits of tempura and some noodles) and miso soup. 

I've never had crunch soup before. It was delicious, not too salty and I wondered how the tempura bits maintained their crunch in the hot soup. The miso wasn't your typical all-you-can-eat, diluted, dirty-water-tasting soup. It was actually the first time I enjoyed miso. Don't be fooled by the handful portion - I was verging on satiated after these yummy soups. 

I substituted my small green salad for an avocado salad and it was about $4 more - but well worth it. I almost wish I didn't get it because it was two times bigger than my sister's green salad but it was very tasty. Very fresh, the dressing was light and the avocado was also perfectly ripe. 

For dessert I tried out ice cream mochi for the first time and our server didn't lie. It was yummy! The green tea was my favourite. 

I also got the frozen fruit sorbet served in a fruit shell. I was torn between pineapple and lemon and got the lemon instead. It was perfectly tart, but I scraped too close the the actual lemon and the rind made it bitter.


Wonderful experience, will definitely be back for more. The servers are so sweet and when I couldn't finish my dinner the chefs re-plated my dinner in a to-go box. 
I'm surprised this place isn't more packed on a Saturday night - YOU HAVE TO GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Good sashimi. The fish tasted fresh. Great value. Great selection and they were very friendly. Also cool location to eat."}
{"text":"A brief search on Google showed me that this recently open sushi restaurant appears to be an reincarnation of Yuki Sushi Restaurant (address and phone number the same).

They offer AYCE sushi for lunch and dinner, with dinner at $17.99 (a dollar cheaper than the AYCE down the street). We at first just wanted to order a la carte, but my friend wanted everything on the menu and we ended up doing the buffet instead. 

We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of sushi here, as we were not expecting anything good. Their portions are perfect for ayce, as their handrolls are half the size as regular handrolls, allowing us to have room for other yummy makis and hot foods. We particularly enjoyed their spicy salmon rolls that are smothered in yummy spicy mayo sauce, teryaki beef and avocado rolls, tempura vegetables, and enoki mushrooms rolled in beef. 

Unfortunately, some of our orders were missed, even though we didnt order that much (just the two of us)--the fried rice never came, the beef short ribs were out, and no green tea ice cream (what!).

Sure, there are way better ayce sushi places out there for this price point, but this was pretty good for a random selection."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for the $4.99 takeout deal. 
The take out deal is good for its price since it includes 16 pieces and a drink.

Went for the ayce options just to try it out and there seems to be not as much options of sushi.

The rice is really soft so it falls apart really easy and for some reason they added a lot of wasabi. Waitresses were mostly standing there and the music was way too loud.

The final bill had already included a 10%tip.

12.99$ + tax + 10%tip makes this AYCE 16.15$ per person for only 90 minutes and a low assortment of food"}
{"text":"We had a great overall experience when we visited this restaurant on Saturday. It was completely empty when we arrived at 12:30 but by the time we left - it was packed. The server/hostess was very friendly. Although her English was spotty, what she lacked in vocabulary, she made up with enthusiasm.

We were started off with complimentary crunchy soup which was new to all of us.  I don't know what was in it but it was delicious! Between the three of us, we followed that with a large lunch special: dynamite roll, California roll, and tempura, as well as a Kamikaze roll, spicy salmon roll and a go train roll (really good, especially if you're not into spicy food). All was very delicious and fresh. 

Finally, we ordered their specialty fruit sorbets for desert. It was heavenly delicious - and as the server pointed out to me later, no sugar added. So, I didn't even feel that guilty about eating it! Plus who doesn't love a sorbet presented in the shell of an actual fruit? That's what I thought."}
{"text":"Worst place for all you can eat sushi. I have only been there once and will be the last one on my life. Slow services and poor food quality for all you can eat. A lot more all you can eat sushi are better than this one. I don't recommend anyone to get sushi here!"}
{"text":"I went here a few times just for their $4.99 take out deal with 2 rolls & a pop, it was definitely not bad, you're getting what you pay for. The 2 rolls fill me up very quickly and I always get the tuna and spicy salmon rolls. Recommended a few of my friends to this place, they thought it was not bad as well"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! The service was fast and the price was right (I payed about $21 for all you can eat-until 4pm for 60min) the sushi was really good! I will go again, but if anyone is like me I'm not a big fan of cream cheese and spicy tuna! Lol a big chunk of their sushi roll menu has cream cheese  and spicy tuna but I'm sure they can modify, try it out!"}
{"text":"I came here about 3 months ago with my friend and we both enjoyed it! I liked the hot saki, the sushi, the shashimi I liked it all! I felt it was fresh and I liked the dining experience although the chef kept staring at me hehe (maybe he liked me) lol I would come back again."}
{"text":"Not a bad restaurant, but not worth going out of your way for. 
Between the time we got a table to when we actually received some service must have been 10 minutes, which would have been longer if we hadn't waved down a server and made a face of frustration a couple of times. 
Prices were on the high side and as for the decor, they made it pretty high-endish with private rooms, each consisting of around 2-3 tables.
I asked for the chirashi bowl and a friend got the soba noodles. The food took a pretty long time to make, around 20 minutes! While waiting they served us some complimentary seafood broth soup with crispy noodles, which was quite flavourful. Once the food arrived I was in shock by the size of the chirashi. I've never seen such a huge serving of that dish before, where I think it could be good enough for 2 people. However my friends soba noodles were a an average size, a bit too small for my appetite. As for me, I had to remove some of my rice but managed to finish all of the sashimi. I did however find that my meal was a bit bland compared to others that I've had. 
One thing I did appreciate was that when I asked them to add extra ginger into my meal, they definitely obliged and piled it on!
I didn't really get much of a reaction from the soba noodles, other than that they were fine and nothing exceptional.
So basically, I wouldn't say that I'll never go again, but it wont be my first choice for a sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Not the fanciest sushi joint in the GTA nor the best fish products, but definitely one of the most convenient and budget-friendly. Conveniently located corner Dundas and University, just off the St. Patrick subway station, it's close enough for young professionals working (or interning for free...) in the area to grab a quick and affordable bite at lunch. Two options are available: à la carte or AYC, but I'd recommend the first one unless you have a really, really big appetite: bento boxes are less than $10! However, the best deal durug lunchtime is 4.99 for 2 rolls (makis; 16 pieces) and a drink, cash only. Eat in and take out both possible. Service is quick and friendly, so you won't need to lineup for long when busy. Sushi varieties are basic, but varied enough to keep it interesting--I especially like the chicken-avocado roll when I crave a healthy lunch (I ask the staff to skip the teriyaki sauce!). Fish is decently fresh and rolls are made to order, as usual. Recommended for busy Yelpers on a budget but who still want to eat somewhat healthy."}
{"text":"Amazing Spider Roll was truly amazing!  The sushi rice was fresh and delicious.  Fast and friendly service.  Everything was great except for dem bruk up seats all ripped up and ting and minimal parking."}
{"text":"Had no idea that this spot even ex histed. After passing it various times, my boyfriend and I finally stopped in & THANK GOODNESS WE DID! We were not even hungry so we only had 3 rolls. The Steelers Roll was amazing & the Spicy Spider roll was to die for!! I will definitely be returning once I learn how to conquer those hills of Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Lunch take-out menu is very good value.  Food is mediocre for a sushi place. If you simply need a sushi fix then this place is ok."}
{"text":"I've been here the last two years for Christmas day dinner and it was great! But went last Saturday around 4pm and it was disappointing to say the least. The rice on our sushi was the size of two golf balls and the slices of fish were super thin with rips. Took them a long time to bring us our order. The wait staff seemed more concerned about hanging out at a table together and talking than serving customers. Probably not coming back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn bad.  Maybe they deserve 1 1/2 starts.

I tried the AYCE, and almost all the items were pretty poor.  One or two were OK.  The California rolls were among the worse I've ever had.  The Avocado was terribly mushy and gross.

I don't even remember now which of the other items were bad, but I'll never go there again.

The service was meh.  I often waited a long time for another drink.  And one of the cans of coke they brought me was room temperature.  One of the women working there who seemed to be the 'boss' just didn't seem to care.  Staff sometimes just standing around wasting time.

Avoid this place.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"This restaurant must be doing something right because I tried it when I used to live in Brampton- and it's still alive. Maybe a possibility is that there aren't many Jap places in this city. 

The restaurant is divided by booths which is nice for some privacy. And in another area, there are more seating spaces. The decor is nice and welcoming. 

We were offered two types of mini soups which was hot. I liked it since I felt frozen. The small was small and light to taste. 

The menu had Jap and Korean dishes. I haven't had a beef bibimbap in awhile so I decided to go with that for $14. 

I asked for well done fried egg but I felt it was a bit burned. The most disappointing part was the cold tiny portion of the beef. Two bites and it's gone. I'm not much of a meat eater, but it was such a disappointing aspect of the meal. Indeed one wants to get their money's worth. 

My partner liked his bulgogi-tempura bento box. Lots of veggie tempura and the four piece of sushi is a nice touch. 

Verdict: It's a nice place but I would order something else if I'm in the Brampton area. Service was good. Just to to improve on portions of food. Thanks."}
{"text":"Customer Service might not have thee best. But the 3 rolls we had was Las Vegas Roll (which was my fav out of the 3), Tai Ming (2nd fav) and then the Siu Ming. All delicious rolls. Worth a shot."}
{"text":"The owner of the place isn't the best at customer service, at times she's very slow at waiting tables. There's something about her every time I come here that screams all fake and smiles when we're at the front paying, and only when we're at the front paying.
However, this is simply the best sushi in Brampton there is that isn't AYCE. The chefs provide immaculate presentation and provide the freshest cuts of fish.
The crunchy soup is what I recommend at this place, really delicious.
If you got the extra bucks to pay for some high quality sushi, come here."}
{"text":"This is my neighbourhood go-to restaurant. Consistent, good quality food, large menu with lots of Japanese and some Korean options in a tranquil atmosphere and comfortable setting (although weekend evenings does get busier and noisier). Lunch prices are excellent, dinner prices are a bit higher, but it's still reasonable and definitely worth it. Sometimes service can be a bit slow when they are busy, but the servers are always friendly and accommodating. They provide a special soup with every meal which has little bits of tempora batter and noodle. It's very tasty and I've never seen it anywhere else. They also provide a miso soup with certain meals which is very flavourful. Both soups are always served hot. Basically everything is good and I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I've only been twice,  but I know that it will become a regular resturant in my life for sure.  

The service and staff are super friendly,  warm and welcoming.  

The food is delicious! They have Bibimbap!! Which is my favourite Korean dish.  So having this place that serves it be close to home is so amazing,  that I am so happy that I don't have to travel far to get it. Plus,  they have this other soup along with the miso soup that is sooo damn good! It has noodles in it and fried bits of heaven. 

Plus the sushi is on point.  They have a variety of different kinds that will keep any sushi lover happy! 

The place is amazing and so is the price. 

This is a go to resturant in Brampton for sure."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. Service was good. Sushi was yummy! I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best sushi restaurants in Brampton.

The rolls here are delicious! I'd rather come here for dinner than go to an all you can eat. The presentation is beautiful and the quality of sushi is great.. Definitely fresh every time I've ate here.

Service is also very good. Great atmosphere and clean!

There is really no reason to complain unless you're wanting to be super picky. 

Another reason to come here is the crunch soup they serve. AMAZING."}
{"text":"The decor was pretty, they light candles for the dinner service. I wasn't fond of the music choice; it was classical musical which doesn't suit a Japanese themed restaurant. I believe Japanese music would have been more suited. 

We were quickly seated by the server, she was very friendly and helpful. She constant came to check up on us. 

The bento box was a good price for what i payed. The sushi was good, the tempura was well made. I think the tempura was my favourite part of the meal.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants affordable sushi in Brampton."}
{"text":"Adequate downtown sushi place with plenty of seating. Usually I go to the smaller place just east of this one, but felt like a change. I wasn't disappointed but didn't fall in love with it either.

They do a brisk takeout business for the downtown lunch crowd, a great idea that I would take advantage of if I worked nearby. But I stopped in and did table service.  They gave AYCE but I chose a bento box off the regular menu.

The food was fine, overall, but the miso soup lacked flavour and the salad was drenched in a tasteless sauce and really amounted to just cut lettuce and not much else.

The main event, a chicken teriyaki bento, was overall good though the sweet potato tempura was barely cooked through and tough to eat."}
{"text":"Overall a very nice place for sushi.  The fish was fresh and tasted good.  The sushi rolls were well put together and presented well on the plate.  You'll find all your standard favorites here.  Very good execution on the food, good service, clean and easy parking on a Monday evening.  

Does it rise to the level 5 stars?  No.  Missing is the creativity beyond putting something different in the roll or on top of it.  All the specialty rolls seem more or less the same and I found choosing between them to be difficult because of that. 

Don't let the fact that this it isn't 5 stars food you - this is a great place for sushi."}
{"text":"Simply heavenly.  Honestly, my family and I loved every single thing that was placed in front of us!  The quality is beautiful, the flavours are perfect, the atmosphere is authentic, and the staff is wonderful!  We finally found our new sushi place!  There's something on their menu for all kinds of sushi lovers... it was all so delicious I didn't get to take a picture of anything we ate!"}
{"text":"Took my little brother to try sushi for the first time and he hated it. Being a seasoned sushi lover, their sushi had no taste to it. Honestly they need to rethink their menu."}
{"text":"great place to have sushi and Chinese food ?the place is clean and the service was awsome ?the young guy was very nice ?will come back soon?"}
{"text":"I had to hit the FedEx at Dundas and University on this freezing day, and once I was done dealing with printing, copying and mailing I was a hangry hot* mess. I walked out, and this was literally (not the new fangled way of saying it, actually literally) the first place I saw to eat. 

The servers were a little snippy, but it was the end of the lunch rush, which I am sure with their prices is quite a scene. $7.99 gets you a lunch special, made up of 12 rolls, two pieces of sushi, a miso soup and a salad drenched in creamy-ginger dressing. Not a bad price point, plus I got to sit in a squishy booth. Not the best sushi in Toronto by a long shot, but I'd certainly eat here again in another pinch. 

*Not literally hot, figuratively hot. My contacts actually froze to my eyes today. Cool. Literally cool."}
{"text":"Extremely cheap, and shockingly fast - but the food quality is as mediocre as one would expect. There's a lunch special here for $4.99, which gets you two rolls of your choice and a drink - it's pretty much the highest sushi/dollar ratio you'll find within a few kilometres' radius. 

That said, my friend and I tried the AYCE here - and were left wishing that we had ordered à la carte instead. The first order comes quickly, but the subsequent ones take ages - clearly, the restaurant is well aware of one-hour lunch limits, and wants to mitigate its costs.

Rolls are sparse on the fish, somewhat small, and only loosely packed (anyone with chopstick skills short of masterful will struggle). The chicken fried rice was absolutely terrible - it was almost devoid of chicken, and the rice itself tasted day-old. Service is sporadic and brusque.

Summary: come here for the quick and dirty lunch specials, not for a sit-down."}
{"text":"I really hate to spoil the party with all those five stars ratings around...

But:

There was a smell of rotten from the sashimi base. Not only mine, but my wife's, too.

Dangerous.

We were ok, no vomit, no parasites (at least so far), but that was a bit scary - as the last thing you want when eating raw fish is to get something not fresh.

Except for that, we liked the menu, it was nice and elaborate. The place itself was clean and inviting, prices low, portions ok - a bit on the smallish side.

The servers... Another case of super friendly folks completely wonderful to have around - yet forgetting to do their job. I hate waiving my hand in a futile attempt to attract the attention of the waiters chatting near the bar. And I don't like when I have to leave the tip while paying at the counter. Not fun, not smart.

My suggestion would be: Check it out at your own risk. Maybe the chef was in the bad mood that day, who knows? But for us, Sushi House is a definitive no go."}
{"text":"Came here with my partner for dinner, I'd never been before. We ordered the clear soup, lobster tempura, and a sashimi + sushi boat. The wait staff was friendly and very attentive up until we finished our meals and wanted to order desert. We had come around 9:00pm, and I believe the restaurant was close to closing so our service slowed down towards the end of the meal, but that is my only critique. This is our new favourite sushi spot in Brampton and we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Meh not a fan. The price for AYCE might be slightly cheaper than other places but the quality is definitely sacrificed. 

The sashimi was obviously not fresh but frozen - some of the pieces of octopus we got tasted very frozen and some of the salmon sashimi we got had evident markings engraved on them from the plastic packaging they came in. Nope. Also, some of the kitchen items weren't that great - the enoki mushroom and beef rolls were burnt and tasted crispy in the worst way possible. And, the sushi had too much rice and not enough of the other ingredients. 

My friends and I also really didn't care for the servers hovering over us every minute or so and basically watching us eat. Not a very good experience here for sure."}
