{"text":"Fantastic food, great service.  Urban Craft has not tried to overwhelm with endless pages of choices.  Instead they have presented a well thought out menu with great choices.  The Ratatouille is drop dead amazing - and I even cheated and added braised short ribs, are star on their own, but second to the fantastic flavor and makeup of this great twist on a veg dish.  Do yourself a favor and give it a try soon!"}
{"text":"Incredible! 5 star, 4 course meal inhaled as each course was promptly delivered. We will be back as often as we can. House made chips Shrimp salad Flat iron Urban burger And OMG! THE MOLTEN LAVA CAKE! I will work my way through the entire menu and try something new every time."}
{"text":"Unsuspecting hotel bar with incredible food. We came here because of the yelp reviews but were a little sceptical when we found out it was inside of an Embassy Suites. The atmosphere is not amazing but the food is fantastic! The wait staff is incredibly nice and attentive . . . we will definitely go back! Tip: the bruschetta is delicious!"}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place because we live near by and saw the good reviews. Food was good but not as amazing as I had expected considering the reviews of others. The thing that really put me off about this place is that the dining area has a lot left to be desired in ambiance. Just some standard wobbly 4 top tables spread throughout the heavily lighted open room with little to no decor. For the price, I expect there be more attention paid to the experience as well as the food. Kinda felt like I was in an empty Denny's or something. Since we were practically the only people there. Made me want to leave in a hurry."}
{"text":"This is just for the bar itself. Located inside the Embassy Suites. Decent bar and plenty of tables inside and out. They do server food but it was all about the liquor for me. Prices were very affordable and the pours were very heavy. The bartender is good and he evens remembers you. Good place for some beverages."}
{"text":"Checked out this hotel bar because we were staying in the hotel, we had just checked in and they had a free happy hour for registered guests. Nice facility off the lobby. Drinks plentiful and not skimpy. Nice snacks (munchies). They had areas where you could watch the big screens and areas away from the big screens if you wanted quiet. Bar staff was friendly. A nice experience."}
{"text":"Delicious drinks and tasty food. Affordable. Very friendly staff. Room service rates aren't bad! Very relaxing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Do not eat at this place!! I have been to a lot of restaurants, and this one is the worse I have ever been to. Both service and the food wise.  First of all, the service was terrible. No greeting nor water served until 20 mins after we were seated. We had to ask the water 3 times before it was actually brought to our table. Not to mention that this place wasn't even that busy. Two servers were just standing by the counter chatting. Another 30 mins passed, the food finally came. I ordered salmon, and it was totally burned. The portion was small, but it tasted so bad that I could only finish half of it. My boyfriend ordered a burger which also tasted plain. (We both thought McDonald's would server better burgers). The only thing that was edible was the french fries came with the burger.  I'm not sure where are all the good reviews coming from. It could just be a bad night, but we definitely wouldn't come back to this place."}
{"text":"AMAZING food, Craft Beer and Cocktails & Great Service! Stuffed Pork Chop, Urban Burger & Mac & Cheese are to die for"}
{"text":"Average hotel restaurant. OK if staying at the Embassy Suites, but not a destination restaurant. Burger was not cooked to order, and was typical hotel fare. They try to be trendy (with microbrews and other things) but really just average. Ok if staying there and you don't want to venture out (there is nothing nearby except a Dennys)."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food for a hotel that needs a refresh. I only had the chili and a beer -- both of which I found to be very good -- but I heard from others in the group I was with that the food, in general, was surprisingly good for the hotel experience."}
{"text":"I have to wonder if all of the current reviews were from employees because this was not at all what I was expecting. I met a friend here thinking It would be a cool new bar with a great happy hour. This is a straight up hotel bar with no atmosphere. Not only that, but their bar lights were flickering the whole time, which was really off putting. The staff at the bar had no idea what was on their happy hour menu... the one online? Not the real menu. I had wanted the delicious sounding specialty drink they had advertised on their website, but that drink didn't exist, or at least the employees working had no idea what I was talking about when I asked about said drink. Not only that, but I'm fairly certain the 'bartenders' were just regular hotel employees with no training in bartending. I ordered a sangria ( which on their menu detailed all of the 'pressed juices' and different ingredients)... it literally was poured from a premade mix bottle straight. It tasted fairly horrific, overly sweet and almost undrinkable. My friend got a margarita, which tasted like straight cheap tequila, no freshness to be found. Both were extremely unpleasant. Originally, I had wanted to try some food, but there was no way. So maybe the food is good, but I wouldn't return to find out."}
