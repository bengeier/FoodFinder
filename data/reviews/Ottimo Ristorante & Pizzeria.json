{"text":"Went for a Sunday evening dinner with some new friends - 4 of us all together. I have eaten a lot of Italian food in my time and this was honestly the worst I have ever had. I've had freezer meals that were more Italian in style and tasted better than that. Even value Italian freezer meals that were better. We were guests of our friends, but if I'd been paying I'd have sent everything back, but I don't like to make a fuss if I am not paying the bill (nor chose the restaurant).

The services was adequate - relatively timely, I guess - but the waiter rushed around and disappeared twice while we were trying to order drinks which was a bit disconcerting. I think he was putting the beer we had ordered in the fridge, to be honest. Wonder why none was already in there. 

I had to ask for a glass of water (took some getting because the waiter was running around) and received a tiny tumbler - no glasses of water for everyone as you'd usually expect. Also, the bread we were served was at least a day or more old - hard for the outer half inch inside the crust and tough as old boots. That shows a lot of cost cutting when you don't even throw out the sliced bread at the end of each day's service and is a good sign for why the rest of the food was so horrible. The parmesan was also pretty dry and old. If you can't even get the basics right, it doesn't bode well. Sure enough, the main courses were dire.

Dishes we had:
Veal pasta: Pasta was undercooked, sauce was bland, vegetables overcooked and the veal was so tough it must have been the fastest runner to avoid the slaughterhouse for such a long life. It was awful.

Chicken Parmigiana: The chicken was also incredibly tough and rubbery and was burnt on the bottom. The pasta was also undercooked. It was also pretty bland and I suspect it was reheated at least once. Horrible.

My friends had a chicken dish (the chicken was ok, but the salad was wilted and looked old. Apparently the vegetables were also pretty dire) and a steak (the steak was tough, undercooked and the vegetables with it were also overcooked and pretty bad). 

Not one of us finished our meals and in typical over-polite style, we just politely paid our bill and left. I'd never go back here again and would actively warn people against it. Our friends said they had one previous meal here and thought it was pretty good, so our immediate thought was that there is more than one chef and we chose a night where the trainee was on? But the poor food storage/shelf life decisions showed and general incompetence of the cooking makes me wonder if it is more than that."}
{"text":"July 2, 2014 I ordered 5 pizzas for a family birthday. I was originally told they would be ready in an hour. 45 minutes later I got a call from Just-Eat advising me the restaurant needed an additional 20 minutes, a half hour after that I arrived at the restaurant only to find out that 1 of my 5 pizzas was in the oven and the others hadn't been started (there were 6 patrons IN TOTAL in the restaurant, not tables, 6 people). When I asked for a refund from the waiter I was told he wouldn't do it nor would he speak with Just-Eat to authorize a refund. Just-Eat called the restaurant twice and I watched the staff stand in front of the phone, see \"Just-Eat\" appear on the call display and refuse to answer. I found the staff to be arrogant, rude and completely uninterested in my business. I was told if I wanted their food I should have ordered directly from them - their prices were higher than on JE as at the time there was a 20% off deal. There are plenty of places that offer fine pizzas in the area, I would highly suggest people source out a different option. I left my information for the owner/manager and have yet to hear back."}
{"text":"Ottimo must mean horrible. The food here tastes canned. My veal was mushy, so were my veggies. The only enjoyable part was my potatoes and i didnt go for italian to eat potatoes. The pasta sauce for sure was made by campbells soup. 

Anyway, so the food is expensive and unenjoyable, you get it. As for the service also brutal. We ordered bread, never came. They brought bread to the other tables who arrived after us. When we asked for bread the waiter told us \"the other guy was going to get it.\" Ill never be back. 

Look up romi or sempre - much better options in the area."}
{"text":"My family came for dinner last week and we ate on premise. Nice and clean tiny restaurant. Food was perfect and waiter was very polite. I will return soon.

We had a really nice time.

Next time though, please could you provide soft butter for the bread instead of cold butter. It's hard to spread on the bread. Thanks! :)"}
{"text":"Small place but great food! The portions are huge. I'd suggest any of the pastas. Wine is reasonable in price too. Gem"}
{"text":"Key Features: A number of filling pizzas ranging from 10 - 15 dollars.

I headed out west to Royal York, searching for a place to eat dinner.  I wanted to expand my culinary horizons.  The Fiance did not want to stay in, and who am I to argue with that?  

Looking around online, we found Ottimo Ristorante.  I was a little worried after seeing some of the other reviews, but I thought I'd have to give it a go, and find out for myself.

Thursday evening, the place wasn't empty - but it wasn't full, either.  There were about seven other diners.  The waiter quickly came over, answered all the questions we had, and got us under way.  It took seventeen minutes from the time of ordering, to the pizza being on our table.  

I was worried that the service might be slow, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I wouldn't have wanted it any sooner, as we had time for some good conversing, before the food showed up.

Now - on to the food.  It wasn't the best pizza I've ever had, and it wasn't awful.  The crust is somewhat bland, and the sauce is very muted.  But, the fresh vegetables, and the goat's cheese was fantastic.  There was no doubt that by the end of my meal, I was stuffed.  I couldn't imagine anyone ever agreeing to order dessert after finishing their meal.  No doubt they would explode is a fresh-vegetable medley of delight.

I did want their crepe, mind you.  It just wasn't going to happen.

There is a large, extensive, menu here.  There's pasta, and all sorts of other Italian standards as well.  The website lists their full menu, with up to date prices, so there will be no surprise.

The only downside is that it is a bit more expensive than I would like to pay.  If the prices were dropped $2.00 (and, I know I'm really reaching for hairs here) I would find it an all around more agreeable establishment.  But, there's no reason not to give it a shot.  Everyone needs an excuse to get out of their city-comfort-zone."}
{"text":"Went with my friend, who told me she really likes this place and gets their takeout every Friday. Seemed like a safe bet...and it was! 

I'm a little confused by the earlier reviews...well...I'm confused by ONE earlier review. But then again, not really, because some people are...well...the way they are! Whatcha gonna do??

As with traditional Italian restaurants (both in the city AND in Italy), the waiters do not coddle you. 

Anyway, the service was great. We had a very attentive waiter. He asked us where we would prefer to sit and we chose a seat for two, but the window. 

The menu is extensive, with a lot of choice. I was debating between a couple of dishes, so my friend suggested we order two things and share. She ordered a pasta dish and I ordered a pizza. 

While we waited for the main course, we were given a basket and soft bread and oil and vinegar...mmmmmmmm....

Our food came out and both dishes were DELICIOUS! The pasta was great, the sauce was especially good. The pizza had mozzarella and goat cheese and veggies...goat cheese on pizza = perfecto! 

We had leftovers....and then we decided to hell with self control and ate them. 

Needless to say, we were too stuffed for dessert. Shame, because they looked very good.

Turns out that this is not the first time I have had food from here. The same friend, used these guys to cater a party she had. She had some large trays of pasta and I remember really enjoying them...you know, as far as catered food goes (to please everyone, they had gotten pastas on the plainer side). 

I think this is a good, solid place. Prices are what you would expect for the food and area.

Why missing one star? I've still had better Italian in the city....I'm picky enough that I need to be REALLY blown away to award 5 stars. 

That doesn't mean this isn't a good place, worth checking out though!"}
{"text":"Called ahead to make a reservation because it was Saturday night, but got there and found out we didn't need it, it wasn't very busy. Not sure why, the food was really good. The service and food was a bit slow but otherwise it was good. They seemed to have lots of take out and online order pick ups."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant as part of a meet up group of 17 wine enthusiast for a tasting. The company was great! The service was non exist ant for a small restaurant.  I found we had to signal our waiter John for every little including bread! He came around once to take our food order. I ordered a risotto as I thought a small Italian restaurant would perfecta something I have been unable to do at home. It was dry and the chicken tough...not once did our waiter come over to our table of 10 and ask how the meal was. When I asked for cheese he said there was a bowl on the table and we had to share with the other ten people finally had to once again signal him to come over and sent my dish back. I explained it was dry...he asked if I wanted more sauce the heck do you add more sauce to a rissoto...then had the nerve to ask if I wanted to take it home!
When the bill came I couldn't believe they charged me for the meal. Then when I left gave him $20 enough to cover my drink (one ) he explained I had not given him enough money. He said he was also the manager. I WOULD NEVER GO BACK THERE...as in every good restaurant we know the food can't always be great...but the service should be!"}
