{"text":"My first impression was that it was a very clean and family-friendly place.  My second thought was that the breakfast was pricey.  My final impression was that it was worth every penny.  Had the lumberjack and everything was perfect.  The meats were very high quality and not a salty mess.  The hash browns were real and actually had some seasoning other than salt and pepper!  The service was incredibly fats and friendly.  The only complaint I have is the water glasses are tiny.  This is my new favorite breakfast place in Whitby."}
{"text":"I went here this morning for breakfast.  They had a wide variety of omelettes on the menu. I ended up getting scrambled eggs, bacon, and home fries. The eggs and home fries were delicious, but I'm not a bacon person. I think it was like almost $6 for my meal. Oh and it also came with toast and a drink.  its a really cozy place if you are in the area."}
