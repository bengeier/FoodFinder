{"text":"My Friend and I had dinner at Falker's Tavern for the first time this evening.  We both agree it was amazing.  We started with the appetizer platter. It was very good...mozzarella sticks, fried zucchini, fried pickle spears, fried ravioli, hot cheese balls----need I say more?!The wings were breaded and perfectly seasoned with choice of great sauces.  We also had the build your own burger.  It was amazingly tasty, good quality beef and the cook, Kevin came and checked in on us.  He clearly cared about our enjoyment.  Our waitress, Stacy, was filled with hospitality, very attentive and enhanced the great experience.   I would highly recommend.   Thanks, Falker's Pub"}
