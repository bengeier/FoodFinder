{"text":"I would not go back here. I ordered the all you can eat tacos. I asked for extra tomatoes, and when I received the tacos there were barely any tomatoes (although I did ask for extra!) and I was told I would be charged a dollar for asking for extra. I was not informed about this extra charge when I asked for them.   The meat in the tacos was room temperature. The plate was hot, but the tacos were not.   I've been to many Mexican restaurants in the valley, and I would honestly have to say the $1 tacos on tuesdays at Filibertos are better. I will not return here."}
{"text":"F-ing delicious. As I'm typing my husband described them as \"quite impressive\". Grew up in Los Angeles so I've had Mexican food up, down, and sideways and like to think I'm a decent judge of it. When we moved to AZ this happened to be one of the first places we tried as it was recommend to us by family from AZ. At first glance it may look sketchy. It's at the tail end of a small shopping center with a pawn shop and looks tiny. Deceiving tho because the inside is pretty big and it's clean.   Food tho is AMAZING!!!! Comes out piping hot and plates loaded. My faves are the mini chimichangas (I've had all of the meat fillings) which my kids also LOVE! Burritos are to die for and while all of their meats are good, the asada is especially delicious. I can't stand asada with lots of fat and gristle and they trim theirs to perfection. Have always had great wait staff and if you can make Happy Hour do it. Margaritas for $3 and you're feeling good after one or two!!! There is another Popos location on Bell Rd, which I hear is nicer. Maybe it's the newer location, but I've only ever had great experiences at the Indian School location so I continue to go there and I actually frequent Bell more often. Maybe I'll get around to going someday in the meantime, you go here!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! The staff works very slow and the hostess had an awful attitude; the manager's attitude was no better. Can't give a review on the food because I was so disgusted by the way we were treated that we left before we could order. Will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Good food, even better prices. Every day has a great special to offer. My kids get the burrito and I love the Margarita, frozen are the best."}
{"text":"Popo's is one of the best Mexican restraunts I've been to! Me and my mom frequent Popos about once a week if we can, and I am never disappointed with my food. The portions are large and filling, the chips are 9/10 (sometimes they are not hot, but I don't poke at that much), and my mom and sister have said their salsa is amazing. We have a cop friend there that is super kind to guests by fare-welling them as he sees them as they leave. We've only had one slightly negative experience from a waiter, where one of the side ladies (not a waitress persay, just like the helper that brings chips) took our drink order and pretty much everything else in between. The waiter only saw us about 2 times during the entire dinner, to take our orders and bring them to us. I soon realized he was overworked as he was rushing all around the restraunt so I don't blame him for it. I love Popos, and highly recommend it! :)"}
{"text":"Things have gone back to great at Popo's.  Guess that once they got settled in up north the managers came back and whipped our favorite westside location into shape.  You have to try the chicken tacos.  No other location in the valley comes close to this form of perfection."}
{"text":"After having others recommend this place to me as the best Mexican in Phoenix, even going so far to say \"I drive such and such amount of miles just to get there!\" I was sorely disappointed when I tried the restaurant's fare.  I had a shredded beef burrito with a side of beans and my wife had some sort of chicken quesadilla, but you wouldn't know any of the dishes from a saucer full of salt. Yeah, the saltiness was that bad. On top of that, my wife's food was so greasy she didn't eat more than a few bites till she lost her appetite and returned it.  The service was good; the waitress was nice and didn't give us any flak about the return, taking it off the bill. Other than her, though, this place loses; \"best place for Mexican,\" indeed.   I've basically given up on finding decent Mexican in Phoenix; can cook better, myself."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in AZ!!!! We drive from Gilbert for this stuff! We usually get the chicken chimichanga and tacos. Always great food!"}
{"text":"Gotta love that salsa....I like the Beer, My wife likes the Monster Taco, Brother likes the Red Chilli Quesada...check it out!"}
{"text":"My favarite Mexican food in the Valley.  The chicken chimi is awesome!  The portions are a bit too big, but it's a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Love this place. Recommend there monster burrito, this thing is just what it says I share with wife. Also great Margaritas at a great price."}
{"text":"The worst service and management I have ever experienced.  Not only did another table come in after us, get served and get their meal before we could order but the manager argued with us because we asked for a styrofoam container to take our salsa home.  I asked to purchase one for .50 cents (which could probably by 10 or more for that amount).  The manager still said no!  You never argue with a customer.  She said if I wanted to buy salsa I could have that container. We've been going here for years, but they just lost two more customers and hopefully anyone who reads this.  I'd rather give my money to someone who actually appreciates our business."}
{"text":"Nommy nommy nommy nom...best food in town in my tummy tum tum.  I have been going to Popo's for over 15 years and I love it. Consistently good service, consistently good food, consistently clean. You can't beat the prices or the portions which are MASSIVE! The spicy is slightly Americanized, low heat, for the snow birds but just ask and they will spice it up for you. The salsa is always fresh, I mean you put it in your mouth and you think...mmmm.....fresh! The chips are delicious. I have to admit I am a creature of habit I get the same thing every time because I love it, chicken chimichanga with jalapeno cream cheese and sour cream. It's da bomb!   I ate the spinach enchiladas when I went vegetarian, they are good but still not my favorite. My Mom likes the sample platter and for $11 she noms on it for at least three days it's so much food. The margaritas are strong and yummy and cheap, for $4.75 you get a very large glass and one will give you a nice warm fuzzy feeling...even cheaper during happy hour. The fried ice cream is the best, served in a fried tortilla bowl, covered in chocolate sauce, whipped cream and cherries....oooooh, I am getting hungry to go back already!  Don't ask about the one on Bell and 59th Ave. I haven't been there but Mom has and she didn't like it as much so we always just go back to our favorite in that tiny little strip mall with crap for parking...don't care....food is worth it. I'd give this place six stars if it let me, yes, I like it that much, a pleasurable experience every time and I can think of no other restaurant I can say that about.  My only regret is that I have told so many people about it over the years I'm sure that's why I now have to wait 10 minutes to get seated....LOL!"}
{"text":"Location:  not the best of neighborhoods, small strip center dominated by a pawn shop and the restaurant. Service:  A little slow but not excessive, friendly staff Food:  Cheese and Onion enchiladas, ground beef taco and rice and refried beans. Enchiladas were very tasty and hot although a little shy on onions; rice cooked well but a little bland; beans average.  The salsa and chips were very good, not overly spicy and chips crispy.  I will return."}
{"text":"very good food to eat on but take out duck haven had their right order 4 out 7 so i stopped use to enjoy it why get mad when i'm home with their wroooong order can't  complain  what good food but still don't like wrong one when you spend 80 to hundred  hard working dollars just shut up n do what you got a do but not gone cry about it they gina do it again. ( not to me ) enjoy  they do have good food thou"}
{"text":"F+++ this place ask me and my wife to leave cause we smelled like marijuana dumb idiots have no clue we waited for 15 minutes before some clown looking waitress told us they can't  serve us drinks as we are there eating chips told her to call the cops she said they did and couldn't do nothing about it morans will never get my Business ever again and will be looking to file a complaint and if the real manager have some balls and reply because people saying they are the manager when they are not is a joke"}
{"text":"Delicious food as always wonderful staff. Place was really busy on Monday but service  was like we were the only ones there!! Definitely worth our drive from Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing.    Lots of heavy fried stuff.  Nothing fresh."}
{"text":"We just ate a late lunch there.  I am a avid taco and bean and cheese burrito fan and I was not dissapointed.  I am picky about my beans and they were excellent here.  Also had a machaca taco, was really good!  There salsa was fresh and homemade, hot sauce was good too.  Guacamole great.  My husband had a carne asada taco, a fish taco and rice and beans and he loved them.  Plates were very large and we brought some home.  Sister in Laws had carnitas with rice and beans and flour tortillas and said it was excellent.  Father in law had beef enchilada and rice and beans and almost licked his plate!  Really good for him as he is almost 91!  All in all was very very good. Try it, don't think you will be dissapointed."}
{"text":"food is great only 1 problem. ...it smells real bad the carpet is filthy please change"}
{"text":"Terrible hostess!! Evertime I come with my family to eat here they seat all other parties before us!! Even when they have tables available!! They food however is great but not very friendly family if you have a big family!! Very disappointing! :("}
{"text":"First off..... The service is OUTSTANDING! My husband and I got seated immediately. Within 1 minute, we had water with lemon and warm chips & salsas the our table. Less than 2 minutes later we ordered two margaritas. They were delivered within another 2 minutes! We were given time to peruse menu. My husband ordered the Carne Asada. I ordered the Chilie Rellanos. Both meals were excellent. I am quite a Rellanos aficionados. Theirs were out of this world!! The special sauce topping the fluffy Rellanos was perfectly delicious! This dish is served with loose pinto beans that tasted almost \"buttery\". We were so happy with our meals. Would definitely recommend this to anyone!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Popo's since I was in utero.  Popo's is in my blood (literally) .  You can find the original popo's (There's 2 now!) on 67th ave and Indian School in a little run down shopping strip.  Please don't let the area and the looks of the shopping strip fool you. Take a chance, go in, sit down and order.  I promise you wont be let down.  The food is plentiful and the flavors are fantastic.  But beware the chips and salsa!  Often times new comers fill up on the delicious chips and salsa and have little room for their entree!  The staff is great and attentive.  There are T.Vs posted throughout the restaurant that usually have some sort of sporting event on.  If you'd like to watch a specific even (Basketball game on espn?) Just ask and they do their best to accommodate your viewing needs.  Oh and on one last note, I've never got a dish at popo's that was'nt up to my standards.   Dishes of choice:   Green Chili Con Carne Shredded Chicken Chimichanga Enchilada Style w/ Jalapeno Cream Cheese Mini Platter - Oh the Mini Platter.. Although an appetizer I often get this as main course.  Two Mini Chimichangas, Two Mini Flatas, Two Mini Tacos, Two Mini Tostadas, a Tamale (Green Corn for me), Rice and Beans.   Fried Ice Cream - Try It!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I has the best salsa and chips. It is a little scary when you have to park out back, but it is safe."}
{"text":"My favorite mexican food place to eat at, I've been going here since I was five years old 25 years ago!!!!"}
{"text":"Been eating here on and off since 1982. My favorite Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Nasty food. They have the worst service ever. Asked for something never got it. Don't waste your money or time. It seemed like one person was helping everyone. Nasty nasty nasty"}
{"text":"Always Consistent. If a restaurant can't nail down consistency...what's the point? Knowing what you're getting when you go is a plus.   This place has been here for a long time. There used to be a Popo's Too on the east side until it sadly closed down. My sister and I were not happy campers. But low and behold the original is still alive and well and kickin' great dishes EXACTLY LIKE THEY DID ON THE EAST SIDE! Again, consistency. The owner is always present and taking checks, seating guests and that again is an added bonus. Everything is fresh, the rice is great, unlike most places here where it's just starchy and gross and the medium salsa is always yummy. Request the hot salsa as well...it's not overly hot and quite frankly not sure why it's their \"hot\" salsa but regardless-it's deliscious. I had the El Pollo Especial except I ordered it not fried and with Machaca beef...and they were of course accomodating. The jalepeno cream cheese they top it with is well, excessive, however a little goes along way and I'll be eating the other half for dinner.   If you get the opportunity to go, go. The margaritas are also quite yummy and who can go wrong with $.99 ritas for happy hour. Just wish they were closer to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I often bring the family here. Its our favorite restaurant to eat at. Go there on Tuesdays and Saturdays for $1 Margaritas. I always have the spinach enchiladas and they are fairly priced too. I can feed the family of 5 for $40."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. The salsa was fresh and delicious and I ordered a steak fajita chimighanga that was simply amazing."}
{"text":"This place is okay, but very close to where I work.  It's always crowded, and the food is decent.  They have a lot of drink specials, and you can find many people coming in for the $.99 margaritas, but I prefer the Santa Fe salad.  I get it to go once in a while, which is a bit pricey (9.50) because at least if you eat there, you can get chips and salsa.  Not bad for an area inundated with fast food.  Not many choices."}
{"text":"Been going to popos for years now and I must say,  hands down the best most authentic mexican food place around.  I bring all of my out of town family and friends here to eat."}
{"text":"The food is good, its been a while since I've come. They always seem to be busy. I should come back again sometime and see if they've added new menu items or if they have happy hour :)"}
{"text":"Popo's has been around forever and it certainly looks the part. The neighborhood ain't great and the strip mall it's located in looks awfully scary at certain times of night, but it's definitely worth the risk.  The best days to visit are definitely Tuesdays and Saturdays, when they serve $.99 margaritas. While not the greatest margaritas in the world, you can actually taste the tequila and for $.99, you don't have much to lose. Generally, I get a chicken chimichanga or red chili burrito, both of which are solid and filling choices. If I'm heading over on a Saturday, I'll get a bowl of their red menudo, which is by far the best red menudo I've ever had. The chili has a nice kick, but overall it's a more subtle flavor than is generally found in a bowl of red. Works great as a late-night accompaniment to a margarita.  The staff are all pretty friendly and in the decade I've been going here, there hasn't really been a whole lot of employee turnover. It can be kind of a chore to get a seat on certain days, due to the customer traffic, and the parking lot is a pain in the butt, but if you're a west-sider with an appetite for Mexican food, Popo's should be in your itinerary."}
{"text":"First time and what a disappointment.  The red menudo has no flavor, its greasy and the to-go portion is a joke. They use the containers for a side of beans or rice... and to make things worse I get home an its cold, no silverware or the normal fixings that any other Mexican restaurant offers like to lime, cilantro, oregano, onion, etc.   I had a few spoonfuls and decide to throw it away. I would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how they don't have 5 starts. But this is absolutely the BEST Mexican food you will find in phx,AZ! I have been going here for as long as I can remember! I also go to Rocky Point every year and to be honest, Popos beats some if the places down there! I love their chips and salsa (both of them) and 3 way burros!! Mmmmm definitely a must!!"}
{"text":"Use to be a fave spot. Haven't been back in a while but tried for lunch. Unfortunately there was a bad smell in the place that I couldn't sit through. Too bad"}
{"text":"I happen to LOVE LOVE LOVE  PoPo's...I was raised here in Arizona, so i've been to many many mexican food places to eat...most of those are gone now...but PoPo's thankfully, is still going strong !!  I love the atmosphere there...the food is BOMB..and any and all of the wait  staff is friendly and super fast !! I don't have the most tolerable pallate where spicy food is concerned..but  any of the dishes I have gotten there have been tops !!   Just keep up the great work PoPo's !! I'll always be back !!"}
{"text":"Great salsa, great food!  Been coming here for years for lunch.  Server Mauricio always gives great service."}
{"text":"Really good food .  Friendly waitress. Well worth the 20 minute wait.  Busy place but fast service"}
{"text":"We have been to Popo's a number of times and it is on the list when we have friends in from out of town. Saturday was our most recent visit. All of the previous posts about the area are somewhat accurate. It can be intimidating. Once you get past the location, the inside is inviting, the service very friendly, and the food delicious. The best news of all is we learned Popo's will soon be opening a new restaurant in Glendale at 59th and Bell Rd (near the old Costco) the first week of December. Can hardly wait to try the new place."}
{"text":"Just got in from eating at Popos. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. I ordered a carnitas chimichanga with beans and cheese. My burrito went from 9.99 to 13.63 in a blink of an eye. My burrito came greasy with no beans in it.  My boyfriends sister ordered the all you can eat tacos and tostadas. The plate came with one taco one tostada rice and beans, good size portions. She only ate the tostada and was full. Never asking for an extra taco or tostada. She asked for a to go box for the taco. The waitress server #167 Sally B. told her that since she ordered the all you can eat she can't take the taco home. So you prefer to throw it away than allowing someone who paid for it take it and eat it. Wow poor customer service. When the bill came I was charged for the beans I had already mentioned were not in there. She then removed 70 cents for them when i was charged almost $3.00 for them. Needles to say Sally did not get a tip.  Ooooh Sally that girl you just gave your restaurant a bad score. You need a class in customer service. I will never return again."}
{"text":"Probably have been here around 15 times over the last 2 years and only have been slightly disappointed in my food maybe twice. The margaritas are great and the food almost always is great, I usually go for the shrimp or beef burrito and am always happy with them. My biggest complaint with the place is that is in a sorta ghetto area but otherwise if you want authentic Mexican food come here!"}
{"text":"At one time this was our favorite Mexican Resturant and happily drove the 20 plus miles to go there.   Sadly, that is no longer the case and after multiple 2nd chances it's not likely we will be making the trip here anymore.  The service which was always impeccable has become mediocre at best, long waits to be acknowledged after being sat, long waits for food that has been less than acceptable, cold, or completely wrong on multiple occasions. The salsa is still amazing and when the food is right it's very good.  But it's become a crap shoot.  And if you enjoy multitudes of children running free screaming, hanging over your booth, this is your type of place because the servers and management have no problem letting this go on.  I'll pass from now on."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the Valley! I grew up eating here, nothing comes close. Get the #1 or Pop's complete. Their Mr. Pibb is the best I've had. The free chips and salsa is great too!"}
{"text":"Popo's  is the bomb!!! My all time  favorite is the red chile chimi ,but everything is good here"}
{"text":"My family and I absolutely love this place. Great service and excellent food. The only Mexican food we eat when we got out. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Popo's is one of the old fashioned kind of Mexican restaurant that I rarely go to anymore. Mostly cuz they are often so generic and blah.  Yet there is something  warm and homey and satisfying about this spot, like  some body's grandmother looked around the grocery store and decided to add things like add cream cheese to her traditional cooking. And it works for me.  The other day, after a long hot hike in the desert,  we ended up here to completely stuporize ourselves. I was pleased to see the happy servers and multigenerational groups getting some shade and 99 cent margaritas on a Sunday afternoon. I looked around at what the other diners were having and decided on the chimichanga, enchilada style. I really liked the enchilada sauce and the red chili filling which was actually spicy with melt in your mouth cubes of beef. Seriously like my mom used to make. I skipped the rice and beans because this deep fried baby was more than filling on its own. Especially as we had started with a small bowl of the chile con Queso dip that was soothing and smooth with just a little kick. The chips accompanying the dip were warm and crisp.  This is the place when you want Mexican comfort food that actually also has some flavor. As other reviewers have noted, it's heavy and hearty fare.  But sometimes that's what you need."}
{"text":"For those of you with a cast iron stomach, you'll do well. For the rest of us mortals, well, I suggest staying near the bathroom the next day.   Sounds horrible, but it really isn't. The food is really, really good. The portions are ridiculous, and they are not afraid to toss half a pound of cheese on your plate. Of course, you'll pay for it the next day, but its worth it.   The spinach enchiladas are great, although I have no idea what that Baja sauce is, since its buried under a mountain of cheese."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy this place, but then we starting having customer service problems and inconsistent food.  Most recently, I was considering going there for dinner tonight with a gift card I had purchased last year.  I used a small portion of the gift card last year, but don't remember how much is on it.  When deciding for dinner tonight, price is a factor so I called to find out how much is on the gift card.  They won't tell me.  They said the only way to find out is to come in and swipe the card!!!  I live quite a ways away, so that is not going to happen just to decide if we are going there for dinner.  Then, I read on the internet the cards expire after a year.  It doesn't say that on the \"refillable\" card and nobody ever said anything when I bought the card.  I am forced to assume, since they don't want me to know how much is on it, they will come up with an excuse to say it is expired anyhow.  Hmmmm....drive more than 20 miles just to take my chances?  I think not.  I guess the card will go in the trash and Popo's will go on my \"Used to go there\" list.   The food is still pretty good, but the service will prevent me from going back."}
{"text":"Love Popo's! Used to come here all the time when I lived in Phoenix way back in the 80's.  Love just about everything---great machaca.  Now whenever I visit relatives in Phoenix, I always make them take me here as soon as I hit town!  Glad to see it's lasted all these years.."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Recommend the taco grande with brisket and jalapeño cream cheese. Also the tamales were excellent; melt in your mouth. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I love Popo's!  Staff is friendly and attentive.  Food is delish.  Lots of food.   I send everyone there who hasn't tried it.  Westsiders know it's the place to go.  They handle parties there and have a margarita special that rocks.  It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"This place is completely out of my way and completely worth the trip. The spicy bean dip and fried tortillas are like HOLY SH*% and the Carnitas Chimichanga was so good if they had just brought me a plate of Carnitas and nothing else it would have been worth the trip. Great portions, great prices, location is a little eh' but the food is bangin! Great Sangria Margarita too."}
{"text":"Saturday, I invite a business partner for lunch to popo's we sat in the bar area, our server was under age, had no clue on drinks, the person behind the bar finally comes over, we get ready to leave and ask for container for the salsa THE UNDER AGE SERVER COULD NOT PROVIDE A SMALL CONTAINER FOR THE SALSA, MANAGER COMES OVER AND SAID ITS AGAINST POLICY TO GIVE A CONTAINER FOR SALSA....did not make sense whatsoever! Where is your customer service? Because of the way it was handled, not a place I will refer business or take business client's in future."}
{"text":"I remember first going to Popo's with my parents 20+ years ago.  I recently rediscovered it and it is now our favorite place for Mexican food. The food isn't that pricey and the quality of it is Very good.  After all these years it still looks like a hole-in-the-wall from the outside, but the inside will surprise you!  Give it a try... you will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I'm an adventurous restaurant goer and savor the thrill of a new find, so when my Mom's friend (whose credibility was heightened by herself being Mexican) said you've got to try Popo's we drove the 20 miles with open minds and hungry stomachs.  We knew it wasn't going to look like the Taj Mahal from the outside so no disappointment there when it appeared inconspiculously on the west end of a tiny strip mall.  However, when we went inside it was truly a pleasant surprise.  We were instantly intercepted by two friendly hostesses who gave us friendly smiles and pleasant hellos.  Then we looked around and saw the place was really well designed.  Beautiful interior, flat-screen TV's all over the place (bonus), beautiful tile floors and just a generally well-kept appearance.  I bolted for the men's room before being seated (after all, it was a long drive) and for those of you who have eaten at a lot of Mexican restaurants know the restroom is not always highly anticipated.  It was immaculate, had a granite countertop and hands-free everything.  Another bonus.  We sat down to the usual greeting of chips and salsa and our table of three unanimously agreed the chips were delicious and thin and crispy and the salsa was fresh-tasting, flavorful and with just enough heat to let you know you're alive.  I ordered the seafood enchiladas and was decidedly disappointed.  It wasn't bad, it just lacked a certain richness that makes a dish like that really sing.  My Mom got a chile relleno and taco---my parents are both relleno fans---and again something was missing.  It seemed like the batter was not prominent enough and thus lacked full flavor.  The taco, however, was killer.  The machaca beef was delicious and the shell was appropriatley greasy, lending to a nice hardy bite.  My Dad ordered a beef tamale which came nicely stuffed (lots of places you can't find the filling) but it was dry and lacked any real flavor.  He also had a cheese enchilada which was decent.  I must comment that my Mom makes THE BEST Spanish rice you'll ever eat and so we're constantly surprised at how much of an afterthought rice is at Mexican restaurants.  Not so at Popo's.  While it's not as good as dear old Mom's, it was the best I've had out at a restaurant.  Why?  It had flavor!  I tasted garlic and crushed tomato that to me makes it so good.  The beans were also excellent and flavorful.  Service was friendly and attentive.  I don't think I'll drive out of my way to go back but I would certainly eat there again and try different dishes."}
{"text":"Stopped by after a Brewers game. Doesn't look like much from the outside but it was so good! We had carne tacos, fish tacos and chicken chimi. Way too much food! Chips and salsa were great. House Margaritas hit the spot. Definitely worth the stop. We'd come back if the opportunity presented itself."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican Food in Phoenix! I love everything about this place!"}
{"text":"My sister Judy invited me to dinner for my birthday, so I chose Popo's because my nine year old grand niece, Bella, says it is her fave, especially the salsa. What a pleasant surprise. The salsa is a close second to my fave Jalapeños in Scottsdale. The portions are generous and their food was excellent. And the place was packed with a line out the door. And, the servers came and sang Happy Birthday!  Check it out, this place rocks it."}
{"text":"Although the service was top-notch the food was not the salsa dip had hair and there meat was cold and blan"}

This little hole in the wall eatery never lets me down.  The drinks are good and the food is delicious and authentic. We also use them for catering at work and get nothing but compliments on \"Popo's days\""}

{"text":"One third the day after Christmas, there was a one hour wait for food. The chili Riano was very salty, but the chips and salsa and a margarita were great. Food was very salty.  Also had indigestion.  Wife said that the tacos were great, and her stomach was not upset."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a long time my favorite is the carne asada plate I love their chips and salsa  They are busy all the time but their service is fast and good !"}
{"text":"Old favorite. Food was great. Exterior of location is dirty, if I were a newbie I'd pass pass on the look and feel. Interior could be better, cleaner. Wait staff was excellent."}
{"text":"Got their chicken special burrito. It's a lot of food. I got lucky and came on $.99 margarita night. Only if your meal is more than $7 and only on Tuesday nights. Just ate the burrito, and half the beans. The rice wasn't too keen. Pretty much sums it up. Salsa was super fresh but not amazing tasting. Think I'd only come back on margarita night."}
{"text":"I went for the first time on a Saturday at lunch time with my girlfriend. The place was quite busy, but we were greeted and seated within minutes. Within another few minutes, staff took our drink orders and brought out chips and salsa. I enjoyed the salsa quite a bit, however I thought the chips were just ok (I can't really complain about free chips!). The staff was definitely on point with their service. Everything came out at the right time and our drinks were always full.  I ordered a machaca chimichanga topped with guacamole and sour cream. It came with a side of rice and beans (my girlfriend ordered the same). Our food came out in a good appropriate amount of time. What I mean by that is we had enough time to enjoy our chips and salsa, but not enough time to finish the salsa and wonder where our food was.  My chimi was absolutely delicious! The saying \"melts in your mouth\" is how I would describe it. I would drive out to Phoenix (I live in the east valley) just to order this again. The rice was different than I expected, (a bit spicier?), but it was good. I wasn't a huge fan of the beans, but I wasn't overly concerned since I was completely stuffed and had to take the rest home.  The interior decor is pleasant and not overbearing. There are lots of TVs playing various games, but I didn't feel as though I was in a sports bar. The exterior looks a bit run down, but don't let this fool you! This is definitely a hole-in-the-wall sort of place and I was blown away by the quality of food and service. Based on my first experience, I would highly recommend you try Popo's Fiesta Del Sol."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious Mexican food.  Everything is served with lots of cheese...yummy! Love the sopapillas with honey too."}
{"text":"Never disappointed with the food or service. Been going here since I moved to Phoenix almost 5 years ago. The carnitas, tacos, spinach enchiladas, and chimichanga are all good choices. Chips and salsa are always fresh!"}
{"text":"Patticake took very good care of us. Food was great. Could not finish the combo I ordered. Number one combo.   Margarittas were inexpensive and fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is great! The rice and beans alone will have you coming back. The place is clean, service is fast, and everything that I have had from the chimichanga's, tacos and burritos were better than expected. We will definitely return. Suggestion: call ahead for take out orders."}
{"text":"Very good Today was our first visit and it is definitely a winner!! Love the red chili sauce Excellent chicken enchiladas"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had and it's a neighborhood staple. Quick suggestion though, drive around and park out back. The front parking lot is too small and crowded."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner and it's the best I have had! The beans were so authentic and the rice was flavorful! Wish it was closer to the east valley!"}
{"text":"Great food. Some staff are ready to take your order. But they have changed a lot of things lately. We have to follow their guidelines in order to get certain deals."}
{"text":"My first time trying this hole in wall and I really enjoyed the place. A friend recommended it and I am really glad we decided to give it a try. From the outside the building isn't much to look at but, don't let looks deceive you. I had the pollo especial it is shredded chicken inside a  chimichanga style burrito. It was very tasty and seasoned well. The plate included a very generous helping of rice and beans and each had good flavor. I couldn't pass on the .99 cent margaritas which were no where indicative of the price. They were a full size. They will let you have a sample the red chili which is nice. The sauce was thick and creamy with no bitterness just lots of flavor. The service was a little slow or I'd give 5 stars. Could be because the crowds just don't stop flowing in!  Tips: the parking lot is very small and fills up quickly.  Small building, if you blink you'll miss it Lines can get pretty long Went on a Sunday"}
{"text":"I wish it was still one of West Phx best kept secrets, but anyone who knows better knows this is the beginning and the end of authentic mexican cuisine. I could hook their red sauce intravenously and be totally happy.  One gripe: Some of the hostesses are kind of young and inexperienced. I came in to order to-go once and instead of a normal greeting, she looked up and said \"Wha happen?\"  Dude... come on."}
{"text":"I ordered the fish taco, cheese enchilada and bean and cheese tostada for lunch! All 3 were a disappointment. Chips and Salsa were good! Service was good! Not as good as the reviews say! Deep fried ice cream was good!"}
{"text":"A very good transitional Mexican Food.  Unfortunately, the area of town does not have the best of reputations, however, if you get beyond that, the food is good.   Fresh salsa and warm chips, unlimited.   I ordered the carnitas chimi.  Would have preferred that it come smothered, but I am sure it can be ordered that way.  I also had the Chili Relleno.  Was not very impressed with this dish as the chili was very small and got lost in the egg.   Friend had chicken enchilada and taco.  She enjoyed this as well.   4 stars only because a place has to really stand out to get that fifth star.  I would definitely return if I am on this side of town.  Next time, maybe try a special margarita too!"}
{"text":"This place came as a life saver. One day I went to make dinner but the meat I had defrosting went bad. So we needed something quick and close by. I called the restaurant and ordered. I ordered two adult trays and one kid meal. You can't order drinks.  I thought the price seemed pricey but then again it was a restaurant order not fast food. The food took about 25 minutes (they said 15). When I got home the portions surprised me. They were pretty big sized portions. The food was good too. A bit greasy though.  We joked that it is food for someone who's got a buzz on.  Anyhow. We got good portions and the food was pretty tasty. The rating is 3 stars because when I say greasy I mean It Was Greasy!  Also the staff is kind of blah. Not really mean but I was there ten minutes waiting for food and not one server or hostess was smiling. I also smiled at a few and didn't get the return and I witnessed the hostess interacting with a waiting party and I think she could have been nicer.   (I worked in a restaurant for four years so morale is important to me)"}
{"text":"The most delicious authentic Mexican food in Phoenix by far!!! I had the green chille burrito enchilada style and the waitress gave me some jalapeño cream cheese to put on top, it was amazing!!! The wait time & serving time was fast on a Friday night as well!! It's a must!!'"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food and great service!  Everything I've had in the menu is amazing but the spinach enchiladas and raspberry margarita are my favorite!"}
{"text":"I come here for only one reason. The chips and salsa. The food is very, very mediocre (similar to the taste of Macayo's) and the service is usually less than that. In fact, there have been times where the waitresses (especially one particular waitress, with short, curly hair, who has been there forever) are just down right rude. I have gone there with about 30 different people (my school district is in the same area so everybody in my district goes to Popo's, especially on days that we have half days or professional developments), and the several times that we've gone, it NEVER fails!!!....my colleagues complain that the service is bad and the waitress is rude. I even told the manager about one particular waitress and he didn't seem to care much.  If you walk in knowing that, you'll be okay. The salsa is beyond delicious though! I am pretty picky about my salsa since I grew up in an authentic Mexican food environment and I will tell you, you'll love their salsa.  So....5 stars for the salsa, 2 and a half stars for the rest of the menu and 1 star for the service. However, because I LOVE their salsa, I wilm always come back."}
{"text":"Margaritas are the bomb especially at $0.99 on Saturdays and Tuesdays As Long as You Follow their few little rules which are no big deal. Their food is absolutely amazing so tasty and authentic. I always get the Carnitas , the pork is so tender and so juicy and so much flavor and it's so big is serving I can never finish it. My husband and I found this place about 20 years ago we used to go there when we were dating some friends of re found it and I'm so happy that they did because I love going to popos"}
{"text":"I just really like POPOS. Not exactly authentic but they are very consistent with the food and have great service. It's def a spot to try out when on maryvale, which is like never. So when I am around the way I try and stop here. I really like their machaca tacos. I always like machaca. Certain times they have $1.99 margaritas also."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food place. Been going here since I was a kid. Can't get better than this one"}
{"text":"Found this spot by chance and was pleasantly surprised. Great service and even better food. 99 cent Margaritas on Saturday to top it off!?!? Who can ask for more? Locals made sure to recommend dishes to try and my fav was the \"Pollo Burro\" Walking in to this place and seeing how many people were there was the best sign I could get that I was in for a treat. Def must go!!! Additional parking in the back if the front is full. Bon Appetite."}
{"text":"I moved to Phoenix a few months ago and my family loves this place, so I have been to Popos quite a few times now.  Every time we come I always try something different and I've never been disappointed.  Today I tried the El Pollo Especial Muy Rico and it was so amazing that I'm going to make it my standard!  Mauricio took care of us and recommended it to me and I'm so grateful he did!  Also, Mauricio did an amazing job taking care of me and my family so thank you Mauricio.  We'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This place is a far cry from it's heyday.  Went there for the first time in years today as I used to absolutely love Popo's!  I ordered cheese enchiladas with an egg over easy.  When they brought my plate, it literally looked like a hot pile of slop swimming in a ton of grease!  Once it cooled down I took a few bites, and then got a to go box.  What really sealed my one star review was when I asked for a to go cup for my full drink!  They simply said we don't have them anymore!  Wow, won't ever be back!  This place has gone to absolute crap!  Very Sad...."}
{"text":"They don't deserve 1 star.  They don't take reservations, waited 2 hours for a table for 20 , we all got seated at separate tables! Then my part (5) of us were never greeted, never took a food order from us , the server was way to overwhelmed with other tables he had... we waited 15 min. Then left. Sorry Popos.  Get your shit together, we won't be returning ..."}
{"text":"been going here forever and always go back, even got married there in the dining room with all the family i have going here with all along. one of those neighborhood treasures you grow up with and still go back to the 'hood for."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, the freshly made salsa is always amazing, the food is great and I you get a lot of food for your money. I used to live only 15 minutes away and loved going, now I moved all the way to Gilbert, and I still try and make the drive once in a while to get my fix on Popo's. I recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"This is my first time I was referred to by a friend  ,absolutely nasty I could have gotten a better meal at taco bell . I got the chicken flautas and my chicken was fried to a crisp I couldve swore at first it was beef or was so dark , the rice taste garlic buttery and as far as the beans it taste straight out of the can . They also threw a glob of sour cream on my food and litteraly a ball of cheese on it as well.  I would NOT suggest anyone who wants ACTUAL MEXICAN FOOD TO GO HERE"}
{"text":"have been in phoenix for 11yrs never notice this restaurant, went for the first time and it was great, staff was good, food was very good and prices was great. drinks are very affordable. will go back."}
{"text":"Muy authentica y delicioso!   I just could not resist giving this place a great rating, since I credit it with making me finally fall in love with Mexican food two years after moving to Phoenix.  Finally, a place that serves Mexican food that isn't afraid to be adventurous with its spices and fresh in its ingredients.  My manager described Popo's as \"the best Mexican in the Valley - hands down\" when I asked her where to take a guest for the real deal. She hit the nail on the head.  The place is NOT perfect - if you want a so-called \"better neighborhood\" then go to the counterpart on Bell Rd. - but the food is without parallel. From the spicy cheese dip to the fajitas to the Corona-battered fish burrito....I kept waiting for something to be \"just okay,\" but as we tried each other's entrees, I could see all of our eyes light up with delight.    It gets better. Not only do they have a mean 1/2 price margarita happy hour, I saw an advertisement for 99 cent margaritas on Tuesdays.  Even without specials like this, the food is moderately priced with large portions. I have since gotten take-out from the Bell location, and \"the complete\" was more than enough to feed two people.  And, joy of joys, there are actually tasty, healthy options on the menu as well! My grilled chicken salad was AMAZING. I got a side of grilled veggies last time I got take-out, and the zucchini was fresh and cooked to perfection.  My recommendation is to ignore the pawn shop next door. Be patient if the unpaved parking lot out back is full (we ended up parking at a business up the road and walking).  Wear casual clothes. Be prepared for a slight wait if you come with a large group.    The service was right on - and THE FOOD IS WORTH IT."}
{"text":"Everything except the neighboring area was great and worth repeated visits. Carnitas, shredded beef taco, shredded beef enchilada, relleno - all worthy of a second (or more) trip. Yummy. Severs were attentive and friendly.  My kind of casual dinning."}
{"text":"The food was okay, hot and flavorful, the beans were dried on the plate but that can happen with a super hot plate, the $1 margaritas they had on special were deceiving. Tasted watered down and of poor quality. I wouldn't have minded so much except I was expected to pay $7 for food to drink a watered down tasteless margarita. Service left much to be desired. The only people that were friendly at all was the busser and the waitress I almost ran over on my way to the bathroom. I'm not impressed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since I was in high school.... which was over 30 years ago. The food is awesome and the service is top notch. Whenever I feel like treating myself..... this is the place I choose to go."}
{"text":"Beef was microwaved and rock hard. Totally unappetizing and will not be back. So disappointing as I grew up with popo's in Maryvale and was looking forward to a good meal."}
{"text":"It was a 20 minute wait, for terrible food. Cheese crisp was greasy, chicken was dry, and \"chile relleno\" was all cheese and no chile"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good things about this place I just had to go try it to believe it. Unfortunately I was disappointed with the food. The service was great. Friendly waitress. Fast service. But the food tastes like any other Americanized Mexican restaurant like \"Arribas\" or \"Makayos\" there's really nothing authentic about it. Even Filibertos or Salsitas offer fresher food. I don't encourage anyone to go. I just didn't felt the authenticity of their food. The pricing on the food was good."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food I have ever had.  I have eaten at Popo's many times and have never been disappointed.  Lunch portions are large and reasonably priced and the service is always friendly.  It is a local favorite."}
{"text":"Couples date night.  Love this place,  20 years ago my husband and I found this place because we worked across the street at Smith's at that time, now frys.  This place had such great food.  Sally was our server and let me tell you she was Awesome .  Friendly & attentive this is our second time in a few months.  It had been years since we'd been here. Ours friends found it and now we are regulars again.  Their salsa is to die for.  All their food is awesome fresh and fabulous.   Never have had bad service.  Margaritas $. 99 with$7.00 worth of food.  What a great deal.  Go you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"This is some great authentic Mexican food. The chips and salsa was great. The chips were brought out warm and fresh. They also promptly asked to replenish them when they got low. The pork carnitas plate was amazing. Slow roasted pork that easily shredded. The rice and beans are legit."}
{"text":"I really love Popo's but recently have had Bad experiences there!  One of the times,  there was a new employee & didn't get my order right when I went to pick it up!  The last time this little gal at the front took my order to go, again (chili relleno) AND noticed when I took it home there was not a green chilli in it at all!!  I have been doing 'To Go' orders for close to 2 yrs. & now it's getting to be bad service for the last few times now.  Very frustrating so always check your order before you leave!!  It's the young employees who DON'T get it right!!!  I hope the owners read this!!  It's horrible!!   The food is good tho if I get the correct order...."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place based on the 4.5 star rating it had on Yelp.  After eating here I don't agree with the general consensus. I'd give it 2.5 stars if possible.   Food: Shredded beef tacos - good but not great.  Menudo soup - bland broth, small amount of meat, and massive amount of barley corn.  It includes a side of lemon, cilantro, and chives, but this didn't really add enough taste to the soup.  I've had cow stomach before (in Mexico and in Taiwan) and it was much spicier and flavorful.   Drink: There was a 99 cent special on margaritas so no complaints here.   Service:  Average.   Atmosphere: The restaurant is in a small strip mall. It's pretty sketchy. There was a cop on duty in the waiting area. Other businesses in the strip mall include a pawn shop and a liquor store.   The menu also includes a note that the restaurant isn't responsible for lost or stolen items.   Pretty certain I won't be back here."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Service was fantastic.   Chips and salsa were delish.    However, I will not be going back.  Why, you ask?  The place is filthy.  If the front of the house is that dirty, just imagine what the kitchen looks like.  The walls were covered in soda, salsa, dust, and who knows what else.   I am bummed to have found such yummy food in such a dirty place."}
{"text":"Had them cater for super bowl 50, and it was amazing!!!!  Absolutely amazing!!!  We will have them cater again"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food ive ever had i would definitely recommend popos to anyone"}
{"text":"I love this Mexican restaurant has the best spinach enchilada around great service good food"}
{"text":"As always, delicious, been coming here since I was a child, Im now 45, never been disappointed yet,"}
{"text":"The chicken enchilada is delicious, along with the chili releano. Including the sides of the rice and chips and salsa, excellent service! Very kind people, good fast service, and the location has free wifi. Also great place to watch sports on TV, many TVs around the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times over 30 years and it's always good. Salsa is quite tasty and fresh. Other reviewers are correct, not the best of neighborhoods, but never a problem.  Have ordered many things on the menu and always good, hot, and fresh. Love the two dollar beer as well! The very authentic atmosphere really adds to the dining experience as well.  Service is always very friendly, helpful, and there when you need them.  If in doubt, go!"}
{"text":"Popo's is not a place you know about, but one of those places someone takes you to.   I've been going for 10 years now with my fellow co-workers.  When we go we could all order for one another.  My choice is almost always the Machaca taco and a side of beans.  Don't forget to ask for the \"hot\" salsa as well.  My company has taken every President or Vice President that has time for lunch to this establishment when they visit Phoenix.    They have all been impressed.  That's saying a lot when you work for a fortune 150 company and your visitors travel extensively.    This is truly a hole in the wall worth visiting.  Oh, yeah, they also cater....and it's good too!"}
{"text":"I LOVE PoPo's! You really can't go wrong with anything here. Good salsas, good food, fair prices for the quality and quantity you will get.   Favorites:  Chicken chimichanga-  shredded chicken, it always tastes good to me.   Machaca beef ANYTHING-  whether you're having a Mexican pizza, chimichanga, etc.  I like the flavor of their machaca beef.  Green Chile bowl-  I usually order this with a side of jalapeño cream cheese. Very comforting and tasty!    Do try the jalapeño cream cheese, it's better than plain sour cream.  Chili relleno- whether you get it filled with meat or not, it never disappoints!   Mexican pizza-  I'm not a pizza fan but their Mexican pizza is perfect for a family. I believe they have an appetizer version, great for sharing and I've never had a bad Mexican pizza from them. Try it with chicken or machaca beef! Load it with some salsa and you'll be full and satisfied.  Carne asada burrito-  I like it with the guacamole.  I've tried a lot of things on the menu, more than what I've mentioned. Look out for the daily specials during the week. You can also find this info on their website. Come in on a Wednesday for a $5.99 burrito, it's HUGE! And not only is it huge, it's a winner. I think you have to dine in though. All I'm saying is why throw your money away at places like Taco Bell or Del Taco when you can have better quality home style Mexican food for about the same price? Places like Filibertos may have big burritos too, but their salsa is a waste of time! You really can't compare.   Lunch menu has decent prices!   The place is usually busy in the evening hours, there's parking in the back because it gets so packed! People are usually waiting to be seated- that's another surefire sign that the food is good and worth waiting for.    **The other location on Bell Rd is disappointing, if you go there, you'll notice a difference. The food just doesn't taste as good as this location."}
{"text":"The best damn Mexican food around and great value too! My husband and I drive in from Chandler just to go to PoPos!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, but service was awful. We had a large party none of whom were permitted to be seated until the entirety of out party had arrived, we were all coming from work and i didn't appreciate being pressured with \"if they aren't here soon you lose your table\" the staff was rude and I had high hopes for this place, people talk about it frequently. Would not recommend"}
{"text":"Seriously, as good as it gets!  We've been going to Popo's for well over 15 years and I cannot think of one bad experience, ever.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  The service is fast!  I can take an hour lunch break and still make it back on time.  The food is hot, fresh, and amazingly goof.  Hands down one of the best Mexican food restaurants in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Update to my last review. The bell location is up to par!    Best food, amazing salsa ( i could eat a gallon of it), good prices, and awesome staff at both locations.   I have been going to popo's for 23 years and love it just as i did the first time I had it."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant, but I can't say that anymore. Went today for a birthday lunch and was disappointed. The rice and beans were awful, but the carnitas made up for it. Staff was very attentive and kept drink glasses full."}
{"text":"Dear Popo's,     If I had a stomach made of steel and a titan digestive system I would just love you until you overflooded with love.  Unfortunately I do not, and every time I come back from a scrumtious meal from you I am full of heartburn and have a tummy ache all day long :(  Okay, away from my own selfish additives, here is the low down on Popo's Mexican Food:  Popo's is located in a small strip mall, so keep you're eyes peeled because it's easy to miss! It is a classic for west Phoenix residents and has created a permanent buzz. Right when you walk in the staff greets you and serves you like the pros they are. This establishment has stood it's ground and kept a huge amount of loyals for years upon years.   The food is served in beyond generous portions. Mountains of guacamole, sour cream and meat are piled onto the dish. Beans are rice are given an extra flair with this way-better-than-average salsa and cheese. The meat is so flavorful and juicy it's sure to be remembered.  Overall, the food is really good! However, if you are not use to eating heavy portions and extra fried food, it can be a bit rough on you. I would give Popo's four stars but due to the stomach ache and heartburn I had the rest of the day afterwards, I had to deduct a star.  If you are into big and yummy meals and have no limitations on portions and fats, then this place will be you're wonderland ;)"}
{"text":"By no means is this Mexican food.  This is American Mexican food there's a difference.  I came here because my mom enjoys this type of food verses the real thing and it was her birthday so i had to please her.  She liked it.  I hated it.  I ordered the shrimp tacos......disgusting.  They use frozen shrimp and you can taste it.  The corn tortillas they came on tasted like cardboard and then of coarse they added a tartar sauce which is watered down and gross as well.  I will not ever eat here again."}
{"text":"Wow! Authentic Mexican food. Good service. I had the smothered chicken Chimichanga with rice and beans. My wife had the chicken fajita. Chips were fresh and the salsa was delicious."}
{"text":"We had heard about this place from quite a few people.  Finally decided to go for lunch last week and was not what I expected.  I had the steak burrito with pico inside and rice and beans on the side with guac.  I have never been to a Mexican restaurant that served cream guac from a bag.  Literally the most disgusting thing I ever had.  It was not even green, more like beige creamy mint, it tasted kind of tangy and flavorless at the same time.  I took one bite and left it on my plate.  The burrito was just ok, the steak was just ok.  the place is old and very dive like.  We also ordered the margaritas that everyone was raving about....NO!  They were so tart and sour that we literally could not finish them.  If you want a good margarita and Mexican food go to Fiesta Mexicana. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"We are looking forward to coming back, one of the few gems in Phoenix I have missed. Great cheese and onion enchiladas, awesome prices on Margaritas. Definitely coming back, too many good things on the menu for a single visit."}
{"text":"I've been coming to PoPos for 40+ years and usually love it here BUT this past Tuesday will be my final visit. 99 cent Margaritas no longer exist unless you can meet all the requirements and guidelines they've mandated. So ridiculous! We 3 gals each ordered $8.50 appetizers. Ate one there & 2 to go! Appetizers & orders to-go don't qualify as a meal so 6 Margaritas were billed at $3.25 not .99 cents. Waitress & Manager want to argue and make a scene instead of resolving. They've gotten so greedy here.   We gathered to celebrate my birthday and asked for the Bday fried ice cream 3 times and it never came. Such a bummer. Thanks for the memories and good food PoPos.  We will have to find another place now.   Pass along any recommendations for good Mexican food with great yet affordable Margaritas! We need a \"re-do!\""}
{"text":"The best, food is terrific and the service is great too.  Highly recommend!!!!!  Thank you Lisa Lopez-Lugo"}
{"text":"Love this place. Been going there for years. Noticed this morning that newspaper said they got A rating from health dept. Rice and beans are great. Usually get green burrito or chimi. Tacos are good too. Tuesday and Saturday they have .99¢ margaritas. Great chips, salsa, and hot sauce. Servers are very nice and helpful too."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience in a long time.  Went there for breakfast with the fam and had a waitress who acted like she didn't want to be there in the first place.  It wasn't even busy, and it took over 10 minutes before she even came to our table to get our drink order.  The food tasted like it was from the night before.  None of us got through half of the meals we ordered, and not one time did the waitress come to the table to ask how we were doing or refill our drinks.  I finally stood up as she walked past us to serve another table and asked for our check.  Only then did she ask if we needed a box or anything.  I left pretty upset.  Soon as I got in the car I asked the fam, \"what's for lunch?\".  Not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"I remember coming to Popo's in the 90's and it was tha shiz! I'm not sure why I liked it so much. Maybe the recipe's changed since then, but it really isn't as great as it used to be. It might be that my palate has matured with all the great Mexican food I get in San Diego or maybe the thrill is just gone..."}
{"text":"We went  to Popos  this afternoon.  The food and drink was excellent as always !   Sally B our waitress was outstanding!!! She is one of the best waitresses we have ever had anywhere!!  I really can not say enough about how great she is!!  She did not miss a beat. She did not miss a thing!!!  Thanks Sally for making our great restaurant experience even better."}
{"text":"The secret to finding good Mexican food in Phoenix?!?! Forget every other place and only eat at Popo's.  The Mexican food in Phoenix for the most part is an embarrassment to me when I take visitors out to eat.  I don't know where these local Mexicans learned how to cook but it's awful.  It's been explained to me that possible because it's Sonoran style is why it's so bad.  Anyways, Popo's restored my faith and taste buds.  It's worth waiting in line and the portions are generous and delicious.  Come on down to Maryvale and eat at Popo's.  It's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Everything that we've eaten at Popo's has been very delish. Their salsa by far, is the best we've had.  My husband & I go through 2 bowls before our food arrives. With every visit, the staff has always been friendly & attentive to our time there. We went there by a recommendation and we've been going back ever since. I recommend you try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Popo's comes in at a close second to my favorite Mexican food eatery in Phoenix (La Piñata is first!). This location is also \"known\" for having better food then the on me on 59th ave but they are both very good to me! The salsa is fresh and warm chips and the retried beans are the BEST! I usually skip the beans, but not at Popo's!! I ordered a machaca beef taco and the shredded chicken burro with jalapeño cream cheese. Always one of my favorite Mexican meals. It's spicy but so good! The meals are huge so be prepared to take home leftovers but it reheats nicely. The service was very friendly and quick and it is always busy there with about a 15-30 minute wait if you go at dinner time, any day of the week. My friend ordered the fajitas which is her favorite as well. They come out hot and sizzling with all the sides. Stay away from chain Mexican places and hit up Popo's if you want some REAL Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time going. The place was pack! Very popular, very authentic Mexican food. I ordered enchiladas, they were delicious. I wish I had taken a picture of everyone's food including mine. Next time I will I will definitely be going back :-)"}
{"text":"I had the chimi with ground beef. It was WONDERFUL. The server was friendly and accommodating. He turned off the fan because we were freezing, and actually suggested the chimi as an alternative after I tried to order a very altered version of the monster burrito.   I'm from Texas, so I'm a little particular about my Mexican food, but I can't think of a bad thing to say about Popo's except that it isn't in Texas! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The chips and salsa were some of the best I've had.  A local suggested we try it and we were not disappointed.  The carne Asada burrito with jalapeño cream cheese was great.  The location of the restaurant didn't seem like the best but we didn't have any problems.  Not real fancy but it's my understanding they have been doing this for years and that says a lot."}
{"text":"The food was great and the portion sizes are huge- I ended up taking over half of my order home (The El Pollo Special). The salsa was amazing, however, it took a long time to receive our appetizer of just a cup of Queso. Overall, the service was great from beginning to end, and the food was worth the drive from the interstate.  We will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite Mexican restaurants by far . Been going here for YEARS ! had plenty of birthday dinners with family here.  The prices aren't bad either for such great food . Get the machaca and cheese quesadilla or the tacos with rice and beans even their chicken enchiladas are bomb ."}
{"text":"Awesome Tex mex enchiladas!!! Priced right.  Chips and salsa fresh and tasty!! Be sure to orderChile Con Queso with the chips.  It's fresh and delish   Server was very attentive and friendly"}
{"text":"We went here a few weeks ago with a couple of friends who love this place. It was a good experience and we were very happy with the service and the food. My husband and I split the large fajitas and it was plenty of food! The meat was pretty good and it came out steaming hot, as you expect for fajitas. I currently have gestational diabetes so I was unable to try the chips, salsa, and margaritas, so next time we go I will definitely give those a try too. It was good Mexican food, but not something I would go out of my way for. If you are already in the area, then definitely stop by. Also, expect a wait."}
{"text":"This place was great!!! The service wAs fast and the food was delicious. I would recommend asking for Jose S he was a great server"}
{"text":"This place had been here for years. Down side is the parking and wait time on werkends. But food and service make up for. Chips and hot sauce and salsa are good. Food is good and the service is out standing."}
{"text":"Why do they make you wait for 30 minutes for a table when they had many empty tables available? We ended up leaving after Frank said he could not seat us or seat us in separate tables, the whole west wall was vacant as well as the two big booths behind the register. Frank has no customer service skills and could not manage his way out of a wet paper sack, we would like to call the owner and ask him or her why the customer is never right. We ended up going to Macayos and they seated us right away, please tell Frank he can have his empty restaurant all to himself, him and the three girls that just let him do this. I am certain you will lose additional business if you keep Frank employed at your restaurant. We have been coming to popos for over 30 years and have never seen Frank, please keeps him on the opening shift, he does nothing for your business, better yet enroll him some customer service classes if you plan on keeping Frank.  Many other choices out there."}
{"text":"The place has some good burritos and tacos. I ordered carne asada burrito. They bring you free chips and salsa. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Typical neighborhood Mexican food restaurant. Reasonably priced food. For a date you will probably end up spending around $30 with alcohol. We order mini chimmis, fajitas, and some queso! The queso is thick in all the right ways. The chimis are good, chicken is better, ask for them a little crispy! Will probably be back."}
{"text":"There is definitely a reason this place has been around for over 30+ years! I came in with a group of 6 and was sat within 10 minutes on a busy Sunday afternoon. We were promptly given chips, salsa, and had our drink orders taken. The server did take awhile to come over and get our food order and she seemed very frazzled! We didn't wait long for our food and thoroughly enjoyed every bite! I'd recommend the green chili con carne (number 5) or the pick two deal. This time I got the bean tostada and red beef tamale, so yummy! I also love how big their glasses are so you're not constantly waiting for a refill, perfect. I'm sure this restaurant will be around for years to come, so go be part of the history!"}
{"text":"Been eating there for decades. Green chili chimi is fantastic, the salsa / hot sauce are as good as the best."}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service. The two ladies that helped us were very respectful and courteous. The food was great, I got the carne asada dinner."}
{"text":"Always enjoy eating here. I think it's pretty consistent. My favorite is the taco platter. My gf gets the steak fajitas. Only thing I wish they would stay on top is the cleaning the bathroom. Other than that the prices and food is decent enough to come back for more."}
{"text":"Excellent cantina food! Monster burrito was big enough for two people! Fresh chips and salsa and friendly servers!"}
{"text":"Guacamole and chips is the best. The portions are huge so think about sharing because we always think we are more hungry and than we walk out sick full."}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be...and the prices have gone up a bit...but all and all great food and usually...USUALLY...decent or good service"}
{"text":"I attended Popo's Mexican restaurant for the first time this past Sunday. I have lived in Arizona my whole life. Let me tell you, the fajitas were the best that I have found in Arizona. Also, everyone else who joined me only had good things to say about the food. The service and atmosphere was also very good. Would recommend it to almost anyone who enjoys mexican food. I cant wait to take advantage of the .99 cent margaritas!"}
{"text":"Very good local Mexican food.  I was visiting Phoenix and wanted some good Mexican food, as I can't find any in Colorado.  Everything was great and very family-oriented.  From the chips and salsa to the margaritas to the entrees everything was great and satisfied my craving for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"I love this place ! Some things you just ought to stick to If you're used to it. I love their cheese enchiladas with an egg on top. Service is pretty good for a busy day. I always recommend this place theres always something new to try here. It's been here for as long as I have been alive and I hope it stays ."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed PoPo's Chips and Salsa. That is probably my favorite on the menu. The chimichangas and chicken enchiladas are yummy! Recently the service at PoPo's has decreased... They are not hospitable, attentive, or kind. it takes away from the overall good experience. But the food is reliable that is why I say 4 stars."}
{"text":"I couldn't give no stars, so I had to give it one.  Don't waste your money here.  The most horrible Mexican food ever.  Sure, you get 99 cent margaritas on Tues., but not unless you order at least a 7.00 meal.  I had to sit through a concert with the most horrible indigestion I have ever had.  The margarita tasted like pure lime juice, couldn't even taste any alcohol.  I took all but  two bites home for the dog.  The next day I took another bite of the rice and beans, wondering if it had just been my stomach, but got the same awful taste and indigestion. horrible place to eat."}
{"text":"Maybe I ordered the wrong entrée    I absolutely love Mexican food, and have eaten at just about every Mexican restaurant in Metro Phoenix. I've read a number of reviews for Poco's Fiesta Del Sol, so I was excited to give it a try.   I want to start this review on a positive note.  The service at Poco's Fiesta Del Sol is amazing.  Once you are seated you're served a hot basket of chips and salsa and the salsa is delicious. I wish I could say the same about the rest of my meal.  On todays visit my lunch companion and I shared a chesse crisp, ground beef burrito with cream cheese, and a side of refried beans. The refried beans were dry and tasteless, the ground beef burrito with cream cheese  was very greasy and just didn't taste good.  I know some people seem to really like Poco's Fiesta Del Sol, but I'm just not one of them, maybe it was my entrée selection"}
{"text":"First and last time. Service is extremely slow, it took the waitress over 15 minutes to take my order. Queso dip took 10 minutes, but tacos came out in 3. Taco was nothing special to talk about. The queso dip was disgusting. It tasted like it was made with velveeta...I thought I came to a Mexican restaurant. Phoenix has great Mexican food, this place does not qualify. They were nice enough to take the dip off my bill since I didn't eat it, so I added another star! I realize they have the waitress overworked."}
{"text":"I I tried Popo's Mexican in Glendale, AZ at the new location off of Bell Rd. I will never return again. Horrid service, and the food was sub-par. Fried beans were microwaved, chicken tasted like water, and no cheese with the Fajita? What is everyone raving about? What a terrible restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh my poor tummy.. why oh why did I do this to myself?! The name of this place should have been called PooPoo's!! All 3 of us were pretty sick the morning after.. it wasn't pretty let me assure you!   The service here is great! Very friendly and fast.. the food well.. was hit and miss. The rolled quesadilla was pretty tasty.. a huge flour tortillas rolled with steak, peppers and cheese.. oh delish! Was thinking I would actually come back for this one. Then my red chile burro came.. looked great, nice and big covered in enchilada sauce.. then I took a bite expecting spicy goodness.. was bland and was almost all sauce, next to no meat what-so-ever.. you know how much I love meat! Dave took a bite and whispered to me \"it tastes like cat food\".. he's so wring sometimes and I thought I was crude..  Seemed everyone here was ordering fajita's.. if I ever go here again (very unlikely, bad tummy sickness and way far) I would try those.. the smell was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Visited Popo's while in town on business based on reviews and they did not disappoint. Went on a Tuesday for dinner and we were seated right away. The place was almost full even in the middle of the week at 6 PM. The menu is pretty big but the wait staff was very helpful in making recommendations as were the long time patrons seated next to us. Apparently they drive over 20 miles to get there and frequent the business. Ordered the margaritas and I have to say they were perfect. At first I thought they were a little weak but by the bottom of the glass I knew better. Only problem with the drinks is you can't order a pitcher.  We ordered the cheese dip for appetizer. I recommend getting the bowl (large) because the come with fried flour tortillas. Now I'm normally a big fan of corn tortillas but this was sooo tasty you got to try it. For the meal I ordered a chili relinno and a fish tacos. It was the best relinno I had in 30 years since a long ago trip to Mexico. The tacos was also outstanding, crisp fish, cool slaw  and a spicy sauce al on a homemade soft tortillas. My business part Dr had a chicken chimichanga  burrito style.  He never shuts up but he plowed through this thing without saying a word...hardly even looked up. I couldmtell from his reaction he was enjoying his meal. After another round of margaritas we left full and happy....great service and awesome food. I love this place so much I moved to the Phoenix area...wel maybe not...but I have since moved here and frequent this establishment every chance I get. Feel sorry for the other Mexican restaurants because they all get compared to Popo's."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal and 99 cent margaritas. The atmosphere was a little noisy but after a couple margs didn't care. I recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"You know what makes this place so AWESOME??? They haven't changed!!!! The food is the same AWESOME food today as it was in 1988 when I first experienced it! In fact, I would bet my last nickel dear Betty made her family promise not to change a thing and the food and service are top notch to this day with a huge following!! Unlike other long time restaurants in the area that now stink eh em...(Macayos). When I want a yummy cheese enchilada and machaca taco...it's PoPo's folks!!!!"}
{"text":"Ugh, where do I start? Bad service, the restaurant had a bad smell, employees did not look clean and presentable and over all the food is TERRIBLE and that is not an understatement. You can get better mexican food at a joint down the street for half the price, paid 70.00 for a fajitas entree, guacamole  and two kids carne asada burritos that is unacceptable! Had the food been good then the price doesnt matter but truth be told worst mexican food place I've been to in my entire life. Guacamole was bland needed seasoning and to me tasted like the bagged store bought guac. The burritos were bad meat was dry and tasted a day or two old (not an exaggeration) I felt terrible my kids were having this for dinner, as they love burritos and were really looking forward to it :( the fajitas rice and beans completely lacked in flavor. Again I am not exaggerating this, I would have been better off cooking boxed Spanish rice at home , chicken in the fajitas was dry and probably days old. Employees are useless when I directed the issue of my dry fajitas to the server he simply replied \"ok\" and walked away to get me my check haha what a joke!!! I decided to finally try this place since I was in the area and had read great reviews on yelp, makes me question how they get these good reviews either none of these people know good mexican food  or they're paying for fake reviews because theres no way on earth this place deserves 4-5 stars!!! Heck one star is even too much, please avoid this place at all costs this place does not offer quality food or service and they are extremely overpriced and overrated. I can name a few more places in the area with better food but this is not an advertisement, don't know how this place is still in business!!!!! P.s. salsa is not fresh, it is a canned salsa they pour into a bowl and overcharge you for it terrible terrible salsa."}
{"text":"Good food, fast service, a lot of food, we had to get to go containers (not normal for us)"}
{"text":"Food is always delicious here fast service nice chill environment! Buckin burrito is the way to go!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at this restaurant for over 25 years. They serve the BEST mexican food in town. HANDS DOWN! The atmosphere is great for families or a date night!  The parking situation can sometimes be \"interesting\" and the area isn't the BEST part of town... but well worth it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are cooks, so we look for the best. This has to be the best food, service and prices In life! We were greeted with a smile and served apitzer.chips and salsa right away. We were.served and waited on with a smile and didnt have to wait long at all. Our food was crazy steamy hot and the taste........(no words) I think a tear rolled down my face. We will never eat at another mexican resturaunt again. Popo's you have new regulars. Thank you for making this the best superbowl sunday ever!"}
{"text":"I'd heard this place was good for awhile now. Glad I finally checked it out. Honestly, some of the best Mexican food in town. Very authentic Mexican restaurant setting and the prices and portions make for happy customers. The monster burrito was so large that I could only finish half at the restaurant. That's a first. I highly recommend Popos."}
{"text":"My niece chose this establishment for her birthday lunch!  It was delicious but I have to say I couldn't hear anyone in my group!  It was so noisy."}
{"text":"This is the worst place for customer service  treat elderly people horrible will never go there again or spend a dollar its commercialize Mexican food is not authentic"}
{"text":"Seriously good Mexican food at a hole in the wall place. $.99 margaritas on Tuesdays and Saturdays. They're good ones too, nothing dinky. Only thing I've had that I didn't like was the tortilla soup- it was oily and bland the day I had it. The salsa, on the other hand, is awesome. It tastes different every time we go here, which tells me someone is making it by hand. My personal favorite is the deep-fried burrito. It is always stuffed full and piping hot. Hubby likes the fish tacos- nice fresh fish deep-fried to perfection. The last few times we've been here we've had some issues, but management has always taken care of things. It must not outweigh the good because we keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Went there for my pre birthday dinner and the reviews didn't lie! The food and service was outstanding!!! Cannot wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"Patty-cake took such great care of us. Make sure you ask to be seated in her section. The spinach enchiladas were the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley! We can always count on excellent food when we come and the servers make us feel like family. Patty Cakes and Rosie are definitely our favorites they have our order and drinks memorized! Prices are right on target for my family of five, I'd eat here every day of the week if my husband would let me. If you haven't tried this place already you should."}
{"text":"I have not been here since around the mid 90's when I used to be a frequent customer, and it was just as tasty as I remember it being! I now live in Chandler but work in downtown Phoenix so I will definitely become a frequent customer once again. The rice and beans are the best in the valley! I had a ground beef burro with green sauce, amazing! My friends had chimis and flautas which they also thought were delicious. My friend Michelle is a regular and swears they have the most authentic Mexican food in the Valley, I may just have to agree with her after I try a few more items :) I will definitely have to come by after work hours for a margarita! I grew up just 2 miles from here so it feels a bit like coming home :) Our waiter was friendly as well!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in AZ! You walk in and the place just smells sooo good, it's always busy, from open to close for a good reason so be prepared to wait anywhere from 5-30 minutes but trust me you won't be disappointed! The employees are so kind and helpful, you never have to look around for them because they are are always there when you need them. The food tastes great and are very large portions, expect to bring some home in a to-go box. I know the parking lot is small and that can be a little of a downer but I would park across the street and walk over if I had to, just to get a table :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food. I got their spinach and cheese enchiladas.. And also split a chile relleno. The enchiladas are great, the chile relleno is ok. I've had better. We also got a chili queso dip for an app. Pretty good as well. The only thing I sont like is the appearance of the restaurant outside. It looks a bit run down. The inside looks great though. All in all this place is yummy."}
{"text":"I love their chips and Salsa however,  I'm not very fond of their beans. The chimis, red chili and enchiladas are good. They do have a happy hour on magaritas. The wait can be about 20 to 30 mins long and the service is great."}
{"text":"Okay... So the last time I was here was March 2016! And before than..... I couldn't even tell you... YEARS!!! Like 10+ YEARS!! My last experience before this Monday Night was not satisfying at all. Mostly in regards to just the taste of the food. Rice and beans were not very good and I believe I ordered a chicken chimichanga. (Not bad) The food was so bad for me, I had made up my mind to never return. Until now.. Which was not by Choice.   This restaurant is some of my family members favorite Mexican food spot. (Can't understand why, but it is)... And on Mondays they like to come for the all you can eat special which is All-You-Can-Eat tacos and tostadas with a one time serving of rice and beans. It's like $10! So a very Great deal. I ordered the special and you get to pick what kind of taco you want ( Chicken, ground beef, and machaca?) or a bean tostada. I order the chicken tacos because that's all I eat is chicken. They actually tasted pretty good. The chicken was a tad bit salty but not too much where I hated it. (I hate too much salt) and the rice was really good tonight. The beans were eh. And just FYI the chips and salsa are pretty good. I always base a Mexican restaurant off their chips and salsa! To drink I ordered an ice tea with extra lemon.   So now the part which has really turned me off from this place.. Lol so The check comes and without our knowledge we were CHARGED for the 3 lemons in our teas!! I asked for extra lemon with my tea, my mom did, and my brother and his gf asked for a couple on the side with their meal. Never been to a restaurant that CHARGES YOU FOR LEMON!! It added a few dollars (like 2-4 can't remember) to the bill which is not a whole lot but it would have been nice to have been told that!! We were all so shocked that they actually charge you for lemons in your ICE TEA! That's just crazy! That's like paying for all the garnish in your drinks just to make it pretty! Idk.. Kinda ridiculous when drinks are already overpriced anyways at restaurants   So this spot is just not for me."}
{"text":"My favorite spot when I'm craving Spanish rice and chimichangas. Yum. I can never go wrong with a platter of chimichangas and a side of Spanish rice. The portions are large but all the better since I love eating it at work the next day."}
{"text":"They open at 11 am!!  I loved lunch the other day, but I'm sitting outside on the bench because Yelp said they open at 9 am.  Not any more."}
{"text":"The food is fabulous! We are visiting from Ohio and will go to Popo's 4 times in 7 days, so that tells you my opinion. I got the chimichanga with carne asada, fajita steak, and fajita chicken. All to die for, but I preferred the carne asada.  You can pick 2 different toppings-I get double guacomole because it is fresh and fabulous. The complimentary chips and salsa are wonderful. So, why 4 stars and not 5? Because of inattentive servers on multiple visits. It is not unusual to run out of chips, salsa or drinks for a lengthy period of time. Sometimes the servers just seem to pull a disappearing act. Obviously, I like the place enough to keep going back. If you are in the Glendale area, I would highly recommend Don Ruben's, which has top- notch food and service."}
{"text":"I love this place, they serve the best Mexican food that fill you up and their service is great. I'm so glad I live right down the street from there. And they also have great margarita specials!"}
{"text":"I came in since I saw so many good reviews on google and it had 4.4/5 stars. The mini chimichangas appetizer was good. I ordered the 2 chicken enchiladas with a side of rice and beans. When the food came out, the plate was piping hot, and my beans had this greasy crud from being under the warm light. My dish was so salty! The beans, the rice, the enchilada sauce was way too salty, I couldn't eat it. The chicken was good. But that was it. And the tortilla seemed too dry. Idk. I might give this place another chance with a different dish."}
{"text":"The steak Picado is worth every single calorie! Our waitress, Patty was so fun and friendly, not to mention she is a margarita BEAST! Must try the mango margarita!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch with my family had the enchilada style beef burrito, It was super salty also had the jalapeño cream cheese it was also super salty. I believe the manager never tries the food before it is served to customers. Told the server she did not do a thing or fixed our meal. Very disappointed...not real mexican food and if you have high blood pressure please save your heart do not eat there..."}
{"text":"Service was great even on a busy night was told 45 minute wait but was seated in under 20 minutes. Lots to choose from in the menu. Ordered the #3 combo which is a green chicken enchilada with a taco and rice and beans I was expecting a small enchilada is was more like a burrito very good and plate was over flowing with food. Food was brought to take pretty quick as well. First time visiting and we will be returning."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!   This small family run restaurant is OFF THE HOOK SO GOOD!!!!!  The staff is amazing and attentive the food is the best I have had since moving to the valley from California.  I have since been by their twice since my first experience and both times there has been a line down the sidewalk..ensuing this place is definitely one of the best around.  Don't let the outside of the building and really small sign fool you...this is a must try if you are in the mood for authentic Mexican and the homemade chips and salsa rock too."}
{"text":"As a family in the neighborhood we've been to popo's for 40+ years, often walking there from home or after school. Something has changed in the past few years and this weekends visit is most likely my last. The service has slipped considerably. I work in a kitchen & understand being busy, but the server openly sneered at us when we asked for my son's water refill (for the 4th time!) Other servers and the host outright ignored us. This is a systemic failure, this isn't one person or one day, they have been getting worse for years and it's finally broken me.  It's a shame because this is where we'd normally bring our out of town guests. I'll be checking yelp for their replacement."}
{"text":"A girl friend & I went to this place based on the rave reviews of a coworker. When we parked we thought about maybe reconsidering our decision because it didn't look quite that appealing.   Thank goodness we stayed! As soon as we walked in the yummy smell hit us. The place is simple, nothing fancy, but the food is good (we shared a sampler, which filled us both to the brim), reasonably priced & the Cadillac Margaritas are STRONG. The waitress was very nice & didn't rush us when it was closing time,,,,, it took us a while to finish those Margaritas, lol. If you have more than 1 I have 2 words for you. Designated Driver :)  Great place to come for a casual dinner or lunch with coworkers or friends. Not a place to take a date if you're trying to impress them :)  It's in a strip mall with limited parking, on some days I've heard you have to be there early to get a parking space & a table. We went late on a Friday night & had no issue with either though."}
{"text":"Popos is pretty much the only decent place near work that I can suggest for a dinner date.  It is somewhat of a Maryvale institution and I am proud to support any Maryvale institution that isn't an obnoxious chain.  That being said, I've only been here a few times (despite working five minutes away for almost three years) but I'm always full and happy.  I stick to the decadent spinach enchiladas which are cheesetastic to say the least.  The salsa is spicy and awesome, and the chips come warm.  On Tuesdays and Saturdays they offer $.99 margaritas.  Seriously.  I had my first one and thought it was weak, but was pretty sure there was a decent amount of tequila in it by my second one.  What cost 99 cents anymore?!?    Parking is obnoxious to say the least, and I'm not sure that I'd hang out here too late into the evening.  It is great for a early happy hour dinner, though!"}
{"text":"Their food is great, best I've had since I last visited South Tucson. Salsa is always fresh, and each time it tastes just a little bit different so you can tell (at least I think) it's made by hand.  And every Tuesday and Saturday, 99 cent margaritas with a meal purchase (limit 4, so you can't exactly get trashed) but these aren't dinky solo cup margs either, they're well worth the trip alone.   A+ would eat again.  I have heard that the other location is not quite as good as this one, so buyer beware. Make sure you're in the right...ahem...neighborhood."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing food. Have been here several times and loved it each time. Service is great and they have good drink/happy hour specials."}
{"text":"this is my favorite spot for Mexican food I mainly go on Mondays during the lunch special for all you can eat tacos, rice and beans The Price is Right and I get my eat on!!! let me tell you Tuesday's specials at lunch time is the margaritas between 11 and 3 you can get them for a 1.99  they are wonderful. I can't get enough of this place"}
{"text":"THE FOOD GET 1 STAR  AND THE SERVICE IS -1STAR  I WAS THERE AND GOT THE \"FISH TACO PLATE....... the food finally came and the plate looks good.i was hungry. i ask the waitress for more lemons. since it only has one slice on the plate. im sure its not a big deal. the waitress was telling that they charge for lemons.. and is it going to be ok with me. i was like really your going to charge for lemons.and she said yes and she was sorry. i have two fish tacos and one small size lemon. i was like WTF. are U really charging for lemons. when you order fish tacos. so I just enjoy my tacos and it was not the best terrible, oversalted, overgreased. i can make it better at home. At the end we ask for the tab. she came back with a bill that has service fee. for $12, there are only 3 of us. she added the tip for her self like we are not going to see it. So we ask why is there $12 service charge. you only do that if there are like 6 or more on most places.in your table. She came back and was telling us that she handed us the wrong bill. Then handed us the new bill. without the service charge same bill. turns out she was doing that to all her table.she wanted to tip her self and wait for the costumer to tip again. we used to go there two times a week. NOW I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN. AND BY THE WAY THIS IS MY FIRST REVIEW OF A PLACE THAT I HAVE TO TELL PPL ABOUT. DONT GO THERE IF YOU WANT GOOD SERVICE. SHE GOT A big fat $O.000 tip"}
{"text":"Not my favorite Mexican - chili relleno which was a bit greasy hubby got steak quesadilla and I must say it was delicious.  Chips and salsa we fresh"}
{"text":"my wife really enjoy the 99 happy hour margaritas. and surprisingly my kids under 6 and 4 really enjoy the chips and salsa family oriented place indeed. im all for the mini platter"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice with friends and both times very good. I have no complaints except you may have to wait on a Saturday or Sunday night. Even then we didn't wait long.  Excellent Mexican food, I had the beef chimichanga which was absolutely delicious.  Basically everything good and the staff even though busy are warm and ready to serve.  Go check it out, and will not break your pocket$$$$."}
{"text":"Had another great meal at PoPo's on Saturday. I took off one star for 2 things. #1: almost all of our silverware was dirty..very dirty #2: The 99 cent margarita gave me a sour belly..too much sweet & sour"}
{"text":"I go to popo's alot. Rosie is our waitress she is awesome.  I always have good service there with everyone.  When I  have family and friends come to visit I take them to popo's no where else. The food is fish always great.  And so are the margaritas. Lol."}
{"text":"They sat our party within 10 minutes. That was great since we had 10 people in our party.  The salsa and chips were very good. I also had the house Margarita that was excellent. The carne Asada tacos were very juicy and great tasting. The only thing I didn't like was their beans. They were very salty."}
{"text":"Nothing stood out for better or worse, such that I  would not seek it out nor would I reject going back  Big portions for a decent price, but again, kinda run of the mill."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for over 3 years and have NEVER had a bad experience. We have numerous choices for Mexican food places and Popos is our first choice! Salsa is excellent, food is always hot and tasty! I recommend totally! When we don't feel like getting out, we call and order to go."}
{"text":"Popo's is \"hit or miss\" for me.  My husband loves it and I feel like it's inconsistent.  The first time I went the chicken chimmichanga was great, the next two visits, the chimmi was bland and I had to ask 2-3x for drink refills and napkins, the staff just wasn't on their A game. The parking situation at Popos is really challenging and we have pulled in with the intention of dining there but left because there was just no parking."}
{"text":"Food is great!     Hostesses are always rude when you have a big party!    Plan parties elsewhere"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican cuisine. Large portions and delicious. Moderately priced. You can feed the whole family.  Service was good"}
{"text":"I thought this was a little secret that I was going to keep for myself, but since a few others have spilled it, I should add my review.   Popo's is a west side institution. When i needed to get my auto-brakes done, i asked someone at work where to go. They told me about a repair shop and the directions to find the place were, \"it's over by Popo's.\" It was that way about a lot of things.... They were always at the same intersection as Popo's.... or right next to Popo's.... or down the street from Popo's. When i asked what Popo's was, i would get open eyed stares.... in the community where i work, not knowing about Popo's is unthinkable.... so... off we went after work one day.   To say that the place is unpretentious is an understatement. From the outside, the place looks downright seedy. The building looks as if it is half vacant... the far end of the row of shops houses a drive through liquor store... and you get the feeling that it is that way because the parking lot is unsafe. Don't be fooled. It may look like a page out of Urban Blight magazine, but the people i have met in that neighborhood are warm, and friendly, and you are perfectly safe. I say this because, now.... when i take friends there for lunch, the usual response as we turn in the parking lot is a very leery \"Where are you taking meeeee!?!?!\"   All the looks of fear and suspicion disappear once we go in... and by the time they have had their first mouthful of fundido, they are hooked on Popo's forever.   The margaritas are huge and happy hour prices are cheap... My favorite is the frozen raspberry, or just a normal unfrozen margarita. I think I'm the minority because most of the ones delivered to my table are usually strawberry. They have a good selection of beer as well.   Of all the appetizers, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Queso Fundido... the one with spinach is to die for. At this moment, I'm drooling at the thought, and considering going there tonight. Sometimes I'll go wild on chips and have the fundido for my meal.   My favorite entree there is the seafood enchilada, despite it being made of krab vs. crab. There are many levels of dining and i consider this \"fun dining\" as opposed to \"fine dining\" so while i rarely excuse the use of fake seafood, i will make an exception here. Second to that, i like the spinach enchilada, the tacos, and almost any kind of fajita they have. I've never had their red tamales but the green ones are tasty. I've never gotten a burro but friends have... and they go back for more.   I don't know if they have entertainment every night, but last Friday they had a Mariachi band wandering through the place. It was great for my group of friends because we were having a send off dinner for a friend who is moving to Florida.... and of course, we took the obligatory photo of her with the mariachi band when they got near our table.   Popo's is great for groups. The place is fun and friendly. I've never had a bad experience there... and since it's Cinco de Mayo, i just might be there tonight."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! A little bit disorganized getting us seated (party of 6) but after that it was great. Diego was our server and he was the most professional and sweet guy. We loved him. Our food was delicious, GIANT portions. I think we all took leftovers home! You can't go wrong on the menu here.   My only complaint would be the margaritas. Two of us ordered a basic house margarita on the rocks with salt, and they were so weak I couldn't taste ANY tequila. Very very weak."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. They refuse to take a take out order in advance and literally told me I had to call back 10 minutes before I want the food. Get it together"}
{"text":"My partner found this out of the way gem in a crappy small strip mall. Park in back.  Doesn't look like much from the outside but the nice faux finish décor and segregated dining areas on the inside make up for it.  We had the Pollo Especial and The combination Red & Green chili plates. The red chili is amazing.  I am typically more interested in chili verde but the red chili is terrific. Be sure to request corn tortillas with this plate instead of the usually served flour tortillas.  The bean and rice are great.  The rice is moist & flavorful. If you are choosing between the queso dip and the spicy bean dip, go with the bean dip it does have cheese in it with great flavor, not too spicy either.  The Pollo plate is great, it is one of the most popular dishes on the menu, however, to me the least Mexican.  Try the steak or chicken picado.  I did not try the menudo but everyone around us was ordering it, which looks delicious.  We were there on a Sunday around noon, shortly after we were seated & ordered the place began to fill up. By the time we left there were several parties waiting for tables. There is a nearby church and everyone was there following services.  So if you go on Sunday for lunch, get there by noon.  The food has incredible taste and is quite authentic.  There are a lot of Mexican restaurants in Phoenix Metro as you can imagine, but there are not a lot of good Mexican restaurants.  This is a very good restaurant.  The salsa is made fresh daily & you can tell, it has great flavor (I would prefer it more spicy). Our waitress was great, smiling, attentive, and serviced well.   Next time I will order a bowl of the Red Chili with corn tortillas.  I don't need the rice and beans just a giant bowl of that delicious Red Chili."}
{"text":"The food here is really good... All of their courses... Their chips and salsa is amazing.  I have been here a couple times and have gotten their house special both times... A chicken burrito like dish.  It is really good and prepared well... My only knock on this place and keeping it from truly getting 5 stars is that I wasn't impressed with the quality of chicken used.  I don't want to sound like a snob or anything but if they used white meat chicken breast I'd come much more regularly.  The fried ice cream is to die for.  The service can be a little slow on busy days but they are always friendly.. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I used to go there on a regular basis with friends.  Hadn't been there in years and went to eat on Wednesday night.  I ordered an enchilada, rice and chicken flauta.  The enchilada sauce was really salty, the rice was greasy and garlicy and the rolled flauta took the shape of an ice cream cone.  All was disgusting.  VERY DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"The food when we got it was good. But hell the service wasn't so great. We got seated in no time, our server just looked pissed off. There was a decent amount of people in the restaurant but not to many that she couldn't come take our order. And if we wanted a refill on our drinks good luck finding someone. Only poor experience was the server. Plus usually they come around to see how everything is.. Yeah didn't happen. Everytime I saw her she looked pissed off. :("}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the west side of phoenix and Mauricio best server that works there ......."}
{"text":"They open at 11:00 to 9:30pm wrong hours posted. They have great food and the service was excellent. Thank you Popo's for a great experience"}
{"text":"Yeah back in the day I would have rated a 8. I have been going here since my parents were carring me in the restaurant. It used to be much smaller until they bought the bar next door and expanded. Then they opened another in mesa and now on bell rd. As many people know the bigger the restaurant gets the less it is like the mom n pop joins I LOVE. Also I used to go there many moons ago and eat the WONDERFUL chips and salsa and tuesday or saturday $0.99 margaritsa and walk out with a $5 dollar tab. Now you must order a combo plate or a min of 7or 8 bucks to qualify for the 99cents margarita. I usually stick with the happy hour $3 dollar margarita and chips n salsa.  Dont get me wrong I still eat here. :) Happy eating  Good eats here: chicken fajita burro quesadilla chimichanga fajita"}
{"text":"Oh, Popo's....  How do I love thee...  Let me count the ways!  having lived in the area for more than 20 years, Popo's has been and likely will always be the best mexican food around.  We worried heavily when they opened their new location at 59th and Bell because it can often signal the beginning of the end (such was the case with Garcia's).    Popo's is a family restaraunt.  A bit rough on the edges with the decor but the food and service are far more worthy of a visit than any decor.  I often look intently at the menu hoping that I would find something that could sway me from my usual choice but I somehow always seem to default to the Chimi dinner.  Sure I would love to try other items but I feel as though I would miss the chimi just a little more.  So, for me it's the chimi dinner with machaca, red sauce, guacamole, and their delicious jalapeno cream cheese.  The machaca (shredded beef) is absolutely amazing and if I could make it myself I would never have to venture out again.  Add to that their salsa (which has the right amount of saltyness and that addictive red hot sauce and you will be set for an incredibly filling and delicious meal.    The service is exceptional.  Like family really.  The beer is cold and the drink specials are always fun.  We have always had a great time and look forward to each visit.  We have tried many other Mexican places over the years but this place takes the blue ribbon.  Incidentally, we have a home in Texas as well and our Mexican food experiences there have been less than spectacular.  The TexMex - Fresh Mex idea is a completely different type of dining and it lacks the depth of flavor and preparation that Popo's is expert at.    For a south of the border treat, check it out and enjoy!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best margaritas I have EVER had and I have had plenty.  I love that no matter how busy they get, the ladies are fast with my order. I love coming here on Tuesdays or Saturdays for their .99 margarita special. My favorite meal is the chimi with jalapeño cream cheese. To die for! I love this little restaurant! Best Mexican food place for me."}
{"text":"Wait was long, food wait was long.. decent tasting food. Authentic Mexican food.. just the wait made it a exausting dinner. Alittle more onions then necessary"}
{"text":"A friend of mine from Gilbert called me saying she is craving Popos. I introduced her to the restaurant a couple of months ago when NASCAR came to town. She immediately fell in love with the food, friendly prompt service. She could not believe how delicious the red sauce was. Actually the whole plate of food. So good that she was craving Popos again. She drove from Gilbert this Friday evening so we could enjoy dinner there. Again we were not disappointed. She had green chili burrito with red sauce on top. She loved the green chili. Also got her fix of the red sauce. LOL. For a Friday night, service was prompt and friendly again. Great job Popos showing our side of town has great restaurant service and food."}
{"text":"A good friend introduced us to this place a while back. I was a little hesitant at first as it's In the end of a little strip mall. Parking is NOT fantastic, but you know a place is good when the parking lot is full. It's the closest I've found to my favorite little hole in the wall restaurant back home in Texas. My favorite are the beef the enchiladas. Their chips are always fresh and salsa fantastic. The portions are huge and always served super hot! Love this place. For the $$ the food is fantastic, service is prompt, and always worth the drive!"}
{"text":"So sad!... I have been to Popo's many times in the past... I have not been there for a couple years... But my spouse and I decided to go out for dinner and chose to eat at popo's  with much regrets... So sad to say... The service was very, very, very poor!... The server and he brought my food out he threw my plate on the table and it hit my elbow... Not only that the salsa is not good at all, it was a bunch of chopped up onion in canned whole tomatoes is what it tasted like... I was very and please I know I can make better salsa at home... I ordered a chicken taco and it was very small and very salty... We will not be going back to this place at all... The wait was he very long to be seen in the customer service is very rude never got a glass of water when I asked for it very unpleased!... I did speak to the manager her name is Vicky and all she had to say was \"oh! Well if the server was rude just don't tip him...\" wow! That's OK I hope I love you will think twice about going back to pope owes if you go there..."}
{"text":"Really good food and really good salsa. Place was crowded for lunch but they got us in and out quickly."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, we had a party of 10 we were waiting on 2 people to show up and they had our table all ready, however they would not seat us till all parties arrived. We left! Good job on missing out!"}
{"text":"I have dined at almost all the Phoenix, Arizona \"Phoenix Style\" Mexican Restaurant's in town in my fifty years in Phoenix. \"Popo's\" is the best I know of from the Taste to portion sizes, Salsa, Chips and Service \"Popo's\" is the place to go!!  Thank You, Popo's, Jerry"}
{"text":"This is a difficult review for me as Popo's  used to be my favorite restaurant. I don't know if it switched owners or what, but the quality and taste of the food has seriously diminished over the last couple of years. My family and I have been coming to Popo's for over 20 years and now when it's suggested for dinner it meets a resistance it has never known. I've been holding off on this review hoping they would fix their issues, but it's become clear that won't happen. At this time, they have the worst Mexican food in Phoenix. Everything taste pre-cooked and bland. The salsa, which use to be excellent, taste like it comes from a can. I'm beyond disappointed. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up."}
{"text":"My sisters and I went here yesterday, Sunday at 2pm.  My one sister lives close by so she has been a few times already.   To our surprise they were still very busy.  We had a 15-20 minute wait but it actually took 30 minutes to be seated.   As we waited even more people came in.  It was so packed that we thought, \"Damn this place must be really good\".  Our beverage order was taken and brought promptly.    The time between ordering our food and getting it was only about 10 minutes or so.  For it being so crowded I thought we'd have to wait much longer.    I ordered the chicken chimichanga with jalapeno cream cheese on top with a side of rice and beans.  Yummy.  The cream cheese gives it the extra flavor that just makes the chimi oh so good.   Everything had so much flavor.  Nothing bland here.   The best Mexican food I have tasted.    The two sisters shared a plate which had, 1 toastada, 1 machaca taco, 1 beef enchilada, rice and beans.  They too enjoyed their food.  My one sister doesn't care for red enchilada sauce, however, the way Popo's makes theirs, is different.  It doesn't have that strong red flavor.  It's tones downed with something else.    Everything was delicious.  I wish we had one close to where I live.    I knocked a star off bc the staff could be a bit more friendly.  There were no friendly smiles here to be found.  They weren't rude, but not friendly either."}
{"text":"Great food, decent prices. Chips n salsa are so good.  Come hungry,  leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Went there on a whim last night. Mondays are all you can eat Tacos. Started out with the Spinach Con Queso dip and the All You Can Eat Tacos. The first plate was 2 Machaca Tacos with Rice and Beans. Each refill was 2 more Tacos. As a Taco Lover I have to say these where some damn fine tacos. I will be going back. Likely many times."}
{"text":"I love, love this place! There is always a bit of a wait during dinner hours but always worth it! If you want real authentic Mexican food this is it!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! Best Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"My wife and I were really looking forward to eating at Popos. Our chiropractor  said he really enjoyed Popos. The Yelp reviews were positive.     We had a 20 minute  wait before we were seated.  We were served chips and salsa. The salsa was really really good. We were seated next to a  birthday party with maybe 25-30 people. We ordered the jalapeño poppers which took almost 1/2 an hour to arrive. For our meal we ordered two taco platters.  It was over an hour before two fish tacos and one carne asada  taco to finally arrive. My wife and I had ordered the same thing something we seldom do. We usually order lots of variety  and split everything.  The rice and beans looked ok. The tacos not so much. They were each wrapped in two cold tortillas. It's as if they took them right out of a package without any preparation. The tacos looked weird in those tortillas,very unappealing. I grabbed the tortillas and put them to the side.and started to taste the insides of a fish taco. The flavor and the quality was horrible. My wife was having the same experience. Neither one of us had tried the Carne  asada taco. At this point we told the waiter of our displeasure. He asked if we wanted to get something else. After waiting so long we said no thank you."}
{"text":"I go here everytime I'm in Phoenix, both times that I've eaten there so far have been amazing. I love seafood and their seafood enchiladas are to die for. The portions are huge so I get another meal or so out of them. Definitely coming back everytime I'm in town."}
{"text":"It was our first time here. We pulled up to a full parking lot, walked in to full waiting area. Hostess greeted us right away with a smile and offered drinks. The sangria margarita was great, and our drinks were given to us in about two minutes. With a twenty minute wait, we were seated in ten. We ordered our food and got it twenty.. If that. The whole staff worked as a team with a smile and efficiency. I even ran into a group from Nashville staying in Litchfield Park, who drove all the way from the Wigwam resort to eat here, by recommendation. Funny story is, it was their second night in a row there!! It is that good! My date had the carne asada plate and couldn't stop raving about it! I had the green chili chimi dinner, and was blown away. I normally don't leave reviews and am very critical about customer service! This place is a 20 out of 10!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Service is terrible. Been coming here for years. Service lately is getting worse and worse. Getting to the point that, as good as the food is, it is not worth it."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant, but not anymore. I've been going here for over 15 years. The service was very slow. I had to get up and ask for a wait staff. They didn't ever come back to refill or drinks. But the most upsetting thing was the food. I had a chimichanga that tasted like old oil that it was fried in. There wasn't a good taste of the beef machaca had no flavor other then beef. I feel that there has been a change in management or the restarant has been sold to someone else. I will never go back again."}
{"text":"Good food. Huge portions. Decent service. Great salsa. Lots of TV's. Chimi couple have been more crispy. Classic Mexican American food. Great beans and rice. No horchata was a bummer."}
{"text":"Have never had a problem with this place! Go here about 4 to 5 times a month. The price is comparable to the food, the service is great and the food taste great!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since 1986. Hands down, the best Mexican food in town. I'm in the Air Force and have lived all over the country. I have yet to find Mexican food anywhere else that can compare to Popo's.  Every time I come back to Phoenix for a visit, Popo's is the first stop I make. Excellent rice! Don't forget to ask for the red sauce with your chips!"}
{"text":"This place was great!  Awesome chips and salsa, very fresh chips came out warm every time. Sangria on the rocks, rocked my world it was delicious and we had the steak fajitas, came out on the skillet, it was like each fajita was hot off the stove no worries about cold food. We were a group of 12 and the service was just amazing."}
{"text":"I have to say that I love PoPo's...OMG! The food reminds me of my mom's home cooking and I admit it I am sooo picky when it comes to Mexican food. I am not crazy about the Indian School Location, it's pretty ghetto but the food is awesome. I don't mind driving to the new location on Bell Road cuz it's way better. The staff could be a little more professional but most are GREAT. I am crazy for their salsa.."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years now, I've always had a great experience with this restaurant. The service is always great and the food is amazing ! I usually get the Mini Platter (feeds two!) or the Santa Fe Salad they are delicious ! The happy hour is great ! And they do margarita specials on Tuesdays and Saturdays ! I recommend Popo's Fiesta Del Sol to all my friends when they are craving Mexican food !"}
{"text":"Soo good! Went on a Tuesday for the .99 cent margaritas and was impressed. Ordered a chicken chimichanga and it was probably one of the best I've ever had. Margaritas were great too, my friend and I had 3 each! Absolutely cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place?  I am pretty ashamed of myself for that and its a disservice to you my readers. I apologize!!!  This place is in the Maryvale area of Phoenix. They have fantastic daily specials, especially on Tuesday and Saturday. Why you ask? Good Question! 1.00 Margaritas with purchase on an entree limit 4 per person. Frozen or on the rocks and they are tiny. (Granted they are not the 1/2 gallon bucket glasses but 2 of them and I am happy, 4 of them and I am time traveling!)  Now for the food. Best. Mexican. Food. In. Arizona.  I do not say that lightly, growing up in Arizona I lived in Tucson for my childhood only to move up here to where it is hotter in my early 20s. I have had my fair share of Mexican restaurants here in town, and we have ALL been to a (Fill-in-blank)bertos.  I could drink the salsa by the gallon here. The tamales are amazing, the seafood enchiladas are wonderful, and the fajitas are to die for!  They have a ton of TV's to watch sports with too.   The Bell Rd. Location is really good as well, but there is just something about this location that has be driving back down here even though the other one is closer.   I highly recommend going, and you may drive right by it if you aren't careful. Its tucked away next to a pawn shop in a strip mall on the North side of the road. (More parking in back).  Go. Its worth it!"}
{"text":"Quality is exceptional, prices reasonable, take out convenient. Like some others, the customer service was subpar. If they could offer service equal to their food, this place would excel. They either don't know how to improve the service, or don't care. It's a shame. The food will keep me coming back.   When calling to order take-out, I have never been told before today by any business \"I'm really busy, can you call back later?\". Wow."}
{"text":"More Tex Mex uninspired food.  Salsa was bland.  Albondigas was marginal.  Service was good and prices were fair.  This cannot be the best Mexican in Phoenix can it?"}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was 3 years old. It has never failed!  Love love love this place beyond reason. The El Pollo Especial is the best, but many others are close runners up."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to go. Great Mexican food and I always get the best customer service! I would definitely recommend for people to try any of thier chimis!! Cannot go wrong with any of them."}
{"text":"Finding the parking lot full on a Thursday night, we figured Yelpers were right on spot again.  The salsa and guacamole were delicious, though the chips were nothing to shout about.  My carnitas burrito was scrumptious, full of chunks of carnitas that were crispy and tender.  Our waiter Julio was friendly and professional too."}
{"text":"Very popular spot for tourists as well as locals. Wait time can at least an hour during busy times. The food would be worth the wait. Fortunately for us. We got here on a Sunday night about 7 pm. We had no wait at all! The food we had was amazing. Full if flavor and authentic to the area. The salsa on the table was pretty spicy but delicious. Come hungry because the serving sizes are enormous!! We ordered 3 plates to share between 4 people. At the end we were stuffed beyond measure and still had a full to go box left.  All the previous reviews were right. Don't miss this spot. It is a small restaurant in s strip mall limited seating but again well worth it."}
{"text":"First sorry I didn't take pics, I was so enjoying my food that I just forgot. Anyway, the food here was very good, the only reason I give them 4 stars is both of my carne asada tacos, the beef was tasteless, kindof scary, but my sons mini chimis where great, daughters mexi pizza was good, wife's especial pollo burrito was excellent. P.S. The fish taco I had was really good. And the portion sizes are very big. None of us could eat it all. That's a rarity any more. Good job popo's!!!"}
{"text":"Really good chips and salsa. I got the monster burrito and  I'm still not hungry the night after! Ha ha good prices too!"}
{"text":"Just ok. Nothing to really complain about. It just reminded me of the poor cousin of Macayos,and Macayos does it better."}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but my recent 5 star review is coming down.  Why?  Well,  something bad is going on at Popo's.  On our last two visits we were underwhelmed with the service and the very last time we went (only 3 days ago) the food was sub-par as well.  We know they are in the process of opening a second location and hope that this sudden decline in awesomeness is due to that situation.  Don't know, but until things improve, I'm gonna not drive out of my way to visit.  Such a pity, as this place had amazing Sonoran style Mexican food.  My favorite thing on the menu was their incredible authentic rice which was undercooked and just plain not good on Friday night.  My next favorite thing is their salsa which tasted fine but was not properly prepared (huge chunks of uncleaned peppers and big pieces of cilantro) so it was off putting.    Oh, please, will the Mexican Food Gods of Phoenix not let Popo's suffer the same failures as so many of their sister/brother mexican/american restaurants have suffered?  Seems like once they expand, the thing that made them so fantastic in the first place is lost forever.  I'm gonna go sit in the corner and cry awhile."}
{"text":"My family went to Popo's for dinner tonight and we really enjoyed it. The service was excellent (ask for Whitney), the food came out quickly and everything tasted very good. Some of the best mexican rice I've had, and my chicken burrito enchilada style was really good as well. Portions are very large. My husband had the $.99 margarita and said while you can tell it only costs a dollar, it was good for what he paid for it. No complaints. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My kids and I love this place. Best chimis. Chips and salsa are really good. I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"As visitors to Phoenix this past weekend, our group decided we wanted some delicious Mexican cuisine. We found a review for this place online and drove about 20 minutes (to what seemed like BFE) and finally arrived with hungry bellies. We were greeted by all 5 of the ladies standing near the entrance who seated us quickly. Our waitress arrived at our table quickly for our drink orders and was quite helpful.   My only complaint about the service is that my friend's father wanted to try their $4 Rita-tini (?) that was advertised on the wall that was made with 3 Amigos Tequila. When he asked for the $4 special, we were told it was strictly for happy hour. The sign itself said absolutely nothing about happy hour - and the only reason I mention this is because every other sign in the bar that offered a drink special -only for happy hour- designated that clearly on the sign. The waitress wasn't amused when he jokingly asked if she could make an exception.   Our meals were simply delicious. The carne asada was easily the best carne asada I've ever had, and being from Southern California I would like to think we have quite the selection. I personally ordered a 2 Chicken Tacos plate, which included rice and beans. The chicken was cooked differently from any other place I have ever been to, it was incredibly juicy and surprisingly flavorful.   I couldn't pin point exactly what the other people at my table had ordered, but we were all settling into food comas shortly after commencing our delightful lunch (which wasn't the best thing considering we all had a 5 hour drive to make back to California).  If I ever find myself in Phoenix again, or even somewhere remotely close by- I would definitely stop in for another meal."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is such a fav for so many people. I thought it was \"ok\" but nothing that I would drive to. The $99 margs were great value and tasty but warning that they are VERY sweet and cant be altered to make less sweet.  Food was gringo mex food typical of AZ restaurants. I had the fajita salad and would definitely not order again not because it wasnt good but because it was completely average and didnt have many faj veggies .   Chips and Salsa were also typical avg mexican- nothing special or flavorful.   The one plus was our server who was very sweet. She was slow since it was busy for $99 margs but she was extremely cheerful and as attentive as she could be for as busy as she was."}
{"text":"Came in from L.A. and decided to try this place based on reviews.  It was a little sketchie at first based on the outside but once we came in it was all ok. This place was packed. That's always a good sign. Despite the long line, we were seated before the estimated wait time. The server came to take our orders quick and our drinks and food came out pretty fast.  I had the seafood enchiladas which were exquisite. My boyfriend had the Pollo especial...it was a huge fried chicken burrito. The portions here are huge here!  Service was great, prices are really good for the quality of food and portions. We will definitely come back next time we are in town (Dodgers Spring Training). Only draw back is parking."}
{"text":"I visited this location on a little road trip with coworkers and walked out happy! The margarita special at lunch is amazing- 99 cents, and it isn't small or watered down. The chicken chimi was delish, and the prices were great. Fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"This place has been in the valley since my Dads family first moved here and it has always been delicious and reasonably priced. It's best to order your food and pick up later however since the resturant tends to be quite noisy. It is Definitely worth the drive (glendale area)."}
{"text":"not only have i been going here since i was a wee one, so has mi mum. yes, the food is that good, consistently! when i lived in sf and came to visit this was my first stop in town...i missed it terribly. so i came back, for you popo's...well, not really. the things i love: cheese crisp, mexican pizza, the complete, chimichanga! also, for some reason the sarsaparilla just tastes better here. my 1 year old loves their salsa so much that she refuses to share, i kid you not. in fact she tried to drink it. like i said, it is that good here."}
{"text":"Love this place. Have had several things. Love the Taco Grande, the chimichangas, the green chili but my most favorite off all is the Mexican pizza with machaca meat.. Food is always great and so has the service been. You should try it."}
{"text":"Popo's is as good as it gets for Mexican food here in the west valley. The food is flavorful and relatively well priced. The atmosphere is decent, though there is frequently a line during the busy times. They portions are humungous, I have yet to walk away without a doggy tray. Every time I go I try something new and I have yet to be disappointed. I've been to both locations, 67th and Indian School and the new one on 59th and Bell and both are the exact same food wise. My favorite thing I have tried there so far is the Machaca enchiladas. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a good sit down Mexican meal!! Just remember to bring your appetite, your gonna need it :)"}
{"text":"My family has gone to Popo's at least a few times a month for over 30 years. Best mexican food in Phoenix...hands down. as another reviewer said only intelligent people are the one's who give this place 4 or 5 stars. Their food is awesome (try the three cheese  enchiladas topped with an egg, and beans. $10.79 that make this place my favorite restaurant , or their three chicken or machaca tacos and rice. $10.79    They are the best I've ever had ) Pope's does serve the strongest $3.00 House Margaritas anywhere and I don't think anybody anywhere can drink more than two, they really are that strong ! And service  was fantastic and friendly. Me and my family will always come here  no matter what other customers say  ...God bless Po Po's and I hope these low star reviewers find themselves at Filaberto's since they cant appreciate quality mexican food .."}
{"text":"This place is the best! Seriously I'd you find PoPo's you've found one of the best Mexican food places in all of Arizona. The food is always delicious, fresh, and did I mention delicious!? The servings for one plate is huge!   I can eat but I can't finish a plate of food by myself. I've seen a lot of people share a plate. Now sometimes it can be a madhouse, just the other day I heard a guy ask for a party of 30 people!! But they were accommodating, and friendly.   But no joke no matter what the wait, it's completely worth it. I love this place and while I haven't gone for the margaritas yet I hear nothing but good things about it. And one day, when I get a DD, I'm going for margaritas! Love PoPo's!!"}
{"text":"Normally really good but today I found an Ear Ring in my take beans, and that is just unacceptable."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner a week or so back and ordered a cheese crisp and chicken chimichanga. Both were pretty good but nothing different than you'd get at Manuels, Garcias or Macayos. Worth checking out if you like standard Mexican chain restaurant food, which I do."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is typical. The restaurant was very noisy. The salsa and hot sauce was good. The cheese crisp was not crispy. The spinach enchilada was made with frozen or over cooked spinach. I was expecting fresh. The macha taco enchilada was filled with lots of meat. Just another ordinary bad Mexican restaurant. The waiter was very friendly and attentive though."}
{"text":"The menudo is very good. Great corn flavor not masked in Salt, highly recommend.  Husband had tacos, he wanted deep fried but carne Asada only comes in soft shell, his fault, he didn't ask. Salsa is really lame, Chunky but no taste, certainly no heat. The \"hot\" was just tomato sauce with Chile powder and salt-not a fan of either so I didn't bother with those. Still looking for a Mexican Restaurant with amazing, hot, Chunky salsa. Four stars for a great, attentive, hard working staff, nice feel to the restaurant too. Perhaps they can offer a version of salsa with Serrano and jalapeños!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by some locals. It's a clean establishment with fun decor. Parking out front was tight. Possible parking in the rear. Brought chips and salsa as soon as we sat down. Salsa was very tasty and chips were fresh. Their chili con queso  was very good, thick enough to stay on your chip. Ordered margaritas which were excellent. Peach was the favorite. Entrees-beef fajitas, chicken piccado and chicken tortilla soup were marginal. Could have used more seasoning/sauce on the meats, but sides were good. Loved the rice. I would go back for chips, salsa and the cheese sauce, and of course the margaritas. Also, service is was very good and servers were extremely nice."}
{"text":"Just wow. Were from Ohio and wanted to try some local Phoenix Mexican food while we were out, and after searching online we decided on Popos. Like other reviews said, don't be fooled by the exterior of the building, because the inside is like a hidden treasure. Great friendly and welcoming service and the food was to die for. Might not be able to eat Ohio \"Mexican\" food again after tasting this. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"If  you    are   afraid  to  drive  through  Maryvale  , you are  missing out.     Food is  delicious place  is a little  noisy, but people are  having fun.   Kid friendly,  really well made  drinks and  super Tuesday  99 cent margeritas.  Parking is   a bit tight so  bring a  small car.  Try it out"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa!!!!!! I'll take it. I'll have it all day long. Breakfast lunch and dinner. I'm all in. :D their chips are so fresh, hot and crunchy. Never stale!! It's just amazing. Literally!   I got the vegetarian chimichanga with rice on the side. Inside my chimichanga has yellow squash, bell peppers and onions. I eat half of the veggie chimichanga, boom I'm full. For a large plate like that is inexpensive yet filling and satisfying.   I'm always back!"}
{"text":"The food was not good at all I had the nachos I had the soup de Albóndigas it wasn't even a soup it was just 3 meatballs horrible experience I will never go back..."}
{"text":"Recommended by teaching colleagues from a school nearby. They know their salsa. I've been knocking around the SW and Mejico for some 50 years looking for el taco ultimo. Popo definitely enters the conversation. They close the conversation on the best tostada. The reason: great frijoles, fresh produce and that great salsa. Of course you know to augment the tostada with shovels of chips and salsa. Si, Si."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for lunch while in town. I had the steak fajitas, which I thought were really tasty. I ordered the 1/2 pound, which came out on a skillet with rice, guacamole, pico, sour cream and lettuce on the side. The order is enough for two peopleTo go with my order, I had the frozen sangria margarita. I normally don't like margaritas because I don't like tequila but this was so refreshing. You can definitely taste the sangria with just the right amount of tequila added.   The prices were really cheap. From the outside, you'd think this is a fast food type of restaurant, but the inside was totally different. It was decorated in Mexican decor and the place was packed.   The only thing we didn't like was that the service wasn't all that great. The first waiter that greeted us took forever with our drinks and the second waiter who took our food order barely checked on us."}
{"text":"Ordered a chimichanga with jalapeño cream cheese on 7-18-2015. It was disappointing, the cream cheese was so salty and the shredded beef was also a little bit salty. Told the waitress but asked me if I wanted a sour cream instead. It seems to me that they don't even care."}
{"text":"Great service ! Love this location ! From Cali this tops my place in Cali I recommends this place to everyone are served was kaylin best server ever!!"}
{"text":"I got the Red Chili lunch special yesterday and it was solid as always. I couldn't finish it so I brought it home. Heated it up tonight in the stove and it was one of the best meals I've ever had. I need to go there full and reheat more often.   Nice staff, clean enough, good service, reasonable prices, huge servings, second best chips and salsa in Phoenix.   Crappy section of town in a hole in the wall strip mall. Right where one would normally find top notch Mexican food."}
{"text":"My first and only time coming here was last night for a work party. I had an Italian margarita which was fantastic and the food was great too! The ambiance was similar to your typical mom and pop style restaurant and the service was phenomenal. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food hands down.  I love Popo's so much I literally crave it once a week.  The portions are so huge that you can eat Popo's twice in a row.  I have had pretty much everything on their menu with the exception of their salads and fajitas.  My favorite is a toss up between the pollo especial and the shredded beef tacos.  The Spanish rice is the BEST I have EVER had....don't tell my Nana I said that!  The customer service is outstanding.  I don't know of any Mexican food restaurant that can top Popo's.  The only negative is that it is ALWAYS packed!"}
{"text":"When someone mentions Mexican for lunch, I just figure it's gonna be another 'berto's, but not this time! Popo's is NOT easy to find and I almost drove right by it. It's in a little strip mall on the north side of Indian School. I didn't realize there was parking in back, but there are a few in front and I was lucky enough to find one.  We got a HUGE booth! The whole place is pretty spacious and the seating is super comfy. I always ask for a booth. I don't know why, but I love a booth. I had a combo of a chili relleno, enchilada and rice and beans. Everything was fresh, if a little greasy. There was a puddle of grease under my rice, but I didn't care much because I was eating Mexican food. We got chips and salsa right as we were seated. Service was quick during out entire meal. We ended up staying after our server left (it was one of those lunch meetings with 4 people who like to talk a LOT and we had to get our tab and pay so our server could leave) and nobody gave us any hassle for staying a couple hours. I really liked the bathrooms! Super clean, without that damn southwest decor. I reallllllllly hate kokopellis and cacti and whatever else makes up the southwest theme. Hate. Blech! The prices were a couple dollars higher than what you'd normally see, but it was fine since the quality of food was really good.  Oh, and I was speaking Spanish to the hostess but apparently she didn't speak it. Whoopsie!"}
{"text":"The absolute BEST Mexican food in Phoenix! Every time I fly in, I make certain that my arrival time coincides with  Popos OPEN for business hours and when my family picks me up, we head straight to POPOS on Indian School Rd from SKY HARBOR AIRPORT! The finest machaca beef I've ever eaten! I dream of it back here in Ohio, my local Mexican restaurant doesn't know what machaca beef is...Oy!! There's sometimes a bit of a wait (the sign of fabulous food) but the prices are moderate and the portions are generous! I can't wait to come back, AND I WILL BE BACK YUMMMM"}
{"text":"I don't ever post a bad review on any restaurant but today I was not satisfied with customer service. The food is great but as customer when you are told about a deal than it should be honored. So as we begin to order our drinks, the server told us that we get the special Margarita for 1.99. So my wife and I said ok we take that instead of regular drink we would order. Now the waitress see the drink, now we only order one meal to east tell us we can't have the drink for 1.99 b/c you have to have separate order to get the deal. We told her we wasn't told that when the server suggested the deal. She well me get my manager, so manager told us as house rule you must order two meals that it basically. As customer l feel if someone gave you the wrong information about something than they honor what that person told the customer. I will not be coming back for bad customer service"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican in Glendale/Phoenix area. This is our go to place for eating and catering. Salsa is amazing. My husband strongly recommends the Carne asada chimichanga enchilada style. I love the fajitas and carne asada burrito."}
{"text":"This one is easy...PoPo's is the real deal, straight up.  It's been a institution for 46 years; I first ate there back in 1980.  This is classic, Nana's style Sonoran food.  I noticed that there are some reviewers here that rave about it but only rate it at 3 stars...por que?    Heed not any naysayers. You don't stay in business for half a century making bad Mexican food in a town saturated with Mexican restaurants.   It requires no further explanation; no \"this was good but that was bland.\" \"It's a shady part of town.\" \"Parking is wack!\".  It's a given that it's in Maryvale, the lot is small and in 46 years some individual dishes here and there are bound to be misses.  Just go there, order what looks good and you'll see for yourself why this place keeps packing them in year after year."}
{"text":"I really want to do like 3.6 stars but that's not an option. I've been here a few times because my coworkers like it. It's \"pretty good\" Mexican food but I wouldn't say too much more than that. I don't recommend getting the carne asada burrito or any other burrito actually. Those are pretty average and you'd be better going to Filiberto's. Their authentic dishes, however, can be really good and I must say the chips and salsa are good as well. Overall it's a decent little spot but don't go there for burritos or chimichangas."}
{"text":"Probably one of the top five family Mexican restaurants in the Valley.  I can't get past their enchiladas to try anything else on the menu.  The ground beef is perfectly seasoned and each side with them has its own unique flavor which can be discerned in your mouth.  The portions are large for the price paid.  Service is excellent.  I recommend asking for Mauricio.  He's funny but professional and very accommodating.  This location is on my \"A\" list for sure and I highly recommend it for your dining pleasure as well."}
{"text":"Well it was nice while it lasted. This location had .99 Margaritas now 1.99 IF you meet their requirements. Each person has to order $8 or more NOT on average. Which is absurd when you order to share and it comes out to well over $8 average per person. Their new business model is driving loyal customers away like myself that has been coming here for years. You can definitely see the difference since they changed the requirements. We went in Saturday during dinner time and we didn't have to wait at all. We would normally wait thirty minutes. Hopefully the \"uppers\" see that their greed is really pissing people off. It's not about the money it's about principle. Also their margaritas are so weak now!"}
{"text":"One of my top 3 Authentic Mexican food restaurants in Phoenix Food never disappoints, everything taste so good. Best chips and salsa in town. I hardly recommend this place if  you like Authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about this restaurant from \"locals\" but tonight was my first time there. The place was packed and we waited 25 minutes for a table. IT WAS WELL WORTH IT! The service was outstanding with friendly, attentive servers. The food was excellent and moderately priced. Don't be dissuaded by the fact that it is in a little strip mall with odd shops around it. The inside is a family atmosphere and the food is superb!"}
