{"text":"Really liked this place.  Eclectic menu, with choices for everyone.  Mini donuts were awesome...coated with sugar, but the dough was not too sweet.  Reminiscent of a beignet.  Staff is super friendly!  Only complaint...  No stouts except Guiness..."}
{"text":"The fish tacos were amazing! probably the best in the city.  Also, our server Jazmyn was really friendly and provided great service. overall had a fabulous experience!"}
{"text":"Ambiance 4/5, big space with nice lighting and even some limited open window seating.  Service 3/5, the kitchen is downstairs so the servers get a work out carrying trays. Wasn't a particularly busy night but our mains felt slow. Front of house staff didn't seem the friendliest.   Food 2.5/5, We ordered KFC cauliflower, Nacho tots, fish tacos, yakisoba, steak frites. KFC was a recommendation but it was soggy and flavours were off. Nacho tots and steak were table favourites. If ordering the Yakisoba my recommendation is to stay at home and cook your own ramen and stir fry with veg. Drinks were okay too. Dessert menu is lacking with only two options.    Overall Paper St had us walking away agreeing it was sub par food that didn't live up to its standards of a restaurant with good fusion offerings. Price is very affordable, menu items we chose ranged from $4 taco special to $11 appies to 22 for steak frites.   Would maybe come back again to try the chicken in a waffle cone and taco specials but definitely for that Reese's pieces blondie in a jar!!"}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent but the $12.00 gin cocktail (although very tasty) is a little over priced."}
{"text":"It's quite loud, we were in the back and still had difficulty talking, so something to take into consideration if that bothers you. Our server was very friendly. She seemed new, as she forgot some items a couple times, but no big deal. She took care of it quickly.  We came to try out the ramen burger, but I figured I'd pick something different than my other 3 friends just to switch it up. I decided to get the Cuban sandwich with the tater tots. The sandwich was enjoyable, and the tater tots were delicious, but the sandwich is a bit pricey at $14. The ramen burger, however, is basically a meat patty sandwiched between flavourless buns. Cool idea, but the ramen just don't do well on the burger. It has zero flavour. The meat itself was quite tasty.  Overall, just a tad pricey for what you get, and the ramen burger was a let down. I would have given this 4 stars, but one of the servers walked out of the washroom without even attempting to wash her hands. Pretty disgusting for a food establishment."}
{"text":"Delicious food ! Great drinks and nice casual ambience. I definitely recommend paper st if you're looking for comfort food and a great atmosphere to socialize. Huge washrooms and open airy concept make for a great place to get together. The cubano, nachotots, mexicorn salad and fiery Mac and Cheese were all huge hits for our group  we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The perfect after work bar for Calgary in this moment. Bright, bare and lively-loud with a mix of draft and semi-craft cocktails, and decently priced, really well made low brow street food. The menu stretches across the globe for tasty casual dishes without seeming forced. I wanted everything on the menu, but picked the na-cho-tots and Reese's blonde sundae. The tater tots were crispy, topped with a vibrant and spicy mix of fresh jalapeños, tasty guacamole with a heavy cumin accent, sour cream and assorted veg confetti. It'd be easy to make this dish bland with pickled jalapeños or having soggy tots or a packaged guac, but they really put the effort in. The blondie was warm and peanut buttery, with a good quality ice cream and a generous amount of chocolate fudge sauce, a good deal for $5. Will definitely be back to try all the other offerings I saw going by, like the Nashville sandwich or the jerk chicken!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. Service was fast and we were in and out in under an hour. Menu is unique, I had the waffle and chicken as well as the fish taco for lunch, two of their appetizers. Price was $5 each. The waffle and chicken wasn't what I was expecting. It was a waffle cone with a chicken strip, mashed potatoes and slaw inside. Made it hard to eat without deconstructing it. The fish taco was delish. Would definitely go back to try some of their other items but found that most of their menu had spicy dishes or weren't lactose intolerant friendly."}
{"text":"Disgusting food ever i wont come back  they cant make the proper sandwich sauce taste really bad and the salad taste shit who ever is the chef is trying hard not very good chef inwont recomend this restaurant. The backwards night club was really good sandwich the best specialy cubano amd crispy pork samdwich this is the reall chef . Paper street no thank you i bring my co worker husky building wven the ceo of husky not very impressed the food taste shit"}
{"text":"Got orders wrong, missed orders, salad had rotting blueberries in it. Also awful vegetarian selection. One burger that falls apart."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and great service at a good price. Especially appreciated the friendly, attentive service in a very busy restaurant. Maybe make that 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Had a group come in and the waitress was really rude and seemed irritated to serve us. Food came out fast and was alright but service wasn't great"}
{"text":"I was expecting this place to live up to the hype, but was disappointed. I ordered their cubano sandwich, which looks amazing on their webpage, and got a sad, thin, dry boring sandwich. It tasted like cardboard and looked like it was made last week. Very little sauce, a thin slice of ham and barely any pork. The fries were decent. My friend ordered the kale salad with grilled prawns and said it was delicious."}
{"text":"Never underestimate the power of social media because that's exactly what lured me here. And it's the amazing food that's going to keep me coming back!  I love love love fried chicken. Seeing their take on chicken & waffles - buttermilk chicken strips and mashed potatoes stuffed in a waffle cone, I knew it was a must have!  Their na-cho-tots? Tater tots smothered in creamy queso, spicy sour cream, guac and jalapeños? Sooooooo good!  And you cannot go wrong with their mac & cheese. Bacon? Yes. Dorito crust? Did they make mac & cheese even BETTER by crumbling cheesy nacho chips on top? YOU KNOW IT!  I seriously want to continue coming back till I've tried everything on their menu - it's that good!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place for lunch or drinks. Service is quick, food is delicious and they have a decent selection of drinks. The chicken waffle cone is not to be missed. So delicious. Have been here a couple of times now, once with a large group and service was great each time."}
{"text":"Loud, dark and unfriendly atmosphere. Got the ramen burger and it was like eating un seasoned ground beef and plain noodles as a sandwich, did not at all live up to the hype that Instagram led me onto.  Also used the washroom at the same time as a waitress that I noticed from the restaurant, fully witnessed her leave the stall and not wash her hands before returning to the floor. Quite gross."}
{"text":"Delicious. If you want great portions and options...this place rules. Big space. Lots of seating. The service was good. The food was better."}
{"text":"Paper St is a new bar/restaurant, conveniently located across from the Globe Cinema so it would be perfect for dinner and a movie! I will be planning that soon. I had the opportunity to sample several Paper St offerings this evening and they were all good, but the stand out was the Cauliflower Taco - Uber YUMMY!!!   I am familar with the beauty of baked cauliflower but amping it up in an amazing taco? WOW! :-)  You did good Paper St! :-) Vegetarians and meat eaters alike, this is a must try! If a veggie taco doesn't suit, then you will be more then fine with their many other delicious offerings - creative but not pretentious! They put quality first. If you are burned out on silly pretentious hipster food then this place will restore faith that yes! Calgary can.. do good street-style food. The servers were friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. I was lucky enough to chat with the Sous Chef Alex - what a sweetheart, his heart and integrity shine through! :-)"}
{"text":"It was noon on a Thursday and super busy.   Service was slow as our waitress was overworked.  The chicken bowl I got was good and the ramen burger my friend got was not that good.   He won't be ordering it again.  4 stars for my food but the service dropped it a star for me."}
{"text":"Normally I would give only two out of five stars because the food was very disappointing, I just had the tater tot's which were supposed to be spicy but to pay $16 for probably just store bought previously frozen shredded and deep fried potato is pretty crazy, that is a huge mark up because everyone knows how cheap potatoes are. Plus I had extremely upset stomach for the rest of the day, and that was only thing that I ate so that was too bad. However the waitress was pleasant so she could have been more talkative, plus I don't know if they always have happy hour but last night they had happy hour so wine was only five dollars!, plus I gave extra points because it was exactly the location, right place and right time for me. Nice high ceilings, interesting decor and lighting and music, plus the music was playing at just the right volume. Plus my favorite thing were these huge open windows, I'm from Toronto where you need screens everywhere because the bugs are so bad but here if you don't seem to have hornets or houseflies anywhere or mosquitoes, you might as well open up the walls like this and let in the sunshine and fresh air!It was a beautiful perfect temperature day and at 5 PM the perfect time for people watching so I had quite a lot of fun. Thank you very much."}
{"text":"This is a very casual pub/restaurant in downtown Calgary. The food was decent and a good value. I enjoyed the chicken in a waffle with coleslaw and mashed potato inside. The poke-Cho's were really yummy. I appreciated the nonalcoholic beverage choices as well. Grizzly Paw ginger beer on tap is an excellent choice. The service was really good too."}
{"text":"Went for lunch during a weekday. Was busy but both the food and the service was good."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night at 6pm with a bunch of girlfriends. Was able to make reservations online but it ended up being pretty dead when we got there for 6pm. Service was good and attentive and waitress was able have individual bills for the 7 of us which was convenient. I got the ramen burger and thought it was ok. The ramen \"buns\" could have been crispier and seasoned more. It was a bit bland. Good thing the mushroom, eggs and kimchi slaw on top of the patty made up for it."}
{"text":"I definitely expected more of this place. This is nothing more than a bar with sub-par food. It is alright for drinks, but I would not come for food again."}
{"text":"Absurdly incompetent service and terrible food. My wife asked for a virgin cocktail and the waitress brought her a Shirley temple. I guess they technically brought what she asked for, but seriously guys? Do we look ten years old? My coffee was lukewarm and left on my table without an offer of cream or sugar or even the opportunity to ask for it. We also had no cutlery. So even though the place was quiet we had slow service that missed some of the most basic serving requirements.   Our appetizers were slathered in mayonnaise-based sauces and were otherwise not tasty so we didn't order entrees. No idea how this place has four stars, the other local options must be pretty dire."}
{"text":"We strolled inside over the lunch hour as the place was packed so assumed it must be good! Unfortunately the complete opposite was true, we were a party of 3 so experienced a good cross section of the menu. We had The Cuban Sandwich, Tuna Tacos and the Vietnamese Bowl, all had too much sauce, poor presentation and overall lacked flavour. The service was appalling, the waitress was rude and took the up sell a little too far. The space is nice and unfortunately that is the only reason I would give this place two stars."}
{"text":"I've been to Paper St. on two occasions now and admittedly I am less enthused about the experience the second time around. On my first foray into Paper St. I tried the elotes which is corn served with chipotle feta cheese and poblano mayo. Don't let the peppers fool you, it is not a spicy dish but it is creamy and delicious. I followed that up with the ramen burger which was delicious (very buttery) but if not eaten fast enough the noodles will come apart.  I popped back in yesterday to have more elotes, and decided to try their soup of the day which was a Manhattan chowder. The chowder was good, and it was served in a creamy tomato broth as opposed to the usual white broth you get with New England chowder. As delicious as it was, the broth was runny and could hardly be called a chowder. It was a good soup, but definitely not chowder. I then moved on to the yakisoba and was so underwhelmed with the entire dish. The noodles were unctuous as ramen noodles should be, but the whole flavor profile was bland. A little acid to brighten up the dish would not have hurt or maybe some ginger to brigthen up, I don't know. All I can say is that was not a dish I would come back and have again.  The crowd the second time around was the corporate after work crowd, and they had the Jays game on which I am always up for watching. The service was somewhat friendly, but not welcoming. Overall a decen eatery that I would again come back to, if only to order the elotes and have a beer."}
{"text":"I ate here The food was good it made this fat man happy It was a little to busy when I went on a thursday evening for my likings, but im a crotchety old man so there that. I was just hoping it would be a bit quieter is all"}
{"text":"I don't know why this location feels off the beaten path but it's worth the trip and hassle to park.  Menu is a mind f%#k because you can't choose but from our tables' choices, nobody went wrong. Cocktails are classic and dependable. Love that.  I had the smothered burrito picking it by closing my eyes and pointing.  It was so yummy. Felt very comfort food, and like it was going to be way too much but I had to keep going in for one more bite. My tease of the Cubano has me wanting to sneak back right now.  The waffles cone was so cool and smelled Delish.  Tater tots-nuff said.    I would lend my 2 cents and say that the sports bar/restaurant/club feel is confusing. Maybe if it was busier it might all work.  But it was a Saturday night and very quiet thus why I'm hoping to help out and tell people to go for the food!  And they do half price wine.  Yeah they do. Prices are excellent.  Desert was perfect and at $5...why not.    Service was kind but needs a bit of training to keep up with the food.  Not great on knowing the menu or attention, even paying the bill was awkward but heart is in right place.  Train up the staff and that would go a long way."}
{"text":"The intersection for a world of street food. Paper St. (It's yours. Take it. You're welcome.)  Don Draper and Mel Gibson in \"What Women Want\" would have lost their minds over that gold I just dropped. Paper St. is a collection of street food inspired dishes from around the world. To paraphrase their words: \"Not exactly traditional, nor fusion\" - Paper St. gives everything from poutine, to Yakisoba, to rotisserie jerk chicken their own unique, fun loving twist.   While the food inspiration leans toward a world of grab'n'go, Paper St. is a place to chill out for a while with friends. They're set up restaurant style with a front host and table service, so by all means a restaurant, but with a relaxed, come as you are vibe and a refined edge that's trendy and uniquely Calgarian.  I went with the Nashville Chicken Sandwich and it's inspired me to come back and try everything on the menu. It's a local farm buttermilk fried chicken breast, provolone, pickled carrots and cucumber, cilantro and mayo, (making a coleslaw type topping.) All of this is soaked in a house made hot sauce. Think of a tastier, homemade version of Frank's red hot. You're gonna want to put this $#!+ on everything!  If you're here for social reasons over eatin' reasons, they've got an impressive selection of $5ish snackin' options including a chicken and waffle cone, house cooke chips and dip and more.   The open window street side bars along the west facing front are ideal for catching some sunshine and doing some people watching. As far as indoor seating goes, this is pretty close to a patio.  I didn't get to check out the drink selection this visit, but after today's visit, I'm eager for my chance!"}
{"text":"Happen to find this place randomly on social media and decided to give it a try. It has a nice casual ambience and bigger than your average hipster bar. The music is good too. Our server Chanelle was great, attentive and upbeat. Drinks are decently priced, they have a good selection of draft and wines.  Now on to the food. SO GOOD. Right from portion sizes to flavors to price. I had the Smothered Burrito ($16) and my friend had the Beef Kebabs ($17). The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because they were sold out of the Rotisserie Jerk Chicken and they did not have the Sirloin steak for the steak and frites both of which we tried to order before we settled on something else.  This place is worth checking out regardless."}
{"text":"Perfect ! Very chilled place , food was awesome. Would definitely recommend and come back. The menu was quite different as well"}
{"text":"I was really glad with the service they provided us for NYE night. Decoration is simple but has antique feeling.We were 11 people all together and they went above and beyond with their services. Food was really nice and different. Tried their special from the menu, Lamb Shank with ginger and tamarind. Everyone in our table enjoyed their food. At midnight they also provided all their customers with free drink to celebrate."}
{"text":"Thank-you for hosting us Elite Yelper's, Paper Street!  We had a great time, and are already planning our next trip back!  Paper St. has a great craft beer selection.  I would like to add a wish list request for another Radler - Tree Brewing or Stiegel are my personal faves.  We sampled a number of appetizers and our event was topped off with mini donuts.  Could anything other than mini donuts make a food experience more complete???  Our favourite appetizer BY FAR was the bratwurst sliders in their delicious little pretzel buns.  We can't wait to go back and try some more!  They also make an interesting slider/burger where the bun is ramen noodles - I personally wasn't a fan (needed a tad more seasoning) - but I commend them for bringing some originality to pub food back to downtown Calgary!  Can't wait to see you soon Paper St! :)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating here. I had the hummus and my sister had the black bean burger. The tater tots were so good they were fried perfectly, crispy and not oily! The black bean burger was ok, wish it was seasoned better, it tasted really plain. I had the hummus plate. I thought it came with falafel but I guess I was mistaken. I wish I was here on a Tuesday for their Pac & Guac special! I only took 1 star away because I came in at 3:30pm and they already ran out of carnitas when I ordered a carnitas taco and I also tried to order the cheesecake on the stick and they were out of that too."}
{"text":"Except for the service, this was an exceptional meal. We had a chicken and waffle cone, the burger with a side of nacho tots, a ramen burger with shoestring fries, and a couple beers. Everything tasted great. Well, we did spend 10 minutes scraping the mayo sauce off my husband's burger, since either the waitress forgot to tell the kitchen or the kitchen forgot. Waitress never seemed to notice...didn't even register when she picked up the pile of scraped-off-mess on the side of the tray. She spent 30+ minutes sitting and chatting with the young guys behind us (yes, that was literally the time, since I could gauge by the time left in the soccer game on tv). Had to ask a couple times for a box and then flag her down for the check. I mean, she was a super sweet girl. Friendly...probably preferred spending time with the tables of young guys. Just maybe needs some more training, and she'd be a great waitress."}
{"text":"came in for chicken and waffles.  was great.  great flavours.  but 6 bux for a tiny bit of chicken and potatoe...ripoff.   everything was premade and they just heat it up for you.  i should be thankful that its not cold chicken and cold potatoes...  the amazing perfect 10 waitresss are what sell this place (boobs) and the letch of a manager/owner."}
{"text":"I have been here five times and will say consistency is an issue. I've been at lunch a few times and been super impressed with service and quality of the food. I would definitely recommend the nacho tots (soooooo cheesy). At dinner, it has been a hit or miss, last time I went, that was a miss. Service wasn't bad but food was pretty bland, had the jerk chicken and it wasn't flavorful and the salad was really overdressed."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food.  It is rather noisy but that has been the same with every restaurant that has been in this location.  For me it is not an oh my word have to eat here, like some of the other places I have been too, but still a decent place to eat at."}
{"text":"WOW this place is pretty trendy. It offers trendy food. Things that are out of the ordinary.Dined here for the first time at lunch time today and have nothing but great things to say about the whole experience.The meal/dishes here  was delicious and tasty"}
{"text":"Great food and cool room.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffle cone was delicious--the highlight of my dinner. However the chicken and vegetable soup was a bit too salty but very creamy and otherwise tasty. The tacos were also too salty and not very delicate. The salad that came with the burger was surprisingly good for someone who hates salads. That was probably the best salad I've ever had. The portions were good though for the price. The waitress was very nice and friendly and got all of our orders correct. Service was very quick--we got our food in no time. Ambience was quite nice, a little bit dimmed. The music was a little too loud for me but it's not a big deal. Make sure to try the chicken and waffle cone if you're adventurous!!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday evening, there were a few tables of patrons, but could easily find a table.    I had thought it would be a bit more upscale based on the menu, but the place felt more like a sports bar than it did a restaurant.    We were told to seat ourselves anywhere.  We were provided menus and our server came back after a few mins to take drink orders.  Ordered a beer and when it came to the table it was good and cold (just the way I like it).  Ordered food and decided to go with the smothered burrito.  Upon getting it, I was surprised that it was covered in bolognese sauce.  Not quite what I would have expected for a burrito.  But thought, hey why not, give it a try.  Unfortunately this is not a combination flavour profile that works that well together.  The rice and beans, along with the small amounts of shredded pork inside the burrito clash with the bolognese sauce.  There were taco chips on the side of plate and when I tried these... they were definitely stale (blech), thankfully, there was more than enough food with the burrito.    Overall, the service was very good and the place was clean.  The meal was ok, but I'm not a fan of the combination, maybe try something else.  I think I expected Paper St to be a bit more upscale.  But that's ok, it looks like it could be a fun place to hang and have drinks.  I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and am a fan despite the service. Group of 5 enjoyed drinks, appies then dinner in the trendy atmosphere. Diverse menu, prices average for downtown. Generous portion sizes when paired with an appetizer. Nashville Hot Sandy - one of the most delicious chicken sandwiches I've ever had in my life! Don't miss the nacho-tater tots - it's worth having the full order on its own, not just the upgrade-charge-side dish. Our veggie friend was more than happy with the Veggie Smalls burger and a range of veggie options available. The cubano was a sad last-place finish among the orders, served as a hoagie style panini that was neither hot nor cold..   Back to the service - we dined early for supper, before peak hour on a Saturday. We informed the waitress of our intention to have a few drinks before ordering food, and yet our glasses stayed empty sometimes for 15 minutes before she came back to check on us. Once we did order, food came up quick. Paralyzers were the drink of choice - however we had to send back a few as they were curdled when brought to the table. As the third and final paralyzer began to separate, she rolled her eyes when asked for a new one. THAT was the final straw. When the waitress finally noticed our dissatisfaction with her lack of tip, she was so brazen as to ask why we hadn't tipped her well. She then rolled her eyes when told it was because of her eye rolling attitude earlier! OMG - LOL.   Would happily return for the food and atmosphere - would just seek out a server with less 'tude."}
{"text":"Ate here an hour and half before closing and the place was fairly busy for a Wednesday night. Service was good although the fellow who brought the dinner (not my server) did not even look at me and just plunked the food on the table and left, even though I asked a question. I guess he's not paid to interact. My own server was very good and she was attentive and helpful with the menu choice I made.  I had the Burrito and it was really good. Way too much for me to handle on my own so I took half back to my hotel. It was $5 Keith's night and they have a different drink special each night.  Atmosphere was good and appeals to a young adult crowd probably more than my age (62) All the games were on the big screens and one could watch the Olympics, football or baseball (Jays beat Rays 7-0 Yah)"}
{"text":"Visited here a few times for lunches after they opened, it was a short walk from the option and I love the concept of all the different street food items. I was very impressed on my first visit, it was so hard to pick what I wanted to try and everything coming out of the kitchen looked really good. Seemed really popular with the downtown lunch crowd as the place was packed on all my visits. They have great big open windows at the front but they can open without glass which makes it a bit breezy in the early spring days and I was a little chilly. They have really good tacos and salads, the menu works really well for sharing if you want to sample a few different things. We also tried the tots and they were a good little appetizer, the chips and dill dip were also really popular. Can't speak to the drink menu as I was at work so it was just water for me."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good vegan black bean burger that two two hands to eat and then I needed two napkins to clean up my delicate phalanges- a sure sign of an amazing meal."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Decided to have lunch with a few friends at Paper St as it was right next to my hotel. Good thing we got in before noon, because this place got incredibly busy very fast. Noticed a lot of table reservations as well.  Paper St mainly focuses on tacos and burgers, but they have a large diversity of Pan-Asian products, such as KFC (Korean Fried Chicken), laksa, and ramen burger. There's also a large drink selection, although I didn't end up drowning myself in alcohol this early in the day.  I had the laksa, since the server mentioned it was one of the newer items and I wanted to see the non-Asian twist to it. The portion size was very large and the current coconut broth taste was indeed very strong. However the noodles were way overcooked...it broke apart with absolutely zero effort at all, which made eating them really hard. Unfortunately I would go with a different dish next time.  Service was very good, everyone inside was very friendly and were accommodating of us tourists."}
{"text":"My new favourite spot in Calgary. I ordered so many items because everything sounds amazing, I couldn't choose, and I was not disappointed. I love the veggie/vegan options. I would describe this as gourmet junk food. 5 stars for sure. UPDATED REVIEW: Ate in the restaurant today and received really poor service. So busy in there though, they must be understaffed. Will only order in now."}
{"text":"WOW this place is pretty trendy. It offers trendy food. Things that are out of the ordinary. Like Ramen Burger and the Chicken and Waffle Cone.   So came here during lunch time. Wished I bought my business card or else I could have enter in the weekly draw. Anyways so we were lucky to get a seat even though we came after noon. Place is a bit noisy and yes it was very busy. They have drinks special through out the week. But because its a work day, we can't drink. I loved the décor. It has green on the wall, and artsy drawing etc.  Service was nice. We were left along but this is a pub style place. So I did notice the waitress looked our way couple times. That is good.   So I ordered the Chicken and Waffle Cone and the fish taco. I loved the Chicken and Waffle Cone. For $6, its totally worth it. Its actually quite big eventhough it was listed as tidbit size. It had mash potatoes inside. Just the right combination. Also of course a hint of syrup was just perfect. I loved the crunchiness of the cone. They must make the cone in house. It was warm when I got it. The Fish taco was not bad. Fish was very crunchy and didn't fall apart easily after several bites. SO... You can still eat the taco very femininely (what I call it) with etiquette.   Loved the fall and highly recommend coming here for a try.   Note they have some other cool things here like Ramen Burger etc."}
{"text":"This review is based on preference.  The food was simply too much for early in the afternoon.  It is incredibly filling and not very satisfying.  I couldn't eat a third of the M+C waffle cone and that is because I'm a 190 pound male.  I give it three stars because I'm sure a lot of people would love the very  filling aspect of it."}
{"text":"Great food!  You will not be disappointed!  Drinks are good and atmosphere is pleasant.  Loving the music but can still converse with your table. Staff is friendly and on top of everything, Rebecca is a great host and helps make the atmosphere warm and friendly..  You will be missing out if you don't stop by this place for some great food, drinks and staff.  Thanks for our last Canada meal before we head back to the hot Arizona."}
{"text":"Friday night at 9pm. No need to wait to be seated so we took a booth. We tried the spicy chicken slider, a fish taco and a chicken with mash in a waffle cone. I was a big fan of the fish taco but hubby liked the waffle cone. I personally didn't love the mash mixed with the cone's sweetness.  Next up, hubby had a burger with shoe string fries.  I had a ramen burger. The  meat patties tasted great!  I found the ramen to be a lot so took the top half of my ramen bun off and only ate the bottom layer. The tater tots were crispy and not at all greasy. The atmosphere is pub like and comfortable and not overly loud but loud enough that I had to lean in closer to talk across the table.  My only complaint is that my burger had cheese when I had asked it be removed twice- once when I ordered and again when our server returned with our drinks to confirm our order. Our waitress was extremely friendly and apologized profusely saying it was her fault and she could send it back. I was hungry so took a lactaid pill and moved on.  Overall, this would be a great lunch place and has a relaxing  but \"get together with friends watering hole\" vibe.  I will definitely be back again if I'm in the area to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"I liked my first experience here. It was important for me to sample the food so I know what I like! To be honest looking at the menu before I came, I would never have given this spot a second thought. Thank you Dale and Yelp putting this together because now I know I like food and drink outside my comfort zone!!  Again I will reiterate I hate gin, but the suggestion Shyanna made of the Bramble cocktail, because I like a sweeter cocktail was great! Loved the drink!! Sampled some beer too!  My favourite food sample was the pork carnitas taco loved it!! Also loved the house cooked chips and dip, and the elotes the ramen burger was good too! Drinks are pricey but I will be back! Enjoyed it very much!! I suggest go outside your box, you never know until you try it!!"}
{"text":"What a refreshing addition to the Calgary culinary scene. Five big fat stars for the following: atmosphere , service , drink specials , and of course food. While everyone at our table rave about their dishes I'm going to take this opportunity to suggest two - you absolutely have to order the KFC ( don't even ask just trust me) and the mac and cheese - it's topped with crumbled Doritos. Mmmhmmm !"}
{"text":"We came in early when is was empty and the staff was great and took some extra time to chat and suggest couple items.  Drinks where delicious and beer selection very impressive. The food was awesome with some unique items that impressed us.  Try the poke, huge fish tacos or fried chicken waffle and you will come back for more.  I would say this is a must stop for the foodie person."}
{"text":"This place has such a cool vibe to it. Literally! The big windows are open at the front giving a beautiful breeze that flows in. Great atmosphere. Stopped for a quick drink and appetizer. Tons of beers on tap for choice. The menu items are really neat. We tried the Mexican Corn On the cob....it was heavenly delicious. I would for sure go back. Our server was great too"}
{"text":"Came here Wednesday evening with a few friends for a last minute dinner before I head out back to Chicago. I heard such great things from other friends and yelp that we had to try this place out. Paper St offers street food from all over the world but the one thing I wanted to try from their menu was the ramen burger... unfortunately they were sold out AT 630pm??!!? I am guessing it was an extremely popular item or they just didn't make enough for the day. Instead I ordered the Nashville Spicy Burger along with a few other of my friends. We also ordered the Bacon Mac & Cheese and the Bahn Mi Sandwich.  Overall the food was mediocre and nothing special, but one common factor was that all of our fries had a mix of fresh out of the frier and some that have been sitting there getting soggy and unappetizing.   The ambiance was great and allowed the outdoor feeling without being outside especially during this \"rainy\" season and it allowed for great people watching. There was a good mix of table top and traditional seating.   Several different factor went into my review - mediocre food, great ambiance and great fusion/take on comfort foods from around the world. However, the biggest factor for my visit at Paper St was the service, it was extremely slow and the waitress was no where to be seen for most of the night. At one point in the night there was not a single employee to be seen, no bartender, no waitress, no hostess, nadaa! When we were trying to pay for the bill our waitress disappeared for 10 mins so we had to flag down the bartender to take our money... Maybe they were understaffed that night or had a off day but overall Paper St was a bust for me. I would be open to trying it out again in the future once they iron out the kinks. Happy Munching!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a light lunch and had their Dynasty Bowl. The food was good but not exceptional and the service was above average. Overall it is a good value for the price."}
{"text":"Good and unique food fusions. More of a chill environment for a younger crowd. Definitely a place to go to when you want to try something new/different."}
{"text":"We decided to celebrate my older brother's birthday at Paper St. as it was the long weekend in November and most places were closed(And their ramen burger caught our eye).  We ordered Korean chicken wings, chicken n' waffles(2 orders), and 2 soups to start. Then we ordered 2 butter chickens, 2 ramen burgers, po boy, and Mexican salad.   So we definitely tried out a ton of their food and we were very disappointed. The ramen burger definitely needed more seasoning(also it would have been nice if the noodles were not soggy) and the chicken n' waffles were just one cone with a bunch of coleslaw in it and a super small chicken piece(such a waste!). The rest of the food were bland, so we didn't finish any of our main orders.  The service was good, and all our food items came quickly. But overall not too impressed with the food, so probably not gonna come back to try the rest of their menu. Too bad we really wanted to love their ramen burger."}
{"text":"3.5/5 I came here on a Saturday night with a table of 7 and a reservation. We were seated immediately, but I can't speak much to the ambience since we were tucked away right by the bathrooms and separately from the rest of the restaurant.... the ambience in that corner was sterile and cold but I was with great company and a few bottles of wine so I didn't really care!  The server was friendly enough, but in my opinion missed a few steps of service that I think are critical. First, I was only asked how my meal was after I finished most of it - that is honestly one of the worst steps you can miss in my mind. Second, she did not inquire about billing till the end so she was not prepared and didn't separate the bills well. Lastly, nothing was replenished without asking.  I ordered the ramen burger ($18), expecting a Japanese twist.... this is not what I received.... now to be fair, the menu does not indicate a Japanese flare... this was my assumption because it was a ramen burger!!! The burger had a ramen bun.... like two ramen patties.... with pretty normal innards. The beef patty was juicy, and it came with mayo, fried egg, kimchi slaw, cheese and mushrooms. Now in a regular bun this may have been okay, but with oily ramen patties this burger was just too greasy and chronic. Perhaps a good choice AFTER my night of drinking LOL, but not a wise move for the beginning of the night. I would change this to open face so you only need one ramen pattie, add fresh veggies  (oh I don't know... let's say some lettuce perhaps!!!) and change the sauce to a wasabi aioli or nori mayo. Maybe add shiso leaf. I added nacho tots ($5) which were epic but a very greasy addition to my already greasy meal.  The tots came with sour cream, salsa, and guac... no additional sauce required :)  Needless to say, almost a bottle of wine did not get me anywhere with all the greasy food! I would consider coming back here and trying something else if someone wanted to...... but I wasn't overly impressed."}
{"text":"Food is really good. Personally like the chicken in a waffle. cheap and delicious. Server is nice and fast. Great deals too. Worth a try."}
{"text":"A menu inspired by street food from around the world? Um yes please! I remember seeing a photo of the chicken & waffle cone and I immediately was on the hunt for the place where this is a reality. It's not often when I scan over a menu and I am SO conflicted on what to get because everything just sounds so amazing and I get sad I don't have multiple stomachs.   First of all, I am enamoured by the awesome wall art of the Rat Pack on the left when you first enter, which was done by a local artist. It adds a bit of a classic flare to a hip place which I love. The place itself it pretty big with plenty of seating and a wide open window that makes it look even bigger and allows a lot of fresh air into the place, which is especially awesome on a nice day. The server we had was very friendly and down to earth. It happened to be half price wine that day, so of course we got a bottle. We had SUCH a hard time with the menu because there were so many creative and unique options (ramen burger!) that we eventually decided on getting a bunch of appies. I LOVED the chicken and waffle cone, and this is coming from someone who has yet to come across a good chicken and waffle combo. The buttermilk chicken was crisp and moist and just had the perfect amount of sweetness to it that it wasn't overpowering. The waffle cone itself was soft and not your standard crunchy, ice cream cone.   The salt and pepper turkey wings are gigantic, but super flavourful. The chipotle ranch is also equally amazing and I would drown all my food in it. My girlfriend is a huge taco fan and said that both the pork and fish tacos were delicious. The na-cho-tots were also great! With all the fixings on top, I found that you had to eat it fairly quickly as the tots can get soggy.   Overall, loved the place and it's atmosphere, will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Stopped in a quick bite - got the chicken and waffles and a Ramen Burger. Got the Tots to go with the burger - THE BEST! I could just get an order of tots and the sauce they come with. YUM!  Very friendly and fun place."}
{"text":"Ambiance  was too bare for me,and cold,mom's grilled cheese was a tiny serving and the chips were pretty bad,and was expensive for the serving size. I wont be back."}
{"text":"Just walked in here on a Tuesday night and glad I did. Great atmosphere and sports bar feel with screens over the bar and projection on one wall. Music was good and not too loud.  I just ordered \"the burger\" with bacon- honestly one of the best burgers I have had in a while. Great flavor. Server also convinced me to get the \"loaded tots\". Was not disappointed. Would definitely go here again."}
