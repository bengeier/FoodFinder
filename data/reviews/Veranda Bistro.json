{"text":"So much for the Starbuck's coffee at Veranda. As of this week they've replaced it with some wimpy Folger's-syle stuff. Humpf. I guess everybody is trying to cut costs in this economy, but they've just eliminated the main draw for me in the morning. because my office lunchroom coffee tastes better than their new stuff. Woe is me..."}
{"text":"It's better than nothing.   If you work in the area (16th and Morton) and have a limited amount of time for lunch, or if you didn't have time to eat breakfast in the morning the Veranda Bistro is for you. You will be completely not-excited-but-not-disappointed by this exactly as expected food.   The breakfast menu is essentially 4 ingredients (egg, meat, cheese, starch) served in several varieties. They all pretty much taste the same. One warning, the home fries are typically undercooked. The eggs have an amazing characteristic, that being the ability to crumble into a pile of bits too tiny to be picked up with a fork. I sense some breakfast fairy magic at play.   Lunchtime is a bit better, with several sandwich options, both cold and hot. There are salads and soup, and a variety of deep fried snacks. I've eaten a few of the cold sandwiches, and they are moderately tasty. The salads are premade and sitting in a cooler, which makes for some drippy lettuce.   Speaking of lettuce, I would love to meet the monster that's strong enough to cram THAT MUCH lettuce into one container. I'm not exaggerating when I say I pulled off enough lettuce to make two more salads of equal size. No one in this world needs that much lettuce in one sitting.   Veranda Bistro serves a valuable purpose and is blessed with a great location. It's the only restaurant within walking distance for a few thousand people. I only wish that they tried a little harder rather than delivering exactly what I expected. Curse my low expectations!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch. The food is good and the prices are also. I was pleasantly surprised by a salad of all things. It was a soup and salad combo that i ordered. The ingredients were fresh and i was able to choose what i wanted on it and the broccoli cheese soup was also very good. It is a nice convenient and quick little lunch spot."}
{"text":"Freshest best scrambled eggs I've had in years! Staff/owner very friendly and helpful with menu options. Very rare to see these days!"}
{"text":"Cute lil hole in the wall place that's great for a quick bite. They have a deli section where they always have hard boiled eggs, tuna, chicken, quinoa,  parfaits, or salads available for quick pickup or you can order off their menu.   They also have daily specials for lunch or breakfast, which despite it being a bit routine, are still decent when you're looking for a quick bite.  The service here is what gives it 4 stars, the sisters that manage the restaurant are amazing and are great about remembering your favorites."}
{"text":"I come here often and up until today I was pretty happy with my experience. Today however, I paid $6 for a burger patty. No fries, no bun - just a patty. When I brought it to the attention of the owner (who was cashing me out) she just offered a receipt. O.K - Her English is not that good so I figured she was hiding behind that. I will no longer be eating here since I can make five hamburgers with $6."}
{"text":"It's convenient.  I've been working in the area for over two years and they still have the same menu.   The best is the crossaint delight and the turkey wrap with added sprouts.  What they have is good, make no mistake.   Perhaps a website with announcements of their daily specials would be great."}
{"text":"Had a great bacon cheeseburger and ham and Swiss sandwich. Very fresh ingredients, great service and definitely big portions. Macaroni salad was tasty as a side. Always a plus when you get a dill pickle spear too."}
{"text":"\"The Bistro\" as we call it, is right next door to my office. I walk to work every day and this is my breakfast and coffee stop most mornings.   A bagel, English muffin, or a croissant with a breakfast meat of your choosing and some egg and even the dreaded cheese (we have got to stop putting cheese on everything, America) can be yours for about $3.50. And this is a big muffin/bagel.croissant, not a mini-Mickey D's sized meal.   I've had quite a few lunches here as well, and the Veranda Classic on ciabatta and the Chicken Soprano Panini are my #1 & #2 respectively. With fries and a drink, it's about $7.50. Asian Chicken Salad is pretty good, too.  Different menu items show up as a special now & then- one time it was General Tso's chicken with fried rice, a chorizo burrito another. Hot dogs have been spotted at The Bistro.  Everyone here is friendly and now that I'm a regular, Pam makes my coffee for me just as I like it and I don't even have to add my own cream and sugar anymore.   Only open til 3pm and only on weekdays."}
{"text":"I thought I had written a review already, but apparently not. I love Veranda!! The people there are incredibly nice and the variety is good! The food is ALWAYS fresh and high quality.   Usually I determine how much I like a resteraunt by not only how good the food is there, but the variety of foods. If you can order anything off the menu, and it's all made well, it's a good resteraunt. Veranda definately has this quality! I can choose a variety of foods (salad, soup, sandwiches, burritos, breakfast items) and know I'll be happy with the taste!!   My favorites are the croissant delight (club on croissant) and also the salads. They also have a great celery/carrot/PB/crackers/grapes combo thats a nice light option.   They're daily specials are delicious too! My favorite is the orange chicken with jasmine rice. Nice and lightly flavored!   I don't even work near them anymore, but I still visit!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome! I haven't had anything here that I didn't love. Prices and portions are perfect. There's tons of variety, just about anything you can think of has been the special of the day at least once. The only negative thing I can think of is they're always packed around noon so plan around that!"}
{"text":"I love the bistro as we call it here Arthur office next door. The prices are a little high, but the food and people who work there are great."}
{"text":"The BEST iced mochas. I worked at a specialty coffee shop a few years back and this place by far has the most delicious coffee I've ever had. Nice place to pick up lunch and coffee up before heading in to work for the day. The baristas are always so nice!"}
