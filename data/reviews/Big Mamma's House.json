{"text":"I went in regardless of mixed reviews and was not disappointed. I got there around 2pm and was the only customer there. I ordered The Big Canadian and Classic Poutine. 

Both were excellent. Service was quick and staff was friendly. 

Will definetly return if I am in the area again"}
{"text":"Customer service was soooo bad! Kids who are rushing to get you out the door. 
The menu was flashing on & off. You can't read the description of the burgers without it turning off. It was so annoying. 
One star for the ok Poutine. 
Burgers was ok nothing to come back for."}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints in the east end

Get the big mushroom if it's your first time!"}
{"text":"bass ackwards establishment.... waited about 15 minutes to be asked what I wanted to order while all thr girls in the front of the store chatted... got my food and it was amazing!... decided to come back for another visit and the food quality was significantly different.. not impressed.. won't be back"}
{"text":"The daughter ordered the 1lbs of smokey ribs with a side of poutine.  I had 20 wings 10 honey garlic and 10 smokey BBQ.   The size of the fountain drinks are a bit silly.  Could easily offer what you can get at McD's or Burger King (at twice the volume) for the same price. 

The poutine side was tasty but the fries were cool. The daughter didn't seem to mind but I would have sent them back.  The ribs are marinaded beef short ribs.  I guess it may offer more meat than pork ribs. But given that the ribs are sold by weight probably a better choice.  The sauce very smokey with a hint of spice.  

The daughter had her rib fix satisfied so it made for a good trip home."}
{"text":"Had the veggie poutine and buffalo/smoked bbq wings. Both were very good. Next time Im in canada I will def come back here again"}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant is very very slow. The burgers are a bit dry but the inside of the restaurant is clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"For me Big Mamma's is a little bit of a drive so I don't pass by here often. However from what I have experienced, I will continue going back for years.

There's many various options for burgers, and I would recommend (my favs) The Big Spice & The Big Mushroom (see below) though most of their menu items are pretty good. The flavour is there, and they got that beef bacon which I love so much.

The Big Spice (grilled jalapenos, spicy smoked sausage, melted monterey jack jalapeno, chipotle mayo, onions, pickles, lettuce, smoked spicy bbq sauce, hot banana peppers).

The Big Mushroom (sauteed mushrooms, melted smoked provolone cheese, smoked Canadian beef strips, sauteed red onions, lettuce, mayo).

One issue I have is that sometimes it can take a while to prepare the burgers so be prepared to wait; especially if it's busy. Though the restaurant (and booths) are fairly small, and the place can get quite busy, the food makes up for most shortfalls. Even the Classic burger is good (tip: if you want something simple but not boring, get a Classic burger with melted smoked provolone cheese and smoked beef strips added). And if you don't like it, get out of Big Mamma's House."}
{"text":"The wings and ribs were great! Very good customer service from both of the people behind the counter. They definitely treat customers well. Our burgers were undercooked and when we brought it to Naseef's attention he was very apologetic and refunded the burgers and gave up complimentary burgers that were cooked to perfection. I really appreciated his efforts and I'll definitely eat there again!!"}
{"text":"I always like to return to restaurants I've given poor ratings to. being a chef I know there are sometimes follies at businesses go through sometimes they employ the wrong type of employee, sometimes they're are slip ups and it's understandable and often unavoidable. 

I returned to big mamas house, I didn't want to wait a long time for a burger so I didn't bother. I just ordered a poutine and a drink. 

I got my poutine there was no cheese curds on it it was shredded mozzarella I told the girl at the counter and she said that's always how they make it (the menu clearly states cheese curds) Not wanting to argue I simply threw in the garbage and went to South Street burger to get a poutine."}
{"text":"Best burgers I ever had eating outside yo! That I ordered the Big Mamma's House around $14 for combo adding $2 you get the poutine with meat on it holy shit it is so high in calories but so good man. My friend and I was so full just with that good meal. Really the things are huge for guys like us whom even eat a lot. But really don't get the $10 burger combo so much smaller. $4  more so much bigger so better deal!!! O yea the Big Mamma's burger was so big it will not fit you mouth. It is huge 12oz of beef!"}
{"text":"Very slow service and the burgers are disgusting"}
{"text":"I went the first week this place was open. I think they had 3 staff. A cook, an order taker and a cashier. The wait was long and the burger tasted like every drop of moisture was removed. I never went back."}
{"text":"The service was really slow and the burgers we tried were a little too dry for my taste. I wouldn't travel to try this place out, but if I'm in the area I might give it another go."}
{"text":"Service was timely, they told me about 10-15 minutes for my food. Got my burger poutine and ribs in about 15 minutes. The interior design was well thought out, it has a classic but modern vibe. The chairs definitely need to be replaced, feeling a little back pain after the meal was done. The poutine was great. A more than generous amount of cheese curds were given , gravy and fries. The temperature of the gravy could be a little higher as it felt as if the poutine I was eating had been sitting out for a while , it wasn't hot but nonetheless it was good. The presentation of the burger was very simple yet appealing with the little toothpick that says come to big mammas house . The burger received no complaints I went for the classic burger which very good, the beef party was juicy and good in size. I ordered the brisket Ribs, they were Korean short rib style. The meat quality was better than expected, I would say AA or higher, but that comes at a cost for around 15 dollars you receive a pound a half which is a good lunch size portion but for dinner the two pounds would be recommended. The ribs were complimented with the smoked spicy BBQ, the taste was rich and almost overpowering at times, but great flavor. Overall a great experience and would definitely visit again ."}
