{"text":"Great food and a lot of menu options. Service has declined this season.  Pretty slow service. Was told the wait would be 40 min for a table and it was over an hour. Once seated, no one served us for a very long time because they forgot to assign our table to a server. I had to get up and find someone. Great food though and nice bright setting with views."}
{"text":"My friend and I ended up here for early lunch since visibility on the ski hill was very limited. Great place to hang out next to the fireplace. Staff was friendly don't service was all right, and they came around and refilled water in the form of bring us a new bottle of water to refill. We had dropped a fork by accident and one of the staff members came up quickly and give us a new set of cutlery wrapped in the black napkin.   Atmosphere was nice just for a casual conversation.the food was decent as well.we ordered a nachos and cheese which ended up being huge order.we tried the elk stew, and the kale salad.the nachos and cheese seemed really good with lots of cheese - my friend Said he would've wanted green onions, And maybe stuff like peppers. I really liked the Sauce on The kale salad."}
{"text":"This place has good food and decent prices.  For lunch, don't expect anything fancy as it's very much in line with your standard mountain lunch fare but their quality is undeniable. Their wine could have been better as the choices were very limited.  Service was very good and very friendly. Definitely suggest this place for your lunch fare on the mountain."}
{"text":"The view is definitely included in the price. I went for dinner and one standard portion of mushroom ravioli ran at $27 and the cream sauce on it could easily have been condensed mushroom soup with how thick and goopy it was. I dined with family and the best dish ordered at our table was the fish and chips, although it could easily have served two people. Basically anything with a cream sauce was spoiled by the thick gloopy sauce. The french onion soup and french fries were both very salty. Edible, but pleasant was in the rear view mirror. Service was good; mountains were beautiful."}
{"text":"Wow, great atmosphere, service, and beefdip. Ran out of draft beer but no worries! Fireplace runs all the time."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant. The views of the slopes are great, service is wonderful (specially if you have Eliza as your server) and food quality is good. As other reviewers have already mentioned, the location is great since this place is right in the middle of the slopes. Perfect place to stop over in the middle of the day for lunch or a drink after skiing, or like in my case, just hang out and have drinks and a byte to eat while waiting for some friends who were skiing. The place is very comfortable, with lots of tables right by the windows, but also a few very comfortable sofas for just lounging. Some of them are by the fireplace and some are by the windows. The Bourbon sours I had was espectacular... Buffalo Sour, and the Elk pot pie was pretty good. Great place to try."}
