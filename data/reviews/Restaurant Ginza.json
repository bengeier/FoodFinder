{"text":"Compared to Kanda, Ginza has a much better selection (especially for lunch) at a similar pricepoint.  However, service tends to be a bit slower than Kanda.  A great lunch place for AYCE on the plateau if you're not in a hurry."}
{"text":"Do not go here. 

In a nutshell, we were taken advantage of (the old lady server must have thought that because we were young, that we were also dumb), the service is SUPER slow, we were accused of not paying and were CHASED AFTER to come back, and one of us was physically harassed.

My sister (Alice K.) also posted about our experience on July 31st. Read her review to know why not to go here."}
{"text":"I've been loyal to this place for more than 3 years, and went there more than a dozen times. 

The negative: this place is SLOW! It's a family business, they make the roll as you order not in the industrial-like setting of Kanda or Sushi St-Denis. Sometimes it can take up to 45min to get your order, so better know what you want from the get go. I went there last night and it took us a bout 2.5h to go through 3 orders for 2 persons. It's really annoying. Also they get the orders wrong time to time. So I understand the frustration of many here (we were too yesterday tbh). Not sure I'll come back if they don't increase  their service next time I'm there.

The positive: the best all you can eat sushi (AYCE) of Montreal. Period!

I'm of course not comparing that to the best sushi restaurants of Montreal, but among all AYCE here, it's hands down the best (almost tried them all!). The price is slightly more expensive than the more industrial type of AYCE (like 2 bucks more), but, again it's really worth it!

Bottom line, don't go there if you're in a hurry. Go there for the family feeling, but above all, go there for the quality of the sushi and sashimi!!!

ps: if you don't like mayo, they'll change it, if you want something just made for you, they'll do it and not roll their eyes, and they'll keep smiling all the time, so be nice and tip them well! :)

pps: yesterday's experience was really subpart, even for the quality of sushis, I just hope that it was a isolated case. Will give them another shot next time"}
{"text":"If you decided to try this place. You need to make sure that you are not very hungry and they don't have more than 3 tables of customers. This place is really slow on the service and with a lot of pickup/delivery orders. The food is so so consider that you are in Montreal and you can not compare the quality of Japanese food here with other bigger cities like Toronto or Vancouver. The buffet menu is big but the average wait time is way too long. There were couple of complains about the wait during my visit and couple of complains from the phone about the never arrive deliveries. I personally won't come back again when there are 2 other better sushi buffet in town."}
{"text":"Came here with my sister and cousins for dinner on Thursday (7/31) night. We were hungry and found Ginza after reading the reviews on Yelp and other sites. We were seated at an un-prepped table (not a big deal), but the red flags began to pop up once we were given the menu...

On the website, they provide a menu. When we were at our table, the older lady gave us an all-you-can-eat menu. We asked ourselves if we had missed the AYCE sign outside or that maybe the website wasn't updated so it became an AYCE place? We asked the lady if we could get a regular menu and she goes, \"oh yes, okay\" and brings us a menu of combos for larger parties (so the combos were around $30-60). She comes back around asking if we're ready to order and we ask her again for a regular menu... like, a la carte. She plays dumb and says again, \"ohhh yes, okay, I bring\". Finally, she brings the *regular* *a la carte* menu that we should've gotten first (mind you, she only brought us two menus for four of us and the menus weren't even the same...). So our moods change a bit obviously because we feel like we're being taken advantage of. Maybe it's because we're not from the city or maybe it's because we're girls in our 20s? 

So finally we order and we wait for a REALLY long time for our food to arrive. No checks on filling up our glasses either. We don't mind too much because we're really getting hungry now. Finally our food arrives and it looks good. One of our dishes doesn't arrive for about 30 minutes after 3 of us had already gotten ours. We ask how long it's going to be (btw, the place is filling up by now) and she says \"coming, coming\". Okay... 

So we wait and we wave her down to ask again how long it might be (she's the only server while there are now about 6 tables of just-arrived diners. There was one man making the sushi behind the counter, and one man we saw earlier who might've been working in the kitchen in the back? Anyway, they were clearly understaffed). She again says that it's coming so we wait some more. The shrimp teriyaki (btw, shrimp doesn't take very long to cook...) arrives and we dig in. At least the food makes up for the service...

The bill comes and she separates them for us. We each pay cash, but my cousin's meal is overcharged. She explains that in one of the menus (remember how we got two different menus? I'm guessing the items were priced differently), that the price was a few dollars less. The lady ARGUES with her saying that it's a mistake. My cousin asks to see the menu again so that she can show her and she just keeps saying no. Now I don't work in the food industry, but a couple of dollars shouldn't make a huge difference in a restaurant, especially when you want the customer to leave somewhat happy). 

We each pay finally (cash, no change needed) so we leave. We walk down the block and ask we're nearing the next block, THE LADY RUNS AFTER US, *GRABS* MY COUSIN (the one that had been overcharged), does NOT let go of my cousin's arm and accuses us of leaving without paying. I WAS SO CONFUSED. My cousin says to her, \"um, excuse me, do NOT put your hand on me\". I tell her that we did pay, that we left without needing change. She argues with us again and motions for us to come back with her hand still around my cousin's arm (to which my cousin is shocked at the physical harassment) and I tell her no, that we did pay and that it's on the table. This lady would not back down so we go all the way back with thoughts of her maybe even pocketing the money and saying we didn't pay just because we were \"difficult\" customers. We get to the table where we sat and guess what? THE MONEY (ALL OF OUR MONEY) IS ON THE TABLE WHERE WE LEFT IT. 

Needless to say, we left not only with bad service while we dined, but also left being accused of not paying AND being physically harassed."}
{"text":"It is sad because the quality is pretty ok, there is a family-owned vibe, the area could use some better cheap restos.

But these folks just didn't have their stuff together to run an all you can eat.

It was kind of pricy and limited and poorly executed.

I would say go for regular rolls if you are nearby and want sushi, but otherwise check out Montreal's other all-you-can-eat options."}
{"text":"I should preface this by stating that this could be the fault of the brochure I found this restaurant in.  I found it in citemenu.com which claims a delivery booklet for the H3G area (downtown).

I chose this place because it had a combo of 22 pieces for $15 and it had a \"visa\" symbol, which meant I could pay by visa at the door - or so I thought.

I called them up and asked for the combo and was told that I'm too far away to deliver a $15 order.  I replied that they are listed in the downtown citemenu brochure but the woman on the other end told me she didn't understand.  She insisted I order more to make it worthwhile so I ordered a large combo for 2 with the plan to eat half for lunch tomorrow.

The delivery came in about 70-80 minutes - not an issue in the blizzard we're experiencing - but the guy at the door, who was a young French overseas worker, told me he was sent because I didn't request visa on the phone. He told me he'll come round again the next day to collect the cash. I blame the restaurant for causing a real inconvenience for both of us.  If it had been an issue, then they should have asked me what payment method I'd be using.

Beware!"}
{"text":"Best all you can you can eat sushi restaurant. Slightly more expensive than Kanda but much better quality."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed all the dishes I tried here and I haven't had better all you can eat sushi that I can remember. There is a huge price difference between lunch and dinner, so if you can swing a huge lunch that would be your best value. There are a couple of dishes that are only available on Fri/Sat evening (the most expensive time) but nothing indispensable. 

No drinks are included in the all you can eat menu, which is too bad, but they were good about keeping my water full."}
{"text":"No no no no no! That's really all I can get myself to type at the moment.......

Maybe if I summarize the problems you'll understand.

1. It took THREE hours to get ONE order of sushi for 3 people. The restaurant wasn't at capacity either.  . . . . . . . 

2. We ordered 8 spring rolls for 3 people. The new owner I assume (a really pissy lady who was bossing everyone in the kitchen around) came to us and said: \"You ordered 8. That's too much. I give you 3\"......... We said that we wanted 8 especially since they didn't bring half our order and that it had been close to 3 hours by that point. She brought us 6. We were then told that if we want the rest we can get it AFTER we finish the 6.........

3. Terrible service - many of the items brought to us were not ours...and our orders were not brought to us.

Basically, and in a nut shell, not coming back. 

They just lost 2 super loyal customers."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I had an average experience- it was definitely not the best sushi I've had in Montreal and I even thought to myself it was rather unworthy of a return. 

Then, for some reason beyond me, I was desperate for sushi one night and decided to order from here. It was one of the few places I could order from, so I went for it. I paid an arm and a leg for an order that could have been amazing, but was far from it. I woke up in the middle of the night with extreme pain in my stomach that I had never felt before and spent an hour (on and off) vomiting. 

Two words: FOOD - POISONING.

Bye."}
{"text":"Ginza is a trap. It used to be good 2 to 3 years ago, but I've started to avoid this place since, in my opinion, they changed administration. The tempura is super oily and terrible, and the maki's are 90% rice, 9% ingredients, 1% seaweed.

I have been going to Ginza monthly back in the days, but it's no longer an option for me anymore.

To avoid if you are a true sashimi, nigiri, tempura and maki fan.

Although the service never changed, an all-you-can-eat sushi is about the quality of their food. No good food + good service = still not a good restaurant."}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying that this is the first sushi restaurant I've reviewed in Montreal, and maybe I'm a bit biased because I just moved from Vancouver, but I didn't enjoy this experience at all.

I ordered delivery of seaweed salad, imperial rolls, peanut butter ravioli, eel maki, hamachi sashimi, albacore sashimi, salmon roll and butterfly roll. The plan was to order lots of food and then have some of it it for lunch and dinner the next day.

First off, I waited and hour and the food still hadn't arrived, so I called them and it showed up within a few minutes. Obviously someone forgot about me. Naturally, the hot food was cold by the time it got to me.

Seaweed salad: Was pretty standard, except for some cucumber sticks sitting in the bottom - I couldn't really figure out how it made sense to put them in there at all. The sesame seeds were nice.

Imperial roll: Greasy, bland, weird sticky dipping sauce. 

Peanut butter ravioli: Stay away. Bland and mushy ravioli. Actually, it was bland except for the overpowering slices of ginger inside. Thick overwhelming sauce that tasted like it came out of a jar.

Hamachi and albacore sashimi: Small. Expensive considering the quality of the fish wasn't exactly stellar. Not only that, green onions were sprinkled all over it. Who wants green onions with that kind of fish? The flavour is supposed to be subtle.

Sake maki: This is the only thing I have no complaints about. The fish was of good quality, was in perfect balance with the rice and there was plenty of it. If I had to do it over, I would have skipped the sashimi and ordered two more of these.

Unagi maki: Not bad. No major complaints about this one, but there wasn't a lot of eel in there. 

Butterfly roll: My first thought was 'wow, that's kind of small'. My second thought was 'wow, that's a huge chunk of cream cheese'. The roll was kind of bland, and it wasn't improved by the cream cheese.

So needless to say, I won't be back again. The two stars are for the Sake and Unagi rolls."}
{"text":"I went to Ginza for lunch on a Wednesday with my partner and we ate from the buffet menu. The options were limited but the food was good. My partner was in fact extremely pleased, repeating how much the food was better than most other sushi buffets in Montreal (the best affordable buffet we've been to is still in Toronto however). The service was a bit on the slow-side but it was still acceptable. As a vegetarian, I can say that the veggie options were extremely few, even compared to other sushi buffets, but the ones they served were good. I recommend the mushroom and tofu tempura."}
