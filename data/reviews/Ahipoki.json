{"text":"So good and so fresh! Love this place and I am there regularly. Workers are super nice and always willing to help out new customers with the menu. Everything is great and I've never had a problem with bad food or lack of fresh fish!"}
{"text":"This place is a f---ing amazing I've been eating at the Scottsdale location almost every working day for the last 3 months. Can be a little intimidating at first but after the first time through the line getting exactly what you want you'll be happy!  I almost  always  do the half and half with the house spicy dressing, If you're a first-timer that's where I would start."}
{"text":"Such a nice alternative to sushi. I really like their cream sauce and house sauce. The portions are large for the price. And super fresh! Save room for Brick Macaron Ice Cream sand which! I loooove macaroons, and these are delish!"}
{"text":"I really liked my first visit.  Will be back for sure.  It was pretty slow when I went in though, and I felt like it could have been a bit cleaner inside......Food was great though."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Ahipoki Bowl! What a great concept! I love that you can pick and choose anything/everything you want. Service was quick and staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"The food was good (but I swear the fish portions have gotten smaller than before), but the place was in terrible disarray. If it was just dirty after a lunch session, that would be noted and no big deal. However, the problems were much more of a replace or repair nature. There's a hole in the floor for a drain that sticks out from the drink and utensil area, that is not easy to maneuver around when multiple people are there. The drink machine, the tea containers, and the \"accessories\" canisters were caked with debris and misc build-up that was not just a one-day thing.  I did notice that they only had 2 people visible on staff at the time I was there. Maybe it's a staffing issue. I don't know."}
{"text":"What can I tell?!   Living for sometime on in Hawaii, I love poke bowls. When this place was just opened, I loved it and was coming to enjoy fresh poke. However, they are totally killed their business by making portions smaller and smaller. I mean, you can still get the same size, but instead of raw fish in your bowl expect more rice and salad. Last time it was a complete disaster, I ordered large portion with 3 scoops of fish, however I barely got 10 small pieces of it. Paying $14 without drink and getting probably 2 oz of actual TUNA POKE, it should be called SMELL OF AHIPOKE. It is joke, you just lost another customer. There are many like me on on yelp."}
{"text":"Have been there a couple of times.  Raw fish out in the open, exposed to the air, umm that makes me nervous.  Did see them a couple times actually measuring the food temperature.  That reassured me, and have been back again and again.   Staff is always courteous, and friendly.  The place is always busy, too which is a good sign.   Will happily return!"}
{"text":"I tried Ahipoki Bowl for  the First time yesterday. I was VERY Happy. I ordered the Large To Go & ate Half for Lunch & the Rest for Dinner. I went back Today ... Well I was LESS than Pleased . The same order was about HALF the size of Yesterday ..... & the Gal actually REMOVED some of the Fish that She had put on !!!  Was She COUNTING the Pieces ?? Yesterday I Ordered  the Shrimp & they Dropped a Few out of my Dish ... I did NOT see them REPLACE that ... But they \"Take Back\" what they put in your Order ?? REALLY ?? I paid Extra for more  \"Smelt Eggs\" ...  She really Scrapped that spoon ... Got about an Extra Quarter size amount. Even the amount of LETTUCE was almost NIL. REALLY .... LETTUCE ??? Atleast THAT would have made it look like a Meal for $ 13.00. I tried to call when I got Home ... can NOT get Ahold of ANYONE !! I thought this would be my New \"GO TO\" Place .... Having Second Thoughts. The Food IS Good .... BUT ... Expect a Bit More for the Money."}
{"text":"This place is like your topical chain poke place. I had two scoops of salmon and one scoops of tuna. I had half rice and half salad. I ended up going back and asking for more rice because I'm used to larger portions from Korean restaurants. ( Hwe dup bop) They were kind and gave me the side of rice at no additional price. Their sauces are super salty so if your watching your sodium intake ask them to go easy on the sauces."}
{"text":"Good place to fulfill your sushi cravings. You'll notice how busy this place is but the line move so quickly. Super fresh and price is not bad. Try the half and half. It takes a lot to fill me up, but my order was enough for lunch."}
{"text":"Not a sushi/poke fan here... I am writing this review for my spouse who absolutely LOVES ahipoke bowl. We have tried other places that are just not as good. The line can get long though and the price is a little high."}
{"text":"First time here today and went based on Yelp reviews. Definitely not disappointed and will be back!  Ordered exactly what they suggested which was mix of salad & rice with salmon & marinated tuna...fantastic!"}
{"text":"Not sure how to feel about this place after eating there 3 times. The first time I ate there with a friend, I was excited and curious and I really enjoyed it! But over time, I'm less and less impressed with the food, service, and ambiance.   The last time I visited ahipoki after having a poke craving, I was with my 5 yr old  sister and she wanted to order a rice bowl with no fish, only toppings such as edamame. All of the workers seemed incredibly flustered at my request, and I had to keep asking different people to accommodate me. Finally, one employee told me that they could not serve children due to health reasons, which would make sense if I was asking them to give her raw fish- which I was not. Anyways I mentioned to her that last time I was there, I was able to get a rice bowl with a few toppings. \"Our policies have changed\" she told me. Within one week? I'm not so sure about that... But I kept asking and it took about 10 extra minutes of waiting and arguing to get someone to finally fulfill my decently simple request. It kind of killed the vibe at that point.   The second problem I had with this location (I have not been to the Scottsdale one) is the ambiance. The dubstep music they've been playing really started to get on my nerves. It was honestly making my head hurt and was not enjoyable. I finished my meal somewhat uncomfortably and felt kinda ehh about the whole experience. I'll probably come back -just because I love poke so much-  but I'm not as excited about this find as I was at first."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is okay. Sometimes the employees just don't seem like they're in a good mood."}
{"text":"Love love this place! Their Poki salad with house dressing is phenomenal! I hope they build a location closer to Gilbert. This location is just a bit too far to drive to."}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy(ish), and quick if you can get there without a huge line. My only complaint? I can't eat it now because I am pregnant! I can't wait to have it again!"}
{"text":"This place is worth every penny! Fresh delicious ingredients. Its a must try...you will be coming back...now they need one in gilbert"}
{"text":"Best place for a healthier alternative fast food restaurant. Since I am a big sushi fan this is the best place for raw fish. Also the tropical drink and Thai iced tea are very good. Very close to Ice den Chandler so it is easy for me to get to games too."}
{"text":"Fresh tasting, not generous portions but was satisfied, employees could be a tad friendlier, I think its fresh fish and we are in Arizona but I still think the price was a bit steep for about 5 small cubes of tuna and boy did they make sure the spoon was leveled off! Concept is great and everything tasted good. Clean restaurant and nice presentation.   We will go back but probably not frequently. And will skip 1/2&1/2 and get all salad next time."}
{"text":"Have visited here twice. This place is too busy to go on the lunch during working days. I would suggest this place might be better to open the drive through lane."}
{"text":"Yummy! Fresh veggies and poke.  Definitely worth the visit!  The service was fast even when there was a long line at lunch time."}
{"text":"Kevin and the rest of the team were helpful and informative.. very fresh tasting and a great new concept.  Come to the northwest valley!!"}
{"text":"I just discovered poke bowls a few weeks ago, and it's become one of my favorite things to eat! This place was quick and convenient. Very tasty, hit the spot  will be returning. The portion was perfect."}
{"text":"First visit here, I was like , \"Okay, this is good but kind of pricey for what you get. Also, its a bit of a drive for to get to.\"  Second visit: Every portion was smaller than the time before. I asked for a little more seaweed because it was the most pathetic little scoop. I was told there would be an extra charge. Okay - Whatever....... Then the girl apologizes because she noticed my frustration after the second up charge. She mentioned how the owners have cut down on the portions. Yet a small bowl and a drink will cost you $16.00!   Third Visit:  Today - They manage to once again go even smaller on the portions.. Are you kidding me? I know when I am being ripped off. So I kindly ask staff for a manager and he questions why...  When I explained how it's kind of a bummer to be getting charged for smaller portions he was like , \"Well the portions are the same.\"  But they're not.  I feel silly writing reviews but I am just so disappointed in the staff and the way they took my comment so personally but offered no explanation or resolution. He then immaturely  comments how they've made 8k in sales. Really? Then I turn around to see them all laughing and talking about me. Including one staff female who was sitting at the table rolling her eyes at me. I felt so embarrassed but mostly in disbelief about how the staff acted. I cant go back even if I wanted to.  Ray and the 101 Just opened \"Pokitrition\" thankfully because I wont go out of my way for this place again. They 100 percent lost a customer who was more than willing to keep coming back after my first visit."}
{"text":"The poke itself and the Thai tea were awesome! However like other yelpers have noted the service is awful. Not one \"hello\" or smile, the first thing the girl said was \"rice or salad?\" With a sour look.  Also, I have to say the green tea ice cream macaroon sandwich was pretty gross, but we might be back for the poke if we're ever in the area again."}
{"text":"FINALLY! Healthy fast food SUSHI! The concept is like Chipotle, making choices as you go. LOVE IT! I actually give it 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place out for the first time tonight and we are HOOKED!! I am a huge octopus person and the fact that they have it on their menu and it tastes good is huge! You can get a rice bowl or a salad. You have a handful of options as far as fish and a handful of options for toppings and sauces. We are definetly going to be coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"Okay so I never order from post mates because I'm in the service industry and know how it can be that they don't tip or typically get orders correct when you special order. But I was extremely busy and couldn't manage to get out to pick up an ahi bowl been dying for one!! So long story short I called in and spoke with Jason the GM and he was so helpful and accommodating to my specific requests and even called me back to ensure that the marinade wasn't going to be a conflicting issue.   As someone who bartend s and serves its nice to know that there are others who also care about their customers personal preferences and go the little extra mile to ensure it's done right.   I'll absolutely be ordering from this location only when it comes to my poke bowl splurges. Thank you again Jason!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Went today and didn't know what to expect. Really enjoyed my salad with crab and tuna. Peanut oil salad dressing was relish!"}
{"text":"A little pricey, but if you get the half and half with two scoops and crab salad add on you will be full all day!  Sushi lovers dream!Try the two house salad dressings mixed together too."}
{"text":"Not impressed  When they were first opened they had bigger serving bowls and gave adequate portions  Oh my have they changed! Cost has gone up and portion way smaller The guy gave me an half and inch of sprouts  Maybe 10 soy beans .... and told me when I ask for more sprouts he would have to charge me more!!! I'm shocked I recommended this place to so many  Now I'm embarrassed"}
{"text":"This location is better than What I went yesterday in Scottsdale... Karina treated us and felt more welcome."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and this time might be my last. Their food is really delicious and their service is fast. This time around I got a scoop of spicy tuna and a scoop of shrimp. As I was eating my food I bit down on what I thought might of been a fish bone, but after checking it out I almost wish it had been that. This piece of metal was in my food, now I don't know if it was in the fish or maybe mixed in with something else. The manager did refund our money and was apologetic about the situation. I love the food, but after this experience I don't want to bring my family back."}
{"text":"My voice was heard!  I am so thrilled that they opened this location.  I used to drive to their Scottsdale location from Maricopa and pleaded a few times to have another franchise in Chandler.  Thank you for listening!  I was born and raised on the island of Maui.  I ate poke almost everyday.  Although some naysayers  will complain that it's not like the marinated poke in Hawaii, they can try to make their own poke at home.  Good luck!  It's expensive to buy sushi grade ahi or salmon.  I like poke with limu and inamona, but you can't get it here in AZ.  That being said, I think these guys actually make an awesome marinade.  I always ask for the house and sweet citrus sauce, and that is close to what we used to eat as shoyu poke.    So for me, this is so much cheaper than eating sushi.  One roll of specialty sushi is like a price of their bowl.  I am full and satisfied after my meal.  I always order my bowl with salad greens and I don't feel guilty when I come here, which is too often."}
{"text":"I have been twice to this location. First time I had received  $5 coupon for their grand opening. I had great experience,  great customer service. The lady helping me was very informative.  I had been bragging to my sister of this great place and we decided to go today. Again great customer from the staff. My only complaint is they were very and I mean very light on the add-ons which made it look very plain. I guess depends on the person making  it the customer sitting next to me their bowl looked fuller than mine.  We both had their tropical drink. Its delicious and refreshing!"}
{"text":"I am so happy they opened up right next to where I live! I love the yellowtail, salmon and spicy tuna and all the different toppings. Especially the avocado, cucumber and daikon sprouts. It's super fresh and good portions. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the sauce that's way too salty and sweet for me, and they put too much on. So far I've tried the house and the creamy spicy mixed with house, so will have to experiment more. The spicy creamy is pretty yummy, though. Maybe will try getting the sauce on the side so I can control how much goes on. They have lemons at the side counter, so I might just like lemon juice best. They're also super nice and gave me extra cucumbers when I asked."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious. I could eat my weight in this daily. Love it. Fresh tasting, flavorful and healthy. So glad this is right next to my house. I will be there frequently!! My mainstay is:  Salad with two scoops of fresh fish, salmon and tuna, house dressing, avocado, scoop of crab, edamame, cucumber, dried seaweed flakes and toasted sesame seeds. Heaven on a plate. For Real."}
{"text":"Restaurant and bathroom were clean. Food tasted fresh with some variety items like kimchi, different sauces. Good service. The thing I didn't like was extra charges for \"basic\" items: yellowtail, avocado, masago, crabmeat each cost extra."}
{"text":"We're visiting from Chicago driving from Phoenix to Tucson. Pulled up Yelp and came because the pics. We were disappointed by Sushirito in San Francisco, but this is not SF. I just finished eating, I rarely write reviews, but this NEEDED one. Worker behind counter walked us through entire process and was super nice. This needs to be in Chicago like 10 minutes ago, it. would. make. a. KILLING! Get off Yelp and get here!"}
{"text":"Terrific service! The portions were large and there was a great variety of toppings! We will definitely be back!  Thanks Joshua!"}
{"text":"By far the best Poke Bowl spot in Phoenix!  Fish is pretty fresh [for AZ standards]... Good size portions... Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's so clean and customer service is great, it was my first time trying food like this and I definitely be coming back and will be letting friends and family know about it"}
{"text":"I have visited Ahipoki, Pokitrition and Poke Wave (all within 2 miles of each other).  I believe that Ahipoki is the best of the 3 restaurants.  It's all about trimming their seafood correctly.  You know it's been trimmed right when you don't get any tendons or connective tissue in your tuna.  That's not a good feeling when you bite into a piece of poorly cut tuna and get that chewy white tendon.  I've had this happen at Pokitrition and Poke Wave but never at Ahipoki.  For this reason, I will continue going to Ahipoki Bowl."}
{"text":"Something new and different . Teriyaki bowl with sushi. Tons of options and good flavor"}
{"text":"Food was great but the service from the ENTIRE staff was terrible. They were very rude to not only me but my family. Twice we've gone in and they have been rude to us. I don't think I'll ever go there again (maybe I'll go to the one in Scottsdale) and I will be sure to spread the word about the service. If I could give it no stars I would."}
{"text":"Found this by accident on the way to another lunch location. what a happy surprise! Staff was helpful since I hadn't been there before, recommending items and explaining how it all goes. Its like a Chipotle for Ahi Salad. Items were fresh and tasty. The spicy Cream sauce, is the perfect amount of heat. They even offered Octopus - YUM! Definitely going back soon !"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, staff is very helpful and knowledgeable.  The portion sizes were perfect especially for the price.  Look forward to returning when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"First time customer at this location and restaurant, had the Tuna Luau and Blazing Salmon bowl which was amazing.  Drew, the manager if I recall correctly, and staff guided me through my first time eating here and were friendly and super helpful!  Keep up the good work..."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see that Ahipoke was opening a new location so close to my home! Their other locations are near my office and church so I've frequented them on a regular basis. They're by far my favorite poke restaurant in Phoenix.  The food is your classic poke where you pick a base (rice/lettuce), protein, sauce and toppings. It's always been fresh and tasty!  The design of this one is the same as their other locations. There's another seating area beyond where the soda machine is so keep heading back. You can enter on the east or west side of the building but the main entrance is on the east side (the side by Fry's)."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite places to eat when I don't have time for sit down sushi. I frequented this establishment probably 2-3 times a week to suffice my sushi cravings. In fact I've been sad because I still crave it, but due to my dietary restrictions I can no longer eat here and will miss it greatly. Don't pass this place up if you love sushi as it is like the chipotle version of sushi food except even better and healthier."}
{"text":"Could be your new favorite place. Ordered regular size  \"half & half\" which consisted of 1/2 salad and 1/2 rice with choice of fish and toppings. Selected spicy tuna, salmon, seaweed, wasabi, cucumber and sprouts. Paid $1 extra for avocado, and the generous portion was well worth the upcharge. Ahipoki bowl exceeded expectations! Delicious melody of flavors and freshness. Fast, courtesious service and reasonable price. Food left me feeling satisfied and healthy.  Highest recommendation."}
{"text":"I stumbled in on grand opening day, and I'm so glad I did! The ingredients are fresh and they don't skimp. Everyone was very friendly. Only gripe is they listed brown rice on the menu and didn't have any. I will be back often!"}
{"text":"Love this place for a good poke bowl!! $10 for regular size, nice friendly staff, clean and fresh!  Spicy House sauce was great. Next time I'll try half Spicy House/half Creamy Siracha!! Octopus was great!"}
{"text":"I've had poke bowls before and I was waiting for this to open since it's close to home. I tried it for the first time today and let's just say it was mediocre. First off they only give you two size options (regular and large) and the regular is too small but the large is too big. The place I usually go to offers small, medium, and large. Second, I paid $11 for a small bowl that was just okay. I got white rice with spicy tuna and Kimchi Shrimp. The spicy tuna has a nice kick but the shrimp didn't taste like much at all. I also added avocado which was $1.50 extra. The crab salad was just that, a salad so it was mixed with stuff and didn't have much flavor. Also, I was the only person in line and I felt so rushed. The employees didn't ask if I had been there before or how much of each I can have. The customer service wasn't very great. I felt like I was being rushed out and I didn't really get to look at all my options. Lastly, the don't mix your sauce with your mix ins, rather just pour it on top.  It wasn't horrible, it was just okay. And if I'm going to be paying a lot for a small portion it better be good.  If you haven't tried Poke Bar in Deer Valley, then you wouldn't understand this review. The food is way fresher there, you actually get pieces of avocado for cheaper ($1.00) rather then a scoop of mushed avocado, they actually have crab meat (not a salad) that is sooo fresh, they separate the cold shrimp from the rice until it's mixed in with your choice of sauces and sides, they're friendlier, and you can choose a size medium and get your monies worth."}
{"text":"First visit..very happy to see this new addition to the neighborhood. Wonderful fresh healthy affordable meals. Drew, the general manager, runs a good operation with a friendly well trained team. Will be back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place. Love how simple the menu is and how fresh the fish is! I can seriously eat here everyday. Staff is friendly and service is fast, perfect for lunch or a quick weeknight dinner. Easy to eat at the restaurant or pick up and take home for dinner.   Prices are great for fresh tasting fish and toppings of your choice. Love that I can combine two different types of fish and different marinates. I can eat there everyday of the week and get different combinations so I never get bored of the same thing.   When I went the person I front of me had never had poke and asked tons of questions and asked for help making the \"perfect bowl\" the staff answered all questions and was very patient with the newbie. I appreciate the professionalism of the staff but still kept the line moving.   I will continue to eat here a few days a week. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Yummmy and value for $$$. Staff is friendly and bother to explain how we should order. Must try!"}
{"text":"first visit...confusing ordering. But oh man, the payoff! What a great addition/option to the stable of eateries around here. Sushi lovers rejoice. Fish is fresh tasting and building your order is pretty cool. You just have to come to see what I mean. think reversed engineered sushi roll, inside out. It's amazing. I had Poké in Kauai and am thrilled to now have the chance to grab a quick yummy fix here in my backyard. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and great tasting poke!  At almost every stage of choosing what you wanted, the worker would ask if the amount he gave was enough--something that's not typical of restaurants where you \"create-your-own\" dish. He also gave us a hefty scoop of fish--another thing that isn't typical of these types of restaurants, as they normally just give you the bare minimum.   My mom has to have her food gluten free because of a food allergy. The worker knew right away to change his gloves, and was extremely helpful in offering her gluten free options.   Restaurant atmosphere is nice and clean, and it has a few TV's to watch sports or the news.   Overall had a great experience here and would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I had the half rice and half salad. I decided to get the brown rice to be more healthy. For my meats, I selected the spicy tuna and the salmon. For the sauce, I chose the house spicy, which is actually a mixture of two of the other sauces. Then, for the toppings, I had the green onion, daikon radish sprouts, ginger, masago, edamame, and the crab salad. After that, I had the crispy onion flakes and furikake seaweed flakes sprinkled on top. I like how the food is healthy and that getting my meal is fairly quick.  I liked the blazing salmon. It says that the blazing salmon is limited time, which I am sad about because it tasted pretty good and I would want to get it the next time I go, but it might not be offered at that time."}
{"text":"So, my friend kept recommending this place and I was skeptical.  He described it as \"Fast Food Poke\" which didn't sound good to me.  Boy, was I wrong.  This place is amazing.  We went there this week and I am already scheming about how we can go again.  I highly recommend.  And btw, it is fast, but it's really good quality.  The staff was also super friendly and helpful during my first visit and let me try all the sauces."}
{"text":"Delicious poke ... as good as any I've had in SoCal! Love all the toppings offered. A new favorite"}
{"text":"We have been coming here since they opened and have the best service and food.  I am now quite upset how today was and felt that I was brushed off with 2 coupons which wasn't what I wanted.  I ordered the Tuna Laua and I saw there was a bit left in one pan (see picture) and a fresh set right next to it.  Well the guy proceeded to use what was left in the pan and when I asked for the fresher one he said he could make this other one better by adding things to it.  I asked why I couldn't just have the fresh.  He said fine and then proceeded to put back the tuna he put with my rice in the line!!! Huge healthcode violation.  Then the other person was using gloves that she touched food with to mess with change in the register.  I was really disappointed today in the fact that the staff thought I was crazy for wanting the fresh food for my $12 bowl.  Just a disappointing lunch with my husband today."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a month for lunch because it's conveniently located close to my office and I like the food. Today I had a less than stellar experience, however. I ordered a large bowl, specifically because I'm doing Keto and can't have the rice to fill me up, so I was looking for a big poke salad to fill me up (they usually don't skimp on the greens). The salad base was small this time, unfortunately, but I was making small talk with the employee so I didn't notice until I got back to work to eat (or else I would have asked for a bit more). I added avocado, which she warned would cost extra. I agreed anyway, although the avocado was brown and didn't look very fresh or worthy of costing extra. Lastly, each scoop they give you is tiny. If you get seaweed salad, you'll be lucky to get more than a pinch. Anything more costs extra. Same goes for all the other add-ons. Anyway, the food is good, employees are generally nice, but all in all I shouldn't still feel hungry after spending $15 on a large salad bowl with a drink."}
{"text":"Always fresh and delicious. The regular half and half (salad and rice) is my favorite. Ask for the house spicy on the salad and than just a light drizzle of the spicy creamy over everything!"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 5 stars but they have a few small things to fix. My meal alone was 5 stars. Incredible flavors, fresh shrimp, good salad, it was amazing and perfectly filling.  My husband's was 3-4 stars as he paid extra for more fish and his salmon was really chunky and not cut through all the way, which made it difficult for him to eat. In fact, he ate all his other fish and left the salmon out because it was so difficult to eat.  And the only other thing I hope they fix is adding a changing table to their bathrooms. It's not fun changing your child on the ground in a bathroom or in the backseat of a hot car. I saw lots of other families with babies here so I'm sure they'd appreciate it too.  I'll definitely be back and look forward to trying the scallops next!"}
{"text":"Yummy. Healthy. Two great combos. I've had not issue with service as some reported. They offer samples if your stuck with on a choice. I mean x the brown and white rice. I need to go gluten free so curious if sauces with no gluten....id be excited."}
{"text":"Wow, great find. Got a large bowl with marinated ahi, octopus, and salmon.  Mixed in with fresh greens, seagrass salad, brown rice, spicey dressing, avocado, and other toppings. All so fresh, great flavors.  Ate every bite. I appreciate prepared giving a good explanation on how it all works."}
{"text":"I won a free bowl on Instagram and came in and said so showing my phone screen with the prize coupon that was emailed to me. I shared with the lady building it who said what do you want? I said any size? She said yes. So I asked for the large 3 scoops. She starts building a small and I said is that a large so she restarts a large with attitude and shoves it off to someone else in a huff. I build the bowl with 2 nice men, get excited and go to check out only to have the manager say I needed to print my prize card. I'm like what? Who has a printer nowadays? I asked if I can text it to her, she says no and shows me one someone printed out. I said no one mentioned anything about printing anything (and why would they?) I also said it has my name on it, I don't understand. I said well you have a printer don't you? She says yes. I said then why can't I text it to you and you print it out? She would not be agreeable so I threw my hands up and walked out. Too bad since I was going to feature it on my blog's instagram. Good place from what I hear but the manager has a serious attitude problem."}
{"text":"Good place to have poke. Clean and fresh good flavor and quality. Not the best but no real complaints here."}
{"text":"I fell in love with Ahi Poke bowl when they first opened it in Scottdale.  The food was amazing and the staff were friendly and helpful.  I live in chandler, so you can imagine my excitement when I read that they were opening a new one closer to me.  Went there on opening day and was surprised on how small the dining area was.  The line was about out the door, so I didn't know where my husband and I would sit. We got lucky and grabbed a table. Another surprise I had was the fish. It didn't taste as fresh as the one in Scottsdale, which was weird. And because staff was different, that means different work ethics. They seemed overwhelmed and distracted. So, today was my second visit because I wanted to give it time for the place to kind of get it together. The experience with staff was better and the food was way better.  The only issue would be the dining area.  Way too small and have to ask people if my husband and I could sit with them.  Probably wouldn't be too weird, until we get denied.  Which we did today and had to go to another table to ask them.  Uncomfortable. Hopefully they will add outside seating soon or just expand."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  We really enjoyed the fresh fish and friendly service.   It was our first time and they explained all the flavors and sauces.     The dining room read very clean and the serving area was very clean add well.   Great music played at just the right level.    The only downside is the sauces.   Everything seemed a little more on the daily side than u would like it.   Even without  sauce,  everything still tasted really good."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful service, and plenty of seating for customers. Would highly recommend to any poke/sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"I definitely recommend coming to this poki restaurant because the service is great and they give you nice portions to get you full! When I'm craving poki, this will have to be my go to place to eat fresh fish with fresh toppings. The sauces are also incredible and highly recommend the spicy creamy sauce because it's not too spicy but there is still that mild heat to it. It's a great sauce to go with the fish and the salad or rice!"}
{"text":"I was beyond ecstatic to see that ahipoki bowl was opening by my house. I went in there the first day they were open and said hi I'm caitlyn and I'll be here everyday. While I haven't been there everyday I have been 3 times in the last week. The seafood is fresh, the serving size is plenty. You can get white rice, brown rice, salad, or half salad half rice. Add your fish, your veggies and toppings, and you have an Ahipoki Bowl. If you haven't found this gem yet, go now you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow! Place is packed but worth the wait! The food was perfect and the service was very impressive. Riggs went out of his way to teach my wife and I the menu and he was patient, enthusiastic and friendly.  Hire more of him!"}
{"text":"Like a beautiful \"Chipotle style\" flow-through and pick your palate kind of Restaurant... BUT for sushi lovers!!!  Ahipoki offers the most delicious bowls. We ordered the Large and shared, we picked 3:  -Spicy Tuna -Tuna Luau -Kimchi Shrimp  With a half and half base of Brown Rice & Salad. Topped with \"Garlic Soy Mirin.\" We added avocado and every topping they had to offer. I'm not even finished with my bowl and I cannot wait to go back!! So very fresh and full of the best flavors. The management and staff were kind and on point. Nothing too spicy, but delectable!!  I wish I could put 10 stars $15 with drink and enough for 2."}
{"text":"I love ahipoke bowl and the concept! I had only been to Scottsdale location and they rock!  Recently decided to try Chandler location seeing that both are equally as far for me. I had a bad a experience with Kevin M.he was rude and needs to be retrained.When I asked a question ..he seemed annoyed and not answer but point to menu.We also had a free coupon and was in no way trained on how to handle this transaction.He called his manger who took care of us. I recommend this trying Ahipoke but not this location."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the meal. Thought the prices were good for what we received. Staff was nice enough. Definitely has a fast food feel.   All in all, far from blown away though. I would have went with 4 stars, but the music is so loud and obnoxious. It felt like we were at a rave!  I woulda brought glow sticks with me if I had any idea. I hate that kind of music. We actually ate faster so that we could escape it."}
{"text":"I have been to this particular Ahipoki location twice and both times the fish tasted fresh and the service was good.  I like to get brown rice with octopus and tuna, house sauce, cukes, edamame, avocado, crab salad, and sesame seeds.  That is my personal preference, but my husband also agrees that the fish he has gotten also tastes fresh."}
{"text":"This place is great!! It is about time there was good Poke in AZ. The customizable style makes it even better! So happy about this place!!!"}
{"text":"Have eaten at several other similar Poke restaurants in the Phoenix area and this one is my favorite. The way they season their sushi is superior, the freshness and flavor is amazing. They don't skimp on ingredients when you say you want all the toppings either."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with AhiPoki. I usually go to the Scottsdale location because it was the only location I knew of.. but found this location today to my pleasant surprise. The employees at the Chandler location were much nicer than the Scottsdale location. The employees were kind, friendly, offered to accommodate my extra rice request by offering to put it in an extra box to fit more food, they never rolled their eyes like the Scottsdale employees do (every time) and worked very quickly and efficiently. I am so happy I'm here and the food is amazing of course! So much flavor and freshness."}
{"text":"Not a big poki fan but my husband loves this place so I figured I'd give it a try. Must say it was pretty decent but expensive for the portion that you get"}
{"text":"Great selection for your bowls! Food is fresh and also very customizable for your macros/cals intake. My daughter loves the ice cream macaroons !"}
{"text":"Such a new concept and idea. My guy took me here and it was amazing! It was so fun! I never would have dreamed the combinations that they give work but they were so good. The raw fish was outstanding! The crab salad was sooooo good. I can never eat crab salad anywhere else! Will eat here again! Felt full but not gross full after, healthy full. And had a whole other meal the next day! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It's okay, but nothing spectacular. The quality of the fish was acceptable for poki, but I wouldn't come back if were for sashimi. The music in the store was kinda irritating so it was take out for me the next time. Does offer extra scoops for a reasonable price add."}
{"text":"Amazing! Recently opened, the staff was very nice, and the food was excellent. I got the half and half bowl of rice and salad with tuna and the kimchi sauce. Also get the iced green tea, it's so good! The only downside we encountered was that they do not have the unagi sauce, that would be a great addition."}
{"text":"I'm a little ashamed to admit that this location opened three days ago and I've already eaten here twice. I've been to the Ahwatukee and Scottsdale locations, and this may be the nicest out of all of them! There was a line almost out the front door at lunch today, but they employees were all super friendly and helpful and kept everything moving quickly. I got the half and half (brown rice and salad) with amazing salmon and luau tuna, and all the other toppings. It ended up a huge serving of food, and I ended up with leftovers to take home. My aunt does not eat anything raw, but she loved the spicy shrimp and octopus in her rice bowl. Multiple people stopped by our table to check on us, which was definitely appreciated. I didn't get a chance to try the macaron ice cream sandwiches today, but I'd also highly recommend those. I'm so happy that there's finally an Ahipoki close to home, and I'll definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"I got the information of Ahipoki Bowl from a friend that added in yelp. The dishes was fresh and delicious, the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Such a simple yet wonderful concept that I will keep this one short.  If you are a sushi or Poke fiend like myself you will love this place.  The fish they use is pretty good and the flavors are spot on.  I will now need to add this place to my list of foods I crave and it is a perfect hot weather meal.  Keeps you feeling light on the toes and healthy.    Just beware the lines which can be out the door.  Going at slightly off times will help for sure.  Great staff, nice and clean restaurant, and good value for what you get.    Hard surfaces everywhere and busy busy keep it loud and their drink selection is somewhat limited.  Fountain drinks with Poke?  Not for me.  They need to add some good drinks like better teas, Japanese beers, and Kombucha and I think this place drifts toward the 5 star mark."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first visit yesterday. It is a great, convenient location in Chandler and I'm hoping to find my perfect combination of ingredients! So far I loved the combo of: bed of spring mix topped with tuna, salmon, octopus with the Garlic Soy Mirin w a slash of Spicy Creamy and red onions, seaweed, sesame seeds and crunchy onions! I'm salivating remembering it just now!  Also, I'm bummed to read reviews that their portions on fish are small.. Well i got the large (3 scoops) and so did my husband and we both barely finished ours, it was quite filling! Also, the fish tastes fine, no chewiness, no fishiness... I had zero complaints on portion and flavor."}
{"text":"Awesome selection of raw fish and sauces to make poke just the way you like it. It's kind of like Chipotle for poke! Options include brown rice, half salad & half rice, and seaweed among others.  It's fresh, reasonably priced, and delicious! Try it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. I order white rice, two scoops of salmon, spicy house sauce, masago, 3 scoops of edamame, and crab mix. So fresh and delicious. The large bowl is pretty big and I typically share that with my husband and we go there at least once a week."}
{"text":"Amazing. ........! Fresh Fresh Fresh. A good friend of mine was in the area so we met up for lunch at this place since we've heard good things about it. It's a pretty simple set up! You'll stand in line and you pick out what you want to eat and there's a bunch of options and bunch of add-ons. No matter what you do you can't go wrong! Recommend to everybody. Please make sure to try"}
{"text":"If you like sushi, then you'd love poke. I've heard of poke and until someone recommended that I try it, I wasn't going out of my way to have it. Until last night when this location recently opened near my moms and work, I decided to go try it. I got a regular two scoop bowl of tuna and salmon, with white rice, ginger, cucumber, and sesame seeds with house sauce. Very delicious. Like sushi, it really filled me up, so two scoops is enough for one person. It was a bit understaffed as there were only two employees working, so it was a bit slow as the people ahead of me had large orders. But when I finally dug in, it was great. I'm taking a sushi loving date here next time I go. It is fish so I don't recommend someone who has a fish allergy to go here cause that's all the protein meats they have."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place many times and the bowls are always amazing! I went yesterday with my friend and instead of getting what I always get, I wanted to switch it up a little bit. The blonde girl that was helping me was so disrespectful and was basically rushing me. I then pointed to one of the sauces and asked her if it was good, and she just said \"sauces are up there\", and just pointed at the sign. I didn't ask what it was, I asked if it was good and that's all she said to me. And when I received my plastic container with the salad in it, it literally looked like the food was just thrown in there while I looked at my friends container with her salad and it was nicely made. I work in a restaurant so I understand that people may have bad days or can get frustrated, I've been there. But I've never experienced that by an employee when I've ordered food before. Safe to say I'm not coming back there. The food is amazing, but you need to teach your employee to be a little more respectful."}
{"text":"So I wanted to love this place. AZ's first real entrant into the poke craze that's hit California pretty hard the past few years. Been to the one in Scottsdale which was ok but didn't make me feel compelled to drive that distance again just for their poke. So I decided to check this chain out again in this new location in Chandler with a friend one night. I decided to get the \"organic salad\" base and the girl at the counter started filling my bowl when all of a sudden the manager took away the bowl from her and started putting a bunch of the salad back. Really? We're gonna be counting leaves here? So then I chose the 3 scoops - salmon, scallops, and yellowtail. The manager (or at least I assume she was based on the attitude she was projecting) then told me that it was a dollar extra for the yellowtail. Funny - didn't see that little detail on the menu - at least not the online menu. Whatever, I told her to go ahead with the yellowtail. Noticed those scoop spoons are pretty tiny. I prefer what they call \"Hawaiian style\" back in California and of course in Hawaii - which is just the fish and condiments with no rice or salad of any kind. Sure, it's more expensive but I'm willing to pay more for more quantity of poke. The best places I've been to as far as poke goes charge more than this place does but you get your poke fill to be sure - to the point where every burp makes you feel like you're by the ocean. That did not seem to be an option here. Poke itself isn't bad - just hoping there will be more competition in the local poke restaurant market soon. Probably would like this place much more if I wasn't such a poke whore and hadn't been around the poke block so much. Will probably be back because a friend of mine goes ape feces over this stuff even the way it's offered here. Location: it's in a free standing building right on the west side of 54th street just a little ways south of Ray. Same mall as Bed, Bath & Beyond and Toys R Us - not far from Jimmy John's. Lots of parking - if not right next to it just a short walk away as it's in a huge mall. I could swear this place was full of charizards - I was seeing them all over the place - either that or my friend was lying about any extra ingredients being in those brownies we had earlier. Your mileage in terms of both poke and pokemon may vary greatly."}
{"text":"The first time we tried Ahipoki was at this location. We were greeted immediately when we walked in by a kind and friendly girl. Being that it was our first time there, she took her time to explain the menu items and we really appreciated that. We ordered a salmon sashimi bowl. Let's just say, if I could eat it every day I would! They didn't have ponzu sauce, but their house sauce made me forget all about it! I'm glad poke bowls are becoming more popular in Arizona and I think it's because Ahipoki makes everyone love it!"}
{"text":"I am so happy they opened a location in Gilbert! The place is clean and the service was great. We didn't get the name of the lady who served us, but she was Vietnamese. She made the bowl the way we wanted it and it was perfect! She even recommended that we try the coffee flavored ice cream macaron because it was her favorite. Now, it's my favorite too!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh build your own sushi bowls. Very tasty! Highly recommend! You pick your base (brown rice, white rice, salad), your sushi (spicy tuna, salmon etc), sauce, and toppings. It's like Chipotle but for sushi bowls. Very fresh sushi (always important) and a great mix of ingredients you may add to make it your own."}
{"text":"My first poké bowl experience and it was delicious!! Think chipotle style ordering just with sushi grade fish and sushi style toppings. We ordered 50/50 rice and greens, tuna, and pretty much all the available toppings. Definitely recommend the garlic mirin spy sauce with a side of the spicy soy. Regular size is $9.50 and large $11.50. Regular size plenty of food for one person! Def will be back to try more combinations!!"}
{"text":"Since they deleted my question... thanks Yelp... here's my official review.   AhiPoki has always been a favorite of mine, their fresh food is fantastic, fish is quality, and add-ins nice. But for some reason this location can't get it together! I walked in last time, ordered food, staff was great, but then they told me \"We don't validate parking.\" Wait - this location is in cityscape, that's where I parked. They told me to go to CVS and get my ticket validated. So my $10 poke bowl now went up an additional $10 because CVS has minimums you have to hit to get validated. Fantastic.  Then, I go in on a Sunday Night. At 6:10pm. Reasonable time for someone to get get dinner. After looking at Google (claims they're open until 9) I pull on the door, nope. Closed. At 6. What kind of place that operates primarily as a lunch and dinner spot closes at 6?!   I'll be heading to Chula Seafood way over in Scottsdale - AhiPoke here has lost me."}
{"text":"So glad Ahipoki Bowl has made its way to Arizona for two locations now! I seriously love the options and whole concept. This particular one is newly constructed and staffed, so they have a bit of growing pains in terms of service and customer engagement. But, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"I was in the area so I decided to stop here for lunch. First of all the girls that were working were very rude and when I asked for a extra side of sauce she gave me a dirty look. The portions are terrible got a large half and half. I asked for shrimp and I got maybe 5 prices of shrimp also double tuna which I got maybe 8 pieces total.  Also very little sides. I am very disappointed with this location. I will just stick to the Scottsdale location where I usually go."}
{"text":"Food was good but staff are not very friendly. They look miserable! ... did not feel welcome at all.. plus they were charging too much.. probably not gonna come back here. There are better places with better serving portions."}
{"text":"Been to ahipoke three times now and looking forward to going again. Fresh and delicious raw tuna and salmon with brown rice and veggies is what I go for. They also have the best deal on Thai Tea in town, only $3."}
{"text":"Usually love this place, I come at least once or twice a week, however the last two times I have found things in my food. Last week I found a piece of plastic in my poke salad, yesterday I found a piece of paper."}
{"text":"This place is SO Ono!! So excited to have a poke place in Phoenix!!! Who would have evah thunk it?!!"}
{"text":"Sushi in a bowl. That's what it is in a nutshell. Friendly staff, fast service. Love this place! You can read the other good reviews to get a feeling of what you get!"}
{"text":"Comparable to the poki spots in san diego! I will definitely be back.  Hopefully there's a location closer to North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is terrific! I'm not a raw food eater, so I ate the shrimp and octopus. But the selection of toppings and sauces.... my gosh. I never really give 5 star reviews. But the atmosphere and decor plus the great prices and food. MY NEW FAVORITE SPOT."}
{"text":"Extremely courteous and friendly. Always a treat to come in. Great food and the staff make me feel like old friends. My favorite location!"}
{"text":"Hmmm food is okay. Customer service on the other hand let's maybe treat all customers the same. Either cut corners with all customers or just be slim with all. Yes, it's for here, no that doesn't complete my order, and yes I'd like a receipt!!!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty. I had the Tuna Luau and Salmon bowl with half and half (salad mix and brown rice), with house sauce and all the toppings.  I wish it was a tiny bit bigger. For the price of $9.50 I would kind of like more fish. Like maybe if the scoop sizes for the fish were bigger. I'm still hungry but satisfied. I'll return."}
{"text":"Amazing food Definitely need to try it again food was phenomenal Perfect and authentic"}
{"text":"This is the first Poke place I've been to, so I don't have much to compare it to, but this is one of my favorite places around. I've made the 40 minute drive twice now just to come here. So fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the young man behind the counter didn't know how to handle a crowd... Which, by the way was four people.  He tried to have an assembly line work only one worker... First he have us the base, them he asked the other two parties what they wanted... He then came back to our fish, then asked the other two parties what they wanted.  Finally I told him that we had theater tickets and he needs to finish one order before he starts the next....I guess he thought this was efficient.... NOT."}
{"text":"We LOVE the food here but the employees are why I am giving 3 stars.  They are probably the most unenthusiastic bunch I have seen in a while.  Never a 'hello' or smile.  They should really be more welcoming to their customers because this place is pretty busy and trendy right now.  We drive out of our way to come here only to be greeted with FROWNS that stare at you speechless until you break the ice and tell them what you want.  I actually waited this time for them to say something to me first and it didn't happen. LoL. I can't imagine how a brand new customer would feel.  Needless to say, we are definitely looking forward to their new Tempe location to open."}
{"text":"This place is dope.  They hooked me up with a fat bowl, three scoops fish and drink for like 14 bucks!  How can you go wrong.  It may not be Hawaii but for AZ you can't go wrong here on a hot day!  And the avocado makes the bowl - pay the extra buck and get it."}
{"text":"I love this place! The seafood is always unbelievably fresh and they have different specials each month (blazing salmon will burn your mouth it's so hot but amazing!!) and they load up your boxes with a lot of ingredients so it's well worth the $12 price for a large. You can't go wrong with your selections.   I usually get the spicy tuna, salmon, and ahi tuna with half brown rice and half greens. I love the hot spicy and hot creamy sauces mixed and to top it off I get the cucumbers, seaweed salad, edamame, and fried onions.   Highly recommend and always come back to these restaurants."}
{"text":"A great place to get healthy food!  I love the Luau Tuna with a mix of rice and salad, I get almost ALL of the toppings offered including avocado, except onions! The regular size includes 2 scoops of your choice of fish, adding the rice and salad plus toppings makes for a filling meal for me at least!  I know some folks get the large 3 scoop. I cant even imagine finishing one of those!  They also offer a fantastic iced matcha green tea that I can't get enough of."}
{"text":"Soooo going to a lot of Poki joint in the valley, this by far isn't that great. I went to Scottsdale and the service and food was amazing. I hope this finds as constructive criticism rather then just tattle telling. When t comes to food, especially raw food....food care and presentation is very important.   The worker serving and prepping was very hesitant. At some points I was telling him how to do it. When mixing Ahi, I'm sure you mix with your hands to not poke the fish and penetrate the flesh. This dude literally got a fork and started stabbing st it.   I know they just opened, and therefore I'm grateful they got something out here in the valley. They Gatta work out the kinks and some of the attitude. I'm giving 3 because the food at least taste decent. I'm sure 5 stars will be in the future. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"I loved this place when it opened.  They were generous with the fish, the edamame, pickled radish, just about everything was a generous portion,  and they were on top of it! However,  after a couple months now, I eat there twice a week, they've lost that friendly vibe and  they use these tiny scoopers, that seriously dish out maybe 5-6 cubes of fish.  I've said something now to them twice, hoping they'd catch my subtle hint, not wanting to full on complain, and they don't care.  I will be trying another place, further away, that I heard is still generous and costs just the same. I will admit, the food is good."}
{"text":"Love this place.  You can get your poki bowl the  way you like it with whatever you want.  Everything was very fresh and the best part  was the sashimi. Open one in Tucson!"}
{"text":"I dream of ahipoki bowl weekly.  After moving to California, believe it or not... I haven't found a poke place that can out do the price or the quality of ahipoki bowl.  The serving sizes are pretty huge.  The large size can feed a small army.  I feel full throughout my day just eating half.  The topping options are all so fresh & accompany the bowls perfectly.  My city really needs to step up it's poke game because a little spot in the desert shouldn't be this good but it is."}
{"text":"Remember when the only place to eat poke was @ahipokibowl?! It's still one of my favorites cause of the wide variety of toppings they offer. The only thing is that the servings are much smaller than most poke places in AZ. It's perfect for me though cause I can't eat that much in one sitting? Anyway, if you haven't already tried it, you should come in!"}
{"text":"Looking for a light, healthy and quick meal that actually tastes good, Ahipoki Bowl is the place to go!  Decide how you're going to power up your appetite by choosing your bowl, 2 scoops or 3!  Start your taste buds on an adventure beginning with your choice of brown rice, white rice, organic salad or a half and half mix. For a little extra bonus of flavor avocado and onion are available, but you won't catch them in my bowl.  Choose your main player, a variety of fish, tuna, spicy tuna(my favorite in case you were wondering), luau tuna, albacore, salmon, octopus for the brave, yellow tail, scallops, shrimp, kimchi shrimp, bubba gump shrimp.... Oh wait cross out that last one I got carried away!  On to the sauces, get a squirtle of house sauce, house spicy, spicy creamy (my favorite in case you were still wondering) sweet citrus, garlic soy, wasabi citrus and kimchi sauce.  Load up with the toppings, crab meat which is practically like getting another scoop for free(but don't tell them that) masago, edamame, cucumber, seaweed salad, radish, daikon sprouts, and wasabi. Make certain the wasabi gets thoroughly mixed in because if you catch a ball of that you will feel like your mouth captured a Charmander!  Finish it all off with some chili flakes, roasted seaweed, or with their seasoned sesame seed mix.  I've never been one to love fish but since trying Ahipoki Bowl my taste buds have evolved. So many combinations to choose from, you gotta try them all!"}
{"text":"Tyson just made me the best bowl I've ever had. Had to bring one back to my office for one of my staff members who hadn't had lunch yet. This place is fantastic. I will be here at least three times a week."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is fresh and amazing. Ask for Drew! He will make your day...service is some of the best in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Well the party is over. Smaller portions and crabby servers.  Plus the salad wasn't great. Wilted lettuce. Yuck. Not going back."}
{"text":"Little update on my review!!  Went back there recently , was pleasantly surprised! New team, new attitude and SMILE!!! Great job.   I'll be back to this location again!!"}
{"text":"I typically come during lunch time and the line is super long, but it actually moves quick. The place is always clean, and the staff is super friendly and helpful. I usually get the regular size salad but it is filling with the 2 choices of seafood and the variety of toppings!"}
{"text":"Food is alright but the service is TERRIBLE. I understand they just opened but I don't think I will ever spend a dime here. You get a free attitude from the staff with every poki bowl you purchase."}
{"text":"Ahipoki bowl is one of the first poke places here in the East Valley. The chain is growing popularity with its variety of raw fishes from salmon to octopus. Ahipoki serves large portions catering to a heathy fast-food clientele. They are slowly going down hill so continue to try them out before they lessen portions, and provide terrible service."}
{"text":"Excellent and fresh poke. Lots of choices. Really liked the Tuna Luau - most authentic poke.  Can see this place getting a long line at lunch."}
{"text":"Great sushi grade fish.   Well portioned.  Clean and friendly staff.   Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I have had in a long time. The sushi bowl is a Great concept. The ingredients are fresh and so many items to choose from. My only suggestion is for the staff to be friendlier. I ate lunch at the Scottsdale location last week and took my family to the chandler location for dinner tonight and both places had the same vibe from the staff. I will continue to eat here however."}
{"text":"My squeals of happiness must have been heard all over the East Valley when the Chandler location opened. I had discovered Ahipoke Bowl a few months ago and was driving to Scottsdale 1-2 times per week to get my Ahipoke fix. Now it's so much more convenient. Try the new kimchi sauce. So good."}
{"text":"Everything I ordered here was super fresh - the mixed greens, the tuna, the salmon, the toppings. You get a decent amount of food with endless possible variations, the whole meal is relatively inexpensive for the quality and quantity you get, and the staff is very friendly. The dining area is large because there is a seating portion at the back which may not be immediately visible when you come in, and parking is available both in front of and behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"The place is new, clean and seems to me to a pretty good start. I visited late night so the guys were out cleaning and not all of the choices were out for display. I added all the perfect ingredients to make my bowl spicy but no luck. The rice was warm and my salmon was cool, the food was pretty alright. My only complaint is that it was a little smaller than what you could get at some other poke places for just about the same price."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is fantastic if you're a sushi fan!  When I walked up to the counter, all I could think was, \"I want to eat all the things!\"  Love how you can pick from all of the different toppings and that they will let you try things before selecting them. Great place and I can't wait to go back. I wish they'd open one in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"When you first see the portion size you think \"what is this? A meal for dolls?\" But the portion size is perfect and the house sauce is delicious!  It tasted fresh, which will bring me back time and time again!"}
{"text":"My first experience with a poke spot was at the Ahipoki location in Scottsdale. While I really enjoyed it when it was the only game in town, other places have come along and seem to be a better value. The poke bowl was very good, but with all of the up-charges it's hard to justify paying so much more when I can get the same quality at a lower price at other places. It's an extra $1 for teeny thimble sized scoop of masago, an extra $1 for krab, and extra $1.50 for avocado, the bowl ends up being around $13-$15 with all of the add-ons. The place that I usually frequent does not charge extra for masago, krab and avocado is $1 extra so the bowl is usually $10-$12 there. Why would I keep coming here if I can get the same thing for less elsewhere?"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for a poke place in the mainland. Being in Arizona for almost a week, we were definitely craving some sashimi or poke and luckily saw this restaurant while shopping in the nearby area. Menu is pretty straightforward and reasonably priced. I mean, it's definitely not like poke or fresh at home, but still pretty tasty. And you do have a variety of options to choose from -- ahi tuna, spicy tuna, yellowtail/hamachi, even scallops or shrimp. And many more toppings as well.  I ordered a large poke bowl with white rice (brown is also available) with yellowtail and regular ahi. You can mix it with choice of specialty sauce - I got the garlic soy mirin and I absolutely loved it! Toppings I choose were -- crab salad, masago, sesame seeds, and green onions.  I devoured through the whole bowl because we were just really craving that raw fish. You can also buy some ice cream macarons, iced green tea, or iced Thai teas. Some really great options available!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place- please bring one to Chicago!  I was in town visiting for a conference and went here 2 days in a row :)  The sushi was fresh, as were the toppings, and the customer service was outstanding! I will be back when I am in town again!"}
{"text":"We were looking for something more than lunch but less than dinner and without a long wait. This was perfect! The food was fresh and delicious with many choices to build our bowls. Nice healthy choices, so much better than a run of the mill fast food place. If we had these where I live I would certainly visit it."}
{"text":"I love this place, especially the one in Scottsdale. However, today was different than the other times I've been here! First, I've had poke from other places, like Hawaii for instance, focuses on their fish rather than the \"fillers\". But hey, we're in Az. This is pretty good for what it is. Today, I ordered the regular with two scoops of protein. Honestly, it was more half a scoop each... Ahi Poke, you've trained workers to be mighty stingy with the meat and it's not a good thing. I had like 4 pieces of salmon and I was pretty disappointed. Next, their \"unlimited fillers\" are max of 2 scoops, otherwise, it's 75 cents each after. I mean, I wouldn't mind it if your regular bowl ranged 6-8 dollars but it's 10 or more. Guys, I love food but if it's that expensive then idk, there's Chipotle next door for that desired price range."}
{"text":"Wow. Choose your fresh ingredients to create a healthy and delish dish. Easily the best salad I've ever had. Kind folks behind the bar.  Please build one of these in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I am so glad this is now nearby. Staff is friendly. Portions are generous. Food is seriously delicious. It's a little hard to believe they can serve this quality food at this price point. Can't wait to have this meal on a regular basis."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and food was great as always! Went there for a lunch, saying bye to some co workers and the cashier took a picture of us when we asked without hesitation!!"}
{"text":"Fish is fresh and so are the fixings.  Much more inexpensive than what you could get in the islands. A large poke bowl with three scoops of poke (including the upgraded hamachi fish (yellow tail tuna)) was under $12! totally worth it and so delicious too! We chose the house spicy sauce and it wasn't that spicy but still very yummy."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, healthy and fast, with plenty of ingredients to try! Hubby enjoys the cooked shrimp, while I love mixing up the various raw options, trying something new each visit!"}
{"text":"I love the ahipoki bowl concept. Think of fresh salmon and tuna, mixed with organic greens, avocado, masago, seaweed salad, edamame, sesame seeds, crab salad and house dressings, it is heaven!   I have been here 3 times in 3 weeks, food are consistent and the stuffs are friendly.  Thai iced tea is good too."}
{"text":"Damn what can I say about this place that hasn't already been said, awesome food, this my new lunch place, if you're one of those people like me that says salad is for rabbits, this place will change your mind!  Damn first time in a long time that I haven't wanted to take a nap after lunch, and josh the guy that runs the show is A+, could not ask for more, awesome place!  Thanks again!  Troy"}
{"text":"Been going to this place so many times, great place for everytime I'm hungry but this time I'm very disappointed!!!! It doesn't taste great anymore, I have to chew some sand with the food and I can't even eat the fish. I also ask for the onion fried and it not even in my meal."}
{"text":"Ahipoki Bowl is like the Chipotle of sushi bowls. Build your own delicious creation. The ingredients taste fresh and the fish is so very good.   I am so excited to have a new place to eat in Chandler. I work down the street and I've been dying for a new healthy option. Here it is!  Now all they need to do is start serving Sushirittos and I may never leave."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! You don't see many healthy options on the go. The food is always fresh and they have options for almost everyone. Definitely my new favorite on the go restaurant!"}
{"text":"This really my cut on god I be here 3-4 times a week. Spectacular variety of sauce in which I got lost in. I really wish this establishment would play some classic music, the edm blasting into ear canal is causing me to hemorrhage. Thank you ahipoke."}
{"text":"Finally they opened their location in Chandler!  I've been an avid fan of the Scottsdale location and I'm extremely excited that one is near me.  I love the layout of the restaurant, as it has a clear marking for a waiting line that is sectioned off.  The interior design is beautiful and looks like a very expensive modernized home kitchen. The staff during opening weekend was very friendly and generous with their portion sizes.  I came in twice during opening weekend!  (Obsessed much?  I think so!)  I was a bit shocked at how much fish I was getting with every heaping spoonful.  I have a feeling that will change as time goes on and they start cutting costs.  But I could be wrong!  Gotta enjoy the poke as much as I can  regardless! Their fish is extremely fresh and I love how their sauces compliment with your bowls.  I have an obsession with their House Spicy sauce.  I even went about to ask about purchasing a bottle, but unfortunately was told that they don't sell it.  However, one of the employees told me all the ingredients in it, so I'm going to have to find a time one day and play around with the portions to get the right recipe. I will definitely become a weekly regular here.  Let's just hope it doesn't hurt my wallet too much!"}
{"text":"Healthy sushi with a different flare. Good amount of serving in the large two item bowel. The restaurant still had a fast-food atmosphere like several chain burger places. There were too many people talking to me at once as if they were trying to herd us through the line - not my style. Friendly."}
{"text":"Definitely overpriced for the size of the poke bowls. I can understand there aren't many poke bowl places in Arizona, but I don't see how they charge $10 and not include avocados in the price. Back home in Dallas, there's only one poke bowl establishment, so supply and demand would dictate that the price be well above $10. Well that place only charges $8, all toppings are included, and they're about double the size of the ones here.   The employees were a bit rude and the quality of the food was nothing spectacular either. I expected the poke to be marinated in something, but it is plain and the lackluster toppings do nothing to help."}
{"text":"Always loved the Thomas and Scottsdale location. Just opened this one near our house. Figured we'd get some poke impromptu. Checked the hours on the website. 9pm close. Get here at 5 min to close. Doors are locked and staff is inside fully ready to go. Don't get me wrong. We knew that it would be last minute and that the fish wouldn't be the freshest, but we also would expect the doors would remain open until at least the POSTED time on the doors and website. We drove all the way here specifically because of the great food but after this horrible waste of time? I'm not so sure."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, this place has great poki bowls! But the last 2 times I've come in, they have become so skimpy on the servings that it's not worth the cost. I'll take my business and $ to the other Ray Rd- Pokitrition"}
{"text":"After spending the last week in Hawaii I was excited to stumble on AhiPoki Bowl and let me tell you something, their food was legit! It was every bit as good as the Poke' I experienced in Hawaii and was actually less expensive! Do yourself a favor and make your way to APB, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times. The fish is always fresh and the service friendly. I could eat here every day but it is 30 minutes from my home. Hope they bring one to Gilbert soon, tired of all the chain restaurants and soup, salad and sandwich places. We need something to wake up the taste buds, like delicious Ahi Poke bowls. If you have never tried Poke and you like sushi, particularly sashimi, then you will enjoy a taste of Hawaii in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty food!  A bit on the pricy side but very good. Try the green tea & tropical drink mixed together."}
{"text":"Have been reading about this place on YELP as it is constantly getting reviewed.  Well guess what?!?!  It lives up to the hype.  It may seem pricey to pay $10 for a regular bowl but compared to going out for sushi, its a respectable alternative.  The selections are super fresh and delicious!  Found my new healthy lunch spot for sure.  No where else you can get a meal like this.  Think of it as the CHIPOTLE OF POKE!"}
{"text":"Love this place, I am glad more are \"popping up\" because this makes eating healthy much easier for me. I love the fresh food and clean restaurant.  This location is close to my work and I am so glad.  It seems to be easy to access parking and friendly staff. They have televisions and nice big windows. The food is super healthy and fresh and they have awesome toppings and quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Every thing that I dreamt of in a Sushi Sashimi environment!! I recommend larger plates!!! But love the sauces and the texture I truly amazing!!! The Salmon and the spicy tuna are very tasty and fresh!! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I stopped in here to grab a poke bowl it was my first time here. They greeted me at the counter and the guy was so helpful in explaining to me how it worked. I got half brown rice and half salad, yellow fin tuna and spicy tuna, I got everything light on the onion and the guy was so nice and helpful he let me taste the sauces and suggested mixing creamy spicy with the house sauce and yummy!! If you like raw fish and freshness I would say drop in and try it. It didn't disappoint me... happy Eats! :)"}
{"text":"It was a good place to go. A little pricey for the amount of food, the house sauce is too salty. Not really a fan of the Tuna Luau but the salmon was good"}
{"text":"First time trying this place tonight, I loved it! They have lots of different options and staff was friendly and patient with me while I tried to figure out what I wanted. Everything looked clean and tasted very fresh which is always nice to see especially with raw fish. Can't wait to go back and try more combinations!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting for a place like this on the West side!!  Fast and healthy!  The staff is excellent- the restaurant is clean- and the food was fantastic! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Service is fast and food is great. If you like sushi you need to give it a try."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!  Super fresh.  High quality and exceptional taste.  I can't wait to come back!  This was my first time ever and I am already hooked.  The fish was so bright and fresh.  The sauces were delectable.  The greens were crisp and fresh.  This was a great experience having a healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Refreshing crazy flavors for a chill place in the Southwest. Three scoop with salad, squid, ahi, spicy salmon,pickled radish, seaweed salad, and crab. Not cheap, but not expensive. $$"}
{"text":"Love love love Ahipoki. Im from Cali and have been searching for a good Poki spot. FOUND IT!!!!! Awesome house spicy sauce and if you mix the green tea w/ the Thai tea its delish..."}
{"text":"Three stars only because of the food. Service is the reason for the low rating. Arrived at the beginning of the lunch rush. Employees greet you quickly with a sense of \"hurry-up\" I have other orders to take & rush you through with your choices. News Flash-it was the lunch rush & we all know that it will be busy!! Hey let's take a moment to make the food look appealing instead of just throwing it on top of the rice or salad. A few of the employees were more interested in gossiping then listening the choices the customers were making. Enough about the service. Poki choices were great, although some didn't look as fresh as others& unfortunately didn't taste fresh either-the scallop that was added to the salad. It's great to be able to choose what you want to add for the sauces (all flavorful) & toppings. A suggestion-the employees should know how to name the toppings instead of just pointing to it & asking this one or that especially when I know told them which ones I wanted. A manager type person was visible to me but seemed flustered at times. Cashier was very nice & only friendly person. Hopefully service will get better in time since it just opened."}
{"text":"Great service. People were easy to talk with, knowledge and they answered my questions. Line was short and quick. Previous reviews on Yelp have great food recommendations. Seating and areas were clean. Limited drink options and food was great.   4 not 5 really just based what wasn't there not what was (above) Felt like a little sterile environment (like fast food place) with limited personality. But then again I might have done the same as a scaling business owner. And that feeling is subjective. Just felt like something was missing."}
{"text":"The food was really good and they gave a good amount of fish! They were all super friendly and gave me extra salad. I'd say the price was pretty fair considering how much food they gave us!! I like this location a lot better than the other ones I've been to."}
{"text":"This place is so great!!  You can basically get $40 worth of sushi grade fish for about $12.  I go there about 3 times a week.  The staff is always quick and generous.  Don't be afraid of a long line either.  They move you through at a supersonic pace."}
{"text":"Ah finally, a poki place in Arizona. Service was quite stellar. However, the quality of the fish and food were so-so. The spicy tuna was not spicy, it was just...tuna. The salmon had a fishy taste and rubbery texture, a sign that it was not fresh. The sauce was so-so, very salty as I had to eat a lot of my salad to wash down the taste. The taste overall does not blend well together. I don't know if its because of the lack of flavoring that each component that was in my bowl was missing...But I didn't get that wow factor from it.  Honestly, for the amount paid, I would not return to this place for a second chance."}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service. We ordered to go bowls one time and they forgot our fish. We hadn't noticed because we had dropped our bowls off and gone to the gym. Mike ( I believe that's his name) gave me a call and let me know right away of what had happened. He then offered us free bowls on our next visit. That to me was amazing customer service given the fact that he could have chosen not to call. Went back and got our free bowls today! Love this place. Great people. Great food. We did the salmon and the kimchi shrimp. Always fresh and always delicious! Thanks ahí poki! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love the concept and the food.  However there are a few things that should be addressed.  The scoops need to be a bit bigger as they are a bit small.  Also the staff and preparations need a bit of work as you never really know what you are going to get.  I will be back soon, so hopefully some of the opening funk will have worn off."}
{"text":"Awesome place and food is delicious. Love how you can pick what you want. The place is clean. The only reason they aren't getting 5 stars is because the staff could be a little more friendly. Been there about 4 times and have gotten the same experience from most of them. I keep going back because the food is that good."}
{"text":"Yum! My first time here, to this chain. Service was friendly and helpful. Food is amazing!  Love the variety of fresh seafood and other ingredients. This has become my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with this place. Today though I was disappointed with the girl who was serving me because I ordered a large salad and the amount of lettuce she put in barely filled the plastic container. I double checked with her to make sure it was a large size and she said yes and just kept going until she saw my face and then she says to me \" do you want more lettuce or something?\" It was definitely a little snippy but I took her up on it and it tasted delicious."}
{"text":"My family loved this place. Super fresh seafood, quality ingredients, delicious sauces, fast service, friendly employees. It's more expensive than fast food, but it's a good price for what you get. If you're in the mood to go someplace for a quick bite that has a customizable sushi feel, I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great food, clean inviting atmosphere.  This place was excellent and the staff was friendly.  Ive never been to a poki bar before this trip to Phoenix, thus was actually the second one ive been to in the past week.  They were both good, and each had its own lil nuances.  This one had Thai Tea out of a machine that was excellent, the food was very fresh."}
{"text":"Very tasty poke place. They have great sauces and good quality fish with a ton of options for toppings.  The service has always been good as well. At lunch time this place can get a very long line so be prepared to wait based on the time of day."}
{"text":"Great fresh ingredients, generous portions of meat, my only complaint is on the toppings. I was trying to get heavy toppings, even offered to pay yet I was ignored. The food is excellent though, just need a little work on the service."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness I have never eaten here before today. Let me just saw \"I'M IN LOVE\" oh my goodness so delicious! So scrumptious! So perfect! So healthy!!! Every single bite is an explosion of flavor in my mouth! I could eat here every single day!!! Wow!"}
{"text":"I love this place because it's fast and convenient without ever hurting the quality! I love that you can pretty much customize it to however you want it and the fish always taste fresh! I also like mixing the different sauces and trying new combinations :)"}
{"text":"I ate at Ahipoki before at their location on scottsdale and Thomas and I really enjoyed it. I had not had a chance to be back for a while and was so stoked to find out that they opened this new location and it's really close to where I live. So I decided to come here for lunch and boy! I was disappointed. The portion is definitely smaller, the price is definitely more expensive and they upcharge every single item possible. I just hate it when business starts to take off and they do this. There are so many places to get Poke now in the Valley so I will be taking my business elsewhere. I won't be back here, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Tuna was literally frozen when I bit into it. Absolutely horrible. Employee working was also not too friendly. Will not come back, I suggest you don't try it."}
{"text":"I saw a post in Ocotillo and friends about this new Poke place opening up. We live a good 20 minutes away from I-10 and Ray but we were in the neighborhood while shopping at the outlet mall. We stopped in at 5pm on a Saturday night. Got the large bowl with the tuna luau. Absolutely amazing. I had brown rice. Tuna luau, spicy tuna, seaweed, and edamame. Couldn't be fresher and more delicious. If it were closer I'd be hitting it up instead of chipotle. Gotta have one in Gilbert. So fresh so healthy and so tasty. Great job."}
{"text":"Since I was in the area working during lunchtime I hit up Yelp and found Ahipoki. I love poke and have eaten a lot of it in So Cal and Hawaii so believe me when I say this place is really good! I had the ahi tuna bowl over brown rice with the house spicy sauce.  The fish was fresh and the sauce was just the right amount of flavor and spice for my taste.  The balance of portions within the bowl was excellent not too much of any one ingredient overpowered the mix   The ambience and decor is well done too.  Go here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I actually usually love ahipoke normally go to the location off Scottsdale. I just left the gym nearby decided to drop by this location and give it a try. The only problem which I feel is a huge problem is the guy light handed the scoops of fish. Hed pick a scoop then dump half of it out. Each scoop had 3 pieces of fish in it. All three scoops ended up being the size of one good one. Huge difference from the other 40+ times I've been there. As I'm paying for my 16$ bowl of rice I look over and the women is giving out real scoops of fish to the next customer. I won't be back. Keep your fish bro!"}
{"text":"This is a great fast casual healthy option for lunch or dinner. I have been here several times and love it.  You can get either a rice bowl or a salad if you choose. I usually get the large rice bowl (includes choice of 3 fish) with brown rice, avocado, salmon, tuna, yellowtail, house sauce, cucumber, sprouts, onion, edamame, and sesame seeds. The fish is always fresh - raw and top sushi grade. The fish and the vegis are always fresh, clean tasting,  and delicious!"}
{"text":"I love everything about it and it's something I crave at least once a week. Beyond happy that they put one in the West Valley! Everyone is always friendly. Pro tip: just ask for all of the toppings on your bowl"}
{"text":"I originally gave them a 1 star because I couldn't find a way to call them to inquire about my missing wallet. Their phone number leads to their marketing company that doesn't answer phone calls. It's annoying, but I should have rated them on the overall experience. Edited review:  Someone said they're overpriced. Fresh fish is expensive. I'm not sure I'd feel safe eating raw fish that's any cheaper than this.   I just got back from Hawaii, and had plenty of more expensive poke there. None of that was as good as the poke at Ahipoke Bowl. The fish was nothing special, but the sauce and toppings was what separated it from other poke I've had. The house spicy sauce is delicious. Add a dash of sweet citrus too. I live a half hour away, but work close by. There are so many food options nearby, but I eat here 3-4 times a week.  5 star for food. -1 star for not having a working phone service."}
{"text":"I love this place! I go literally almost every other day! I'm obsessed! Thinking about getting a gift card! Just so I make sure I have money just for this place!!! Food is amazing! No matter what you get!! Definitely will be back!    I usually get a large with white rice, avocados, red onions, tuna, shrimp, and salmon, with house sauce, edamame, cucumbers, chili flakes, and furikake!!"}
{"text":"Of all the \"Poki\" fast food places, this spot is sub par.  First, the choices/toppings are lacking. The Tuna is frozen (literally), it was partially frozen when I went to eat it!!   The fish lacks flavor as well. Moreover, the staff, young kids, are just disinterested in serving you as if they are doing you a favor. Ridiculous. So, I drive 3-4 miles away to go to other Poke( Poke Bar)for better quality and service. Too bad, I live close by too."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, portions are good, service is alright, and the portions are large. Over all its a decent place but nothing to write home about. Solid spot to grab a quick lunch from to bring back to the office"}
{"text":"Same great Ahipoki Bowls I'm used to, but closer to my house! Great! They want me to say more, but what more can I say!"}
{"text":"Love it! My daughter and I got the buy one get one free promotion! I'm so glad there is one in gilbert, I'll be visiting a lot! Hopefully we'll get one in Queen Creek!"}
{"text":"Ahipoki is better than Chipotle.  Hands down.   There! I said it, and I mean it.  Without a doubt my new favorite place around, It's healthy, fresh, light and satisfying.   Chipotle is kind of the only thing i can compare the vibe to, its similar in the \"service style\" but couldn't be more different quality and service wise.    There fish is super fresh and the sauce selection is awesome, i'm a spice fanatic and they deliver with the wasabi and creamy spicy sauce.   We need a location out towards the west valley, i think something like this would do really well in Litchfield park/Goodyear area.  If i have to drive out that way to get my fix, i'll totally continue to do so.   Well worth it."}
{"text":"I've tried Ahipoki Bowl twice now (chandler and scottsdale) and both times I have walked away feeling underwhelmed by it. I think a big part of it for me is that the flavors just aren't meeting with my expectations when I think poke. When I have tried to get those classic flavors I just haven't gotten them. I think it's due to a lack of marinade time on the fish. I have also come away with thinking the sauces just don't have any punch to them. The spicy ones lack a kick and the others lack depth of flavor. The mixing house spicy and spicy creamy kicks it up a notch.  While not surprising the fish quality here leaves something to be desired. It's not bad but it's more akin to supermarket quality than sushi restaurant. I think the spicy tuna actually showed this the most where it had that taste of tuna that was frozen and thawed out and lost the color and texture I'm used to.  I do like the fact that you get plenty of toppings and the build your own combo is a fun one for sushi. I also think the price is right for what it is."}
{"text":"Third time at this location.. fish portion keeps getting smaller and smaller! Don't get me wrong, the food is decent but the price isn't right especially when I barely get any fish! The rice was quite dry too.. not sure if the purposely do that. Long story short.. I'll stick with going to Scottsdale location for my poke craving. 3.5 star rating."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant so much I could eat here daily. The fish was obviously frozen prior to getting it in my bowl but everything I ate tasted so fresh and delicious. I have been to this location twice now and each visit was consistent with serving sizes and happy employees. I got the three scoop option each time and I couldn't finish my bowl either time so next time I will be getting the two scoop option. Its similar to Chipotle where you pick your protein, salad and/or rice, sauce and then your toppings. I love that the toppings are not charged by the amount you get. I literally ask for everything and it's the same price as getting nothing. I will be going back soon for my next poke fix!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh fast and good pricing always a favorite and a must try for healthier good food"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this restaurant on my way thru errands. Fate! I had just returned from Portland, OR where the most talked about restaurant was Poke Mon on Hawthorne Blvd., a high traffic street (restaurant galore). Sadly, I couldn't incorporate a trip there so I've been hankering for poke since..  I was loving the $8 price for the regular bowl with 2 scoops of fish + all the toppings listed. Wow, including seaweed, sesame seeds, crispy onions, edamame and jicama. Avocado extra. Since this was my first time, I needed to try the some of the marinated fish and dressings.  I chose the house dressing, tuna, octupus with half rice and half salad. I was bug eyed at the big portion of salad and rice. It's more filling than ordering sushi. This was like deconstructed sushi. I devoured it.  I've never been to their Scottsdale location, but so glad they found a Chandler location because I think that helps keep the price affordable.    Although I know fish is not always in great supply, I will savor every bite of every order from Ahipoki, Chandler..I feel clean eating here and not cleaned out....Telling everybody!"}
{"text":"I just ate lunch here. I thought it was really good! They gave me a couple of samples of the fish and shrimp to try, which I though was pretty cool, so I could make sure I like it before I bought it. My bowl way very tasty and the ingredients were all fresh. I was in and out quick. I would definitely go back. Every bite was delicious."}
{"text":"Nice place for a healthy meal  Tonight, we decided to add a little \"healthy\" to the night of gluttony, so we decided to grab a wuick bite to eat at Ahopoki Bowl.   Ahopoki has a \"chipotle\" like feel, meaning you walk along the line and tell them how you would like your bowl made. On this visit I went with the brown rice + tuna house sauce/spicy + all the toppings.   My bowl wasn't bad, I was pleasantly surprised. Ahopoki is a great alternative for a very tasty and healthy / lite meal."}
{"text":"There were 4 of us trying out this new poke restaurant.  One of us didn't like sashimi but they accommodated her making a nice salad which she enjoyed almost as much as our company:) As mentioned the portions are large and filling, did I mention filling?  All ingredients were super fresh, the star of the show, the fish tasted as good as I've had at any of the sushi restaurants around.  The place was fairly busy on a Wednesday evening at 6pm.  We had the iced green tea which I would give 3 stars, it was OK.  Their wasabi was fairly potent, great for cleaning out your sinuses!  Together we tried just about all the possible choices and everything was delectable.  Try ahipokibowl.com/chandler for their menu, etc. I think it can get boring after a few times as the menu is limited to their bowls.  Well worth the price for a filling bowl of salad, rice and seafood, I think you should give them a try.  They have a sister restaurant on Scottsdale Rd. immediately south of Thomas Rd."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I'll be back. Not amazing enough for 5 stars. My first visit there , I guess I felt they could have been just a bit more helpful explaining the ordering process."}
{"text":"The fish tastes fresh and I like all the options for the toppings! The Thai Tea was equally delicious.  Now my boyfriend and I have a new seafood spot we'll be visiting regularly that's also close to home!"}
{"text":"It was good but a bit pricey. If I need my sashimi fix, I would visit on occasion but that's about it. I'm not sure if there's a lot of MSG or if it's the salmon I got, but got way too sleepy after.   Ingenious idea of course just like chipotle so it's worth trying it for yourself. I liked their Thai tea.   Got a bowl with tuna luau the-marinated tuna and salmon with rice and avocado and for my toppings, I asked for everything: Ginger, masago, sesame seeds, sea weed, jicama, cucumbers. Their sauce, I went out their recommendation of mixed house spicy and creamy spicy? It was good.   I'll visit again for sure just not sure if I love it yet."}
{"text":"Great and tasty poke bowls for a healthy lunch!  Friendly staff and super clean place...  $8.99 a bowl is a good price for a good lunch spot!  Stop in for a healthy snack!"}
{"text":"Great quality sushi with good options.  Can add additional scoops of fish as well.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love heading to AhiPoki Bowl for a Great, Healthy meal.  All the fish offerings are always super fresh and high quality.  They have a lot of toppings to choose from and are also all fresh and delicious. So glad AhiPoki Bowl opened up near me!  I just had it for lunch and am already craving it again!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place: fast and friendly...always tasty! Weekday crew rocks.  Weekend crew is equally awesome. Two big screens to keep you nicely distracted Clean bathrooms  If you come during the week, the place is jumping and you might have to wait 5 or so minutes for a table...but it's totally worth it.  I'm here on a Saturday before the evening rush and it's perfect: plenty of tables and the music isn't too loud.  Absolutely will come again and suggest anybody reading this tries this spot!!"}
{"text":"I was impressed, I had lunch at this place going into it worried that it might be too much or gross me out because it's technically sushi in a bowl but it wasn't too much or over powering all the ingredients mixed well and didn't feel like too much at all. I got the half salad and rice bowl! So good! I recommend anyone who loves sushi to try this at least once!"}
{"text":"First time at Ahi Poke...Drew and his staff were awesome. Showed me the ropes with extreme patience. Every thing was fresh and delicious. Outstanding customer service! Thanks guys, I'll be back"}
{"text":"My second visit ahipoke was better than the first. This location is new, clean and inviting. Drew and his crew are friendly, helpful and top notch!"}
{"text":"I never take pictures of meals - but I did this time. Not only did it look beautiful, but it was one of the most delicious and delightful meals I've ever had, in 62 years. An amazing array of options, generous portions, great price. The staff, two very sweet girls, were cheerful, kind helpful and knowledgeable. Telling all my Arizona or going-through-Arizona friends about this one, and my husband and I hope to be back again soon! This is a wonderful way to introduce someone new, to poke."}
{"text":"My friends and I all had great bowls here! I've recently moved back to Arizona from California so I was nervous it wouldn't be up to standard. The fish here is really great! It's as good as the best sushi restaurants in Phoenix. I love all the toppings here."}
{"text":"Poke meets Chipotle.  Neat concept: you go through the line and choose your rice, fish, and toppings (having maguro available is a nice touch). Unfortunately, the fish quality is marginal at best and because the sauce doesn't meet fish until you order it, you don't get any of the marinade effect you expect from a good poke. And lastly, it's ridiculously expensive for a little scoop of fish.  Glad I tried it; won't be repeating."}
{"text":"The first time I ate poke  bowl from them my gf brought it home to me because she knows it's my favorite. Well when I got to my bowl  it felt like half of my bowl was missing and they were very frugal with toppings and proteins.  My second visit was last night... They close at 9 and I arrived 5 minutes before closing so I felt bad. The girl up front told me not to worry because they are still opened. She was super friendly and she met my full expectations of what my bowl should actually look like.  Not too sure what happened the first time, but if it would have not been for the second time. I was treated so well and my bowl was full they would have had 2 stars. I'll keep going back and maybe they will go to 5 it is my favorite..."}
{"text":"Love love loovvee the array of selection for a poke bowl. Food has always been fresh every time. Only thing I'd like to see improvement in is the wait time. Understaffed maybe? Still great place to eat and will be back in the future."}
{"text":"1st timers and loved it. Easy to order, fresh and super tasty. Wife and I split a large bowl for lunch, but would come back again to do one ea for a dinner- good value. Don't let the servers push you through if you're new here - ask and they will accommodate!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. We need one in Tucson. If I could only eat one meal for the rest of my life it would be the salad with yellowtail, salmon, and tuna. I put basically everything on it. House spicy with a side of creamy spicy. DELISH."}
{"text":"I would so give this place 6 stars if there was an option to do so!!!! This is my third time here and it is still amazingly delicious. All the items are so fresh each time. Each time I go, I only order a regular size because that's all my stomach can handle. I would go for the larger one  because it's just that good. There are so many different items you can add on and lots of sauces to try out. My favorite is the spicy creamy. I get it so much that I haven't had the chance to try out the others. I get so full every time, but it's the healthy kind of full. I wish they had one in the Westside so that I can go here more often. Yes I'm that addicted to where I would drive from Goodyear to Chandler just to get my fish fix at Ahipoki bowl. The staff is quick at taking your orders and preparing them. So they will get your order done in no time at all. Also try their Thai tea it's the good as well!"}
{"text":"Really good and fresh. They have generous portions and a friendly staff. Best poke place in the valley in my opinion."}
{"text":"It's like dying and going to Poki bowl heaven. I could eat this stuff meal after meal.  I go to other locations but this one seems to have hr best staff. Very chatty and friendly and willing to accommodate anything I asked for.   I tell everyone to try this place because I can't get over how much flavor and the quality of ingredients they offer. If it's your first time, don't worry- the staff will walk you through everything and offer their suggestions.   I do cater from here as well and this has always been a great hit.   Can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I stopped in here on the way to grocery shop! I had a craving for something light but filling and Ahipoki Bowl was perfect. I ordered a large bowl with white rice, ahi tuna, garlic sauce, edamame, wasabi, masago, avocado, and a few other of their delicious toppings. Think Chipotle but for poke bowls! They had a ton of other protein options like yellowtail, octopus, salmon, and tuna luau and you also have the option to do brown rice, salad, or half and half. It was a little pricy at $17 something but I also got a green tea and the portions are decent. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Ahi Poki Continues to expand in Phoenix area and this CityScape is the newest location.  Since my first visit to their first one in Scottsdale, I signed up for their newsletter and received email from them about grand opening on Friday 8/25 with any bowls 50% off! Just happened to be the game night at the Chase field, I had to stop by here for a quick meal before the game.  Several parking garage is nearby within a walking distance, it was easy to find after I parked my car.  Just like any other Ahi Poki, same deals. Walk up, pick the size (regular or large). Regular comes with 2 scoops, large is 3scoops of fishes.   Considering they opened just a few days ago, all the staff was well trained and friendly, ordering was smooth and easy.  Same quality food as any other stores, so close to the Talking Stick Arena and the Chase field, great place to come for a quick meal before the game!"}
{"text":"Came here on the grand opening day and was a bit disappointed.  They had 50% off special all day during grand opening.  Service was good considering they just opened.  Tuna I had was watery, it was so unfortunate. When the manager walked by, I mentioned tuna is watery and doesn't taste good, he offered to remake a bowl as he thought the tuna was saw at the edge. Not sure why sitting at the edge makes tuna taste like that.   I ordered 3 scoops and had enough food already and didn't feel like eating anymore.   All others tasted as good as other locations."}
{"text":"Ahipoki opens its 9th locations in the valley and finally the one close to me! Their first location in AZ opened just about a year ago, that's pretty fast to open 9 restaurants in one year. Nice to see more poke places in the valley.  Since I had a bad experience in other location, I was avoiding Ahipoki entirely for a while but I couldn't pass up there grand opening deal of 50% off! Came in between lunch and dinner time to avoid any lines but they weren't too busy at all.   Friendly staff welcomed us immediately after walking in, the same process of building your own bowl begun. I like their red pickles only available at Ahipoki chains. Side choice seemed less than other Ahipoki places but it could be only on grand opening day.  This particular visit brought back faith in Ahipoki chain and since they are located on my way home from work, I will be stopping by here more often"}
{"text":"I like the place cuz it's near work but the fish scoops should be bigger scoops. They have a competitor I go to as well which is koi poke which I think is better because of the serving size being better"}
{"text":"I was super excited about poke. I loved it when I was in Maui and was excited to have it here in AZ. So they way they serve you was kind of like Chipotle.  I felt the rice was very dry, it was not as flavorful and there was very little amount of poke. I felt maybe there need to be more sauce if you're eating with salad. Also poke in Maui have been soaked in seasoning which makes it so much more flavorful. Where as there it's just raw fish then a sauce they mix in."}
{"text":"I'm so hooked! Amazing food, fast, easy and friendly as well as great prices! Love it"}
{"text":"Very tasty. Lots of great choices. Just a bit pricey for he amount given! Still cheaper than buying lots of sushi though! And the macaron ice cream sandwiches are to DIE FOR!!!"}
{"text":"Stoped by with a friend. You pick a base, 2 or three ingredients and there are like 10 or so sides to choose from.  A regular bowl (2 scoops) runs about $10. Avocado is a dollar extra. So more like $11 which is pricey for a lunch and can't be a regular thing (not including a drink). The portion size is a tad small too. The ingredients were good but smaller amount compared to other places but still decent variety. I have been to better places but this is good for a fast food place in Arizona. The environment was cool as they play non stop EDM music and have two tvs going."}
{"text":"Not a great poke experience today. It was so dry. The rice wasn't sticky, just really dry. Too bad."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good.  Had the bowl for lunch.  The flavors are delicious. Very patient staff for a new customer. Great choices and toppings.  Try the mixture for the special drink."}
{"text":"Not going lie, I was a little skeptical of poke place in Phoenix, but Ahipoke did not disappoint.  I was in town for a week and I ended up coming here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner.  The restaurant is set up like Chipotle or Subway expect for poke bowls.  You start by picking your base - rice, greens, etc.  I got a salad both times.  The regular size comes with two scoops of poke.  I made the mistake of not looking in the case before I picked my poke flavors as there was a few more flavor options in the case than was listed on the menu board.  I loved the blazing salmon flavor!  After the poke selection, you can pick a dressing and all the toppings you want.  There is a good selection of sauces and the toppings were all fresh tasting.  I really liked the seaweed salad and edamame toppings.  All in all, I think this is a pretty healthful and tasty place for a meal."}
{"text":"This place serves poke items, meaning fish served with various items such as salad, rice, avocados, etc... After hearing so much about this place, I was disappointed by how mediocre it was. I have been to other smaller poke restaurants around town and this was by far the worst one I've been to.  The restaurant itself has a very trendy, clean interior design. This location in particular feels very new. One would order food at a counter. You basically go through a line, tell them what you want, and they scoop it for you, similar to Chipotle or Cafe Rio. You pay at the end of the counter and seat yourself at a table of your choosing. I purchased an extra large half/half poke bowl for about $13 after tax. I felt it was a little pricey compared to other places, especially since it was only three scoops of seafood. The rice itself was really dry and the fish lacked flavor. One of the fish items I ordered was the spicy tuna. I am not a spicy-addict, so I can usually taste spiciness. This spicy tuna was not even remotely spicy... They serve the food in a clear to-go container, and makes it convenient for carryout, but cheapens the feel and presentation. They do have large portion size so that is a bonus. The customer service was mediocre. One guy sensed that it was my first time there so he was extremely helpful. Once he passed me off to another employee, he was less helpful, and offered little guidance.   Overall, mediocre food with mediocre service. Restaurant is nice but is lacking overall."}
{"text":"This place is a great poke bowl. Their fish is fresh and the service was friendly and efficient too. Every poke place does their spicy tuna differently, and the flavor of this one isn't my favorite, but still tasty. Their house sauce is to die for and worth a try. Definitely a good place if you're looking for a fresh, delicious meal"}
{"text":"Great place ! Fish was fresh and the two women working were beyond nice, customer service was great!"}
{"text":"It's like subway but for poke bowls. I loved this! It was inexpensive and fresh and delicious. I wish there was a place like this near me because I'd go there every day. It was really filling. I love sushi and sashimi and to me this was like a big deconstructed sushi bowl. The staff were really friendly and helpful, too!"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant as I was driving from an appointment. It's a great place! Very healthy food and it's setup as an assembly line for building your bowl. There was a pretty long line but it moved quickly. I will surely revisi"}
{"text":"Fine, but nothing spectacular. Basic topping options, brown rice/spring mix option, $1.50 upcharge for the avo, but no limit on toppings. Friendly staff. OK if you want are already parked downtown and want a fast poke fix."}
{"text":"Fine, but definitely not the best poke option in town. The regular is on the small-size, but the large is really large. Tried the octopus, salmon, and tuna- good portions, but some of the pieces were chewy (mediocre cuts). Not a huge range of toppings and they up-charge for avo typical, as well as masago, crab salad, and seaweed salad. So really, not many options included for the basic price. The house sauce is not what I expected- a sweet teriyaki flavor that I wasn't loving. Should've tasted first. The staff, though, is fantastic. Super friendly and patiently explained the process and all ingredients to my poke-newbie sis. Probably wouldn't return, but glad we checked it out."}
{"text":"I have been praying to the Poke Gods to please build something in the valley (so I don't have to keep driving to Cali for good Poke).  You can imagine how stoked I was when Ahi Poki Bowl opened!  Disclaimer *I lived in Hawaii, I know my poke...and I must say this place was pretty good!  It's kind of run like a salad bar where you go through and build it piece by piece (e.g. what rice you want?, which types of poke?, toppings, sauce..).  I got brown rice with salmon and octopus, all the veggie goodness and the mirin garlic sauce.  It looks like a gigantic mound of food but I managed to polish it all off in one sitting.  So I know they have 2 locations now.. I'm praying for a third in either Mesa or Gilbert (or both) but hey the drive is a lot shorter to South Scottsdale/Chandler then Cali."}
{"text":"I wasn't too sure about the raw fish. Or the fish in general, as I really don't like the taste, however..I had the tuna luau on white rice and it was amazing! Didn't taste fishy at all and I couldn't stop eating!"}
{"text":"So in love! One of us got the half salad half brown rice and the other got white rice (mixing salad with rice is just yucky! LOL). White rice with one scoop tuna and two scoops salmon and the other with tuna luau. Mixed house with garlic sauce for white rice and spicy house and house for salad. In heaven! First time here, turned out to be BOGO night so was crazy busy! We WILL be back!!!"}
{"text":"First visit and I can't wait to return. I had the large Ahipoki Bowl and chose 3 scoops, 1 tuna, spicy and 2 marinated in soy. The young girl behind the counter was very knowledgeable and I took her advice on toppings and flavours. Was simply delicious. I was charged $1.50 extra for a small scoop of avocado but was told it was organic etc. The rice is changed every 4 hours and fish arrives from California.  I also had a combination of Thai and Green tea and this complemented my bowl well. It came to $17 in total (food and drink). Good quality excellent taste"}
{"text":"It's essentially a deconstructed build your own sushi roll how could you go wrong? If you don't like fish steer clear of this place. It is also incredibly filling (probably the rice) and good quality. Will be back"}
{"text":"Great service, good sized portions, modern and chic interior. I love that they don't charge extra for brown rice.   If the sauce options are overwhelming, I would suggest the House Sauce. It was delicious with the salmon."}
{"text":"OK, my lunch on the run was super tasty!  Actually, it was stupid good.   Their bowls come in 2 sizes -- regular and large.   I ordered the regular size (ahi tuna and kimchi shrimp on greens) and I was taken aback by all of the toppings included.  Wished I would have  remembered to take a photo of my delicious bowl.   The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because the music playing in the background made me feel like I was at a rave or something and I think it made me eat faster.  And this is coming from someone who likes EDM.  Maybe slow down the tempo a little to Calvin Harris or Avicii during lunch time?   Anyways, can't wait to go back and if the same rave music is playing,  I'll just take my food to go."}
{"text":"I have been on a Poké hunt here in town lately. I love it so much that I wanted to try everyone. My experience has been mixed to say the least. I've tried  2 before agipoki bowl. I think I found the winner. Like most it's set up to build your own bowl.   1. Choose your base. I had 1/2 organic salad and 1/2 brown rice. The brown rice was perfectly moist, not dry like I've had.   2.  Choose your fish. I got the 2 scoop regular and chose ahi tuna and their kimchee shrimp.  3.  Choose your toppings. To be honest they have the most toppings I've ever seen. I went with them all. It did make it near impossible to close the top and smashed everything a little a bit.  4. Choose dry toppings. I got crispy onions and sesame seeds.  For the money this place is right on. I got in and out quickly but should have stayed to eat. The atmosphere is upbeat with great tunes and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Most Poké places don't have a good atmosphere but this one does. I've had better fish but for that you pay $15 per bowl. The fish here is very good and I paid $10 so well worth it if you are a Poké lover."}
{"text":"Love the food! Place is not always the cleanest place even when they're not that busy but honestly the best Poke in the East Valley."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  It is one of our favorite places to go to for lunch/dinner.  I am glad they opened one up in the East Valley."}
{"text":"This chain keeps opening up left and right in the valley and it comes as no surprise that the employees make absolutely no eye contact. There are two gentlemen in the companies polo shirt towards the register who help out seem to be the manager have absolutely no respect for customer. The one guy with the goatee I had asked him a question and he blew me off. So rude and disrespectful."}
{"text":"Great poki for the price. Not sushi restaurant quality, but everything is fresh. It's great when you want to scratch that ahi poki itch. Honestly, it's the best balance of price and quality under 15 dollars."}
{"text":"Delicious. Fresh. Clean. Reasonably priced. Friendly service. I've been here twice this week, and can't wait to go back. Great healthy addition to chandler."}
{"text":"Best poke bowl I had in Arizona. It's very fresh and the workers are very friendly. I eat there when I'm craving sushi best prices and very clean inside. I get most of the toppings on my bowl my favorite is the spicy tuna! Delicious healthy food!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight. We were pleasantly surprised! Restaurant itself is very clean, and the staff were really friendly and helpful (even though they all seemed really young) since we weren't familiar with the menu. I had a small bowl with shrimp, and my boyfriend had a large bowl with spicy tuna and aloha tuna; both with rice. The seafood was really fresh, and the sauces were great without being overwhelming. We both thought they were plenty filling, and a good deal for the price - especially consider the fish tasted great.  We will definitely return to try some different combinations!"}
{"text":"Love love love poki bowls.  I've always gone to the one in South Scottsdale and got an email about this one opening up.  I hapenned to be in the area the day it was opening up and coincidentally got a $5 bowl coupon.  Place was super packed, I waited 20 minutes just to get my bowl.  They charge for extra scoops of salad ingredients unlike the one in Scottsdale who just throws it in for you.  Other than that I'm a happy camper.  Really clever that they open up near Chipotle locations capitalizing on the have it your way food concept.  They also know everyone must be tired of Chipotle and want something unique, healthy, and fast."}
{"text":"Ok...came back after a bad experience..decided to give this location a second chance and I regretted it the minute I started ordering. Employees just have a really bad attitude at this place. Lady seemed like she was slamming dog food on my bowl. This place is not cheap at all that's why they should give you a full scoop portion of fish I would think..not at all...4 cubes of tuna per portion...really??? Never ever coming back again. Look for better employees Ahipoki or you are going to loose more loyal customers."}
{"text":"I like poke, but not a fan of this place. The scallops tasted bad, and when I asked for extra crab she said sure. Then when I checked out she told me it was gonna be extra. It would be nice to know that when I asked for it."}
{"text":"Very small portions for the price. Tried the spicy Poke with their spicy house sauce, and neither were spicy. First time there, and will probably be the last."}
{"text":"Amazing! This place is legit! New location and the place is clean. Step in line and pick out your flavor. Your first choices what type of rice or salad or both. 2nd choice is what kind of fish. After that it's at all the toppings you want. Crap, seaweed, edamame, onions, etc.... One of the coolest things ever.... This place has Thai tea on tap!! They also have 2 other cool options but Thai tea is my favorite so it's hard to stray and try something new. Don't worry though they also have soda's for the plain janes. Bahahaha! I've only had the pleasure of eating at this place twice since I found it and it's out of my way but I plan on stopping in for some more anytime I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"SO SAD! Thoroughly disappointed after being quite excited to try this place.   Tropical drink=watered down Kool-aid. Tuna=frozen with ice crystals. The crab salad was clearly imitation. The fish scoops were surprisingly small and the bowl ended up to be mostly rice. Ended up paying $18 for one severely lacking bowl and two soft drinks.  Definitely paying for a trend with this place (not quality). It's in an old Pollo Loco with a shut down drive through people park in. I don't understand all the rave reviews. Friends-go get some real poke in California or Hawaii and revise your ratings. Personally I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Went to the Scottsdale one and loved it so much, and wished they would open one in/near Ahwatukee. They are Psychic, right?! So happy! So fresh! I get half brown rice, half salad with avocado for an extra $1, then spicy tuna and regular tuna wth both House spicy & Ginger soy sauces. Lots of good toppings, and voila! A fabulous lunch. Have brought 4 different people, everyone always says its 5 stars and can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I am new to the Ahipoki scene, and I have to say that this did not disappoint! The food tastes great, and the presentation is awesome! It is great to eat a colorful, healthy meal, that is also filling. I need to get back and try out the Spicy Tuna next time!   The only thing that bugs me is the extra $1 for Avocado. I know this is not exclusive to this restaurant. I am paying for a large bowl. Just throw in the Avocado!   But, in the end...this is a winner!"}
{"text":"This is the second time coming to this eatery a second time. The food was good, but the place was a bit skimpy on their toppings. Especially for the price that it was charging. The atmosphere of the place was modern with a hint of rustic.   I ordered the regular portion with two scoops of meat served with the salad option (yellowtail and Maui tuna). The Maui tuna was tossed in a soy base sauce with some green onions. I chose the house spicy sauce because I love spicy but it was a bit salty. I topped off my salad with the creamy spicy mayo which was delicious and paired well with the tuna and yellowtail. For the toppings I added masago (fish roe), sprouts, green onions, seaweed salad and furikaki.   Definitely give this place a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. Wow. I just had lunch at Ahipoki and I'm sure glad  I stumbled on to this fantastic restaurant in downtown. fresh,fast and very unique. So far this year, Ahipoki is the freshest ahi tuna I have eaten."}
{"text":"My go-to lunch spot. Drew and his staff are the best and the Poke is always delicious!"}
{"text":"Out of all the poke bowl places that I have been to in Arizona, this is the best  place with the freshest fish and the softest fish with the best flavors and the best topping options and delicious sauces and delicious juice. This is my favorite place ever ever ever. My only complaint is that there aren't more of these places so that I can always have one around. I do not live around one so when I am in the area of one of these places I have to go, it is a must!"}
{"text":"The food is great! Very fresh and authentic.. poke is my favorite food and since I travel for work I eat it all over the country. This one stands with the best of them. Wish they had jalapeños but it's all good. The employees are personable, friendly, and informative. It was my first time at this location so I wanted to understand what their different house sauces were. The girl employee explained everything to me and was really sweet! I will be back"}
{"text":"This place is mix of between sushi and a rice bowl place. It's good but I got burnt out on it quickly. Lots of people all the time, and you have to pay for upgrades on certain foods"}
{"text":"It was alright. I felt like I paid too much though. Like I said, for what it is, it was fine, but I just felt like I paid a little too much for what I actually got. The tea tasted kinda dirty too"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place and instantly felt like it was a good choice. Rice was fresh, tuna was very good, and salmon tasted delicious.  Portions can be a bit small, except for the rice, but outside of that it was a win.   If you're looking for a light, tasty lunch this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Very good and the price is right  Had luau tuna, yellow tail, and salmon... fish was fresh and the sauce was on point  Need this in south Florida.."}
{"text":"Like fish? Go. Like sushi? Go. Like delicious food? GO! Fresh, tasty and speedy."}
{"text":"I thought it was okay. At least they tried. No poke is better than the poke from the islands. I like the piled high toppings you can get with your poke bowl. I never heard of poke on salad before. Lol! That's kind of weird. I guess that's the trend now."}
{"text":"My first time.  Prior to this I had some poke samples in Hawaii.    I can be pretty critical of rice.  Theirs was cooked just right.  I went w spicy tuna.  It was good, just like sushi rolls.  Fresh avocado, cucumbers.  Got ginger and wasabi.  Did the House spicy sauce.  It wasn't spicy to my standards but tasted good.  My only confusion was the krab salad.  It said \"extra scoop .75.  I assumed it came with one and any extra would be .75.  Nonetheless, it was good.  Portions are good.  As long as they keep the freshness and portion then $10 for a regular bowl is okay.  You can't expect McDonald's prices--we are talking raw fish.  That comes with a cost to be fresh and safe.    Nice staff.  Polite and patient since I was new there."}
{"text":"The sizes of their bowls are perfect and their fish is fresh. I got the small bowl with yellowtail and spicy tuna. The spicy tuna was shredded so I'd probably swap that out for shrimp or salmon next time but still delicious. For sauce I got garlic soy mirin and for toppings the crab salad, seaweed salad, sesame seeds, green onion, and avocado. The avocado and yellowtail were a dollar extra and that wasn't specified on the menu but all and all delicious."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Ahipoki, and it was good! Fresh raw sashimi. The macaroon ice creams are delish too."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food. My favorite place to eat in Avondale by far, just wish they would be more generous with the toppings. (Seaweed salad, crab salad,  etc."}
{"text":"This amazing place opened up about a month ago! The staff is so friendlythe management is amazing, they are very quick to serve in their quality of food is spectacular! It's very hard to find a sushi place or a pokey place that is clean and well managed! But this place takes the cake I am so happy that they opened up near my home, please check this place out if you're looking for a healthy light and refreshing meal.its like a family place. There house spicy sauce is so yummmmm! And try the Thai Tea, it's so delish! Overall great food, great people & great AHI POKE!"}
{"text":"This place is great! You can get a very healthy meal with salad rice fish and assorted vegetables for around $10. The sauces are great. They have lots of good choices to customize your bowl."}
{"text":"Definitely my new obsession. 100% lives up to the reviews. Fast, fresh, and healthy. Staff is always in a good mood and I am in and out after the gym in less than 5 minutes. It is right across from a Tokyo Joe's which i am also a fan of. However, I would never choose Joe's again now that Ahipoki is here. Well done!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!! This place NEVER disappoints! Everything is always fresh and the fish is delicious! My newest favorite is my poke over mixed greens, add avocado of course (work the extra cash) some yummy spicy mayo on top and this makes the perfect low carb meal!! I could eat poke everyday!"}
{"text":"Favourite fast poki I've tried. Usually get half brown half salad with tuna luau and spicy shrimp. Mix my salad with house sauce and spicy mayo. Add guac. Get everything on there. (Even wasabi and ginger). Finish your meal with the green tea macaron. Bomb."}
{"text":"My only complaint is there isn't one closer to downtown Phoenix. Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Poke is gold! Service is terrible. Employees are unhappy and grumpy. The server was stingy with every ingredient and had a negative attitude. No smile :("}
{"text":"Food was great! Customer service could be better. I didn't feel welcomed at all. The first time I was there it was a great experience but this time was a complete 180. The first girl had an attitude with me like I was being a bother for simply walking into the restaurant and wanting.... food. Usually I would just leave but I was hungry and wanted to eat ASAP. There's many poke places in the area so definitely will consider those before I go here again."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from many friends. Despite of their good review, i still had doubts since i dont believe in \" fastfood \" sushi. I had tuna and salmon salad with spicy creamy sauce. It was very fresh and tasty and I was very pleased with its overall quality. The place was very clean and comtemporary. Only downside is its small portion and high price. I would definitely come back more but it is not a everyday meal since it is bit pricy."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with this Ahipoki location.  I am a regular to the location in Tempe (minimum, once per week), but I was in the area and came to this location instead. My experience was less than satisfactory here.  Every time I order, I get the same thing. A little bit of brown rice and mostly salad, avocado and red onion on top, 3 scoops blazing salmon, and my toppings - green onion, edamame, ginger, cucumber, sprouts, and extra pickled radish. I always explain that I will pay extra for the pickled radish.  Apparently paying extra for pickled radish is not okay at this location and the employee refused to give me more than two very small scoops. When I told him again I would pay extra, he told me he couldn't do it, packed up my box, and walked away in the middle of me asking him why. The other two employees saw the whole interaction and did nothing to correct it.  I will not be returning to this location. I am very sad that I have to write a negative review about an Ahipoki location, as it is one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Quick, easy, priced right and GREAT food! Ingredients were so fresh and it was wonderful to build my own bowl. I could eat here daily!"}
{"text":"A friend insisted I try this place with her since she raved about it. It didn't disappoint. Freshest ingredients, reasonable price, friendly staff who took time out to talk to us and mentioned they're putting another location up by Desert Ridge near where we live. We'll definitely be frequent flyers!"}
{"text":"I love this place but really wish they would offer a child size! I see a ton of kids in here all the time, so I don't think I'm the only person in this situation. As of now I'm expected to have to just adjust my order to accommodate. Too bad for me, I like it spicy, but my son does not. Would give 5 stars if not for this annoyance."}
{"text":"Place was awesome! It's like the chipotle of sushi? Good ingredients and friendly staff. Everything that's awesome about sushi without being in a roll form. Loved it. Great concept."}
{"text":"Everything here is very fresh! The food is really amazing, I highly recommend the spicy tuna and kimchi shrimp. I am a big eater...I personally just get the small bowl because the times I've bought large I did not finish it. The staff is either super friendly or indifferent, it just depends on who is working. It definitely is worth the stop if you like fresh uncooked seafood!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! I would eat it every day if I could! If you're a sushi lover, you'll enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Issue resolved. Thank you, Jason, for going the extra mile to correct this accidental overcharge."}
{"text":"Ahipoki Bowl  Ahipoki Bowl was my introduction to poké, and I still go back from time to time...  Recommended, but with caveats (read on...)  Even though I have nearly 100 check-ins, it's been a while since I came here. Honestly I wanted to get to 100 check-ins before writing my review, but alas, I may not make it to 100. I guess you could say I've moved on to other poké options nearby.  Food: I bought my standard \"low carb\" bowl: regular size with a base of mixed greens, tuna and spicy tuna for my protein, ginger, masago, krab salad, edamame, cucumber, and chili flakes. For my sauce I selected house spicy, with a bit of extra chili oil. I've had basically that same bowl almost every time I come here. But today, the tuna wasn't right. The taste was ok, but the texture was off. Instead of being firm, it was a bit spongy and chewy - not a texture I liked! I've not had this issue before, so maybe it was just an off-day.  Not exactly related to the food, but they have a new kind of chopsticks! I've used chopsticks for decades, and I'm good at it. I've used chopsticks virtually every time I've come here, including those times I order to-go. But they've changed. Instead of being round, these things are oval-shaped in cross-section. It doesn't sound like a big deal, except they kept shifting in my grasp, and I found it quite difficult to actually eat with them. I managed, but it was a struggle for the entire meal.  Cost: My regular bowl with no adders was a reasonable $10.28 including tax. BUT an employee said avocado was now $1.50 extra! I noticed the menu still said it was $1.  Service:  It's like Chopotle: as you walk down the line, you tell them what to put in your bowl. The employees are generally friendly, so there's that.  Atmosphere: There's not much to say - it's functional inside, not attractive. And today the music was very overbearing. They were playing some sort of beat music with loud, thumping bass. It was overall too loud and intrusive for my taste.  Overall: Honestly it saddens me to say, this place reminds me of my first crush in a way. It was great for a while, but it didn't have staying power, at least for me."}
{"text":"Since this place has opened its been a staple in my when I eat out rotation. I've been there about 10 times since it opened & the food has been consistent. What has not been consistent it what I'm behind charged for.  My husband dove in head first when this place opened. He's tried almost every fish they have. I'm a little more cautious when it comes to ordering seafood at places I'm not familiar with. The first at least 5 times I didn't get any raw fish. I know it's a little strange, but I was getting the crab mix as my \"fish\" instead. They do not have a standard way to charge this meal. I would think that might be something they want to consider for kids, or for people like me.  I have been getting the raw fish the last few times I went. I like the spicy tuna & kimchi shrimp. As others have mentioned it does seem like the fish & crab servings have gotten smaller over time. They e also started to offer shrimp which I do not think is something they did when they first opened.  Overall I will continue to come back because I enjoy the food. I'm happy to have the new addition to the list of places we frequent. However, check your receipt, I've had them charge me for a large when I got a regular before & also a few other times when I've been overcharged. It would be nice to see what they are ringing me up for or at least confirm my order before ringing it up."}
{"text":"First time here and it won't be the last.  Super friendly and helpful staff. The bowls were great. Everything looked fresh and tasted great."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another try.  My food was better this time as I went with the all rice bowl over the salad and did spicy tuna and octopus as the fish choices.  I added crab salad too and that filled me up.  Price wise I still don't feel there is any value here.  $10+ for a bowl of rice and a couple ounces of fish is no deal but it's fast and fairly healthy.    The location is maddening.  There are 12 immediate parking spaces (I counted them) so you're better off just parking at the far end of the Bed, Bath & Beyond lot which is right there.  Inside there are very few tables and you may find yourself hovering over others while waiting for them to leave if you elect to eat there.  Grab it to go if you really want it."}
{"text":"(note: I am vegan) This place was incredible!! I went with my significant other (who does not have dietary restrictions) and we walked in not fully knowing what to expect. Quickly we were greeted by a nice younger guy who explained everything in detail. When he didn't know something, other team members (and yes, they worked as a TEAM :D) chimed in to clear up any questions. The owner was even there and helped make our food! To have the owner teach their workers how things are done by doing so themselves, with a smile, shows they truly care about the customer, workers and finished product. We will be returning!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great find! First visit the guy at counter helped me build a delicious bowl of greens, tuna, and toppings! The sauce was spicy and really made the dish! I could eat there every day!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best fast food restaurant since Fired Pie or Chipotle, but way better! Fresh, healthful, and delicious! Mahalo, Ahipoki Bowl!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!! Even on bogo days the staff is friendly and willing to explain how the process works. We came on a bogo day so it was busy and they ran out of iced tea the second I asked Riggs came out of no where made the tea took the trash out all while having a smile on his face. I tried the tropical drink it's super sugary but has good flavor. The only I would change is if they could make it into a burrito ."}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love. I am so glad I don't have to drive to Scottsdale or Downtown to enjoy my favorite poke place, though my wallet is likely not as thrilled.  This location is off to a great start! The staff is so friendly, the food is very fresh and the restaurant is clean.   This will definitely be a neighborhood go-to!"}
{"text":"My meal looked so appetizing, I forgot to take a photo of it before I devoured it. Has a brown rice base for spicy tuna and salmon poke with garlic soy Kirin sauce. Side of avocado and topped with seaweed salad, crab salad and crispy onions. Now, that's a delectable selection. All ingredients were fresh!  I could have gone for the large bowl but I didn't want to stuff myself. Place is clean and bright. Will return on my next trip back to Arizona. Wish we had this in the East Coast. I dream of opening one"}
{"text":"It seems that this place is quite popular, but I have a few complaints as to why it's just ok. The music is far too loud and it causes everyone to talk extremely loudly to talk over each other. I suppose if you're there by yourself it's not a problem. Seating is limited for how busy they get for lunch. It's also hard to hear the servers when trying to get your order not that their demeanor was friendly to begin with. My next issue is that they trap you with the fact that avocado is extra immediately, as you enter the serving line. It's really tempting but when the regular costs $9.50 and the large costs $11.50 for LUNCH it is expensive to add an extra dollar even if it is for delicious avocado. They again have another trap of extra when it comes to yellowtail my favorite fish is also $1 extra. I do commend their tasty luau tuna as it does add a nice flavor to the bowl.   Now on to their sauces, I tried all of them before deciding to mix the house spicy with the sweet citrus. I am not a huge fan of the creamy sauce it is too thick and covers the taste of the fish. The garlic sauce was oddly sweet and I found it unsettling since it didn't have citrus flavor and the house sauce just tastes like sesame oil and soy sauce. I wasn't too pleased with any of the sauces to be honest but I had to choose. The sweet citrus was like a sugary yuzu sauce and house spicy tastes like they just added chili oil. I suppose you pick to your liking but I wasn't pleased.  Then you choose your toppings which is unclear what costs extra and what doesn't but it stacks up to 0.75 extra per premium topping which includes the seaweed salad and crab meat salad (the staple of pokebowls). The scoop for edamame is tiny and barely the size of my thumb, every topping was stingily placed in the tiny black plate.  If I had gotten everything I wanted I probably would have paid $16 for my light snack. They should call it pokeplate rather than pokebowl. I will admit that the fish was fresh and their cucumbers had a nice crunch which was satisfying but otherwise I left nearly as hungry as my wallet had become after paying. I can see why others like this place due to the convenient location and seemingly plentiful options but I know better tasting and cheaper places for more food, if you ever go to tempe Pokedon is new and amazing."}
{"text":"Really good despite it being raw seafood at a fast food joint. Awesome toppings, sauces. It's a build your own bowl concept. Everything tastes fresh."}
{"text":"This review is late, but better late than never! When I moved here from Hawaii and needed an immediate Poke fix that was not too far from me. I came here and was very impressed with the fresh crisp vegetables and fresh seafood. Makes me wish I was back in Hawaii!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and spicy an wonderful and amazing there are not enough words to describe how good this food is. I tried the kimchi spinach omg !! You must try!!!!"}
{"text":"This is basically the Chipotle of sushi, and it's even better than Chipotle! You pick your base and toppings as you go down the line. It's great, fresh, raw fish and no shortage of toppings for your bowl. You can pick the amount of fish you want in your bowl so you can customize it perfectly to how hungry you are. I will keep coming back for more, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! Employees are very rude, Even as a first timer. I ask servers questions and are so disrespectful. I went to both locations and experienced the same thing: BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE! Food is great but not as great as the customer service."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! Made to order, super fresh. Every bite delicious. This WILL be a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Will not be returning to the chandler location. Scottsdale is amazing always upbeat with fresh food. The chandler location has disappointed me now 3 times. The girl who helped us today did not smoke once and seemed agitated that we were there. Even said to the cashier she couldn't wait until ...... I couldn't here what she said. Just so rude. I do love the other location though and I will drive out of my way to go there. This one on the other hand should get a new staff."}
{"text":"The food was much better than I expected!   I didn't expect much since there isn't any ocean around, but the seafood was surprisingly fresh. It was my first time eating a poke bowl, and I would totally come back for more! It's kind of like Chipotle where you go and order things down the line. I got the smaller of the two options, and it seemed soooo tiny, but it was really dense! I came with a few friends that live in the area, and they've been back several times since! The place is small so we kind of had to hover over people who were almost done eating, which I don't really enjoy doing."}
{"text":"A little pricey but Soo good! We'll definitely go back. Fish was fresh and the service was fast."}
{"text":"Huge portions , fresh ingredients, and I must say for a chain it's pretty delicious!!! I love that you can customize to your liking and try different combos each time.   Honestly I had it twice during their customer appreciation celebration!!! Can't go wrong with 50% off"}
{"text":"The food was great!! VERY fresh and tasty combinations! The music was really loud however, which makes it hard to have conversations. The service was mostly friendly :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We came here when they first opened and enjoyed the food. The staff was very helpful. This was our second visit and everything was equally delicious. I think the price is very fair for what you get $10.95 for a large bowl which comes with choice rice and salad, especially considering that it's fresh seafood! I love it that they have A free kids bowl so my munchkin gets to eat free!  I can really appreciate all of the fresh toppings that you can choose from. It makes your meal burst with flavor. I probably had 20 different ingredients layered in my bowl."}
{"text":"If you love sushi served to you Chipotle style,  Ahipoke is the place to go.  This was the first time I've ever been to a poke bar and I loved it! I was a little overwhelmed with all their options at first but the staff there was very friendly and helpful. They explained the different options and have recommendations on what to get based on what you like.    Overall,  the location was clean,  ingredients were fresh, the staff was friendly and the price for the bowl was worth it."}
{"text":"My work is just a block away so I grab Ahipoki Bowl to-go at least once a week when I'm working late in the office. I'm a big fan of their tuna & salmon with their house sauce! Yum! Their employees are very nice & always quick & efficient!"}
{"text":"Coming from Las Vegas, the land of sushi bowls and sushi burritos, I was actually a little bit disappointed in this place. I did like the fact that it was within walking distance of the hotel I stayed at (Marriott courtyard) but the incredible yum feeling just wasn't there for me.  I ended up eating the regular size half and half with tuna luau and salmon as my meats. The fish itself was tasty and very fresh. For a sauce I went with the house sauce which seemed pretty bland to me. As for the other toppings I had the masago, cucumber, seaweed salad and onion flakes. I did enjoy the variety of options. I just wish the flavors wowed me more.  I think this place might be better if they had the option to order just the fish by itself as a side. I would have enjoyed that more."}
{"text":"Their locations are no where near me but so worth the drive for a bowl! Their food is DABOMBDOTCOM"}
{"text":"Got the puny-est scoops of fish ever as well as toppings.   He banged out so jt was a lebl scoop and then the topping...wow I literally got 5 sprouts, FIVE!!!  Come on what am I paying for.  At least I got a good base of greens but nothing much else.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"the service here is always amazing! I'm in and out of the door within 10 minutes or less. The food and ingredients are always fresh and they give you a heaping amount of food. Yes it's pricey, but it costs to keep yourself healthy! The only thing I would change about this business is the music. To me it's mildly irritating and almost awful. Other than that, the employees are great and the restaurant is always clean. I consider myself a regular :,) btw the best type of sauce mix is the house, spicy creamy, and the garlic soy."}
{"text":"Loving this new restaurant in South Gilbert and Zach is the best! He is generous on the scoops, so friendly, and strategically places ingredients - I.E. wasabi on the side not dead center. I am not only such a fan of the food but the place has a great vibe. The space is wide and the aesthetic is chill. Two TVs - one Fox Sports and the other ESPN. Keep the standards high and the customer service great and this restaurant will be successful for a long time to come."}
{"text":"Fast food Chirashi and for what it is, its ok.  Found the rice a bit dry and undercooked.  The servings from my Large Bowl (3 scoops of fish) and the toppings were adequate.  Quality of the fish was adequate for fast food.  Tried the House Spicy sauce and found it salty with no spice.  Next time, I would skip this.  The limited \"service\" is adequate for Fast food.  Management might want to make sure that staff does their job cleaning the space.  Walked in as they opened and sat at a new table to find that the table wasn't cleaned from the night before."}
{"text":"First time at one of these. Walked in a bit overwhelmed but the guy at the counter was super patient and helpful explaining how it all works. I did a large, half brown rice half organic greens, added avocado (+ $1.50), red onion, ahi tuna, tuna luau, and salmon, and the house spicy sauce. Then we got to the toppings. This was easily the most impressive part for me. You could do any topping at least once, and then some premium toppings like masago or crab salad mix are extra if you add a SECOND scoop. So I gladly added the masago, crab mix, scallions, micro greens, seaweed salad, edamame and the some dried seaweed flakes. The meal was delicious and I hope one of these opens up near my work!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite and kinda expensive for what you get. I liked the shrimp bowl the best."}
{"text":"Veni, vidi, poki.  Same poke bowls, different location. This ahipoki location seems smaller than the Scottsdale restaurant and the dedicated building parking lot is small, although there is plenty of parking surrounding the immediate area. There is a drive through area as well but I'm not sure if they are offering drive through for the bowls.  We went for the soft opening around 2:15 and while there was a steady stream of customers it wasn't extremely crowded. I went with a 2 scoop bowl with salad, house dressing, luau tuna, yellowtail, masago, crab salad, edamame, jicama, seaweed salad, cucumber, seaweed strips, crispy onion, and sesame seed. The fish was fresh and flavorful, and I liked it with the other ingredients except for the crispy onion. The onion bits were too hard and distracted from the other textures in the salad.  I also had an iced tea, which comes unsweetened. It was light and refreshing.  The 2 scoop portion was a little under $9 and the iced tea was $2.99.   Service was fast and friendly.  I've tried the half rice and half salad before and I liked my meal with only salad because all the food is the same temperature vs. the rice which will come hot.  I'll be back for more ahipokin'!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit.The menu lists many of the options so it takes a few minutes to read. The food was good, but a bit pricey for what you're getting. A whole lot of rice (if you order the rice bowl) and not as much topping as you would think. But what upset me was they asked if we wanted guac WITHOUT MENTIONING there is an additional $1.50 charge for the 2 scoop rice bowl that costs $9.50. Hmmmmm. $11.00 + tax for a small bowl that contains mostly rice. 2 stars is for the sneaky way of upselling without mentioning the added cost. If they were honest about it I wouldn't feel as though I was being scammed. Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome service! The guys were really nice. First time here and will definitely come back again. The atmosphere is really cute and inviting with a great view of the courtyard. I got a bowl with a Thai iced tea that was yummy!!! The seafood was fresh as well. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Ahipoki is easily my favorite \"to-go\" choice. I haven't yet found a time or excuse as to NOT wanting poki when asked... \"where should we go to eat?\"  Ahipoki is clean, fast, friendly and they have THE yummiest drink to choose from in comparison to our other poke hotspots.  For a limited time only they are offering 'blazing salmon' it's spicy, and it's a kind of spice that lingers in your mouth so CAUTION. But it's sure damn fast! I ordered mine with scoops on a bed of salad, every bite eastern and so worth it!  Don't forget to try the Thai tea which is hard to go wrong, never met a Thai Tea I didn't like.  Also, the green tea macaron ice cream for $3.75! Our meal was $25 which seems like a LOT but if we were to sit down at RA for HH we would easily pay double that price.  It's not my 5 star poke only due to the portion on the fish, they seriously skimp. (Don't be shy!)"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good! My favorite is the bowl with the spicy creamy sauce! Also every time I go in there the service is great, they are very friendly and helpful! It is expensive but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Macaron ice cream!  I had this from California restaurants. Glad to see this is az! They have few flavors: vanilla, strawberry, mango, green tea, and coffee.   Tried green tea and mango. Both are good but I liked the green tea flavor more.   Fyi. I was not able to taste mango flavor from mango macaron ... But it was still good. Not too sweet"}
{"text":"Ahipoki Chandler is one of my favorite spots to go in the Phoenix area hands down. Not only is the food amazingly healthy and fresh, the staff makes the experience far better!! Destiny is great! I have been out of state for a few months, walked back in this week, and was so happy to see her! She is so accommodating and helpful, my daughters love her, she makes the experience personable and we love going there. I have yet to visit this location and not have anything but a perfect experience. I go 3-5 days per week, and have nothing but positive feedback to share. Excellent job!!!"}
{"text":"Happened to stumble by this poke place while visiting some family in phoenix. I am from Seattle and was skeptical of the fish quality in the desert. To my surprise Ahipoki is as good as any sushi or poke place in Seattle.  So its set up in a sort of assembly line format where you go from station to station building your bowl.  At each station the employee was helpful and answered all my questions about the unique ingredients they offered. Most poke restaurants in Seattle only have premade bowls so making my own was sort of fun.  Not to mention the price was really low for the amount of food I got. I am used to paying $12-$14 but it only cost $9.50 for the same amount of food.  I tried a home made thai tea and did not like the sweetness and the manager gave me a green tea at no additional charge. The green tea was fantastic and my husband actually went and ordered his own as well as a bowl to go for later.  Unfortunately I only come here once a year or I'd eat here every week.  Can't wait until next year!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with the flagship Scottsdale location the first time I tried it, and the  Chandler installation is just as good. This is the best poké in Arizona. The fish and toppings are of the highest quality. I stick to my favorite bowl: half brown rice and half salad with salmon and luau tuna. I add all the toppings, but put the wasabi on the side. My only recommendation is that the restaurant label the toppings. I know what everything is (masago, edamame, etc) but I can see how it would be overwhelming for a newcomer. I hope they open a third location in Gilbert."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to the Scottsdale and Chandler locations since they opened, and couldn't wait for the Gilbert location. This site is right on par with the others. Delicious poké bowls with fresh ingredients! They also offer a 10% military discount, which I appreciate. I tried the tropical drink today, and it was very tasty! The beverage had a nice combination of guava and mango flavors. It was a little sweet, so I added water, and was able to get more out of my drink. I'll keep coming here for sure!"}
{"text":"I always have an amazing time at Ahipoki Chandler. I visit almost every week and the food is always, ALWAYS fresh and absolutely delicious. Also, you get a big portion for what you pay for. My go-to order is the half and half with brown rice, octopus and salmon with the flavorful house sauce - my absolute favorite! Service is consistently fantastic too - not sure if I agree with some of the other reviewers on here about the quality of the service. Sometimes you just gotta chill out, ya know? Regardless, great place for lunch AND dinner if you're looking for delicious and reasonably priced poki bowls!"}
{"text":"I am very favorably impressed with the way they accommodate their patrons who have disabilities. I asked for assistance in carrying my tray to my table, I have to use one hand on my cane. Also, they twice refilled my fountain drink for me. The food is excellent, the available selections are diverse, the staff courteous and cheerful. They seem to attract a clientele that reflects these qualities. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So, being Hawaiian and living in the mainland I have only found a few authentic places for Poké!  I have to say, that the fish is fresh and is very good quality.  I had the Ahi Luau, regular ahi, and tako (octopus).  I added avocado, tried as many toppings as I could with the house sauce.  I opted for salad as a low carb option.    I have to say I was disappointed in the portions first when you get choke more lettuce and toppings than actual fish!  I also found the poke very bland and not as flavor able as I would expect.  I left over half the salad but ate the fish for sure.    I just happened to stumble on this place and was very excited and leaving sort of satisfied but, not really!  I will eat here again as this was my first time but I will try to be a little more creative."}
{"text":"Best poke in the Scottsdale area, maybe AZ! Bit pricey but well worth it. Staff and owner are very friendly and helpful. A seafood chipotle"}
{"text":"Used to like this place but now the portion of the fish is a faction compare to other competitors. Will probably not come back again"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Filling and fresh. However, it is extremely pricey for lunch. I ordered the 2 scoop regular and it was $12.75 in their menu it said $9.50 so I'm not sure where the extra money came from."}
{"text":"This place was great!  It's like a sashimi Chipotle.  You pick the protein and add as many toppings as you want.  They have a very nice selection of proteins including Hawaiian tuna, spicy tuna, yellowtail, octopus, scallops and more.  Love the toppings...glad I live close as I will be there at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Where's the FISH? I was so excited to try this place, my dining partner and I came on a Monday at 11 a.m. Note the parking lot for this \"what use to be a drive through restaurant\" is horrible! Park in the main strip mall lot and just cross the street. We walked in and approached the order counter the first women just stared at us, \"like... well\" no hello welcome to the Ahipoki Bowl. Service with a smile could be better.  I ordered a 2 scoop salad with Salmon and Tuna with \"everything toppings\". The quantity of salad and choices of toppings are excellent all fresh. The quality of Salmon and Tuna were good, cold and was fresh. The amount of fish for a $10.00 salad is not worth. The Hot Spicy dressing was not spicy at all, though it was good, still not worth $10.00.  I'm glad I tried it once but I'll go to my favorite sushi place and get a \"Crazy Bowl\" (Shrimp served on a bed of Spicy Tuna  served over Rice) for $3.00 extra and I'll have a Crazy LUNCH."}
{"text":"You put your Ahi in, you put your ahi out and you shake it all about!! You do the AhiPoki and you turn yourself around; that's what it's all about!!!   That's how you dine at AhiPoki Bowl!! Love the freshness and variety of it all. The chipotle of sushi bowls with great freshness!!   Came here during lunch and while it was a tad busy don't be discouraged as the line moves fast.  I got the regular bowl with two scoops (Salmon and Luau Tuna) holy magic scoops the tuna was outstanding.  Not to discredit the salmon, but the tuna was on point. Decided to go with mixed greens over rice and it was filling without the bloating feel.   The house sauce was perfect not to tangy. Think I'll go spicy house next time.   Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I prefer the Scottsdale location. The staff at this location does not know the meaning of good service and hospitality. I don't ever feel welcomed upon arriving and when I ask for certain things or don't want certain things on my bowl, I feel that I'm stepping on eggshells to ask. It shouldn't be this way. Portions have gotten smaller and I feel that I don't get my money's worth. Fortunately, there's competition in Chandler at Pokitrition, and that's where you'll find me."}
{"text":"FIRST TIMER!!! This is the first time I've ever tried Poki so I was definitely excited. I was on the edge of my seat walking in and immediately hit the freshest smells. I love sushi and sashimi so this was right up my alley. A great variety to choose from and yes you can get a few items that aren't completely raw lol. The flavors were great I definitely loved the Luah tuna which they added some garlic and onion flavor to. The fresh veggies topped off the meal along with a sauce of your choice, I had to try the house spicy which actually wasn't spicy but honestly flavorful and made my day. My one issue is that I track my food especially when I eat out and I couldn't get the calories for anything from anyone and no one knew the size of ladle that was being used to serve the portions of fish so that was disappointing...overall for sure going back! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Fresh healthy nutritious fast tasty all the right ingredients for a successful restaurant. Its on the high side price wise but reasonable considered that we are in the desert and fish aren't exactly found in the salt river project  its a real winner in my book!!!"}
{"text":"I went here last week after hearing good things from friends. My friends eat out a lot and seemed to enjoy this place so we gave it a chance. The food was reasonably priced for the amount of food that you get with purchase. The fish was fresh and tasted good. No issues after eating here ! The service was okay, nothing really stood out. Being there seemed like ordering at a subway or chipotle restaurant, it's like an assembly line. The atmosphere is like a fast food restaurant. Overall, if your looking for somewhere that has a decent quality and amount of food for the money, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"If you want something healthy but you don't want a plain old salad then try this place!  It is where sushi meets salad bowl with Asian flare. You start of with a base, either just greens or a mix of brown/white rice with greens. Then you get a choice of raw spicy tuna, tuna, salmon or shrimp and all kinds of veggies! If you don't mind raw fish, and some Asian sauces, you will love this place!"}
{"text":"Good food, good value. Healthy. Quick service and a smile. I'll definitely be getting here again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I love this place. I used to live in Tempe and move before their location on rural opened probably to my benefit or else I would have gone weekly. I first went to the one on Ray and I10. What a great concept to have a good quality fast food poki place. I like getting the half salad half brown rice combo. The fish is super fresh. You get unlimited toppings. I was super happy to find out that there was a location opening near me. Finally got to check it out today and I wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"I was in town on business and found this place on yelp. Being a sushi fan I figured to give it a try. I ordered a salad with everything on it, as it was recommended for first time, and I have to tell you it was amazing. I will definitely return here again to try the other options."}
{"text":"Just walked out and really not happy. Employee made no eye contact and wasn't trained properly on my 3rd scoop of fish he only filled up the spoon halfway. I am not the type to complain about something but I don't understand how someone does not know how to scoop food into a bowl. The Thai tea is also watered down unlike other locations I have been to."}
{"text":"Coming from Hawaii, I just had to try this place. It's kind of pricey but I just love the options they give. Ahi is previously frozen but to expected because it has to be shipped. I had the everything with the Ahi and sauce, it tastes amazing but seriously had to visit the porcelain God sooner than expected. Be prepared peeps! Overall food is great and will return."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My favorite stop on a busy those busy weekends. Fish is fresh...and they have octopus! Yum...one of my favs! A little pricey...but so very good!"}
{"text":"I love the idea of this place, and how it's a decent amount of food equivalent to a nice sushi roll but for a lower price. I give it 3 stars because the scoops of toppings were so small. I asked for edamame and probably got 10 small pieces of it. The fish was also very minimal but there was enough in proportion to the rest of the toppings. Overall, this place was good but I was a little disappointed. I looked at the menu on Yelp beforehand and realized when I got there that the prices had gone up by about $2. But it's okay, I am still glad I checked this place out."}
{"text":"Great poke place with an easy order counter and options. I came durning lunch and it was busy but still didn't take long. I ordered the brown rice with tuna and all the toppings and the portions were big and very tasty."}
{"text":"I just happened to be driving by and it caught my eye. I love sushi . I had no idea what to expect. I like to get sushi because I don't always have to have a rice option. I was thrilled that it had a lighter option with salad instead of having to have rice. I opted for the salmon and the tuna and paid the extra dollar. I really didn't know what to expect as far as adding all the toppings I like. And I took the young man's recommendation for my sauces. And they gave me a dollar off because it was my first time :-). My first fight was awesome! Better than initially. I ate every bite I will be back!"}
{"text":"Hooray! They have a poke place in Gilbert! Finally ahipoki has come to this side of town!  Very nice and clean looking place, just what you would expect from a franchise such as Ahipoki. The customer service was great here, the only thing I had a problem with was the quality of some of the ingredients.   That being said, when I asked for rice, the late took my rice and smashed it into the bottom of my tray. I was kinda like \"whoa what the heck!\" but i wanted to see if the employee even knew what she was doing, but she didn't. Rice is supposed to be nice and fluffy, not lathered on the bottom of my bowl like it's cement.   So that was very odd to me. Not only that, but the rice was actually kinda mushy.   Maybe it was just my experience that day or something but it's not like it was busy. However I'll have to go again and update my review.   Tips: 1) If you want more out of your bowl, ask for one of those square plastic salad to-go container and ask for your rice, they usually put a lot more rice in those 2) if there's some things that allow to get extra without you paying for it, get more 3) the citrus and spicy house sauces are the best, but you can also ask for the other ones on the side for you to try without holding up a busy line  4) if you like wasabi, ask for it on the side so that you can mix it with soy sauce just like at Sushi places. If not, you're more likely to bite into a huge globe of wasabi, and that ain't ever good!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd encounter with Pokebowls...and this was place was just okay in comparison to the unnamed first.  It was my husband's 1st time trying it and I  had to apologize, this is not the best. I think more crunchy options for toppings would have helped all the mushy texture."}
{"text":"Recently craved Poke and found one in Scottsdale. Being as I lived in Ahwatukee, I was prepared to take the drive. I decided to check their website last minute and found out they had just opened a branch in Chandler! Everything was good, as expected, though I am keeping this review at 4 stars because I believe they could improve on the way they assemble the bowl. Comparing it to the way I've had it in California, their assembly makes it harder to consume properly. Their ingredients are stacked, rather than placed side by side, so I ended up having to dig through and eat one ingredient after the other. The cashier / manager was very hospitable and I even thanked him for having a branch nearby. I wish I could have given him this piece of constructive criticism. Hopefully, he'll get to see this review and be open to this simple suggestion. I hope these guys continue to be successful, as I'd love to have them stay in the area."}
{"text":"I had a great Poke bowl here tonight.  Salmon was cut perfectly, and everything tasted super fresh.  The employees were super friendly.  My new office is right around the corner I will be here frequently!"}
{"text":"I go here a lot, as in I make excuses to be in the area so I can come here. I always get avocado and yellowtail added as I believe they are worth the extra fee. Sometimes the lines here get rather lengthy but if you are a sushi poke lover this is a great place to get a customized bowl. I have never gotten sick, seen the manager take the temperature of the food on a regular basis and the restaurant is clean. Make sure one of your scoops of meat is the tuna luau as that is the pre-marinated tuna that is the tradition poke."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm pretty sure I'm addicted to poki. Staff is always friendly. Wait can be long if you come during their peak time, around noon to 1:30ish. I always get the same combo, and it always fresh and made to order."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Chandler from Hawaii. So to find something like this is incredible!  We enjoy it and highly recommend it to all."}
{"text":"This was my first time to an Ahi Poke and I was very hesitant. I mean..  come on?!? Fast casual-ish sushi/seafood??? The moment I walked in the door I was warmly greeted and then given a full explanation of the menu and the many options available! Where to start? White or brown rice? The proteins? Avocado??? To top it all off, the manager, Drew, came by to check on my order since he heard it was my first visit to Ahi Poke. The food, service, and selections were on point. Defenitely will return!"}
{"text":"I headed here in the middle of the afternoon on a busy convention-filled Saturday so I could obtain a healthy supper to stash in my hotel fridge. I was lucky enough to not have a line behind me, so the awesome guy behind the counter was able to take his time and explain my options. I went with a regular, two-scoop bowl with a brown rice base, ahi tuna and shrimp with house sauce, and a whole bunch of other toppings. I was in awe of how much he squeezed inside that bowl, but he managed to get the lid on and it stayed on for the trek back to my hotel!  The end result was a meal that looked pretty and tasted delicious. The addition of a packet of soy sauce, included in my bag, was great along with everything else. Whenever I am downtown again, I will definitely keep this place in mind."}
{"text":"I've been to the Scottsdale location a couple times and I'm happy they finally have a location that's a lot closer to where I live.. This place is nice and clean.. I like getting the half salad and half rice with spicy tuna and salmon combination .."}
{"text":"This is a brand new place and amazing.  It can be intimidating if u haven't been to a place like this.  Think about your first time at Subway... Except the food was great.  Lots of fun and good value.  Ask for samples, they want you to be happy.  Great staff.  Don't hesitate to come here Yelpers!"}
{"text":"While swarms of young people were walking the sidewalks in search of Poké balls, I was navigating the streets of Chandler heading here in search of delicious, fresh pok? bowls.  And I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Great new place.  Definitely will be in the rotation. Service was helpful and place was clean"}
{"text":"Our dinner options were burger or sushi. We went for poke. Even as I was diving into my bowl I thought to myself this was the right choice. Even as I finished my bowl I thought better than a burger! What? Who am I?   I get easily overwhelmed with too many choices, don't put me in front of a donut counter if you are in a hurry, 'this could take awhile' is something my boyfriend says often. But I didn't have a problem here. Everything was fresh and delicious. My bowl creation was perfect for me. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"SOO GOOD!! The staff was really friendly and it was my first time here and I didn't know anything!!! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This is the BEST poke I have had the pleasure of consuming, hands down. I love the ability to order the \"half and half\" to create my own sashimi salad! I've been to other establishments that serve poke and none offer the variety of fresh poke nestled on a bed of your favorite add-ons."}
{"text":"Was very good I recommend it for a healthy alternative for burgers and fries.  Had the tuna and salmon was quite fresh."}
{"text":"Definitely not my favorite Poke stop but it was good. The main thing I didn't like was the portion size. It was so much smaller than ghe other poke places I've been to, while still being the same price."}
{"text":"So this place almost has it all right... the decor is very clean and modern. It's almost an industrial feel. Everything is prepared right in front of you in, and the food prep area is well kept. The workers don't seem to be to excited about their jobs but they are friendly enough. Most importantly they are efficient and keep the waiting down. I got the regular bowl with tuna and salmon, over rice with most of the toppings. The fish was fresh. I went with the house sauce and it's good. Not over powering but good. They added a crab salad as one of the toppings. I had never had that on a poke bowl before. I'm not sure it went with the bowl but it was good. I added avocado to my bowl and it was 10.50 - a little pricey but not unreasonable. The best thing about this place was the customers. Every walk of life was in there young old, hipster, cowboys, it was amazing to see. My one major suggestion is to change the music - it was horrible - rave like music at 11:30 am on a Sunday is not the best."}
{"text":"Just came to check this place out and thought that the portions were pretty small, but after eating, I found it to be very filling. I got the regular sized Poki bowl with octopus and ahi. It was very very delicious. The service was wonderful."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients. Excellent taste.  Great pricing. Good portions. You cannot go out for sushi and pay these prices. Sometimes you just don't want all the fancy rolls. This definitely provides the variety and taste I was hoping for. Been looking for something like this to come to Gilbert, but hasn't yet. So glad I found this place searching on Yelp!"}
{"text":"OK thank goodness I found this place because I wanted a fresh salad and wanted sushi put it together creamy spicy all the veggies I love you!!!"}
{"text":"Allow me to say that I know NOTHING about poke except for the fact that it is very popular in Hawaii. I've passed by this establishment several dozen times, but I was a little hesitant, but today I decided to muster up some courage and get out of my comfort zone. When I walked in I told the man at the counter, and he gave me a quick run down basically stating that it was like sushi and a reference to something Japanese? My bowl was made with avocado, spicy tuna, brown rice, crab, and I believe sesame oil of some kind. It was pretty good, but maybe it is a taste that is acquired over time? Like I said this is something I know very little about, and  I might have to try it again down the line. I will say that the customer service was great, and the guy at the counter wasn't rushing me and seemed to genuinely enjoy guiding me in my poke journey. Overall it was good experience and perhaps I will come back in the future."}
{"text":"Best poki restaurant in town. A lot of choices, can't wait for them to open in Gilbert"}
{"text":"My favorite poke bowl in the Valley so far! I love the choice of toppings. Stay away from the Thai Tea, doesn't taste right and it's super expensive."}
{"text":"This pace is so yummy. I like that they have lots of veggie options to add to the bowl. I also feel you get a good portion size"}
{"text":"Good Poke, especially their salads. When they take the greens and mix them with the sauces, it's a more complete dish. This place does that"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere.  It has a very 'Portland' look.  They have good signage regarding how to build your bowl.  There are lots of extra add-on options which can hike up the price.  Wish they had signature bowls listed.  It's possible they do offer them but I didn't ask.   It was nice that they offered samples of the fish before you decide.  On the tables they had a sheet to fill out for 50% off next visit.  You have to hand it to them and get a physical coupon for next time.  My wife and daughter loved it.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is due to it not being table service."}
{"text":"Great concept. Food was very fresh and the salad was delicious. It's the Chipotle concept but with sushi. Staff seemed a little over whelmed with the huge line etc.....I am sure they will hammer this out. Not the friendliest and the reason I gave four stars. If you want tasty fast food that is healthy this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"FIVE STARS Joyce W. truly changed my life for the better when she introduced me to Ahipoke Bowl. I'm honestly addicted, so addicted that I come all the way from the West Valley for it. Ahipoke bowl, is really cool because you get to pick all your options and you get to see the staff put it together.  You can get salad, rice or both (half & half). They also have a brown rice option for you health freaks out there. I love that they have so many types of seafood and sauces for hundreds of combinations you can put together. They've got ice cream macarons for dessert too!  I also love that the staff has always been really friendly and inviting. Leaving Ahipoke, although you're SUPER full, you still leave feeling pretty great since it's a healthy option. If there was a location in the West Valley, I'd be there probably 3-4 times a week!"}
{"text":"I was really bummed!): On my way home from work I tried to call and place an order to go at this restaurant. I called 45 min before it closed and did not get an answer. I then tried 30 min before and 25. I walked in 15min before they closed. I hate to be the person that comes in right before closing but I thought hey 15min before closing and I am ordering to go I should be okay. I waited at the ordering station for 5 minutes and a women and man came from the back. Once we locked eyes I said hello and smiled and I just received a bank stair in return. They both put their gloves on and stared at me. I awkwardly told them what I would like to order assuming that is what they were waiting for. One of the items I asked for was yellow belly. The gentleman informed me that he had already put it away for the night. I asked if that meant it is in the back or if they were out. Instead of getting a reply he rolled his eyes walked to the back without saying anything and brought it out. I only rate this a 2 star only because the food is amazing! But the customer service is so horrible... I wont be back to this location. I have worked in the food industry way back when and even if someone came in one minute before we closed I have never treated anyone like that."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times and love the concept and have had a lot of good experiences. In my most recent visit I got some skanky pieces of tuna and will not be back. Nothing worse then poke that isn't fresh."}
{"text":"Stopped by to try since I live super close! I got mine Togo since I just had a new baby. Flavors were really good but there was a lot of sauce and it wilted the lettuce abbot by the time I got home (not far, power ranch) I will defiantly  be back though! The Thai iced tea and fruit drink is really good. They charge $1.50 for a small scoop of Avocado but the price overall is very good!"}
{"text":"Unless you are starving or have an incredibly large appetite,  I suggest choosing the Regular portion.  You get tons of rice. and two or three quarter cup size scoops of fish. Avocado is extra but they don't tell you that until you checkout."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect and with that came the confusion of what to order. I can't wait to come back and try more combinations. The spicy tuna was delicious, as was their seaweed salad. Next time I will get less rice and more toppings!"}
{"text":"I just went in to this place for the first time. I ordered the half salad, half rice, with a scoop of the unseasoned ahi, and a scoop of the marinated ahi. I got all the toppings. The young man helping me out was very patient and pleasant. At the end I handed him $2.00 cash, and asked for the rest to be put on the card. It turned out I did not have enough in my account. I was so embarrassed and apologized, right before I tried to run out of there. The other young man that helped with the transaction stopped me and told me to take the food anyway. I got home 5 minutes later, and this is sooo good. I didn't really expect much, but the quality of these ingredients is outstanding and the service...well, I can't say enough about the customer service at this place. Tonight you have won yourself a customer for LIFE. I will be dinning at your establishment on a regular basis. And don't worry, I will have money from now on When I come in. Thank you, by the way, for being so discreet when you caught me on my way out and gave me my food. I am very impressed with Ahipoki."}
{"text":"I guess I would say that I got what I asked for, and I need to learn how to ask for better.    What I ordered:  White rice, scallops and kimchi shrimp, house spicy sauce, ginger, cucumber, and green onion.  The white rice and the cucumber sucked a lot of the flavor that I'm sure was there otherwise.  The kimchi shrimp was delicious and I could eat that ginger by the crate.  I think the house spicy sauce may have helped to retain some of the flavor, but otherwise it was pretty bland.  It wasn't bad, it just didn't leave me wanting more.  It's the sort of place I'll go back to under the right circumstances but not a place I'll suggest when trying to decide where to dine out.  Service was good, the place was clean.  Price a bit overmuch but everything is more expensive these days."}
{"text":"I was so excited that they opened a location near where I live!   I received an email with a $5 coupon on a regular bowl or salad notifying me of the new location.   I like the mixed salad better than the river. But that's just my opinion!   The octopus is my new favorite. We just got back from Hawaii and ate a lot of poke! Surprisingly the poke is way better here than in Hawaii!  The girl that made my salad was being very light on the add on's like cucumber, seaweed, fish eggs, and brussels sprouts. The other location packs it in. It was still delicious though!"}
{"text":"This was my first and will be my last visit fore Poke here. Way more expensive than other Poke spots for less food. To bad sense there are really no options for a good poke bowl out here but I rather drive to a better poke spot than settle for this place!"}
{"text":"So, when someone said new in Chandler and Ray, I assumed by 101... anyways, after referrals from group \"Living Chandler\" on  FB, We tried it out.. Also, my health is at a concerning level and need to find great / healthy food...   I got Brown Rice with side onions (didn't see Crab like menu says), With Albacore and Spicy Tuna, Spicy Creamy sauce, Green Onions, Masago, Daikon Sprouts, roasted seaweed and crunchy onions..   I am a Lobster, King Crab, Japanese Scallop fan to the MAX... So Sushi and most fish to me are , just ok, with the exception of what is involved in the sushi, etc..   This was pretty good and very healthy, what the Dr ordered for sure, and the flavors of the fish were fresh, and spicyness level, just right. I tried some of the Wifes Ahi, and Yellow tail also as fresh as local Sushi places, and the added ingredients just brought the dish together for me.   Green and Thai Tea were both refreshing, would order again, since I dont know how to make GOOD green tea at home, I am missing something in the preparation..   Owner came out and was greeting the customers and getting their opinions, really nice guy and we will be back here for sure...   Trying to give up gluten, and dairy etc is a pain to find alternatives beside just salad, and this place hit the spot.. Lil bit of a drive for me but i will hit this place more often for sure !!"}
{"text":"It was very busy for lunch on a Wednesday. Here are my pros and cons. Overall, it was very average and if I wasn't in the area already I wouldn't make a special stop to eat here. I ordered the regular bowl with brown rice, spicy tuna and octopus. My friend ordered the large with double tuna and yellowtail, half and half with brown rice and salad.  Pros: -Quick service -Well decorated space, clean and modern  Cons: -Excruciatingly loud EDM music for about 20 min before they finally realized they should turn it down -Very skimpy on the protein and toppings (crab and seaweed salad) for my regular bowl -"}
{"text":"I loved this food joint healthy fast and easy!!!! And really convenient! I don't have to drive all the way to Scottsdale anymore !!"}
{"text":"Super great service and awesome recommendations for the staff made this experience a wonderful one. I was new to this type of food and the staff recommending things based on what I like in sushi made for a great meal and a fun experience. I would recommend this place if you enjoy sushi and something different all very fresh food and tasted great."}
{"text":"Five stars for the poke, but 3 for the macaron ice-cream for its size and price!   I get the large bowl with half salad and half brown rice, and you get three scoops of a protein, and you can choose from a wide variety of toppings to add! There are toppings like crab salad, seaweed salad, fish eggs and more, and only avocado is an extra charge! I love how fresh everything tastes, and their house dressing is my favorite! The employees were also super friendly and helpful, giving their advice on sauces and allowing us to sample some of the proteins. This is also a great location with lots to do around there like Harkins and Main Event.   Their macaron ice-cream sandwich was tasty, but it was half the price of the small bowl, and it was so tiny! I wish they'd lower the price on this since it's obviously shipped and not made in-house.   Overall, their poke bowls are delicious and an affordable and customizable way to satisfy your sushi craving!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see pokè came to AZ. So when the Scottsdale location opened I was happy happy. Unfortunately the drive was too far so we couldn't go often.  Then! One day all my dreams came true! I heard they were opening a Chandler location! So I could not wait until they opened.  Came here the day after their grand opening. It got packed fast. Food was very good. Service can be better but I can understand the chaos of all the people. Their wasabi is super strong! If you enjoy the burn feel free to mix it in like I did and you will get those random bites of surprise. Otherwise keep it on the side.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So good! I could eat this everyday for lunch! I just wish you could try the dressing before committing and a little less stingy on the toppings. I wish there was one in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Good quality poki bowl.  I had the salmon, and it was fresh.  Good customer service.  I liked the decor, and the food was healthy.  They let me have a sample of their thai tea because I wasn't sure if I wanted some or not.  It was good, but too sweet (trying to cut out some sugar)."}
{"text":"Wow!! This food is amazing!!  This is not your typical rice or salad bowl, this is in a whole new league of its own!! The bowl starts with lettuce or rice, or both, than pick your raw seafood and than the limitless ingredients...  it's so good and fresh, it's like eating sushi in a bowl."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the fresher options for raw fish in the valley. I'm fond of the options and how filling the food is, while being relatively healthy. This location is in the heart of downtown, next to the CVS.   Service: Awesome! They were super helpful and friendly. The lady behind the bar greeted me with a smile and was quick to answer any questions I had. The manager loaded me up with candy as it was Halloween.   Food: Fresh, light, and tasty. Poke is one of my favorite meals, and this place did not disappoint. I chose the smaller option and got two scoops of protein. I stuck with the ahi tuna and spicy tuna on a bed of white/brown rice. This whole meal is completely customizable. I then got a little bit of everything to top it off. I'm not sure how to choose, so I generally don't. But, recommendations: the seaweed salad and green onions always seem to go well with the raw fish.   Ambiance: There was plenty of seating which was great. In the summer, I imagine that the place will be packed.    Sometimes you want something hearty and warm, and sometimes you're in the mood for something a little lighter and fresher. If you still want a solid meal though, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"It wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad at all. The scoops are really tiny but you get a nice choice of toppings. I added on edamame, seaweed salad and extra cucumber. The poke itself was good but not amazing. I miss the days when Costco used to sell it and boy do I wish I lived in Hawaii and could just buy it at Safeway. Heck, I just wish I lived in Hawaii. Anyway, good but not great. I'll probably eat here again."}
{"text":"What a great place to sit and have something quick healthy and affordable.   Place might not be for faithful McDonald's eaters but for others who watch what they eat, it's a great alternative to food shopping or cooking."}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday, went back today.  This place is awesome and quick!  When I went yesterday there were no spots in the parking lot so I parked across and went in, had my food in less that 10 minutes.  Try this place out!"}
{"text":"We lived a couple years in HI, and were hesitant to try poke this far from the sea. When the core of your dish is playing-dice-sized cubes of raw fish, you want a place and employees who know what they're doing. We finally went, then went again a few days later, and I'm wondering how soon I can go again. It's outstanding!  For anyone new to poke: Think deconstructed sushi, in a laid-back, Chipotle-esque ordering and eating experience. You can try raw (also some cooked options) fish items without the sorta intimidating experience of a first time at a sushi bar.  They even let you sample stuff before you commit anything to your bowl. Chopsticks available but not required.   The half salad half rice option makes a fantastic meal, and is now my favorite way to go. Spicy house sauce is perfect. Getting the dried onions, sesame, and furikake at the end of the line adds a crunch to the bowl that keeps it from being mealy."}
{"text":"We had a less than stellar experience when we were at the grand opening of the Scottsdale location. But when we heard that a Chandler location was opening, we were so excited and decided to give it another try. That experience was a lot better, which leaves me to believe all the kinks were worked out and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. I had a half salad, half rice combo. The choice of fish was salmon, spicy tuna, and shrimp. I had the house sauce and really enjoyed it. The portions ended up being so big I shared my plate with my mom. It's a tad on the pricey side for lunch, but for how much you get and how tasty it is, I'd say I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by Ahipoki Bowl.  I have a deep love of poke. I was expecting Ahipoki to be fast-casual like chipotle. It was not. It was much more like fast food. The kitchen area was almost completely empty and unfinished looking - they really should have put up a visual barrier. We were there are 5pm on a Saturday and we were the only ones there. There were lots of staff milling around looking bored and joking around. The food was only served in to-go containers, and the portions were a bit off to me. The spicy tuna was like a mash, so I didn't try it. I had the plain tuna which was completely plain - no marinade. You pick a marinade and it's more like a salad dressing poured over the top. At $9-12 a bowl, this seemed ridiculously expensive for the atmosphere. We will not be going back, nor can I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"First time eating here and I must admit it was incredibly perfectly delish! I had half and half which was half brown rice and half salad. Had salmon and spicy tuna with imitation crab, fish eggs, etc. Everything was fresh and so good! You wont be disappointed. I had green tea for my drink and mango icre cream macarons for dessert as well. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Ate here the 1st time tonight and it was great. Tasted Fresh and all the ingredients had good flavor."}
{"text":"Completely out of Crab Salad during lunch rush and no to-go soy sauce packets?  Come on, man!"}
{"text":"Our first time ever here and trying Poki. We enjoyed it very much. If you love sushi but tired of all the rice, this is the spot."}
{"text":"This is a great experience. The food is fresh and tasty.  Like a bowl is sushi or sashimi. And the price is great. The servers guide you through ordering.   LOVE IT"}
{"text":"As an ahipoke bowl addict, I was excited to see they've opened a location 10 minutes from my office as I was already spoiled with having the Scottsdale location 10 minutes from my home. Well, made my first trip here today and I must say there is a noticeable difference in this location compared to Scottsdale.   First off, the building clearly used to be a drive-thru of some sort, which means there are only about 10 parking spots in the lot, not a huge deal, but its weird. You have to park in a the surrounding area and then walk over. I also noticed that the interior setup is really different, they almost seem crammed in the space where they're putting together your bowl compared to the layout of Scottsdale. But, onto the most important part - the food  I noticed the manager was standing behind the folks working the line and was helping them out, clearly a lot of brand new folks here just getting their footing. The man in front of me ordered half and half -which normally is half salad/half rice but he wanted half of each kind of rice. No big deal, obviously its a flat rate here, but the worker was so confused he had to leave the line and go ask the cashier if it was ok as the manager was helping someone else. Very odd, considering there was a line of 15 or so at that point to have the shut things down for such a mundane request. Moving on, my salmon looked like it was cut up using a butter knife, there was WAY too much sauce added leaving my salad and the fish soggy, and the lack of organization/confidence by the staff made the experience take about twice as long as the Scottsdale location.  If the food still tasty? Absolutely. But do they have some obvious growing pains to work out here? For sure. If you have a choice or you're on the fence about what location to hit up, Scottsdale is the only option at this point. Still, love the concept and the new spot will surely be a hit, once they've been open awhile and find their groove."}
{"text":"Ahipoki is a decent option if you're looking for a quick lunch in downtown Phoenix. The place looks very new - decor is modern and clean. The music felt a little out of place though: it was loud and more like club music rather than something you'd want to listen to during lunch. As for the food, I tried a half salad, had rice with the blazing salmon and luau tuna. The fish was well marinated and fresh tasting. The toppings were also fresh - I love that they have the red pickled radish. It's so good on rice. I tried a green tea too but it was weird. It was slightly milky. I would rather get my tea next door at Starbucks, but otherwise Ahipoki hits the spot."}
{"text":"Best lunch hands down!! I get a regular salad with tuna luau...don't recommend the salmon, it feels like you chew on it forever. The avocado is worth the extra money, and the crunchy onions add nice texture to it all. The best part is ordering a a macaron ice cream sandwich. They are pretty small but worth every penny!! The coffee one is my absolute favorite.   The only downside is the size of the location especially during a busy lunch rush."}
{"text":"I'm super excited to see how packed this location is! Great job! Now to add one to the Tucson market !! I can't get enough of the food, people, and atmosphere here! The two hour drive to have a taste of heaven is worth it!!"}
{"text":"Had great experiences in Scottsdale location but my god these guys are worse than Chipotle with scoops here in Chandler. Glad other places similar to this might open up and hopefully they will take note on this whole take some tuna back because they put a little more than a scoop in. Will def not be coming back to this location!!"}
{"text":"2nd time going to this place that was recommended by my sis n law ..she went to another location than this one. But they were really knowledgeable about the good and drinks since I have food allergies...love this place after my hard and crazy workout at Eos!!!!"}
{"text":"This location is awesome the food is really good the staff is very helpful and happy to see his I think this business will definitely flourish here good work thank you"}
{"text":"Discovered this place less than a month ago and have already gone six times for the large all-greens and salmon. I can't express my love and gratitude enough."}
{"text":"Imagine Chipotle but with Sushi -  High quality ingredients and great service,  Teh choices and flavors were all spot on!    Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Kinda boring looking place with medium friendly staff.  The poki bowl itself wasn't bad but not great either.  Pokedon off of McClintock is way better!"}
{"text":"You are what you eat. In that case, I think I'm either a mermaid or a fish by this point.  I absolutely LOVE Ahipoki! The owner is the sweetest guy ever and they run great promos on their Facebook and Instagram. They even feature photos from Yelpers!   Although I normally eat multiple small portions throughout the day, poke is where I go big (because I ain't going home!). Their large is perfect because you get three scoops of fish. I love fish. I think I can eat half the ocean's worth of fish in one sitting. Here at Ahipoki, the fish is so fresh, Nemo and Dory practically hops into your bowl! I always get my poke with avocado even if it costs more because you can't get poke without avocado.  #fact  I love their Scottsdale location and I love their Chandler location even more! Best of luck in your second location, Ahipoki! You have a fangirl for life! *smooches*"}
{"text":"Q:  What does the pope eat during lent?  A:  Holy mackerel!  A fourth Ahipoki review?  You betcha!  One day I will go to all six locations [probably not but oh well]!  Anyways, what can be said that hasn't been said before?  No matter which location you go to in the valley, consistency is the same.  You're still getting the same fresh fish, the same healthy leafy greens, and the same great service.  I think their crab salad and seaweed salad have a little something extra that other poke places don't have that makes it extra addicting.  Ahipoki is the only place I'll allow myself to get two scoops of crab salad.  And since Ahipoki was the first poke place in Arizona, I always have a fondness for them.  My normal go to sauce is their Creamy Spicy sauce.  Get yourself a bowl with a tropical drink!  Even better, take that tropical drink home and add rum to it.  Aw yis!"}
{"text":"I'm new to Poke. Fresh, simple, great variety.  The place is clean and modern. Staff and food was great. Prices are very reasonable. This is basically a Chipotle style with sushi style fish."}
{"text":"Ahipoki is honestly my favorite poke joint in the valley. The company and its quality of food is 5+++ stars for Arizona. This poor review is solely based on the incredibly discourteous service, which surprises me considering some reviews i saw highlighted the customer service.   I normally go to the Chandler location, because the service, the food, and the environment is A1. This was my first time at this location and it was rather annoying. It started out great but immediately went downhill after Step 1 of building my poke bowl. While i was telling her what protein i wanted, she was constantly distracted--looking towards the kitchen where i had noticed another coworker was messing around with her from a distance. She continued this while my friend was also telling her his protein . Shortly after, we'd moved on to the toppings and as I was about to tell her my 1st topping, I KID YOU NOT, she made a weird screeching sound and RAN OFF towards the kitchen. Right in the middle of preparing my bowl. She literally just left.   We stood there for a good minute or two before a different girl came out to finish our bowl. At this point I was extremely dissatisfied and upset as a customer. We finished our order, paid, and sat down. Not a second after sitting, the same girl who rudely left us in the middle of preparing our bowls screamed yet again as she was messing around with two other coworkers who were seemingly off the clock and sitting at a table.   There truly didn't seem to be a manager/ supervisor on the clock during this visit, and it's unfortunate that the employees felt that it was appropriate to behave and treat customers in such a way."}
{"text":"Great concept; healthy, good portions, etc. a little outta the way but manager is  s. sctdl awful & worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"Still my favorite poke chain in PHX. The ingredients are simple and consistently fresh."}
{"text":"First time trying this Poke place, and let me say that it is very good. Fish tasted fresh, restaurant was clean and staff was very friendly. I'll be frequenting this place often if they continue to perform at these standards. I chose to do a large half and half with brown rice. Rice tasted fresh, greens were fresh and the fish was great. I feel it's a great price for what you get. The amount of toppings for your Poke bowl is quite impressive as well. If you're hesitant about dropping in, I urge you to do so because you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Did not like the food. To pricey. Service was good. They tried to help me like it but not a chance"}
{"text":"Food is great! There's an open water drain by the fountain drink station. They always have a cone over it. I think it's is stinking up the place.  2017-01-27: I think they fixed that drain smell issue."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Everything's always fresh & they have a great selection. The prices are fantastic for both the quality and quantity of food that you get. Haven't tried anything here that I haven't liked!"}
{"text":"I ordered a large bowl and their fish scoops are tiny and I mean TINY! Also, no vegetable selection, just ginger and some onions. All the rest costs EXTRA.   Overpriced, tiny portions, no selection. Terrible poke place."}
{"text":"So freaking good. Completely changed my mindset for raw fish. The more you get the better the flavor combo is! Definitely will be back!;-)"}
{"text":"Poke Bowl in Chandler? How can I not be here!  I was so excited to try EVERYTHING and decided to order a large size poki bowl that comes with 3 different items: spicy tuna, octopus and Tuna Luau that came with half rice/green salad covered with garlic soy mirim, green onion, seaweed, crispy onion, and chili flakes. I was disappointed that the spicy tuna and octopus were too chewy. However, tuna luau was absolutely delicious and well seasoned. The garlic soy mirim sauce is also very tasty.   Staffs were friendly and helpful. Restaurant is organized, clean and welcoming. I'll definitely come back here again to try something different...but I probably will not be ordering the spicy tuna and octopus again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and super friendly staff make this place a must visit. I drive all the way across town to visit this location. Their bowls are outstanding!!"}
