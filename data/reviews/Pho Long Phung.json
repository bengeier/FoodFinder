1st time to try the Bun Cha CA (Fish Cake Noodle Sour Soup) ~ super good ~ must try!!"}
{"text":"Good restaurant in eastern part of Montreal.
We order a pho and a fish soup. The pho was good. Not the best in Mtl IMO cause a little salty for my taste but far from the worst either. The fish soup was excellent with a lot of ingredients in it like okra, eggplant, fish, shrimp, squid and more. My kid had a general Tao and we would not recommend this dish in this restaurant cause it was not much crispy.

The Vietnamese roll we're very good and tasty.

Finally, the 3 Colors dessert was good. Again, not the best in Mtl but still good with homemade jelly. 

The service and price were very good.

I would recommend this restaurant if you want to try a new Vietnamese place in town for a change."}
{"text":"Food is delicious!!! We walked in very hungry today with a group of 10 people. The service was prompt and the food was delicious! We ordered just about one of something on the menu."}
{"text":"This is a good one! We are traveling Quebec from California. Have been having enough tim Horton's so need to find something else. The quality is as good as those in LA! The waitress and owner are very nice!  And they speak Cantonese 

????Tim Horton's. ?????????????"}
{"text":"WOW! This was my first time trying Pho.. you must come here.
This is such a humble restaurant. 
The service was entirely amazing. 
We were greeted by the friendliest woman and her children helped serve us water and fortune cookies while we waited for our TAKE OUT. 

The Pho was so good I ordered a large (~$10) and well worth the price. 
For the service, the food and the overall humbleness, this restaurant deserves five stars. 
Please come here to support this business!!"}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen, I have truly found the best Pho place in Montreal!

No really, this is a hidden gem, and it is quite new for too many people to know about it. The location first looks like a hole in the wall, but as you enter, it feels cozy when greeted by the lady in the front who is super friendly and helpful. 

I ordered the Bun Bo Hue which was $11.50 and it was the most delicious bowl of BBH I ever had. The ingredients were extremely fresh, and there was a good portion of meat, vegetables and noodles. It was spicy, but it was also flavorful so to me, that was the perfect combination.

The main chef, is the husband of the waitress lady that greeted me, out of the blue, he came out at the end of my meal, and asked me if I wanted more noodles because I looked like his son! I said no thanks... but he insisted, so he went back and cooked me another small bowl of BBH! It was a very memorable and friendly experience and I will be back again. I mean, who does that to a random guest? The family that runs this Pho place is so nice!"}
{"text":"Wow so I ordered take-out from this place with my girlfriend as we were going to take it back to our Airbnb to eat. So as we were waiting the staff gave us water to drink and gave us a few fortune cookies. Like wow that's so nice, I've never had that good of service just to WAIT for our food. So we ended up ordering pho, which I always wanted to try. And woowwww it was soo goood. Even though I had nothing to compare it to I think it was amazing for my first time trying pho. We got the one with the well done meat and it was really good. This place gets 5 stars because of the service and how nice the staff was. Defiantly recommend if you want a cheap delicious meal!"}
{"text":"The restaurant I have no idea how to pronounce their name lol. Well what can I say I was impressed I took a very simple plate I was a bit press for time so I just chose randomly and really enjoyed it. This place is one of the reasons why I love yelp never would of found them other wise . I want to come back and see what else they have my soup was not only better then I expected it was huge I had to take the rest home. Amazing service I felt very welcomed if your near by give it a try"}
{"text":"Great traditional Vietnamese food, quick and friendly service with a good price. From a good selection of food on the menu to serving it you can expect great things, I would come again with my family and friends."}
{"text":"First time eating here and our group were all thoroughly impressed with the food. I had the pho with rare beef and tendon, and the tendon was amazingly soft and delicious. Another of the dishes we had was the Bo Koh which had an amazing flavour and melt in your mouth beef. I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the mood for a good bowl of Pho."}
