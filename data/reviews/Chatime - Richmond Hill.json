{"text":"Worst cha time. They either always mix up the drinks or out of tapioca.

I went there for the first time a couple of weeks ago... during the order, I was told that they were making the tapioca and would take half an hour..... my second visit today, I ordered 4 drinks with tapioca. Must've waited for almost 10 minutes before I was told AGAIN that there wasn't any tapioca left.

I honestly don't understand how a bubble tea shop is always out of tapioca?"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great location at Hillcrest Mall, and I love the addition of Bake Code which almsot always has generous amounts of samples! Not the fastest Cha Time service though."}
{"text":"Chatime is definitely my favourite bubble tea place. 
My favourite drinks are the Pearl Milk tea, milk tea smoothie, and matcha tea latte. I always get pearls (tapioca) with my drink! 

Hillcrest used to be my favourite location but after the renovation it's gotten really busy. To be honest, it still look the same. They also need more chairs and tables. Right now there's only about three tiny tables to sit down on.

{"text":"Like any other Chatime, bubble tea is good. Service is terrible, waited 30+ minutes for bubbletea, employees don't know what they're doing. People behind us got their orders before us. They also gave the wrong drink to many people ahead of us. Made excuses and did not take accountability for their mistakes. Poor customer service -- would rather drive a little further to go to Commerce gate for their Chatime, or go to Sharetea which has great bubble tea as well! Bake code was expensive -- innovative flavours for some breads, but some you could buy at a Chinese bakery for half the price."}
{"text":"Worst place for bubble tea ever. Been here 3 times. First time it took me forever to get my order. Had to repeat 3 times and it took a while to make. Went here again, didn't get my order right. And the way they handled their bread was extremely unsanitary. I don't like too much fingers on my food. Third time was probably the nastiest. Someone accidentally grabbed my order, stabbed a straw in it and drank it. We finally realized and he gave it back to the barista. They ripped the sticker of the lid and re applied a new one and gave it right back to me. That's pretty fucked up and so disgusting in so many ways. Never go to this one. Make an extra trip to the one at commerce gate. This could've been anyone."}
{"text":"Came here around noon on Sunday 

Pros
-OK coffee
-Clean

Cons
-Matcha croissant tasted like crap 
-Did not honour yelp check in promotion 
-Slow service/long wait

Would not recommend"}
{"text":"This is my favourite bubble tea chain and the fact that they have bake code is even more fabulous. However their service needs major improvement ASAP. 

Why do I need to wait 15 mins for bbt? 
I ordered more than 20 dollars worth of baked goods and was supposed to get a five dollar voucher. The workers didn't give it to me so I had to go back and pick it up. No apology whatsoever. 
The guys do not know what their breads are get so they were asking me for the names of it so they could ring it in. 
Pretty brutal service but the food is good so if you can overlook that, this place is good."}
{"text":"Big fan of chatime drinks, my go-to is roasted brown sugar milk tea. I really wanted to try bake code for a while now. I got the salted egg yolk croissant, matcha red bean round, earl grey flute, matcha filled croissant, chocolate croissant and the cheese danish. Everything was just OKAY, I think the best thing was the matcha red bean round and the earl grey flute. The only things I didn't get to try were the cheese tarts which had a very liquid filling and the Millie crepes which were $$$. I also had the rock salt iced coffee which wasn't that good, it reminded me of gong cha's milk foam but not as salty. 

Overall service was good but if its your first time don't go crazy like me, stick with their most popular items like the earl grey tea flute which is quite big by the way and the matcha red bean round. Also stick to the Chatime drinks. They have a top 10 menu to help if it's your first time."}
{"text":"One of the only Chatimes in the area! Since I worked in the mall, this place is really convenient for me. Because I'm trying to cut down on sugar (lol New Year resolutions) I don't come here as often. When I do, the service is great. Keep in mind that this can be a busy location as it is within a pretty small mall and nearby several high schools. 
One complaint I have based on my visits is how the payment and Vicinity systems are continuously slow or down. When I went to redeem a reward, I was told that the Vicinity system was unable to redeem my birthday drink. However, the employee then said it was okay and offered me a free drink. I got a Matcha latte. It was mediocre.
Would come back because of the better service in comparison to other major bubble tea shops."}
{"text":"I went to another chatime two days before coming to this one, for the Mango Twist drink because it was 50% off on Yelp for checking in. Little did I know, neither this one and the other I went to have the recipe for Mango Twist. I was very disappointed. It seems like it's a scam. Luring people in for 50% off Mango Twist, yet they don't offer it at their stores. The only reason I'm giving this a two star is because the manager at this location was kind enough to offer the QQ Mango Juice for half the price."}
{"text":"This location has improved immensely since it originally opened early December. Although the service may not be as fast as the other locations in Ontario, the drinks are well worth the wait. The service has also improved a lot; I remember the employee serving me, Daisy, was apologetic for the wait and guaranteed that my drink would be done right as she was right! My Chatime orders are always done to perfection and I've noticed that they taste better than many of the other locations I've been to. Will definitely come back to this location more often."}
{"text":"Slow. God awful slow. Even with what seems like 4 employees the wait time is 25minutes. Is this the training center for newbies??"}
{"text":"Damn you chatime, you had to be closer to me and add a bake code to tempt me more. 

What else is there to say? The drinks are great, I love the house milk tea, the oolong milk tea, the list goes on and I honestly do think their grass jelly is the best. There must be addictive elements in it that make me want more. 

I recently tried their mango juice with green tea.. Also very good! 

Bake code is generally delicious, but the review loses a point because it's so damn expensive for a bakery. I've tried their cake slices at another bake code before and they were definitely underwhelming.. Something you'd get at a loblaws bakery. 

Depending on which staff are working, the service pretty good overall."}
{"text":"NEW CHATIME AND BAKECODE ALL IN ONE? I'm there!

Sooooo hillcrest has definitely gotten a facelift since I saw it last, and I was glad the chatime was right at the entrance of the mall, near hudson's bay (which looks stunning by the way). This chatime is fairly large, probably because there's a bake code too. There's half of the store, which is asian bakery style- you go around, grab your shit and pay for it. Most of the bread there is worth it.. you won't find a similar taste anywhere else. I definitely had to go for the fresh mentaiko bread (tastes like sushi/flying fish roe on a baguette, I swear!) ever since trying it at the yelp elite chatime event. Freshly baked, it's absolutely delicious and well worth the $5. The other breads and buns are also so fresh, warm and yummy! Soooo good and satisfying. 

The drinks are consistent with any other chatime drinks but their grand opening BOGO deal has pre-determined 'free' drinks (so you can't just pick any drink). They are also extremely packed, so people in the back making the bubble tea are forced to come to the front to take orders, which they're obviously unfamiliar with. The wait was quite a while, but for bake code, it was damn worth it!! 

There's also this huge glass window thing where you can see the guy making your bread. Nice! I'd definitely come back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"A Chatime with a specialty bakery attached?  Great combination!  I usually make it a point to stop here for my usual tea, but I can't leave without a baked item.  The Tiramisu is one of the best I have had, exceeding most Italian restaurants in flavour and presentation."}
{"text":"*****THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST LOCATION WITH BAD SERVICE AND EMPLOYEES NOT KNOWING WHAT THEY'RE DOING!!!!

I would give it no star if there was an option! Take a few mins to read my story and you will certainly understand why! 

I've always been a Chatime fan since it firstly opened and I have over 40ish + vicinity points at Chatime (that shows how much purchases I have and enjoy their drinks). But this time, it's just disappointment on disappointment which when I emailed Chatime afterwards stating to them about the issue, I got ignore multiple of times and didn't seem to care!!

Went to visit this location on a weekday around 3ish pm, there was 2 short lines already, one purposely stating bakery and coffees only and other one I assumed it was for Chatime drinks. There were only 2 customers in front of me. I waited in line for over 15 mins until my order was taken. They ONLY accept cash now since they don't have the machines set up yet.

I walked around the bakery, they're breads are more on the pricey side. However, there's different unique kinds of breads which you can't purchase elsewhere. They set up small baskets of sample bread so you can taste which one you like before buying. We took at least 30 mins walking around the small bakery side eating bread. 

Since it's been over 30 mins and my order still wasn't ready yet, I decided to approach the cashier and ask. She seems confused to what she is doing and where my order is. I saw the 2 customers in front of me got their order already, but I'm still waiting after at least 4 customers get their orders. The cashier looked like in panic mode as there were over 7 drinks made sitting on the counter but she just didn't know who's order was who's and was TOTALLY lost. OH yea, her face turn paled and lost. 

At this point she is just asking customers who stood around the counter what they ordered and just giving ready drinks to them. I saw her give a customer a drink which had a sticker with the matching number as my receipt and the customer took it, but it into her bag and told the cashier it's the wrong size! THEN WHY DON'T YOU ASK FOR THE DRINK BACK!!??! So she gave them my drink so I told her and all she did was go to the back and make me a new one. so 40 mins for a drink, not worth my time!

This new location is just really unorganized and their staff are not properly trained to work!

Not coming back again until they hire better people and improve this problem!"}
{"text":"Always quick and friendly staff. Love this place when it comes to bubble tea. My favorites are brown rice green milk tea, taro milk tea with pudding and mango smoothie."}
{"text":"I really want to give a higher rating, but to be perfectly fair there is more room for improvement then not here.

I remember when this spot used to be a mmmmuffins (am I giving away my age now?) Currently it's a cha time which is located right beside the second mall entrance to the bay, and across of TD bank. From the outside the easiest entrance would be the mall entrance beside sporting life.

I would like to think I have been here often enough to see this location at it's best and worse. I do come to this mall a few times a week since there's a post office and a gym here, as well the mall is located close to a few large super markets. So when I'm in the mall I always find myself dropping by for some cha time.

They put out samples of their bake code goods which is a nice touch since their baked goods is a tad pricey. It's nice to be able to have a sample before spending $6 on a bun.

They have a good variety of drinks hot, cold, slush, coffee and so forth. They also have a pretty standard stock of bubble toppings (tapioca, aloe vera, grass jelly etc). I honestly have not had a horrible tasting drink from this place so far (roasted milk grass jelly tea anyone? It's tastier then it sounds!)

But where this place loses some street cred is the way they manage orders. 

It's a nice touch you can customize your sugar and ice level in your drink, but it can really slow down a line when someone doesn't know what they want. Sometimes i see a frustrated persons face when all they want is to pay for a bun.

Also i have seen times when the line thins out, but the person in the back isn't making drinks fast enough.

They are getting better as they seem to have some more consistent workers, and it seems like it could be a fun place to work (saw a few of the workers taking pix with santa over the holidays), i assume it was a team building thing as the store was closed for a few hours.

Overall the drinks are good, and if your in the mall its worth a try. Just be prepared for some mistakes here and there, but over all the workers seem to genuinely want to please.

We all make mistakes, so its fine if your not in a rush."}
{"text":"Soft open Yah!

Just opened today and Bake Code has only has select breads and buns out for purchase. 

Desserts and the Mentaiko baguette isn't out yet; but they said they will be adding them on as time progresses through their open. 

Staff is friendly and the store front is clean. Love the fact that here is a big window to watch them make and bake the bread. There is a back kitchen, but at least you get to watch them do part of the process out in the store front.  

There is a bit of a wait time to get your drink and order. But overall it isn't too long or crazy. 

No seating available right now, so stroller on to the food court if you want to seat while sipping your drink.  

They are located near the TD/HBC entrance."}
{"text":"Yay for a Bake Code and Chatime in one close to my house! Been here twice while making a visit to the mall. The store is tucked in Hillcrest mall near TD bank. This location serves all of Chatime menu and allows for a taste of Bake Code. However, as I haven't been to the North York location of Bake Code, I don't know how the variety compares. With that being said, offerings should be consistent with the other chains. With that being said, I am super disappointed with the location because they service is extremely slow and cashier is unknowledgeable. They should staff appropriately when you have 5+ customers waiting and standing in the middle of a mall walkway."}
{"text":"I was so excited months ago when I found out that they would be opening a Chatime/Bake Code in Hillcrest Mall (between TD and The Bay); perfect, right beside my house and I'd never have to go to the one at Commerce Gate as the parking lot is chaotic and smells like Korean bbq.

For the grand opening special they had buy one get one free (for a week) but the free drink was specified to be a regular sized grass jelly roasted milk tea, mango green tea...or one other option..how disappointing.

I'm not sure whether the screens rotate the menu but for the entire ~10mins I was standing there waiting for my drink..I did not see the complete menu pop up. If I was not familiar with the menu I would not have known what was available to me; they need a complete menu posted somewhere..

As for the Bake Code part of the shop, there is a large display case beside the cashier where you can see the bread being made..there is a cake section with some delicious looking pastries (not too expensive either...not sure about how they taste though).. there is a large selection of bread loaves and individual pieces.. though none of the bread is covered and with all the traffic from the mall passing by.. I'd be considered about the cleanliness as I imagine people breathing all over the bread and dust being everywhere.. kind of gross.

Overall, I was disappointed as I had imagined the store front to be bigger with some kind of seating area to hang out.. the store has no seats and closest would be over at the food court. My two drinks took quite some time to make as I guess there is only one person making drinks (compared to other Chatime stores).

PS. They currently take cash only.. but the vincity rewards is working."}
{"text":"It was nice to stumble upon a chatime in hillcrest mall today. Didn't realize one had opened up, it must have been a long time since I was last at this mall. Anyway, I was looking to get a hot drink (w no milk) here, and was surprised to find out they have a super limited selection of non-milk hot drinks... like maybe 2? I got the passion fruit hot tea, and was very surprised that this hot drink is the same price as the cold bbt drinks ($4.20 reg size)... So pricey for just hot tea. Also the baked goods under bake code are pricey as well... about $4 each for a dressed up croissant. As for customer service here, the female cashier here looked like she hates working there and/or looked pissed while taking my order. :T Not the best service I've had at a Chatime even though it's take out service."}
{"text":"I came here for the promotion around early December. Buy one get one free! Luckily they were also offering my fav drink for free. Two for the price of one! I gave them both to my good friend but I know the consistency of the drink itself is similar to other Chatimes.

I only had to wait for two others in front of me. But it seemed to take a while and there were at least 3-4 staff on hand. Maybe they were still new? It was slow... probably about 10 mins. Staff was nice though but probably not nice enough to make me come back (cuz it is out of the way) and I detest waiting.

Looked around the bakery area but thought the prices were too high. I'm sure they were delicious."}
{"text":"Decor: 2
Wait time: 1
Food: 3 

Everyone's been talking about this new Chatime/Bake Code location so I decided to give it a try on a Tuesday afternoon. 

The first thing that caught my eye was the expensive in store homemade bread inside a half opened window display.  If someone were to walk up from behind, they would definitely \"touch\" the bread with their jacket or purse.  The store is not big to begin with, so it made it even harder to walk because it was blocking the way.  I got bumped by other customers at least 5 times just standing there.

I went to check out their other pasties/desserts and wow they're pricey! They had the famous Mille Crepes cake but cost a fortune. Since I was there I just grabbed one to go along with a drink.

I'm giving the wait time one star and here's the reason why.  There were only 3 people waiting for drinks including myself. After 10-15 mins, the couple infront of me walked up to ask about the drinks.  Couple of the staff were just walking around to see if there were anything to do and chit chatting rather than making drinks.  When I saw that my drink was done, I was ready to give them my receipt with the order number but guess what? They put the drink down behind the display and kept on chitchatting! I thought  ok maybe it's their own drink, but 2 mins later, they finally decided to pick up the same drink and yelled my order number! I just don't get it...I really don't.

The Mille Crepes cake was very chewy I wonder if it's been sitting there for couple of days.  I haven't been feeling well ever since I ate it...no more pastries/desserts from them.   The drink was alright couldn't complain much.

I rather spend my money at Duo even if I don't get to collect Vicinity points."}
{"text":"Frequently runs out of bubbles, enough said.

This location has gone through the kinks of opening up, training new staff, re arranging the pastry set up for bake code and changed the line up twice, but what they haven't fixed yet, is making enough tapioca to last the day. Several visits throughout any time of day they always seem to be low or completely out and it takes 20 mins to make a new batch. They offer other toppings but then those run out so its just no toppings one time. I've heard the staff mutter to portion less or not care at all, because it's mainly the teens loitering the mall by sporting life keep this place going most days. 

Redeeming stars go to the tea, it's following recipe and custom ordering which remain consistent and the vicinity rewards. 

Buy 10 get one medium free, somehow keeps my loyal yet frustrated patronage while visiting this mall!"}
{"text":"4.5

I don't know why Hillcrest Chatime has a low rating, it's great!! 

First off, Chatime has got to be my all time favourite bubble tea place. I mean you can't beat the variety and taste. Not to mention the tapioca is perfectly chewy without being overly mushy. And how about that grass jelly roasted milk tea? FYI Chatime has limited editions t shirts right now made by Peace Collective which are available in all stores and say just that (Grass Jelly Roasted Milk Tea along with others adorning Chatime is bae, or Chatime anytime). 

Perhaps in the beginning Hillcrest Chatime was slow at operating, but now they are fast and efficient. They also just renovated their storefront for a sleek, modern appearance. Of course the quality of drinks is consistent throughout all of their stores. 

I recently tried the new holiday shimmering drinks. The hibiscus passion fruit tea was awesome! Such a pretty colour and tastes great too! It's light and refreshing and not overly sweet. It also has edible sparkles in it. The holiday drinks are available for limited time, and 10% of the purchase on the drinks goes to SickKids hospital which is amazing! 

Of course I'll be back at Chatime soon, probably tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I looooove taro and when I get bubble tea, that's my go-to choice but all of the ones I had didn't meet my expectations... until last night.

After a short walk around Hillcrest to burn off a dozen calories or so, I made the mistake of walking by Chatime... and placing an order... ironic isn't it? I opted for the taro milk tea with tapioca (less sugar and ice).

I didn't expect much, but as I stabbed the lid and began to srink, I was really surprised! I don't know if this is new for all Chatime shops but the taro milk tea had little chunks of taro in it - and that REALLY made it for me. The bubble tea was perfectly sweet.

From past experience, taro bubble tea was very grainy, presumably because they used the powdered version.

This was WAAAAAAY better.

I'm impressed. The only complaint for me is... those pastries from Bake Code are WAY overpriced. But that's beside the point."}
{"text":"This location inside Hillcrest Mall is a combination of Chatime and Bake Code. Here you can get both Taiwanese style baked goods and drinks.

My Roasted Milk Tea with Grass Jello is quite consistent with the other Chatime I had been to. 

With no line up on a weekday evening with just 1 customer aside from me, I ended up waited 5-10 minute for my order. I just wondering how it would have been if it is busy."}
{"text":"Update (12/20/2015): 
They accept credit/debit now.

There was a lot of confusion today as they only had the Bake Code express checkout line open. Even with a shorter line, it still took 15 minutes from lining up to receiving a drink. Removing another star from my rating.


Original (12/13/2015):
I've been waiting for Chatime and Bake Code to open up at Hillcrest for some time now. Chatime and Bake Code are so intense, put them together it just makes sense. The store is somewhat small, but there is a large window at the front where you can see the bread being made. They also provided samples of their delicious fruit-infused bread. The bread selection is quite extensive given the limited amount of space in the store. If you are only ordering for bake code, there is an express checkout line available.

We came to try the drinks as well. Again, given the small size of the store, the drink menu that's displayed on the screens isn't exhaustive. This means that you need to know what you want to order ahead of time. I only saw a small menu listed as well as their top 10 drinks. I ordered the grass jelly roasted milk tea (#2 on the list) and the honey dew milk tea. Both were really good. I really enjoyed the grass jelly. It was very soft, unlike the type you'd get in some of those grass jelly drinks.

The lineup was pretty crazy. Hopefully that was just an artifact of being their grand opening weekend."}
{"text":"Another chatime location. It's located inside Hillcrest mall; always has Bake code pastry at this location. 

They have the same menu as other chatime locations but there's no seating area at this location. Good for take out drink and walk around the mall."}
{"text":"If you don't want a line up this is the location to go to! Love their roasted milk tea with grass jelly.  I wouldn't get sugar as the grass jelly already has some sweetness to it."}
