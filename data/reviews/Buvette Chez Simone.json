{"text":"It's every bit as great as the 'hype' would indicate. From les accras de morue to the authentic chorizo (!) to the delicious cheese plates, this place delivers great French tapas-style cuisine that won't break the bank. It's look is typical of trendy Plateau restaurants but laid-back enough to have some wine, check some choices off the menu and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Great spot near Laurier.  Good chicken, better fries; cheeses and fried cod are excellent as well.  Wine by the glass is a good deal.  Try the Vin de France."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed a delicious charcuterie and cheese platter on a busy Monday night, nice selection of wines. For the earlier commenter complaining about the 2oz glasses... this is not uncommon and if you don't like it, just pass on it... It allows guests to try different wines ... The service was friendly and extremely professional - the place works like a well-oiled machine , it is no surprise why this place is so popular and well-liked. Prices good, music well selected, and atmosphere very warm. Only neg comment I can say (although not a deal breaker), is we found the seats at the bar a bit unstable and after 30mins, not that comfortable... but everything else makes up for it!  Ideal for a date or with friends."}
{"text":"Such a great gem of a place. Stumbled upon it without knowing how great it was. My sister and I sat tat the bar for several hours... Drinking beers, vodka soda, and eating cheese and olives. The bar staff were fun, informative, and friendly!!"}
{"text":"A ne pas manquer ! Restaurant de type tapas.    Les portions sont comprises entre 3 $CAD et 19 $CAD pour le jarret d'agneau confit sur son lit de purée. Excellent ! On y trouve des portions de charcuteries (Rillettes de canard, Rosette de Lyon, ...), de poissons (accra de morue, Maquereau en escabèche, ...), de fromage, de salade et rôtisserie.    Il y a du choix au niveau de la carte des vins (20 à 50 $CAD)    Le cadre est agréable. Je vous recommande d'arriver avant 19h30 pour trouver des places assisses. Possibilité de manger au comptoir.    Le service est de qualité professionnelle."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. It has a great atmosphere ( I have only been on two occasions when visiting from Toronto) and has a lovely vibe especially with the circular bar where you can see everyone. Great selection of wines and an attentive staff..... just wish there was a place like this in TO."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spot in the city. The food is delicious, the menu changes often, the cheeses and charcuteries are perfect and always well presented. The greek salad is fantastic!!! It is always packed however. Even on the monday nights. So you have to get there early..."}
{"text":"Je suis allé dans ce petit bar avec un ami après avoir lu de bonne critiques sur Yelp. La serveuse était vraiment très sympathique, l'ambiance était conviviale et  la faune diversifiée. Je me serais senti à l'aise en complet, autant qu'en t-shirt de band obscur.  La sélection de vin au verre était fort agréable (une dizaine de blanc et la même quantité de rouge).  Quand la première chose qu'on me sert est un grand verre d'eau avant même de commander quoi que ce soit, ça me donne soif d'alcool et ça m'indique que le service est porté sur le soucis du détail... J'adore!"}
{"text":"L'ambiance est tjrs très bonne!! Les accras de morues sont particulièrement bon. À visiter et revisiter"}
{"text":"5 etoiles pour mon bar prefere a Montreal ! Tout y est positif : de la terrasse a l interieur au decor sobre mais original, de la fameuse biere cream ale aux frites avec mayonnaise divine au paprika et quel service ! merci pour l accueil au sourire permanent  vite qu on y retourne !"}
{"text":"Its loud and dimly lit ambiance is perfectly fitting for the city at night.  The flavours in the food are incredible, perfect with a bottle of wine. The liver pâté is excellent, as well as the beans.  Highly recommended. I have yet to try the dessert."}
{"text":"Went recently for drinks with a friend on a Friday night. Good times, though incredibly loud. Casual, laid back, and we were impressed with how inexpensive our night ended up being. Under $25 for three glasses of wine (two were 'half' glasses, but were pretty much full) and a delicious cheese plate, plus bread. Stay away from the lower-end glasses, though (at least for the white wine). We tried six in total, and found the mid-range ones to be well worth the extra couple of bucks.   Server was a bit of a space-case, but friendly enough so no big deal. We weren't huge fans of the orange electrical cables hanging on the ceiling - made it feel like they were in the middle of renos, though I'm sure it was intended to be industrial-chic. Overall, liked the place and would go back. I imagine this wouldn't be the best place for a date (unless your date is an electrician, in which case I'm sure the decor would win you major points), but for an evening with friends it was just great."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a couple drinks before heading to another spot for dinner. Looked like a good crowd and it seemed like a happening little spot. Food and drinks were good but the service was terrible. We were visiting from Toronto for the weekend and our French is limited but the server seemed to be avoiding us at all costs and barely attempted to communicate with us. She actually came and cleared our food plates and didn't even ask if we wanted another drink (our glasses were clearly empty).  I get there may be some language differences but in any other situation I'd expect people to try to meet half way. In the service/hospitality industry I'd suggest staff should be going the extra mile to make their patrons feel welcome. Unfortunately we did not."}
{"text":"Great spot for a night out with friends. Loved the eclectic wine list and opportunity to taste by the half-glass. Food was excellent and well-priced, and our server was fantastic. All-around winner!"}
{"text":"Wow. So good on so many levels. It's a gem of a place with great selection of wine, luscious atmosphere, the staff are friendly and knowledgeable, and the menu is full of wonderful little bites to nosh on. We went for a glass of wine before our dinner reservation and ended up cancelling the dinner plans and staying here... best idea all day."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends on a Thursday for a 5 a 7.  We got there at 5:30 and it was already packed.  We were lucky we got a seat.  Nevertheless the services was pretty good and our waiter was very helpful and nice.  The bus girls cleared our plates and filled out glasses with water fairly quickly.  We ordered some cheeses and charcuteries to munch on, as well as a beet and arugula salad which was out of these world. I liked how they sprinkled nuts on everything too!  We split a quarter chicken three ways and then had some dessert and were completely full at the end.  The final bill of each of us what not too bad, and I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The lovely Simone has great food, friendly staff and good atmosphere. We were in Montreal for the weekend and based on the other reviews decided to check it out.   We arrived without reservations just after 9pm on a Saturday night to find the place noisy and busy. The crowd was literally spilling onto the patio outside, but after we were promised a 30 minute wait (which was accurate) we squeezed though the packed restaurant and waited at the bar.   The staff were very helpful in selecting wines - our server especially was enthusiastic and passionate about the wine list and we appreciated his effort recommending the right wine to go with our food. The food itself was fantastic. The bouton de culotte especially was so good i will now be disappointed with any other goat cheese for the rest of my life. The mousse and duck were also lovely. We tried the clams, actually the only item that didn't totally knock my socks off - they were very good but i found the spicy chorizo a bit overpowering for the poor delicate clam. Still, we had a great selection of olives and a very tasty rapini and pancetta \"salad\" that all went very well together.   Prices were very reasonable for the quality and experience. I'd definitely recommend and would go back on my next visit to Montral."}
{"text":"What a great spot to grab a nice drink and share some finger foods with some friends! The atmosphere is great, tables are intimate, staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the wines and tapas they serve...can't wait to go back in the summer when the terrace opens  My only complaint would be that the music is a bit too loud for my taste, but otherwise a perfect place"}
{"text":"Excellent staff and so helpful for someone like me who couldn't read the French menu! Our waiter took the time to tell us each item and offered recommendations, which were delicious!!  Great wine, food, and atmosphere"}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough. This place is a gem. The staff is super friendly, the food is delicious, and the prices can't be beat! Try the chorizo, the rillette, and a deep fried anything. We got a greek salad and I could have eaten three portions of. We also got the chicken - dark meat - it fell apart when it was touched with a fork. Yumm."}
{"text":"Hang out for good looking francophone film people. Excellent snacks and wine. Beautiful place. Packed when you'd expect it to be."}
{"text":"Personnellement, pour un endroit reconnu comme étant un bar à vin, j'ai été déçue. Une ambiance et un décor de taverne, des tables jointes qui offrent peu d'intimité (j'imagine que pour certains, c'est caractérisé comme étant convivial...?) et des plats à la bonne franquette (saucisses, poulet, etc. Rien pour nous marquer malheureusement)...   Points positifs? Un bon service.   Tout de même, c'est un endroit ou il serait parfait d'aller pour un souper entre amis ou une bouffe de fin de soirée (leurs cuisines sont ouvertes très tard)."}
{"text":"Really cool wine bar that is busy every night of the week.  Get the cheese and meat platter to share.  The chicken is really good.  The wine selection is excellent and the owner is really nice."}
{"text":"Really loved this place - for a man who likes to eat bread with his dinner, everything went with bread.  Great charcuterie (favorite was the house made duck pate), salads, and roast chicken.  I liked the big fried ball of tuna fish, too, but we probably didn't need one per person ;)"}
{"text":"Charming place to grab a glass of wine with your friends/date. I came here on a friday night with a few of my friends and although it was bustling, it wasn't an uncomfortable type of busy. We were given our own booth right away, and the waiter was extremely fast with the menu.      We decided to shared a bottle of white upon the waiter's recommendation and a plate of charcuterie. The food was actually quite good and very reasonable in price. They also have a number of other shareable tapas.       Having been a regulars at Pullman for sometime now, I've gotta admit that I'm slightly jealous of everyone that lives close to this place. If you're in the mile-end and looking for a relaxing night to catch up with friends, Chez Simone is an excellent spot.   P.s. theres no sign at the door so the place is a little hard to find. (it's got a patio out front with potted plants)"}
{"text":"We got this as a recommendation from a another restaurant we were at, otherwise I would have walked right past this place. It's very simple concept - wine bar with a paired down menu, but executed perfectly. They had excellent selections of wine by the glass, the waiters were knowledgeable and were able to recommend things based on our tastes. We got a few charcuteries and cheeses and a roast chicken which was amazing, like I said very simple but great wines and great ingredients that speak for themselves.   Laid back atmosphere, great lighting. Highly recommend and would go back."}
{"text":"Yep, still one of my favourite places to hang out in the city. Buvette just does it right. From their evolving wine list to their perfectly balanced cheese platters and sharable plates, this is my fav spot for a casual weekday hangout.   I believe all their waiters are trained sommeliers. I typically always ask for their suggestion, and it never disappoints.   The food is also on point, with lovely salads, small fish & meat dishes to share in addition to their famed cheese platters. If you're feeling really hungry, go for the chicken and vegetables, which is tender and delicious.   This place tends to get very packed on weekends, so I recommend reserving or dropping in any weeknight instead. This spot is also ideal for a date or small group event."}
{"text":"Definately a resto-bar to discover. Food is good, with lots of variety. Portion size is more tapas style, so you will get to try many things. The regular menu options are great, safe bets and the new items that rotate are usually big hits but can sometimes be misses. The atmosphere is crowded and loud so depending on your mood this might be a plus or a minus. It's not possible to make reservations and the line up can get quite long if you show up at busy hours. There is a pretty terrace if you can get a table there.The Greek salad is amazing and I'm sure you will enjoy most plates. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place when you want something a little nicer but not pretentious to spend a few hours in with good wine in hand. They have a large wine list with decently priced glasses and bottles, good food, and good service. It can get loud on a Friday or Saturday night, but that's expected at a place like this!  Overall, perfectly nice place.. Just not the best/top of my list!"}
{"text":"Good French good at decent prices. Small plates so  you can order a few. Greek salad is a excellent. Outside seating is nice. Good wine selection."}
{"text":"It feels strange to adulate over a salad,  However, the Greek salad here was spectacular; it had Greek olives (duh), Persian cucumbers, mysteriously perfect tomatoes, marinated red onion slices, and a HUGE block of fresh feta,  I had my first orange wine here; I still can't tell you where it came from (despite looking at the label), but it was herby, dry, and very delicious.  I would absolutely love to be here again with a full appetite to try the roasted chicken or the duck hearts."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for only a night, and needed tasty wine and some small bites.  Buvette Chez Simone delivered.  Great Natural wine!  Do it!"}
{"text":"I came here while in town on my \"mini-moon\".  It was our first night in town and our server was super helpful with recommendations on things to see and do.  We had an amazing charcuterie plate and wine.  The patio seating was fun as the neighborhood is pretty vibrant."}
{"text":"First time for my GF here. She loved it of course. What's there not to like. Cool music, not complicated snacks to compliment our \"beverages\"...and good company:)   What ever you do, get the porchetta. Very fresh. Such a cool night."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great selection of wine, good jazzy house vibes courtesy of the DJ.... Great decor.  Be aware though, this place is small and pretty packed on most nights. As long as you're ok in tight spaces, you'll be fine. Otherwise, maybe try another spot.  If you do check this place out, try the chicken."}
{"text":"Came here while visiting Montreal from NY. The food was good and reasonably priced, but the service was terrible. Our French leaves much to be desired, but the waiter was very rude and did everything he could to ignore us. Very uncomfortable experience overall."}
{"text":"Places like this makes me wonder on far ahead Montreal is compared to Vancouver, when it comes to the food scene. Don't get me wrong, Vancouver is up there but this place killed it for us!  We got there about 8ish,  for dinner/tapa's. Over the next next 4 hours, we went through 2 wine/cheese platters, old fashions, whiskey, a couple of bottles of wine! It was amazingly perfect. They had a live DJ, who was playing 90's R&B and hip hop!  We just sat there talked and saw the place transform from a restaurant to a bar to a club. I think the place has a lot to offer, for all age ranges and moods! Depends on when you come, you might get a different Buvette Chez Simone!   Highly recommend this place for wine/cheese and drinks!"}
{"text":"I came here for a book club, I loved the liveliness of this wine bar. This place is more of a tapas bar. The crowd was very casual- although there is a no reservation system, it took little time to get a table for 5. They had a wide wine selection- I was particularly intrigued  by the orange wine- interesting to the palette. I loved that you can assemble your own charcuterie plate- with half or full portions of meats, veggies, and cheese. The liver mousse really stood out for me. They also had main course options if you are craving something more hefty as a meal.   My single complaint was the lack quality service: Too many clients to few staff members= poor service. I don't even recall how many time we had to flag down our server to 1) get us more bread 2) get us more bread (at some point we are ready to grab it ourselves) 3) stop taking away the menus because we specified we would be ordering more food later 4) keep reminding our server of the wine i wanted 2 or 3 times..  Simple you have more customers- hire more staff to serve your customers! Would easily bump up the stars in my books if this was improved!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a friendly wine bar for my last night in Montreal. The bartender recommended a lovely white and I picked three items from their menu. Everything was very good. I will order the fries and the cheese plate with bread again. If I lived in the area, I would stop by for a quick bite to eat a couple nights a week. I sat at the bar and ended up conversing with the three people who sat next to me, which is always interesting when you go out by yourself. I loved the ambiance, the lighting, the decor, the young hipster crowd, and the staff behind the bar. It has a very authentic Parisian character that is hard to find in the New World. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"C'est cher. C'est bon. Belle clientèle de jeunnes professionnels sexy. Trop bruyant. Arrivez tot si vous voulez y entrer"}
{"text":"This was a hip and popular place we heard good things about. The food was all very good; the selection list not long and plates are meant to be shared. We had a couple of salads (Greek and Goat Cheese with Nectarine) that were refreshing and not at all heavy. A fish with a corn puree and delicious bacon was satisfying as was a small plate of smoked meat. Many tables were scarfing down chickens which looked fabulous and attested to the atmosphere here: a place to eat good simple food, drink well made table wines and laugh a lot. All of this for a very reasonable price. The hostess was very friendly and accomodating and the servers cheerful, knowledgable and efficient. A word of caution: this place is crowded and loud; It is hard to talk across the table and if you are over 40 you will be the oldest person in the place. That said the youngsters looked like they were having a gas."}
{"text":"Chez Simone is about simplicity.  From the very unpretentious but nonetheless cool design to the relaxed and casual crowd, the essence of the bar reveals itself at every level. Special mention to the low lighting, cleverly set in small fenced glass boxes and in bulbs throughout the bar, which conveys a very intimate atmosphere and an outstanding design.  La Buvette won't offer you fancy or creative drinks. Come here for the wine, either to enjoy it in inexpensive individual glasses or in a affordable bottle if you are part of three. The list is pretty diverse and likely to match all types of wallets. Aim for the 2008 Ciro if you are in the mood for a late night light yet flavorful red wine.   The food is descent on top of everything, but be aware that your choice will be limited to 3-4 available dishes late night. Go for the chorizo, olives and blue cheese. Not memorable but definitely complementary.  Chill and hip crowd. Everybody is welcome, from francophones to anglophones. Very loud, however."}
{"text":"This place is so cute. The vibe here is very relaxed and cool, the crowd is hip, the food was great, and the prices were decent. The servers were very accommodating and friendly, and were willing to explain everything to us... in English!  We had a meat and cheese platter. The pate was sooo creamy and tasty and the smoked meat was pretty good as well. I loved that it came with fruits instead of pickled veggies, which is what Toronto platters usually come with.   We also got the greek salad and the rotisserie chicken. The chicken was okay.. And the greek salad was a cool twist on the traditional salad - there's no lettuce or greens. Just chopped up veggies - tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, peppers - in a salad form with a generous serving of fresh feta.  The only downside is that there's very limited seating and it may take you a long while before you can get a seat, especially on a weekend. That's okay though, because there's usually some spots at the bar where you can squish in and grab a drink and some food while you wait."}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal and stumbled upon this cozy place. It was an energetic scene and we felt at home. We tried several glasses of different wines and each one was great. Our server was super friendly. We told him we were visiting the area and he provided us some recommendations for restaurants and bars. We also ordered the cheese platter which was incredible. The goat cheese and cheddar cheeses were amazing. The prices are extremely reasonable as well, we let the waiter select the wines for us so we were a little scared when the bill came but they were reasonably priced ($8-10 can$ per glass and $6 for a cheese plate). Anyone staying in the area has to check out this wine bar."}
{"text":"This place has cool vibes on a Thursday night but I found it ok overall... slightly overpriced and not very filling. It's one of the first times I didn't really like the wine served at a wine bar. The rosé was not very good in my opinion and for $10.50 a glass, I expect better. I can usually get a delicious bottle of rosé for under $20 at SAQ!  Buvette Chez Simone is really loud on a Thursday night (located on Avenue du Parc with lots of metre parking). Not a place to go if you're trying to have a meaningful conversation, as I had a hard time hearing the people around me.  The server was cool but not quick enough with our requests and never anticipated what we might want (wine, water and bread refills, etc). The fish fritter could have been served warmer and the vegetarian mozzarella, courgette and mushroom plate was pretty good but on the bland side. I do like that they serve some of their food on wooden planks and that it could fulfill the true meaning of wine & cheese with nice plating.   Overall, a typical hipster/plateau kinda restaurant. Don't think I'll be going back but it's good for people who like charcuterie, French tapas and dry wines."}
{"text":"Stopped by with a friend recently for a glass of wine and some snacks. This place is lovely. Their happy hour special includes a flask of house wine (about 3-4 glasses worth) for $18. Probably not the best bet for a lot of food or drinks, but for a casual glass of wine the ambience is laid back, the selection is fantastic and the service is quite decent."}
{"text":"Loved it! Went on a Friday night without a reservation and they let us hang inside while waiting for a table. While it was crowded, it was also dimly lit and had a great atmosphere. They were very busy, but our server was very attentive and was able to suggest menu items by tastes and portions! Will go back!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place you send your out of town friends to when you want to when you want to show them how impressive your city can be.    Buvette is the type of place you go to when you want to spend time in a welcoming, hip atmosphere with people who appreciate the good taste of food and wine.  It isn't the place you take your friends to who do not know how to spread out their nosh with their drink, or people who are expecting to have a traditional meal (although you can get a full chicken dinner for 2 if you so desire).  It also isn't for your friend that thinks the $10 bottle of depanneur or grocery store wine is heaven. They simply won't understand.  Buvette is great for lovers, for friends to have fantastic conversation with, or for a business lunch or dinner.  It's great in the hot Montreal summers and in the cold, depressing winters.  If you love wine, cheese, and charcuterie, this is where you go to put a smile on your face.   Sometimes it can get very crowded, but it would be a waste if a place such as this didn't."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this place for drinks after work. Although it can get loud and busy very fast, there is a very nice wine selection and the waiters are more than willing to help with your selection, in French and in English!   More than the wines, their charcuterie plates are excellent and reasonably priced. We also tried the fish and the chicken, both of which were tender and well-seasoned."}
{"text":"6 GOLDEN SHINY STARS!  this is hands down, THE BEST WINE BAR I'VE EVER BEEN TO!  I've traveled quite a bit, and had my fair share of wine with the delicious fix ins but this place is #goals !!!  We ordered 2 huge charcuterie boards between the two of us. The waitress thought we were crazy. We ate, drank, danced, sang, and laughed.. this was the best date night I've ever had in my life. My husband, Mr Single Malt Whiskey, was loving the wine & charcuterie board. What?! How did this happen!!!  I asked my waitress if I could keep a copy of our bill, in hopes that I can buy some of the items from my local meat and cheese shop to recreate the epic night we had here.  I'll forever dream about this place... until next time"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience. Wine was inexpensive, but good quality. Everything we ordered was excellent - cheese, charcuterie, chicken. I think I'll have dreams about the duck hearts for months to come."}
{"text":"Très bonne ambiance! Plats délicieux et originaux! On s'y sent bien rapidement. Serveurs sympas!"}
{"text":"I've had Buvette Chez Simone bookmarked for awhile now, partially due to the fact that wine bars are never fun when you go alone and it's so much cheaper per person when you're in a group. Unfortunately, the majority of my friends put most of their money into clubbing and buying bottle upon bottle of cheap alcohol, which is great every once in a while, but I personally don't have the energy to do that all the time and it can get a bit repetitive. So what better way is there to explore the wine bar scene than when your parents come to town and want a semi-classy affair with great food?  Upon first walking in, I noticed that the space inside was way more spacious than what the exterior implied, and it had beautiful wood furnishings that shined and sparkled with the help of the lights above. We decided to try an array of rosé and red wines by the half glass (all from France and Italy if I can remember). For the food, we got half orders of the spicy sausage, garlic sausage, duck rillettes, and bleu cheese; a Greek salad on the side; a dish of lamb with roast corn; and a half-order of roast chicken with root vegetables.  All of the wines tasted amazing and really contrasted with each other in terms of taste, even if they were in the same color group. I preferred the stronger wines as I like stronger drinks in general, but the lighter ones were still great! The charcuterie platter came with thin and crisp crouton-like bread slices, pickles and pickled onions, a cube of beet, mustard and pink sauce (not sure what it was), and bread and butter on the side. Everything on the plate tasted amazing, and when I mean everything I mean EVERYTHING. Sure, the spicy sausage could have been more spicy, but I liked how its somewhat harder texture contrasted with the more conventional one of the garlic sausage, and both had distinct tastes as well: the spicy one tasted more aged, for instance. The duck rillettes reminded me of pate's chunkier cousin with actual shreds of meat, and I honestly could have eaten an entire bowl of that and not get sick of it. The bleu cheese was savory and bold and went along well with the red wine. The beet tasted very fresh and the pickled vegetables added a bit of refreshing sourness to the party. As for the Greek salad, it was okay; I personally don't like olives that much because they are WAY too salty for my taste, and this time was no different. The other components, however, were very good, especially the feta cheese. After we were done with the starters, the waiter cleared our table so he could bring out the main dishes.  When the lamb was served, I couldn't help but notice how tiny the portion size was for the price we were paying for it. The piece of meat was probably about the size of my palm, and it cost $19.50. It tasted really good, and the knife cut through it very smoothly and had just the right amount of fat, but it still feels like a bit much for what we were getting. The chicken dish was pretty tasty and had crispy skin and juicy meat, but I've had better elsewhere at much more casual places that obviously are cheaper. The real star of the plate was the root vegetables, as they were perfectly roasted but maintained the essence of their natural flavoring.   I will definitely try to come back to Buvette Chez Simone to sample their other main courses and salads; everything here is really top notch! Now, if only I could actually afford to eat at places like here on a more regular basis..."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. The staff is super friendly, the food is delicious, and the prices can't be beat! We started with some chorizo, duck rillette, and a deep fried fish ball thing (all really really good) that came on a platter with chopped almonds and pistachios. Then we got a risotto with some roasted meat and cheesy wonderfulness. We got a greek salad - that no joke, I could have eaten three portions of. It was simple - dill, onions, bellpepper, olives and cucumbers but finished with a hunk of feta so mild it was practically sweet. We also got the roasted chicken - dark meat was a lot better than the light meat - it was falling apart when it was touched with a fork. All in all, a great experience."}
{"text":"Je suis allé boire un verre sur la terrasse de ce bar à vin l'été dernier et j'ai été agréablement surpris par la qualité du service et les prix raisonnables pratiqués par l'établissement. En effet, l'ambiance très conviviale de ce bar à vin, qui attirent en général une clientèle plus sophistiquée, pour ne pas dire snob, m'a plu d'emblée. Ensuite, bien que je ne me souvienne plus du nom du vin que j'ai choisi, j'ai à tout le moins le souvenir que c'était très bon. J'ai par la suite commandé une bière commerciale, une Carlesberg, que j'aurais pu commander dans n'importe quel bar, mais qui n'en était pas moins rafraichissante. Bref, c'est un petit bar sans prétention où il vaut la peine de s'arrêter."}
{"text":"Went there for the 1st time last week with a couple of girlfriends and it now has become one of my top spots to chill out, tapas, have a chat type of place.   Crowd is rad. Food is good. I'm obsessed with their fries and fish cakes.   I.AM.A.FAN."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a late night drink  They serve food pretty late which I find is practical after a show or something.  They have an extensive menu of all kinds of food.  They have great cheeses and cold cuts I had the pleasure of trying the Greek salad, Accra, chorizo and fries.  Everything was tasty.  Great wine list and beer Cons: it's very loud and always busy."}
{"text":"Really good tapas place. Went there for my birthday and it's great!  Very interesting menu, you must order every item on their dessert menu!"}
{"text":"Was there last night / it was hopping ! Spent my first night here after a year away from Montreal. Love this spot. Relaxed, good food, cheap drink, solid music and genuinely good fun. Glad to see it hasn't changed."}
{"text":"Super spot. Pour boire un bon verre de vin et manger des petits plats à partager c'est l'idéal. Pour moi buvette chez Simone rime avec super apero."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. Our waiter, Simone (not the owner, but he's worked there for 6 years!) explained the french menu in English to us very thoroughly, labeling each item and giving suggestions throughout. For starters, we had the foie gras mousse, brie cheese, and the fish cake, which came presented beautifully. This was perhaps the most memorable dish I had in my four-day stay in Montreal. I wish I had more, and the flavor was absolutely to die for. The wine pairing, also suggested by Simone, was perfect as well. My friend and I talked about it every meal afterward, saying how it doesn't compare to what we had at Chez Simone. Like, seriously, it was one of the best meals I've had. The greek salad was equally refreshing and good. The dessert THE DESSERT. The roasted apple was A M A Z I N G. The apple was perfectly sweet and the berry sauce (some rare berry that grows in northern Canada) was the perfect amount of sweet to finish off the meal. The only thing we weren't amazed by (but still loved) was the chicken. I think it was cuz we were so full from the starter, but it was still amazing. It's just hard to LOVE chicken. The service was attentive and detailed, and we really didn't want to leave in the end. The price, considering it's Montreal, was not bad at all. Granted, we split everything, but the same thing would have easily cost double. Amazing amazing. Is the first place I'd go to if I ever went back to Montreal. Real highlight of our trip!!!"}
{"text":"Buvette is one of the better wine bars I've tried anywhere in the past few years. To be fair, I would say it's a great small plate restaurant that serves some good wine.  The crowd is young, vibrant and dressed in black. It's loud and fun.  Three of us were thinking small for food and ended up feasting on fois gras, duck confit, charcuterie, cheese and an amazing baked red cabbage that must have been brushed with a stinky bleu cheese. We shared a small Greek salad that also had standout quality. It's heavy on cucumber, tomatoes, and a soft feta and light on lettuce.  The duck was CAD15 and everything else was about 5 or 10 depending upon small or large order.  For wine we had Bourgogne Blanc that was easy to drink for 55.  Servers were friendly, attentive constantly sweeping and wiping the table. They kept the water bottle filled as well.  We'll definitely hit this place again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the ambiance and the decor. The place looks crafted by someone hands. The table are really cool with the cold roll steal surface. I don't eat there, I just drink. Perfect spot to bring a date, the place is full of light so you'll see the person in front of you.  I enjoyed every time I went, staff is cool, i tell you, if you can enjoy yourself, you'll have a great time. And the place is kind of close to everything, night buses if you don't drink and drive ! You shouldn't !!!!!!! enjoy!"}
{"text":"Je trouve que c'est  un bel endroit! Menu varié ! Le serveur qui nous a servi était  très énergétique!  Il était aussi un sommelier ce qui fait qu'avant de boire le vin il nous faisait le vin goûter pour être sûr de notre choix ."}
{"text":"Good wine, good food. But a bit pricey for what it is.  The big appeal of it is where it's located and the crowd.   Service is average. Sometimes good, sometimes bad."}
{"text":"I like Buvette when it comes time to hang out in pretty yet casual clothes with the pretty yet casual people in the pretty yet casual decor. Delicious cheese plates, chorizo, rosette de lyon, smoked meat on plates for sharing, nice helpful staff who don't mind taking time to suggest wines even when the place is bumpin' - all of this is lovely and helps my mind adjust to having such a chic spot on this formerly sweetly super sketchy part of Parc Ave."}
{"text":"Very nice place and good food. The wine and tapas were excellent. The terrasse during the summer is pretty nice. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Start with the oysters served with a \"Bloody Caesar\" sauce. They were incredibly light & fresh. There were 2 of us & we got 4 1/2 portions of meat and 3 cheeses with a small Greek salad to split. That was plenty of food and with a liter bottle of their house white, the bill was still under a hundred dollars.   Service was fantastic. Jared took great care of us and sitting on the patio meant the music coming from inside didn't overpower the ability to have a conversation.    Great spot for dinner & drinks with a date or a group of friends."}
{"text":"Excellent! Not to be missed! The atmosphere and wine all make a great combination ... def a cool neighbourhood bar!"}
{"text":"Great place for a 5 à 7 between friends! Surtout les jeudis, il y a pasmal de monde qui proviennent d'horizons différents, mais davantage dans le milieu artistique.  La sélection de vin est excellente et j'ai essayé l'accra comme entrée. Délicieux!  Les fromages également sont de qualité et les prix abordables.   Sympatique!"}
{"text":"Very charming wine bar with excellent service and delicious food and wine.  I was visiting from out of town and don't speak much French, and the bartender was incredibly nice and gave me a bunch of recommendations on wine, cheeses, and charcuterie.  I also met a very friendly gentleman at the bar who gave me some great recommendations for things to do around Montreal.  All the wines and food I tried were excellent, and so was the experience.  Thanks for being so welcoming, Buvette!"}
{"text":"Me and some girlfriends came here for a girls dinner and it was a splendid evening! Chez Simone doesn't take reservations so we waited longer than we would have liked for a table for 4 (over an hour on a Friday night) but it was well worth in when we were sat at a bar table near the front of the restaurant.   The wait staff was excellent, personable (and cute!), the atmosphere was lively (perfect for a Friday night) and the food and drink were both equally delicious. I particularly enjoyed the roasted chicken, which our waiter informed us was the 2nd best in the city - next to Ramado's. I really liked how wine and beer came in small and large sizes - allowing me to try several different varieties.   I would go back again and again"}
{"text":"Première fois à cet endroit. Lorsque ma compagne et moi sommes arrivés pour notre 5 @ 7, l'endroit était déjà bien rempli. Malgré l'achalandage, le service était très intentionné. Le serveur connaissait bien ses vins d'importation privé et nous a suggéré les bons mets en accompagnement. Seul bémol pour un bar à vin, la sélection de vin au verre était très limitée."}
{"text":"The gnocci with mustard, dill, and pureed carrot was out of this world! Wine selections were excellent and the cheese board was delicious. A great lively atmosphere with a good looking crowd. It was busy, but tables were still available. I strongly reccomend it!"}
{"text":"The ambience is nice, but it's always super, super crowded and the food is ok."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Good wines. Having wine flights and paring options would be nice."}
{"text":"Had a wine tasting here with two friends, tried 3 reds and 3 whites, our sommelier was helpful and efficient. We got a ton of dishes, and as a vegetarian I was really happy to see plenty of tapas I could have. They really delivered, taste wise and combinations wise. Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"So good, great wine, intimate, away from the epicenter, awesome atmosphere. really cool tables (plus signs, and interesting), great friendly staff.  We literally shut the place down at 4am, and they didn't even once tell us to get out (we were having a great time with great company and just didn't want to leave), one staff actually just started chilling with us.   I've been told the food is amazing , but i got there at 1.30am."}
{"text":"Amazing resto-bar with a very cool concept! You order various items such as pâtés, cheeses, charcuteries, and warm foods from the menu and all of it comes on a wooden board accompanied with bread, jams, and pickles. And the wine selection is out of this world! Our waitress was so knowledgeable in suggesting various wines to sample before we decide in a bottle. The ambiance itself was very hip, and the DJ was great! This whole place resonates with the cool, chic and laid-back vibe of Montreal."}
{"text":"In a city that seems to be in constant flux, Buvette is shockingly consistent.  No matter what day of the week, or time of day you visit, it somehow always manages to feel like 7:30pm on a Thursday in some continental metropolis. It's never so full you can't find a seat, yet, it is never \"dead\". You will never be the best looking person there, but you will always feel better looking for being there. The staff will always appear to be having more fun than you, regardless of how much fun you are having.  Whatever you order will be just fine (unless you order the cider--and I'm really hoping it just happened to be a bad batch). The plates pair nicely with each other, so you can order without feeling the need to curate. The staff will be helpful if you have questions, and yet slightly intimidating.  If sounds like I live here, I don't--I've only been a dozen or so times, but each occasion has been entirely different.  I've come here for an afternoon snack, after work drinks, a quick bite before heading out, a quick bite after heading out, actual heading out, and I've even managed to stay until closing once.  Go with friends from out of town, friends from town, friends that moved away, friends that just arrived, friends-of-friends, or make friends there. Bring parents, coworkers, clients, a date. Same Buvette.  And yet, for whatever reason, it's not a place I'm completely fanatical about. A good choice for most occasions because it does what it does so well, but there are definitely other places.  If you're looking for a wine bar in the neighbourhood with a good kitchen that's open late, Buvette is a solid bet."}
{"text":"Fortement recommandé par mon entourage, j'en entends parler depuis un bon moment. Alors pourquoi ne pas essayer ce spot entre filles un mardi soir? Et bien d'abord, déception au niveau de l'accueil. Froid, la dame semblait nerveuse en raison de l'achalandage,nous faisait ressentir son stress. Déjà pour moi qui travaille dans le service à la clientèle ça démarre mal. On nous propose une section au bar en attendant une table, mais on ne saisit pas quand on va revenir nous voir. On veut commander à manger, mais on nous dit de ne pas trop commander sinon on ne peut bouger. Difficile de déterminer ce que veut dire une petite commande, alors on prend une consummation et une assiette de frites. Délicieuses, pleine d'épices, piquantes en bouche, vraiment à essayer. Le barman un peu froid aussi, pas très intéressé à nous recommander de vins ou autres, alors on fait notre choix nous mêmes. Ne nous propose pas d'eau, pour moi c'est un fail total dans un restaurant. Nous avons finalement la table commandons différents plats vous pouvez choisir une demie portion ou une complète. Originale et idéale pour partager. On prend les rillettes, le saumon fumé, encore des frites (yummy), le demi poulet.... La nourriture est délicieuse, l'ambiance est cool, on aime les lumières tamisées, les bougies, le cadre général. Un peu bruyant pour un rendez-vous. Mais on aime moins le service expéditif, froid et pas personnalisé Devrait travailler là dessus!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite wine bar in town. Always a great selection of wines to discover - you can go for a \"half glass\" if you want to try many, and awesome bouchées to pair with - cod fritters, cold cuts and cheese, my favorite stuff in the world. Loud but cozy, perfect for an evening with friends. Always packed, even on week nights. But yummy! And very affordable prices."}
{"text":"Had a bottle of wine,chicken and some tapas here. The place is really popping and very casual. The wait staff is friendly and helpful with the ordering. The chicken and vegetables are perfectly on point. The tapas are best quality. I am surprised that my party of 4 was full when we only ordered just a few items. Definitely gonna come back."}
{"text":"Love it. They are not trying to be something they are not, they are simply into letting people have a great evening out! merci!"}
{"text":"Small place but definitely worth trying. I've been there with friends who were new in town, and it definitely represents the great Montreal vibe. If you're lucky you'll be able to sit on the patio which adds even more character to the place.  The staff is incredibly nice and will do anything to accommodate your tastes/wishes. Drinks wise the wine is very good and very decently priced for the quality. Food wise their planches are good/tasty and have various cheeses and charcuterie, but seem really overpriced for the quantity of food you get. However all of the similar places around are about the same price so I guess it's more the area that dictates the pricing.  Overall I recommend for an afterwork. Wouldnt recommend for dinner as if you're hungry you'll end up with a salty tab. But otherwise it's DEFINITELY worth a visit."}
{"text":"Outstanding, had 4 different servers waiting on us.  Food recommendations were right on... Plus they were friendly. I'll be back next time to Montreal!"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice but I have to say that this is my favorite wine bar because of the food. I've been to a few wine bars in Montreal and I find that the food is usually average or the tapas menu is very small. Buvette Chez Simone has quite a few items to choose from such as charcuterie, fish, cheese, rotisserie etc. The first time I went to Buvette was a few years ago with some friends. I remember the wine and the chicken being really good so I was excited when my aunt suggested that we go there for a drink. We showed up at 5 pm on a Friday and sat at the bar. it wasn't too loud and there weren't many people. Although it is a wine bar, I ordered the bloody Caesar because I am obsessed with bloody Caesars and I have to try one everywhere I go. This one was good but it was in a small glass. To me what stood out most was the food. Since we had dinner plans we shared the rillettes de canard and each got an accra de morue. The rillette was very good and it came with bread, pickles and pickled onions. The size of accra was a bit smaller than a tennis ball which is pretty big in my opinion and is $3/each. What I liked best about it was the sauce that it came with, which was a curry based mayo. I definitely recommend this bar and I would definitely keep going back."}
{"text":"Magical. This place was our best night out in Montreal. It's a lovely space, the server couldn't have been more charming and helpful, and the food and wine were exquisite. They have a great selection of cheeses. We asked the server for recommendations on a combination that would include soft, hard, strong and mild cheeses. All of the cheeses were delicious, and they were presented on a lovely cheese board with apple slices, nuts, and a creamy berry spread. The bread was outstanding. The server also helped us to order a great bottle of white wine, even letting us taste a couple before choosing. The salads were also excellent, creative, and fresh.  It was a casual but classy atmosphere. The service was attentive but not rushed.  Overall, an outstanding choice. FWIW, this experience was an early dinner on a Friday."}
{"text":"Well, it sure ain't the Skala. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Buvette Chez Simone wasn't the first wine bar to open up in Mile End, but it's boldly gone where no Mile End wine bar has gone before: that mysterious two-block stretch of Park Ave. between St. Joseph and Mont-Royal, where distinguished tuxedo purveyors like Waxman rub elbows with head shops, carpet stores, appliance retailers, and other curiosities. When Cocoa Locale opened up on Park a few years ago, I predicted that it marked the beginning of a renaissance for the strip. Well, let's just say that the renaissance hasn't exactly been explosive (and the ongoing construction on Park ain't helping). Buvette Chez Simone indicates that the desire is there, though: this joint has been jumping since the day they opened. And with good reason: the food, with an emphasis on mix-'n'-match appetizers, is generally very good, but, more importantly, the wine selection is very well chosen AND very affordably priced.  In fact, I think you could safely credit Buvette with having started the New Wave of Montreal wine bars:  wine bars that are affordable, young, and positively buzzing with excitement.  Highlights: squash and rapini risotto, a good selection of charcuterie, and roast chicken in quarter, half, or full portions."}
{"text":"First night in Montreal, my friends take me to easily the the busiest restaurant in the area and I can see why. Great atmosphere, delicious original tapas. The drinks were flowing and the crowd was moving.  Plan on going back again and again."}
{"text":"Love the set up of this place! Might be one of the best wine bars I have been to. To call it a wine bar would be limiting. They offer a good selection of cocktails and beer as well.   But alcohol is easy do right if you do your home work. Where this place excels is in it's food offerings! Everything on the menu is very tasty and fresh. Well thought out menu, from the fish balls to the salads.   Looking for a great evening in a hip part of town, this is the spot. Lively crowd, a bit on the louder side of things. \"I am sorry, I did not catch that\" \"I said, I think we should order another bottle of wine!\""}
{"text":"Simply amazing wine and snack bar (if you can call calamari and chorizo \"snacks\").  This place is insane especially on Thursdays during their 5 a 7, with line-ups out the terrasse. I was here last night and by 7:30pm, the place was packed.  Great beer and wine selection where you can either buy by the bottle, glass or half-glass and with prices for half-glasses between $3.75 - $5, it gives plenty of room to try several wines without breaking the budget. Their snacks are also great. While you have the expected cheese and dried fruit plates, fries, salades, chorizo sausages, calamari, smoked salmon, options are also offered in either half portions or full portions with prices for half-portions between $5-$7. They also serve roasted chicken for dinner but only after 6pm.  That's the food and drink. Let's talk clientele and general vibe. No annoying 20-somethings or Mile End hipsters, but an older working, professional or graduate student crowd in their 30's and 40's. The people are generally very nice and unpretentious. No posers. I'm coming back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Visited last week. Service was excellent and the staff were super accommodating of my broken French. The servers spoke English fluently, which was super nice of them. I'll definitely practice my French for my next visit.   Ordered charcuterie - smoked salmon and a cheddar cheese plate, which was presented beautifully with veggies and pickles. Didn't realize the 1/4 chicken would come with roasted potatoes...should have yelped : p. The generous portion of chicken was flavorful, moist and very filling. My friend and I should have shared the plate. Lastly, I ordered a small Greek salad as my side...that I didn't need because the chicken dish is huge!!!! Go figure @ at a place known for small plates.   Thanks for the awesome experience! I think I spent $28 CAD on my meal (including a carbonated beverage)...great meal for a very reasonable price.   Oh how I miss Montreal!"}
{"text":"First time coming here with my date.. Ordered half chicken with veggies and some drinks. If you order chicken I guarantee you will love it Didn't have wine so I can't rate on that.."}
{"text":"awesome vide and chicken, the french style cold cuts are also delicious finally a place that has great food, terrace and drink all at the same time no compromising. problem is the people who gets a seat at the terrace never leaves!"}
{"text":"Mes attentes étaient pas mal hautes avant même d'y aller pour une première fois. Tous mes amis me disaient \"Marie-Pier, tu vas adoré ça. C'est tellement ton genre de place.\" J'avais un peu peur de ne pas aimé autant que ce qu'on s'attendait de moi, mais oui, c'est bel et bien mon genre de place. L'ambiance est super, à la fois relaxe et adulte. Le focus de cet endroit a vraiment l'air d'être la sélection des vins mais j'ai choisit un bon verre rafraîchissant de cidre. J'ai goûté aux vins de quelques amis et ils étaient super! La prochaine fois, c'est ça que je prends, garanti! De plus, la nourriture a l'air délicieuse. En fait, l'étoile qui manque est simplement pour que je puisse y retourner et évaluer avec justesse la bouffe que l'on y présente."}
{"text":"I love the amount of wines by the glass, the cool lighting, the small outdoor seating and the small plates, but the service here isn't top notch and I hate having to flag down a waiter several times to get more wine! The prices for the liquor aren't bad, but the food is pretty pricy considering what you get. It gets LOUD here, but for a happy hour, it's a place where you can usually seat a group without waiting for too long."}
{"text":"Great wine, great staff, great food, great prices.  Combined with great company, it makes for a great night.  On a Sunday, there was plenty of room and we were totally unrushed.  Staff explained everything, and there was a full range of wines available for ridiculously affordable prices.  Decor leaned heavy on the woods, and is very homey.  Ordering is simple - circle on paper and go.  Like a dim sum restaurant or pho restaurant almost.    We ordered some chorizo (not the type I'm used to), the pate de volaille (so good), the Greek salad (not exactly a Greek salad save for the feta, but was good no less), a quarter of a roasted chicken (stellar), some other meats (good), the cod balls (perfect!).  Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I stopped in here on our final night in Montreal and it quickly became the highlight of our dining experiences.  Friendly staff, great selection of wine (and you can even get half glasses) as well as excellent tapas style meats and cheeses.  I loved the sliced apricot that accompanied our brie and chorizo--never had that combination before but it worked!"}
{"text":"Vraiment sympa comme destination pour des 5 à 7 sur le plateau!  Avec le bar au milieu, l'ambiance est au rendez vous avec de la bonne musique, un bon verre de vin et des bonnes bouchées!  Le menu est divisé en charcuteries, poisson, antipasto, fromages et la rôtissoire ou le poulet est un must! On a le choix de choisir une portion ou demi portion afin de pouvoir goûter à plusieurs plats.  Les serveurs s'y connaissent bien dans leur sélection d'alcool et sauront bien vous conseiller. Une destination de choix à rajouter à votre liste de happy hour!"}
