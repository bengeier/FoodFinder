{"text":"Delicious smoked meats: brisket, turkey, ribs, chicken, polish sausage, and pulled pork. Don't miss the baked potatoes! Dine in, or take it to go."}
{"text":"I came here since I had a taste for some good BBQ.  I got exactly what I was looking for.  The service was extremely friendly and helpful.  The food was delicious.  It was very reasonably priced.  What else do you really need?  I had the beef brisket sandwich and sampled some of a pulled pork sandwich.  Both sandwiches were great.  I will definitely be back to this place again."}
{"text":"So delicious!  Cafeteria style BBQ. Very casual. Loved the pulled pork and sauces.  They have a nice patio."}
{"text":"Ok, I have only had their food catered for the department's annual picnic, but I would be surprised if their restaurant versions were very different.  BBQ Brisket sandwich: decent- nothing spectacular- the sauce is just ok. Mac & Cheese: Abysmal. Worse than Stouffers frozen stuff or Kraft. Mushy macaroni with a very processed tasting cheese.  Mashed Potatoes: Tasted like powdered instant mashed potatoes from my elementary school cafeteria.  For me, BBQ the meat has to be good- but the sides are just as important. Good mac&cheese, cornbread, and coleslaw are musts for a good BBQ joint. These sides tasted institutional- like they just got a delivery from the Sysco truck and heated them in the micro."}
{"text":"EDIT 12/30/16:  It has certainly improved since opening - add one star.  I'm still not a fan of the side dishes but I can easily make my own.  I just stop by for 3lbs of pulled pork for Sunday and we're all set for football.  Staff is still very friendly and now is knowledgeable as well.  Good job guys! ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Rough start, hoping it improves.  Bottom line: meats are OK, sides are not.  Growing up & living across the deep south I have long history with BBQ.  That said, the smoked meats here are simply OK, certainly not bad but far from competition grade.  The real problems are elsewhere. 1) The BBQ beans taste like an overcooked chili. 2) Potato salad has no flavor (well, just potato flavor). 3) Cole slaw is vinegar based (my favorite style) but also has no flavor - no identity. 4) BBQ Sauce has TOOO much flavor. What?? Yeah, if you like Kraft BBQ sauce you're gonna love this thick-n-tangy blanket of flavor.  It's great for covering up the taste of anything you pour it over.  I'm sure some people like this overpowering sensation.  In fact I know who you are 'cause you came to my house and put A-1 steak sauce on a $25 T-bone.  Hopefully they'll come to their senses and offer vinegar and mustard based sauces as well.  No good reason to cover up the flavor of delicious smoked meats. 5) Texas toast - I can tell it's from Texas 'cause it's big (and flavorless). I hope they round up a real pit master to fix this rodeo or it's gonna go the the way of that joint in Streetsboro that closed down after a year or so.  I don't wanna end on a negative so I'll say the building is nice, there's a great covered area in front and a patio out back with a water view.  Beer license is coming - get some craft beers please.  Everything is nice and clean, staff is courteous and I spied some pro BBQ gear in the back so the foundation is there - they just need to get their bearings.  I'll try back at the end of summer '16."}
{"text":"I frequent Hickory River and I have to say that quality and service has fallen short lately. I'm not sure if it's all the employee turnover or they just don't care about the customers anymore. One employee called my daughter stupid and messed up her order and would not make it right. Come to find out he was a manager."}
{"text":"The food at HR is always solid.  The meats are always to die for, and the sides tend to be ok.  I'll say that on some of them, a little salt wouldn't hurt anything.  However, I've never been to Hickory River where I wasn't overcharged.  One time I ordered French Fries and was charged for waffle, or seasoned, or whatever else they have.  One time I was charged for an extra side.  One time I asked for water and was charged for soda.    I've let it go once or twice but darn, do I REALLY have to point it out every time?  Anyway, the food's good, but I'd rather head to the Black Dog for a stronger smoke taste and better beer selection."}
{"text":"After reading so many yelp comments that read \"It's okay for Champaign, but noothing like what I can get back home in California\", I'm happy to say... This BBQ place is better than what I was expecting for the midwest, but is nothing like the Q I can get at home in SC! Where's my mustard sauce? (Let the great debate begin!) Anyway, I got the pulled pork sandwich with mixed sauce (they have a mild red sauce and a spicy red sauce, and mixed is... the two together), a side of cole slaw, and a side of mac'n'cheese (all three ran about $8 together). The pork was tender and had a good flavor. The sauce was very smokey and on the spicy side..not bad but could easily overwhelm the pork. I also had a bite of my friend's brisket, which wasn't nearly as good as the pork (brisket just isn't Q where I come from). The mac'n'cheese was stouffer-ish, but the slaw was great! Pretty solid. Complaint: cobbler and cornbread should be served warm. I'll be back once I check out the other BBQ places in the area!"}
{"text":"Good quality BBQ!  A little pricey for the area but definitely worth the lunch stop.   BBQ brisket was tender and juicy. Good variety of side dishes. Ranch beans were a good twist to traditional baked beans. Fries came out of a bag but I was hoping for hand cut fires to go with the BBQ. The staff was very friendly and provided quick service. Only disappointment was that there was no BBQ sauce on the tables but only bottles for sale. Extra BBQ sauce should be provided!  The sauce was good but not the best."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that this Hickory River Smokehouse opened in Aurora! We have been there several times because it is so convenient to stop by to pick up great dinners on our way home. We love the BBQ sauces that go perfectly with the smoked turkey, pulled pork, brisket, & chicken. Yummy!  Their sides are also really good, especially the cole slaw & potato salad, which taste homemade.  The staff are very friendly & helpful. Great place & welcome dining choice for us."}
{"text":"Hickory River has become our go-to BBQ joint.  Friendly staff and great smoked BBQ.  Tried the Pulled Pork, Chopped Brisket, Sliced Brisket, Smoked Chicken, and ribs.  Our favorite is the sliced brisket.  The brisket is typically sliced right in front of you as you order. It has a great balanced smokey flavor and remains juicy.  Daughter loves the caramel apple side.  Definitely a meat lovers paradise!"}
{"text":"I wish there was a way to give ZERO stars. My first (and only time there) was a horrible experience. The staff acted like serving my family and I was a burden, we weren't directed as to where to go next, the food was horrible. My lettuce was wilted and slimy, I had to take apart my salad to hunt for any good pieces on it. Only thing left was the meat. Sad, sad, sad experience."}
{"text":"Good food, good service.  Interior was a bit plain, could be  \"warmed up\" a bit.  None of the staff knew the WiFi password.  Only opened a few weeks ago, so I am sure, it will get better."}
{"text":"Great beef brisket. Fills you up! I thought the rest of the meal was pretty good.  You can mix and match here, and you get a large cornbread serving with your meal.  We also chose to get the dessert, which we barely had room with.  This is very similiar to a southern style BBQ serve yourself resteraunt.  It was tastey."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic BBQ sauces! The medium is my favorite but honestly they are all very good. I highly recommend the pulled pork"}
{"text":"If you want a fast food atmosphere restaurant with high prices and mediocre food this is the place. Order off a menu board then carry your food to your table, get your own drinks and condiments then clean up your table and put your tray away doesn't justify almost $40.00 for two meals without an adult beverage. The two  side dishes were about a 1/4 cup and of average quality. If you want Mc  Donald atmosphere and high prices, Hickory River is the place to go."}
{"text":"We were there just a few days after it opened. We were excited to see a smoke bbq restaurant open in the area. The ordering process was smooth and the employees seemed nice. Unfortunately the meat was very dry. Almost as if it was over cooked. We had the ribs, pulled pork and beef brisket. All was dry and tough. I'd give the meat 2 stars, the sides 4 stars and the service 4.5 stars. Since it had just opened we are going to go back in a month to see if the bugs are worked out."}
{"text":"We catered Hickory River for our wedding and were so pleased with the whole catering experience. They were so organized and helpful during the process.  Their staff was great at the venue.  And we cannot say enough wonderful things about the delicious food.  All of the guests really enjoyed it.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place.  I spent some time in Oklahoma, so I knew good BBQ, and when I got here, I was pleasantly surprised to discover Hickory River.  The chicken and beef are both fantastic, and don't miss out on the potato salad, the cornbread, or the cobbler.  The coleslaw isn't quite what I expected, so if you're a fan of creamy coleslaw, skip it.    Atmosphere is VERY Texas, which leads to the Sooner fan in me resisting the urge to turn all the longhorn artwork upside-down.  (Guess now if it ever happens, you'll all know who to blame!).  Reasonably priced, and the service is outstanding.  Catering is top-notch, too; we had them cater our wedding rehearsal dinner, and every aspect of it was friendly, professional, and outstanding."}
{"text":"We had read several reviews about this restaurant and some were not very favorable. Being from Texas we decided to check it out for ourselves and ---SO GLAD we did! Yes, the prices are not cheap, but the quality of food isn't either! It is very hard to run a profit margin that keeps your doors open when the mainstay of your business is MEATS.... cause they are not cheap these days. The food was authentic TEXAS flavor, tender, juicy and lots of variety to pick from. They do a big catering business also and the owner was there offering a giant welcome while making sure our experience was perfect! The order at the bar format is also traditional Texas style so we felt right at home. They also sell a SMOKED Baked Potato I will try next time along with the chicken...... we will mark them as one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"We ate here when we were in town.  It is a family buffet style where you get in line and order.  The food is good.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"If you like getting your burgers from McDonalds and your \"Mexican\" from Taco Bell then you'll love getting your BBQ from Hickory River.    This place was inedible.   Pulled pork: SALTY... Full of MSG perhaps so your brain will be tricked into thinking it was somehow worth eating.   Coleslaw: shredded cabbage with straight vinegar on it. I'm pretty sure there were no other ingredient.   Mac & Cheese: disgusting. Probably from a vat purchased at GFS.   Fried Okra: crumbly, bland mess.   We tried this place because we were tired and hungry and it had a drive-thru and no wait. Black Dog is minutes away but didn't want to bother. That was a HUGE mistake. Lesson learned. If you want GOOD food, it comes with a price. Crappy fast food? Readily available. But it also comes at a price.  I'd like to note the customer service was very polite and friendly.   ***I have no knowledge as to whether or not there is actual MSG in their product and I make no claim that there is."}
{"text":"Heeding Yelpers' advice, I went for the beef brisket, and it was really good, very soft and tender, the way I like it; I totally recommend it. The price was reasonable too, as their large beef brisket (which is 8 oz) was $9.50, coming with two sides of our choice. The ranch beans was awesomely cooked.  If I could, I'd give them 4.5 stars, but 4 is too low for them. You ask why? Well, I was expecting it be a bit more elegant. For example there is no waiter service. You enter their store, get into the line to order, get your food (very quickly) on a tray and then will go to find a place to seat. Another reason I wanted to dropped a half star is that they didn't accept my DISCOVER card (Although I'm kind of used to it, but nevertheless a nuisance). Another thing is the pricing on their small beef brisket. They ask for $8.50 for the small one, and $9.50 for the bg one, thus they're totally urging you to eat more (Not that the meal is bad, but too much meat isn't good for your health anyway).  Btw, the sandwich prices are very reasonable, with most of the sandwiches being a measly $3.99. I didn't try them, but they come in small burger buns (think MacDonald's $1 burgers size) but with meat extruding from the bun, like twice as big as the bun itself. I guess it is probably enough for a meal.     Another good item on the menu is \"meat from the pit\", which they sell by pounds. Basically if you want to bring them home, this is the best deal. If I'm not wrong, it was $9.25 for a pound of their awesome beef brisket (the same price goes for all other BBQs as well). I'll remember this deal for my next home party!  All in all, a good place to eat. I'll put it in my regular eating place list from now on."}
{"text":"Have been here innumberable times:  Consistently high quality product, service, and reasonable prices.  The place is always very clean, and  they don't mind me lounging with a magazine or the Trib long after I've finished.  Price is reasonable, and the meat quality is the best in town.  Li'l Porgy's may slightly have an edge if you like sweet sauce, but I am a fan of HR.  Great place!"}
{"text":"I have used Hickory River's catering services twice to host a party of 100 people and I was very pleased with their customer service. The staff was friendly and the order was all correct. The pulled pork was to die for! Both the spicy and mild bbq sauces received great reviews from the party. Compared to Black Dog, Hickory is better for bigger groups and the wait time is way shorter. If you are craving bbq i would definitely recommend giving Hickory River a try."}
{"text":"Terrible meat, unless you like dry meat.  I had the brisket, and the person with me had the pulled pork.  Both were dry.  A great bbq sauce can at least fix this a bit, but sadly their sauce tasted like a grocery store's generic brand.  NOW, to make the experience worse, they tried to charge my mother $33. and change, when the bill should have been $21. and change.  The lady who took our order was impatient, rude, and still overcharged my mother!  When my mom was originally told it was $33, she told her that's not right.  My mother then said the lady had hit a wrong button, so my mother started repeating the order back to get things straight, but the lady stopped her and said \"I know what your order was, I took it.  I would have walked out right there,  but my mother is too nice.  While ordering, my mom added two sides to her sandwich, and I saw for $1 more we could add a drink.  So I asked the lady to add a beverage to her sandwich combo.  We were charged full price for the drink!  One other thing I noticed was, and I have been a server for over 15 years, that there were 5 to 6 employees sitting down and eating on their break.  That's fine, but they were all sitting by themselves.  I have never seen that many employees sitting alone at one time.  That tells me that they either don't care too much for each other or they just hate their job and want to be left alone (or both).  Do yourself a favor, go anywhere but here!"}
{"text":"I used to travel in Texas a lot for work and although HR isn't as good, it's a very close second.  I've seen a few Yelps on here about how it isn't as good as Oklahoma or somewhere in the South, I think it's all in the sauce.  HR's is great for the area it is representing, if you took that brisket anywhere else in the country and put regional sauce on it you would come out on top.  I like all the sides, particularly the FRESH cole slaw, and I usually get chili and put some onions and sour cream on it.  Sweet tea is good, occasionally it is a little weak but always ok, maybe has something to do with how long it has been out.  I saw some people whining about plastic plates and cafeteria setting, or it was too country for them, where do you think you are?  Order a sandwich, take it to Starbucks or wherever you sample your brie, and quit whining."}
{"text":"Fast food BBQ. It's not going to blow your mind but it's quick and reasonably priced. It is a cafeteria style line and seat yourself."}
{"text":"Just ok bbq. Prices high for fast food.  Staff not overly friendly. Side dishes mediocre."}
{"text":"The best sliced brisket around! I have ordered the turkey, pork, and chicken sandwich but the sliced brisket is  by far my favorite. Their hot bbq sauce is perfect, but you may need to mix a little. Sides are good and everything comes out hot and fast.  Prices are fair and portions won't leave you hungry.  I wish they would open a place in Indy!"}
{"text":"My family tries to stop in here every time we are near the place for dinner. Friendly people working there and they make it up fast and quick plus you don't have to pay a damn waiter or wait for your food very long. If you don't mind grabbing your own soda or drink and cleaning up after yourselves it's a pretty good deal.  Sides are pretty good including the macaroni and cheese and the beans. Their coleslaw is the vinegar style,so I don't really care for it personally, but if that's your thing I'm sure you'll like it. Just know it's not the creamy kind of coke slaw.  I'll keep comin' back"}
{"text":"Actually, I give this place 2 1/2 stars.  The servers were really nice and helpful.  However, I felt it was too expensive for what it was.  The BBQ sauce is OK but nothing that spectacular.  The potato casserole was not that good.  It had a funky flavor I could not figure out.  The green beans on the other hand were good.  I ordered the pork loin and the pork itself was very good.  The sweet tea was VERY weak.  As my grandfather would say \"the tea walked through on stilts\".  It has no flavor what so ever.  I would not make a point of going here but if someone wanted to go I would not protest."}
{"text":"Go straight for the Beef Brisket.  Everything else is just distraction.  Totally acceptable BBQ in the heart of blandsville."}
{"text":"Pulled pork was a little dry and lacked any smoked flavor.  Not much flavor at all.  The brisket on the nachos was excellent and tasty; moist, flavorful, smoky and large portion.  Nachos were good.  Sides were okay but really small portions of about 1/4 cup.  BBQ sauce was okay.  Service was efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ served quick at a fair price. Very clean facility and they have a drive thru (although we dined in)."}
{"text":"I am so grateful for this place.  I have not had good BBQ in Ohio aside from the Rib, White and Blues fest in Akron.  And just to be clear, I an a BBQ guy from Texas so I am usually looking for brisket and not the other stuff.  This place hits the mark.  Brisket, Ribs, Pulled Pork, all cooked without sauce and served with sauce on the side.  True BBQ.  Sauce only hides the flaws.  The only down side is the 'Texas Cili.'  It isn't.  It has beans and is a bit on the sweet side.  Not the owners fault, it isa a corporate thing.  But hopefully Corp will listen to the owner at some-point ant let him do it his way.   The inside is pretty spacious.  They have a bar with onion, pickle, jalapeno and sauces.  Just an FYI, true Texas BBQ is served with Onion, Pickle and white bread, so I was very happy to see this.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It seemed like my brisket should've tasted good, but it was swimming in sauce that they pour over it. The sauce was good and spicy, but sometimes I just want to taste the meat. My sides of macaroni and cheese, cole slaw, and cornbread really left much to be desired and really brought out the cafeteria quality of this place."}
{"text":"Delicious! And what a deal. The Family Pack is 39.99 and features two pounds of meat, two sides and Texas Toast or buns. It's tucked away here in Aurora, and worth trying. They have a dining room as well as an outdoor patio overlooking a little lake,(or big pond).  It's been here a couple of years now and we love it!"}
{"text":"I've been there 2 times. Once for lunch and once for dinner. Both times really good.   For lunch I tried the pulled pork sandwich it was great. The pork comes on the bun but you add your own BBQ sauce to it. I got both hot and mild. The hot is really good. Nice heat and you can still taste the food. Regular is equally as good, just no heat. The fries were ok. You get to choose a number of sides. I'll try another next time.   For dinner I went on a Wednesday and got the brisket nachos special. The chips are their homemade tortillas. And their smoked brisket. Really good too. They are very generous with portion for the money. The specials on each day are the way to go. The only thing I did not like on the nachos were the cheese sauce on top. Now let me explain. I like cheese sauce. It was good. But it was too much. I couldn't eat it. Too rich. Next time we will do cheese sauce on the side. And add the BBQ sauce to It. Then just a bit of the cheese on the side to add my own amount. That be better for me.   The other specials seem good on the other days. I will definitely be back to try those out. Staff was nice and helpful. It has plenty of seating. Very nice addition to the area. Prices are compatible to other BBQ places. Specials are good. For a family might be best to get family meal. Downside is parking. Front in parking is limited. Businesses around don't like you parking there. It's a mess if crowded. I think you can park in the back. But not a lot of room."}
{"text":"I really love this place. Their sause is their own and it is delish. Anything you get you pretty much cant go wrong. Very pricy."}
{"text":"This was not what I expected but I left very happy. I was referred by a friend and not told this was as casual at it turned out to be. I was actually looking forward to a sit down relaxed bbq dinner.  And when you pull up, it looks like a nice restaurant. Great curb appeal.   The place was clean, smelled great, and everyone was very friendly and helpful. Great menu with all the necessary BBQ choices as well as options. They also had burnt ends, a pleasant surprise.   The decor in the dining room is \"cafeteria\" which is the downside. Really not a great atmosphere. Nice views, but scarce, empty, and not welcoming. But clean.   Food looked and tastes great!!!  Sauce choices were there and the sauce was excellent. Also great sides. This is a great addition to aurora for casual BBQ and especially take out. I will return."}
{"text":"Left something to be desired. It was more like a fast food joint environment and in the way the employees acted. The food didn't taste fresh and they put too much sauce on that tasted more like ketchup than anything else. Maybe I have a discerning BBQ taste because I lived in the south for five years, but it was definitely sub par."}
{"text":"It was just OK.  There was just something missing.  The brisket was cooked really well.  It had a good meatiness to it that you get in places like Texas, not the mushy consistency a lot of places around here have.  The cuts were a good thickness.  I wish they'd have a rub or maybe use more smoke.  Most of the places in texas have a peppery, sweet, or salty bark on them that this brisket just didn't have.  It was very roast beefy.  The pulled pork was decent, again, not a ton of flavor.  Could use a seasoning or more smoke.  It was very strange, but the dinner came with only once piece of bread.  That was not enough for all the meat we got.  Chicken wings were good, but just tasted like normal fried wings.  They could also use more smoke or some sort of seasoning.  The meat was cooked perfectly though.  They were moist and meaty.  The chili was great tasting and easily the best side, but it wasn't texas style.  Texas style doesn't have beans.  Scalloped potatoes tasted like something out of a box with a ton of onion powder.  The mac and cheese tasted like Kraft mac'n'cheese.  Very disappointing.  Most BBQ mac'n'cheese places either smoke their mac'n'cheese, use real cheese, add breading, or do something to spice it up.  The beans had no meat in it, just tasted like something out of a can.  How does a BBQ place not serve cornbread or hush puppies?    Sides to go (Macedonia) and Lagerheads (Medina) blow this place away."}
{"text":"The pulled pork! Lord Have mercky!!!! I can just eat it WITHOUT sauce! Tender, perfectly seasoned and just heavenly.  Im not all that crazy about there sauce.  I could almost run down to Lil Porgy's and get a side of there mild sauce. But again, I could just eat it naked! (the sandwich) LOL   Mac and cheese is good too!"}
{"text":"We've dined here a few times now and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Atmosphere is definitely casual.  They have a beautiful patio but doesn't appear to be set up for dining yet.  The staff is very friendly, the brisket & caramel apples are delicious!"}
{"text":"Hickory River is decorated in \"Generic Cowboy Chic\", however the food makes up for it.  Fantastic, fantastic barbecue.  Delicious pulled pork, Polish sausage, and beef.  SO GOOD.  If you aren't ashamed at your caloric intake--then you should go ahead and also have a macaroni and cheese side.  DELICIOSO.  I grinned and was emphatically delighted by such a tastylicious meal.  However, it was a bit tempered by the awkward furnishing. :)"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in town.  Comfort food in its best form: not expensive, and competitive with other local BBQ joints, even famous ones.   This place is where you come when you want to eat well.   Protein-wise, HR offer beef, pork,  chicken and turkey, coming in different  variations (chopped, pulled, sliced etc.). Everything I tasted so far was  juicy and tasty, cooked to perfection, and the flavors were always spot  on, and consistent.  HR feature one sauce with three spiciness levels - and it rocks. I usually choose the hot one (different strokes).  The sides are fresh and delicious - try the beans, chili, and slaw.  The staff is usually friendly and nice.  The dining room itself is modest and could be updated, but then again,  it's a fast BBQ place;  as such, it shouldn't be too fancy.    Whether you're a hungry student or just a BBQ lover, don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Unbelievable BBQ.  Their fixin's are really good too.  Expect some crowds for lunch."}
{"text":"We had read mixed reviews on this place, boy are we glad we decided to check it out. The meat was absolutely delicious.  The macaroni and cheese was amazing. Being from the south I'm spoiled by great sweet tea and boy the tea at this smokehouse was amazing."}
{"text":"OMG!  This place just gets better and better.  We are having to make excuses to go to Urbana from rural Tolono.  Wish they would bring one to the Savoy area.    My husband got the 3 meat, 2 sides platter.  He was sooo happy with his choices. sliced Beef Brisket,,(so tender!) sliced  Polish,, and a pile of sliced smoked ham.  The meat was pleantiful to say the least....he scarffed the whole platter down; smacking his lips after every bite.  I'm afraid I wasn't much different.  I got the smoked humongus baked potato with pulled pork and hot sauce and then proceeded to the potato topping bar for lots of butter, onions, shredded cheddar, halapeno's with a smidge of habenaro sauce on the side.  I have enough left over for lunch tomorrow and dinner tomorrow night and still share some with hubby.   This place is the best.  The employees are friendly, helpful and have great attitudes.  Probably because they're looking forward to their next break so they can partake of some of these lipsmacking great smoked delicasies!  W and S  Tolono, IL"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 2 and a half stars. Not bad, but not that good either. I was surprised that it was an order at the counter place. I had the beef brisket. It was just ok. A good brisket requires no sauce. This needed sauce as it was bland. Unfortunatly the sauce tasted like ketchup."}
{"text":"Hickory River mixed sauce is the best!!! I got a pulled pork with au gratin potatoes and cornbread. Also tried a sweet tea. My husband had the Que Shoe - cheese sauce on top of a pile of fries on top of some meat (brisket I think) on top of grilled Texas toast! Really delicious meals and we will be back :)"}
{"text":"If you're into smoked meat, you've found you're home in the CU. The brisket is as good as it gets. Most of the sides are good to. The scalloped potatoes are awesome. Maybe it'd be better in Texas, but I think they'd even say this was pretty good. I really miss it now that I'm in California. Just been disappointed by about every BBQ place out here. They definitely don't match up to Hickory River."}
{"text":"The brisket and ribs were very tender, however two dinners with only water to drink ran us $36!  No sauce on anything, it's all pre-cooked that they warm up when you order.  \"Texas toast\" is white bread ran thru a toaster, mac & cheese tastes like Stouffers and nothing was really hot.  You pick up your food on a cafeteria tray and seat yourself.  Overall, I was not impressed, doubt we will return - there are too many more economical choices in the area.  Don't think this restaurant will make it in Aurora; we were the only ones in there at 7pm!"}
{"text":"Heads up BBQ fans, this place is the real deal. Awesome BBQ! Meats are tender, not too smoky. The smoked sausage is maybe the best I've ever had. Pair it with a side of ranch beans and Texas chili, and you got yourself a slice of BBQ heaven!"}
{"text":"Dear Hickory River, I miss you so much.  I live in San Francisco now and I still look back fondly on my college years and Hickory River was a big part of it.  I went to U of I for 9 years and probably ate here 80 times, and loved it maybe 78 of them.  I've never had a more consistently good restaurant experience than this one.  My mouth is watering every time I think of the sliced beef brisket with hot sauce and hot link sausage.... soooooooooo fricken good.  off the charts... the only bbq I've ever had that was better was Sam's in Austin.    Fee free to send me some sauce and brisket and I'll send you some warm winter thoughts when it's not snowing here."}
{"text":"For chain food, it isn't bad. Nothing spectacular though. I had the pork sandwich. The meat and sauce were good but tasted like they'd been sitting out for a while. As for the sides, the beans and Mac and cheese were just okay, nothing special.  The service was very good and prompt though."}
{"text":"I wanted to update a third time. Has reached 9/10 for me. The brisket on my most recent trip was as great a brisket as I've had in northeast Ohio that didn't come from Mabel's. So so so delicious. Shout out to the crew that is constantly improving and updating. I have started to visit biweekly and get a pound of brisket every single time."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and the outdoor patio was nice enough.    The service was good too!   The parking was poor at best.  But the main point of us going was the food.   The brisket was dry and lacked the smoke flavor that I've come to expect from \"Texas\" style BBQ.    We tried several smoked meats on this visit.  The smoked turkey was moist but only so-so with the flavor.   The pulled pork was dry and just ok with the flavor.   The sides were pretty good though!   My biggest disappointment was the overall lack of flavor in the BBQ and the necessity of the sauce that frankly tasted commercial.     After visiting many BBQ joints in Texas I'd say that this isn't Texas BBQ.    It's so-so Ohio BBQ based on my experience."}
{"text":"Hickory Dickory Doc'd I wish I could argue with the Department of Health of Champaign/Urbana who posted a compliance violation to the door of this chain smoke shack, but inadequate time and temp accurately describes the over dry brisket we were served.  I also call into question their many awards they claim to have won with their barbecue sauce given the fact that the main ingredient is corn syrup. Any self respecting bbq-ologist uses brown sugar, or at worst white sugar to base their lifejuice.   Don't ask the staff which meat is in the chili that is reminiscent of mexican salsa, as it turns out, they also don't know.  I can't say I left the premise feeling 100%.  I suggest you heed the notice on the glass and get back in your car.   I'll know soon if I'm going to continue to pay for this mistake into the night and early morning as the compliance office seems to think I may."}
{"text":"This restaurant is convenient to where we live, so I'll give them some latitude. They are located in a repurposed building from the rah rah pre 2009 bust in the economy. The setting is unique and casual. If you're local, HRS is a great restaurant to add to your repertoire.   If you're visiting from out of town, this is a good option, but there are better outside of Aurora. Yelp the bbq options in this area and use your Yelp approach. I find that restaurants with more than 50 reviews and greater than a four star rating are the go to places. Another approach I've used is to look at where the reviewers are from. Hate to say it but out of town'ers from really great food cities giving great reviews means something. Locals are important too, but someone from NYC, NO, or the Bay Area have clout.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Not what I expected but cool, def casual. Order your food at the front and then sit or take out. Like the view with the water and the nice windows. Looking forward to sitting on the patio when it opens. Took a while to order but they will figure out how to speed that up with time and work out all the other kinks. Pulled pork, ham, and turkey were delicious, lean flavorful meats. Liked the BBQ sauces, served warm which was nice. Sides: apples, fries, slaw, and Mac & Cheese (I think it was Stouffers, which I'm ok with) were all great! Green beans seemed like canned and baked beans not my thing, missing cornbread at this BBQ place. Gonna come back for sure though cause the stuff that was good was gooooooood."}
{"text":"Would give it five stars for CU area, but as far as BBQ rating I give Texas BBQ in TEXAS 5 stars.   Tried the Beef Brisket and it was tender with great BBQ sauce on a toasted bun.  Greatly priced!  Even has a drive thru!    If you are a fan of BBQ you will not be disappointed. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. All of their smoked meats are awesome. My job takes me to parts of the US that are known for BBQ and this place can hang with most of them. The real draw though is the owner/pit master. He gave me a tour of his smoker and talked to me about his love of smoking good meat for 20 or so minutes. This is a place with really good food but just as important, very good customer service."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!! Every time my family goes up north to visit we eat here.  It's a must have!!!"}
{"text":"New to town and I've really been wanting to explore Chambana's food scene. I come from a fantastic food scene in Salt Lake. Oh you didn't know that? It's actually our hidden little secret. SL isn't historically known for the BBQ, but I've had my fair share of wonderful smoked, barbecued, and grilled meats.    My wife (and 10 week old) left pleasantly surprised that we found a four-star BBQ place here and mentioned we'd be returning sometime in the near future. It was a Friday night after 7, so not super busy, but it had a good crowd of families and some couples' date nights.   Ambience/fell:  You stand in line cafeteria style, with relatively small menus along the wall to be ready for your order up at the upgraded cafeteria bar. As you order, they put a few quickly served items on your red tray and a couple plastic name tents on their for anything that'll be served in a few quick minutes after you sit. The line went pretty quick (about 15 people=7 minutes), giving us a time to look over the moderate-priced, moderately sized foods (it does give a single $ under the name). There are plenty of items in the $4-$7/8 range, but some impressive-looking ribs and other cuts of meat in 'plates' (+2 sides) for about $12-$15.   My meal:  I got the pulled pork sandwich. It was good. The pork wasn't seasoned to taste, but moderately juicy and absorbed the sauce well. I thought I'd take him up on the mix of spicy and not spicy BBQ sauce - the sandwich came smothered in it (messy, but just the right amount of sauce in my opinion) on a soft bun. The portion was plenty for my moderately hungry appetite, but I was definitely over it by the last few bites.    Sides:  I added sweet potato fries (we love SP fries, and the friendly regular in front of us said he doesn't get anything else) and were looking for another appetizing side. The 'server' or worker gentleman recommended the mashed potatoes since I said my wife wanted to stay away from spice - I guess the Ranch Beans \"have a little kick.\" Needless to say, you don't go to a BBQ place for the fries and mashed potatoes. SP fries were significantly overcooked and slightly burnt and the mashed potatoes were a step above KFC's - perhaps a bit like a cracker-barrel style with a scant amount of light brown gravy.   Wife's meal:  My wife ordered the pork nachos. And we actually really, really liked the nachos. When we return, that's definitely going to be a repeat. The chips taste homemade, crispy and flavorful and are smothered in pinto beans (with juices), a plentiful helping of pork, and this really yummy queso sauce (kind of tastes like the queso dip from Chili's). Everything was really well dispersed too, which doesn't always happen at places. If we were more shameless, we would've licked the plate clean.   Sorry for the long post, but hopefully it helps."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious barbecue and food. Friendly staff. Good prices. What's not to like!"}
{"text":"I dream of ways to get back to Champaign more often for work so I can eat at Hickory River.  Yep, you stand in line, give your order, slide your plastic tray down the metal rails to stop and pay at a cafeteria-style cash register.  Then you sit down and eat all the BBQ as fast as you can, a la a prisoner c-blocking his food, because it is that damn good.  I always get the brisket.  Always.  It is lean but juicy, pulls apart when you tug on both ends, and slathered in awesome 'mixed' sauce.  I don't need a bun.  I don't need anything other than two sides of sweet corn when it is the side of the day.  When its not the side of day, I cry.  Good sweet tea.  Good desserts.  Good corn bread.  They clean up the trays.  What's not to like?  Oh, and takeout is good too."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the smoked turkey! Pulled pork is also delicious. I am not a big fan of their side dishes, but the sauce and meat, along with the casual atmosphere, make it 4 stars for me."}
{"text":"Their pulled pork is one of the best Ive tried! Brisket and potato salad were good also! Unfortunately the Cole slaw was not very flavorful. We will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"The company sent me a check for the amount of the order.  Tried again and checked the bag this time before leaving.  Perfect!!  Hickory River made it all good. :-)"}
{"text":"Real Texas BBQ has come to Geauga County! The meat was smoked to perfection. The sides were delicious. Cafeteria style dining and the causal dining room was perfect for the whole family. The owner came out and introduced himself making sure we were enjoying our meal. They have high chairs and a changing table in the bathroom. They also serve beer and margaritas. I am so excited to find this gem of a restaurant. Can't wait until it warms up to dine on the large patio."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. The ribs fell off the bone, the brisket was fantastic, the sweet corn was sweet, the cole slaw was unique (but good unique, not \"you have to get used to it\" unique), the apple sauce was chunky, and the corn bread had actual corn in it.  I was very impressed."}
{"text":"Best bar-b-que in town. Sauce is great and meat is great quality. Excellent service, clean, well-run. If you need catering in a hurry, perfect place for it."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the area. I would take their pork, brisket, and ribs over black dogs any day. Though I do enjoy black dogs, I've found the meats here to be  much more juicy and flavorful. You won't get dry bottom-of-the-barrel stuff here (at least I haven't). They are quick to walk in or use the handy drive through."}
{"text":"Feels like a chain restaurant.  A place for fat people (look at customers) to get lots of calories cheaply, washed down with pop. Champaign Urbana has real BBQ joints - Lil Porgys and Black Dog, go there instead."}
{"text":"Mmmmm beef brisket with mixed sauce.  It has the whole cheesy cowboy theme to it, but it's pretty darn good bbq. They could definitely charge more than they do for their food, and the chili is really great.  The staff was very cheerful, but man it was cold in there, so wear long sleeves!"}
{"text":"I don't eat here often as it is pretty far off my normally traveled path, but when I do I feel like it's a real treat.  I only take one star because of its location and I only eat the brisket, so I can't really vouch for anything else (though the husband likes everything else he's tried)  The mixed sauce was a little hotter than I was expecting, but I think that is just because I've got weird pregnancy hormones that make everything taste either hotter or less hot than they actually are.  That being said, their sauce rocks my socks and the brisket is so tender and yummy.  Not a \"classy\" place, with the paper towel rolls on the table and the silverware up by the register, but it's a BBQ joint.  It actually seems more appropriate that way :)"}
{"text":"This is the best place for a full barbeque meal in Champaign County.   Li'l Porgy's has the best sauce, Black Dog takes cake for the best pulled pork sandwich, but Hickory River cooks the best meal.  This is Texas barbeque.  Here, beef brisket is king.  Of all the BBQ joints in town, Hickory River has the most side dishes and the biggest portions.  The sauce is incredible, and the cafeteria design means you don't have to worry about tipping.  Perfect.   Some of the best BBQ this BBQ connoisseur has ever had."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm stunned by this place. Came here with 3 others and got the family pack meal with a pound of brisket and pound of pulled pork. A really great value considering there were 4 of us and we were hungover as hell and needed meat! It was around $40. The meat was very tender and juicy and practically no fat in it, all meat. The BBQ sauce tastes authentic and smoky, the way it should be. We ordered sides of Mac n cheese potato salad and beans. All delicious. I would definitely recommend coming here, it's more of a fast food place but considering so, worth your time, money, and appetite."}
{"text":"This place says that if you are looking for Texas barbecue, come here.  I went here and am still looking.  The food was not bad, but not Texas barbecue.  The brisket was well prepared, but really did not have a smoky, barbecue taste.  The polish sausage was OK at best.  The turkey has a bit of a smoky taste to it.  The sides are a bit lame, however.  Service is friendly - cafeteria style.  The location is clean and I wonder if they will open up their outdoor patio.  Prices are ok."}
{"text":"Sliced brisket was top notch.  Sides we're okay.  Cornbread very good.  It's an order at the front place not sit down ordering.  I would prefer to put my own sauce on."}
{"text":"LAY OFF THE VINEGAR! Corn Bread cold and dry lacking taste. The brisket was excellent, but leave the sauce on the side."}
{"text":"This is a cafeteria type set up.   You order in line... Get a tray and pay for your order.   Pick your own seats.   Which is fine... However, the amount of people standing around behind the counter, gaffing off was the first impression.  I ordered the pulled pork nachos.  I was not impressed at all!  It looked like someone put a few tortilla chips on a small oval plate, slapped a few pieces of pork and dumped chilie beans on top. There was supposed to be \"special\" cheese sauce... It had a drizzle and I had paid for extra!   What pork I tasted that wasn't smothered in beans wasn't too bad.  The employees look at you like you just spit on them... Yet laughing and joking with other employees.  Not a place I will re visit."}
{"text":"This place is sterile, and set up like a cafeteria.  The audio system is likely blaring Texas style contemporary country music.   The theme is Texas BBQ, not African-American, or North Carolina or Kansas City.  They have a system where you stand in line and tell the counter man what entree you want, plus a couple of side dishes, and he shouts it over his shoulder to the cook who plates it up for you on a tray.  Then you slide the tray to the cashier and select a drink.  You carry your own tray to a table you choose and they do the clean-up.  Brisket is a specialty.  Sauce can be ordered hot, mild or mixed.  They also do a sliced turkey.  Meats can be bare on a plate or in a sandwich.  Its very casual, TV sets constantly going, of course, because this is America."}
{"text":"Hickory River works magic with a beef brisket.  Every time I'm here, I get the same thing:  sliced beef sandwich with ranch beans and potato salad.  It's outstanding.  Their other selections are good, but not nearly as amazing as the brisket."}
{"text":"The best pulled pork I've ever had! This is one of my favorite places to eat in Champaign-Urbana!"}
{"text":"This is a average BBQ restaurant. I have tried several different items off of there menu and have found that the Cue Shoe is my favorite."}
{"text":"Best barbecue in cleveland.  I've lived in SC TX and GA and this is the best I have had here in Ohio."}
{"text":"Mmm...Pulled pork sandwich.  Mac & cheese.  Smoked turkey.  Mashed potatoes.  Bud Light.  Well, maybe the Bud Light doesn't quite get the \"mmm...\"  but you get the idea.  Their pulled pork is tasty and tender with some of the best BBQ sauce I've tasted.  My cousin's husband lived in Texas and says he didn't have BBQ down there that's anywhere near as good as this.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the people! Love the food! They have by far the best meal of any BBQ place in town. Mac and cheese is awesome! We eat there quite often and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the fact there are plenty of selections. The first time I came I felt like I was in a episode of Seinfeld with the soup Nazi because I didn't know what to pick as my sides. The wings are killer i. Quality of the food is fantastic every time I'm in Urbana I've got to go and find the best place for a barbecue and this is one of them"}
{"text":"Our first time visiting. Went in at 8:30 at night. Thought the food would taste old. We were wrong. The best pulled pork sandwich I've had on a while. The owners were very proud of their menu and their smokers. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I would describe this place as mediocre at best. Food was served to us luke warm, items were missed from our 'cue shoe order, and the staff was visibly getting annoyed at each other. Overall not a great experience."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and have to walk out it was 201 and they wouldn't honor the lunch special which is from 10 - 2 it was going to cost me $5 more for the same thing we were going to order and they refused to give me the lunch special price"}
{"text":"We picked up some BBQ for my brother's graduation party. The staff was helpful as we picked up the order. We were able to drive our car around to the side and they loaded the car up. I thought that the meat was pretty good (not as good as Black Dog though. However, very expensive for the amount that you get. Our guest really did enjoy having BBQ as an option though so it served its purpose well. I did look at their menu to see if there was anything that I would be interested in ordering in the future. My go to order for BBQ is a chicken sandwich. But Hickory River doesn't have that. They have a smoked turkey breast though. Don't know how that makes sense."}
{"text":"This place is a nice gig to get your meat fix and leave with a full belly. Though it is nothing fancy the meat is very good. We love that it is not pre-sauced so you can have your pick of options or not have any sauce at all. We love the options from pulled pork to a full rack of ribs; brisket to smoked turkey or even an entire chicken. The sides are lack luster with limited options and the dining room is very very casual and cold in winter. As I look out now everyone is wearing their coats."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed this restaurant when visiting family in Urbana.  We liked it so much we have bought gift cards for our family there on a number of occasions.  Recently there was a glitch with a card we purchased for our family.  The management was extremely friendly and helpful in sorting it out.  It was such a pleasure to have this level of honesty and service from restaurant.  We like the BBQ but we like to trade with honest people even more. We highly recommend supporting such a honest local business. Great BBQ and even better personal ethics and integrity!"}
{"text":"It's def a $$. The food is good, but fatty and be ready to pay for it when you sleep."}
{"text":"Got the smoked spud today togo. Baked potato with brisket and sweet BBQ sauce. Presentation is quite blah and the potato isn't as soft and fluffy as it could be but it was goooood!"}
{"text":"My wife an Me went there a couple of days ago.This place has changed alot since the first day it opened.The customer service was very bad and the meat was really fatty dont do alot of reviews but the service was really bad"}
{"text":"We just ate the nachos and I have to say amazing! I will order this again new favorite!"}
{"text":"M husband LOVES Hickory River ribs and we go every year for sure, on his birthday. This was our first visit to the Urbana location and it won't be our last!  The staff there was great and really made us feel welcome. Don't even get me started on the mac 'n cheese!"}
{"text":"Tried Hickory River smokehouse for lunch today. Had two excellent pulled pork sandwiches! Great sides; we tried the ranch beans, potato salad, sweet corn, and coleslaw - all were terrific. Sweet tea is the best that I have had in Ohio, reminds me of sweet tea back home in the south.  Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Oh man. If you want a taste of Texas that's not incredibly expensive, visit here. I got the two meat combo with pulled pork and beef brisket with the Texas chili and fries as the sides.  All I can say is that eating here reminded me of Austin, Texas. It was some of the best BBQ I have had in a long time, and just loved it.  I don't have a whole lot to say about it, but I will be back when I am back in town. Pretty basic procedure. Come in order at the register and cash out. Very efficient and great quality of service all around."}
{"text":"Clean environment, good food. Even non barbecue items like the nachos are made very well. Great for families or entertaining clients. A lot of small barbecue places I've been to have a warmer environment which this place lacks but I guess you can always get the food to do. Just make sure to go well before closing because they tend to get irritated & it shows."}
{"text":"Excellent bbq, I'll be sure to make my way back for the Smokey Wings! Loved the brisket and turkey as well."}
{"text":"Conveniently located right off of 74, we stopped in to get some BBQ while passing through.  Since we were on a time crunch, I was happy to see that the restaurant is cafeteria style and we were able to get our food quick, eat, and hit the road.  I had the pulled pork sandwich with hot BBQ sauce.  The pork was tender, flavorful, there was a lot of it, and I really liked the spicy BBQ sauce.  I chose mac and cheese for my side.  It was good , but nothing amazing.  They have lots of menu options, lots of different meats, sandwiches, platters, you name it.  We would definitely stop by when traveling through Champaign-Urbana again.  Oh, and they serve beer!!"}
{"text":"If you want a lot of barbecue for a reasonable price, this is an ok place, but if you want GOOD barbecue, stick with Black Dog and other options in town. We went tonight at tried the chicken, brisket, and the pulled pork and four sides and both the corn bread and toast. The meats were decent,  but all the sides and the bread were just bad. Frozen GFS corn, over salty oddly-flavored beans, flavorless mashed potatoes, and distinctly \"meh\" fries. The biggest disappointment was the mealy brick of cold corn bread.   Not that one really could expect healthy at a BBQ place, there are zero healthy options.    Food is served cafeteria style.   Long story short, if you need a speedy BBQ fix, or are a quantity more than quality person, this would probably work for you, if not, move along."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm writing this. We've been enjoying hickory river for years. Tonight was an epic fail on customer service. I called at 4:45 pm to place a carry out order. The person took my order and repeated it perfectly. My dad arrived to pick up and they  had nothing under the name given. He got out of line and called me. He waited in line again with me waiting on the phone. When it was our turn he handed phone to the person. I told her who I placed that order with she stated he was busy. I told her our order. She said oh yes I see it and repeated it. It was partially wrong so I corrected and she said ok and hung up. When the food arrived it was totally wrong. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped by Hickory River on a Friday night around 7:30 p.m. Could only find one clean table in the entire restaurant (a little two-person table).  As we parked, I noticed an employee mopping the sun room and when we got inside the restaurant noted the sun room was roped off.  Why in the world would you not rope off the sun room before cleaning it and concentrate on cleaning the main dining room first?!  It was flabbergasting - seemed to be focused on closing instead of the current customer business.  I felt like a numnut circling the dining room with my tray of food trying to find a clean table.  I love the brisket but this makes me not want to dine at Hickory River.  We've been long-time customers too - have been going since the restaurant opened up at the first location.  The previous owners did a great job of constantly having an employee circling the dining room keeping things clean.  There were also a couple of employees having a very loud conversation behind us.  Is there a manager keeping any eye on things?"}
{"text":"Wow. Never been to a place where I was blatantly ignored. One star for terrible customer service."}
{"text":"I think I found one of my favorite BBQ places. Pulled pork, pork loin, beef brisket,  baby back ribs, sausage, ham, turkey and chicken are protein options from their smoker. On this visit I had the Smokehouse Combo of ribs, brisket, green beans and fries.  The meat was prepared perfectly with a very apparent smoke ring. The brisket was fork tender and lean. The BBQ sauce is self serve and your options are mild and hot.  A nice touch that the sauce is kept warm by the dispenser. Try them both and test your tolerance to the spice. I kept going back to the hot. I enjoyed the Texas toast and sides of green beans and fries.  They make the Texas toast right front of you.  It is toasted and then rolled in butter.  The parking is a little tight. Maybe six or seven spaces in the front and ten spots in the back. We ended up parking by the salon to the left of the restaurant.  When you first walk in, you get in line to select your items.  The carver breaks out the slabs of goodness to cut and plate your selections.  You then move to the area to the left and select your item.  The location was smaller than I expected.  The dining area has maybe 10 so or tables.  Find an open table to sit at and enjoy your meal.  This is a fine casual BBQ joint worth visiting if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Food has good flavor, but I would have preferred a bigger portion of meat and hotter food. They really aren't out to impress, only to fill your belly."}
{"text":"I love the chopped beef brisket. This place catered my wedding reception for a fair price with great food."}
{"text":"Good barbecue is not in short supply in the C-U area. Hickory River is an example of a decent choice when you want BBQ served hot and quick. The restaurant is setup as a cafeteria-style outlet as I've seen in quite a few places in Oklahoma and Texas. This lets them provide fast service at high demand times.  The meats (beef, pork, turkey, sausage) are well-executed and flavorful. Brisket is pretty good and well portioned. There's even a turkey salad available which has the excellent smoked turkey piled high atop a mound of what appears to be Dole salad greens (a little off-putting). The sides are tasty but not particularly notable. Drinks are available from the fountain in the dining area. Overall, the food quality is good and is on par with the price, which is very reasonable.  Although it is a self-service venue, there are bus boys and staff that walk the dining room to check on you and will clear plates from your table when you're done. The service is friendly and fairly attentive despite the cafeteria setup. Hickory River is a favorite of mine when I'm in a hurry and don't want to spend an arm and a leg for barbecue."}
{"text":"Didn't think it was as good as other reviewers.  Thought my Ribs had a rubbery texture.  Would have given it a 1 star but the others I was with thought it was So So, so I'll give this place a 2 but that may be a stretch."}
{"text":"Smh was so ready to enjoy some food tonight. I ordered some pulled pork nachos and there is literally I fork full of meat on a container of chips. No cheese, nothing else but a small container of bbq sauce"}
{"text":"I have been eating at HR since they opened. I have tried these items: Smoked turkey, sliced and chopped brisket, pulled pork, smoked pork loin, ribs and chicken. All were excellent. The sides of cole slaw, beans, scalloped potatoes and Mac and cheese are all delicious. The corn bread is moist and tasty. Highly recommend HR!"}
{"text":"Some of the best bbq in cleveland area. This place has a main dinning room over looking the lake and in a quiet area. I got baby backs cooked to perfection with sweet sauce drizzled all over it. So good!!!"}
{"text":"Lunch for 4, Thursday before Christmas.  Brisket a little dry was only flaw.  Otherwise pulled pork, sausage, ribs, beans, mac & cheese all rocked.  It's cafeteria service, quick, self serve drinks, beer available"}
{"text":"Great option for those nights we want something \"homemade\" but don't feel like cooking. Have ordered here a dozen times and never been dissatisfied."}
{"text":"If they ever made a fast food place that served BBQ, this would be it. I kind of wish that the menu would be more clear. I didn't know that ordering chopped beef brisket meant that you got a sandwich.   Here's the real problem of the place: the woman at the cashier register taking our orders. I have Yelped over 200 places and this is by far the worst cash register employee I have ever encountered. I've seen people who were lazy and not very smart, but no one has been as condescending and impatient as the hag that is taking your order at this restaurant. If we literally took more than one second to tell her what we wanted, she would roll her eyes and talk down to us as if we were imbeciles or something. I definitely did not appreciate that.   Also, I definitely think BBQ tastes better if you truly take your time with it rather than outright rushing it (Well, I suppose this is fast food BBQ after all). I will say that the mac n cheese was quite delectable. The cornbread was also delicious, but had severe diminishing returns on flavor."}
{"text":"Food is decent, I usually get the pulled pork. The mix sauce of hot and mild is not too spicy."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork and it was very good.  I hated the bbq sauce but I am from the south and we make our bbq sauce VERY differently.  The mac and cheese was awesome.  Obviously made with real cheese.  The sweet corn was good, in fact, I don't think it even came out of a can.  The cornbread is awesome.  I've never had cornbread like that before and I wish I knew their secret."}
{"text":"Had a drive-through pick up order for a three meat combo of sliced ham burnt ends and Polish sausage with two sides of macaroni and cheese this came with a lousy little one ounce cup of the wrong barbecue sauce that I ordered I ordered mixed and got mild  which is nothing but sugar the burnt ends were so hard and dry you  Couldn't even chew them the ham was flavorful but very dry the Polish sausage was very good also ordered was a turkey sandwich also ordered with a side of mix barbecue sauce in which I got mild again nothing but sugar the turkey was very dry almost like it was day old it was The worst experience I have ever had at Hickory River next time I will be sure and check everything before I leave paying $22 for food that is barely edible is ridiculous when I can go across The street and have Mexican food that is outstanding and would have cost me seven or eight dollars less Hickory River you're falling off your game not sure if or when I will go back"}
{"text":"Ribes and sauce are good. But wasn't a big fan of the sides. The atmosphere was nice and a lot of seats available. Staff was okay.  There was hair in the food. There was a review card which says staff is supposed to check on customers; didn't happen at all. Price was not counted correctly.   They said there is a box for the opinion box, it wasn't here or not easily found. Don't think we'll come back :/"}
{"text":"I've had barbecue pretty much everywhere, especially Texas. For Aurora, Oh, it tough to find fault. The brisket was moist and tender with a great smokey/woody flavor. Their sauces are pretty good. The polish sausage needed to be smoked longer, it just tasted \"cooked\" but was still good. The turkey was very good too; good smokey flavor. The Texas Chili was good, and the vinegar Slaw was good. Since we're not in Texas, I would give the food 4.5. Didn't try all the sides or meats. Wish it had hush puppies or cornbread. My wife had the Nacho special for $5 which was a steal for be amount of food she got. If one could order a la cart like Rudy's, we'd really be on to something. Oh, and add banana pudding with nilla-wafers. You can thank me later.   The atmosphere is disappointing; very cafeteria, not very \"Texas\" or rustic. I recommend investing in wood topped tables and bench style seating. Service was perfectly fine given its not technically a sit down place (keeping in mind most BBQ restaurants aren't)."}
{"text":"While visiting the area I stopped here for a quick bite, and my experience was absolutely amazing. I ordered the brisket sandwich with Mac n cheese and green beans.   I almost took one to go lol. I think I'll stop back in tomorrow before I head back home."}
{"text":"The most amount of meat I've eaten in one sitting in a long time.  I got the shredded brisket with the ribs and hot bbq sauce.  Once your start, you really can't stop until its gone and you feel round.  My favorite place out of everywhere I ate in Champaign/Urbana"}
{"text":"We pre-ordered our Thanksgiving turkey from Hickory River. It was refrigerated and we warmed it up for our T-day meal. It was the best turkey I've ever had - smoked and juicy!! In addition, when my husband & I picked up the turkey the food looked and smelled delicious. We'll definitely be back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Yuk! This is the worst BBQ Resturant I've ever are at. I will not be returning and will advise those I know not to dine here."}
{"text":"We have driven by Hickory River Smokehouse several times in the past few years--always commenting on how we needed to stop at this place sometime. The only reason we didn't is because we didn't think they had dine in.  We were wrong!  There is an attractive homey dining room where you can take your dinner and they even have beer, wine and margueritas!  We WILL be back!!!  Best darn beef brisket, pulled pork, potato salad and cole slaw this side of the Mississippi...or Texas, which is where the owner is from!  We ordered one of each and split each dish and sampled several of their sauces. The brisket is so tasty, it holds its own without sauce, but there is a sauce to suit any palette!  The cole slaw was fresh, crispy, vinegar-based!  (Not swimming in mayo like most bbq places serve.) No tubs of potato salad from Sam's Club here --Imagine your favorite aunt's homemade redskin potato salad!  The owners put a lot of effort into making this place a success! It won't be long before we return!"}
{"text":"Found a new favorite BBQ restaurant.  We love City BBQ in Columbus and have been looking for something similar up here since moving here a year ago.  This place definately is on par.   So yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Some pretty swell Q.   Pulled pork gets a 4.5   Ribs/brisket 3-3.5   Averages out to 4  Great for Aurora, good for anywhere."}
