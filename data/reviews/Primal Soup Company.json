{"text":"We went there for yyc burger week. We showed up 5 minutes before closing, and the were out of burgers. But the woman working there was so kind that she fired up the drill and made us burgers even though I'm sure she wanted to go home. She then chatted with is for a few minutes and gave us free cake!! Then when the \"comfort burger\" came out, I instantly forgot any sad or painful memories that had ever lingered in my brain and was carried away in a euphoric hallucination (metaphorically speaking) of bacon and macaroni and feeling warm. These are great people and deserve your business."}
{"text":"I love this place! My only knock is their location and hours. There's many times I've wanted their soup (particularly their kale/potato/parm soup YUM!) and the market is not open. I wish they had a better location to server their soul all the time!!"}
{"text":"I am now asking myself why did it take me so long to try Primal Soup Company. I think it is because i usually make batches of my own soup and freeze it. But, I was tired and tempted by ther great variety of flavours they offer, so went for it with the Chicken Jambala and it is delicious!!! I am looking forward to trying other flavours! They have a great variety for different tastes and dietary needs (vegan, low sodium, gluten free etc..). They are located at The Market On Mcleod Farmers Market so the hours are limited. They serve food as well as the grocery take home soups and such. The litre soups are $11.00 each and well worth it since it is hearty and delicious. One can get several servings out of one container. I am excited about my next visit to PrImal Soup Company!"}
{"text":"Located in the Kingsland Farmers Market, the Primal Soup Company (PSC) offers a great variety of homemade soups. If I had the time, I would totally make my own broth, cut up all the veggies and make my own soup... Since I don't have time, I have become a dedicated fan of the PSC!  I first fell in love with Primal Grounds when I ate their homemade roasted turkey sandwiches. When they closed their doors and moved their family business to the farmers market, I discovered their soups. For about 10$ for a liter of soup, you get a taste of home cooking (and you can order a larger order... like a gallon if you order ahead!) The selection seems endless and is constantly changing. German borscht, Morrocan lentil, Thai coconut chicken, red curry and vegetables, green bean and parmesan and turkey \"dinner\" soup are our favorites!   As an official soup junkie, PSC more than satisfies my soup cravings while making my family meals easy and healthy."}
{"text":"I realized I've never reviewed this place!  How, after going so often, have I written nothing yet??  Well that must change - because this place is awesome!  If you want food made by someone with passion, personality and an amazing palate you want food from Primal Soup!  At this point I go every friday, and some saturday mornings right when the market opens before I head to work, because it's that good.  For example:  Meatball sub = Loads of cheese, amazing meaty tomato sauce that soaks into the toasted bun, perfect little meatballs (the downsize from the two massive ones was a smart idea), delicious every time  Spinach, artichoke and feta soup = Hands down my favourite so far and I only wish it had more artichokes but that's mainly because I'm the kind of person who eats them whole right out of the jars from costco...  It's savoury, got a little saltiness from the feta, and it's like spinache/artichoke dip as a soup. MMmmm  Chorizo/Goatcheese/Tapenade Panini = the chorizo is sliced so thin it's more like a spicy prosciutto and it's probably my absolute favourite sandwich ever second only to the way D and I customized the Beesting (I'd love to see her creative take on that one someday)!  I was tempted to have that one today actually...  Or how about her Mac & Cheese creative streak including Mac & Cheese Sliders (YUM) or flavours like cheesy alfredo, mexican, and butter chicken?  I've been going back since Taco In A Bag Special day months ago and loved almost everything I've had since!  There was one grilled cheese that had a dressing that overpowered the meat and cheese a little but it was still delicious!  The soups are all made by her and the lentil is fantastic, the roasted pepper one I sampled today was crazy good, and she bakes too!  I can't wait to see what she does with the stall across the aisle!  It's going to be hard to pick between them ...... very tough!  Honestly if you go to Crossroads Market and haven't tried this place, try it!  It's delicious!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to visit this place for a while now, but when I head to the Farmers Market; I make a beeline for Big Catch and then Roast, before heading back home. I've been bantering with whomever is in charge of their Twitter account for a few months now, and the exchanges have always been pleasant and/or hilarious.   THE MOROCCAN LENTIL SOUP. zOMG. Yelp, don't autocorrect my all-caps. The vegan, gluten-free Moroccan lentil soup is so homey and comforting that I almost ate the entire pot in one sitting (not their gigantic pots at their location; I can be ravenous, but I only have one tummy. One of their frozen, take-home containers!). I walked around uncomfortably full, with the soup sloshing in my belly for what seemed like hours, until I was rested enough to polish it off. Deliciousness that makes your MSD (Maximum Soup Density) feel like a personal challenge.   I love that all the soups are clearly marked as to what is gluten-free (I believe they all are!), vegan, vegetarian, dairy-free, etc. I love even more that there are several vegan options at any given time. You can sit down and enjoy some of their soup right at the market, or do as I did and take home a couple of frozen soups. You get a deal if you buy more than one, and if you use your app to check in, you get a free coffee. Marg encourages you to do this every time you visit, and was lovely to talk to while my purchases were being rung up. I can't wait to visit them again."}
{"text":"BEST SOUP EVER! Hands down this is the best soup I've ever had. Primal Soups is super popular here thanks to it being the best. On top of that she is entirely Gluten-Free and with vegan and dairy-free options. I can't wait for the cold weather for only one reason and that's Margaret's Soups at PSC."}
{"text":"What a great bowl of soup. I had the mushroom soup, so flavourful. It came with a thick piece of fresh bread.  Perfect for dipping. Staff and all friendly and have smiles on their faces. Can't wait to try their other offerings."}
{"text":"Really great little spot in the farmers market on MacLeod trail.   Owner is super nice and helpful.  I had Tuscan tomato soup that was filled with fresh veggies from the market, so good. They also have perfect bread to go with it."}
{"text":"One of the places I wanted to go when I went to Calgary is Primal Soup Company.   I had no idea it was in an amazing farmer's market.  I only wished I lived there.  I would do most of my shopping here.  It was amazing.  The Farmers Market is called The Market On McLeod.   Primal Soup Company is toward the back, and they have several different kinds of soup for sale to take home and cook.  However, they have a rotation of three different kinds they serve there for lunch.  I had the Broccoli Cheese soup, which was to die for!   Best I've ever had.  If I lived there, I'd definitely being eating a lot of soup from this place.  It was so, so good.  I will definitely be heading over there again next time I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"As some-what of a self proclaimed food snob, let me just say this: The soup here is fucking delicious.  I ordered the moroccan lentil soup which was a generous serving in itself, but came along with a thick slice of buttered, fluffy bread. The soup was perfectly seasoned (a carefully balanced mix of spices) and of a wonderful consistency (not too watery, yet not overly thick), and the bread was a nice addition to the meal.  On top of it all, I decided to grab a piece of banana bread as well. It was moist and not too sweet. Good overall, but the soup certainly took the stage for this meal.  I have to admit, I'm thoroughly impressed by the friendly service and the quality of the food. You can tell that an enormous amount of thought, care, and love had been put into the makings of all their products.  Of course, I grabbed 2 of their frozen, 1L soups which I can't wait to have for lunch tomorrow. Definitely give this place a try! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If you could wrapped comfort, warmth and home all up in a neat little container you would end up with any one of Primal Soup Companies soup! To put it into perspective, I actually bought a small deep freeze so I could buy more soup and never run out My only issue is that I am now in therapy for withdrawal symptoms from lack of the Cream of Kohlrabi soup.... HINT, HINT, WINK, WINK!!!!!"}
{"text":"Last Friday, I paid a visit to the Kingsland Farmer's Market to grab some lunch, so that Angelo T. and I could plan YELPFESTIVUS (YELPSTIVUS?!) times.  Friday was like the coldest ever, and my bones and I were shaking about, looking for something to warm us up. Low and behold, the Primal Soup Company was offering up some soup samples! After having to turn down about half a dozen samples since walking in the door to the farmer's market, I doubted I would even be able to have any of the soups. However, as the soup lady described the second offering, a green coconut veggie, she added, \"It's vegan!\" How did sheee know I was vegan?!?! MIIIIIIIINDFREAKS.  I gratefully accepted a sample of the soup. I proceeded to order a giant bowl of said soup with minor hassle, which was relieving, as I have a phobia of encountering the Soup Nazi everytime I go through this procedure.  Something I wish she would have had off hand, was the ingredient list for the bread they serve with the soup, as she was unable to tell me whether they might be any animal by products in the bread. Given that these guys serve up gluten free soups/stocks, I feel it might be wise to pay equal attention to the rest of the products they are serving. I simply didn't order any bread which was no problem, and enjoyed my soup! As for the soup itself, it was delicious. Despite it being a coconut soup, it was not too rich for my tastes like I find most coconut broths. In fact, the broth was pretty well clear. It was filled with all kinds of delicious vegetables, especially notable was all the cauliflower! I am current having daydreams about this soup, and hope that I will encounter it again sometimes. To Tiffany, who missed out on our lunch hangs, NEENER NEENER NEENER!   (7/30!)"}
{"text":"Located inside the farmer's market, this soup company rocks. Great soup and mac and cheese, staff is really nice and helpful. Definitely worth a stop. I had the tofu green curry soup and it was just what I was looking for, awesome flavor with a good spice to it to soothe the throat. Fabulous company!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best turkey sandwich ever. I literally get so excited when I can come eat it.  I also love love the soups.  The girls that run it and work there are amazing.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Amazing soup!!!  With ingredients I recognize and can pronounce their soup is fantastic.  My favorites are the mango butternut squash,  thai coconut chicken,  beef chilli just to name a few.  Very flavorful without it feeling artificial."}
