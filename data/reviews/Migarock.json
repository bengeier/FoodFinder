{"text":"Another little gem found  in the south by my house! While the service was a bit slow at Miga Rock, it was worth the wait. My bf and I  had the tempura shrimp to start. It was perfectly crispy. We both chose to go with hot stone bibimbap for our main.  The bowls are huge and filled with all kinds of goodness. As we were only two we decided the BBQ combos would be too much for us.  This place would be great for a group meal. They have large tables and lazy Susan in the middle for easy sharing. We were brought the standard starters Korean restaurants provide.  It included a cabbage slaw type salad, roasted potatos, bean sprouts and kimchi. Love how they provide these little bites for free.  After all that, I ended up taking half my bibimbap home. It tasted even better, warmed up for leftovers. Will return to try the BBQ soon."}
{"text":"I love Korean food, and this is one of the best places in town. Great side dishes, the perfect blend of sweet dishes and spicy dishes, and I always feel like I get all my veggies when I order bibembap. Yum! My son (4) loves eating here. Lots of tasty, simple, healthy choices and great savoury meaty and seafood dishes. The barbecue is nice. Had it a couple times. It's pricy though, but goodly amounts of meat. You cook yourself at your table  or they will do it for you."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! We have been to this restaurant many times and have found the service quite variable. Last night, however, was ridiculous. We were one of about 7 occupied tables I think, so not busy by any means. Abysmally slow error-filled service.  We ordered 3 dishes. The first main course one came quite quickly, prior to the appetizer. I said \"oh, I guess we're not getting the dumplings,\" and the waiter said \"oh yes, right away.\" We did not get them. About 20 minutes later, we asked about them again, and he said \"The kitchen forgot! 5 minutes.\" They eventually brought the dumplings. No 3rd dish yet, the glass noodles, which is why we go there. We asked one of the waiters for our 3rd dish, and our original waitress came over and asked \"do you still want it?\" OMG!  We had to ask for utensils, and then ask again for plates. We found the portion of one of the dishes to be smaller than previous (bul go gi chicken), and they have switched from their tasty purple rice to plain white rice. The food is tasty, once received, but the service was abysmal."}
{"text":"Used to be Koreanna's. My wife and I frequented Koreanna's a number of times as we enjoyed their BBQ and soups. The only issue we had with Koreanna's was sometimes their service as the waitress there was not always pleasant and sometimes she'd give us the bill right in the middle of our meal.   Now with new management, new servers, the atmosphere has changed for the better and the food is still great. All the servers are extremely courteous and welcoming. I've had the Bibimbap and the tofu soup, both were excellent. They offer a great variety of side dishes along with your meal.  I was there by myself for lunch on a weekday and had SIX side dishes all to myself (along with my Bibimbap)!  Have still yet to try the BBQ but that will be next on our list. A great Korean joint in Calgary."}
{"text":"Great food but not very good service. Basic things like water, utensils, sauces, etc., we had to ask for more than once and waited a long time before we got them."}
{"text":"Migarock experience was just okay. Heard many good things about Migarock and a lot of Korean come here to eat. I believe the reason why they come here is for the set dinner for 2 or for 4 and so on. We were not too hungry so only ordered two items off the menu. We were craving Ox Tail soup but they did not have it, so we ordered the Spicy Pork bone soup. Then we wanted something from the grill, and decided on pork belly.   The soup was nice and hot when it came out, it had 3 huge pieces pork bone (with decent amount of meat), in the soup was cabbages, greens, potato, and topped with a lot of pepper. Soup was decent but a bit bland and it is not at all spicy. The meat was soft and fall off the bone but without the soup it got very dry.   The pork belly was small. I thought it would be 3 long strips of pork belly but it looks like 1.5 strips cut into pieces. For about 26 dollars that is very expensive! bbq pork belly taste exactly as it sounds but wrap it with lettuce, rice, and sauce and you are good to go!  The side dishes were mediocre but overall meal was filling but did not meet my expectations. Maybe next till ill try the set menu."}
{"text":"I've been here on at least 3 other occasions. Not positive, but it seems the staff have changed since my last visit. I ordered the beef bulgogi and rice, the exact one pictured on a hotplate in photo's. IMO it could've used more beef and a different type of rice. (plain white rice) would've tasted better.  Am I getting picky in my mature years ?    I think not. Moon Korean restaurant has better Korean food IMO."}
{"text":"We were at Migarock 2 weeks ago during my visit to Calgary and enjoyed the food Ver much. We decided to do the cooking ourselves and we ordered the Combo C. For $170 we got a choice of apply and a bunch of meat to cook and it also included a hotpot option. The food was really good as they seem to have marinated the meat quite well. The space was nice and the flavour tasted authentic. If you don't want to do your own cooking, you can also ask to be seated at one of their booths. I do recommend this place if you feel like having Korean BBQ in the Chinook Mall area in Calgary.  Here's my Vlog on my visit to Migarock. https://youtu.be/n6Z6KyPiCcE"}
{"text":"Food is A+++!! We got the Kimchi Chigae, Pork stir fry, and Samgyeopsal (Pork Belly bbq) and I don't know what they did with them, but it's the best we've had in this city and we've been to a lot of them. The side dishes were amazing, plentiful, and varied.   My wife's favourite of the sweet potatoes (she's Dutch) weren't included at first, but when we mentioned it to the staff, they made a dish just for her! Needless to say she was overjoyed.  The food alone is worth coming here, but I think the cheeriness and hospitality of the staff is what sets this place apart. 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"Sloooooowwwww is an understatement for the service. Came here for dinner and there were maybe three other tables. Took 20 minute to order and another 30 minutes to get our food. Aside from the slow service the food was really good. With the meal you order you also get five side dishes.   We ordered the bulgogi stew with rice and the bibimbap. They both were so good and very authentic Korean food. It's a bit more pricey than other Korean restaurants. I would come again just for the food."}
{"text":"Koreanna was the former restaurant before the ownership change - it was plagued by horrendous service so it was refreshing when new owners took this place over. Our first visit about a year ago was a pleasant surprise - great quality food accompanied with tremendous energetic service.  Fast forward a year later, the restaurant now sports a few minor uplift to dining space. We brought friends to introduce them to the restaurant that I've raved about - unfortunately, we were embarrassed with the poor service levels. The food was mediocre but the poor service soured our dining experience.  Yo, just because I'm not Korean doesn't mean you have to cheap out on food and service! Had to ask twice for lettuce, had to ask for bean paste (this should normally accompany the lettuce wraps), had to continuously ask for a refresh of our Kimchi (if you give us just three stalks of kimchi, I'm gonna have to ask for more?), ran out of tea and the waitress never did refill it... I can go on and on. With the exception of the male host, all the waitresses were cold, unfriendly and unmotivated.   There's so many Korean restaurant choices in Calgary these days - having to put up with irritating service is just not worth it. I made the mistake of recommending this place to our friends, I won't make that recommendation again. I do hope the owners address the service issue."}
{"text":"My sister took me to this restaurant. It's by McLeod trail so the price is slightly higher than InsaDong in the north east.  We ordered soup I think that's good for 2 people there's 5 of us 2 of which are my elderly parents. We also ordered an entree.   Since my parents paid I could not say if it's worth the $$ however the quality of food is good.   The service is great as well. They do have those button things by the wall where your sat at so when you need their attention you just press it.  Their kimchi is really good...i love it..after having the soup they give you rice and mix it with egg and another Ingredient it's really good...since they mix the rice with the leftover broth.  The ambiance is good too...i took some pics for you guys to look at.."}
