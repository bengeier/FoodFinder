{"text":"This place made me a pizza snob. There's often a long wait for a table but it is so worth it. The pizza is delicious and the desserts are fantastic. I tried the risotto last time we went, just for a change from pizza, and it was really good. The staff seems to really love what they do and you always feel like a welcomed guest! So glad they rebuilt after last year's fire, they're a wonderful fixture in the community."}
{"text":"I read very good things on different sites about this restaurant and I was meaning to go there for a while when I finally did for lunch today and...

I LOVED IT. 

-ordered the grilled calamari for appetizer: pretty good
-meatballs on a bun: couldn't stop drooling..haha
-shrimp stirfry: the grilled veggies were perfectly cooked along with the shrimp. it only came with 3 shrimps, but it was enough for lunch..esp since we wanted dessert.

for dessert..
-creme brulee: the BEST i've ever tasted and i tasted a lot of creme bruelee's in the past
-tiramisu: omg...Delish! 

atmosphere was great.not too loud and service was perfect.

overall: couldn't ask for anymore...in fact, i can't wait to go here for dinner soon! =D"}
{"text":"When this pizzeria opened in my area a couple years ago I was overjoyed. The classy restaurant was a breath of fresh air in the Highland Creek area. 

Fratelli is owned by, you guessed it, brothers. They have delicious pizza, awesome pasta and friendly service. This place does get quite packed in the evening. The food is always fresh, and arrives pretty quickly. They also have homemade desserts, and offer takeout.

It is for sure a good place to take a date, although I have seen lots of families enjoying food there as well!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Toronto. Authentic Italian wood oven pizza.  Reasonable prizes. I want to go back and try the calzone and pasta dishes. Beautiful place with a nice parking lot. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Sorry - but the food here is only mediocre at best. And the great reviews are only because the dining out options in this neighbourhood are minimal.  I was really hoping this restaurant would re-open with a fresh new menu and new take on Italian - but sadly, they did not. Waitress for take-out was not so friendly, and the food - not even hot. It is just another pizza joint - sadly."}
{"text":"I am a Fratelli fanatic! As an italian its hard to find a place that is equal to home cooked meals  but this place takes home cooked italian food one step further!

The fried calamari, pizza and pasta dishes are to die for and each is made fresh with quality ingredients. On my last visit my table ordered the mussels which came with a phenomenal broth, the mussels were cooked to perfection and we got a huge portion to share between the 3 of us. We all ordered a pasta dish and a pizza to share in addition to the calamari and mussels and everything was delicious and hot! We couldn't finish everything so we packed up everything to go but couldn't help it and ordered one of the creme brûlées! 
This place is always busy and hustling which indicates the huge fan base it has developed in Scarborough! Sometimes there is a 30 minute wait for a table but it is always worth it!
 Although on our last visit Fratelli's was crazy busy, our server ( I wish I could remember her name) went the extra mile and put a candle on my creme brûlée and congratulated me for completing my undergrad that day.  This one small act made the biggest impact on me and really showed me that the staff here genuinely cares and works hard to make the customers experience enjoyable. This was a situation were a small congratulations would have sufficed but she went the extra step to make the evening a little more special for me, which I cannot thank her enough for. 
 
Fratelli's is a really wonderful restaurant with great food, service and staff, everyone from the servers to the hostesses to the cooks have a role in making this place an absolute favourite in Scarborough!"}
{"text":"Walked by this restaurant many times and finally decided to give it a try tonight. The staff are welcoming. The place was pretty busy for a Wednesday night. Definitely a great local eatery. 
We had the fried calamari to start and my girlfriend ordered a sangria which was not on the menu but they were nice enough to make. It started off pretty well. 
When the main dishes came I was a bit disappointed. I decided to go for the pasta special...as it was the special, I expected a little more.  I thought maybe it would at least be fresh pasta as the restaurant claimed to be authentic. It tasted like something I could make at home. 
The pizza on the other hand was great! The crust was perfectly cooked in the woodfire oven. The pizza was flavourful. No complaints! 
For two people, the bill was about $70 with tip. It was definitely worth it for the pizza. You can be sure we'll be ordering pizza here from now!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. The locals know its great - the place was almost full by 5:20! I had the Fratelli Pizza, but TA took a 1/3 of it..."}
{"text":"Cruising back from SkiDagmar and enroute to Toronto we decided we were hungry - like right now.  Not knowing the area very well I could faintly recall a restaurant in roughly the same area that I had dined at several years ago. I had forgotten that I had yelped about it!  It was early in the week, very quiet due to several holidays, so we were lucky to have an empty table waiting for us. Food was still honest, fair priced and Sal took time to come over to say hello. Funny how life can repeat itself. The wood burning oven is great for the pizzas; the seafood dish that my partner had looked amazing (and yes I tasted it and would recommend it), our side of mashed potatoes were made from fresh potatoes not some package. And due to renovations it was clean, fresh with good signage outside."}
{"text":"Food was really good. We tried the antipasto meat platter and the seafood platter and shared it amongst 4 people. Also tried two pizzas (a house special and Sicilian) and pesto pasta which were all tasty!! Customer service was good! They were very friendly and welcoming. Parking is a bit of a hassle and may have to wait for a table as they were not taking any reservations on Friday! Overall, a nice place to eat and a nice atmosphere for sure!"}
{"text":"The food is good. Excellent service.
You are more than likely going to be waiting for a table. We went on a Saturday night and it was 30mins wait for 2 or an hour for bigger groups. 
It's to be expected, it's popular and small. 
Everyone seems to think the prices are reasonable, but I think they're a bit pricey. 
It's only pizza after all.

Don't try and eat a desert pizza all on your own. It makes you feel really sick!"}
{"text":"Fratelli's is a warm and friendly environment with consistently high quality food. They serve pizza baked in a wood burning oven. They hosts are welcoming and if you've been there more than once they may even remember your name. It's a popular spotbfor puzza and pasta (often fresh). Also love their salads. Yum!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for pizza. Only issue is that they don't take reservations if your party is less than 8 people. 
Tends to be packed so you need to have patience to wait."}
{"text":"Just wow. Excellent staff, Italian atmosphere and overall comfortable environment. Calamari as a appetizer was fantastic, huge portion of goodness! Chicken Parmesan in spaghetti pomodoro entree, I must say I am thoroughly impressed with this hidden gem. Definitely check this place out if you're looking for Italian!"}
{"text":"Consistent food. Welcoming hosts. Cozy atmosphere. Chicken parm, and Fratelli dessert"}
{"text":"Just stumbled into after a date nite at the movies. Spinach salad to die for. Grilled calamarie was fresh, tender and tasty. Pizza perfectly made right down to crust. We didnt expect to finish but couldnt stop!! Great, fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Quality Italian Food in Scarborough may sound like an oxymoron, but behold Fratelli's!

I love that this place is a 10 minute drive away from me (I live in the burbs y'all!). And it doesn't hurt that the food is spot on. The last time I went, I had the Grilled Calamari with Balsamic Reduction, a Grilled Octopus special, Arugula Salad with Truffle Oil Vinaigrette, and the Mushroom Risotto.

Solid! Solid! Solid! We had to wheelbarrow ourselves out, but it was so worth it!

Love bringing my friends to this place, and surprising them with how good it is. There is such thing as great Italian in the east end."}
{"text":"Fratelli has become one of my favourite Italian restaurants. People are always pleasant here. Food never disappoints - unless you go late and they run out of their infamous cheesecake. Love dinner here - flavorful dishes and huge portions. I would drive here just to grab drinks and dessert. 

Must get: cheesecake & tiramisu."}
{"text":"Good Pizza!
They are very generous with the toppings!
The crust didn't stay crispy for too long though.
Great Calamari."}
{"text":"We come here to for the pizza. It's family owned, so there's great customer service. Consistent, fresh, delicious, and a friendly family-oriented environment. Always busy on Friday/Saturday evenings. A must-try in Scarborough."}
{"text":"The faded sign and drab outside of this place does no justice to the cozy exterior of hidden little gem. This place was packed on weekday at lunchtime, which just goes to show how good this place is. Whats more interesting is that upon entering you feel like you have left Scarborough, and are dining in some chic restaurant downtown, rather than in Scarberia, on a strip plaza. 

Our server was friendly, and showed us to a small table for the two of us at the back of the restaurant. From here we have prime view of the happenings in the kitchen, and let me tell you, these guys turn food out quick! 

We got the fried calamari on recommendation of our server and it was a good choice. The calamari was golden, crispy, tasty and not oily. I really enjoyed it. We also got the Milan Pizza, and it was tasty and the thin crust had great flavour and good char at the bottom. 

The menu was limited at lunch, but I think they have more to offer at dinner time, including pastas. Also, they have Italian beers here - Definite plus! Can't wait to return for dinner and some beers."}
{"text":"Had my wedding rehearsal dinner here 3 years ago because a lot of people recommended it.  I wasnt overly impressed.  The food was okay ( my fiance didnt enjoy his meal) restaurant was pleasant and the staff was nice.  Havent been back since though."}
{"text":"Friday evening 6 pm dinner with family, full greeting, front door by one of the Fratelli Owners, calm gentle approach, greeted and for a table of 4 a wait of 30 mins, place is cozy. Smells like smokey pizza house. 5 chairs for waiting area 2 main entrance rustic raw brick visible. Bar is as cozy as the tables close as it would be 1000 sf. We were seated, by frosted window, table bread olive oil/balsamic vinegar. We ordered shrimp parpadelle/chicken pesto penne(Fratelli) spaghetti bolanese child portion and mozzarella cheese pizza pictures included: service very prompt and owner asks how we are during mid meal. Server very aware of our table. And love food and their service. Just space is very tight, loud music and washroom very back of the restaurant you must squeeze through tables."}
{"text":"Best italian in the GTA! 

My wife and I come here as often as we can. The service is great, food is outstanding! 

If you're looking for an intimate, authentic and comforting italian experience, highly recommended! 

The only flaw is that they're closed Sunday - Monday."}
{"text":"If the opening of Fratelli on this long neglected section of O'Connor is any indication, then there should be a boom in restaurants and cafés here in the next few years. 

After visiting a friend, we wanted to try this place out and sure enough, it was packed when we went in, which is encouraging. The host and waitress helped us get settled in quickly, and the waitress was very attentive the whole night, making sure to refill our water often. 

One of our party opted for the vodka sauce penne which was reported as being rich, sweet and delicious. I had the Sicilian white pizza with sausage and hot peppers, while others had the Mediterranean pizza with olives and feta, and the Gaetano, a non spicy pizza with tomato sauce and sausage. The pizzas were all around $14 each and we also got four lamb skewers to share ($8). 

The pizzas were very filling! The crust is fired on their wood burning oven, is thicker than most, and is rich and tasteful. Out of all the pizzas I would say the Gaetano was the best, with my Sicilian being a little too spicy to taste. The lamb skewers were delicious and juicy, but could have been a little bigger. 

Fratelli is already establishing as the go to Italian place in the neighbourhood, which should help bring other much needed high quality restaurants to this area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We went here for dinner one evening. They had this special that day for mushroom ravioli.  I ordered the mushroom ravioli special with marinara sauce. My husband ordered the veal Parmesan. We ordered cucumber salad to share.
The order came in a reasonable time and we ended up having to ask for the complimentary bread as they did not bring it. 
The service was good, but the food was amazing. The portion size was good, salaad for good for us to share.
I would defiantly be going back to try other things as the mushroom ravioli was delicious!"}
{"text":"We walked into this restaurant thinking to get a take-out order of pizza on a Friday evening.  And boy, were we ever surprised!  We have lived in the area for more than 5 years and drive by this pizzeria every other day, never thinking that its an honest to goodness sit-down type of place.  Nevertheless, take-out night turned into an impromptu date night, as we wanted to check out the ambiance and the food, given that it was just down the street from the house.

Although there was a bit of a line-up, we were greeted promptly by the host, and as there were only 2 of us, were seated within a couple of minutes (although the place looked packed on a Friday evening).  The server was a bit busy, but we were noticed just in time.  Hubby ordered a beer (bottles only, no draft) and I ordered a glass of red.  We didn't bother with apps (although I would have liked to try the calamari or mussels next time) and went straight to our pizzas.  I had the Popeye's and hubs had the Original (or deluxe, can't remember what it's called).  Pizza was quite good.  Not as good as my fave in the city- Terroni, but very acceptable.  And definitely top notch, not just relative to the area (in which case it's #1), but to other pizza places around the city as well.

Atmosphere was busy that evening.  Tables were a bit close to each other, but IMHO, just close enough to give a diner the feeling of being in a popular restaurant, but not so close that its claustorphobic.  The noise level was just acceptable.  Just noisy enough to keep your own conversations private, but not so much that you cannot hear your companion.

The host/owner/manager checked up on us midway through the meal.  Which is always a plus.  The only \"negatives\" I would say would be the lack of bread service, the olive oil was nothing special (just the same brand you get from the normal store), and I was surprised to not have been offered freshly ground pepper and parmesean when my pizza came.  Perhaps I have just come to expect those at most Italian places...Nothing to lose sleep over.  But those would have brought this restaurant up a notch in my books.

Bottom line: We would definitely go back.  This is the type of place we like where we feel like we can still bring our kids and at the same time also feel like we're  treating ourselves.  The parents who read this review knows exactly what I'm talking about, otherwise, they wouldn't bother checking out Yelp :)"}
{"text":"Such amazing pizza and pasta! I've come here a couple times now and never disappoints! Also a great family feel, the owner seems to know everyone, it's quite sweet. I had the gnocchi with rose sauce. Gnocchi is my favourite pasta and I thought this dish was absolutely great. If you want something even creamier, try the shrimp papaderelle (not sure about spelling there) but its AMAZING. There's pizzas are all delicious, in the images you can see the Milan's pizza which has chicken on it. I do however prefer the pizzas they have here that have hot sausage on it instead, would recommend that over the chicken. The cheesecake was absolutely great, nice, fluffy and def satisfying. This place is great, and can satisfy any Italian craving. 10 outta 10 would recommend!!"}
{"text":"My bf and I went here for a date night. Was able to grab a table quickly, however being a small place we were placed really close to the people around us and the server had a hard time getting to us. Portions were huge. I had the risotto and it was nicely done."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening, and lo and behold my group and I had to wait for a table (tip: make a reservation or just get pizza to go!). Since we went as a group I was able to try out their pastas, clam, octopus and of course, their pizzas. Overall, I was really pleased with the quality and portion of food! Especially the pizza (duh, they're a pizzeria) which is both delicious and very well priced. The octopus appetizer is also great, tender and not chewy much to my surprise! Pasta wise, it's good, but not the type that you will crave.  Will definitely return if I'm craving good pizza, but will likely call in for pick up to skip waiting for the food."}
{"text":"I love that this is just a 20 minute walk from my house and two minute drive. Parking is usually crazy here in prime hours but there's a couple plazas in the area that you can park at. This place has never disappointed me with their quality and quantity of food. I usually get their papardelle with chicken in a cream sauce and it's like heaven in your mouth. I love trying their specials like this ravioli in a mushroom sauce they have every so often. I do a lot of takeout here, but my only complaint is that it's sometimes not packaged well and I end up having leaks in my car. They usually always have a wait so be prepared for that. Sometimes I'll just go early to put my name down. This is a must go for all the Italian lovers!"}
{"text":"Quaint family restaurant, tucked away in a residential area, perfect for a low key elegant dinner. I went with a friend who was just down on her luck who heard about this place through another friend. We were expecting a huge line up but not on this night. Service was fast, maybe a little too fast.... waitress kept trying to take my plate away when I was not even finished my meal yet. But still the food was delicious! I was savoring it...  Owner even took the liberty of coming up asking if eepverything was okay which was nice, made me feel special. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a romantic dinner for 2, or just a hide away dinner for 1 maybe? They had huge tables of 8-12 in different areas of the restaurant... I would say maybe 3 or 4 in a small 1000ft sitting area."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a wood-fired pizza oven so ordering a pizza from here is worth the experience. However, both time I've dined here I have had to wait awhile before being seated so if you are coming to dine here, either place a reservation or be prepared to wait awhile"}
{"text":"I don't usually give 5 stars but I was quite beyond satisfied at this new Italian discovery. 
* The food tastes great with plenty of sauce. 
* Environment is relaxing, welcoming and clean with a touch of Italian photography, art and music playing in the background. 
* Waiters are friendly and charming. 
To sum it all up, I had a great experience and I'd totally recommend it and will definitely return :)"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great little place! We started with 3 different salads.. Spinach, a herbed and baked goat cheese and a Caesar salad.  All made with fresh lettuces and wonderful cheeses.  Main courses were a range from linguine with clams to veal Parmesan, mushroom risotto.  Everyone loved their meals, you can always tell when everything is fresh and prepared with care.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A definite go-to whenever I'm visiting the parents in Scarbrough. The interior is a quaint little bistro, but be warned it fills up quickly and parking is limited. We often do take out. Orders are generally ready for pick up within 10 minutes.

The menu offers decently priced appetizers 
Antipasto entrées pizza pasta. I tried the stracciatella soup for the first time tonight and was impressed. Nice tasty broth. For my main I went for my regular - the Matteo pizza. Red sauce, Ham, mushrooms, artichoke and black olives. What can I say, I'm a sucker for artichoke on pizza. Their pizza is thin crust, oven charred. Both parents had the chicken parmigiana. Both said tasty, but pasta was a little too soft. This could be as a result of the transportation. I've had perfectly al dente in the past.

If you're looking for decent food in Scarborough, this is where you need to be."}
{"text":"Amazing hidden gem in the heart of Scarborough, very busy had to wait for only 15 minutes though. Not sure why people are complaining about the service, our waiter was very helpful and attentive, even brought my boyfriend a sample of some red wine that he liked. Food is absolutely delicious and arrived very quickly, the penne and risotto were super cheesy (loved it) and flavourful - if you love creme brûlée, order it. The ambiance was perfect for my boyfriend and I's anniversary."}
{"text":"Cute little family run Italian restaurant.  Located on the end of a cute strip Mallon old Kingston road, this little restaurant feels very welcoming and warm...and not just bc of the wood fire oven.  There pizzas are fantastic.  We got the Popeyes pizza very good. Crust is chewy and has those little burn parts from the wood oven.  We also got the linguine mare...honestly this  as sooooo good!  The sauce is just right and the seafood tasted sooo fresh.  Only disappointment and that's why I gave it a 4/5 was the grilled calamari appetizer...it came a little burnt (probably from the balsamic glaze...will get fried one next time. They also need an Alfredo pasta on the menu...just a suggestion! 

We will def go back!!!"}
{"text":"The people that love this place - and they are numerous - really love this place a lot. I really enjoyed the people and the service was extremely friendly and neighbourly.  But I'm afraid that, of all the neapolitan pizzas that I've tried recently, this one was the least good.  I think they are going for a different kind of wood fired pizza here, with a thicker crust than most neapolitan pizza places.  However, even when I compare it to other really good thick crust pizza places, the pizza here was less enjoyable.  

We tried a couple of different pies here, and the toppings were uniformly good but not great.  However, the crust - the most important part of the pizza - was really where this place was lacking.  It was just kinda plain tasting and the texture lacked that lightness and airiness of a classic crust.  

We'll be back to try other things in the restaurant and hope to find that it's the other items that are making this place so incredibly popular.  The fourth star in this review is simply because I've heard so many good things about this place and found them so friendly.  If it was rating it purely based on the pizzas, 3 stars would be generous."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here yesterday (a Friday) and the place was packed with people. The Four Seasons pizza was delicious, the right balance of crust and tangy tomato sauce, topped with a dream-team combination of artichokes, peas, mushrooms, roasted red peppers and mozzarella. I don't anticipate any further visits to Scarborough, though, which is a shame because I'd be back at Fratelli's for this pizza in a heartbeat. I wasn't a fan of the house white wine (Velletri); pay a little more and order something else."}
{"text":"Heard great reviews about Fratelli so we kinda expected a bit more but it was just okay. Relatively small restaurant and with no reservations allowed, we waited about 45 mins. for our table. Cozy atmosphere inside with the dim dinner lighting and the warmth of the pizza wood-burning oven. Had to return my glass of water as there was a full lipstick stain on the rim...gross! Ordered the grilled seafood platter and while presentable, portion was a bit lacking...almost $20 for about two dozen really teeny tiny mussels, four jumbo shrimps and three calamari ringlets. Another in my party were a bit unsatisfied with the spaghetti bolognese as well...too much sauce, not enough meat. For the wait and bill, seemed a bit overrated and overpriced. Would not dine here again."}
{"text":"So I found out about this hidden gem from my friends at work. One friend told me about this restaurant last week and this other one told me she is heading over tonight. This really sparked my interest as both of them enjoyed the food here. 

Appetizer 
Grilled Calamari-grilled with a balsamic reduction
($12.95)
The way they cooked the Calamari was unique. It's interesting but I think more flavour can be added. Usually I don't squeeze the lemon, but for this dish, I had to use the lemon to add flavours.

Fratelli Pizza
Tomato sauce, pepperoni, bacon, hot sausage, cooked ham and mozzarella ($16.50)
The pizza was not bad, but I think the base can use more texture as I find the base too soft and moist. But the toppings went well together and tasted good.

Drumroll, I love Pappardelle. Many Italian restaurant doesn't have so many pappardelle options. This restaurant serves a few different options with different meat. The cream sauce was amazing!! It was rich, yet not salty and have the right consistency with a nice garlics flavour. The shrimp is a good size and doesn't have that frozen taste to it. My favourite dish so far. The Riesling went well with the Pappardelle!

Shrimp Pappardelle
Shrimp with diced tomatoes in cream sauce ($19.95)
Clean Slate-Riesling (Germany) $8.25 (6oz)

Will recommend this restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. 100% of the time every. time. I . visit.
Always a wait. 
Always worth it.
The atmosphere is so welcoming and enjoyable. The big pizza oven is visible to the patrons and the owners are friendly.
The food is phenomenal. It has what I consider the best pizza in Ontario. Forget Libretto or Torreni. 
The prices are crazy reasonable. Every person I know has a different favorite and that's just because everything is so delicious."}
{"text":"I had previously cone here to order their pizza for the wife and I.  

This trip was to celebrate a job promotion.  We arrived at 6:30 pm on a Friday.  I ordered the special of the day pizza and the wife ordered a shrimp and pasta special.  The hostess, Jackie, made us feel welcome as she took us to our table.  The place is small but cozy not cramped.  I also didn't feel like I could over hear the conversation be side me. 

We started with Bruschetta.  It arrived quickly and took the edge of my hunger.  The meals arrive fast and hot.  The pasta portions are generous and we took the left overs home. 

I enjoyed a stone oven cooked pizza that is thin crust.  Very good and shared some with the wife. 

We saved room for dessert.  The choice for me was between tiramisu and creme brûlée. The tiramisu was very light was a great cap to the meal.  My wife loves creme brûlée and while I was generous to share mine dessert hers was disappeared before I could get a sample.  But I take my wife's word it was delicious. 

The check out took a bit longer than I would have liked.  But that said it was a great way to celebrate and enjoy a great meal."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week and we loved it! Parking is a little tricky. 
Group of 4, no wait which was great. We ordered the fried calamari & bruschetta as appetizers. I wouldn't order the bruschetta again. It was okay but I'd rather try something else. The calamari was excellent. I'd order that again. 
3 of us had the chicken pesto penne. It was amazing. One had the pizza. It looked so good. 
5 beers, 2 apps, 4 entrees $130 with tax. 
Service was excellent. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Everyone needs to have their own version of Fratelli's in their neighborhood.  This cheap and cheery Italian restaurant is a local gem in Highland Creek.  Everyone, and I mean practically everyone in the neighborhood has patronized this place.  The pizza is terrific and so is the service.  You can't go wrong.  Too bad I am not a stone throw's away anymore."}
{"text":"\"The pizza's crust itself was thin and floury. We found White Pizza quite an interesting and remarkably flavorful choice. It came with copious areas of ricotta cheese, smoked salmon, the dish was adorned with plenty of spinach, red onion and some delicious fried capers (the most original ingredient for us).\"
\"Fratelli is quite a place for the neighborhood. Definitely a restaurant to visit with your family in the evening, or even on a date. We found it not pretentious, but wholesome. The service was great and staff very knowledgeable. \"

Just a few bites of our experience.."}
{"text":"This is one of my most favorite authentic Sicilian restaurants. Every dish I've ordered is homemade and very tasteful. Love it so much we celebrate many occasions there. The restaurant is always busy and the wait can be long but definitely worth it. They have stone baked pizza which is to die for and pasta that will leave you talking about for days. The owners are the nicest family and make sure your experience is a good one. Grazie!!"}
{"text":"While I understand the difficulties they have because they are small and get busy I do not appreciate the obvious difference in service that friends and regulars receive. Waiter has more time for them and was definitely friendlier.  Have been twice just to make sure I wasn't being paranoid.  I think because of lack of good restaurants in the area they can get away with this attitude. If I was just judging food I would give them 3 stars. It is average."}
{"text":"Wow what can I say

Firstly I miss living back in Highland Creek

Used to frequent this place alot

Secondly the food is great 

Me and my wife usually share a salad along with a pizza and pasta and if we're not ordering alcohol, we get a bill of about 40 for everything which is awesome

Staff is great

Doesn't hurt when your a family member of your wife works there too

Owner/manager always greets you and the staff is super friendly

Will always go back again!!!"}
{"text":"It is with a heavy heart that I have to leave this Review. Truth be told this was one of our favourite restaurants with great Service. We even Supported the opening of their second location on O'conner before they shut it down. I had always raved to my mother about this place. Tonight she wanted Italian so I told her I'm going to take her to my favourite place and assured her she was going to love it. My mother is a lady of leisure and luxury whom is accustomed to frequent fine dinning. I told her she'll add this family owned spot to her list. The restaurant closes daily at 10pm with the exception of Sundays, where they close at 9 and Mondays where they are closed. We arrived at 8:45 PM tonight, December 13, 2017. We were greeted by one of the waiters promptly, as usual, where I requested a table for 3. I informed him our other party will be arriving shortly. He stopped me and asked, \"When? Because we're closing soon!\" With a puzzled look I glanced at my phone and noticed it was only 8:45. I proceeded to tell the waiter, your hours say you're open till 10 and it's only 8:45. He then informed \"Yeah when we're not busy, we close early\". Well guess what? A party of 3 just walked in. You're now busy! I looked around to see if that was posted anywhere and it wasn't. The waiter asked a second time, \"how long will your party be?\". Feeling annoyed, I pulled out my phone and called my friend whom advised she was 5 minutes away. I told the waiter she's 5 minutes away. Are we welcome or should we leave. Keep in mind, there were still plenty of people in the restaurant. His response? \"Well I'm not kicking you out, but I mean if she's gonna be half an hour\".. he the chuckled and left the end of his sentence open to interpretation. At this point I was left  bewildered and could not believe I was having this conversation. Especially here, at Fratelli. We told him well she's 5 minutes away so I guess if it's ok, we'll have a seat. We were taken to our seats where the serving waiter whom was serving the table beside us, seemingly annoyed, glanced over with no acknowledgement. We were starting to feel very uncomfortable. I was starting to feel so embarrassed in front of my mother. Mind you, being the lady that she is, she didn't utter a word. We ordered our drinks and appetizer at which time my friend arrived. Traditionally, as soon as u sit down, you are served with bread, butter and a plate of olive oil drizzled with Balsamic. Once my friend joined us, I had to ask the waiter... \"is your bread finished?\" Waiter : \"I don't know, I'll check\". Clearly he had no intention of serving us bread. Minutes later he came back with bread and placed it on the table... \"So, do you know what you're having?\" Having barely looked over the menu we ordered. Fortunately, sine we frequent this place we knew the menu and could order quickly. My mother asked the waiter which pizza he recommends.. Waiter \"Read the toppings and see what you like\"... she was left baffled and just stared at him. He then pointed to the Victoria or Fratelli. Oddly enough she took his recommendation and ordered the Fratelli. I had to ask for a straw 3 times. The food arrived in a timely manner and was delicious as always. It was about 9:30, we still had plenty of food left on our plates, the waiter approached asking if we were done with our meals. At this point i was so fed up that I just told him to pack it up. Within five minutes he returns with our packed food and the bill. We jokingly asked for dessert only to find out the kitchen had closed at 9:30 on the dot and the chef had already gone home. Really? Any proper waiter who knows customer service would inform his guests that if they are interested in desert to order as the kitchen is closing. That never happened. Ultimately their goal was to kick us out as soon as possible. And that's exactly what happened. We were basically rushed and kicked out and felt like we were not welcome. Maybe this happened because Jackie or one of the brothers who owns the joint were not there. I don't know. But it was the worst experience we've ever had and definitely unexpected. I'm left quite perplexed about returning to Fratelli Village Pizzeria! But if We're gonna drop $100 bucks... shouldn't we at least get good service and feel comfortable? Here's the kicker, my mother ended up tipping the waiter When asked why? She replied, \"Don't ever lower yourself to someone's level or compromise your class\" . Huh!"}
{"text":"A cozy restaurant with great Italian food. Worth the stop, if you are in the area. It appears quite popular with the locals.  A good variety of premium homemade pizzas and side dishes. A good find at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"When we first walked in, the person to greet us didn't so much as say hello, he just grabbed menus and walked away..we followed him to the table he started clearing, but he then walked away to a different table and simply said \"here\". The waitress didn't approach us for quite some time, but in some defence she seemed to be the only one working (another waitress was present, but chatted with patrons for the majority of our stay). The pizza on special was a poor choice to advertise as it lacked flavour. $30 for a personal size pizza and a regular tea."}
{"text":"Traditional thin crust pizza and pastas etc... Wood burning oven whereupon the chef wears a heat shield that covers his face as the oven is tremendously hot.  Pizza is ordered and within 10 minutes is on the table.
Brilliant taste.  Staff is everywhere and very helpful and friendly.  One of the owners came to the table and asked how everything was and at the end shook my hand stating to have a great night.  
Overall, one of the best dining experiences I have had and one of the best pizzas ever."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant.  Friendly service.  Good homemade food. Very busy so go early in the week or early supper time."}
{"text":"Delicious food that arrived very quickly and the service was great. Location is a bit hard to spot and a bit small inside other than that the food and service is impeccable"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Long wait (doesn't take reservations) food presentation could be better but overall superb. 
- definitely order the daily specials (they're specials for a reason) 
- the grilled octopus is awesomely tender 
- grilled calamari drizzled in truffle oil is delish
- mushroom risotto is huge serving so share it don't eat it as an entree unless you want to take it home
- atmosphere is very busy but quaint"}
{"text":"Fratelli's village pizzeria is probably one of the best kept secrets in Scarborough.  I actually have a friend that lived in the neighbourhood her entire life, went to church across the street and had no idea this place existed! 

That being said, secret or no secret, this place is always busy with locals.  On any given night, you can expect the restaurant to be full and there will probably be a wait.  We actually didn't sucessfully eat at the restaurant until our third try!

Fratelli is known for their pizza.  They have a wood burning oven in the restaurant and a large selection of thin crust pizzas as well as pastas, risottos and mains.  Their calamari is also the best in the city and by that, I mean Toronto, not just Scarborough.

If you have room after dinner, be sure to order a Tiramisu.  It is not to be missed!  I am not a huge Tiramisu fan but after a bite, I was instantly a convert.  

There aren't many restaurants in Scarborough that I'd consider nice enough for a special occasion.  While this is not a \"fancy\" place, it is definitely nice enough for a date and not stuffy enough that you can't bring your entire family including the kids."}
{"text":"Was told to wait two min for pizza but it took twelve. Tasted very good and memorable but wish price was 25 percent lower. Good portion size."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant in Scarborough which I would frequent for good fresh Italian.
While there is a wait time, I honestly believe that is worth it since they do not compromise on quality.
The ambience is great, even though it is a smaller establishment.
My order was the chicken parmesan, which was delicious and tomato sauce tasted very fresh.
The Fratelli pizza was also a great choice with excellent flavour and cheesy thin crust.
The dessert could be a bit better, but then again I only tried the cheesecake. Would return to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Second time we go there and still very pleased. The mussels, calamari, risotto and pizzas were all very good. The only drawback is that we felt rushed: the main dish arrived while we were still finishing our appetizers. And the waitress was rushing us a little (trying to remove plates not yet done with, bringing the bill, etc). I know they're busy but it was the end of the night so no need to rush that much anymore !"}
{"text":"My cousin loves Italian food and she recommended Fratelli's a while back so I decided it was time to try it.

From the outside, it doesn't look like much but stepping inside reveals a very charming and intimate setting. We were greeted right away by a very friendly gentleman who set us up at a table by the window. Very nice.

My fellow explorer, Raj, had a craving for pizza all morning and I was more interested in the daily specials on the nearby chalkboard. He chose a white pizza with sausage, rapini, feta, and mozzarella and I chose the spaghetti and meatballs. I've learned to judge restaurants by how well they do the simple things.

Wow! I got a very generous serving of spaghetti and meatballs that tasted delicious! Very well seasoned. Excellent sauce! Raj's pizza was done in their wood burning oven and tasted every bit as good as it looked. Bravo!

We will definitely be back to sample more of their menu!"}
{"text":"I have nothing but excellent things to say about his place. The service was good, the menu selection was fantastic and the prices were excellent! Another bonus was the fact that the portions were massive. I highly recommend the chicken pappardelle, it was out of this world! Would recommend it in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"A very popular local restaurant in the east side of town. The parking can be tricky since there isn't a lot of spaces in front of the restaurant, and you will have to get creative with where to leave your car. The place was packed the whole night, with people waiting in doorway staring down at our table by the door. 

The food itself was great. My risotto siciliano came piping hot and was absolutely delicious. Well seasoned, plenty of melted mozzarella and bursts of fresh flavor from the peas. All my friends enjoyed their dishes, and raved about the desserts they had. The only missing food element was bread.... which I've come to expect from an Italian restaurant (or am I wrong in this assumption?). Someone ordered the steamed mussels as an antipasti, but even that didn't come with any bread. Was there a shortage? What happened there?

The major detraction of the night was the service. Our waiter was very absent for most of the meal after our dishes came. We had to wait for a long time to get the bill, and then wait a long time to use the card machine. We were ready to go, but we couldn't even spot him anywhere. A frustrating way to end an otherwise good night."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 servings of penne alla vodka for me and my family over the phone. They said my order would be ready for pick up in about 15-20 minutes but when I picked it up about 45 minutes later, it was still hot! The restaurant was packed with families and customers dining and it had a great atmosphere. The food itself was amazing and the portions were HUGE! I ended up sharing one portion of penne with my mom and we were so full afterwards! The reason I give it 4 stars is because the restaurant itself was so crowded I can't imagine actually dining in, unless they take reservations. I will definitely try dining though because the food is really authentic and it's hard to find quality Italian food around."}
{"text":"I was brought here for the first time on my birthday. A group of us (6-7 people) went in on a Wednesday night. I believe we did make a reservation or atleast gave them a heads up. The food was delicious but pricey. Small and crowded with the tabling but still had a warm atmosphere. 

I wasn't happy with the service. No smiles, or enthusiasm from our server and no happy welcome even as we entered. I was really disappointed in that department. Felt like the staff were judgemental. Maybe they were having an off night, but I'm curious to see if this happens again if I choose to go in a second time. I believe the  previous reviews about service being not so great are right. The servers have a clear preference for certain customers (maybe regulars I don't know). Wait times were a bit long to pay and get the server to come to our table."}
{"text":"I have been going to Fratelli Village Pizzeria for years. Sam is a true restauranteur. He greets you like family and you leave with a great experience. The staff is super friendly. The night I proposed, my girlfriend and I ate there before I got down on one knee. Its a romantic place with a real wood burning oven. Good wine selection. Good pasta selection. Great value. Have enjoyed it many times."}
{"text":"Wow ... this is totally a hidden gem!! Food was so delicious ! We were one of the first to arrive at 5pm, within minutes the restaurant was filled ! 
One of my top choices in GTA for Italian cuisine ... even though I am not from the area, I would come back for their food & service ! Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"You won't find better pizza in Scarborough. You will Downtown. You will pay Downtown prices in Scarborough for very good Downtown pizza. Know what I mean? Oh, and they serve Italian beer - clever."}
{"text":"They only take reservations for party of 8 or more.  Why?"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices. Get there early because it gets busy. Service is also very very good!"}
{"text":"Lovely place, lovely people. A nice selection of wine for the wine lovers. Had the pizza, was really good. loved how fresh it was. Also had to tiramisu which was a little pricey but good."}
{"text":"My friend highly recommended this place after they went and I had it bookmarked for a short time. I enjoy great Italian and I definitely enjoyed it here! Really cool location by the way, looks small from the outside but very spacious interiorly. The stone oven is visible and focal point behind the counter. It was pretty packed when we arrived but quick turn over and were seated quickly. 

We had the \"shrimp and mussels for two\", veal parmigiana and the daily special - chicken ravioli in gorgonzola cream sauce. Nom nom! However, the waitress stated to us they ran out of the house bread they offer (we were there 1 hr before closing). Though we ordered the pasta which was fresh, cooked to al dente with balanced red sauce and very creamy and smooth cream sauce which a lactose intolerant person should not eat (worth the pain afterwards by the way...) the pizza looked scrumptious at the other tables. I think it warrants another visit . Unfortunately we were too full to try desserts so I can't comment, but I think we will try dessert pizza with the next visit. 

Service was good as well, quick and kept the water topped as well. I love a place that keeps our glasses full. Very clean and intimate, a lot of tables of friends hanging out and enjoying good company and food :) You need to try here!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their pizza is cooked in a special oven. It's small and thin. It's very possible to eat the whole thing. The only downside to this place is they don't deliver and their hours. I wish they were open for lunch every day."}
{"text":"This place is great for a date night or for a family dinner. Really lively but cozy Italian eatery. The pizzas are great bit I am also a huge fan of the spinach salad with cheese and lemon truffle oil. And the tiramisu is awesome. We don't go that often these days because they don't take reservations unless you have a large party (8 more I think) and so waiting can be required because Fratelli's is always packed. Waiting is not a good option with two energetic little boys but they are getting old enough now that we may try it soon."}
{"text":"I was recently here at the East York location at St. Clair and O'Connor and had an okay meal. The other location in Scarborough has gotten good reviews but my experience did not live up to the high praise. 

My friend and I came here after a long day of work to catch up and have a nice dinner. This location used to be called the Crazy Tomato, which sadly closed but I'm glad another Italian restaurant opened up to make use of the wood-burning pizza oven. The setting is okay, very typical of an independent family restaurant with dim lighting and standard issue glasses and utensils. Our server greeted us and brought us water while we made our final decisions. We ordered the steamed mussels to share, which were super tasty and the buttery broth was delicious to dip the complimentary bread into. Yum!! We polished those off in a heartbeat. I ordered Sal's pizza (feta, rapini, spicy sausage, and mozzarella) and my friend had the shrimp papardelle in a tomato sauce. That pasta dish actually comes in a cream sauce but she's lactose intolerant so the server happily took her request to switch it for tomato sauce...That was very nice, very accommodating. Her pasta looked delicious, but my pizza was a little disappointing. Hearing about the wood-burning pizza oven, I expected a crispy tasty pizza, but what I got looked kind of like something I could get at Pizzaiolo or another semi-gourmet pizza place. The crust was half crisp, half chewy, but pretty flavourless. The toppings were tasty in their own right, but all together, they were heavy and didn't really do it for me...There was so much mozzarella, which normally I wouldn't argue about but it just made the pizza so heavy and difficult to eat. There was also feta on it already, so the mozzarella could have been used sparingly...The sausage might have been the biggest disappointment. There was plenty of it on my pizza but it was so average, like cheap store bought sausage. I only finished half of the 11\" pizza and took home the rest. 

The mussels were great, the pasta looked great, but my pizza fell a little short of expectation. I'll definitely come back to try other dishes but don't think I will have the pizza again."}

{"text":"Tonight was a date nite for my daughter and myself and we had the good fortune to visit Fratelli Village and had a wonderful meal! The food was outstanding but beyond that the owner Sal goes above and beyond to ensure you time at his establishment is a good one. We definitely felt like invited guests to Sals house, and we will most definitely return! Our waitress was also top notch and super friendly! Can't wait to return but it will take a while to feel \"unfull!!!\""}
{"text":"Amazing!  The pizza menu is extensive and delicious!  The service is terrific.  It's a great choice for dinner - comfort food at it's best.  Fresh ingredients.  Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"You walk in at 6pm and it was packed. That says something right off the bat when the places nearby are just about empty. We were in a bit of a rush so they offered to do our order \"to go\" but as we ordered, a spot opened up and they offered it to us since we were still there before the others in line. Talk about friendly service!

The pizza was amazing, if you like thin crust. The chicken was above average. I think the downside of how we got in, we didn't get the full service that the others seem to be getting which is why I didn't give this a 5 star but still, overall, a very nice experience for a reasonable price. 

FYI, one pizza and a side order should fill two people fine."}
{"text":"The charm of Sal who works the front of the house and his brotherid who handles the kitchen makes this place. The food is decent - we enjoyed a spinach salad with a lemon truffle dressing and a caesar salad plus some grilled calamari. For the prices paid it was what I would call honest food. The pizzas start at $8 to $15. A medium thick crust - all three of ua ate half the pizza - the other half we just scrapped the toppoing off and ate it. The house made cheesecake is good to share with two. I wanted a bit of spice for the pizza and the waiter gave me a petite pitcher with a very yummy salsa verde sauce. Good place to hang with friends for fun lively conversation. Food is not the focus here but the laid back casual scene is warming. And Sal tells me that a new sign is on order. Careful when driving here - Old Kingston Road and Kingston Road are two separate roads. If following google maps keep to you right - watch for the white overlite strip mall littered with generic signs like restaurant, post office, et al."}
{"text":"VERY busy little space, but the food  was great.  We waited about 15 minutes for a table and squeezed into the bar area to have a glass of wine before being seated.  About 10 people were squeezed into the small entryway waiting for a table as well.  Service was superb, good selection of meaty and seafood items on the menu, decent wines, and delicious looking desserts (we were too stuffed to enjoy dessert!).  
We would definitely return when we are in the area."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Fratelli and it was OK.  I received rave reviews from many friends and thought while I was in town I'd visit.
The location is great and is tucked away in the East end of the city.  The decor is relaxing and clean.  I believe there was a fire recently and thus the renovations.
We thankfully didn't have to wait as there was an available table for two.  They do not take reservations and I've heard (also read) that it can be up to an hour or so some nights for a table.
We started with the antipasto platter and it was just OK.  I've been to many other italian restaurants and the platters are full of great meats and cheese but I just felt it was lacking.  Our bread was also quite hard and wasn't quite nice.  We also ordered the grilled calamari which was drenched in balsamic reduction.  A bit too much for my liking and it overwhelmed the real flavour of the calmari.
We decided to share the Popeye Pizza and the Penne Alla Vodka.  Both entrees were awesome.  Great flavours and I love the thin crust of the pizza.  We were definitely impressed with the entrees.
We were quite full for dessert so didn't order anything but if I do return I'd love to try their dessert pizza!"}
{"text":"This is a great family owned restaurant. Where else will you find the owner who not only greets you but comes around to see if you're okay? We heard about this jewel from friends who had frequented this hot spot for years. We ordered their house red wine with our Sicilian Risotto and pizza funghi. We ended up with the popular tiramisu and creme brulée. The good: Service is wow. I spilled my wine glass ( tight spaces) on my shirt while trying to avoid my winter coat. When I came back from cleaning up my  short, they refilled my glass back to  the top pro bono. Our waitress was super,  she was knowledgeable of every detail especially the specials. THE  Bad: well I spilled the wine on me. The Ugly: They do take reservations but if you dont make one ypu can wait a good 20minutes. Tip tiramisu better choice. It does get crowded on high activity hours so you may need to wait but its worth it. Owner came around and chatted with us to talk about his restaurant. The restaurant begins and ends with the owner...nice.. $$-$$$"}
{"text":"While I have been frequenting this place a lot lately, I had forgotten to write a review. I suppose because wall each time I came the seating and service were so quick, I barely had time to check-in.   Up until this week the service and food were beyond the mere 5 stars offered by Yelp to show our appreciation. However, that all changed Tuesday night when I finally got some time to enjoy a meal with my daughter after her 1st day at University.  

We arrived an hour b4 closing, and the staff was down to the Hostess who seems to also be owner/Mgr? And also doubled as Server/Bartender/Cashier that night - soooo searing is was slow, even though 1/2 the tables were empty. The table was not cleaned, and we sat waiting with no menus. Almost 15 mins from our arrival the friendly buss/server arrived with plates - then left with plates to get a rag to wipe said dirty table. Daughter is wondering why I keep boasting about this place.
A few mins later the unsmiling borderline rude hostess returns with menus and a scowl. 

Her attitude never changed towards us or a table near us - yet she seemed quit cheerful to the few nearby tables of ALL WHITE patrons.  Maybe she was just tired or had a pissy customer b4 we arrived - but she was really very harsh in her tone and mannerism with us. 

I've sent and brought several people here, none white and several mentioned how the service was not as friendly when she is there. Hmmm I don't like to think she is acting that way due to ppl's race - but since she was
Always nice previously - until I arrived with my mini-racial child - well, I may not be returning there. 

The food which was ALWAYS pristine
- was TERRIBLE this week. And it was the same cook! Lamb was undercooked with no flavor and full of fat. The pasta sauce was watery and spaghetti was swimming in water  I swear I saw Phelps doing LAPS in the bottom of the bowl.  My daughter lost her appetite.  

Oh -  she crammed my leftovers into a too small container and smooooooshed the pasta turning it into a slice of Spaghetti-bread which I had to throw in the garbage when I got home 

Really disappointed and I'll certainly never eat there again if I see this scowling fungia face there. 

I was willing to overlook the miniature toilets and unkempt washroom, but no excuse for being rude. 
Especially when the gentleman who seats earlier in the day is extremely Friendly and makes u feel like an invited guest in his home!!"}
{"text":"Lovely Italian restaurant. The owners are supper nice and attentive. 

I've been here twice now for the seafood risotto and fratelli desert ."}
{"text":"3.5 star 

It is not surprising that not too many people knows about or even locate Fratelli Village Pizzeria! Their signs really need some works on!! Almost all the paints are faded and you cannot even make name of the restaurant. 

When you step inside the dinner room, it feels like you have been transferred from Scarborough to one of the downtown bistro. The interior is nicely decorated, tables packed together and dimmed lighting. 

This place is quite packed during lunch time. 

Advice: be sure to check out the specials on the wall, but if you sit at the back of the room like us, you will need supervision in order to see their offerings.. 

Fried Calamari ($8.95) 
- deep fried to golden brown 
- soft and tender and surprisingly not oily at all!! 
- great portion to share.. the sauce can have a little more kick 

Milan's Pizza ($12.95) 
- Tomato Sauce, Grilled Chicken, Sun dried Tomatoes, Feta Cheese, Red Onion and Mozzarella 
- The crust is really light, crispy and thin... I love the crust.. 
- The pizza itself is a little dry, a little more tomato sauce would have help 

I don't think they serve a full menu at lunch as the menu we provided has only pizza and appetizers on them.. 

The service here is friendly and attentive. 

I will definitely be back to try out some of their other offerings especially the Tiramisu!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went here for our anniversary dinner a few weeks back. We've heard amazing things about this spot so were pretty excited to try it out.  I ordered the the margarita (sp?) pizza and my wife ordered a pasta special.  
To the pizza review... I was disappointed.  I spent some time in NJ/NY and this pizza was just meh. Not better than a slice at the local pizza pie joint in jersey.  They had a really great pizza oven, the pie was just disappointing. There was some shredded basil and shredded cheese.  I felt the quality of ingredients was lacking. Just my opinion maybe my expectations were too high, just not my slice of pie.

My wife's pasta was pretty impressive. She had  ricotta filled ravolis with a creamy mushroom sauce. Very tasty and home made. This was an amazing dish.
We shared a great bottle of wine and the atmosphere was great.
I will definitely return and give the pizza another shot. The potential for a great pie is there. Hope it was just an off day."}
{"text":"Embarrassing to say that I live very close to this restaurant for years and only now I got the chance to eat in. 

We arrived around 630pm, and it was already filled up. We waited for about 10mins before being seated. 

Friendly staff, you can tell they are family-owned and have regular costumers. 
We were served quickly and everything tasted AMAZING! The pizza is perfect. I tried the Victoria pizza, and it's probably the best pizza I've ever had!

Parking can be difficult at this plaza, I suggest going across the street to Shamrocks. 

My only complaint is the tables are very close together. You have to be very mindful that you don't accidentally hit the person sitting behind you.

I would come back here again to try the Fettuccine Alfredo, as I heard great things about it from other costumers."}
{"text":"Service is great, food is amazing, I would definitely come back! The dessert pizza is so simple yet so amazing, I'm hooked."}
{"text":"Place isn't bad server was friendly always had our drinks topped up which is huge plus! Will probably come back again."}
{"text":"By...far..my favourite Italian joint!!  But also by far one of my favourite restaurants!! Everyone I've met who has been to this restaurant has heard of it by word of mouth...which now a days, that speaks VOLUMES!! I'm pretty sure this place doesn't even need my review...but I'm going to give it 5 stars anyways because it's THAT GOOD"}
{"text":"This place is my go-to for great Italian food, the hosts are always very pleasant and accommodating, food is amazing I've had everything from pizzas to their pastas there hasn't been anything I didn't like and the prices were more than fair. They have a really unique hot sauce(chilli sauce), it's home made by the owner, no idea what's in it but I'm a fan! Their tiramisu is my weakness, that's the one thing I can't help ordering love it!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Scarborough hands down. And since it's in highland creek, prices are not jacked up to downtown prices. 

If you want to go here let me know, I would most likely be game"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat at Fratelli's at least once per month.  It is by far the best Italian restaurant in the east end.  There is limited seating and they are always very busy.  They take no reservations so be sure to arrive early.

This is the restaurant my wife and I take our out-of-town friends and family to when we want to impress.

Everything on the menu is delicious.  The pizza is my personal favourite.  When it comes to rating other restaurants our question always seems to be, \"Would you rather have gone to Fratelli's?\""}
{"text":"This is definitely the \"It Spot\" for a great Italian meal in the East end! I came in here on a Friday night and there was a line up out the door for tables. They don't take reservations unless your a party over 8 so be prepared to wait. Luckily our wait was only about 15 minutes.

We were seated at a cozy table right beside the bar. The place was packed mostly of couples. It's a rather small restaurant with tables spaced pretty close together but I suppose it makes for intimate dining especially with the dim lighting, exposed brick walls and Frank Sinatra playing in the background.

Our waiter came over with the menus and pointed out the chalkboard on the wall with the nightly specials. We started off with two glasses of Zindfandel as we browsed the menus. Everything looked soo delicious so we just decided to share a bunch of mains.
After placing our order the waiter brought over a basket of fresh sliced whole wheat bread and butter for us to nibble away on as we awaited our feast.

Pizza
We decided on sharing one of there wood burning oven pizza as an appetizer.
Popeye Pizza - Tomato sauce, goat cheese, spinach, prosciutto, and mozzarella
Thin crust pizza with ample fresh toppings arrived probably within 10 minutes fresh out of the oven. I couldn't flaw it, completely delicious!

For mains
Spaghetti Bolognese - Ground beef finished in tomato sauce
Thick chunky meaty sauce with perfectly cooked noodles came out piping hot topped with generously shaved portions of fresh Parmesan

Seared Salmon Filet - Served w/ grilled vegetables with a balsamic reduction
Perfectly cooked generous portion of salmon and grilled vegetables with a nice smokey flavour plus that delicious balsamic another wining main

Everything came out fast, fresh, and piping hot and generous in size!
After that meal we were sooo stuffed but couldn't resist taking a look at the dessert menu

Chocolate Gelato - Two scoops of rich chocolate gelato topped with a strawberry
Washed down with a fresh cup of coffee my o my we need to be wheeled out of the restaurant!

I can totally see why this place is always packed! I'm soo happy it's in my neck of the woods! Fast, fresh, authentic italian food with friendly service what's not to love!
Plus our meal of a pizza, two mains, two glasses of wine, two cups of coffee, and dessert came to less than 80 bucks! It's definitely worth the trek out to the East end!

FYI its located at the end on a strip plaza so parking is limited. Park directly across the street at the CIBC"}
