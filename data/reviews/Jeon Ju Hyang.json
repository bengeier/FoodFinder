{"text":"Don't come expecting high quality food or tip top service. Quite frankly, the food is rather mediocre and the waiters and waitresses frantically run around the restaurant trying to keep the food coming out during the busy hours - waving someone down for service takes some time. The restaurant also doesn't have extensive ventilation so a lot of the oil and grease smell lingers.    Despite its drawbacks, I still return time and time again... why? While I can't say that I have visited many Korean restaurants in Toronto, I can say that of the ones I have been to, none deliver as much value per dollar as Jeon Ju Hyang. Portion sizes are handsome and you can get away with under $10 after tax and tip for most lunch entrees. This is what people should look for at this restaurant, not the quality of food.   Food - 6/10 Service - 7/10 Atmosphere - 7/10 Value - 10/10 Overall - 7.5/10"}
{"text":"Food is not good at all. And the worst part is extremely long waiting time for the food.  None of server will care and no explanation. Unless you want to go somewhere and no one care how long you stay."}
{"text":"Good price, nice spot spot with great service. The Kimchi soup I ordered might have had too much going on in it. I like things simple; next time I'll ask them to hold off on the soft & fried tofus. I love spices but my friend almost choked on the appetizer she ordered. It's pretty neat the variety of panchan (side dishes) that come with tea before they serve your main dish but I'm a bit picky when served cold food typically cook and served hot. I will go back to try their Bulgogi, Korean barbecue and Jeon specialty; if impressed will raise the mark ;)"}
{"text":"Just tried this place out for the first time tonight, and it was pretty good. I'd give it three and a half stars if I could - not sure it's quite at the four-star level (we'll see after I visit a few more times and try more things), but at the very least a good solid 3.   I had bibimbap, which tends to be my usual choice at Korean restaurants - not the dolsot kind, because it's July and way too hot for that, but the regular bowl kind. And it was quite good - nice assortment of vegetables, perfectly done egg, easily on a part with a lot of the places down in Koreatown on Bloor. Not necessarily up there with the very best, but certainly enjoyable. One of the toppings was crispy black seaweed - possibly nori, but not in sheets the way I'm used to seeing it... Anyway, it was an unexpected but tasty addition. And they were not at all put off by my request for no meat in it.  The variety of side dishes was also nice - kimchi (of course), peanuts in a sweet sticky sauce, spicy pickled cucumber (or zucchini? Looked more like zucchini, tasted more like cucumber), a seaweed salad, and two things I couldn't quite identify, but both were really good. One was strips of something pancake-like with bits of some kind of green vegetable in it, and the other was marinated strips of what I first thought was possible extra-firm tofu, and then decided was possibly something fish-based. Fish-tofu? Tofish? I have no idea, but it was good.   Service was a bit rushed, but friendly enough. I did sometimes have to make a bit of an effort to catch the attention of the staff, because they were fairly busy, but they were attentive enough once signalled.   Anyway, overall, I was pretty pleased with the place and I'm sure I'll be back. The tight apartment market in Toronto has temporarily driven me out to the north-northeastern fringe of the city, and it's nice to at least discover that it's got a ton of good Asian restaurants of various sorts."}
{"text":"A go to place if I am in the area.  There aren't too many Korean places in the area and food is not bad.  Good change in cuisine if you always have chinese food.  Prices are standard and service is not bad.  Would give 4 stars if the waitresses doesn't give dirty looks when asking for refills on the side dishes."}
{"text":"Although the food is good (the cucumber kimchi side dish is awesome), I am not coming back after finding hair in my Gamjatang. I also had to tell the waitress to take it off my bill. They did offer to give me a new bowl of gamjatang, but it probably would have came from the same batch the hair was in, so I declined."}
{"text":"Usually when we come here to eat it is not crowded so food comes quickly but the last time we came there were maybe 3 more tables than usual and suddenly they took at least 20 min to come out whereas it would usually take half the time. However, when we asked where our food was and told them we were in a rush, they said they were just starting it then. We had ordered 3 combos, $10.99/ea and 4 people were sharing it but the bill came out to have charged us for 4 combos and we left without noticing they had indeed ripped us off. Service needs work."}
{"text":"I ordered Beef Tofu, my favorite one. Good food, good service. Accepted credit card pay"}
{"text":"Aweful service.  No tea, no water, slow service.  Bad artitude. Never ever come here again. Waiting on the table for over 20 min with no water or tea."}
{"text":"Korean food at its best.my opinion. Food is fresh and hot . service is fast and friendly. My new fav family hangout."}
{"text":"I am a meatlover. I just saw ads for korean bbq restaurant in chinese newspaper. Jeonju hyang has a special bbq promotion 20%off until 2016.Oct.15 So i went there for a dinner with my family. We ordered beef bulgogi and chicken bulgogi with some side dishes. The bulgogi was so fresh and delicious. The waitresses are friendly and fast to serve. It is great place to have a time for dinner with watching TV."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for more than 5 years and ownership has changed multiple times during that period. Food has gone downhill while prices have continued to go up. After today's service and experience, I won't be going back. For some reason they ran out of spoons so I had to drink hot soup from a plastic one! For a second, I thought I was eating in a food court."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Gives a lot of side dishes. But the food can be a bit expensive ($25 for the teppan noodle platter)"}
{"text":"Average would be the best word to describe this place. The food isn't outstanding, service is decent and prices are fair.  I would definitely come back because I feel the prices are good for the food you are getting. $8 for a pork bone ramen, nice deal for a filling dinner!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on the weekend with a group of friends after passing by it often.   The food was delicious, banchan (sides) were delicious, and service was great even though the place was packed! Prices were fair as well. Definitely will come back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"This place has gotten much better since the grand opening, I was quite impressed. They have a big variety of side dishes and the portions are not as small as they used to be. You get three refills on the side dishes. It is a bit pricier but if you order the right combo, you definitely get your money's worth. The quality of the food has also gotten better. Their sweet rice drink (traditional korean drink) is also delicious. Service was great, no complaints. I will definitely be coming back this time. Glad we gave it a try again."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times that I've lost count.  From the time they opened the staff here have always been so nice & kind, always accommodating as well.  Service is always timely, each time I've been here.  The food is delicious, better than other Korean restaurants I've tried around the Yonge & Finch to Yonge & Steeles area (if you love Korean as much as I do, you will know which ones are the popular ones I'm referring to). Prices are fair for the amount (generous portions) and quality (soooo delicious!). I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes after my order before I had to complain so they would check to find out they forget about it. All my friends have finished their food and are waiting for me."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Korean restaurant chain...I usually go to the bamburgh circle location but saw this sign pop up while driving by recently. Its located at Midland and mcnicoll between the Popeye and Starbucks..can't be.missed. inside is big, bright and clean. I love that they give tons of banchan (Korean sides)...unlike some places..(lookin at you owl)...and the owner was kind enough to let us try a complimentary korean rice drink. Service was attentive and we never felt rushed to leave. Food is also good...not a big fan of my fried squid hence I took one star off. But my friends fried chicken was really yummy and my ramen was exactly what I needed after a long day at work! The owner said the difference between them and bamburgh is that they also have Korean bbq. I will be returning for sure:)"}
{"text":"Really excited that this place opened close to home, now we don't have to go as far for decent Korean food. Convenient location and the pork bone soup was enjoyable. Easy to find parking as the lot is huge. The menu seems to also have a lot of selection (although I've only tried one thing, which was the pork bone soup). The side dishes were also decent, the only thing was they had the potatoes as a side dish and it looked really dried up from the frying."}
{"text":"As a visitor to the GTA area, a friend of mine took me to Jeon Ju Hyang for a quick bite to eat.  The food was definitely mediocre and as many of reviewers have previously expressed, cheap for good sized portion.    After paying with my debit at the counter, I headed back to my table to take out some additional change to add to my paper bill tip.  Before I could even retrieve my change purse, and still standing by my table, a waitress came running over exclaiming something and pointing at my debit receipt.  It all happened so quick, I thought she was trying to say the transaction was denied, which I explained to her the transaction was approved.  The waitress then aggressively and loudly declared that the tip was not included.  Still not understanding her intentions, I confirmed this, \"Yes, I did not add the tip on there.\"  The waitress then escalated, stating this is the policy for me to tip at least 10% and even though it is not automatically added to my bill or shown on their machine, I needed to pay this amount and I did not do this on the debit machine.  I explained to her that I am retrieving cash in which she cut me off to say that they do not get taxed on tips earned through debit/credit transactions and I must pay the 10% tip.    Both shocked and appalled I handed her a $5 bill, far below the typical 18-20% tip I usually leave.  The waitress abrasively asked me if I wanted any change.  I told her this was not necessary as I no longer wanted to interact with her.    As someone who relied on earning tips in the food & hospitality industry to complete grad school, I am the first person to insist on a 15-20% tip, if not more, when receiving service is necessary.  This experience has been utterly appalling to say the least, and I will most certainly not be recommending any of my friends to come back here.    As a caution to potential diners, be prepared for a 10% unwarned charge to your bill to avoid this unprofessionally handled, embarrassing, and overall rude experience."}
{"text":"I went with two friends last year. I remember that I got the jjamppong, and there were a variety of side dishes.  I came here again with two friends this year. I ordered the dolsot bibimbap with yukhoe, kimbap, and a grilled fish. They were pretty decent and it was overall a good experience.  I came here again for the 3rd time with a friend whose hometown is in Jeonju. I ordered mul naengmyeon. He loves gamjatang and must order a gamjatang every time he goes to a Korean restaurant so he ordered gamjatang. I honestly did not enjoy the naengmyeon at all. I let my friend have a taste and he said they don't know how to make mul naengmyeon. So that's the story."}
{"text":"Service could be a lot better. But I love how they offer a variety of side dishes. Haven't tried everything on the menu but I usually order the tofu or pork bone soup"}
{"text":"Came here after badminton. I ordered the small-size spicy fried chicken, which while workable didn't have the kick or flavour that I was used to with other Korean establishments. The restaurant didn't have their LLBO licence, which proved problematic as I wanted to order beer with my fried chicken. I should've ordered something else, judging from how my friends by and large enjoyed their dishes.  The restaurant was nice and clean inside and service was fairly decent.  Note: if you want to refill your banchan (side dishes), you get a choice of three of out six (?) possible dishes. I would definitely call the pancakes a highlight of these dishes."}
{"text":"NOT AUTHENTIC!  Me and my bros went to this place to have dinner and we were SO disappointed. We ordered 3 dishes - Ginseng Chicken Soup, Pork Ribs Galbi (Grilled pork ribs) and Jajang noodle  Ginseng Chicken Soup - it shouldn't be called ginseng if there is no ginseng in the bowl. The traditional way to make ginseng chicken soup is the chicken is stuffed with rice or sticky rice, ginseng, garlics, well... there's none. Also they added lots of seasoning to the soup which SHOULD'T BE. F-  Pork Ribs Galbi - well I should say Pork Chop Galbi, because they didn't give us any pork ribs at all, the taste was not bad though C-  Jajang noodle - they added some chinese ingredients to the dish, such as bok choy and wood year mushroom , the taste was bland. F-  Side dishes - we were told that we can only have 3 dishes refilled??? Are you kidding me?  Seems like the owner has changed and I heard the waiters and waitresses talking to each other in mandarin. If you want authentic korean food, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"don't fill up on the banchan, now! except...you most definitely can - they offer about 6-8 appetizer varieties and are happy to refill. all portions are pretty generous too; they don't skimp. the GAM JA TANG pork bone soup warms you up good on a chilly night. everything else is tasty, but forgettable."}
{"text":"The pork bone ramen soup is my new favourite Korean dish from this place. And with a price of $7.99 with all the side dishes, u can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I only come here for Korean food if I happen to be around the area and am having a serious craving for Korean cuisine. The price of the food here is a little more expensive than other places I've tried, and I find that they don't have that much of a selection of Korean food compared to other places I've been to. I've tried their pork bone soup, chicken katsu and bibimbap. Service here is sometimes good and sometimes bad. When they're super busy, servers will ignore you and it's a pain in the butt getting a refill on water or on the side dishes. Which I should mention, they only let my table get refills once, and the side dishes aren't the best either. The food tastes decent, no complaints there, but again, they should offer more Korean dishes and should think about lowering a few of their dishes as it more expensive than other restaurants (their seafood Korean pancake for example)."}
{"text":"If you guys want to try the worst pork bone soup in Scarborough, or even in Toronto maybe, then you can come try it out. Otherwise stay away from this restaurant. The appetizers make me feel like I went to North Korea to eat grass roots because the appetizers are that cheap and disgusting, I didn't even want to swallow some of them, and it made my experience with the main course even worse."}
{"text":"I really love eating korean food, but unless I'm really desparate and don't want to go far away from where my friends live...I would come here. The food is cheap...But the food itself is very very average. I like their side dishes a lot though. You can choose a lot of different dishes, but the taste is missing some kick. Service is quick and you almost never need to wait long. I always get the pork bone soup, while my friends love the bbp. I appreciate the spice level of the soups though. However, it can be so spicy that I taste nothing else."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch around 1:30pm and it wasn't too busy, so the staff was very attentive and friendly. We ordered the gamja tang hot pot for 2 and the broth was soo flavourful and delicious. We also ordered a small fried chicken which wasn't bad, and portions were quite big for a small compared to other Korean restaurants I've been to for fried chicken. The only thing that I didn't like was the appetizers. It looked very delicious but tasted very bland and dry, especially the glass noodles. Besides this, I really loved everything else! I would definitely return and try their other options on their menu like their soon dubu, dakgalbi, and spicy ramen! So excited to go back"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night, location is big didn't have to wait for seat.  Fried chicken with soya sauce and garlic was very good. Chicken is moist and juicy. Chicken remain crunchy even after it went cold.  Chicken ginseng soup was not the same as the picture, was only half the chicken with no ginseng taste. But the soup still taste good and was refreshing.  Stone pot rice was decent as well, but next time I would opp for the cooked beef over the raw. It was pretty dry when the beef was cooked.  There is also BBQ here which I will come back and try on another time."}
{"text":"Eh. Service was weird, she kept taking away our stuff when we asked for other condiments/hot water. They also seemed to be understaffed because service took a long time and the lady said \"crazy!\" while huffing and puffing when she reached our table to take our orders. The food was mediocre, really nothing special. The udon was a ripoff. For $9.99, it wasn't even flavorful and the portion size was pretty small for dinner.  I think they changed management because I no longer recognize any of the employees and they now speak Mandarin.. This restaurant seems to have lost its authenticity.  The only thing I liked about this place was how they gave a variety of side dishes. I probably won't be coming here again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I don't usually crave Korean food but after seeing the Yelp photos of all the different side dishes, I was compelled to come here and try it out!   As the second location of Jeon Ju Hyang (the original one is at the Bamburgh Circle plaza), this restaurant was cleaner and better renovated. I came late night ~9pm and only a few tables were seated so it was nice and not too loud. While there was only 1 waitress working at the time, she was attentive and it was never a problem to flag her down when needed.   Let's start with what I came here for - the side dishes. I'm definitely not going to say that they were the most delicious side dishes I've ever had BUT I was still very content with having that variety and getting to sample all those different flavours! I particularly liked the pickled cucumber and kimchi because they weren't too spicy, perfect for lil' weakling me.   As a party of 3, we ordered:  Japchae and rice with beef ($12). The rice didn't have enough flavour in my opinion but it was sizzling hot and the overall presentation was visually appealing. Be careful not to touch the pot anywhere (handles included) or you might burn yourself! Learn from my mistakes.  Galbi Tang ($16). The soup broth was nice and savoury and the pieces of short rib were large and tender. I think this would be a great comfort food as it was pipping hot and very satisfying. However, I find the price here to be rather steep.. at other Korean restaurants that make this dish comparably well, it only costs $10~12.   \"Snack Combo\" ($15). So the combo allows you to pick one dish from each of 2 lists, A and B, plus a drink. I chose Gimbap + Jajangmyeon +  Coke but there are many other options for you to choose from. Given the word \"snack\", I assumed they would be giving \"snack-sized\" portions of each of the two dishes but NOPE, they were essentially full-sized dishes and it was quite a hefty amount of food! The gimbap was tasty but a little bland in my opinion so if you eat it with kimchi or other side dishes, it really gives it that additional kick of flavour. The jjangmyeon was alright too, nothing special there.  Overall rating of food 4/5.  Overall rating of price 2/5."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but I had to wait 40 mins for my food after I order and the. The food was decent. The fried sweet and sour chicken was very doughy and sticky and not crunchy. But I love that the kimbap was beautifully presented and they also offer 3 different proteins; chicken, beef and veggie. Even thought veggie isn't a protein LOL. But the server didn't know enough English for me to communicate with them, which was also really hard to figure what I wanted to eat."}
{"text":"It would give this place a 3.5 or maybe 4 stars before last night. As the food had been pretty good and quality had been consistent. It is also close to my place.    However I was very unimpressed last night. I walked in at 11pm and I made sure to see what time it closed (at 12am) so I wouldn't be keeping them from closing on time. I ordered soon tofu as usual. When the food came, I knew it was not right from seeing the colour of it. The broth was not like the usual bright orange colour, it was much lighter and it almost looked like they spilled some chilly oil to add some spice in it. I tried it anyway before making a judgement because I could be wrong. The soon tofu was tasteless so I called the lady server over and told her. She had a hard time understanding me I guess due to language barrier, she thought I was complaining about not enough seafood/mussels. After trying to tell her what was wrong for a few minutes, she took it back to the kitchen and brought another one back in 10 minutes. This time the soon tofu looked more like usual but still not as great. I felt that because they wanted to close early maybe, that was why that made the food in a rush or simpler way? There was a party of 10 walked in 30 minutes before closing and I saw the lady server was shock... It's a shame because I go there few times a week and now I don't know if I want to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"One of my favourite korean places around. Lots of side dishes provided as well as refills. Price is good too! The lunch special I got was chicken bulgogi, $9.99"}
{"text":"Been here around 3 times since it opened. Always had a pleasant experience each time. There is a 10% off coupon in the Chinese newspaper.   Each time I come here I always get the snack combo. Its 2 dishes from a relatively diverse list of korean dishes. A drink of pop or herbal drink is included as well. I've tried the ramen, katsu, gyoza and the skewers.   The ramen is yummy and suitable for a cold day. The katsu is a little on the dry side. The gyoza has a nice meaty flavour. The skewers came a bit cold but it was good value for the price.   The service is quite friendly and they came around giving us free rice drinks which was nice. The appetizers are also great! I absolutely love the honey potatoes, so addicting!   Overall, its a nice, spacious Korean joint to try out and I look forward to the next time i come here."}
{"text":"There's a reason why Owl managed to do so well. I don't think I can ever see a franchise coming out of this. I don't mean any disrespect, but the food just want that great. Sure, there was a lot of variety, but it wasn't great. The meat in my pork bone soup was dry.. I mean, how is that possible? It's a soup with dry meat? Wtf.. It was probably sitting there for a while and they reheated it. Taste was.. Mehh. I was not impressed that night, or maybe I had one of those PMS nights.. I'll try it again and see how it goes. Still need to try the pork bone ramen.. But I can't justify the price (7.99) for ramen + maybe 1-2 bones.. Getting the PB with rice means I get 3 bones at least!"}
{"text":"Craving Korean on a cold day and this one was closest at that moment.  The service and overall ambiance was nice. Clean and spacious.  Quick glance at the menu and what caught my eye was the ramen in gamja tang, I mean really what could go wrong right? Wrong.  I get it that traditionally \"ramen\" in Korean is usually instant noodles. Ok that's fine, I mean the pic was the same. What I didn't expect was the soup was the instant pack that came with the noodles. I had expected pork bone soup. Not instant noodle soup with pork bones. Portions were pretty big tho.  The banchans were ok. The kimchi could have been spicier. I did however really like the onion pancake banchan.  Not enough wow factor."}
{"text":"(More like a in between rating between 3-4 but definitely leaning toward 4)   I came here on a Tuesday afternoon with a friend and we were pretty much the only people in the restaurant. At first glance, the restaurant is a big, and clean space with tons of tables and many seats. We ordered the bulgogi on the hot plate with rice, and also the tang su yuk (sweet and sour pork). The bulgogi was flavourful, and it was a large portion. Definitely worth your money ($13.99). The pork was also quite a big portion (we got the small size for $8) BUT it wasn't as crispy as I would like.  The service here was also pretty good and you get free refills on 3 of your side dishes!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for some quick lunch. This place has been around my neighbourhood for some time. Somehow we managed to fit 16 people in the restaurant. Anyway, we ordered our food and not long after all the appetizer dishes came right out. I still think that's the best part of the meal. I was looking over their menu, and realized there's too many choices and so I played it safe by ordering a fried rice. It was... okay? Big portion but the taste is just... okay. There's nothing thrilling about it. Will I come back? Maybe a lot of convincing from my friends."}
{"text":"Five years ago I would have given this place a full 5 stars. However, food quality seems to have gone downhill. My soon tofu was asked to be extra spicy and yet it came out bland... Not a problem, I asked for hot sauce and they nicely delivered, except adding the large amount of hot sauce didn't help whatsoever. Seemed like I just added more red colored dense oil (without any flavor and definitely not spicy). Usually I love the taste of soon tofu and this was not only not spicy, but too bland.  It feels less authentic now than five years ago when I came here often. The owners have changed, I hear the young workers speaking Chinese whereas before the workers were these older Korean ladies. However, they are still very polite and courteous in greetings so that adds a star to make it 3*.  The prices have increased but that is expected over the years... except soon tofu even at a more prime location than Bamburge circle, such as Yonge Finch aka Korea town, is still around $6.99 to 8.99 max, but here it is now 9.99 which I wouldnt even complain if it weren't so bland. The good thing that stayed was they still serve you 9 glorioius banchan dishes, and you are allowed 3 of them to be replenished."}
{"text":"I completely agree with some of the reviews here, especially about the service and quality of the food. Firstly, I don't understand why they found the need to deliver boiling hot food on the side of the table that's already full and tell us to just pass it along. We had 6 people and they said we can't refill all the sides, we could only choose 3. The food is mediocre at best. This used to be a decent place but I can't stand it now."}
{"text":"Actually I am living around this area and I have been going to this restaurant so many times at the past with my family. But I was very disappointed this time since the price went up and the portion is getting small. The service was so so and when we want to get more side dishes, they said we can only choose 3 out of 7 kinds and only one time refill. Therefore over all I think this restaurant can only deserve 2 stars."}
{"text":"I am always on the hunt to find a good Korean food place that can satisfy my Korean food cravings.  I came into the restaurant with a party of 4 and we were promptly seated at a table.  The restaurant was quite empty for a Saturday evening which doesn't quite explain why parking was so difficult to find...but I digress.  We ordered the bibambap, seafood soon tofu and bulgogi stew.  I should mention that we were starving by then and thankfully they had very generous side dishes.  In fact, this is the most side dishes I have ever been served (7!).  Not to mention, they didn't skimp on the portion sizes for the side dishes and were quick to get refills when we asked.  I can only comment on the bulgogi stew I ordered and it was mediocre, the bulgogi was a bit too thick but flavors were decent.  There was a lot of oil sitting in the soup after I was done eating so I don't think I'd order this dish again."}
{"text":"For dinner, we came in where my friend noticed the Korean patrons along with Korean servers.  Thinking of this fact, I thought this place would be half decent but then again I thought that there aren't too many Korean traditional restaurants within the radius aside from Korean BBQ which is another category on it's own.  There was a good variety to choose from on the PHOTO menu which helps me to get an idea of what I'm eating even though it had Cantonese written on it as well as English.  I had to order the Cold Noodle($7.95) and it was NORMAL in terms of noodle and garnishes but the soup was not as COLD as other places where they even put ice or slush in the bowl.  The Pork Bone Soup(around $6-7) was typical as well and was served BUBBLING hot, aside from that even for me it was not as SPICY as other places and that speaks a lot for someone that gets a bit sensitive when things turn spicy.    I think others might want to REQUEST more spice level when they order this item.  I asked my friend why he took ALL the potatoes, and he told me he didn't as I only saw one piece sitting in the bottom of the bowl.  The Dolsot Bibimbap($9.95) seemed on par as well until I DUG around 5 minutes after it was served and notice not much rice became CRISPY.  This mysterious phenomenon might be unsolved as the stone bowl should normally do a pretty decent job from my limited experience.  The service was okay and we were greeted coming in and going out.  If you visit your washroom, you'll see around 30 bags of Korean rice in the hallway.  The setting was nothing fancy as you can see from Jen K's photos.  2.5 STARS for this specific experience.  Might be back to try the BEEF as I'm a fan of Korean Beef dishes."}
{"text":"Simply put, Jeon Ju Hyang is mediocre quality Korean food that will satisfy your cravings. I suspect that their chefs are in rotation, because there are days when I would order a bibimbap and it would have abundant flavor and veggies and be beautifully plated.. and then there are days when they put raw chunks of lettuce in it. It's like a complete 180! They definitely need to be more consistent with their food quality. I can't say the food tastes bad, but I can't say it tastes amazing either.   If you're cheap, order from the combo menu to get your bang for your buck. It's $10.99 for two dishes with a can of pop. I recommend trying their dukkboki and their kimbap.   Here they provide a plethora of side dishes; usually 7-8. But unfortunately they do not serve unlimited side dishes unlike many other Korean restaurants. You only get to choose 3 refills, so consume wisely."}
{"text":"Worst Korean restaurant I have ever been to.  Food has no taste at all. Staff gave us attitude when asked to fix it and ignored our request."}
{"text":"Went for quiet Sunday lunch.  Great service from our waitress. We ordered hot stone pot rice, galbi rice, seafood pancake.  Everything tasted ok. Got 8 banchan dishes and 3 free refills.  And free sweet rice drink at the end. Liked this new location better than the one at Warden and Steeles. Good korean place without having to trek to Yonge and Finch. Would visit again next time to try the 2 snack combo."}
{"text":"I have heard many good things about the restaurant and finally able to come try it with my co workers. The restaurant was quiet, nice and clean, bright and spacious. I ordered #33 tofu beef soup served with rice $9.99. We received 8 side dishes which was nice. Love the everything, the potatoes, japchae, beans etc. They allowed us to refill 3 dishes of our choice. Food was nice and hot, plus tasty. My co workers enjoyed the food. Next time I would like to try something else.  I will be back !"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times for Korean food and seems to be popular staple in Scarborough especially in the Bamburgh plaza which is quite a popular hotspot in the area so it can get quite busy here. In terms of prices, it's quite reasonable. They usually have combos where it comes with 2 dishes and a drink which is popular and worth the money. Usually I order the spicy rice noodles and the chicken katsu as I think those 2 are the best dishes in their combo deals. You also get a pop included in this combo and all of this is for $13 or so. You can also order other dishes as they have quite an extensive menu selection. Not sure why there are so many bad ratings here but the experience I've had here has mostly been positive. Overall, a decent place to get some Korean food. Service was alright. Food is cheap and decent."}
{"text":"I am extremely impressed with this place and it's one of the very few instances where I feel the yelp score is too low. The quality is not phenomenal (no where close to song cooks) but this place does offer a good selection of good Korean food. It's simple and it's delicious.   Off the bat, I was impressed with their menu, which is quite rare for me because I am almost never impressed with the menu at a korean place. Usually it is very standard but there was everything you would want here, and the prices are fairly good. Not every Korean place offers kalbi Jim, albap KFC, kimbap, hot pots, etc. I had a difficult time choosing what to get because I wanted to try everything haha  I ended up getting their kalbi jim, it is a beef short rib stew and it was nice and sweet and was served with assorted veggies like bell peppers, mushrooms and carrots. There was a good amount of meat, and the I loved the sweet/salty flavour from the jujubes and soy sauce. I wouldn't say the meat was super tender (due to the nature of the cut) but was good enough and was fall off the bone.   My friend got ramen and that was also good. It is your standard instant noodle ramen. No complaints? That's what they use.   There was a healthy amount of banchan and I enjoyed all of them. Props to them for offering pajeon, one of my favourites. Also, the miyeok was great, it was doused in a sweet red dressing (and tasted like salad dressing that is offered at many Japanese places). Disappointed not to get oisobagi kimchi which is another one of my favourites, I did see it in a few other photos but we didn't get it. Can't get them all I suppose.  I am definitely returning and will adjust my rating if I feel their experience is not up to par to my first outing."}
{"text":"While I didn't have as pleasant of an experience at this Jeon Ju Hyang compared to the original Bamburgh Circle location, I still think this place is an average place for passable Korean food in the area.  I really liked just how spacious this restaurant is and how they had two big screen TVs. They have a really good menu here with almost everything on it for everyone and some decent specials.   Their banchan side dishes were okay. Nothing was special. The kimchi was good here, I'm not sure why some others have been hating on their kimchi.   We ordered the japchae rice, gamjatang, and some soy garlic fried chicken.   I was pretty disappointed with the gamjatang. The broth just wasn't right and the meat on the pork bones were shredding, almost as it was cooked too long.   The fried chicken was decent, somewhat crispy and the soy and garlic on top was quite savory. At the least the chicken was served piping hot!  The japchae rice was pretty much how you expect it to taste - like a pseudo bibimbap with japchae and bulgogi. It was sweet and served on a piping hot pan, so the rice on the bottom was crisping up. Not bad at all.   I'm not sure what to make of this place overall. The food isn't entirely consistent here and it depends on what you get that can define your experience of this place. I'm definitely a bigger fan of their original location."}
{"text":"I used to come to this place alot when they first opened, but they changed the chief and the taste was off. I decided to give them one more chance after a year and the taste is definitely better, however still not the same as before. We usualmy get the cheese chicken with noodle for 2 pplp for $24.99. The other option is with rice for same price. It comes with alot of veggies in a stone plate. It wasnt overily spicy for me but I can take spice. You can definitely ask for no/little spice. I thought the portions are huge. It also comes with 8 banchans (side dish) and you can refill 4 of then. The pancake with the kimchi is the best. Service is quick and tendative. I was quite thirsty when I got home cuz in my opinion I thought there was a little too much msg. Food came out hot."}
{"text":"To be honest this place is more like a 3.5 but no half stars on yelp :( It's better than your average 3 stars but nothing was exceptionally good where it would be 4 stars.  I came here with two on my friends and we spilt four dishes in total. There were several dishes on the menu to choose from but there were a few items that were not available including a drink we wanted to try, so that was kind of disappointing. Being a Korean restaurant they gave us side dishes, they were pretty standard. As for our food, we ordered a snack combo for 11.99 which is two snacks with a drink (we got ddeokbokki and beef skewers), Japchae rice and Maneul Ganjang chicken (fried chicken with garlic soy sauce) in a small size for 9.99. Everything was pretty good but also pretty average. The waitresses were nice and service was fine.  Overall this place is pretty good and I might come again. But I would only come again if a friend or a group of people wanted to go other than that I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here unless my friend drags me back here again.  Cool. First review."}
{"text":"MochiPopcorn Rating Chart Averaged 5 Star Rating rounded down.   Time: 5pm Date: Long Weekend Monday Party: 2 Time to Seat : Instant Crowd Level : Low  Food / Quality Rating - 3.5 / 5  1st Dish : Beef Galbi Jjim: seasoned beef short ribs with soy sauce, chestnut , jujube, and vegetables. Comes with a side of rice.  Sauce was sweet like honey soy , didn't see any chestnuts, had one jujube, but there were other vegetables. Taste was good given the sweet honey flavor. Beef was chewy.  2nd Dish : Gamja tang and mackerel combo.  Gamja tang supplied a large portion of pork bone which was satisfying. The used of lots of the little peril seeds which gave it an authentic feel. Mackerel was standard, did not stand out.  Other : Side dishes seemed like standard store bought items, but customers can only refill 3 out of 6 dishes during the seating.   Portion size was good.   Staff/Service Rating - 3 / 5 Given the low crowd level, service staff were able to seat us quickly and provide adequate attention when customers request refills/order/check.   Staff did not seem enthusiastic but we're fine in meeting the needs of customer.   Environment Rating - 3 / 5 Service areas for customers are well kept.

{"text":"All time favourite place for Korean food, hooked on the appetizers basically.  I have been coming here since it opened, and although the prices have increased drastically, the flavour is still great.   Favourites: Ice cold soba noodles Chicken hotplate with rice cake (non-spicy)-- 2 person order  Bulgogi noodle soup  Gimgap (Beef)  Spiced Pork belly hot plate + soup combo($30) ^ I am biased for this one, the owner noticed that my family did not know how to properly cook the pork belly, so he proceeded to stand in front of our table grill the meat for us. Great service!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with the fam at around 1:30/2:00 pm and overall, it's not a bad place for some korean food. I read some reviews before trying this place out and it seems like many people are saying that their service is slow or wuteva and the food is bland but I disagree with all of that. Yeah, maybe it's because I came at around a less busy time, but my food came in like 10 mins max and my food was pretty flavourful so it's like huh? Okay.  But anyways, I got the sweet rice drink (I think that's what it is called) and the samgyetang. I pretty much enjoyed both of them. The drink was not overpoweringly sweet which I liked and I think there was a slight alcohol taste which was quite a nice touch. Samgyetang wise, this one tastes so much better than the one I had at Nak Won. BUT this one doesn't have sticky rice in it which was like BRUH IT AINT SAMGYETANG WITHOUT THE GOD DAMN STICKY RICEZ. Oh and the menu said there was ginseng. That's a bunch of LIES. Not one ginseng was spotted AND there was not even a slight taste of it either. It's like well done you guys. Thanks for playing me like that. But other than these two screw ups or wuteva, I still liked it.   SO YEAH. Generally, an okay place for korean food. Would I come again? Not voluntarily, but that doesn't mean this place ain't good. They have a pretty sweet deal on the menu. For $11.99 or something, you get to choose two different snacks (from things like ramyun to tteokbokki!!) and it includes a drink too.   p.s. their banchans were pretty meh though .... a lot of them looked dry and lifeless (like me woo jks)  p.s.s. their workers could be more enthusiastic and just alive ...they look pretty dead (like me no jks)"}
{"text":"Came here Thursday night and it wasn't really busy at all. Came in got sat down and I was surprised at the menu... It was pretty expensive for Korean food. Cheapest thing was about $10 which is not that cheap for Korean food by a Chinese owned restaurant. I ordered the soondubu jigae and it tasted alright. It definitely had some Chinese flavors, particularly I noticed lots of onion and garlic. I think the only good thing about this place is that it has like 9 side dishes but you can only refill once for 3 of the side dishes. I really enjoyed the banchan the most.   I don't think I'll be coming here again just because I'd like to try other places but not the worst food you can get in the area."}
{"text":"I came here and ordered the ramen + mandu combo which also comes with a choice of pop (coke, sprite, diet coke, root beer, and ice tea) the ramen was the Grocery store orange package ramen you can buy at foodymart next door, but well made. In addition there is an Egg and seaweed. Dumplings are good. Soft and sauce is ok. Service is good and freindly. Atmosphere is welcoming and asian. Good overall."}
{"text":"Great home cooked korean food for cheap prices. Banchan were plenty and great variety.  I ordered the beef gimbap and ramen combo. Also the gamchatang. Flavourful and delicious.  Ramen was mediocre. Tasted like packaged instant ramen with an added egg.   Pork bones were huge and soup piping hot.   Would come back again."}
{"text":"This place is the second restaurant and newer than the original location (Bamburg Circle).  Getting the tried and true dishes are never a disappointment. Gam ja tang  is always good. Beef gim bap is nice and warm when ordered.   Banchan are always nice and tasty. A lot of assortment and refills are available when asked.  I have been to this location twice. A good place when you are craving snack foods from watching too much k dramas and just want bibimbap, or ddokbokki.  Would come back.  Servings are always generous. And I find that you can order 1 dish less than the number of people eating. Unless you have big appetites.  I tried many dishes like LA galbi which was nice and tender. Cold bibim noodles which are an alternative to bibim nengmyeun."}
{"text":"Food was only okay. Costumer service was BAD BAD BAD. One of the servers was so rude ! She freaked out just because I ordered to refill the side dishes second time. The first time they only gave us 3 pieces in each small dish. And we were three people! Disappointment ++++"}
{"text":"You're not going to find much better Korean food in the area that's open late (midnight?). For what it's worth I think these guys are pretty decent. You get a lot of bang for your buck here and with it comes a lot of freebies (those little side dishes they give). The Korean staples pork bone soup here is average but you do get a decent portion considering the price. What this place really has going for them is value and the assortment of complimentary sides. This is one of those rare places where the sides might just tilt your judgement of the mains.  I have to commend them on their service which is above Korean standards (not very high) however I am inclined to think that these folks are probably a good mix of Korean/Chinese. For those who don't know, it's not uncommon to encounter Koreans that speak Chinese and vice-versa, especially in the restaurant scene. They also have fantastic combos of soup and grilled mackerel for dinner and various combos for lunch. Both are well priced and provide you with ample food.  All in all a great Korean place in the area. Visit if you are craving Korean but don't want to drive too far."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday around 7:30pm and it was about 80% full.   The servers were attentive, however you had ask for things more than once sooo that was a tad annoying.   The food was tasty and it came with I think 9 side dish, who I found bigger than other place, portion wise and you're only able to get one refill. BOO   The three of us order pork bone soup and two other soups and one of us ordered bimbibap, but that wasn't anything special.   Prices were about average in my opinion."}
{"text":"Good portions and good tasting food. It's a fairly spacious restaurant and the staff are quite friendly here.  I mostly go for the pork bone soup which they give you a lot of meat and bones and the soup is so good!! It just warns you right up, especially on chilly nights :)  Its a good place to go for a quick bite or a nice inexpensive meal with groups of friends"}
{"text":"Bad food paired with rude service. Received a tasteless soon tofu soup. Staff refused to bring it back to kitchen to add more seasoning. Disappointing experience."}
{"text":"March 30, 2018 - Firsttimer - The side dishes came first, I really liked the potatoes  & kimchi. We wanted to order more sides, but we were only allowed a second order of two items only for free and anything after that you would have to purchase. I paid about $25 for my ribs which was a bit pricey. But the food was good overall. I liked how my ribs tasted"}
{"text":"This is a borderline ok place for a quick bite but there are a lot of better places with better prices. The side dishes were plenty but they limit side dish refills to three dishes after. I ordered the Kam jang tang and noticed it had onions and other ingredients you don't normally see at other restaurants. It also had a slight sweet taste to it which was weird. My sister got bulbogi bibambap and that was pretty plain. The egg was also overcooked (runny yolk is always a must for us).   Wasn't too impressed with the food. Not terrible but not that good either."}
{"text":"Service is very friendly and food was delicious! I ordered the snack combo ($11.99) with the spicy noodle and fried squid and also fried chicken for two people and it was super filling - we had tons of leftovers. The spicy noodle which is a cold dish was very refreshing. We also had several side dishes in the beginning. Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant I frequent a lot with my family as it is quite an affordable place to eat at. The restaurant itself is very spacious and there is a ton of space within the booths/tables as well.  The place is kept pretty clean and they also provide two televisions as a form of entertainment on either ends of the restaurant. Food wise, it isn't the best Korean food I ever had but it is good enough to come back multiple times.  I normally order the $13.99 combo where you have an option of picking two dishes plus a drink. My go to picks usually involve a form of ramen + chicken katsu. The portion is huge so I normally have leftovers to take home.  The pork bone soup is also a good option you can never be disappointed with. It comes with 3-4 large pieces of pork and some potatoes. It is very flavourful and has the perfect amount of spice. The japchae is another highlight that I would recommend as it is served on a hot plate with a generous amount of glass noodles, rice, veggies, bulgogi, and an egg. It is a good option to pick if you do not like spicy food.  The service has been a hit or a miss in the past but the last few times I went had improved immensely. The staff have definitely made more of an effort in being attentive and providing better quality service since they opened this location and that is something I appreciate.  Overall, it is a standard restaurant that warrants a repeated visit for a simple dining."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far. The first time I was impressed by how much food we got for our money. The food itself was decent (we got jajangmyeon and kimbap) and I would have given the whole experience three stars. What made me start this review was yesterday's experience. Service has been great both times I've gone - friendly even at 9pm. They give you nine (!!) side dishes and you can have three things refilled (or I guess one thing three times). Still great value for the amount of food you get. Portions are big for decent prices, and huge if you get something from the family or dine for two section. They also have combos with pop which are a good deal as well.  But your experience with the food depends on what you get. I ordered a japchae rice, pretty standard at Korean restaurants. It came with a fried egg, and a salad? on the rice... to make up for the lack of vegetables perhaps. I'm not sure, but it was a bit of an oddity.  The japchae was dry and starchy and seemed undercooked - not like the slippery and springy feeling you're supposed to get. One of the side dishes is japchae and it was the same, but I didn't have the same standards for it. It seemed like they just took the side dish and put it on top of the rice - the temperature, texture, and taste were the same. The beef was incredibly dry, the driest I've ever had. It was also not sweet like you would usually get - rather it was kind of sour (vinegar? rice wine?) and gingery (you could see the tiny slivers of it in the beef). And even then there was no flavor. I didn't eat more than a few bites. Oddly enough, I also found a piece of chicken.  The kimbap we ordered was fine, but I think it would be a bit difficult to mess up cold vegetables and beef rolled up in rice. Again, the beef here was really dry but I feel this is slightly more acceptable in kimbap.   I'd probably come back here because it's okay food for a decent price, but it's hit or miss, depending on what you get. Don't get the japchae rice."}
{"text":"We had originally decided to go to Pho 88 but we ended up trying this Korean place next door ... and we were pleasantly surprised!  This is what we ordered for dinner : 40. Jajang Myeon  $7.99 Pop Combo : Tteok Bokki + Don Kasu P12  $10.99  The banchan (free small side dishes) had a lot of variety, the tteok bokki was nice, don kasu was alright but not light and crispy as I would have preferred, it also didn't have much meat in it.  The jajang myeon was wonderful also and the noodles were perfect.  I didn't get to try my usual beef bone soup and kalbi beef, but will try it next time!  I just noticed the sign says it's open till midnight?  Will try again next time I'm looking for a late night snack!"}
{"text":"I was avoiding this place for a while now due to the below average rating but when its minus ten degrees celsius outside I really crave pork bone soup.   Nine sides which made me happy but none really stood out as being great. I would prefer getting a really tasty side dish that is done well and have less side dishes.  The pork bone soup for $9.99 was pretty good. There was so much meat in my pork bones that I had enough left over to make a pulled pork sandwich. The only disappointment was that because there was so much meat I did not get enough soup, but I will take a higher meat to soup ratio any day of the week.   Also tried a beef kimbap for $6.99. This also tasted pretty good. No complaints here.  I find the prices reasonable here but a bit high when compared to other Korean restaurants. Service was nice and quick."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this place and found out that they have grilled meat. Went with the all pork option which is $20. The service here is so bad...it took forever before we were brought the menu. I also had to raise my hand several times- it's like the server doesn't even see me. I also had to remind her to bring our side dishes because when we asked her to bring more kimchi she left with our bowl and forgot. Then when we asked her again, she acted as if nothing happened. Meat was decent, they all taste the same- more on the sweet side. Nothing special here and the service was really frustrating."}
{"text":"My review is based on take out. I called to order a jajeonmyeon to take out at around 6:00. I told them I'll come in 10-15 minutes and right when I got there it was freshly made. The restaurant was quite empty when I went inside.  However food was quick, fresh and price was reasonable. The noodles and sauce came separately which was a nice gesture. Also came with a small container of kimchi and potatoes.   The total came to $10.16 which is okay I guess. Would come back for take out again."}
{"text":"2.5/5  My friends call this place \"Fake Joons\", mainly because they serve a more \"run-down\" version of Dak Gal Bee. Aside from the fact this place is much closer to home than Willowdale, I don't see myself coming here much after my experience here, and would rather go to the \"real\" Joons.  Service was poor from the start, as nobody came to us until 15 minutes later to take our order, even though two waitresses said they would take our order after they drop off the tea to another table. Of course, neither did.  We eventually got our order and were served with appetizers rather fast. They have a lot of options, such as carrots, kimchi, japchae, etc. The kimchi and carrots were okay, but the japchae was lukewarm. Normally in other Korean restaurants japchae has this smooth, silky taste but this one was too rough and sticky. My dad's theory was that it was probably either not authentic Korean or not fresh.  The Dak Gal Bee here was okay compared to Joons, however they use Kraft cheese slices instead of shredded cheese...I personally would take shredded cheese anyday. They also use this thin spaghetti like pasta instead of instant noodles. I was indifferent towards either at the end.  We also ordered a seafood soontofu, which was way too MSG filled for my liking. I had to consistently drink their free cold water every time I had a portion of the soup in order to get the MSG-ness off my tongue.  In terms of price this place is much cheaper than Joons and serves higher quantity of food, however in terms of quality don't expect much from this place, food or service."}
{"text":"the 2 stars is strictly for the service, ambience, kimbap...and location (because its in the middle of starbucks and popeyes...) Lets just say this place ain't korean at all lol. i don't know what to say... i was speechless.   FOOD: Appetizers: the glass noodle was like chinese noodle stir-fry. It's so obvious it wasn't authentic because all i taste was soy sauce.  Im pretty sure the kimchi is also from the super-market... if not... its worst then super market quality.  The potatoes.... tasted like MCDONALD'S french fries... thats how you know how old the potatoes or the oil is that they fried it in... sauce also wasn't very convincing that it was a sauce...  Don't get me started on the fish cakes... as soon as i put it in my mouth, felt like i got hit with 10 hours of second-hand smoking. It was really smokey and felt like it was burned. Which i don't understand WHY... because its a cold dish... Not even going to mention the other side dishes. it makes me upset they couldn't get the basic of the basics right.  Spicy Rice cakes: the texture was really good but the sauce they used was very powdery and dried up quickly... it made it feel like i was eating chalk and that i was going to choke on it... probably one of the worst rice cake dishes I've eaten...  Beef Kimbap:  The kimbap is probably one of the reasons why i didn't give it a one star... The texture is softer then the authentic korean kimbap which probably isn't ideal for everyone. BUT i've also preferred softer rice so i guess this part is a little biased but i can't help my preference to rice lol. But the seaweed they used was probably the wrong type of seaweed because it was really hard to bite it since it didn't tear. it was kinda soggy.   But my friend did say the Gabi was passable so if you still wanna try this place, order that..."}
{"text":"Thought I give this place a try since I always pass by it to either goto yogi or pho 88 and boy it was a mistake coming here....when we got there there around 6pm there was only 2 ppl in the entire restaurant and looking beside pho 88, it was packed....me and my gal were craving krn so what the hell, let's give it a try and boy did we make the biggest mistake....first of all I don't know if this is actually an authentic krn place because the waiter spoke to us in mandarin...2nd I was craving for kimchi fried rice and they only had fried rice that look like yang chow fried rice.....finally when we got the side dishes, there is usually a black bean side dish with some sweet kind of like teriyaki sauce on it, it was peanuts instead of beans.......now with the food I got the pork galbi which was special price for 10.99....portions were big and it tasted alright but OMG it did not come out right if you know what I mean....within an hour I got the shittites and will nvr ever come back to this place again!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Korean restaurant I have ever been to (in my opinion). There Gam Ja Tang is super good, I go with the less spicy version. I usually get the combo too, where I can choose one dish from A and one side from B for only $15. It's a very quiet place usually empty during weekdays but busy on the weekends and evenings. I know this might not be related to the food but their washroom is SUPER SMALL. The door can barely open properly. Other than that the servers are nice but it's kinda slow when there's a lot of people."}
{"text":"2.5  A Korean restaurant nestled in a Chinese plaza.  Not horrible, but nothing amazing either.  Pros: Large amount of seating Every item on menu comes with a picture  Cons: Average, average, average  We were felling Korean and after passing by this place so many times we decided to give it a try.  Walking in, you notice that this place is much bigger than it seems from the outside.  There are a lot of seats here.    Opening the menu it's refreshing to see that the menu has pics for every single item they have.  Korean restaurants almost always just use phonetics in English.  It's always written Gamjatang and not spicy pork bone soup.  If you're not familiar with Korean food most of the time it's guess work for you to determine what you're actually ordering.  We ordered the beef ribs, gamjatang and chicken ramen for our little one.  Here's how they staked up:  Beef ribs:  I use the steamed beef ribs at Song Cooks as my baseline.  The ribs here were definitely not as tender.  Imagine trying to eat not so tender meat with just chopsticks, not easy at all.  It was a struggle throughout the meal.  The taste was OK, a caramelized onion type of taste.  Gamjatang:  The bones were half tender, could of been more if you ask me.  The broth was right in the middle between rich and thin.  It wasn't bad, but nothing special could be said as well.  Chicken Ramen:  This one was the most disappointing to me.  It was like eating instant noodles.  My GF thought it was a bit better, but not by much.    This place just didn't do anything for me.  The food wasn't bad, but like I said, it wasn't great either.  It's the only Korean place in the area so it's got that going for it."}
{"text":"Not sure what they did to get such a low avg rating. One of the few legit Korean restaurants in the area, and its never filled to capacity. The odd time they do a crappy job, but overall I find their food on par with anything in Korea town."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Highlights are the long opening hours, great food, and convenient location. Korean food can be hard to find in the Bamburgh area without a drive towards Midland or Yonge. This place delivers. I've eaten cold noodles as well as tofu soups here and have been satisfied both times.   I can't make any direct comparison of the soups with other places - I don't typically order soup - but it was as expected. However, the cold noodles were SO good. The perfect summertime food!  The 9$ option came in beef broth with Asian pears and was very refreshing. The 12$ spicy sauce alternative was more of a mixed noodle (IE not in soup), but was a much larger portion that was well flavoured. Noodles from both bowls had that great bouncy texture you would expect from clear buckwheat noodles.   The service was a bit lacking on a crowded day, but the effort was evident so I wouldn't ding them for it. Maybe an employee didn't show up for work? I try to keep an open mind."}
{"text":"Lowering star cause the second time I came the food was disappointing and dry, service was still good though!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for their pork bone soup for years and it is one of their best dishes. The pork galbi for 2 for 14.99 is not bad either. They always give plenty (6-8) free side dishes even if you come before closing. Not to mention they close at 1:30 am! Food always comes out about same and piping hot but food quality is pretty average food, nothing that wows me, and the fact that they raised their prices recently, I find it a bit expensive for what you get. Will only come here once in a while if I'm really craving Korean."}
{"text":"Like all restaurants, every place has their specialties.  There is no doubt that this place is good for the more traditional-style Korean dishes.  Had the hwae-mool sundubu chigae and a grilled mackerel combo. The mackerel was truly grilled, not floating in oil and was absolutely exquisite.  The chigae had a rich broth and the tofu was very fresh.  Not overly generous with the seafood, but the broth, tofu and seafood was tasty with tons of garlic and gochu.  Mmmmm.  Panchan fresh but lacklustre.  I wish they'd make godengo jjorim - steamed mackerel in a rich gochuchang paste ... *hint hint*"}
{"text":"Have been here before - stick to the traditional ttukbegae dishes.  The dwen-jang chigae was VERY GOOD, morsels of seafood in there and fresh, silken tofu.  Just the right amount of gochu-garu.  Grilled mackerel was good, albeit borderline overcooked, but crispy and not drenched in oil.  Spouse's kimchi-chigae was very enjoyable.  Panchan was luckluctre except that they had mukenji kimchi which was delectable (we had a double order).  Kamja-tang is very popular here."}
{"text":"We (my boyfriend and I) came to Jeon Ju Hyang on a Sunday afternoon, it wasn't busy at all, I believe only two tables were taken up.   I placed an order of the seafood soon tofu (normally i swear by two restaurants, which in my opinion, make the best soon tofu, but that day I decided to try it at this restaurant) combo, which also comes with a fried mackerel fish on the side.  My boyfriend got the chicken jap chae noodles.   Before they served us our actual meals, we were given some appetizers. There was quite an assortment - potatoes, kimchi, bean sprouts, seaweed salad, glass noodles, and a mixture of fish cake and carrots. You can also get refills, however on only 3 appetizers.   Our meals came shortly after, my boyfriend got his first. Naturally, I stole some of his to taste. The noodles, salad and rice combination was quite interesting as I wasn't used to it. But taste-wise it was quite good.   My seafood soon tofu came, I inhaled a bit of the smell and was really excited to try it. It also came with a small bowl of white rice, I was hoping for purple rice. Bummer. I mixed it a little, and discovered some octopus pieces, one mussel, a lot of tofu and two small shrimps. I took my first bite of the soon tofu with a spoonful of rice, and was surprised with a lot of garlic! The broth was really good and tasty but a bit too garlicky.   My boyfriend finished his meal before I did (typical) and the mackerel fish still hadn't arrived yet. I signalled the waitress and she told us it would be ready in 3 mins. By then I was nearly done my broth of the soon tofu but still had a lot of the tofu leftover. I was about to go in for my last spoonful of rice when the waitress took away the bowl of rice from me!!!! How rude!!!! Why the rush too ?!? It's not like there was a line up outside of the restaurant of people waiting to get seated. Ugh.  I quickly said, excuse me I am not done with that. She handed it back to me without saying anything. An apology would have been nice.  And finally. The fish came. It arrived at our table sizzling hot. My boyfriend and I enjoyed it. However, be careful. They did not debone it.   Overall, I wouldn't say it's the best Korean food I had and the service wasn't all that great either. But it did satisfy my craving for Korean food."}
{"text":"they have so many choices on their menu, barbeque and some regular dishes. I am a big fan of bibimbap and im happy to find out they have glass noodle bibimbap(on sale, only7.99), i can always finish one bibimbap by myself, but this time i only finished the top layer of chicken, vege and glass noodle, they put toooooo much stuff!  my boyfriend had the pork bone ramen, which is very delish  we also had the garlic fried chicken, but after the ramen and bibimbap, we only ate 2 pieces.  the place is big, the location is nice, surrounded by go4tea and 0109. But we are too full to eat more."}
{"text":"We were served 8 side dishes to start- only allowed to refill three of them which was a bit cheap in my opinion but pretty good taste and variety. We got the spicy fried chicken which was surprisingly good for a not korean fried chicken place - crispy but not very spicy at all. The seafood pancake was a nice surprise since it had lots of seafood and was actually really yummy! We also got the jajangmyeon which came with beef and was quite flavourful. Portion sizes are really big!"}
{"text":"I guess this would be out go to for quick eats for Korean food. I wouldn't say it's the best and I wouldn't say it would be the worse. It is pricey for the quality of the food.  The customer service is what you would expect. You order, eat, pay and go.   I like how they give you a variety of side dishes (banchan) in the beginning, but don't be surprised if they don't taste like anything. We really do love the pork bone soup, and it's probably the only thing we consistency. They aren't hesitant in the meat either. The bulgogi is OK, in my opinion not worth $13.99.   I guess two stars for quick eat and the pork bone soup."}
{"text":"I'm here on a regular basis. Amazing service. Great food and fair prices. When you come regular enough they always throw in little bonuses to your meal.   Just waiting on their llbo!!  And their fried chicken will taste so much better. On top of that. They just got the sports packages and I come here to watch the raps too."}
{"text":"I picked a sweet soup with a beef combo,  It came with white rice and side dishes.  The soup was not very sweet and the beef was kind of \"old\".  The dish looked so good with a Japanese mushroom on top.  The seats of this restaurant were very comfortable but their AC was not ramped up enough, so if you order something hot or spicy, be prepared to sweat throughout the meal !"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend coming to this restaurant if you are looking for authentic Korean food.   The taste was really off.  My bibimbap had an overwhelming amount of sesame oil in it while my friend's jajangmyeon was just simply, awful. The noodles were way over cooked, the sauce was not very tasty and the meat was not the best quality."}
{"text":"Good food however it took too long for our dishes to arrive. Our dishes were not that complicated either - bibimbap and soon tofu.  Also, when we asked for refill of banchan, we were restricted to 3 choices only - unlike other Korean restaurants that usually just replace everything for you (especially when your order takes a while).  Place is spacious and clean. Great for big groups. Would come back with my family to give the BBQ a try as this seems to be a popular option."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with 5 of my coworkers and wanted to try something new. Not much selection of Korean restaurants in Scarborough and this restaurant ended up really surprising us. The food was decent. We shared a bunch of different dishes which for the most part we enjoyed it. Had the a sine dishes we tried were: Manuel ganjang chicken which was really delicious. Chicken kasu was nice and crispy. The pork bone soup was very tasty. The broth was very flavourful but meat was a little difficult to eat because it was mostly on the bone. We were disappointed with the bimimbap (we got both rice and noodle type) even though it came on a stone pot, it did not turn crispy. The meal also comes with an assortment of side dishes which were also good. More than enough food for 6 of us and the price was fair."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch it's not the best Korean food or the worst. They give you lots of side dishes which is good, but most of them taste bland. Service was good unless you come during the lunch or dinner rush. They can speak Mandarin, Cantonese and also English. Great for people who live around the area and also a great lunch can spot for high school students. Affordable prices.  I  got the pop combo: Tteok Bokki + ramen 10.99 and my mom got the kimchi spicy tofu soup."}
{"text":"Food: 2 stars The second star really is for the abundance in side dishes (banchan). None of the side dishes were outstanding but it's nice to have a variety. My boyfriend ordered the jab chae rice. It was a little on the sweet side but it was a good portion and it was alright (at least he didn't complain about it). My mom ordered the beef ramen and there were literally 2 small shriveled up pieces of beef. I'm surprised they actually served that to our table! We kindly asked for more beef to be served on the side. I got the gamja tang ramen and I was super excited for it too because that's two of my favourite things together! Why didn't more Korean restaurants think of this?! Or maybe I just haven't been to the right ones. Higher the hopes, the greater the disappointment. Firstly, not much meat on my pork bones and they weren't tender at all. I have read in other reviews that there was a lot of meat so maybe opt for the gamja tang without ramen? Most disappointing was the lean meat. Healthier option, but I wouldn't be out eating gamja tang ramen if I was looking to improve my diet.   Ambiance: 3 stars Clean and brightly lit. Don't remember seeing any booths. Simple decor.  Service: 2.5 stars SMILE, PEOPLE! I don't know if it's just that waitresses have terrible days or most of them hate their jobs at Asian restaurants. You don't have to be outright nice and polite but a small smile makes a difference. All I can say is, service wasn't bad and our waitress did what she needed to do."}
{"text":"I came with a group of friends because this was the second location and we wanted to see if this was good as the Warden and Steeles location. We ordered the Yang Nyeom Chicken (deep fried chicken with chilli sauce) and Dak Galbi (stir fried chicken with rice cake)  The deep fried chicken was really good because it wasn't too spicy. Most of the chicken was the drums which had a lot of meat. It was saucy but just the right amount. The Dak Galbi was okay, not the greatest because there was only a few pieces of rice cakes. We were kind of disappointment that there wasn't more rice cakes in the dish. Only positive was that there was a lot of chicken (for the meat lovers)  Overall, the food was tasty could be better.  3/5"}
{"text":"This place deserves the 2.5 overall score As a yelper, I now have a very picky palette. I can recognize good restaurants, and I can automatically point out mediocre restaurants.  I was first wowed by the 10 side dishes they provided...  Until I tasted it.  It was overall bland and tasteless.  I mean, tasteless kim chi? If you can screw up kimchi , theres no hope for you. Being spoiled by Chowon Family restaurant in Yonge and Cummer, I now have a raised bar when it comes to pork bone soup. The pork bone soup we got was watered down. It's very mediocre.  Good if you're not a yelper. I mean, this is probably the only Korean restaurant within the neighbourhood, so maybe they could rely their business solely on the community.. But me, I travel all the way to Brampton for fish and chip, so I wouldn't even come back here even if this restaurant was downstairs from my condo. If you don't want to travel very far and staying within the Bamburgh neighbourhood, I would suggest Seoul Garden outside of Market Village on Steeles and Kennedy Road"}
{"text":"I never intended to go to Jeon Ju Hyang Korean Restaurant! I was supposed to be going next door to have a bowl of Pho at Pho 88. I felt sorry when I walked by and this place is empty and they seems to be just coming up since their Grand Opening Specials won't be starting till April 15!   This place though has all the Chinese character/posters at the front door, it is runned by Korean. At least the 2 wait staffs are Korean speaking.   The prices seems reasonable.. the pork bone soup/spicy seafood noodles/traditional Korean noodle with chicken or beef all priced at $6.95.   However they don't have any soup noodle or any form of noodles today! I was disappointed... so I ended up ordering the Bibimbop ($9.95).   The appetizers were all quite good.. with 7 of them (kimchi, peanuts, bean sprouts, potatoes etc.) The bibimbop has a good mixture of fresh vegetables inside (carrots, mushroom, bean sprouts, cumcumbers) ... But I do feel really healthy eating that! The vegetables soup though has a lot of veg inside but I found it a little too salty for my taste.   The services of course is good.. since really I am the only one eating there for lunch!   They should have some lunch specials so more customers will come in!   However, I will be back to try out their Grand Opening specials Pork Galbi for $8.99 next week!   They don't accept credit card, interac and cash only."}
{"text":"Jeon Ju Hyang is quite promising. Love the extensive menu! Everyone should able to find something they like, hopefully!  We ordered:  Samgyetang ($13.99) highly not recommended. I was trying to convince my dinner mate not to order that but he insisted. Of course there was not any taste of ginseng, half a small chicken... a sad soup.  Jjam Bbong ($10.99 on Special for $8.79) was decent. Noodle cooked with a little bite and extra spicy usually do the trick!   Not a bad option if you have craving for Korean food. Plenty of parking as the lot here is huge! After hours when Rona is closed there are hardly any cars parked at this end!"}
{"text":"Love their pork bone soup and JAJANG MYEON. Fried chicken is a bit dry but taste ok. Side dishes are good!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant since it had such a variety of korean food but it was mediocre, there are better korean food elsewhere. Save your money and try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here because it was close by and open late. I didn't have high expectations before I ordered my meal. But this place was surprisingly good. The waiter took our order and brought over a bunch of side dishes.  Soon after. Maybe I shouldn't have ate so much of that since I ordered the gamjatang (pork bone soup) and the portion was quite big since each bone had a lot of tender fall off the bone meat on it. This is one of my new favourite spots for the gamjatang. For the price of $9.99 and it comes with a bunch of side dishes and tea, I think this was so worth it. I would definitely be back just for the gamjatang. I also wanted to mention that our server was really polite and the service was quick."}
{"text":"I really wish Yelp had half stars, because this restaurant stands at a solid 3.5 stars. I don't think there's anything special enough about it to warrant four stars, but it's not so average that it's a three.  There is a good amount of dishes available on the menu at reasonable prices too. I came here with two friends and we split the japchae bowl and two snacks + a pop (we chose ddeokbokki and beef skewers), and the garlic fried chicken. While nothing wowed me too much, I have to say that every dish was pretty well made and worth the money I paid for. We wanted the sweet rice drink but was told it was unavailable at the time, which was disappointing but not so horrible that it reflects negatively on the restaurant.   Service was okay. The waitresses were friendly and visited us pretty often while we were looking at the menu, but we had to ask them twice to bring us hot sauce.   I wish that I wanted to rate this place higher, because I think it has good potential and decent food. I can definitely see myself returning in the future if it were not situated in an awkward location. I only came today to try out a new place, but there isn't much else in the area (unless you want to visit Rona). I hope that something changes in the future that really makes this place pop."}
{"text":"A new korean restaurant opened up at Midland and Mcnicoll area. Found out its the same restaurant as the one in the bamburgh plaza.  They have this 11.99$ combo which is pretty good, as you get to select 2 items comes with a pop and sides. Great for 2 or 1 very hungry individual.  I ended up ordering the beef bimimbap + house made ramen and beef. Both dishes were delightful. The beef bimbimbap tasted better when you add kimchi to it, the beef ramen noodle was perfect for a cold night and it had a great broth which wasnt salty, for 11.99$ cant go wrong.  Definitely a great place to come by yourself or with company!"}
{"text":"I do come to this place more often recently ever since my friend P showed me a dish they call tofu at another restaurant.   This restaurant just happens to be very close to my place, close enough to walk.  That's why I come here often.   They are nice in that they can make their dishes with zero spice when asked.  So today I order something slightly different than my usual fare of Seafood Tofu, instead I got the Beef/Vegetable/Seafood tofu.  As expected I did take an MSG hit when I got back home, but I also found that this dish was saltier than my normal expectation.  I would still come back here again, but it would be just a flip of the coin between this and Pho 88 because of their MSG levels."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is rated so low. As someone who frequently eats Korean food, I think it deserves more like a 3.5/5 rating.   Their food is not bad at all and they give a larger variety of side dishes than most Korean restaurants.  I don't remember everything I've tried here but these are a few I recall:  - jampong (spicy seafood noodles): 4/5. One of the better ones I've had. I would recommend.  - jajangmyun (noodles in black bean sauce): 3.5/5. Just average but definitely not bad if you have a craving for it.  - pork/chicken cutlet: 3.5/5. Average. A good deal if you get the combo specials. - ddukbokki (spicy rice cake): 3/5. I always love spicy rice cake so I don't mind getting it here but it is not as good as other places. - chicken fried udon: 3.5/5. Good portion, I enjoyed it."}
