Zhen Choo is a typical suburban shopping center Chinese restaurant.  There's no real surprises here--you'll know exactly what you're going to get when you come in here.  And I mean that in a very good way.  Places like these serve good, solid Americanized Chinese food.  Translation:  what they do, they do well.

I stopped in here recently after doing a home visit for work.  Zhen Choo has the typical Monday-Friday lunch menu, with pretty much everything in the $5.00 per item range.  My General Tso's Chicken and my hot & sour soup was as good as any I've had.  Zhen Choo may not wow you, but it's got good food that'll give you good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"We live in the area and have ordered from Zhen Choo for years. It is not our only Chinese restaurant so I can't say, we take out often. It can be a hit or miss at times, but have not been overly disappointed yet. It is definitely a local Chinese takeout spot, it is not a restaurant, very few tables and it's not a pleasure to eat there. I like the Chicken & Broccoli/ w Steamed Rice.  The Pepper Steak is good as well. I don't care for the Egg Rolls. The Fried Rice is very good. It is a nice for take-out Chinese. The staff is very friendly, and food is prepared quickly and hot. I would recommend if your looking for a quick take-out."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for about a year now and haven't been disappointed yet. It's a no-frills, local Chinese food takeout spot. You can eat in, too, but it's easier to pig out at home :) We have tried a few different things; pepper steak, beef and broccoli, chicken fried rice, dumplings, pork lo mein, and general tso's. All have been very good! The woman running this place is very friendly and she gets the orders ready fast. Definitely recommend if you're near Braddock Hills!"}
{"text":"I find myself missing the Kung Pao Chicken, Mu Shu Pork, Lo Mein, and friendly service that this place offers. After living in Southern California for many years,and travelling to Hunan Province, I have tasted some of the best. This place is consistently good,and inexpensive.  Too bad it is so far from home now!  I don't get to visit Zhen Choo very often, and I miss it."}
{"text":"Best hot n sour soup I've been able to find in the Pittsburgh area. Great tasting food. Only thing that kinda sucks is they only take cash no debit cards."}
{"text":"We were looking for a go to Chinese Restaurant in the area and this is the one we decided on keeping. First off, the staff was very friendly and the food came quickly. We have been here multiple times and every time the food was good. It may not be the very best Chinese we've had, but it is consistently good. Hence, why we often return, stress on \"often\".

One thing if you go, remember they only accept cash."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time! We have been looking for a fast food Chinese place near our area for years, and excited to find one we like. The staff is extremely friendly. The food is decent and we haven't been disappointed. I requested no msg in our food and the owner was kind enough to not only explain what they use but even show us the seasoning they use we I could read the ingredient for myself."}
