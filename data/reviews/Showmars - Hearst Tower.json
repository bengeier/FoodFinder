{"text":"Best location in Charlotte! The food is always good, and the staff is great.. Especially the one cashier that is always so sweet and calls everybody \"baby\". I don't know her name, but she deserves a raise! Her personality is like no other!!"}
{"text":"I travel on business and eat here every-time I'm in town as it's never a disappointment.  I had a fried fish sandwich with fries, super hot and fresh.  Superior customer service.  Way to go!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is extremely pleasant!!  Food is as expected - plus fast service.  Great prices too."}
{"text":"Lunch winner. Consistently great service, usually accompanied by total sweetness or a good laugh.  Reasonable prices. The homemade TOMATO SOUP on Tuesdays and Fridays is thick and chunky and creamy and amazing.    GREEK VEGGIE PITA is fresh and relatively healthy, and comes with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, pepperoncinis, olives, feta and pita sauce (tzaziki) on a grilled buttery pita. Salads are also a good size and filling.   You can't go wrong here. Everything is tasty. The dining area was recently remodeled and is a nice place to eat."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast. I ordered liver mush Sammy since I love liver ( hubby was kringing)!! He ordered Greek salad. They were able to grill gyro meat on grill for breakfast for him. Nice lady's. Omg deep fried goodness liver mush. My first time was fantastic. Mmmm mmm. I did get egg but found out later I could have added cheese. But it was good anyway.."}
{"text":"The food here is always good & prepared fresh. And, it's always fast.   All of the Showmars locations recently went through a 're-branding' if you will, and the prices went up as a result. Some items significantly, while others are are few cents here & there. From talking to the staff in the Hearst Tower, they can tell that the crowds have decreased since the raised prices.   You would think that all locations would be about the same, but each manager gets to set store policy/menu. If you're interested in Showmars for lunch, I would avoid Hearst Tower and walk one block over to the Independence Tower location. At Hearst, their lunch specials only come with french fries. (Even though the menu online states \"plus any side\"). They up-charge you to substitute anything else ... and they charge for a damn little cup of ranch dressing. I HATE when you get charged for ranch. If you head across the street to the Independence location, you'll get the combo meals with ANY choice of side (with no up-charge) AND they give you free ranch.   As far as the food options go, everything I've had is good. The chicken salad pita and the Super C burger are my go-tos. The salads are huge ... and you can get it in a taco bowl shell if you want! They also have delicious & fresh brewed sweet tea!"}
{"text":"This is such a delicious place to eat hidden inside a building with a few more places to eat.  Soooo glad we are here and not at Subway it was the same price and just as fast if not faster and we were here at lunch time on Wednesday. I had the Gyro Basket my sons had a Single American burger and the other one had a burger on pita bread. They both ate every single bite and loved it. Mine was soooo good but I don't think I've ever had a bad Gyro anywhere. It was good portion sizes and we all left stuffed and ready to enjoy Discovery Place!"}
{"text":"Always a good burger (Carolina style) and the service is always fast. I walked in and placed my order quickly and decided to walk next door to pick up cupcakes for a meeting. By the time I got back my food was ready...that's what I call a quick lunch"}
{"text":"Fast food, but Showmars is local & sort of unique. For lunch my favorite is the all American pita burger and for breakfast eggs, bacon, hash browns & toast. It's not high end, but is consistently good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get a good breakfast specially in uptown. I come to this place often whenever I am in uptown. I have been coming here since 2007 and I will keep coming until I have any bad service or food experience. The other thing I noticed is that most of their staff is still the same which is a good sign.  Anyways, I get the same plater almost every time but some time I like to mix it up. This place is decent where they have enough seating area. I personally like the window seat towards college street. Lot of people prefer the booth and they have plenty to keep ppl happy. It is always clean and I see employee on the floor to make sure it's clean. If customer left items on the table, it don't take them to clean it up.   The lady at the counter is the manager (I think) and she is always there, I haven't seen a day where she was not there which tells me that she has it all under control LOL   I see variety of people here from beginner to executives and let's face it, regardless of the size of your ego or size of your wallet, YOU GOT TO EAT right!!!   :D"}
