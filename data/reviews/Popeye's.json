{"text":"The fried chicken and sides are pretty good, however the overall wait time subtracts from my star rating.  I've visited this location twice since it has opened and the wait time really isn't worth it.  My first visit resulted in about a 1.5 hour wait and the order was incorrect, so the final wait time was close to 2 hours.  My second visit on 08/19/12 was approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes.  During the second visit on a Sunday there was only one register open and nearly 100 people in line.  This is a good place to grab dinner after winding down a long shopping trip, but it's not somewhere that you can run to and pick up a quick bite.  Since Popeye's is considered fast food and not Gordon Ramsey's steak in Las Vegas, I have to give it a low rating, because \"who would wait over an hour in line at a McDonalds or Burger King?\".  I'll give the place 6-8 months for the hype to calm down and then I'll return and update my review."}
{"text":"Food here is decent and basically the same as Bojangles with some minor twists that are welcome when you get tired of the main chicken places around.   The main problems are the prices and service, being in the mall you expect some inflation but not 50% over the same place right down the road.  The service is also abysmal, they barely speak to you and leave things out like dips and napkins. Today the woman slid my box to me and just looked at me, I'm glad Popeyes is back in the area but if this how it's going to be I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"(concord mills mall) First one in NC!! is best to go thru the week before every1 gets off unless you will b n line"}
{"text":"I live close by, and I dine here once in a while. The overall experience is okay, but I would give 4 stars if I wasn't served with old fried chickens the other day for my take out order. You can wait for their fresh hot fried chickens, they're juicy from inside and crispy on the outside!"}
{"text":"Aside from the expected long lines and inflated prices in a mall, the service was horrible the staff was rude. When I got my order my chicken was NOT cooked properly, it was still gooey in the middle and my fries we cold and soggy. When my husband took it back, the manager told him it wasn't raw, and that he'd have to wait 20 minutes for new chicken tenders. She rudely gave our money back and walked away without an apology. Even in the mall, I still expect good customer service especially from a manager."}
{"text":"Man I've missed this place! My only wish is that they would put one of these joints on the other side of town....driving more than 30 minutes is ridiculous!   But did I do it....YEP!   The line was crazy long...I guess this is a regular thing because no one seemed phased. When we finally made it to the counter my friends and I ordered a family pack (16 pieces, 3 sides and 8 biscuits). We ordered the chicken spicy, two orders of mashed potatoes and cajun gravy (because it's just that delicious) and rice and beans.   Service was horrible. The Popeye's crew needs to get it together! Here's a tip guys...if you smile and say \"hello\" the customers might not be as angry when they wait 10-15 minutes for their food.  We waited...and waited along with all the other people for our number to be called. Finally it was our turn and since we knew we couldn't eat it all we asked for bags and you would have thought those things were laced in gold and diamonds. Geesh!   The saving grace is that the food was good. The chicken was crispy and juicy with just the right amount of spices. And that darn cajun gravy....Mmmm Mmmm! Just like I remember which makes me only want it more and more.   But I have to agree with other reviews, the wait time and crappy service makes this place for now just A-OK.   Let's hope they can get a better system figured out...soon!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this for so long. No more nasty Bojangles or KFC for me. I also think its funny how they were the ONLY restaurant with a long line, does that tell you anything......"}
{"text":"Waited 25 mins to get my first taste of the chicken today at Concord Mills.  Long wait, but the chicken was worth the wait.  Kids enjoyed the biscuits and the sweet tea was very good as well."}
{"text":"Long lines, inflated pricing, but what did expect in a mall, chicken, thankfully, was good  must try the new one on the west side of town, much closer..."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm greasy goodness  Food If you want to get your grease on, go here!  They have a lot of people going in and out of this location that they were running low on chicken when I came in.  So when I got my chicken, it was fresh out of the greaser........mmmmmmm oilllll and crispy goodness.  The size of the chicken pieces are really big too! I find they put more batter at this location for that extra crunch that we all enjoy.  TTC There is a bus stop right outside of the restaurant so you can wait inside and run out when you see the bus coming.  Location Well it's in the Moss Park area so you are bound to encounter some memorable characters."}
{"text":"The chicken of my childhood! Popeyes will always have a special place in my heart... Especially with those mashed potatoes and Cajun gravy.    Right now since its new and pretty novel the line is pretty long.  Hopefully people don't get turned off by the long wait, but I managed to beat the lunch crowd and get my popeyes fix.  So glad I don't have to drive all the way to exit 138 on 85 for Popeyes anymore.  It should get pretty interesting since I thought Boj had a firm grip in the area.  Word of warning.  Concord mills food court prices are pretty high to begin with... And the new Popeyes is no exception.  Almost like being in an airport."}
{"text":"**Note: This location is no longer a Popeye's... it is a knock off called Mother's Chicken and has the same menu, but is not at all the same!  Now I search for my new favourite location of Popeye's! **   I am a fan of Popeye's, when it comes to take out fried chicken they are the best.  Forget KFC or Church's, the Spicy Fried Chicken at Popeye's is delicious!  Crispy, crunchy crust with just the right amount of salt, seasoning and spice, and the chicken is moist and tasty having been marinated to maximize juiciness and taste.  For some reason, I get the best chicken at this location, the location on Yonge south of Dundas served me undercooked chicken, and the location at College and Spadina always takes too long.  Best side IMHO is the rice and beans.  I want to like the biscuits but they taste too much like margarine, I wish they were more like the biscuits at McDonalds... which are the best fast food biscuits I have found.  The fries are as bad as the other Fried Chicken places... what is it about fried chicken restaurants and lousy fries?"}
