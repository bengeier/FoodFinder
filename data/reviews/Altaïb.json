{"text":"This is my favorite place in Montreal to grab a cheap bite.  The zataar manakish is a standard for me.  This is not a place you go for a romantic meal, this is a place you go to for a taste explosion.  This place has gusto, all the food seems to be made from scratch and there is something endearing about a line of guys behind the counter all rushing around to prepare and cook for the line of people that always seem to be there.  I've never tried their pizza, but for some reason, all pizza in Montreal seems to conform to an idea that pizza should have thick, nasty crusts, be drowning in greasy cheese and not much else.  In any case, i think they only serve it because they can; but if you're in Al-Taib, you should be getting Lebanese specialties, not pizza.  It's one of the things I miss most since moving away from Montreal; but I'm glad to see they've been successful all these years."}
{"text":"I steadily ate here all throughout my university days (and I also steadily watched the place get more popular and the prices go up too!). It's got great food and a nice variety, especially vegetarian options. It's not secret why tons of Concordia students hit this place every day."}
{"text":"Al-Taib have four locations within a block of Concordia's downtown campus, and this is pound-for-pound the best on of the lot. Excellent, flavourful pies for next to nothing. Perfect for grabbing a bite to each during your class break."}
{"text":"This place is a specialized branch of the local Al-Taib Pizza / Lebanese food chain. And I do mean \"local\" - there are two other locations within two blocks!  The strange thing about this one is that it's not what sign claims it to be. No kebab, no wraps - just Pizza and a salad bar. The 24 hour sign must be for the chain as a whole because this place is definitely closed mornings and some afternoons. There isn't really a lot of variety compared to Double Pizza, either.  But all of that seems pretty moot, because the pizza is both consistently good and consistently cheap. Can't argue with that!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband had to do heads or tail because i wanted to try Al-Baghdadi up the street and he wanted to try this one, so since it was 1 AM, we decided we would try Al-Tabib first.  Entering the restaurant, theres is a salad bar, which i found quite nice, the restaurant also has an upstairs dinning room, which we found to be quite messy, not dirty, just like old food plates on about every table.  We took a while to decide what we wanted and the guy seemed quite annoyed about it(even tho there was no one else in line) so we finally got a cheese/zaatar manakish, he got a beef manakish because they din't have shawarma, and a normal slice of pepperoni pizza.  For the food i can say it was pretty good, the bread on the manakish was great, despite not my favourite mix of spices(i really wanted to try the zaatar) the food was good, my husband really liked it. 12$ for two manakish, a pizza and 2 water bottles is good."}
{"text":"Their pizzas are better than Dominos/Pizza hut if you get them to make them fresh for you. The mexican one is pretty good. They sell by the slice, too.  The minced meat pita wraps are good. Try the Za'atar ones with mint but skip the pickles and onions.  Their salad and rice bar aren't that good.  Seating is average. Open 24/7 which is a plus if you are in downtown.  Parking is challenging.  I'd say it's your best bet for good food late at night to satisfy those munchies."}
{"text":"Food is ok. But customer service is very poor. The staff is extremely unfriendly esp if you call to order."}
{"text":"Al-Taib is delicious and so freaking cheap! A student's dream come true... You can order a feast of some of the most tastiest and freshest food in Montreal for 5-10$. The falafel sandwich is very tasty complimented by a tahini sauce with the perfect consistency, fresh vegetables, and mint that you can have put on the sandwich for a couple of cents extra. Spicy meat and Lahameh bil Agine are also great lunch/dinner opitions, for breakfast try the Za'atar Manakish or the Cheese Manakish or better yet get a half-and-half. Oh yeah... they also serve up a mean pizza free of grease and always fresh.  The main outlet on Guy-Concordia is open late so definitely swing by here if you are looking to get something to eat after a late night partying or studying. You will not get better value for your dollar anywhere else in the city. If you are closer to McGill you can always swing by the Al-Taib express in the basement of Gert's open on weekdays from 10am-6pm."}
{"text":"I go here when I need food in like 1 minute flat.   They are very smart and efficient.  The pizza isn't really for me.  The rubber cheese is a bummer and I find I get hearburn from alot of their stuff.  The flatbreads all dressed are great value and filling and healthy so I eat those on the run.  Go to Al-Bagdadi if you have a bit more time and want to really enjoy a properly made flatbread  I like their salad bar but it is quite pricy  very nice staff"}
{"text":"Zatarr is the best here. Amazing how this place is open 24 hours. A perfect meal or snack at any time!"}
{"text":"Best place in Montreal to grab a cheap and delicious slice of pizza. Hands down! The line can be intense but it moves very quickly. Just be ready to give your order when your turn comes up!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to the other ones, but this little shop was great. I believed I googled 'cheap pizza' in Montreal, and found this on the list. Restaurant served great pizzas and arabic dishes. Tried the Laham Bagine by recommendation, and was amazed. All in all, two big slices of pizza, two pita-style dishes, and a coke equaled 9 dollars! Went for lunch, but supposed this place was a haven for drunks in the area."}
{"text":"All I have to say is dude. I got the poulet slice (chicken) pizza and it was pretty good and fresh. The bread it was made on was crisp and the chicken was cut as thin as to resemble ham and not overpower the cheese. I liked it so much, I ordered 2 lol."}
{"text":"This place has defined my drunk nights while I was in university. Their pizza is a wonderful thing.... even now when I return (not as drunk) I still enjoy some Al Taib. While not the best middle eastern food (I would recommend Boustan for that - just a block away) - but their pizza is unique. They got an express location as well that serves faster - this is more the sit-down place.  Excellent stuff!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Al-Taïb!!!!!!!! When i'm in Concordia territory i definitely stop by for a Zatar, an orange brio, and a falafel ball on the side. I can eat here inside of $10 and be totally set. Know what you want before you get to the counter... but the best bets so far are spinach pizza, chicken pizza, and of course the Zatar. This place is totally a student staple and i've definitely brought everyone i know to eat here, it's kind of a right of passage for the downtown crowd. The dining room's all right, but I used grab my meal to go and catch some rays in the Normand Bethune park but I guess that's now history.. in any case, there's always a couple of tables outside if you're willing to brave the bird shit. The tabouleh is great as well, very lemony. I refuse to go to their other locations because this one does it the best."}
{"text":"Cheap but rude at times. I experienced it twice. The food is varied and cheap and if you go within busy hours it is mostly fresh as well"}
{"text":"Had Lahm bi Ain the other day, was not impressed. It was below average, the 2 star for the cheap price. I would not go there again."}
{"text":"Love the pizza. My friends and I went here three times on our trip to Montreal - it became our favorite late night snack."}
{"text":"Over the years, Al-Taib has expanded beyond belief. Hitting every corner of the Concordia Quarter, they've done quite well for themselves! However, with their success, they have lost much quality in their output. Not only have prices risen dramatically due to popularity, but they don't seem to care very much about the quality of the service and food. I've lived in the area for about 23 years, and have seen and experienced the drastic changes take place.  The service comes off dull and there isn't much 'friendliness' in the factor; now sure, their job requirements don't include becoming buddy-buddy with customers, however, minimal effort to be friendly and accommodating would at least make the experience more enjoyable. They always seem to be talking amongst themselves and respond monotonously to the customer's order. On rare occasion though, you'll get a more 'focused' server.  As far as mana'eesh goes, I'd recommend: Feta, Zaatar, Cheese, half Zaatar/Cheese, or the Lahme B'ajine. Adding toppings will cost you extra, but a few of them are good, such as: Mint, Olives, Turnips, or Tomatoes. The food quality is not bad, it tastes good when fresh, but sometimes the dough can come out real thick, original toppings may be scarce, added toppings may not be the most fresh, and other times your pizza or mana'eesh will be dripping in oil...   Nowadays, I'd rather go elsewhere and get something better that costs less too."}
{"text":"Al Taib gets a solid 4-star rating for its manakish.  Most are pre-made and waiting in the refrigerator.  I had the cheese/zaatar and lahm bi' ajeen versions.  While the cheese/zaatar was certainly enjoyable, a more pronounced cheese/zaatar presence, along with a more generous application of olive oil would have made it truly excellent.  The crust is thin, crispy edges and tender center, and folds very nicely.  The lahm bi'ajeen is very good, not overly full of toppings, but not sparse.  I believe the oven is key to the bread's overall quality, as it is a high temperature stone oven.  Quite inexpensive, $4.50 for both.  A varied assortment of manakishes are offered, some traditional, some a little less so (kafta and shawarma toppings)"}
{"text":"decent service but the food is oily, greasy crap, don't recommend if you're not used to heavily oily foods.. personally ended up having stomach aches"}
{"text":"This is pretty much the only food I really miss in Montreal. Zaatar sandwiches, all the food @ Al Taib Grillades... all that is soooo good"}
{"text":"Man, what happened to this place? They used to have some of the best cheap pizza in town, but man, now it's just cheap. Dry, flavorless - the zatar was disappointing too. So sad this place has gone downhill."}
{"text":"Went for a quick bite, since I am in rush for Appointments. I heard about this spot from many friends. Since, it was on my way, I went in. It's small place; I see it's perfect place for students to pick up food and go. My sister and I ordered pizzas; my sister got a cheese slice and I got hot peppers with sausage slice. It was a generous slice for the price I paid. The pizza was perfect to the T. Service was very quick. I look forward to come back here again."}
{"text":"Salad bar is where it's at.  I stopped by on my way home and had to pick up olives and of course they had a bunch. I decided to pick up a few pickled turnips to because how could I not.  They have pizza ready to go a slice is about $2 something but it's not my fav but definitely not the worst I've ever had.  Smart that they're open 24/7 because who wants to go to McDonald's every time You have a craving? It's cheap it's close and it's right beside guy metro."}
{"text":"Funny little place, we enjoyed it, but it was hard to understand the menu and options. We got two slices of pizza, nice and I did a plate at the salad bar, by the pound.   Fresh cheap and nice, I would love to know what I should have ordered."}
{"text":"Great place - freshest and best falfel, and great alternative to the busier space. and heavier food of the better know Boustan"}
{"text":"Good food.  Authentically funny  people behind the counter.  Cheap."}
{"text":"Have heard nothing but good things about this place from my inlaws and finally was in the area to stop by and try their food. I thought it was decent, but nothing great. Being so close to the university, I can see how most students like it. Also, the guy that owns it needs to work on his customer service. He seemed like a jerk."}
{"text":"i would eat the pizza here every day.  It's weird how middle eastern and pizza places are merged together everywhere in Montreal.. nonetheless, fresh, tasty and cheap."}
{"text":"Every once in a while I stop here for a quick bite after 3am. Pizzas are good, check my picture. I usually take a Mexican and a toute garnie. I would only go for Pizzas, the buffet doesn't look appealing to me."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall serves up good, fast junk food! Lots of varieties of pizza, manakish (kind of Levant dough with thyme and diverse toppings), gyros, poutine... Very inexpensive, full of Concordia students who know a good thing when they see it! Enjoy with moderation! Namaste"}
{"text":"This place is located in a great location. We stopped here on our way back from Mont Royal. It isn't too far from the base and is located close to the universities.   It was a great price.   We had falafels. They were alright, but just alright. There were no pickled turnip and the falafels were a bit on the dry side.   It is alright if you are looking for something fast and cheap but if you are looking to enjoy your food I would pass."}
{"text":"Handy fast pizza. It is very good and large for he price. A jumbo pizza with 16$ and 3 drinks on top. It is amazing. My son loves their cheese pizza.   Their tomato sauce is amazing and well seasoned.  Recommended for low budget take out pizza."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and overtime, I noticed their service had been getting poorer and poorer. The food isn't as tasty and well quality as the first time I came here but if you're looking for a decent meal, I'd recommend others to give it a try."}
{"text":"I LOOOOVE this place! Their pizzas are good but seriously you have to try their pita wraps! Only $2.50 it's unbelievable how far your money goes here. I usually order their \"spicy meat pita\" or \"laham blajen\" (make sure they put mint leaves in it!!)  Sometimes they're \"out\" of mint which pisses me off.. they need to really stock up on that stuff!! Out of all the restaurants in Montreal, once my plane lands, I am here within 24 hours. No joke."}
{"text":"Such a convenient place near Concordia with great food options, quick service and food that actually tastes good. I've never been disappointed whether it's their pizzas or traditional middle eastern food!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in about 10 years, and I am so glad it still exists. What a gem! I always order the circular cheese pizza with all the toppings inside (all dressed). It's a steal at $6. What great value for the food. It's simply delicious take out. Been here forever and for good reason."}
{"text":"Went here on a really cold night and I was starving so decided to step in. It was about midnight and most of the pizzas looked good and fresh so I decided to get 2 slices, 1 chicken and one pepperoni. Both came out to $6.00 which is a little high but not the worst for the location. I found the chicken pizza slice was the better of the two but they both tasted really good and I would come back for it when I'm near the place"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Meat a little dry but everything else was in point. The owner made us feel like in Mama's kitchen. Big portions that will satisfy most. Quick service. Absolutely worth the price."}
{"text":"Al-Taib is fantastic.  With a menu in French and Arabic, it has to be good!  The pizza here is really good, and the service is quick as well.  This is key if you are out shopping and want a quick bite or are out late night and want a slice before going out to the bars.  The funniest pizza is the \"Mexicaine\", I never knew there was such a thing as a Mexican pizza.  I guess you learn new things in Montreal."}
{"text":"I use to come here so often during my student days at Concordia, however tonight it was below average! So disappointed with Altaib .. what happened to your quality of service & food I'm sobbing!!!   Ok so we came in after a party to grab something filling yet delicious. They use to be known for super fresh food during late night hours.  The Ambiance was kind of dull this time. Not too many people as I am use to seeing it.   The service was a disaster... there were 3 guys at the counter and they looked completely lost! They asked us 3 times our order of pizza and falafel lol how hard is it to remember an order of a slice of pizza & falafel sandwich JESUS!!  It was slow and I felt completely ignored. The guy was so rude and just wanted me out of there. I asked him for a plastic bag since we took it to go and didn't even look at me to say ok nothing he just took the bag in a slow motion way and handed to me in a weird condescending way...Wow :/ not cool!   I took a mixed plate from the buffet option and added a slice of pizza.  The food was super cold and not fresh as it use to be ! I ordered a pizza with extra olives .. i was appalled.. He gave me maybe like 5 littles olive slices .. super generous right? \"the beauty of irony \"   Overall, I was so disappointed and unhappy with my service and food quality .. don't think I want to come back here again unfortunately:/"}
{"text":"Look, I'm from New York and there has never been a Montreal slice that has impressed me, but I live in the the neighborhood and this is my go-to spot for a halal pepperoni slice after a night out of drinking (yep, I know, but we pick and choose our vices in my house).  Decent pizza at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Quick delicious cheap eats! All the pies were pre made, but you could tell they were made that same day, very fresh and the dough was well flavored with the right amount of chewiness. I would go back if I was in Montreal."}
{"text":"I been here a few times but last night was not there best night. The place was busy but they were short staff and running around.  The pizza was not warm and toppings were scarce on the pizza.  The falafel sandwich they forgot to put Int the. Beets and the sauce : The pita was stale:  Will go back again hoping that this was just a bad night"}
{"text":"Great halal good with a fantastique veggie selection.  There is a oven with take out pizza. I prefer the cold and warm buffet . the cold buffet has exotic salad section with different sauces.  I love zaatar. I recommend to get all dressed. I like the light feeling of after eating fresh food and this restaurant provides it.    There is WiFi available and big screen television upstairs. Best place for Concordia students to take a break from studying"}
