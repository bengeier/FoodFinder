{"text":"This is a fantastic place to grab some delicious breakfast food.  They have the best grilled cheese that I've ever had, the service is fantastic, and it's a great value!  I would highly recommend dropping in if you're on Roncy; I even prefer Era to Aris Place."}
{"text":"Took 30 minutes to get a second cup of coffee with two wait staff and only 5 tables occupied. Waitress had no clue what was on the menu. Food was served 45 minutes later but was incorrect. We didn't receive cutlery either. Food was okay when it arrived."}
{"text":"Great traditional breakfast diner. Excellent food and fantastic value. Service is awesome too!"}
