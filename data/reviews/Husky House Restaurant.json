{"text":"This place is a truck stop. You get truck stop food, truck stop prices, truck stop staff, truck stop environment. Nothing to complain about here."}

Sort of an odd choice of restaurant to stop off at, especially for two Asians and a white person. Small rural town, trucker restaurant, yeah I felt a little bit like a specimen! Anyway, my friend wanted to try a 'greasy spoons' restaurant, and what better place to try that then at a trucker stop?

Inside of the restaurant, looked like a typical scene from a movie. Rundown, but clean interior. Our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly (she was probably amazed at seeing Asian people pass by)! We ordered (shared by three grown adults) - the mixed breakfast (got bacon, eggs, ham, sausage, toast and home fries) and an iced tea (YUCK, too watered down and nasty).  

The home fries were absolutely delish, the toast had a bit too much butter for my liking (i now understand the concept of 'greasy spoons') and the eggs weren't the greatest.  

I'm not sure if I'm a greasy spoons type of gal, I think this type of food is good a stick to your ribs type of meal, and a don't eat until until dinner type of thing.  I'll just stick to Tim Hortons breakfast sandwiches and French Vanilla coffee thank you very much!"}
{"text":"We have been stopping here for quite a number of years, every couple of months. Until tonight, we have never been disappointed with our meal.  Tonight however, another story. Turkey club was missing the tomato and there was very little lettuce and the turkey was shaved, so it crumbled and fell out of the sandwich. Beef Dip was not exactly hot. Fries were burned. 
 I, not happy. The restaurant was not exactly the cleanest we have seen it."}
{"text":"It's not pretty but it's cheap and the food is good enough. The staff was very friendly and it's a good place to go with kids because they are not fussy when it comes to tantrums."}
