{"text":"This is a great place to stop every day for your morning coffee (I recommend the Palermo roast), as the staff is friendly and care about getting you out the door and on your way.  

I have been going to Sunrise Sunset nearly every day  for the past several years for my morning coffee on my commute from Etna to Oakland.  The staff really hustles to keep me going (which is nice, as I am typically running late).  They give you a free cup of coffee for every ten that you buy, and for a regular like me - they usually have my coffee in the cup before I even walk through the door.

For me, this place deserves 5 stars because of the high quality coffee and the excellent service.  I actually miss the place when I travel or when I have to get coffee from a Panera or Starbuck's."}
{"text":"The best coffee in the area (go for the Kenya AA). Super friendly staff. Very inviting atmosphere. Yummiest waffles and the muffins are really good. Prices are very reasonable  Only down side is that they close around 2pm, but for your morning coffee, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Absolutely the cleanest restroom in the area. The menu is limited coffee shop with a wide range of beverages. 

Food is limited to a few pastry items such as Danish, muffins, biscotti and a few hot items such as a Belgian waffle, breakfast sandwich. I find the pound cake looks better than it tastes. 

A great place to pick up a drink a rest a bit. Would have rated it 5 stars if there were more food choices.

My iPhone map locates this further along Seavey than it really is. It is located in a tiny strip mall not too far from Evergreen."}
