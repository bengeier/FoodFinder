{"text":"Was excited that there was a deep dish pizza place opening in Toronto. Unfortunately, it missed the mark. Crust is not very good, nothing like a traditional Chicago style. Topping are extremely salty, however sauce is not bad."}
{"text":"It only got one star because the pizza itself was okay, but I found the advertising misleading \"12 personal pizza\", but it was more like a slice, so it wasn't a lot of food for $12.    And not to get super preachy, but for a price and place like this, I thought the styrofoam/plastic container was unnecessary.  The \"tell Yelp to fuck themselves\" sign was also telling..."}
{"text":"Excellent Chicago-style! Anybody who complains about the wait in their review just doesn't get it. There's a reason this place is so busy--the pizza is incredible! They serve pizza and beer. That's it. And they do it perfectly."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and it's pretty damn good. The place is right by Gerrard Square and the streetcar and bus drop you off fairly close to it.  The pricing is pretty good, especially with their slice deal. $6 for a slice and pop or $10 for a slice and a pint. They have a blonde and a big wheel on tap. The place is pretty tiny so try not to bring more than 4 people.  First visit: Ended up here on a whim for dinner with a friend. Both bartender and waitress were really nice. Service was a bit slow but it was a dinner rush and had some pretry loud music going on. From what I could tell, it was only these two serving the whole place. We ended up sitting right at the bar. Prepare for a 30min wait because they make it as soon as you order. We ended up getting two personals. One classic and the other farmers market. It was good. We even ended up getting more sauce which made it that much better. The pepperoni was kinda limp and sad. I wish they would crisp it up a bit before putting it into the pie. Overall we were full and happy with our meal.  Second trip: Went with a group of four. We got there around 5:30 so it was fairly empty. But it got filled pretty quickly as we were eating. Decided to try their new pie. Green tree which had kale, brocolli, and red peppers. Three of us ordered slices while one ordered a personal. They waited to serve our slices to wait for the personal which I thought was nice. It was the same servers so they were still really nice. I felt this time around there was way more sauce. It also seemed more sour and watery. Extra sauce was definitely not requested this time. My slice also looked really burnt on the edges which was kinda disappointing. But honestly for 6 bucks I was super full and happy.  Overall, it's a great bang for your buck. I do wish they served some apps or something to help the time pass but oh well. The pizza is good if you want to try a deep dish. Come a little early or later than the rush so you dont have to worry about bumping into people. Definitely call ahead and order so you don't have to deal with the wait."}
{"text":"New pizza joint in the Gerrard St. East area!  Double D's offers Chicago style deep dish pizza - a nice change from your typical thin crust.   A cozy little place with friendly staff, a bar, some big screen TVs and deep dish pizza. What more can you ask for!?   We ordered a large Chicago classic (pepperoni and Italian sausage) to go. They told us it would be about a 25minute wait so we walked over to the nearby Gerrard Square to kill some time. Once we returned, it definitely got a lot busier. There were many in line for take out as well as seated for dine in.   Once we were handed the pizza box, the heft of this pie was obvious. This was not going to be your normal pizza. At first bite, the tomato sauce was a little on the sweet side. We had some unmelted cheese under that but was easily remedied with another pass through the toaster oven. Other than those minor issues, this was a decent deep dish pizza. We will definitely return!  *based on take-out experience*"}
{"text":"I don't have experience with deep dish pizza, but other reviewers seem to be suggesting this is not the Chicago real deal.   I ordered for delivery. It's all the ingredients of pizza, and somehow really just not any of the goodness and satisfaction of pizza : (  I rarely post negative reviews, but this was pretty disappointing. Ingredients seemed low quality and it was merely lukewarm on delivery. Maybe it was a bad day. I may try again..."}
{"text":"Best pizza of my life! I had the blue cheese pizza and added pineapple as an extra topping. It was amazing. The amount of blue cheese used was just right and the smokiness of bacon cut through the cheese really well. Will come back again and again. Totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Pizza is decent.  The place is ram packed and they aren't baking the pizza as long as they should do the cheese isn't melted all the way through.  Hopefully they get the quality on track as it has potential.  Would try it again."}
{"text":"Honestly wouldn't recommend. I'd perhaps give them another try, but the pizza dough wasn't cooked through when we got to our second pieces. The fresh basil (1.25$) was the saving grace. For 24+ for a small pizza I just wanted it to be cooked. I also didn't enjoy the extremely sweet tomato sauce."}
{"text":"Ordered a (take out) Chicago Classic and enjoyed it. A large costed $38 but is enough to feed 4 average eaters. I will go again!"}
{"text":"Service was fine, pizza was very disappointing. Mostly cheese and sauce, crust was burnt and barely any vegetables or meat inside. Not worth the ridiculous amount they charge for that not even mediocre deep dish pizza"}
{"text":"My family and I were super pumped to try this spot on our weekly family night.  Two mediums (farmers market and blue cheese) and no sauce. So after giving the shop a call, they said sorry and that was it."}
{"text":"Came with low expectations as I am a fan of the napoletana pizza but was pleasantly surprised.  I order large farmers market pizza (vegetarian) and was very rich with cheese tomato sauce and vegetables, crust was not too thick and we really enjoyed it.  Only problem was that for extra fresh  basil we had to pay $4 which is a bit too much for basil..   We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I ordered a large pizza a few weeks ago and it was extremely disappointing. I wish I had taken a picture of it. I had ordered from Double D's once before and it was fantastic (which is why I'm giving it two stars instead of one). This time, however, the crust \"bowl\" was less than half full of toppings and looked absolutely ridiculous. The crust, without any pizza toppings to keep it moist, was completely dried out and inedible. It could only be considered Chicago-style in terms of the order the toppings were added, but this was not even close to deep dish. I've actually had thicker pies from Pizza Pizza! It would appear that the honeymoon period is over and Double D's has decided to drastically cut back on toppings to make more profit. #deepdishfail"}
{"text":"Just a heads up, you got to be early or just have sheer luck to grab a spot cause this joint is busaaaaay. If you are doung take out order ahead of time (45-60 minutes) to grab a pie.  Didn't get a chance to eat in at double d's but definitely will in the near future.   So me and my wife ordered the classic chicago and jalepeno blue (both small). The classic chicago reminded me of the first time I had deep dish in Chicago, it was simple and delicious.   The jalapeño blue was a great combo of flavours, the blue cheese was subtle and not over bearing and paired nicely with the bacon and jalapeño.  The only small drawback for me is I wish there was a tad bit more marinara sauce on the pie.  This place is legit for chicago deep dish pizza."}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood and tried their pizza once. Had out of town guests from California and wanted to show them local cuisine.  The wbsite clearly states open until midnight. Called at 10:45 on June 28 to take out 2 large pizzas and no answer. Figured they were busy so went over and arrived at 11:13 pm. Was told they closed early and didn't answer because   they didn't want anymore orders.  I was willing to buy $70 + tax and tip of pizza plus a few beers while waiting. Instead the awful service lost them a customer"}
{"text":"The pizza was subpar. It was luke warm and not all that tasty. The sausage tasted really bland. Regular Dominos pizza is much better."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend and we ordered two personal sized pizzas to share. It was way more than I needed to eat. I thought it was delicious and I do agree with the other reviews, best eaten when hot. I liked the sauce, didn't think it was too sweet. I preferred it over the deep dish pizza I had in Chicago at Giordano's. I think this place is worth trying, and I'm a bit surprised by the other reviews."}
{"text":"Finally, a deep dish pizza joint in the GTA! This place has been open for just 3 weeks and I've heard so much buzz about this place so it was only appropriate to pay them a visit on National Pizza Day.  If you have time to wait and are not in a rush, then you could probably just walk in.  Be prepared however, to wait for at least 30 minutes for your pizza.  I would highly recommend calling ahead to place your order.  They'd be happy to place your order either for take-out or dine-in (we dined-in).    With respect to the various sizes, if you're having Chicago style deep dish pizza for the first time, don't go overboard by ordering a medium or large with a group.  Don't hesitate to ask the server either.  The small, in my personal opinion, is more of a personal sized pizza.  You'll have half at most and take the rest home.  Their personal size is a good size, if you're a light eater and you're not planning on sharing. They also do sell them by the slice.  Not sure if it was just today (aka National Pizza Day) but they had a $6 special for a slice and pop.    Chicago Classic - Your basic pizza with pepperoni and Italian sausage.  We did however, add some basil which added such an amazing flavour.  If you want to keep it simple, then this is the one to pick. What I personally liked about this was how it wasn't greasy as you'd think it would be from all the meat and cheese. What I also loved about their pies was the crust.  It wasn't doughy but instead was pretty thin which made the edges crispy.  Very different from the other deep dish pizzas I've had in Chicago, IL (Giordano's) and in Hamilton, ON (Chicago Style Pizza Shack). 5/5    Farmer's Market - A perfect pick for vegetarians as it includes roasted red peppers, mushrooms, red onion and spinach.  We added some anchovies for added flavour and man was that such a brilliant idea.  What Rachel Ray always says \"If you think you don't like anchovies, you're wrong!\" and she's right.  If you especially like saltiness, you need to have some anchovies.  You're welcome.  Also with their mushrooms, they were more like baby button mushrooms which were nice and juicy.  So instead of that meaty texture that you'd normally get with sliced mushrooms, you get a nice burst in your mouth. 5/5.  One thing that I wish they would add is ham. I wanted to build my own pizza and make Hawaiian but they just had bacon. I mean, bacon is the truth and all but ham is the way to go for Hawaiian. You can't give people the option to possibly build a Hawaiian pizza and have red onion and pineapple but not ham."}
{"text":"We received a flyer for this restaurant and it looked excellent, so we decided to try ordering in tonight. The flyer said it was both take out and delivery.  I called the number listed on the flyer twice. Both times it said there was no voice mail assigned and I could not even leave a message. Not a good sign.  Then I decided to try the website listed on the flyer. The website went to their Chicago location with no mention of the Toronto location. It looked delicious - provided you live in Chicago.  Then I called the number again and finally a person answered. I asked for delivery. She said that service wasn't available. I asked why they would send out flyers to local people claiming the place delivers if they don't, in fact, deliver. She said the service wasn't up and running yet.  In a word: fail.   We won't be bothering to call a second time."}
{"text":"Eww. Had high hopes and finally got around to takeout. Ordered a classic with mushrooms. Not sure if it is just a different kind of pepperoni that we are not used to, but it tasted like it was off. Forced my way thru one piece. While family was kind of grossed out. Won't do it again."}
{"text":"Customer service on the phone was amazing but his is what we got. Extremely disappointed and still very hungry. I really wanted to write a good review based on customer service."}
{"text":"Where to begin with this place: Literally one of the worst pizza experiences of my life. The dough was undercooked and soggy on the bottom. The sauce was sweet and tasted like it was from a can (It totally was out of a can). The cheese was like rubber and had no flavour. The veggies were raw: Big chucks of raw onion and mushrooms. Thankfully the roasted red peppers were from a jar, so they were cooked at least.  Then the meat; the pepperoni was inedible - uncooked slices of cardboard. The rosemary - tinted Krusty-brand imitation gruel \"Italian sausage\" was also a disaster. Tasted like when you go a friend's house and they have no clue how to cook. Save your money ($34) for a large and 35-45 min and go anywhere other than this sore excuse for a deep dish (or any) pizza place. 1 star is generous."}
{"text":"Went here for Wednesday night dinner, ordered two small pizzas chicago classic and jalapeno blue, the pizzas took 40 mins to make like the sign says. The Chicago classic i thought was a lot better than the blue it had more sauce and just put together well except on both pizzas the crust on the top edges burnt . I really liked the tomato sauce it was kind of sweet which was most of the flavor, next time I would just get a Chicago classic to go because of the limited seating"}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I WOULD! Just barely scarfed down this SORRY SAD EXCUSE OF A DEEP DISH PIZZA. More like nasty sweet marinara pasta hybrid sauce with a molecule of cheese and a grain of sands weight in chicken. Oh, btw, for those of you wondering what double d stands for, it's DISAPPOINTMENT AND DECEPTION. I was (mistakenly) under the impression that after waiting for 30 mins and paying 42 DOLLARS for a DEEP DISH \"PIZZA\", I would be able to enjoy at least a nibble of cheese. I was appalled and nearly offended that the pizza I cut into was so deceiving. I have been duped. Thought I would get three inches of cheese but instead got a piece of papers worth of cheese buried beneath 3 inches minus a piece of paper's worth of sweet nasty sauce with a snowflakes worth of Parmesan cheese. I want a refund because I hated it so much I made myself throw it all up so my dog could eat it and even she wouldn't touch it."}
{"text":"Alright, I'll start off with the fact that it came to less than $10 per person (group of 4) to enjoy the vegetarian deep dish pizza. Now the deep dish pizza wasn't the real thing but honestly for the price we paid it was good value! The deep dish was overflowed with tomato sauce and kind of tasted like lasagna. I don't think I will return but visiting Double D's made me want to start on a new quest to find the ultimate deep dish in GTA. 3 stars for motivation!"}
{"text":"If i could give it 0 stars, i would.  I went Double D's on Gerrard before and thought this would be the same experience. Little did I know. Google, yelp, the internet said this place opened at 5PM on Sundays, today. I arrived around 5:20 and there was a paper sign written in marker saying \"opening at 5:30.\" Fair - okay so I left to buy some things and came back at 5:45. There was the same sign but now said \"opening at 6:30\". The guys are walking around the inside of the run down place. What the heck I already paid for parking for absolutely nothing. I will never come back and I hope you dont either. They dont know the first thing about running a business. If they are associated with the location at Gerrard, I hope the franchise owner cuts ties with this one. Just some advice."}
{"text":"Tips: (1) Make sure you have plenty of time when planning to eat here (2) You need to ask them to cut the pizza (3) Eat quickly before the cheese hardens.     First time having deep dish pizza and it's as filling as I've heard it is. A large feeds 3 people. We were a group of 9 and arrived at 5pm so we could get a table. There's about 5 tables and the bar so we ended up sitting at two tables by each other.   Ordered the large vegetarian pizza as soon as we arrived and it took about 30-45mins to come out. The inside was warm but not hot. It was pretty good but nothing worth raving about.   Our friends who ordered a large Canadian pizza waited more than an hour for their pizza. The medium blue cheese took about an hour - smaller pizzas take less time in the oven.   The service could have been more attentive but I understand that they got busier as it got later."}
{"text":"I love pizza. Thin crust, meaty, white, deep dish anything. Meaning to try Double D's and glad to finally get here. It's deep and it's delicious. The crust itself is fairly thin and crispy and tasty. The sauce was perfect and let's face it the sauce makes the pizza. Going to Chicago next week will see how Double D's holds up. I'm sure it will stand tall and proud. If you love pizza, deep or not do yourself a favour and eat here. Btw it's not a peeler joint hahaha..."}
{"text":"horrible absolutely disgusting. we weren't served pizza. we were served hot soupy pasta. we came in 15mins before closing. so after the girl made our pizza, she put plastic bags on both sides of the box so we wouldn't see the pizza! she said it's hot and heavy so it's easier to hold with the plastic bags. the next day i called and she said because she added extra chicken, she warned us it would get watery. this is absolutely false because we wanted a deep dish pizza. not watery pasta. she never told us! i told her i took photos and she said i can show the owner because she wasn't there the next day and he might give a \"$10-$20\" giftcard. the pizza was $35 and she totally ripped us off. i didn't bother to go back because i live an hour away. please save your money and time and don't go here!"}
{"text":"I visited this location for pick up. I ordered the small Chicago style. Was more than enough for two people.   The service was great for having just opened (I think they opened same day) took about 20 min, and the pizza was still hot when I got home.   As for the pizza, as mentioned the sauce is on the sweeter side. Not as much cheese as I expected, but still good, and I didn't really like the pepperoni in the pizza. I think next time I'd just get sausage and extra cheese.   As for authenticity, I still prefer the deep dish pizza in Chicago but this place is a good substitute until the next time I'd able to travel there.  Have been here three times and the pizza has been pretty consistent each time."}

{"text":"We got the Chicago Classic deep dish pizza. The wait was 15 mins for the pizza, which was pretty good considering they make it from scratch. The pizza had a good thick layer of cheese that was surprisingly not overwhelming for the overall flavour. The cheese almost didn't taste like much at all, no particular sharpness or saltiness, but contributed to the texture of the pizza. It has a thin all-round pizza dough layer and a nice tomato sauce with meat. I found the sauce quite nice and that it complemented the cheese. However, my friends thought the sauce was too sweet. It is indeed on the sweeter side but it was an ideal amount in my opinion, so it may just come down to personal preference. Looking forward to trying their other pizzas! Note: this location does not have seats, only standing tables."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Chicago style deep dish pizza. I've thought for years Toronto would be a great market for a Lou Malnati's kind of restaurant. My partner and I decided to join Double D's on this past Sunday for dinner.    The space is tight but decently appointed. It definitely looked like an indie restaurant in the initial stages of growth. We were sat at the bar pretty quickly.   Service is extremely subpar. We sat at the bar for about 10 minutes while the staff ran around chaotically. Double D's seats about 25 people and they had about 7 staff on between the kitchen (open concept kitchen) and service. One of the bartenders stood in front of us for a couple of minutes upon arrival and didn't even acknowledge we had sat down or offer us drinks, spent more time fiddling with the tv's than serving drinks at the bar. We had sat at the corner of the bar and as a result we had to listen to the incredible inappropriate conversations of 2 girls who were working in the kitchen as the came to the bar to drink. I found it incredible we hadn't even been offered a drink and the staff were blatantly drinking in front of guests who hadn't even been served.    The pizza was decent. The crust, ingredients and sauce were pretty good. Unfortunately the center of the pie was not cooked properly and was cold. We would have mentioned this to a staff member had they been interested in our experience. Its a shame because the pizza has the potential to be great but lack of quality control leaves them unaware of the quality of their product.    We finished our meal and drinks and then waited, and waited for a sever to offer us another drink. That moment never came, finally after 10 minutes of waiting we asked for the bill.    Its truly a shame that the service sucked. Double D's has all the potential but the staff seemed more interested in serving themselves then the guests."}
{"text":"Ordered take out through Uber eats. Way too expensive for what we got. We did a build your own pizza and the add on toppings were very pricey. I would have expected more toppings for the amount I paid. I wasn't really a fan on the sauce, too sweet for my taste. The crust was pretty good. Overall it was the messy cheesy deep dish I was expecting, but I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Came here tonight to pick up a medium sized Jalapeno blue. I called in the order and was told it'd be a 40-45 minute wait. Came right at 45 minutes and the pizza was already waiting for me.  If you are used to a more sauce-laden filling, this is not it. It could have been our choice of toppings, but we both agreed that the time bringing our dinner back across the city might have had something to do with the toppings getting a bit stiff if you will.  I will say... the flavour combination was surprisingly delicious. The sauce on top had a tangy, sweet flavour. I don't usually go for bacon in my pizza, but the combination of blue cheese was perfect, I have to say. The medium provided four very large slices.  I think I'd like to come back to try one fresh out of the oven. The place itself is tiny so I foresee it being a busy spot.  The service for takeout was friendly, as it was over the phone."}
{"text":"Big disappointment if you've had actual deep dish in Chicago.  The crust was not buttery enough and the sausage was crumbly.  Was really looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"Been here like 2-3 times an each time was amazing an the ppl here r so friendly which makes this place even better"}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this place..  Came on a quiet Sunday winter night, with a table for 3 readily available.  There's not a lot of seating but we got a spot right away.  Great vibe from the place - young server and cook, friendly and relaxed.  We split the largest size among the three of us and truthfully I could have had more.  I really enjoyed the Hawaiian - tasty, large, cooked just perfect.  A unique style of pizza that's for sure.  Worth a visit - I thought the whole experience was great."}
{"text":"Super excited that I don't have to make a trip to Chicago to try deep dish pizza! This restaurant is tiny with only 4 tables and a bar. We waited at least 40mins for a table for 3 people  We ordered a medium Classic Chicago with additional toppings of bacon, olives and basil. They don't have a drink menu but the server can tell you what they have.  $5 beer and $6 tap  The pizza came in about 30~minutes. The layering from bottom to top: crispy crust, cheese, meat, cheese, olives, basil, and finally doused in a saucy tomato sauce.  Surprisingly it wasn't greasy as I thought it would be since it was loaded with cheese. The sauce is on the sweeter side rather than savoury, which I didn't mind and quite enjoyed. Though I wished they didn't skimp on the olives.  On another note the pizza is only good when it's hot. When it's cooled, the cheese hardens and gives a rubbery texture. I like how the tables have parmesan and chili peppers shakers if you want more seasoning.  A medium pizza with no additional toppings is $29. A medium is ok for 3 people to share since the dish is on the 'heavy' side, but my party and I could have eaten another slice each.  A trip to Chicago is much needed to compare how authentic this is. But I had a great experience. I enjoyed the pizza and it was delicious. I would definitely come back if the wait isn't too long.  Decent and prompt service"}
{"text":"Came here during a late night, close to the time when this place was going to close and they still seated us.  We ordered a regular sized deep dish with jalapeno, blue cheese, Italian sausage and bacon.  The pizza was perfectly balanced between all the flavours. Sweet, salty and spicy. We also ordered some drinks to go with it, they have a pretty small drink menu but of course this place's main focus is the pizza which was delicious.  The size of the pizza was pretty big to share between two people, we ended up taking some of it home, which was weird considering the two of us do eat a lot and we were super hungry after work.  The staff are really friendly especially the chefs. We sat at the table that was closest to the kitchen and they were really friendly.  The place itself is quite small so if you have a really large group, you may need to wait a while to get seats.  Things to improve on is the waiting staff, they didn't really come to check on us and it took a while for our bill to come and we had to ask for it multiple times. Also for a place that has a bar, there wasn't much variety or choice for drinks. Then again, it's quite a small place.  Still, the food here is amazing and we enjoyed our time here.  Definitely would return."}
{"text":"Okay so, I really enjoy a good deep dish. I had it in Chicago, and cannot wait to go back, and I had it at a cool spot in Hamilton and loved it there too, but if I am being honest, I really did not like Double D's. The sauce was much too sweet for my liking, they didn't even get our order right (we ordered the Farmers Market pizza with no peppers, as my friend has an aversion, yet there was an abundance of peppers), AND I (me, the sole vegetarian out of 3 people) found a piece of bacon in my 2nd slice of pie!!!! What is up with that??? I was disappointed, but alas we had taken our za to go (the place is busy, I will give them that), so I did not get to express my disappointment. I would not come back here, sorry Double D's, but I'll stick to my West-end pizza joints!"}
{"text":"So my confession is I love deep dish pizza. I like thin too but I love the chewiness of thick dough pizza. So knowing this, you'll understand my review.  It's heavy with ingredients which I think many people may like. So you get lots of meat or veggies but dough not so much.  So it's not for me, I tried a slice & pop $7 which I think is reasonable considering the amount of ingredients in a slice. The crust surprisingly holds up and you could pick it up and bite it.   So if you don't want to go cause you think you'll be getting too much bread/carbs, don't worry, give it a try, you might be a fan."}
{"text":"I think it's ok but I was hoping for a little more. The overall taste was ok but I really didn't care for the pepperoni or sausage that they used. The sauce and crust were good and the cheese was sufficient. I think if they changed the source of the toppings they could easily be five-star. The prices are a big steep but with the amount of ingredients they are jamming into the pizza I think it's not unreasonable."}
{"text":"Not happy at all walk in and told too stand out side in -5 cold weather won't not even let me read a menu for 2 min too Evon see if I wanted to even wait 1 hr in the cold this place I would not recommend too anyone who is hungry and looking for good food and good service you won't get it at double d\"S don't waste your time and money"}
{"text":"The pizza here smells delicious and the moment you walk in your nostrils are filled with the aroma of baked pizza dough  Pizzas are baked fresh to order and take about 30-40min.  So settle in for a drink and enjoy some sports on the telly and just take a deep breath.   We didnt have the time to wait as we had to make a Raptor's game so opted for the slice (meat or veg) and a pop for $6.  What a deal!  Cant wait to dig in!"}
{"text":"Doesn't live up to the hype. Personal pizzas are small for \"Chicago style deep dish.\"   Place is extremely cramped and busy, may be better suited for take out only, though I don't expect deep dish pizza to travel well.   Service wasn't super friendly, and the staff kept giving off the impression that they were annoyed that the restaurant was busy. I also agree with one of the reviews below that the sauce was sweeter than most - I didn't love it.  I am okay with the 40 minute wait - however, I am not okay with there being no appetizers on the menu. This will hopefully change.   I'm happy I tried it but most likely will not return. Might be better received by someone who has never had authentic Chicago Deep Dish, but for me it was a bit of a let down."}
{"text":"Very good, love the sauce. I was hoping for it to be a bit more filling but still great and incredible aroma. Be prepared to wait, for both a seat and the pizza. Medium (which is about same size as a basketball) is 30min. The large is 40 min wait. About an inch and a half thick."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon around 4. We were fortunate we were the first ones to arrive at that hour, so the pizza took about 20 minutes. We ordered a small Chicago style with black olives and extra cheese between 2 people with 2 pints of beer. Overall, I felt it was a good first deep dish pizza experience. I'd definitely go back to try other toppings."}
{"text":"The bread is delicious as they make it themselves. The attitude is also rate 5/5, very nice people. BUT it is not the deep dish Chicago pizza that they have. It is delicious if you like very spicy (even though the waitress said a kid can have it as it is not spicy, I couldn't feel my tongue after 1 slice!). So go there if you like good pizza bread and a lot of tomato sauce with cheese, but not if you want a deep dish pizza!"}
{"text":"We Arrived at 11:45pm and the staff hurried us out of their pizzeria as fast as possible. They insisted they were closed.   I understand it's Saturday and the staff may of wanted their weekend to start early, but to push 6 paying patrons from their establishment 2 hours before their posted closing time  is pretty unacceptable."}
{"text":"This place is a big disappointment. I am a native Chicagoan and this place does not what they are doing with pizza. One it's overpriced, two, pizza is way undercooked, skippy on the toppings, sauce is tasteless. Pizza was cold needed 30% less cheese , 50% more toppings and another 20 minutes in the oven. Hopefully they figure it out and change and go to Chicago and try some pizza maybe."}
{"text":"Overwhelmed with cheese!  It was my first time trying \"Chicago style\" pizza, so I had no expectations of how it should be.  Came here on a Saturday afternoon with a friend and the restaurant was surprisingly quiet. We were immediately seated and the server was very helpful, explaining to us about the sizes available. We ordered a large meat lovers and two glasses of the same beer.  The beer came quickly, although poured unskillfully...? One had the perfect amount of head while the other was just flat without foam. It wasn't a big issue but I was just a bit surprised at the presentation.  Anyway, our pizza came and the server was kind to remind us that it was hot and advised us to let it cool down a few minutes before taking the first bite. The pizza deflated a bit as we let it sit. The taste was perfect, not greasy at all and had a ton of cheese. Unfortunately, we didn't see much of the meat lover toppings. I'm really not sure how a Chicago deep dish pizza should be, so we just let it go.  In the end, we were quite full from all the cheese but it was satisfying.  We were able to take home the leftover pizza (about 2 slices) with their takeout box and I was surprised how heavy it was.  Good value! Worth a try."}
{"text":"Being told by a recorded message that the voicemail is not set up is not what you want your customers to hear when they ring you up. That is what I got however when I called them five times, thinking I can place an advanced order (under the suggestion of a fellow Yelper, since they explicitly state their pies take 30-40 min to make). Frustrated by their ability to pick up the telephone, but still wanting to try Double D's, I went straight to the source.  It is smaller than it looks, with room for 20 diners squeezed in. Regardless my family scored a table just as another party left. Throughout the wait, I can clearly hear the phone ring and ring between the loud music.  Hello! Why is no one on the phone? 'Cuz I wonder what it is, and I wonder what they do. Are you somewhere feeling hungry? Or is someone feeding you?  Who knows how many takeout orders and other business they just lost while I was waiting for my pizza because the of that. The staff, including the bartender, were very busy, that it seemed like no one even noticed the telephone. It is comical and ridiculous for a pizzeria. Though dining service inside was generally pleasant, the constant busyness didn't lend itself to us getting much attention.  We order a large (about 16\" diameter using my handy hand ruler--decent for 4 people) 'Farmers Market' veggie pie ($29). If you ever made spinach lasagna and found it can be soggy--yeah, that's what this was like, with the moist spinach making a mess of everything. The tomato sauce was sweet and liberal, the cheese was overflowing, and man it was a flat but juicy mess. In terms of aesthetics, it doesn't look that thick. I don't know much about Chicago style deep dish pizza (the resto had a few Chicago references plastered--go Cubs!), but what you see people post on Instagram and review articles hyping up the place as the \"first of its kind\" in Toronto (I'm sure you can get this elsewhere in the GTA) and all that jazz of pies with height, those are likely the small or personal size. Perhaps it is more difficult to make the larger it is, I dunno. But I wouldn't get this particular pie again, and definitely not in large/XL.  Double D's is a place I wanted to like, with much excitement drummed up and it's in my neighbourhood (in a quiet but seemingly slowly gentrifying part of Gerrard St--i could dwell on about that..). Maybe they being a new business they have not quite got their groove on yet; I wouldn't write them off as overhyped just yet. But they need to get their shit together soon if they want be successful. Try it for novelty factor if you want, but don't expect your experience to be like a typical overpositive hipster BlogTO post. I'll be back down at Descendant on Queen.  {TTC: 506 to Marjory Ave, one light east of Gerrard Square mall}"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has 3 stars. Probably because they are pretty new. I met a friend here and we shared a pepperoni pineapple and jalapeño large pizza. We couldn't even finish half it was so big. The left overs were amazing in the oven. It was however only about half the thickness of authentic Chicago deep dish pizza. Great non the less. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I recently went here Saturday, May 6, 3017 which was just yesterday. I went with my BF and some friends so we had a party of 5. When you first enter the place looks clean and even has a cute pink and black mural above on the ceiling. The restaurant is designed with table areas but no seating, sitting wasn't placed because the owner or what seem like the guy in charge stated if we place seat then we would have to offer a restroom. RED ALERT, if your going there is no SEATING and NO RESTROOM   So if you want to do either or it's out of the question. Had to use the restroom 5 blocks down from the restaurant. The pizza is pretty decent but not for the pricing, especially for a pizza that isn't close to the Chicago style pizza I grew up on. This place was really hyped up on social media and the BLOGTO which is why I made plans with everyone to check it out but we were all disappointed   Hope the place gets better in the future but it'll be a long time before I go here again."}
{"text":"Good try but needs major work from being true Authentic Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. The crust  does not hold up and is raw in some parts. The crust is way too thin and doesn't hold it's form or the toppings well. The pizza is overpriced and lacks enough cheese and toppings relative to the price. Due to the lack of cheese and toppings, the pizza is not filling compared to the real thing. You can eat 3 slices easy. The pizza lacks the critical top layer of crust that separates the sauce from the bottom half of the pizza. The sauce needs major work, too sweet and doesn't taste homemade. Overall, I won't be returning until they improve drastically."}
{"text":"Not as good as an authentic Chicago deep dish, but if you have a big craving for some deep dish pizza, you will not be disappointed with this place.  They need to work on their process for pick up orders, its not as organized as it could be."}
{"text":"Staff are friendly. I got a single slice of pizza and a can of pop for $6. It was pretty quick when I got it for to go. Only down side is, it is on the messier side but that's deep dish for ya!"}
{"text":"Unlike a Chicago deep dish, this version is still a close second. I was amazed by the crunchiness of their crust and how it wasn't soggy. We got take out and didn't eat it right away so it definitely retained it's texture and shape.  The pizza didn't have as much toppings as I would have liked - quantity I mean. The sausage was grounded. I prefer slices. The tomato sauce is sweet, which I liked.    Pretty pricey for a pizza.   Not a lot of seating available so take out is the best option."}
{"text":"Had a slice a few days ago and was surprised at one particular waitress who was gossiping and complaining about a fellow coworker, and scoffing off customers on the phone. I don't want to go into details but it didn't give me a welcoming atmosphere to dine in. Also seemed to really want me to quickly finish my meal and leave. Service aside, the pie itself wasn't all that great. I got a single slice so I suppose they reheated it up, but the cheese was hard. The filling for the slice (classic) was too salty as well. I was excited for this place but I don't think I would want to return. Maybe one day in the far off future if they decide to improve on their service and pizza."}
{"text":"For $6 a slice it is a good place to try deep dish pizza. The wait is long, so I recommend ordering on the phone before you come.   The  pizza ingredients do not have any decent meat, only processed meat. Ugh.  +1 for the hot waitress. :)"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while. The only deep dish I had in the past was at Giordano's in Chi Town.   There's an obvious difference but it was still a very enjoyable pie. We ordered the farmers market. I would've ordered the pepperoni but I was with friends who don't eat pork.   The pie came out in a reasonable amount time given its thickness. The crust was good. Stuffed with cheese and very flaky and crispy - in a good way. The veggies were cooked well and didn't make the sauce too soggy.   My only complaint was that the pizza sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking but it was still enjoyable.   All in all a great experience. Will be back soon for the pepperoni."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype here. Though I've never had legit Chicago deep-dish pizza, my intuition says that this is nothing close. The pizza is a tad dry and the texture is just off... Wouldn't take anyone here nor come back."}
{"text":"I went here with a few friends on a Saturday night, to my surprise we were able to get a seat immediately and be served. They had a special on pitchers of beer, so we took advantage of that along with our pizza. We ordered the Vegetarian Pizza to split it amongst us; to my surprise it wasn't what I expected it to be. The pizza itself was not fully cooked and had some soft spots to it, furthermore, there was a very strong taste of pizza sauce that almost took over the pizza itself. Regardless of this, the pizza wasn't very heavy unlike other deep dish pizzas; something I appreciated about it. However, the service is friendly and welcoming which is always a plus regardless of the food. If you're in the area, I would still give them a try and hopefully your experience is better than mine."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. There were several long curled hairs in our pizza. Firmly embedded in the cheese. It was an absolutely disgusting and horrifying experience. I still feel nauseous thinking about how many hairs my girlfriend and I ingested.  I found one hair after a couple of bites which I just took out. Because it happens sometimes, but then to our horror we found 4 more.   I love a good greasy spoon place to eat, but I've never been so appalled with food in my life."}
{"text":"Living in toronto my whole life, Chicago deep dish was rare to come by. Was excited to see this pizza joint being offered through doordash so I decided to give it a go! Ordered a large Hawaiian and meat lovers.   Delivery took longer than usual so I had a bad hunch. When the delivery finally arrived, I only received the meat lover with the Hawaiian missing. Typically when a restaurant is unable to fulfill an order I get a call to see if they can make any accommodations or alterations. That did not happen here. Being disappointed from the missing pizza, I was still gung-ho for the meat lovers. This is where it gets worse; the pizza was barely even warm. Despite the temperature I still gave it a chance. The taste was definitely great, unfortunately the experience of the delivery ruined it."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Double D's on Dundas Street W (just east of Dovercourt) ... this is their second location in Toronto and they just opened it on Saturday.  The pizzas are made to order and take at least fifteen minutes.  Surprisingly there are no stool at the tables if you are waiting or if you want to eat it there, which I did.  I love love love pizza and had never had a Chicago-style deep dish pizza before.  I ordered a personal Chicago Classic (pepperoni and Italian sausage).  The crust was really good.  There was a lot of tomato sauce ... too much, I thought.  The pizza and the abundant sauce wasn't overly hot, though.  When I started eating it, it got colder as I got to the inside and I noticed the cheese inside wasn't even melted.  So I took it back to the guy at the counter and asked to have it put back in the oven.  It came out five minutes later.  The cheese was melted, the pizza was hotter (but not piping hot) but they'd put more cold sauce on top.  All in all, it wasn't a bad pizza.  I did like it better once I scraped off a lot of the sauce.  I may check them out again once they have been around for a while as I wasn't wowed today."}
{"text":"Went here last night with jubee service was really good. People very nice without being too over the top.  The pizza we got was the traditional small size Chicago deep dish with mushrooms added.   The pizza was delicious and imo was freakin amazing.   Only 2 things, 1) is that the pizza was VERY luke warm inside. Not hot enough at all. To be honest it tasted better when I heated up the left overs at home.   2) The mushrooms seemed like they came from a can.  Would return"}
{"text":"Massive pizza pies!! Fork & steak knives provided!! The Good:  Super friendly service  simple menu  Only Chicago style in town Medium fills 2 average eaters Made Fresh fresh ingredients  The bad: on the pricey side Wait time The ugly  the pizzas themselves but that's actually a good thing!!  Was greeted by a great server showed us different pan sizes and made accurate recommendations for 2.5 people (4 yo) BYO pizza with extra cheese farmers market  And it was worth the 30 min wait for farm fresh pizza pie !!"}
{"text":"The wait on a Saturday night is about one hour and you can't order until you are seated.  The pizza takes about 40 to 45 minutes to make so you should expect to wait about at least 1.5 hour before you get to taste the pizza.  We ordered take out instead and while waiting we ate at another restaurant.  We came back and shared a small Chicago Classic among 4 of us.  One slice per person is enough.  Its just a thicker slice of pizza with more cheese.  Not worth the wait but the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Worst experience and food I had in a long time. I ordered a large pizza and the veggies were cold and uncooked. I mentioned it to the server and she said we could reheat it. I said it was ok as I already had taken a few bites out of it. The more I ate the more upset I got as the raw onion in the pizza made it inedible. Also at $34 dollars plus tax and tip was a real ripoff for a place that doeant know how to cook. They use aluminum pans and for whatever reason it seems the inside doesn't get cooked properly. The last straw was when I showed the waitress the raw onion she didn't seem to give a shit and just offered to put it back in the oven. Sorry I'm not into eating a burned pizza... when I asked for the bill and to have my pizza put in a take out tray she wrote on it 375 degrees on it. How ironic that they would suggest what to reheat it at when they can't cook it properly themselves. Lastly I asked to if the girl was the owner/ manager as I wanted to talk to someone. She answered she wasn't and left it at that. Service is important when u run a restaurant and a customer shouldn't have to ask for something to be done more than just reheat a pizza when it's badly made. Worst experience ever. I've eaten at a lot of restaurants good and bad and never got as mad as I did by this girls attitude and stupidity."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Server got the wrong order, didnt even apologize nor checked on the table how it was. Pizzas are overpriced for its quality"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait!  Small busy pizza joint with awesome pizza. Try it with basil and blue cheese and protein of choice"}
{"text":"Super awesome pies. Big hit with my dinner guests every time. Classic is always a hit but try customize your own. Yum yum yum."}
{"text":"Ok, so I should not have set myself to believe that this pizza would be like the Chicago-style pizza that I love. Cause it is not. However, it is a tasty pizza, and worthy of a try. That said, please just say that you sell \"deep dish pizza\" and remove \"Chicago\" from it. Don't deceive folks. :(  So, though the pizza was tasty, these were our issues:  -The personal size is too small - the personal in Chicago is challenging to finish alone. In other words, a small in Toronto is a personal in Chicago  -40 minute wait for a personal pizza? Too long!  -No drink menu  -Too many service kinks - though thank God for Brian - he was great. The chick - she was confused!  I know it is a new restaurant that needs to iron out their kinks.....and we will return to see if they have in a couple months time."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza + location, and it's puppy friendly if you eat out on the patio. We visited from out of town and the owner and staff were amazing at making sure everything around our experience was excellent and accommodating. Double D's is a must if you like pizza, and we'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Praise the Gods! I am from Chicago, and in this vast wasteland of mundane pizza. Here, here at Double D's lies a beacon of hope. I am salivating just writing this. Pizza made the correct way; for adults!  Not a wimpy thin slice that you eat with your hands like children.   Please bow your heads:        Oh lord, thank you for this truly incredible gift.    Brought to us from the land of the broad shoulders,     a windy city. May all those who feast upon this     instant in which they are about to partake. A pie    a true pizza pie. That may take its time to cook,     but surely will take less time to devour.  Amen"}
{"text":"This was my first time going and I can say that I am not disappointed and will be returning for sure I ordered the Chicago style deep medium pie and it took around 15 minutes to come. As I was waiting the owner Paul came out to talk to me about how I heard about his restaurant, and overall he was a super friendly person which made the dining at the restaurant that much warmer. Overall my experience with the restaurant was a 5 out of 5 as my experience there was good with the owner and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Deep Dish pizza in general just tastes like too much sauce on a piece of flat pizza bread. The flavours were good but it was just so much sauce and so heavy....."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago we had to try this pizza.  Well the Chicago Classic was very good.   Sauce was slightly tart and a ton of mozzarella cheese.  The crust was good but not the Chicago deep dish pizza taste.  Staff was sweet and welcoming."}
{"text":"I love how filling it is just like the real deal (please refer to my review on the real Chicago deep dish at Giordano's previously), but it is still far from being the real, authentic Deep Dish pizza in Chicago. First, the crust here is so hard and burnt. It lacks the puffy texture the real deep dish pizza offers with its crusts (almost pie-like). Second, it was a lot thinner than the authentic counterparts (less cheese?). Everything (the button topping, cheese, and the marinara sauce) sticks densely together, which lost the fluffy texture deep dish pizza supposes to have.  However, regardless of how Double D's deviates from the real Deep Dish Pizza, I may still visit again. I think the price is pretty reasonable, and the pizza does remind me of my deep dishy Chicago life."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered their Classic Chicago to go, so this review is based on our take out experience. We called and ordered a medium size pizza, and it was ready within 30 minutes. The pizza was right on time, and the host that cashed our take out was pleasant and nice.  We walked 15 minutes to get home before indulging in the deep dish pizza. I wasn't much of a fan because the crust was a bit tough, and the cheese was more like layered cheese curds. My husband loves cheese curds, so he didn't mind the rubbery texture of the cheese. But he did find the sauce to be a tad sweet.  We will definitely go back to dine in just to have the pizza piping hot, and see whether it makes a difference. I've had the nearby Detroit style pizza, and even with take out, and the pizza being cold. It was still pretty amazing! So we'll see what it takes to get there with Double D's."}
{"text":"Visited this Chicago Style deep dish joint with a couple friends and we ordered a large \"Farmers Market\" and a medium \"Build Your Own\".  It is a very small pizza joint so if you have a party over 4 its going to be a challenge getting seating.  We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table to free up for us.  The wait for the pizzas were round about the average as what you would expect. 40 minutes or so for the large.  Service was good, we had a polite waitress who was happy to explain the menu and \"process\" to us.  The pizza itself was not bad.  As with some other reviewer here we did take notice that the sauce was a little on the sweeter side which is not what we were accustomed to.  In addition to this the cheese was not as loose and flowy as expected, and as the pizza cooled down it turned stiff rather quickly.  Points for ambiance, fresh ingredients, and friendly service  Keep at it DD - 3/5"}
{"text":"First time ever trying deep dish pizza, so I don't have anything to compare it with, but I liked it. A lot more cheese than I anticipated which made the meal very heavy. We also ordered the mozzabombs as well. Each one is the different flavor. It was super filling for just 2 people and I was ready for a nap by the end of it. Food and service was great."}
{"text":"This place was just what I was after, some good deep dish. I read the reviews and they were pretty hit and miss, but really you can't compare Chicago deep dish to your regular pizza joint. It's different, but still delicious nonetheless. It may not be the best I've had but it's pretty solid. Don't listen to the bad reviews. If you truly like a good Chicago deep dish, you'll dig this spot."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend during the afternoon and there was only one table occupied. We both ordered a personal deep dish pizza each and we waited around 40 minutes for the pizza to be made. I've never had deep dish before and so this was a new new experience. I got the Farmer's Market and it was really good, they had a good ratio of cheese, marinara sauce and the crust was crispy as well. Overall, it's a good place to try out this dish and as someone who eats a lot, the personal size didn't really fill me up."}
{"text":"I was excited to try deep dish pizza, but was very dissapointed by Double D's.  I hate being a complainer, but it was delivered 40 minutes late. The pizza was very cold, and the pops were warm.  I think it might have tasted ok if it was hot or warm, but because it was so cold the cheese was all congealed and hard, and the crust was soggy.  I put it in the oven which helped a bit, but it was still not great, especially considering the cost.  I would warn against getting delivery from here."}
{"text":"We attempted to do dine in for this pizza, but holy moly it was way too busy.  So that day we ditched the idea altogether, and ate something else.  But this time we planned ahead and decided to order takeout.  I know that it's not the same as dining in when it's fresh.  But there's no way I'm waiting 2 hours for a table and then another 30+ minutes for a pizza.  We called ahead and ordered a small Chicago Classic which has pepperoni, sausage and tons of cheese.  The small size could easily feed 3 hungry adults I think, it's so heavy.  We had this for dinner, and reheated it in the oven.  The crust is nothing like the ones from Chicago.  This is more bready/cracker like, whereas I remember the ones from Chicago being a bit more buttery/cookie/tart like.  Filling wise, there was tons of it.  Lots of meats and cheese.  In my opinion, too much.  Surprisingly it wasn't overly salty as something so meat heavy usually is salty to me."}
{"text":"If you're craving deep dish pizza in Toronto, this is the place!  My friend and I were excited at a deep dish pizza place finally coming here. He then saw they had opened a west end location, so we ordered from there.  We got take out - so, I can't review the service or location.  But the pizza was great!   The tomato sauce was tangy & fresh, with a hint of spice. The toppings & cheese were plentiful, and the crush decent - not the cardboardish variety that plagues some deep dish pizzas.  My only complaint is that the inside of the box had gotten watery, from the moisture (I'm guessing), and it made the pizza a touch soggy at the bottom, in a few places."}
{"text":"I've had their pizza before, and it's great.  Last night, I placed a delivery order at 9:30 p.m.  However, the pizza didn't arrive until 10:30 p.m.  Naturally, I was getting annoyed.  Nevertheless, when I got to the door, the delivery-person handed me complimentary pop and the pizza, and said:   \"We shouldn't have taken this long; it's on us\", and proceeded to explain the delivery error.  When I went for my wallet to at least tip him, he reiterated:  \"No, no, no.  It was our fault.\"  The pizza was $35.  My annoyance changed to impressed.   P.S. I have since used \"DoorDash\".  Do NOT use it.  The app inflates the cost of a pizza by $8 ($29 on the restaurant's website vs. $37 on the DoorDash app).   It also adds a $4 delivery charge, and suggests a tip of 15%.    In other words, total delivery charges are $15!"}
{"text":"Won't be coming back anytime soon. I really wanted to like this place, since we don't have tasty and authentic deep dish pizza in the 6ix. But there's really nothing good I can say about the experience here...  Our server was friendly, but we found out she was new and also training someone else at the same time. The whole night they kept chatting super loudly with the customers at the bar and doing shots with them. The restaurant is pretty small so it definitely annoyed us.  We ordered a large meat lover's deep dish pizza and a pitcher of red sangria for 2. The sangria was average, nothing special, but a good deal for $11 (but it was a smaller than average pitcher). The pizza...omg. After taking over 40 mins to arrive, my only thought was: WHY IS THERE SO MUCH SAUCE? It basically drowned and killed the whole thing. Super salty tomato sauce that just wasn't good and overpowered the whole pizza. The bacon was so chewy that I actually started to pick it off (and I LOVE bacon). The cheese wasn't great quality and tasted spongey rather than pull apart and chewy. Lastly the crust was too hard and crispy.   Again, I really wanted to like this place, but for close to $60 for a crappy meal, not worth."}
{"text":"Ever since I came to Toronto, I have been trying to find a great authentic deep dish place and I'm happy to say this is the place! My friends and I got a classic Chicago with Bacon and it was amazing. The sauce is very sweet and the crust is really good as well and holds everything together. The only downsize is that this place only has four tables, a bar, and long wait times if you come on weekends or peak hours. So come early on weekends or off hours. It will be worth it!"}
{"text":"Filling and delicious. You might be swayed by the price tag on these pies but they are dense so the value is still good. This might not be the place for your go-to, all the time pizza, but its totally justified as a treat. We three ordered a Farmer's Market Large for lunch delivery and were unable to finish more than half. A single slice per person was absolutely enough for a meal. And its the kind of pizza that holds up well when re-heated for leftovers later.   I really liked the balance of cheese, sauce, and veggies in my pie. Not too heavy on the cheese, and a good amount of somewhat sweet, zingy sauce to help cut through all that richness. We ordered garlic dipping sauces and while this dip is seriously yum, I didn't actually find it necessary because the pizza itself offers up tons of flavour on its own.   Would definitely order again and will try to check out the location in person soon."}
{"text":"Wasn't too impressed!!!  The pizza sauce is good and the crust is a good thickness but the options are very limited and their traditional pizza isn't really anything to speak about.   Their service wasn't that great either! The second time I went it was with a group and their was no seating so we asked how long the wait would be for a table and we were told 45 mins so we asked for take out which was also the same wait time. Anyway like 10-15 mins later a table opened up but when I asked if we could take it the server said we couldn't cause we already place an order for take out!! I also wanted them to cut the pizza since we weren't going that far and they wouldn't do it, my place in Mississauga will do it!!"}
{"text":"Oh man, this pizza kills it! Ordered the veggie one and added sausage.  Bit of a surprise, as there was parm. cheese on the top of the pizza - but that made it all the better! Ordered around 5pm. Wait was 45mins.  Went to pickup, and pizza was ready, but wait time had gone up to 1.5hrs.  Order early!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this simple too much sauce, too much cheese, no toppings=soggy disappointing pizza..."}
{"text":"OMG!  Avoid this place. The worst place in the city. It reminded me of the book \"Lord of the Flies\". You have a couple kids running around with no idea what to do. Awful experience!! Chipped plates, warm beer, no AC, and sub par food. The people that run this place are clueless and it shows,  they truly deserve to lose what they invested.  McDonald's is a better option."}
{"text":"What is it with people and this place? Calm down everyone, this adorable take out spot is not half bad. In fact, it's pretty delicious. Also, for how filling these pies are, the price is right in my humble opinion.  My team and I ordered a large Farmers Market (their veggie option) and it was delicious. Three hungry women only got through half the pizza. We got it delivered, and it held up well. It could have been warmer, but hey, delivery hiccups happen. I'd much rather a little cooler than soggy, you know? Way to keep it together crust, with that much going on inside, you're basically magic."}
{"text":"The Pizza really oozes out of your mouth. It's deep dish, it's gooey, its honestly the best comfort food a gal could every taste. The cheese just oozing out and the warm marinara sauce just filling your mouth with joy. An incredible experience still reminiscing the amazing taste I've had a couple weeks ago. 10/10 would devour again!!"}
{"text":"Food ****1/2 Service ****1/2 Ambiance ***  This is a takeout pizza joint serving deep dish pizza.  (Hence the 3* on ambiance)  First the pizza is incredible and I personally enjoy it.  Ive had the privilege of Chicago and Detroit (god forbid I put them in the same sentence...) And this stacks up.   Rather than packing the pizza with 2\" dough, they put toppings and fillings in as a Chicago style slide should have.     Will you be full? Yes.    Will you need a nap? Maybe.   Will you have space for dessert? Probably not, if you finish the slice.   Because I travel a lot, I rarely get to go by and grab a slice but somehow they remember how I like it (cold and frosty, just like my girlfriends.)  Go try a slice.  Don't expect pizza pizza (you savage) or other medicore American style spots."}
