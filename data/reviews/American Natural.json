{"text":"Great pizza and sandwiches and a large assortment of to-go food, feels more like a cafe type place- oh and they have wine!"}
{"text":"I asked the girl named Hope A couple of questions like who palm premium as regards to regular gas because I ride a motorcycle in premium works best and I was given an attitude and told I didn't know I put my car into a gas pump and trying to put my fuel I was asked to see a customer attended by the gas pump I went inside and asked if I could leave my payment card with her if she could just open the pump like every other gas station in America 10 and was given an attitude and told that she was only taught one way and that was for me to leave them out unknown to me to fill up my gas tank and that if there was any change left over it would be refunded into my account in a weeks time this left very unsettling feeling in my stomach and I left the gas station without being a customer of the gas station I asked for the corporate number and I was told that I could call the store and speak with her but my call would not be answered by a manager or anyone else for this I will neverbe a customer of this location ever again and I will be calling corporate as soon as I can find out their information"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times because its gas near downtown. Also I park at the station square lot sometimes and it's convenient to get gas afterwards. Staff is nice and they have the basic plus some other goodies. Gas is on both sides of the shop fyi"}
{"text":"5 stars for a service station? When it's the new American Natural, yes! It's much, MUCH more than just a gas station, first they also sell natural gas for hybrid and cars than run strictly on clean natural gas. 

My first visit was to fill up my car with gas, I noticed the gas was not marked up higher like normal convenience store has is. When I went inside I was shocked to see a full service sandwich bar selling high end pressed sandwiches like Cubans, Jamaican jerked chicken, eggplant parmigiana, and capresi. Also a coffee station with espresso, lattes, and other coffee treats. In the morning they sell amazing breakfast sandwiches with turkey sausage, egg and cheese and others.  Pressed sandwiches are about 6.95 and they will personalize them any way you wish. Stop in for lunch, I only wish they had a place to sit down and eat.

American Natural is one high class filling station and a welcome addition to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I am dying to meet someone who is having their event catered by THIS gas station! Please, if you have or are, let me know! This location is always advertising that they cater! Nothing says classy like gas station sandwiches for your big event. 

As for this location- Nice gas station. The coffee counter is great. Made to order coffee at a gas station isn't a new concept in Pgh. This location does need to step up their game and offer more sugar free options (like Sheetz & Get Go) if they're going to get in the hand crafted gas station coffee game. 
The location is clean. The staff is very friendly and professional.  There aren't a lot of kid friendly quick choices that are inexpensive so I don't tend to make this our first choice for stopping when we need family snacks. There are healthy choices but they seem to ring up a bit higher when compared to other locations."}
