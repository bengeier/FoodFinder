{"text":"I moved to the area about 25 years ago and Pizza Plaza was the first pizzeria I tried. At that time it was heavenly. As previously posted by others it changed ownership several times. I just tried it again a couple of times. I tried the 2nd time because I used to like it so much. Sadly both times fell flat. Skimpy toppings, all crust with no substance. 3 or 4 sandwiches I asked for were no longer on menu yet still listed. From what I gathered the hours are short and random. These were also not changed in online listing. I made an 8 mile trip only to find it closed. There were limited to no selections available for soft drinks. Seems to me tell tales signs of a failing business. I won't be back. Such a shame. I'd say that when current ownership bought this classic pizzeria it could be compared to buying the Mona Lisa and turning it into a velvet elvis painting, but that would be offensive to velvet elvis paintings."}
{"text":"What kind of PIZZA PLACE is closed at 7pm on a SATURDAY.  Whoever is running this dump now must have ZERO business sense. Last time I try to eat here ever."}
{"text":"Don't let the hole-in-the-wall look of this place discourage you from giving it a try. My wife and I were hungry for deep dish, and we heard that Pizza Plaza had good Sicilian, so we decided to give them a try. We were both VERY satisfied with the pizza. We got 8-cut extra cheese and 8-cut with hot sausage and mushroom. Both were delicious. We will be eating there again, and trying some of their other items."}
{"text":"Sicilian square cut thicker pizza. I have tried all the pizza places in the Coraopolis/Moon area and like this the best. Some similarities to Police Station pizza if you like that style and taste. They also offer a limited menu of some other items. The staff appear to be very organized and customer sensitive. My only issue with this business is that they are currently only open THREE days a week (Thursday, Friday and Saturday) starting at 3:00 PM. They are not open late either.  I hope this does not ruin their product or service in the longer run."}
{"text":"A Coraopolis institution. I've been coming here since I could barely speak. Nothing fancy, but delicious nonetheless. Go for the plain cheese, pepperoni, or the sausage & mushroom."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this pizza!! I have been ordering Pizza Plaza pizza for 20+ years and it's a family favorite. A must if you are in the Coraopolis area!!! Big Sicilian slices, individually topped, and freshly made! They are thick, so I usually order 2 pieces, but men could probably eat 4.. You can even order the pizza unbaked if you want, and cook it yourself. We usually order a few unbaked with our order to eat the next day. I hope you Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"On a Whim I decided to call Pizza Plazza last night and they were Open !!!  They are Open ( Thurs - Sun )   Exact Hours I'm not sure of since I wasn't the one to Pickup the Order.  If you get their Pizza at the Store it still as Good as Ever."}
{"text":"BEST pizza i've ever had. I grew up in Western PA with a lot of Italian eateries around and this tastes like my childhood! Every time I visit home I make my mom and dad order this for me. It's delicious thick sicilian squares with a robust sauch and tons of fresh mozzarella. You can order by the slice and so you can customize toppings for your slices. It's marvelous!"}
{"text":"The best Sicilian pizza anywhere!  We were pleasantly surprised when we tried it."}
{"text":"Best Sicilian style pizza anywhere! I grew up with this pizza and I'm so glad it's still around. We get it every time we come back to visit. So happy they're now selling their pizza in stores (in frozen section) so I can bring it back to Houston with me each visit!"}
{"text":"Updating my review by taking a star off because of their new very limited hours! They make it difficult to order their pizza!"}
{"text":"If you like square pizza then give the Pizza Plaza a try.  I have been a fan for a lot of years.  You can buy the square pizza baked or unbaked.  Depends on your needs.  They also make a round pizza that is awesome with white and red sauce.  Give them a try."}
