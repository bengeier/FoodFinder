{"text":"Awful. While the food was fine, the service was beyond atrocious. It took an hour for us to get our food, they screwed up the order, they were rude and then, after speaking to the manager (who camouflaged as our terrible waitress), they had the nerve to just remove the cheap salad from the bill (and this is after charging us for a second bottle of wine that never existed). Stay away from here. You can get charming and good service at too many other places to support crap like this."}
{"text":"Underwhelming......

What more can I say, I have read a lot of the reviews on Yelp and tend to agree with most.
We went for a friends B-day and it was a first for me. Found the place to be cute inside maybe a bit cramped on this Saturday evening. Felt a little close to my neighbours.

Our server came to take drink orders fine, I ordered a beer the others at the table ordered wine. The drinks came, I had to ask for a glass, why is it everywhere I go these days I have to ask for a glass?????? shouldn't it just be brought??? Okay, she comes with my glass, it's dirty!! I can see lip prints from the last patron!! So I ask for another glass... guess what...... same thing again. Wouldn't you think you would check the next glass since the other one was so dirty??!!! NOPE 
I than decided to use my water glass instead of sending back a second glass, much easier this way!! 


As for the food I had the lamb shank and it was quite good, not great but quite good. I really don't feel that for 30.00$ this meal was worth it. I definitely do not think the service was up to par with the prices they are charging. Might I also add the original server disappeared after the glass incident and another person had to step in to serve us. The others I was with were not offered anything else when their glass of wine was finished.

Tati is charging Hi-Fi prices for Low-Fi service. :)"}
{"text":"Pompous maitre d leads to dirty patio serving high priced potatoes with fish on the side (typical fish dinner) or under  cooked medium rare steak with well done frites."}
{"text":"One wants to like Tati for being a French bistro in a great location but the food and the service make that hard.

Having been several times, there is a noticeable difference between the size and quality of the courses served as part of the prix fixe menu and those ordered off the a la carte menu: experience has taught me that you can either go for a great deal and really kind of awful food, or a more expensive meal that, while not awful, is just kind of OK.

The beet salad is good as a starter, as are the mussels. But it is the entrees that truly disappoint. The cassoulet is some of the worst I've ever eaten: salty and flavourless, served so hot it was almost certainly microwaved. Past experiences with the trout and the lamb shank left me unimpressed. Given the quality of the cooked food, much as I love steak tartare, I'm not brave enough to try it at Tati.

Great ambiance, regrettable service, and food that, if you're a foodie, you can easily do better cooking at home."}
{"text":"I order lamb chop that was amazing!
With demiglace sauce and so tender.
Also, we have wine \"Bon Courage\" that is so perfect much for my meal.
Escargot is great too!
We had really good time at here."}
{"text":"The former owner of Teatro, Wayne, opened up a new joint on Harbord St. called Tati. It has less of the boisterous cocktail crowd of Teatro, but the food is much better. Wayne still has his signature personal touch, and often knows most of the patrons. The bar and wait staff are all gorgeous and young and make good conversationalists. It's good for a date or a large group, and it's cute how it's tucked away on Harbord instead of in the middle of College St. mayhem."}
{"text":"There are those restaurants out there that when the evening is young and hungry, with friends, pop up immediately around the circle as we decide where to take our stomachs. Tati is not one of them. It's bistro charm and cute signage does not for me reflect in its food or its service. Even with three different visits, and a desperate (even pleading) mindset to like it. 

My first visit was a few years ago when I had just moved into the area. Since then service, as always, did not change. Slow, indifferent and almost unnervingly so. Simple water & wine top ups is not practiced here and neither are smiles unfortunately. Looking for your waiter will take some effort. 

On a second visit service had not changed, and the food had suddenly become simple facsimiles of the real thing, put together with no care and no idea for balance. The bouillabaisse packed with so much fennel and Pernod it tasted of a bad a Halloween candy. The bavette amazingly overcooked beyond our request for having it medium drenched in sauce. The fish and our blood sausage was good, were the only highlights and so were our escargot to begin. Which everyone agreed was the favorite.

I returned once more. This time to experience their prix-fixe. I sat down joining a friend and waited. Even with a friend who was already eating, and being served across from me it appeared no one noticed me. I got up and got my own menu. 

I just don't get it. It's bistro fare in a casual setting yet indifference marks it in every way."}
{"text":"We have always wanted to try Tati so we were excited when we finally made reservations. The atmosphere is very nice, simple, cozy, and pleasant. The service was decent. 

We both chose meals off the prix fixe menu. My husband had the beet salad the mussels with white wine sauce and frites and I had the potato cheddar soup and the trout which also came with frites. 

The starters were delicious, but the mains were disappointing. The mussels 6/10 (though I tried the sauce and it was tasty) and the trout was slightly overcooked and way too lemony that I had to add salt to cut the sourness. It was also a strange choice to serve it with frites instead of green beans, or fingerling potatoes or  something like that. 

The desserts, creme brulee and lemon tart were good.
Overall it was a nice dinner date, but with so many other restaurants to choose from in the city, I don't know if I would bother going back."}
{"text":"I think they are trying a bit too hard to be French. It's all well and fine, but I did not feel utterly comfortable there, mostly rushed. I ordered a bavette, in lieu of a steak-frites, which was not so well cooked and the fries were luke-warm. They have an excellent wine selection and if you reserve in advance you can get the nicer tables inside the restaurant (I was literally at the door). If you research French, I would recommend 'Le Select' on Wellington, they are the real thing."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food, because we left after a 20 min wait due to incompetent waiters. I blame the owner for not staffing and setting a standard for hospitality. C'est minable..."}
{"text":"This place is great! I've gone here a few times with friends for Brunch, and it was delicious and ended up at about $20/pp with mimosas. The service was fine, but the food and the ambience were great. The first time I had the french toast with caramel banana compote and the second time the eggs benny, and both were great.

I've only ever sat on the rooftop patio, so I can't speak for the interior, but the patio is one of the best I've been to. There is shade provided by beautiful old trees, and you can't hear any street noise.

It was pretty crowded both times, but Sunday morning at 11 is prime brunch time, so that's understandable. 

A great brunch choice in the Spring/Summer."}
{"text":"I would give this place 4 stars for the food, but only 2 stars for the service, so I split the difference.

I really need to vent about the horrific service we received.  First off, the waitress looked like she got dressed in the dark, about 15 years ago.  We had a group of 4 which we changed to 5 earlier that day.  When we got there, she told us the table in the left corner was ours, then left.  We were confused because it was a table for 4.  When she came back, she tried to cram a table setting on one side because it was against a long bench, so enough room to sit, but not enough table room on one side for 3 ppl.  We asked for a different table and she said she couldn't do that because they were fully booked.  As she was trying to explain I started to suggest something then she said \"Excuse me.  Could you let me finish?!\"  To which I said proceed.  My suggestion was simply to put a chair at the end of the table so it would make better use of the space.  That was the worst of it but we had to keep asking for water.  They had a cd that was playing french music but it, very annoyingly, kept getting stuck and skipping.

The food however was very nice.  Their \"pizza\" was on something like croissant dough, the cassoule was tasty, the bouillabaisse had HUGE prawns in it and their duck terrine was a very healthy serving, enough for 5 ppl.

But alas, the service sucked so badly, one person in my party was ready to slap the rude waitress, thankfully we talked him down."}

{"text":"Yesterday was my birthday (happy birthday to me) and so my BF took me to Tati Bistro for a delicious dinner. I have to admit, up until now I just walked on by... and after having dinner there, I'm sorry I did. 

The Atmosphere
- The atmosphere is very quaint and simple and there is something genuine about it. We sat on the patio and it was incredible... trees growing into the patio and it is the perfect location to have a date night.

The service
- although they didn't expect such a high volume and so they were short staffed, I found the service to be great. (the guy beside me was a grump and he complained and hearing the manager and wait staff talk respectfully to him, they still managed to make sure he knew he was an ass)... 

The Food
- Sundays-Wednesdays they have a prix fixe menu for $25. It was worth every penny. I had the soup of the day (Gazpacho) and then I had flank steak and frites - HUGE portions and then I had a pastry filled with ice cream for dessert.... drizzled in chocolate.. amazing. 

I will return to this place often... I promise they won't disappoint."}
{"text":"We found the food decent but to be honest we won't be going back.
Every glass they brought my wife was dirty. (Maybe they're not used to people drinking beer instead of red wine and feel they don't need to clean those glasses).
Our waiter disappeared 10 minutes after our arrival and never returned. They left our glasses empty and it took forever to place our order. When the bill finally arrived the price for 4 people was somewhere around a small mortgage payment. 
Considering the service and food, the price was far beyond what the experience was worth.
 I value my time and money far to much to ever go back again.
In a word \" NO\""}
{"text":"The place itself is pretty nice, pretty chill but posh enough that you don't feel like you're slumming it.  Walking in though you'll get hit pretty hard with the sweet stank of cheese (feet), which can be pretty overbearing for some, but after a while you get used to it.

Save for the escargot and the anitpasto platter the food here was really disappointing.  The platter was full and lively with countless pieces of deliciousness that everyone just dove right into.  The escargot had such an amazingly rich broth-y sauce we kept asking for more bread to dip.

My carpaccio was drenched in truffle oil and that's all I could taste.  The frog legs were very rubbery and tasted like pieces of gum floating around a lemon garlic hand wash.. harsh? Too bad, it sucked.

The rest of our meals were ho hum, and not even worth mentioning.

Oh wait, yeah, don't bother getting the froie add-on, it had a horrible texture and added nothing to the dish except $$$

The only saving grace was the reasonably priced wine list and the friendly wait staff.  They have an upstairs patio as well as one the street, but you can't bring your glasses out after 11pm =/

Do not go - there are better places on Harbord."}
{"text":"Tati is a charming little bistro on Harbord street. Dimly lit -this must be the standard for all aspiring bistros-the dining room is rather unassuming and it gets quite noisy as it fills up. The vibe here is definitely not as vibrant or hip as Harbord Room down the street but it's cozy enough for date night or a simple meal for oneself. Crowd's a little older too here than HR. 

Pretty decent winelist, lots of options by the glass. I came here for the burger-not as good as Harbord's but still a tasty \"bistro\" burger. Soft fluffy bun, fresh chuck (though it a little more fat in the mix could have helped with the juicyness factor, this was a fairly lean burger by my standards) grilled to med rare as requested topped off with fresh tomato and bibb lettuce. The burger had good quality ingredients though it could have been a tad more seasoned. Fries were classic bistro teensy frites, though delicious from being fried in peanut oil-it really does make a difference! I was most impressed with the side of seasonal vegetables I ordered-this was not an afterthought, long baby carrots, green beans, zuchini an impressive assortment for a side! Dessert was a okay apple tart, like the apples could have done without the custard in between. Service was polite and efficient."}
{"text":"Like many others here I had high-hopes for this place. The location and atmosphere are excellent and the decor gives you the impression you are in a legitimate French Bistro.

The service, as others have indicated, leaves much to be desired. In our case it was not that our waitress was rude or overly inattentive, she was just cold and not overly inviting or cheerful as you would expect from a place like this, that is, compared to all of the other excellent restaurants in the area that have much better service. In addition to being cold it was also slow and she often forgot to bring things.

The beef bourguignon was bland, but the potatoes were excellent.  She had the crape which had so much cheese in it she could barely eat it, it was loaded, I mean completely loaded, with cheese. The highlight of the evening was the chicken liver mousse. I highly recommend this for an app. Charing for bread stick and oil and vinger was a bit of a surprise but at only $1.25 we splurged.

Wine list left much to be desired.

I'm really torn on this place. It's more of a 2.5 star place and I could see myself returning on a warmer day to eat on the patio and perhaps try something new, but would definitely order that chicken liver moose again. If anything, stop in for a glass of wine and this on a summer's afternoon."}
{"text":"I went out to dinner with a friend tonight and there were some ominous signs (too many to mention) that should have told us not to go to this place.

Anyway, we went into this cramped restaurant, where it was busy on a Monday night.  There was literally no space in some aisles to walk -- chairs were touching back-to-back.  I decided on the prix fixe, which was a decent deal with a starter, main, and dessert.

It took about 35 minutes for the starter to come up.  The starter was a salad, which was mixed greens with a light vinaigrette.  It was horribly uninspired and I'm not sure why there was such a wait.  Our bread did not come out until AFTER the salad.

After waiting another 30 or 40 minutes, they came out with our DESSERT!  We were like \"we haven't had our mains yet!\".  I couldn't believe it.  Another 15 minutes later and the steak frites comes out.  It was a nice flavorful flank steak with a veal reduction and quite appetizing frites.  Dessert (apple tart) was just ok, nothing to write Yelp about.

The total meal took 2 hours and 15 minutes from end-to-end (about 1.5 hours before we had our entrees), which was tough to take after seeing a number of groups come in after us and leave before us.  After forgetting our mains, I thought that they'd offer some sort of sincere apology or discount and all they did was remove the bottle of Perrier we had.  Maybe my standards for customer service at a decent restaurant are too high, but I was expecting more.

As for food quality, the regular menu must be a lot better than the prix fixe because I can't see myself spending the extra money for something of this level."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in for a late dinner and the service was slow and  hands-off as many others have described.  The space is super quaint. 

The food was solid.  Nothing remarkable, but nothing off-putting.  My only beef is the price!  I ordered the vegetarian pasta special, which was penne with red peppers, zuccinni, onions in a garlic, EVOO sauce.  I was charged $23!!!  Really?  $23 for a vegetarian pasta.  Seems ridiculous to me."}
{"text":"A few months ago, I went to Tati Bistro as a last minute plan with 4 other colleagues for an early dinner after work and we all enjoyed it. Without our knowledge, the restaurant serves a prix fixe from Sunday-Wednesday. This was such a great deal that we all went with it. The other 4 chose salad as their app, steak frites as mains, and I went with a soup app and roast chicken main. The other main of choice was a veggie pasta. I know, not lots of choice, but good options nonetheless and we all really loved our meals. The food is cooked French bistro style: classic recipes cooked simply but with fine ingredients. Bon Appetit!
The one caveat is it is a small room and gets very noisy. We were loud ourselves but because we arrived early it was easy to hear. As the place filled it got louder. This is a popular place, so make a reservation.
Service was professional and fast. I really want to go back and try the steak and the regular menu and sit on the patio as when I went it was still too cool."}
{"text":"I would probably rate this restaurant 3.5 instead. But it probably had more to do with who I was with. My bf and I were celebrating one of our relationships mini milestones and wanted a romantic french restaurant. We really enjoyed the french onion soup and a terrine apps.  Followed by a  lemon sweetbread which was too tart to finish. My bf had the steak frite, which he enjoyed. We were impressed by the restaurant's wine list. Overall, I would come back for the ambiance and the service."}
{"text":"We went to Tati with friends for dinner. In a nutshell:

Service was friendly but overworked. It took forever to get drinks and water, then even longer for us to order. This wasn't because they weren't trying, there was simply not enough staff on the floor. 

The wine list is good, and decently priced if a little light on the low end, with an emphasis on French wines. They obviously know and cater to their local, well heeled, market. 

The food. This is where it gets difficult. 

Our meal was perfectly fine, until the bill arrived. For the amount of money we paid the food simply wasn't good enough. Now, don't get me wrong, dinner was just fine in a French bistro neighbourhood restaurant kind of way. What it wasn't, was fine dining, which is what we were being charged for. 

My steak tartare starter was too cold. Now I know that there's a fine line between food poisoning and flavour, but this was fridge cold, with caused the meat flavours to disappear completely. The steak was served with croutons, as I had requested, but that was it. No cornichons, no quail egg to mash into the shaved meat. I am all for purism, but this just struck me as a lack of imagination from the kitchen.

One of our friends ordered the snails, which arrived with a mushroom stew. Like with the steak tartare this gave the impression of having been left standing in the kitchen for too long, with the juices having seeped out of the mushrooms and drowning the snails. The restaurant was very busy and I can understand that the kitchen had been pre-preparing dishes but this was beginning to affect the quality. 

My main course, black cod, was excellent and the truffled mashed potatoes complemented the dish well. My friend's sweetbread on the other hand was heavy and oily, a sign of the pan not being hot enough when they were being fried. My wife's steak was good but unremarkable, the cassoulet was good but not great. 

In fact, I suspect that the cassoulet had been microwaved, judging from the fact that the sausage (handmade and very good) was so hot that it was impossible to eat until it had cooled down considerably. 

Dinner came to $100.00 a person. For that kind of money in Toronto I can get food that is considerably more sophisticated than what Tati offers. 

Tati is a cute little place with decent food, but the staff was very much overworked and the food was overpriced. I don't think we'll be back again."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Tati!  It was also first recommended to us by the bartender at the Harbord Room when we wanted to sit on a patio and HR was full.  Tati has the best patio I've been to yet in Toronto.  It is upstairs off the back and has quaint lighting and a fabulous old tree growing right through it.  The main floor dining room is also quaint, but if it is warm enough I highly recommend making a reservation for the back deck.  

Tati has a great wine selection, and I've enjoyed everything I've had to eat, - the beet salad, some soups, a few fish dishes, the mussels and frites.  It has a wonderfully Eurpoean charm and as such, the service can be slow so be prepared for that.  Every encounter I've had with the staff has been more than friendly.  The owners also own Chabichou, a fantastic cheese shop down the street on Harbord, with the same Eurpoean charm."}
{"text":"I came here a while ago with my parents for dinner. 

I had the soup of the day (spinach), braised lamb shank and the creme brulee. Delicious food, great ambiance. Prices were rather high for the kind of food being served, but that's to be expected from a French restaurant.

My main complaint is the service. The waiter didn't seem very friendly (which normally I wouldn't care about) except that it made his responses to our questions curt and uninformative. For example, we asked him what \"Amandine\" meant in one of the items on the menu, and he merely replied \"It's a style of cooking.\" We waited for a moment to see if he would elaborate on that, but he seemed to think that his response was sufficient (or perhaps he didn't know the details either). In any case, while the food was good, the overall dining experience left more to be desired."}
{"text":"Tati has hit a roadblock. Taken its best items off the menu. Reduced portions to ridiculous levels. Decimated its wine list. Made good service impossible by only having one waitperson for the entire room, with inept help from the owner. The cassoulet, which used to be one of the best offerings, is simply put unedible (mealy beans, large slabs of uncooked fat on the duck, tasteless sausage--nothing else). I've been a regular for many years, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Hidden on harbord street by uoft, this is a neat little french restuarant. A few years ago, it was rated the number one french restaurant. This place replaced one of my favourite spots in Toronto and so i was kinda pissed to walk in to begin with. 

But the food is exceptionally good, though i have found that with time it has declined in quality. But it's still a nice different eat out. Their patio is also really romantic with it's woven tree running through. 
The food is good, and the best mussels i have ever had in town were here about 3 years ago. But that experience has not been replicated since. Thing's i've had and enjoyed are the foie, tartare, steak, escargot and cheese."}
{"text":"VIBE 
Tati was the perfect antidote to a snowy and slushy January day. I was immediately struck by their signage, which displays a part of its charm. Inside, it's all of the European bistro cliches you can think of: quaint, cozy, and warm. Because it's a small place, we were seated in the middle of the restaurant. I wouldn't normally like this but it worked. A note that it was a bit drafty inside. Bring a sweater! I really like the bar area as well. It's minimalism works. 

WE ATE 
I'm a sucker for French onion soup and Tati's didn't disappoint. It was all of the onion-y, salty flavour you could ask for. And they put plenty of cheese on top. I had the steak frites for my main. The steak was medium-well, juicy and tender. It was sizeable and I couldn't finish it. The accompanying fries were plentiful and a good mi of salty and savoury. At $31, I thought it was a bit pricey for its value. A Syrah was a good accompaniment. 

My dining companion had the beet salad and the sweetbreads. The salad was a very large portion and looked delicious. I had a taste of the sweetbreads and they were a bit meaty for my taste but she seemed to enjoy them. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Tati's unassuming nature and solid menu makes it a refreshing place to have a meal. It's a great date place but I feel like there was something missing in the food to make me a super fan. Nonetheless, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I do not understand past reviews or they improved the service and food. Waiter and waitresses were fast and courteous enough. If you stick to the typical French meals (baguette, frog legs, home-made blood sausage for example), you can only give a 5/5!!"}
{"text":"An excellent reminder of why I adore French cuisine: the pace is deliberate and enjoyable, the consumption of wine is almost obligatory and the fare is rich, buttery and to borrow a phrase from Tony F, \"omnomeriffic\". It's yummy.

Tati Bistro is located near Spadina and Harbord Aves. This is kind of an unsung stretch as far as restaurants are concerned, so it was a nice surprise that French cuisine is represented here. It's rather intimate and snug inside (it's small) which makes it an excellent spot for a date, but a lousy spot to meet an informant. It's candle lit, full of conversations and charming.

The service here is a bit aloof, and perhaps that is just a French thing. Except for ordering wine and our meals, our waiter was a ghost. As it happens this wasn't a bother to us, but could have been if we had a problem or say, needed more wine. Speaking of wine, prices range from $9 - $14 per glass with most options coming from France. 

My date and I both selected from a $55 prix fixe for dinner. To start we could select from fresh oysters, tiger shrimps or fois gras. I obviously chose the latter (I'm no fool) and it was served with some fig compote, sea salt and crostini. The fois gras was really nice and buttery, but not too soft as it sometimes is. The entrée options were seared black cod with roasted garlic or filet mignon with porcini mushrooms and truffles. The filet mignon was perfectly grilled and really savoury. I even enjoyed the butter soaked veggies on the side. My only bite of the cod was an impressive one, smoky and flavourful. We finished off the meal with a plate of brie and greens, and a \"chocolate trio\" consisting of a truffle, some chocolate mousse and a crumbly browniesque thing that I didn't really like. The only thing I didn't enjoy about the meal really. It was otherwise quite delicious and satisfying, and made for an excellent evening.

A bientôt!

Obligatory Title Pun: Drop in and say HULOT.

Menu Readability: Times. All caps. Kind of careless for a place like this.

Need to mention: I believe they get their cheeses from Chabichou down the street.

What this place teaches me about myself: I really need to check Yelp before meeting my informants."}
{"text":"The menu is definitely French bistro, but the execution falls a bit short.  The service has all the stereotypical qualities of bad French waiters - slow and detached.  The place was half empty, but it still took ages to get service.  I can't imagine how it might be on a busy night.  And to be clear, I do enjoy an unrushed dining experience.

The food was, for the most part, good but not great.  No complaints about the soup and salad offerings, but the mains all left something to be desired.  I know there are issues of personal taste, but I found my bavette frites to be too salty - both the steak and the frites.  Although cooked to my liking, it's onion and wine sauce smothered rather than complemented the steak.  My wife's trout almandine was under cooked for her liking.  The desserts were uninspiring.  

As I write on, I'm tempted to drop the rating to two stars, but the overall experience was not unpleasant.  We all had the prix fixe at $25, so that with wine (I thought the list was ok), Perrier, a couple of very good espressos and tip, it cost us about $200 for four.  Not bad in terms of quality/price."}
