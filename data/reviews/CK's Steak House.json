{"text":"Let me start by saying that the food here is always good...  My husband golfs at Quail and we eat there about 3 times a year.  Over the years, I have always really, really enjoyed the beef dishes.  I have had filet mignon, NY strip, Chicken Fried Steak, and their burgers...  all super duper.   What is lacking and I don't understand, is the service!  If you eat in the lounge, not so, but the diningroom is horrible!  The ladies are super nice, but slooooow and unattentive.  Why?  It doesn't add up.  With such good food, a nice, clean establishment, fun entertainment when they have it, why the poor service?    Seriously CK's, train your veteran staff to hop to it!   Paying patrons, I am sure, will gladly reward them in the tips.   Make us feel like we are valued, coming to your establishment."}
{"text":"Okay, I want to admit that the only reason we decided to eat at CK's was because we had a coupon. What the heck, why not try it - right? WOW, it was really a heck of a lot better than I anticipated - actually it was FABULOUS! The dining room was pretty quiet and honestly I like a little more activity. I decided on the salmon and my husband got the filet. Both of us kept saying how wonderful our dinners were. The service was good and our waiter was sort of a character (in a good way)! We'll definitely go back and probably without a coupon!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service, amazing prime rib. I believe there was a live band getting ready to perform as we were heading out. Great atmosphere and knowledgeable staff! We will definitely be back to Quail Hollow"}
{"text":"We recently ate here while visiting my sister who was in town for an athletic training event. It is conveniently located on the 2nd floor right above the hotel's main lobby. The atmosphere was very relaxing, clean with a bar and stage for a band. We were immediately greeted by a very nice waiter, who seated us right near the stage. The band was quietly setting up their equipment, but it didn't bother us. We ordered their fish n' chips and crabcake sandwich entrees. Both were served fresh and piping hot. They made sure we had fresh water, napkins and HEINZ ketchup. Overall, the experience and food was very good."}
{"text":"Can I just say, the waitress we had at CK Steakhouse in the Quail Hollow Resort was a great sport? Well, she was fantastic. I was staying at the resort with a party of 11 - count it, 11 - plant-based, no oil diners. We knew going into this restaurant that our diet would be an issue, but I started off by explaining to our waitress our requirements and she was happy to try to help us. Her only request was that she lie to the cook and tell him we were a club of people with special allergies to meat, dairy, and oil, so his feelings wouldn't be hurt! haha I loved that.   We ordered everything steamed or broiled with no oil and no dressing. For such simple dining, It took about an hour to get our food. That was really annoying, but I blame the fact that we ordered 14 baked potatoes (which ended up being huge!). Despite the fact that it took a while to get the food, it all came out hot and made-to-order.   If you're staying at Quail Hollow and you want a healthier option than all the meat, cheese, butter, etc., rest easy knowing you can make special requests and you can have a healthy option.  We ate breakfast in the CK Lounge the following morning and they were also happy to make us oatmeal without milk and sugar (the oatmeal on the breakfast buffet was loaded with all sorts of stuff) and bring out extra fruit for our table because we were eating everything they had laid out on the buffet. They don't offer a milk substitute, so bring your own or just have tea."}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary, we were expecting a \"Steak House\" feel/environment... NOT at all what we got.  Restaurant had only a few tables of people (some of which you could hear chewing their food) and felt awkward.  Mediocre steak, mediocre potato, mediocre service and high prices.  VERY Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Not worth the price. Service was OK... \"Poop emoji\" \"Poop emoji\""}
{"text":"Two stars is generous for this place! If you're looking for a great place to eat, drive the extra 10 minutes to Pickle Bills or Brennan's in Grand River! Quail Hollow in general has really gone down hill. The place is run down and needs a complete renovation. The service was subpar, and even the manager did not seem to care that we waited over an hour and a half for our meals to be delivered to us. The lone bright spot of the meal was the lobster tail which was delicious, but really only about the size of a large shrimp! The crab-stuffed trout was inedible and tasted horribly fishy. Some in our party said the steak was above average but others said it was not cooked the way they ordered it. Overall, this place is not worth the money. Take your hard earned dollars somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Came here for the ayce seafood buffet what a disappointment.the crab lags,muscles,and crawl fish was served over a bed of ice the crab was almost frozen and mush.the clams was ok. The only redeeming part of this was the cook that was making fresh seafood pasta.other then that if you are coming for the seafood buffet save your money their are other places that will cook it for you and not short cut it. Oh and service was less the Desirable"}
{"text":"I have to remind myself that 3 stars means A-0K.  I feel compelled to give this place more, but that's what it is and that is just fine.  The staff was friendly and the food was average to slightly above average.  The dishes are traditional steakhouse and are flavourful.  A better meal than Outback or its clones and competitors.  On the downside, the mains and sides tend to be a bit fatty but where are they not.    All in all, a decent place and I would go again if work brought me back to this specific area.  PS The bar area of the hotel is \"lodgey\" and has a very nice fireplace."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews we were skeptical but we had a Groupon for $100 so we brought another couple. I have to say it was excellent!  The filet melted in my mouth, broccolini tender and tasteful. My friend had prime rib and it was delicious.  Our server was great and having heard it was my birthday, brought over a tasty chocolate cheesecake with a candle. We had wine, appetizers, good bread and nice salads prior to our entree.  We will go back. Oh, and we were able to converse without screaming over each other, a big plus in our book."}
{"text":"I have had several good experiences in the past but particularly dissapointed with the breakfast staff both Saturday and Sunday morning.  The complimentary coffee is no longer set out for hotel guests, and when I asked in the dining room Saturday morning you would have thought I asked a ridiculously outlandish question, and I was told $2 per cup.  I then ordered from room service and paid 12$ for a caraffe.  On Sunday, thinking I'd save the delivery fee I went down to get the caraffe myself, and was charged $16 for the same exact thing I paid $12 for the day before.  When I questioned the ticket I got a not-so-nice response from staff so I just signed it paid and left - I didn't have the energy to argue.  $16 is pretty steep for 6 or so cups of coffee!!"}
{"text":"One of the best steaks I've ever had here, if you don't eat steak don't go to a steakhouse. Cookie is a great server, they have craft beer on tap, and all you can eat prime rib on Saturday, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner experience, stumbled upon the AYCE prime rib and everything was excellent, can't say enough about our server, Rachel, extremely professional young lady."}
{"text":"This steakhouse has come a long way in the past couple of years. I come here on Saturday nights for the Prime Rib special and it never ever fails me! The staff looks happier than previous visits as well. I'm glad people are finally starting to see how great this place really is!"}
{"text":"We went in the lounge a few weeks ago to see live entertainment.  The service was absolutely horrible.  It took us 20 minutes (no joke) for someone to take our order.  No one even acknowledged us at the bar.  Bad experience.  We left."}
{"text":"Servers are fine and don't act annoyed to be at work. I cannot comment on the steak because I don't order steaks when I eat out, just too boring of a meal for me, but I can talk about a few other dishes this rest serves. The IHop serves a more flavorful breakfast, lunch, and dinner than this place and im not even kidding! Even the 'fresh made godiva crem brulee ( have no clue how to spell that) tastes exacatally like My-T Fine chocolate pudding. Tried the sirloin steak tips, had to send back because to me it tasted like they used franco American canned beef gravy (serious try ihop version, it's bangin, swhy i ordered here, figured it would be same if not better...Wrong!!) all the food here needs a Gordon Ramsey intervention."}
{"text":"The filet was delicious.   The service just STUNK.   That's really all I have to say."}
{"text":"We had a big family dinner here on Saturday night following my uncle's funeral.  When she made the reservations, my aunt had specifically requested two round tables(though I'm not sure why) with no centerpieces, but when we arrived, they have one long rectangular table with tall floral centerpieces. I think they thought they were making it look nice, but she was displeased. Once she mentioned it to someone, they were quick to swap out the tables and 86 the centerpieces.  I did think that throughout the meal, service was great- we had the two tables with 15 people total and we didn't have to wait too long for refills or anything.  The food, however, was extremely subpar to me. Before dinner, my husband, his parents and I came a little early to have a drink. While we were at the bar, I noticed the restaurant's Specials menu posted outside and an appetizer salad caught my eye. Tomatoes, artichoke hearts, feta, Kalamata olives...it sounded divine! When it showed up, though, it somehow managed to be very tasteless and bland. Everything seemed to have been previously canned or packaged- it just didn't taste fresh. For my entree, I chose the Surf and Turf Pasta minus the surf and the turf. I'm a vegetarian and the only two meatless options the server offered were two pastas that could be ordered without the meat. This one came with black pepper linguine in a pesto cream sauce with spinach and red peppers. It was not nearly as good as it sounded. And when the pasta was placed in front of me, it appeared to have a \"skin\" on the sauce, as though it had been sitting under a heat lamp for an extended period.   Father-in-law said his steak was quite overcooked (thinking that may have been the culprit of the heat lamp). My mother-in-law said the best thing on her plate was the baked potato. My husband said his meal was \"fine\", which is my least favorite description of restaurant food. You eat out for food that is better than you could cook at home.  I would not come back here again."}
{"text":"I want them to go back to four years ago.    Back then the location had a responsive and alert staff. The energy from them fueled the ambiance of experiencing CK's as a destination that you could talk about with friends. Now the Bar and Restaurant are just dead -- on a Saturday night (June 25, 2016) I witnessed an empty restaurant, and nearly empty bar! It's a sad situation to watch the rise and fall of a location that could be the gateway destination for the Ohio Wine Country region of the State.  I am an out of towner and use this as my stay when in the region. Since I was passing through, I came to see a band, and enjoy a dinner. Reading through a new two page menu, I settled on a safe bet - Potato Leek soup.  It's a permanent menu item, so it must be mastered by now. I requested a few crackers with it.  When it was delivered, It looked like the kitchen staff opened a eight hour old soup touraine with chunked red skin potatoes and cream that had separated from the stock... almost curdled.  Sad to say the potato had turned to in-state mash, and the leeks melted into the boil and were no longer a flavor component -- I could not find any leeks. To top it off the cracker packages were stale - All 7 packs.  It made me think I got a side-dish of potato-water-gravy.  I could not finish it... but I wanted something more nutritional. I ran through the options on the menu, and realizing the soup was a failure, started considering my menu options that may have the same lack of care.  I ordered the bacon-cheese burger.  The only reason this review did not get one star is because as a \"go-to\" item on any random bar restaurant menu, the one thing they can't mess up is a burger.  It came to me as expected, although they didn't ask how well I wanted the burger made.  The kitchen feels like everything it serves is uninspired cooking. Although the staff in the kitchen want to make and present a good product, they are probably as disgusted as me. I'm sure the group had previous restaurant kitchen experience or are trained in culinary arts. However, it feels as if they are dejected from a lack of chef management direction/guidance. I'm assuming they have a \"call it in\" chef who leaves for the weekend with pre-made everything but burgers. Is there a chef there anymore?  CK's Lounge is inside a expansive part 2 and 3 story hotel on a country club golf course. They provide over 200 rooms (by recollection) and sits right off the I-90. The golf course is built around upscale homes and provides a great facility for hosting events. Somewhere in recent time, the facility was sold off to an out of state investor group. The changes to the entire property were noticed quickly within one year -- the restaurant and bar were the first to feel different.  In-season this place should be a welcome location for regional visitors (to the wine region to the east, and indirectly boaters.)  In the off-season, your customers better be locals who want a place to go to and have a good time (live music and dinner.)   The changes were obvious and from looks of it the kitchen and bar were first on the block to get cut. I feel it's too late for an immediate mea culpa on the changes, however the place is still a viable facility in a very important location on the map. The only thing the management company needs to do is rely on local staff to make judgement calls on behalf of what's best for the location.  I cannot speak for hotel management or owners, but I can speak for CK's Steakhouse and Lounge.  - Change the name.  CK's lounge is now a stigma to the brand that was CK's lounge. Reinvent yourself. Come up with a change in the restaurant and bar name and continue reading below.  - Get a regional Cleveland Chef to reinvent the entire menu basing ALL the items on Ohio ingredients. Use regional farmers and produce. Perhaps use a very under marketed aspect to the region and bring Amish produced food or meal components like breads and noodles.  - Drop your dependance on Sysco and US Foods for frozen foodstuff and side-dishes -- we know when you use them. Any customer can go to any mid-size national chain and get the same food. Everything should be purchased fresh.  - Return to the bar and provide live entertainment consistently. I know the bar attendance is primarily provided by guests at the Quail Hollow \"resort\" however this is where marketing locally will help fill the seats and tables a bit more.  - Start marketing with the wineries to the east -- 20 miles is not a lot when you consider the expanse that is the Napa valley wineries. You are totally isolating yourself by trying to be a first stop out of Cleveland. If I was visiting the region, I would not want to stay at your facility.  That's about it.  I've got more energy to spend on this if anyone is willing to talk to me from Quail Hollow, or CK's Steak and Lounge. I would not write this type of review if I didn't care about the place. Growth is not 90 days. It takes years of nurturing to be good."}
