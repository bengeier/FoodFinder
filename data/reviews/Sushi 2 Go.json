{"text":"Love the friendly staff at this place and so pleased they are open again after the kitchen fire.  New decor is much better.  Food is great.  I always appreciate a place that tries hard and is appreciative of their customers.  Lunch specials rock."}
{"text":"Our past three visits have been horrible, our order was completely forgotten once and overall the service is now terrible, slow and always getting something wrong.  We have loved this place for the past 5+ yrs and were excited for a new and bigger location, but that's all it is, aesthetics, the quality of the food is just okay now and I'm not sure that's enough to make me keep tolerating the awful service we have been getting."}
{"text":"Awful. I will never go here again. I was here with two friends for dinner. We opted to try something else other than Momiji and boy did I regret it. The service was terrible. We waited forever for our food, and two of us only had one item delivered. After waiting forever, it turns out they forgot to make my dinner, and my friend's. The sushi I did get was mediocre. Lastly, they tried to charge me for a roll I didn't order. Between the horrific wait, the food screw up and the bill errors, I will never come back here again. I'd rather spend a bit more and get good sushi and good service across the street at Momiji. 

Having worked in the service industry before, I've never left a restaurant without leaving a tip in my life. I just broke that rule here. Do NOT go here EVER. Crappy sushi, and the servers are clueless."}
{"text":"Love the food and the interior! It's definitely a go to restaurant whenever I'm in the west side of Toronto."}
{"text":"Had 32pcs sashimi and nigiri platter last week. Fish was fresh, food was delicious and staff were really friendly."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Sushi To Go location to get take out from...the butterfish is awesome, the Yasai and Toronto rolls are also favourites."}
{"text":"Horrible, I paid $7.00 for 6 peices of salmon maki, which would of been okay, execpt for the fact that the portions were tiny. Buffets serve bigger portions then this place for a quarter of the price, this is the second time i got there and leave just as dissapointed as i did my first time there, I would not recommend this place to anyone, unless they change."}
{"text":"It's mind boggling why this place is so popular. It's expensive, the portions are small and the sushi itself is mediocre."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this location. Sushi is great prices are great and staff is friendly. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is only based on it not being the best sushi I've ever had . But great sushi at fair prices I will be back"}
{"text":"I tried a fair amount of rolls (Crunch Roll, Mountain, Spider, French Kiss) and the portions were fairly large and filling. The atmosphere is nice, it has a very authentic feel to it. The staff were attentive although at times, it did get busy if they were handling take out and delivery orders.

A friend of mine had the chicken terriyaki bento box and said it was amazing so definitely the next thing I plan to have when I go back. There's a ton of variety so still lots of things for me to try.

In terms of price, it's a touch on the expensive side for a frugal student like me but still not too bad. The taste and service makes up for it."}
{"text":"Light flavorful miso with delightful pieces of green onions. Bulgogi sashimi bento was fairly generous portion. Bulgogi had slightly burned plasticky odour but ok otherwise. Think I had butterfish sashimi - was best piece with great buttery flavour. All other sashimi wasn't spectacular flavor though texture was fresh , good and didn't have that water residue. Nabeyaki udon was slightly below par because the broth was salty and th seafood was nothing special."}
{"text":"Sushi 2 go is one of my go to sushi restaurants in Etobicoke. The staff members are very friendly, the food came timely, and most importantly the taste was 10/10. I've been there several of times and they are very consistent at providing me with exactly what I'm looking for! Highly recommend anyone and everyone to give this restaurant a try if they haven't already!"}
{"text":"I've been to the other sushi 2 go locations and loved the food . And he service! Highly recommend dine in but take out is just as great with their fair reproving and delicious taste"}
{"text":"I had the plastic left on the fake crab and I ate half of it. Not going back!!!  I will never return.  I was ill after leaving."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight, it was excellent! Sushi very fresh, tempura very tasty, bento box was nicely proportioned. The wait staff were very friendly and attentive. Will definitely go again"}
{"text":"Sushi to Go is an average sushi restaurant. It offers many of the same menu options as countless others in the city. Being out of downtown, the prices are slightly higher than average.

I used to get their dinner combos delivered all the time. So much so that when I ordered from my new place, the delivery guy recognized me and said \"Oh, you moved?\" 

They have a few locations in Etobicoke. This particular one across from Kipling subway station is conveniently located on my way home. It usually has quick service and great food. However, I came here the other day with a colleague of mine and they were hosting a group of 24 people in the back for lunch... (I mean come on, who takes over a small sushi place with two dozen people for lunch?!?!) They only had the chef a waitress and a manger to deal with all of them and the rest of the patrons. It took over an hour to get served but the food was still good. 

They have a small private lot but if there's no more room, you can just park at the Wendy's / Timmies next door and walk over."}
{"text":"I came here and got a sushi lunch. It's a comfy location. It's decorated with with a Japanese theme. The salad and miso soup i had were good. The sushi was fresh and tasty. Service was nice and prompt. Possibly due to me being one of three tables being served. I have nothing bad to say. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We came in at 8pm and did not have time to dine-in. So we asked for take away and ordered 2 rolls. After making the payment, the lady asked us to wait 15-20 mins because the staffs (4-5 of them) were having dinner. 

Why didnt they inform that before i pay ? There are many other sushi stores around that we could go to. There was no customer in the restaurant and they couldn't even serve to me. If the their dinner is more important than serving customer, then they should not be on the business. 

Very unprofessional and disrespectful to customer."}
{"text":"Very delicious sushi. Toronto roll is my absolute favorite.  Better to go here on a half full stomach or it's going to get expensive.  I'm used to all u can eat for 13$. That was the cost of 1 roll. Nonetheless delicious and a definite treat."}
{"text":"I have been looking for good sushi in the area for ages and I final found it! Everything is very very fresh and the staff is super friendly!!! I love it!

It's a little bit pricier than other places around, but it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"My favourite Sushi place around!  I love everything on the menu, I love the staff, and I love the new location!  If you do takeout they serve you delicious green tea while you wait."}
{"text":"This place is really quiet! But it's a great place! It's very cozy and homemade feel. I had the steak teriyaki bento box and it was great! Their green tea was the once that I like... Made from Japanese or Korean rice. The steak was done good not medium rare but still very tender! The tempura batter was done well without over cooking it or having to much batter. I saw that they had some huge take our order. Before we left we took a take out menu and found out why it was so quiet and so many big orders. 5% off cash orders over 25$!another place that I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Amaaaazing sashimi. So fresh and flavourful! The service is great and the food is delicious! I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Great sushi and friendly staff, sushi is super fresh, decor is really nice"}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite restaurant ever. However, ever since they renovated and what seems like they are under new management and staff, it has been quite disappointing. We do not get greeted anymore by the staff like before. Also, prices have increased.

The first time we went after their renovations, we were not greeted at all, had to wait at the door, ignored by the staff. The restaurant was not busy AT ALL. Then finally waved down a young male server. Food is still good although the Mountain Roll did change a bit (no more Sriracha), but stil good nonetheless. 

We had ordered a Bento Box that was supposed to come with a soup and salad. I did not even realize my sides were missing until I heard another customer complain that she did not get hers either. I then looked up their menu again on my phone and realized I was missing mines. After i had finished my meal I had asked the server, he asked if I still wanted it, and he apologized. But I feel he should have checked that when the initial customer complained.

There was absolutely no attentiveness from the server to clean up our plates or follow up with us. My husband had to go up to the cashier to pay our bill. The restaurant was dead.

Second time around, same deal. Not greeted by anyone when we walked in. This time we sat ourselves down. Took them a while to give us our menus and make our table as it was empty. The two servers that we had were very friendly, however, not very attentive, This time we got our soup and salad right away. The shrimp tempura is good, however, almost $8 and only 3 pieces - I felt jipped! Again, it took forever to clean up our table, which made us late for a movie we wanted to catch, so my husband again had to walk to the cashier to pay. No thank you from the sushi chefs as we left. The previous owners/chefs always said thank you to us as we left."}
{"text":"When we first entered Sushi2Go, the first thing I noticed was that there were no other diners. Bad sign? Maybe. But the host/server approached us immediately with a warm smile and greeting. We picked out a cozy corner table and instantly, menus appeared and we were asked for a drink order. It couldn't have been two minutes later when our lovely server re-appeared with our beverages.

Our server was so nice, let me emphasize that. There is so much selection at Sushi2Go that it's hard to narrow it down. We took a long time ogling the menu, during which time our server asked us a few times how we were doing, not in a pushy way, just trying to be helpful, and always smiling.

We ordered California and Spicy Crab Rolls, Kalbi Beef Ribs, Tempura Shrimp and Veg, and Teriyaki Beef. Freebies included Miso Soup, Edamame, Steamed Rice, Salad, and so much Veg Garnish that, even though it was so delicious, we couldn't finish it all.

The miso soup was pretty standard, maybe a little weaker than I prefer, but definitely good. The salad was simply the best salad I've ever had in a sushi restaurant. If they bottled their dressing, I'd eat a lot more salads. If you visit Sushi2Go, make sure you get something that comes with a free salad.

When the Teriyaki and Tempura arrived, the presentation was incredible. The flavour was even better. 

Then, the Kalbi arrived. A steaming heap of ribs, marinated to perfection. Easily the best Kalbi I've had, and the veg under it was too good to just be veg.

The rolls were fantastic. End of story.

The only hiccup in the meal was when I bit down on a Spicy Crab Roll and found a bit of tempura that was just too crunchy to chew. When we informed our server, she reported it to the chef, who apologized and offered to replace the rolls for us. It was the very last roll of the order, and we were very full, so we declined their kind offer.

As our meal progressed, many other diners streamed in and appeared to be enjoying the same swift and courteous service, as well as delicious food.

The food was delectable. The service was extraordinary. The prices were pretty standard. There's a lot of free parking nearby.

Do yourself a favor. Try Sushi2Go."}
{"text":"I love this place.
One of my favourite spot for sushi.
I am always order the dinamy roll and always is come with the same quality.
My son got the salmon roll every time we go there
He just love this place.
There are moving soon.  But very closed.
Ufffs I am glad. The only think I am gonna miss is my spot for my car.
Lol"}
{"text":"Very Expensive and Low Quality.

Ordered Miso Soup, Vegetable Tempura, and Spicy Tuna Roll.

The Miso was good, the tempura was super greasy, and the tuna roll tasted very fishy as if it werent fresh. Total with tip was about 22$"}
{"text":"The place is cute.  Nice rustic style decor.  Different from other Japanese places.  Neat chairs by the windows too.  

The waitress came over right away with menus.  We ordered water and tea.  When she came back, she spilt all the tea in my cup and some landed on my phone, jacket and my tights I had on.  The tea was very hot.  Great for drinking but not for my leg.  Not sure if she saw me rubbing it but when she returned, she brought a bag of ice for me to put on my leg which helped a bit.  It didn't feel like a bad burn, just stung a bit.  But it did bug me a bit during the meal.  Guess I won't know until tomorrow if anything else should surface from it.  She did offer us if we wanted to change tables too. I do understand that accidents do happen. 

I ordered the Hoe Dup Bap $16.95 which I was told had the same fish like the Chirashi but included spicy sauce and veggies.  It was really good.  Tasted pretty fresh.  Nice presentation as well.  The miso soup and salad that came with it was good.  Pretty standard at most sushi places.

My bill came and I was a bit surprised to not have some sort of discount or even an offer for free dessert for the spilt tea.  I know that other restaurants do try to offer something or even have management come out to follow up.  Hence, why it only gets 3 stars.  Otherwise, I would had given it 4 and perhaps tip."}
{"text":"I've ordered loads of ubereats sushi and it's always been mediocre and inconsistent. I've just discovered this place, and have ordered from there already 5 times in two weeks - excellent every time! Love love love the king crab funky roll. This place is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Dropped in quickly for a lunch last Saturday. Sashimi and salmon teriyaki bento box and a side order of tempura was our choice of deliciousness. 

The fish was fresh and large slices. The tempura came with a good portion and hot and crispy. 

The salmon teriyaki wasn't as moist as I'd like it but the flavor was nice. 

Service was great and attentive. I left feeling like we had fast food but delicious healthy fast food! 1/2 meal :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Fresh, generous size and mouth watering. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Menu Prices are a bit on the High side for location on Queensway...Luke Warm Tea..Took a long time to get food and we were the only people in Restaurant.
We ordered Salmon Avocado Roll (it was fine). Wonton soup was small but tasty. it was made with gyoza dumpling instead of wonton??weird..  Also Gyoza was ordered and it was deep fried. Should be panfried.  
Filling of gyoza  tasted bland.
Won't spend money here again.
We know our Sushi,we are  rom Vancouver where Sushi is plentiful and not a Ripoff.
Too Bad for this spot."}
{"text":"I went there twice waited 20 minuets to someone attend me. They were so busy with the takeout orders. Both times I left. 
Never tried their food."}
{"text":"The sashimi on the Salmon Lover Roll was very fresh. Compared to most other sushi places, I'd say the salmon was much better (more melt in your mouth quality) than most places in Toronto. The rolls were very good. Not too much rice on the them - the balance was right. 

The prices are decent. Around the $10 mark for rolls.

The staff was really kind and attentive. The only reason why I am not giving it 5* is because it's not like Kingyo or Ja Bistro in Toronto where you get the experience of being in Japan and the food is top notch, but its still very good and I'd go back as a regular customer. It's a nice and cute place to dine for a date or for lunch/dinner with friends and family. I recommend this spot."}
{"text":"The fish is fresh and the interior has an upscale feel to it. But the food themselves tasted very americanized and the rice was overly sweetened. It tastes like good mall food.. that costs twice as much. I'll pass."}
{"text":"I've been to my share of kid-friendly restaurants. In fact, I look for them. I've been to many and for the most part, they are exactly what you expect. (If you are a parent, you know what I mean)

Sadly, as kid-friendly as some restaurants are, their food most likely lacks in taste, the atmosphere isn't very interesting for grown-ups, and let's face it...dining out with your kids isn't always fun.

Alas, people have to eat. Even \"fake-foodies-who-don't-like-cooking\" people. Like me.

My boys and I were in the area, so we popped into Sushi 2 Go at 872 The Queensway in Toronto.  Jeremy and I have been craving sushi anyway. (It looks as though all of their locations are in Toronto's west end)

Thank goodness there was only one table occupied, albeit by 2 gorgeous city girls who looked like they were just waking up from a great night of partying last night. (a.k.a. \"Girls who wouldn't be into hearing and seeing kids while they recap the previous night's events.\") But they looked like they were almost ready to leave, so we'd have the place to ourselves. (a.k.a. \"We wouldn't offend anyone by bringing our 2 kids in the restaurant.\")

We were seated by a lovely young lady who brought a basket of crayons to the table, standard practice in a family-friendly joint. She was super friendly and really attentive to both my kids, offering them water in plastic Power Ranger cups. (My Kids: Sold. The cups matched the little plastic plates she brought with Power Ranger forks and spoons. I wonder what licensed characters she would have brought had my boys been girls?)

I'm very thankful that there are options here for my kids. I know that for a lot of families, sushi and seafood are pretty risky, if they are even eaten at all.  We ordered the kid's favourites: a big bowl of udon noodle soup, a basket of tempura veggies and shrimp, a teriyaki salmon bento box and a large green dragon roll for Jeremy and I.

Yes, not only was this place kid-friendly, but I'd also say kid-welcoming. They put a whole row of Pocky in the glass case right in the entrance way. (Smart, actually, since we left with a newly-purchased $3.00 box upon leaving, but whatever, we were all happy) I also noticed part of their wall with some children's art made from the paper placemats. Also, a decal in the window that said they were \"Breastfeeding-friendly.\"

It was a little pricey for a weekend lunch, but to us, it was worth it. We were impressed at how they welcomed our kids. Perhaps I just never noticed these things at other restaurants, but for some reason, we were really liking Sushi 2 Go.  I recommend you \"2 Go\" too. With your kids."}
{"text":"RACIST place, you may only enjoy the service if you are elderly caucasian. We (a group of four) had to sit there and wait for 30 minutes before we even get the menu. BTW the place was almost empty which means they are not busy. I have to admit that thr waiter and waitress were NOT RUDE, but, they just didn't want to work. I need to go up to them when I order ice cream and I need to bring my wallet to them in the counter, and politely asked if we can pay because we were waiting for the  bill for so long. Also, I understand that area is not a very calm neighborhood but we are not lousy kids that didn't behave ourselves."}
{"text":"I was very impressed and satisfied with my takeout order (assortment of nigiri and rolls) a while back. Fresh food, and prompt service! So I decided to dine in today. The chilly weather made me crave some hot soup, so I ordered a nabe udon. 
The table I chose to sit was unfortunately dirty with soy sauce that hadn't been wiped from the night before. But no matter, the friendly waitress wiped it up. Then I got some salad, which was average. The udon itself, too, was average, if not a little disappointing. It was supposed to have a \"variety of seafood\" but all I got were two small shrimp, one mussel, and one tiny scallop. The broth was a little too salty, and lacked flavour. The noodles were just like the frozen ones I buy from the Asian grocery store. The whole thing tastes alright, but if I factor in the price of $14.95 + tax, I'm not quite sure. This place is for sushi, not udon."}
{"text":"I heard from someone that Korean employer didn't` pay a salary to some employee.
And one of Korean chef shout out to other employee with out reason.
This restaurant must be illegal."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was looking for dim sum on my way home from Mississauga. Unable to locate any in the area, I happened to see this place and figured, why not. I'm glad I did. The nigri maki platter was delicious, service was prompt and quite friendly. I'd come back here if I'm in this neighborhood again.
I accidentally clicked \"no\" for table service. They do table service."}
{"text":"It was my first time at this restaurant, it is a very clean and well maintained. I had there bentobox lunch  special, with miso soup. Very tasty and filling and the service was very good. I plan to repeat the experience with a different type of dish."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited 15mins to get our menus then an extra 15mins for a server to come around, when no one did we walked out. One thing if they had been super busy but there was only one other family in there. Waisted 30minutes of our time."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years, even when I moved to the East end.  Owners are lovely people and they serve up delicious fresh sushi, good portions, and at a reasonable price.  

Their new location is a step up with lots of natural lighting and open space."}
{"text":"Since moving to this new location a couple of years ago, this was the first chance to try the new place. The interior is certainly upgraded and the sushi is still good. We had the salmon bento box and some assorted nigiri. Both were excellent!

The bench seating along the window is a little uncomfortable and most of the tables have one side with bench seating.

The prices are the same as they were and a little higher than average. However the quality is consistent and the service is great."}
{"text":"The food was good. 
We had a dynamite roll, beef bento box & chicken bento box. 
We all loved it. 
Only thing is there was no \"lunch\" menu on the weekend. It only applies to weekdays. So we paid dinner prices for lunch which was quite high."}
{"text":"This is my family and i's go to place when we don't feel like over eating an ayce sushi place. They have the best Agadeshi tofu we've ever had. We've been to many sushi places and this place makes them just right. Soft on the inside, crispy layer on the outside and a sweet sauce with fish flakes. They have good sized sushi and portions. Good service, authentic and fast."}
{"text":"You'd think by the name of the place that this would be a cheaper a la carte sushi option, but it's really not. Depending on what you order, it can get pricey. Overall the quality is good, and the service is the best part, especially if you get the chance to meet the owner."}
{"text":"Not nearly as good as other locations.  Very dirty bathrooms.  The quality of the sushi not good at all.  Service average.  Miso soup not hot.  Tuna rolls fell apart before I could get them to my mouth.  My dinner partner ordered chicken katsu, it was cold and greasy.   The lettuce was brown.  I would go to the Sushi 2 Go at Bloor and Royal York.  Much better.  

Very difficult to park."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if I could. The service we received here was atrocious. The lady that works here is rude and unwelcoming. No hello, no smile, just literally dropped cutlery we requested in front of us and disappeared. I am never returning again and for sure don't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my sushi here, very fresh sashimi and maki, and the rainbow roll was a nice large portion.  Service was excellent.  My wife liked the cup they were serving green tea in and wanted to buy it, the owner came out to say they had brand new spares and could sell one to her, which was very nice.  Decor is pretty contemporary and cheerful.  Pricing was average to slightly above as indicated by other yelpers.  I would come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Everything tastes fresh. Staff are very friendly! Everything comes out very quickly. Very clean, nice ambiance very quiet and calming restaurant"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch with a friend. It was pretty quiet in the restaurant, with only one other table occupied. The server was quick and attentive, without being overbearing. The food was delicious and temperature of all the items were on point. It was a little pricey, especially for the bento boxes but in this case, you get what you pay for. I had a great experience and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I ordered a bento box, tempura, a few rolls and sashimi. My husband went to pick up my order and sat at the bar. I guess I was the first order of the day because the chef(?) was literally working only my order for 15 minutes straight. He had drawn pictures on the styrofoam boxes - cute!

Everything was great. The sashimi was super fresh, the rolls were very well done. The amount of avocado on the green dragon roll was insane! The tempura was done just right. Will definitely be ordering again.. they even deliver!!!!!"}
