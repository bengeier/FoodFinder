{"text":"This is the place to take your friends for sushi! The fish is decently fresh, and they have some great specialty rolls that often aren't found in other restaurants around Pittsburgh. If you have a friend that can't get over the ocean taste of seaweed (the only thing that should ever give any hint of \"fishiness\" in sushi), then have them try the Sunny Day Roll. It uses a rice paper wrap instead of seaweed and is sweet and delicious. Their specialty rolls are quite good in general, like the Tsuki Roll and the Dragon Roll. Our son likes their fried rice as well. It's a pretty simple fried rice with just tiny bits of stuff in it, not like the loaded fried rice you find in a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Tsuki was highly recommended by a friend so we went one evening for dinner.  The restaurant is clean and bright with plenty of seating.  I was sad to see so many tables empty.  We sat at the sushi bar to talk with Mike the sushi chef, who was friendly and open to answering all of our questions.

The service was excellent and the fish was fresh.  The extensive menu had some sushi combinations that I had not seen before and I was not disappointed by any of the rolls we were served. I particularly recommend the dragon roll.

Overall it was an excellent experience.  I would recommend Tsuki to all of my friends and I will go back."}
{"text":"I have dined at this place many times over the past several years, but no more.  This restaurant does not know how make their food with NO AVOCADO....even when it is a food allergy.  This isn't a one time \"oopsie,\" it has been a common theme.  I've had to send food back many times, and they still keep doing it.

Also, they put out coupons and then refuse to honor them.  They have one of those coupons where you can earn a nice discount.  All of the sudden after completing the coupon they decided to stop honoring it.  Very dishonorable."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.  We had two sushi lunches and they have a much wider selection of rolls than other places with lunch specials. The price is good and they also have bento boxes and Hibachi meal that looked good."}
{"text":"I've found an awesome sushi place close to home and couldn't be more excited!  Great quality sushi and great service.  I will definitely make this my go-to place in the future =)"}
{"text":"Went to Tsuki for the first time last night. As other reviewers have mentioned, the decor is not outstanding, however it looks clean and neat. The service was good and the server friendly and helpful. The food was very good, but not outstanding. We thought the prices were reasonable and we will go back again to try more dishes. We had sushi rolls. One we particularly liked was the sweet potato roll. This was something new and different! All the fish-based rolls were good as well."}
{"text":"The hibachi combination dinners and tartars (salmon, tuna, yellowtail tartar appetizer) are fantastic! The hibachi dinners are very reasonably priced for how much food you get- and it tastes just like going to a live hibachi grill (like shogun, Yamato, ichiban) but without the extra expense! Scallops are my fave at Tsuki. Glad this came to penn hills!"}
{"text":"Who would have guessed that this sushi gem is hidden in an old Burger King!  Looks were certainly deceiving but the food did not disappoint.  

The tuna tataki was amazing!  So flavorful and drizzled with a spicy mayo.  The clear soup was excellent and the bento box was good- the right taste and price!

All of the sushi rolls were beautifully presented.  The Valentine heart roll looks even better than what's pictured.  It is artfully fun to look at and the soy wrap melts in your mouth!  The fish was fresh and I wouldn't hesitate to try other rolls here!

As mentioned in another review - it is too bad that the drive-thru isn't functional!  I would absolutely utilize it!"}
{"text":"New owners and sadly I need to update my original review.   Maybe I'm spoiled from original owners but it's no longer the same as we struggled to find sushi that was not tempura/fried.  Its not horrible, just not great...  Service leaves a bit to be desired as well.  Sadly I will be looking for a new place for sushi."}
{"text":"I've ordered take out from here a hand full of times and every time I hope it gets better because it's close but I've had better sushi from giant eagle. I had the goyza for the first time recently and it was not good super greasy, not even crispy, and super salty (w/out soy sauce). Not a huge fan but I would get it if I was in a pinch for quick sushi."}
{"text":"Terrible! Last time I got food from here, it was good. But it was also a long time ago. This time, both rolls were gross! And the sushi was just edible."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place one more time. They messed up my order then rudely blamed it on us. The miso soup was terrible. I really miss the original owners. :-("}
{"text":"Sadly, I have to change my review. The original family who opened Tsuki has left, and it was bought by someone new. The sushi is absolutely terrible. They were not friendly either. I will not be going back. It may have the same name, but it's not the same delicious food AT ALL."}
{"text":"This place looks pretty lame on the outside, I stopped in based solely on Yelp reviews. Went on a Saturday night and the place was completely empty. Service was prompt and friendly and our food arrived quickly. We opted for an appetizer which for $6 was incredibly small. They were teriyaki chicken sticks, two sticks per order. I literally ate the stick in one bite.

I ordered the spicy maki combo, my fiance ordered the maki combo.  Each combo consists of of three roles and was about $12. Miso soup and salad included , both of which were good-about average . Rolls are very good, I wish they had a more diverse combo platter.

I'll likely be back to try some other rolls, maybe try to grab a lunch special."}
{"text":"Eh. I got the sushi/sashimi combo for dinner and am exceedingly underwhelmed. The fish is all flavorless. I'm pretty sure it was frozen. It just has no flavor to it and the texture is a little grainy. The Cali roll is passable, but that's not why I came here. 

Service is good, but there's no one else here, so it's not that impressive. I see why the place is deserted. 

Bad fish means a bad sushi place. End of story."}
{"text":"Excellent! Restaurant is always clean, service is always fast, and food is always delicious. 

The decor needs a little improvement. Still looks a little Taco Bell-ish. 

I spend about 40 bucks for two people, which is a little more expensive than some restaurants, but I'm telling you its worth it! 

I recommend the clear soup and the green tea moochi"}
{"text":"Tsuki is one of our favorite places to eat.  It does not have a liqueur license so we bring our own. The decor is not great but the food is.  I was not a fish eater when we first started coming here but that has changed and I have tried much of the menu and it has not disappointed me yet.  To go to one of the fancier Japanese restaurants we would get the same food but pay much more."}
{"text":"best sushi i've ever had. don't be fooled by its location, torn up parking lot, or its fast food architecture. If you want great sushi eat here. if you want flashy decor, fish ponds, and piped in music then go anywhere else"}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving.  Smells can even be deceiving because I went in there for pick-up once and it was rank, like a toilet was backed-up or something.  I persevered though because the sushi is that good. Also, I've probably eaten there like 8 times and have yet to get any form of food poisoning or stomach parasite, so there's that.  Point being, don't let the look of this place deter you.  The building's a dilapidated, \"remodeled\" Taco Bell (I think) and the vibe is pretty weird.  While I doubt I'd ever dine in, it's for sure some of the highest quality sushi take-out around.  Honestly, they REALLY know what they're doing.  Stop being such a prude all your life and give it a shot for God's sake."}
{"text":"I have no idea why I haven't reviewed this place before because I have been here quite a few times.  Despite being in an old Burger King and not really having any updates made to it since then, this place puts out some pretty good sushi and hibachi.  We have never come in to actually sit down for a meal, but I'm convinced sushi is better in the comfort of your own home anyway.

I will say that their lunches are a much better value price/portion wise, but I still don't mind paying full price (for essentially the same thing) during dinner.  I've had everything from their shrimp and salmon, chicken hibachi, Philadelphia roll, seafood soup, lobster roll, white tuna nigiri, dragon roll, rainbow roll.  Everything has always been excellent.  I am partial to their chicken hibachi and lobster roll.

I've found some of the best places aren't always the nicest inside so stop by and try it out!! You won't regret it"}
{"text":"Found this place while commuting to work one day and decided to check it out. This place has great sushi specials, especially around the lunch period. Their bento boxes are also a great choice for those looking to get a sampling of Japanese cuisine. I found their Miso soup to be quite good ... lots of flavor, not too salty, consistency was great. Their crazy tuna salmon roll is quite delicious in and of itself ... yes, using authentic fish meat for sushi certainly helps. While the food is great, the restaurant decor could really use some updating ... the bland walls don't do much to draw in anybody"}
{"text":"Good local sushi. Very fresh rolls and best of all at a fair price. The menu itself could use a bit of an update , as well as the speciality rolls. However great lunch deals and for the price good sushi."}
{"text":"We found Tsuki by accident on our way through Penn Hills.  It is hidden above Frankstown Rd. in what appears to be an old fast food joint.  The restaurant is very plain and simple but tastefully decorated and very clean.  Service is friendly and attentive.  

The sushi itself was wonderful.  We were impressed by the vast selection on the menu.  I especially like the reasonable combination dinners that offer three rolls plus a miso soup and salad for under $15.  My wife and I were extremely impressed by the quality of the sushi.  Everything seemed very fresh.

I hope Tsuki can survive and thrive, it is certainly a hidden gem that deserves attention from anyone that enjoys good sushi and good service at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"When I walked in and it was relatively empty, I wasn't expecting much. However, the sushi was very tasty and I would totally stop again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I've passed this place almost every day for 2 years and kept telling myself that I was not getting sushi from on old BK. Finally took the plunge tonight and I could kick myself for waiting so long.  We had sushi for two and a Pittsburgh roll.  AMAZING! The only reason I am giving 4 stars and not five is because the restaurant smelled like fry grease.  The food was 5 stars as was the service."}
{"text":"No idea why this place isn't packed every night.  Sushi is delicious, and the staff is very pleasant. Best sushi in the Penn Hills/Monroeville areas."}
{"text":"The sushi was fresh and fantastic. The service was great and the place was very clean. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This little gem was phenomenal. Coming from San Francisco, every time I'm back in Pittsburgh I take my mom to get sushi (her favorite).

Decided to give this place a try during this visit and couldn't have been more impressed. One of the best sushi reasturants I've been to in the burgh - outside of the strip district. Presentation was awesome, prices were great - it's a shame more folks weren't there!

Had the Tuna pizza, which was super clever and delicious. Followed up by splitting the sashimi deluxe (nice sized cuts of fish and surprisingly super fresh for this far inland), the Mi Ne Me roll, sweatheart roll and the dragon roll. Liked it so much I ordered two rolls to-go so my mom could have a sushi lunch as well!

Also, their clear soup was spot on.

If your in the area and craving sushi - don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"Nice place, but kind of pricey for what you get. I got the sushi & sashimi combo, and some Chicken Yakitori. The Yakitori was great, a bit small of a portion and a bit too much sauce. 

The Sushi & Sashimi combo was well prepared, tasted great, and included some fresh cuts of fish on the side which was a nice touch.

The restaurant is small, cozy, and run by some nice people. Very neat place to visit if it's not out of your way."}
{"text":"Shocking!   We were hesitant to go in because it is in old fast food restaurant,  but we are very happy to have given this place a chance.   The food is excellent,  especially the clear soup (never heard of this before today).  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Great prices. Great service.

The owners are always super accomodating and friendly, and I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes for my food to be brought out to me. Like one previous yelper said, the sushi is truly a work of art. 

Though the place is typically empty when I am there to eat-in, they do an incredibly huge amount of takeout business. I surely hope this place stays around for years to come, as I truly feel that this could be the start of a more diverse food trend in Penn Hills, versus just your typical Italian restaurant or pizza shop.

Oh, and the parking lot has been paved so you don't have to pray that your car doesn't shit the bed when you go up the hill. Huzzah!"}
{"text":"As an update, I have upped their star rating.  The decor is not what I want but the staff does wonders with what they've got to work with. 

I decided I am most impressed because they take pride in their establishment, something I find lacking in way too many of the restaurants that are off the beaten path in my PA living and working path.

So, hats off to my server and the sushi chef this particular visit.  My server was very polite and attentive and my sushi chef?  Nevermind the place wasn't hopping with business at 5pm on a Monday (yeah, yeah, nevermind the age-old wisdom tidbit that warns against seafood on a Monday).  Nevermind the decor still reminds one of a previous tenant.  My sushi chef prepared me a plate of the regular sushi combo in style.  The plate was decorative and eye-catching.  I was impressed and pleased.  And the portions and taste were just right in my book.  

Arigato!"}
{"text":"This place should be packed wall-to-wall every night.

The sushi is simply the most beautiful presentation ever.  The flavors are amazing.

Ignore the landscape shortfalls and try this place - you will not be sorry.

THE BEST SUSHI EVER!"}
{"text":"An amazing little spot...aside from its almost hidden location, Tsuki offers a wide variety of sushi choices including my favorite the sweet potato roll..soft and crunchy the rice is warm and the sweetness of the roll is subtle yet flavorful. I'm looking forward to dining here soon...

Even if you don't want to dine in the food taste just as good once you get it home...Yum! :)"}
{"text":"I got a chance to try Tsuki the other week for lunch when I was passing through Penn Hills. The building formerly housed Rey Azteca and I believe turned over fairly recently. It appears to have been a fast food place before that, with an abandoned drive thru still attached and one of the worst parking lots I've ever seen (killer potholes!).
     The interior looks much better, highlighted by clean bright walls left over from Rey Azteca, a sushi bar, and booths freshly upholstered in a Japanese character pattern. 
     I decided to choose the 3 roll sushi lunch for $10.95 I think. I got a tuna-avocado, spicy salmon, and Boston rolls. I also got an order of white tuna sashimi (3pc) for around $4.50. 
     The lunch came with miso soup and I got some hot tea as well. The soup was your typical miso soup, but was probably one of the better ones I've had. The green tea they served was a Japanese Genmaicha, which is flavored with toasted rice. 
     I really liked the sushi,  rice was good, fish was good.  I especially liked the white tuna. One of my usual favorites, but this may have been the first time I've had it served with lemon slices garnising between each piece.  That little touch of citrus with the soy sauce and wasabi really made for a tasty bite of sashimi. 
     I hope to get a chance soon to go back and try some tempura or teriyaki soon. Until then I have no reason to not give 5 stars. The parking lot IS bad, but not worthy of disliking this place. I also did not get a chance to see any dinner portions to compare with the pricing, which I did not inspect enough to recall. Until next time."}
{"text":"Affordable,  good quality.  How is this place not packed?? Just wish the drive thru worked!  Seriously that would be cool.  Happened to be nearby and glad you Yelpsters came through again.  I enjoyed some green tea miso,  and a mango avocado roll at the bar while waiting on a tuna hand roll,  and a custom roll they made to take home to my hubby.  $26? Can't beat it.  Good quality and super tasty.  Seems like a nice family running it.  A little kid was running about,  but cute,  not obnoxiously."}
{"text":"Went there again last night. Had the clear soup, spicy seaweed salad, salmon lovers delight roll and a spicy mussel role. All outstanding."}
{"text":"It's a small hole in the wall place that used to be a Burger King.  Sparse decor but the food makes up for it.  Great rolls and the sushi tastes very fresh as well .  The crazy tuna roll is fantastic.  So is the humble spicy salmon roll.  Service is pretty decent as well."}
{"text":"A newcomer to Penn Hills, and thankfully so.  Morgan's closed in January 2012, and now Rey Azteca has moved to Monroeville. It seems as if Penn Hills loses a restaurant each month. 

Tsuki now resides where Rey Azteca once was, on Frankstown Road.  I ventured in on a weekday during lunch hour for some takeout.  My first thought? COPS. Lots of em'.  So don't go here for lunch if you have a rap sheet in Penn Hills. 

I selected a rainbow roll with a side of clear soup and I picked out a salmon bento box for my mother.  While I was waiting, the extremely friendly waitstaff offered me a free pot of green tea. 

The clear soup was very delicious, and not too salty. My rainbow roll was not the best I've ever had, but still fresh and sufficiently tasty. Mom LOVED her bento box, which was a steal for the price. It had salmon, a few California rolls, an egg roll, and vegetables. 

Overall a decent Japanese restaurant. I've had better sushi, but for the price and service, I am still happy to give Tsuki four stars."}
{"text":"This place is kind of blah as far as the quality of the fish is concerned.  Their service, however, is the opposite of accommodating.  I asked about whether or not there was octopus in several of the dishes because I was trying to avoid it.  Instead they put octopus in the dish I ordered without telling me or asking if it was ok.  They refused to replace it and seemed not to care at all about their business.  I asked them to do whatever they thought was fair given the situation.  They responded by complaining that they couldn't do anything about the mistake because they had already cleaned up all the cooking and food prep equipment one full hour before closing time, and they weren't able to make any adjustments to my $70 bill (for two people).  If you want a great sushi experience, don't go to a made over Mexican hacienda - style restaurant building where disgruntled people with marginal business communication skills serve you mediocre sushi according to their rules while ignoring your preferences and requests."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi. Like others I implore you not to judge this book by its cover. The service and food is incredible. We had the edamame, garden salad and clear soup to start. All were best in class. Then we had the ninja roll, tuna roll and California roll. Again, all were top notch. 

No alcohol is offered, but you can bring your own. So if you are looking for a great dinner, grab a bottle of wine, a friend, and head on over."}
