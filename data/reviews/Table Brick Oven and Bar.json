{"text":"My husband and I love this place. It has changed names a few times over the years but the food has always been delicious. Around fall they will have a duck special that is to die for! It's great to take a step back off of Rt-19 too and feel like your in the country a little bit."}
{"text":"Table is now ON DECK BAR AND GRILL - AND it is as good as it gets!!!    Totally new Sports Bar and Grill.     Brand new on deck dining - new \"fun\" menu - Live entertainment and DJ - Great new huge bar for the sports enthusiast and beautiful lakeside view.   I highly recommend it!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My first day in town visiting family and I wanted to try somewhere new....  And somewhere nearby....  And somewhere that offered vegetarian options...... so we ended up at Table.  I think this is a great restaurant that's perfect for going on a date or hanging out with a bunch of friends.  There were two showers going on while we were there and I think it would be a nice location for that as well.  It's not super noisy (even with the two showers going on) and it is right by the lake so it has a nice view.  We started off sharing the Hummus Trio appetizer.  Although all three types of hummus were good, I think we would have liked to have move pita and less veggies.  Some people may like it, but carrots and hummus don't really do it for me.  I was thinking it might be nice to actually have nachos to with the black bean hummus and crostini for the cannellini bean hummus.    For lunch, I ordered the Margherita Flatbread.  Let's face it- \"flatbread\" is a fancy name for \"individual pizza.\"  Whatever you call it, I enjoyed it.  It certainly wasn't life changing and could have definitely used a little more oomph... but overall, it was good.  My sister had the Southwest Chicken Salad and said she really liked it.  My mom ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger and it was HUGE; they put an entire portabella mushroom cap on top of a thick burger.  If you're looking for a filling meal, then that burger would certainly be one.  Mom also said she liked what she ordered.  My mom, sister, and I met up with my aunt and cousin and ended up a spending a lot of time here (I'm talking about 3 hours- we had a lot of catching up to do).  The servers and manager were all very gracious and never treated us as pests that needed to leave.  In fact, they continually checked up on us long after we had paid the bill to make sure we didn't need another drink.  I really can't say enough about the service here.  I think Table is so close to being a really fantastic place.  The restaurant itself is beautiful, it's on the lake with a great view, and they have an upscale menu at great prices.  But like the other reviewers have said, the food seems to fall a little flat.  I think if they could just execute the food better, then Table would be a 5-star restaurant for sure.  4-stars for the service, ambience, and menu selection.  If based off quality of food alone, I would say 3-stars."}
{"text":"I Found this restaurant in either the Enjoy or Entertainment Book. I was apprehensive after reading the reviews on yelp. I called spoke to a manager, who answered my questions about cuisine and atmosphere. I called back later and made a reservation for 90 minutes later on a Thursday night. I asked for a table by the fireplace and mentioned my wife and I were celebrating our anniversary.   My wife and I were thrilled with our dining experience. We had a table in front of the fireplace and they brought us each a complimentary glass of champagne. The food was very good. The waiter, I think his name was Ryan was fairly new to the restaurant but was very attentive to our needs.  We live in the North Hills, so the restaurant is a 70 mile round trip and it's well worth the drive. We want to come back this summer and enjoy a table outside overlooking the lake."}
{"text":"I like the ambiance at Table because it sits right on Canonsburg Lake and has a beautiful view from the deck. When the weather is decent they roll up the wall of windows in the side dining room, virtually turning it into another patio. There's also a good sized bar with seating and multiple televisions. I've always felt like the place kind of has the vibe that after the last meal has been served they pump up the techno music, push the tables to the side and the place turns into a meat market dance club. Maybe it's just me...  The food is above average, but shy of great. The service on the other hand seems to be consistently terrible. The wait staff is slow and inattentive and the kitchen is content to work completely at their own pace. If you're just stopping in for drinks, aren't in a hurry, or are with a group that is content to socialize in a nice environment, the poor service probably won't be an issue."}
{"text":"I was somewhat skeptical coming here for dinner based on the number of stars, indeed the stars tell the truth. I was unimpressed and quite disappointed by the dining experience here right from the waiter thru leaving the establishment.  I came here with others on a Friday night. When a place like this is virtually empty around 7:30 pm, that might also be a good indicator of what to experience. The ambiance is really very nice interior as well as the location on the lake. We were promptly seated on the deck and our waiter ordered us some drinks and also we order the calamari and crab ceviche for appetizers. The calamari was okay, tender and seasoned nicely. The dipping sauce for the calamari was pretty weak. It was essentially an orange colored mayonnaise. That was all I could taste was mayo, blah. The crab ceviche was a disgrace to anything that could ever be called ceviche. This was more or less garden fresh salsa in a neat cube shape with very small amount of crab garnishing the top along with tortilla chips. I truly should have sent the ceviche back, do not get the ceviche.   One person had a pea and leek ravioli in a roasted red pepper sauce, YEAH RIGHT. Talk about poor execution on every level of the dish. The ravioli, if it had peas or leeks it was not evident, the sauce was basically a cream sauce with some 4 red pepper strips placed into just before being served. Very Bland.   Another friend and I each had the pork shank which was actually pretty good. It was very tender and the flavor was good, but not over the top. The green beans where perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes where probably the best food item I had tried all night.  The Waiter was pretty below average as well. One would expect in a dining establishment  that is touting a refined menu with moderate prices, that the waiter would have had a good idea of; what the menu items were, how they tasted, and at the very least you knew how to pronounce the menu items that were the night's specialty items.  I guess when the waiter has no interest in good food and is just working this job for the summer for tips what can you expect.   I felt that the waiter just wanted to close our tab and head out for the night, so we closed out our tab and then we never saw him again. We did BYOB bring your own bottle and where charged the $10 corking fee. The event that really topped off my souring taste for the evening occurred when we were leaving for the evening. Another person in my party was carrying the bottle with about a glass left of wine in it out the door when the bartender rudely shouted at me to tell my friend to comeback we need a bag for the bottle and a receipt to make sure we paid the corking fee. She couldn't find our waiter probably because he had left immediately after we closed our tab. So it took some time for her to try and find our receipt. She couldn't find it and then just wrapped up the bottle in a plastic bag and said we where fine to go even though she couldn't find our bill. This essentially made me feel as if she thought we were trying to steal something. The quality of the food was not in line with the price of the food.    So in the end the best part of the evening was some good conversation with friends, I will never recommend or go back to Table again."}
{"text":"Table is amazing.  My parents always take me here when I'm visiting.  Jeff and Fish always go the extra mile to make sure we are happy.  This  past Friday Jeff made a special dish my mom requested, Lobster Mac and Cheese, and it was absolutely delicious!  They put a lot of effort into creating a diverse bar menu that has something for everyone.  I'd highly recommend Table to anyone.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Very nice caual restaurant . Reminds me of Atrias.   Pros... Great location and view of Cannonsburg lake from their deck . Food and drink selection are outstanding . Clean inside and out with friendly servers . Live entertainment on weekends .  Cons ... Dinner specials were overpriced and salads were not included in the meal .  Sit on the deck if it's available ."}
{"text":"We had eaten here before and liked it, but on this visit the food was not good. I tried both their soups, and they were both sub par. The corn chowder was little more than cream and corn with very little seasoning, and the vegetable soup was bitter from the overcooked green bell pepper and tasted of really old dried oregano...just awful. I had already sent the chowder back, and did not eat this one, so the waitress took it off the bill, which was nice, but I'd rather pay for good quality food than get my lunch comped. The salad was OK, and Doug said his chicken sandwich was fine, but the food here is not great, some of it is downright bad, and nothing impressed us on this visit. I doubt we'll be going back.  Yes, I know, ANOTHER update on this place?!? Well, yes, but we'd heard that there was a new chef, and there must be, because the food is better. We went for lunch, and the menu is much more interesting, with better choices. I had the salmon and poached pear salad, and it was a little boring, but hey, it's a salad. The salmon was cooked to medium as requested, and everything tasted pretty good. Doug had the veggie lasagne and really liked it. They do up eggplant in the parmigian style, and he thought that was fun and tasty. So I'll keep going back and trying more of the menu."}
{"text":"I was under the impression this restaurant was called Table Lakeside but this is the only listing on Yelp and the address is the same.  Indeed, there is a lake.  The only way people are going to find out about this restaurant is by word of mouth or advertising because you are totally never going to stumble upon it. ... Well, maybe if you live in Canonsburg you would but I live in Shadyside.  We held my mother's funeral luncheon and I cannot express enough how nice and kind the staff were to us.  It's difficult to plan any kind of luncheon, but my mother's funeral was on New Years Eve and we were worried about finding an available space.  Many restaurants were available but wanted us out of there by 2pm so they could prepare for their NYE celebrations.  When they found out this was a funeral lunch, the staff at Table told us not to worry about anything.  They were really, really, really nice and helpful during a really difficult time when it was hard to plan anything and we cannot express our appreciation enough.  THE FOOD WAS EXCELLENT!  I personally sampled their mac n' cheese (really, really good!), had a bite of the hamburger (great), the chicken piccatta w/ veggie risotto (delicious!), the penne pasta w/ fennel and sausage (yum),  The eggplant lasagna has changed my life.  It was that good.  I know it's just not natural to reminisce about the time spent with a pasta dish but go ahead and judge me because I am not ashamed.  You need to try this.  The restaurant is beautiful and the bill did not make me want to weep.  I recommend this restaurant and look forward to coming here in warmer weather because it must be lovely on the lake in nice weather!  (ps, yes, I did do exactly what it sounds like i did:  at the funeral lunch I did actually go and sit next to various relatives under the pretense of talking to them so I could sample their dishes.  But also because I wanted to talk to them.  A little.)"}
{"text":"Guinness was good when it finally arrived. Salsa and chips were like tomatoes and chips - salsa had absolutely no flavor. Overpriced wine. Bottle was supposed to be $31 showed up in the bill as $51. \"King\" filet mignon was small and cooked incorrectly. App (lawn boy flat bread) was good. Overall, our party of 12 was disappointed after investing 2.5 hours here. Waiter pleasant but slow.  Waited too long for drinks each time we reordered. We wanted to like Table but doubt we'll return."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Table last night! It's tucked away a few seconds off of 19 so you feel slightly excluded in a good way. The restaurant itself is HUGE and I would love to go back during the summer when there is actual lakeside/outdoor seating. Must be gorgeous. The service was awesome and if you \"check in\" on your smartphone you get free truffle fries - which were fantastic. We will def be back, new go to place."}
{"text":"Great view and deck in warm weather. Waitress was very friendly and quickly took order but the kitchen took forever, not sure why because it was not crowded.  Then waitress disappeared and could not get check at end of meal.  Has variety of flatbreads, sandwiches and dinner meals.  Carry good meats form parma sausage for the italian sandwich.  Pasta was nice but not inspiring."}
{"text":"forgetTABLE   (I was in the mood for a noodle bowl or pho type dinner, but was in the minority, so maybe I was pouting a little...)   Walk-in party of 3, Friday evening 7PM; seated at an oversized table for 6. weird.   I saw many patrons with fancy martini-type drinks, but ordered a boring chardonnay because I didn't think they had a drink menu. Was never offered one, altho later we saw one on a different table. Have to say the wine pour was very generous. If the liquor pour is similar, I guess I'm fortunate that I just ordered the wine ;P  My dinner was a 1/2 salad and bowl of cream of mushroom soup. Spinach salad with deep fried goat cheese patties (2), red onion, pancetta crisp and walnut vinaigrette. Ask for your dressing on the side. Other than over-dressing, it was a nice salad.   Soup tasted canned, a few fresh mushrooms tossed in. blech"}
{"text":"Waste of time and money. After arriving in town to visit family we headed to \"table\" for dinner. I ordered a burger medium well with pepper jack cheese. It arrived well done without cheese.  We had other issues with the 2 of the 4 meals ordered. The waitress was not listening and failed to correctly order one of the fish entrees. 12 bucks for an over cooked burger with a burned slice of cheese was a bit much. Sadly we ended up ordering pizza once we got back to the hotel.  Pretentious, eclectic and disjointed menu coupled with an overpriced and underwhelming food and service.  Enter at your own risk....."}
{"text":"I have been to Table a few times.  It's always very nice and cozy.  In the summer it's really pretty when they open the doors and you overlook the lake.  Outdoor seating is also very nice.  I love their brick oven flatbreads and their appitizers are really great.  I have gotten a few of their pasta dishes and they were just ok.  Their pork chank is delish!  I think the food is good, but the service can be a little slow and not so friendly.  It is a cool spot to go to b/c its set back away from the road and it's not a typical chain."}
