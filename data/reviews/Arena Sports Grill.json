{"text":"Entered the \"sports bar\" at noon today to catch some NCAA basketball tournament games. They were playing country music. I am not sure what they were thinking and I didn't wait around to find out. TV's don't make a sports bar, maybe they should take the word \"Sport\" out of their name?"}
{"text":"This is one of my preferred sports bar hangouts during football season.  Always great service, and good food.  I enjoy the fact the feature a new beer on tap each month."}
{"text":"Cool little sports bar. It's never really busy, but never empty.. kinda weird. They have great specials including a beer of the month- 2.50 a pint. This month (August) is Sierra Nevada. 

The food is surprisingly good. They have the 2nd best wings (oregano's being #1) and good deep dish pizza too. I was very surprised. 

Ambiance sucks tho. Don't expect too much.  It embraces the look of a dive bar and kind of depressing setting. 

I still give it 5 stars cause it's a fun place to hang out with friends.

-S."}
{"text":"Great sports bar!  The place is huge and can be a little loud.  There are TV's everywhere you look so there is no bad seat in the house.  The service is incredible and the food is amazingly great!  They have a thin crust pizza with a sauce that tastes just like Lou Malnati's in Chicago.  Try the vodka pasta too.  Never had a bad meal here.  Ask for Lori - best server EVER!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times over the last few years. Has kind of a Midwest feel to it. Good food. Good beer selection. Some really cute girls behind the bar. 
Very casual and unpretentious. Somewhat rare for scottsdale. 
Great for Sunday NFL.  
GREAT neighborhood joint. 
I'll be back."}
{"text":"Checked this place out today for lunch as a possible spot to watch NFL games. Took advantage of their lunch menu and got the sliders. I get my bill and $2.50 is added to my bill for a beverage.  I was drinking water. Apparently, you have to buy a drink to take advantage of the lunch specials. I was not informed of this and was pissed. On top of that the sliders were mediocre at best.  These specials that have these restrictions drive me crazy. A heads from the bartender about the beverage deal would have been nice. When I questioned the bill, the original bartender who took my drink order said, \"she didn't tell you?\" I'm not going back to this place."}
{"text":"Local dive bar that we didn't eat at. We were sent here by some neighbors as it was supposedly better than the 2 we mentioned to them. Small seating area, large bar area. Immediate turn-off was the 1/2 dozen kids running around and screaming, and playing Golden Tee. Just had a shot and a beer, and really wanted to leave because of the kids. Sure it was around 7 on a Saturday, but still......Don't like kids in a bar at all. 
I guess the kick was when we got our check. 1 large KiltLifter and 2 shots of Fireball, almost $20. Seemed very high for the type of place it was considering it's definitely a few $ cheaper at our closer local spots. These are prices I'd expect from from a more trendy sports bar with a nicer feel."}
{"text":"Went here for the Friday Fish Fry. Pretty dang amazing fish for a good price. We ate our fill and felt like we got a great deal. Only downside is that it feels like you have to wait too long between \"all you can eat\" replenishment of the fish. 
I have brought my parents here several times when they are in town. We all really like this place and will continue to eat there!"}
{"text":"I've visited Arena multiple times and each time I've received excellent quality of food, service, and drinks.  

The food is awesome (try the Mexican pizza)!   The staff always has a smile on their face, is attentive, and efficient.  The bar selection and drink specials keep me coming back.  Definitely a great place to relax and have some drinks with friends!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here twice ... both times with a restaurant.com coupon  that we didn't actually pay for.  

As a Guinness fan, I was very happy to find they have it!  

The first time we came here we had the boneless wings, a quesadilla with steak and another item that I've since forgotten. The boneless wings were pretty good in their own right but didn't really make us think of wings.  They were more like chicken nuggets albeit a class above fast food.  I personally didn't like the flavor of the steak in my quesadilla but I did like the cheese and the crispiness of the tortilla.  I would order a cheese quesadilla in the future.  

The restaurant.com deal we had was for $25 and we needed to spend $50+.  After the food and two beers each we were still only at $40 something so we also had JÃ¤germeister shots which put us over our minimum.  I thought their pour was very generous for the shots.

We just returned from our second time here.  This time we had the regular wings.  They have a mild and extreme sauce.  We asked if they could do something in the medium range and they were able to accommodate us.  We chose the blue cheese over the ranch option for sauce. We were happy with our wings.  They had a spicy tangy flavor without being too hot.  

We shared the Big Boy burger (Just like Bob used to make only better! One patty
and our secret sauce).  We chose the double patty option and added cheddar. We also had the seasoned fries and onion rings.  The onion rings were pretty good. The fries were a bit bland so I asked for more of the blue cheese as I despise catsup.  That helped a lot.  The burger was tasty and it actually reminded me of a Bob's Big Boy even though it's been many years since I've had one.

When I was in Bisbee a couple of weeks ago we met a couple who were drinking Moscow Mules which I've never even heard of.  Arena serves a Moscow Mule in a copper cup so I had to try it. It's pretty good. I can see it as more of a summer drink in the desert.

This is a couple miles from my house so we'll be putting this into our walking rotation (we like to walk to restaurants that are within 2-3 miles of the house)."}
{"text":"I have been going to arena for at least 2 years now. It has always been delicious and the service is absolutely fantastic. They are the nicest people ever. The food is bar food, but definitely a wide range and good. I recommend the nachos, they are always piled high and every other dish that I have gotten are always great proportions. Definitely the best neighborhood bar!"}
{"text":"Its a great place hands down best pizza in az great great atmosphere Off Track Betting  bar and pool tables definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place !! It is like Cheers in my backyard! The staff is the selling point for me. Of course, the food and drink is excellent, but the staff  is what REALLY makes this place, and is what keeps me coming back for more. Joella (I hope I'm spelling it right!), the bartender is a true testament to what makes a PERFECT bartender, server, etc. I have been there more than a handful of times and Joella ALWAYS remembers my drink of choice EVERY time I am there (Other establishments, Take note!). She always makes you feel right at home whenever you are there. In a business where they see hundreds of people every day, it is so nice to finally find a place where the employees actually take the time to get to know you as an individual, and not just another nameless face in the crowd. 5 stars all the WAY."}
{"text":"There are better bars close by. I went to catch up with a friend and to have a few drinks.
Food was disgusting (we took our waitresses suggestion) 
Service was ok (until we spoke up of our dislike of the food)
We ordered the spinach dip and we got a lukewarm bowl of white velveta with bits of \"spinach\" (could easily have been dried parsley due to texture and taste). Our drinks were brought to the table where 1/2 of them were spilled out onto the table (the napkins consumed as much alcohol as I did). Needless to say I will not be returning anytime, ever."}
{"text":"Cool little neighborhood bar. I go once or twice a month for the food. Wings and burgers are very good and service is always nice and prompt. Specials during the week and beer of the month help keep it a good value."}
{"text":"Off track betting in a neighborhood bar!  Great happy hour deals and friendly staff.  Bathroom was dirty and small. But no real complaints."}
{"text":"I've been going to arena sports grill for years and have never been disappointed with the food nor service. Great sports bar and place to hang out to watch some Sunday night football."}
{"text":"Fun local bar. Fish Fry Night is brag worthy!! Very good food & service on fish fry nights.  The rest is typical bar: average customer service, average tasting bar food, LOUD with lots of sports fans. Pool and music playing adding to the television noise and sports fans. So when I say loud I mean you are competing to get heard if you have a conversation with your friends. I like this place over all just not enough to go there often."}
{"text":"I have been in the neighborhood for a little over 2 years. The food has always been the same sort of bar food and recently they remodeled and changed the menu up a bit. The additions are great, (anti pasta and spinach dip) however they took away some of our favorites. (Like pretzel bites) Happy hour is great pricing for drinks. Reverse late night even better. They also have trivia which is fun several nights a week. (Pool tables, all that fun stuff) The remodel really opened things up, but there are a few new servers and there seems to always be one night bartender who seems less than pleased to be there since I've been going. Some have been there for well over ten years and give the best service. They smile, remember you and what you like. Always friendly. I highly suggest it for watching a game, or grabbing lunch. Michelle is the week day bartender and I've never met anyone nicer! They have a taco Tuesday which has great fish tacos and chili rellenos ! They have off track betting too which is a really fun add - most sports bars do not have!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and everyone is friendly, it is a great enviornment for all. Food is good and the pool tables are some of the best bar tables ive seen. Come in sometime and try out some of the great weekly specials they offer."}
{"text":"Crap food for an expensive meal. The only good this is the fries. Those are actually good. THAT IS THE ONLY THING. The service is sub par. Waitresses don't come over to see us often. Nice pool tables. Food is sub-sub-sub par. Everything is frozen. For the price I could go for a restaurant that is rated at least a 4-5 on yelp. Don't go to this place. You aren't missing that much. 


UPDATE- 
Service is still bad, but more of there items on the menu are better. I guess the 6 items I got for the first 6 times I went there were the only bad things on the menu. I kept going because of a friend who wanted to make me like it. The arena has a lot of work to do, But I believe that 2 stars was wrong. But 3 is cutting it close."}
{"text":"All Vikings' fans unite...the Arena Sports Grill puts out the welcome mat on NFL Sunday's. We get priority seating in front of the best big screen. The servers are prompt, courteous and drop dead gorgeous. GREAT bar, FUN people, the \"make your own\" Bloody Mary bar...sensational...Pizza, Wings, Burgers...this place has it all !"}
{"text":"Very excited to have revisited this place after so many years.  The service is excellent. Lori's service and the intensely awesome french fries (I have a weakness for the perfect fry) brought me back. The constant smiles and generosity from Michelle and Michelle (bartenders) will also bring me back.  Thank you Arena, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had not been to this bar in over a year.  Used to go every week for the fish fry until they remodeled and changed their menu.  Went back last week with my family.  Again, found the same issues as I had before.  Ordered baked fish, waitress came back and said they were out of coleslaw and she offered more fries, tomatoes. I asked for a salad, she said it would be an extra charge - hello, you did have a side of coleslaw so you cannot make an exception.  Finally got our fish (baked).  I asked for more since it was all you can eat and my fist piece was quite small.  She came back and told us they were out of baked and Cajun.  I asked for fried and she was hesitant since they do not cross refill their all you can eat fish, so if you order fried and they run out you cannot have another selection, wow seems odd to me. On a Friday at 7pm when you have an all you can eat special I would not expect you to be out of fish.  I guess it will be another year before I go back and drop $50 bucks on dinner."}
{"text":"Went here using the 50% off coupon in the SavvyShopper flier. Good thing too, because I would have felt completely ripped off had I paid the menu prices.

The 'chicken wings' are simply unbreaded chicken meat nuggets in buffalo sauce. That's not a chicken wing. They were a little tough.

The Black n Blue burger was a bit dry and nothing special about the meat. It sure didn't look like 1/3 lb either.

The service was competent and yes we did tip the waitress appropriately, including a tip for the discounted part of the bill.

The only good thing I can say (other than the 50% off) is that it reminded me that it's time to go back to Havana Cafe again; it's right next door.

I would not go back here."}
{"text":"We've gone here for a number of years and we enjoyed the laid back atmosphere.  Wouldn't have called it a dive bar, 3 steps above that. 

We saw that there had been a remodel and since we hadn't been able to go for a while we wanted to see the new digs. 
Very modern and a design/atmosphere to get you in, eat, and out.  No pool tables anymore, only a couple of poker tables now. 

We were greeted fairly quickly by the bartender who took our drink order.  Our server came shortly wth our drinks. 

We took a little bit to look at the menu and commented on the increase in price. When the server came back we asked a couple of questions and decided on the 'nachos'.  The server told us it wasn't the typical mound and we went with it anyway.  Our server was very nice, but had no help.  No one who would deliver drinks or run the food.  Not good training on how the staff should work together, and have the ability to see when someone needs any extra hand. 

The order was put in at 6:40 and we still hadn't gotten our food at 7. We were able to finally flag down the server who told us she thought our food was ready.   We had waited so long we we told her we wanted to take it home.  Waited another 10 min and the girl who takes care of the poker tables brought it out to us. 

Another table had sat down 5 mins or so after we ordered and when we were leaving they were finally getting their order taken.  Had taken at least 15 min for them to get their drink order taken. 

We live 5 miles away.  We pull out the food and it was cold.  Not lukewarm, cold.  It'd had been sitting for almost the whole time we had been waiting.

The picture is the 'nachos'.  Really just a cheese crisp with a nacho label.  And for $12.49 (We got beef on half for an extra$3.50 and you can see, not kuch meat for the price).  Overpriced appetizers for the amount of food received. 

We had liked going here before the remodel - decent bar food, enough to take home and a good price.  Not anymore.  We won't be returning and can't really recommend going here."}
{"text":"Came in with my boyfriend at about 2pm on Sunday. It's a seat yourself kind of place so we didn't expect service right away, which is okay because we called in advance to have a game put on for us which is the main reason we stopped by. Although, we didn't get greeted for at least 15 minutes and finally when we did, our server Judi was completely rude. We had to ask for a food menu, and when we asked if we can get the wings half and half flavors she replied with \"um. That's why we have half pounds\" all rude! Offer a suggestion like getting them naked with the sauces on the side! You really don't have to be so rude. She was also complaining about how busy it was. Like I get it, I'm a server, but you should be happy you're getting any business at all with your attitude. So after we ordered our wings all one flavor so it would be easier for everyone, we waited a whole period plus intermission (total of about 35 minutes) FOR WINGS. Not okay. We are definitely never coming back to this place and advise you not to either."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here because it's close to home, not because of the food. Entirely hit or miss. However, the drinks are priced in nicely and the staff is competent. Seriously a neighborhood joint only...do not go out of your way, especially ifnyou find yourself closer to a zipps or blue 32, or even buffalo wild wings, or........."}
{"text":"Met there with our friends at 2pm on a Sunday.  Place was empty.  Waitress was not familiar with the day shift.  Manager was rude. Before we could order food, my wife spilled her coffee (purchased from Dutch Bros next door) the manager told us to leave.  Went somewhere else to eat.  They lost out on a $70 sale on dead Sunday.  Place was dirty.  Don't give your business to this dive.  The owners must have issues."}
{"text":"I could not believe how rude the bartender was to me. I'm 22 years old and go to bars and clubs all the time and never have an isssue and she made me sign some strange contract to prove that I was over 21 and then asked me so rude if I had been drinking which I hadn't been and I said no and she said well your eyes look extremely tired and im like we'll I have no idea ? And it gave me the worst vibe and left after I finished my drink. Wouldn't recommend coming here if you are 21-24 I guess"}
{"text":"So disappointed. I used to eat here regularly 10-15 years ago. They had great wings and burgers. In fact I never had a bad meal here back in the day. The Friday fish fry was one of the best in the area.  Unfortunately, a lot has changed. The fried fish can now go down as the worst I've ever had. It was like rubber and very dry. Hard to cut with a fork. Not the great flaky cod that they used to serve. Everything was completely flavorless. I really can't say anything good about the food. Everyone in our party was disappointed with their meals. It wasn't anything close to decent. Sadly I will never go back. Used to be a great place. It's too bad it has gone so far downhill."}
{"text":"Wow, what a joke this place turnout to be.  First, it was not busy. Waited 20 minutes to have the waitress (Judy) shows up with no menu's.  She brought 1 menu for a table of 4. Burgers were way over cooked.  Waited 20 minutes for the bill as waitress watched TV.

I will never return."}
{"text":"So I went here recently  to meet up with friends to grab a bite to eat. Not only was their patio  extremely dirty but  the inside of the restaurant had this stench when you walked in.  It is definitely a cheap sports bar. My boyfriend had a burger with fries and I had the chop salad. The burger was supposed to be cooked to a medium and it came out well done, we asked the server if they could remake it and she just gave us this look and rolled her eyes. It took about 20-25 minutes for the new burger. The French fries were obviously frozen, they had no flavor and were chewy. My chop salad on the other hand had barely any salad at all and was completely covered with slimey turkey lunch meat. After we had returned the burger I had hoped to catch the sever to tell her about the salad, but she didn't even acknowledge us until 20 minutes later when the new burger came out and my salad that I only took a bite of was mush. At that point we asked to get the food taken off . We still paid for our drinks and tipped the server well, but the manager never came by once to apologize about the food. After we left we went to 5guys to get some REAL burgers and fries."}
{"text":"This is another great little sports bar where you can feel very comfortable taking your kids. I always hesitate about \"bar\" restaurants, they are a risk for bad language and bad behavior, but NOT this place, they are awesome!

Menu is very diverse from Mexican to Italian, from wings (really good too) to a fantastic beef dip! The girls that wait on you are attentive, beautiful and very good at what they do.... Go and enjoy....."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in years so boy was I surprised with the remodel. Place is amazing and opened up with a nice patio. Met my sister here for football and a beer 3 weeks ago and the family and I have been back 3 times since. Honey bbq wings \"smoked\" were amazing. I love a crispy wing!  Burgers have been great with thumbs up from whole family. Off track as well, we will be back frequently!!"}
{"text":"The remodel is very nice! Can't wait for football season again. We had the Vodka Pasta, it was a bit cold but would have been better if it was hot. The pizza was awesome!  I will post pics."}
{"text":"Like the sister store, Upper Crust Pizza, the wings are VERY good.  Very neighborhoody feel - a bit mroe downscale than what you'd expect 1 mile from Scottsdale Road in north Scottsdale... but if you can get over the ambiance, the wings were very good, among the best I've seen in Phoenix.  It feels like the old pizza and wing bars back in Buffalo NY!"}
{"text":"Arena gets the job done when you need some bar food and a drink. It's certainly nothing fancy. It's split into 2 parts. It's just a very large room with somewhat of a warehouse feel. The main section has a bunch of low tables, a few high tops, and a bar to the left side. I'm not sure what it is about the layout of this place that confuses me. Picture a school cafeteria. Lots of tables set up in rows. Good for groups because pushing them together is a cinch considering you are basically in the lap of the table next to you anyhow. If you need to get up to use the restroom, it feels like you end up rubbing your ass on the head of the person behind you trying to squeeze by. The side area has some booths and more cramped seating and seems more \"family appropriate\". 
They do show music videos, which is pretty awesome considering some of the tunes people choose. Some real old school gems are thrown in that provide some entertainment. They also have darts and a Big Buck Hunter. TVs are scattered about. 
The menu is big and diverse. Typical bar food (wings, burgers, sandwiches, salads) even pasta as well as Mexican food. Something for everyone! Service is friendly and fast. I usually have Lori, who is terrific. 
I would up the rating if it wasn't such an odd seating arrangement. I'm not in middle school anymore and prefer to keep those days behind me. 
*Happy hour has some good drink specials. 
*The water tastes like dirt from a pond, so spring for a bottle if you are in the need for some re-hydration. 
*There is no patio or outside seating here."}
{"text":"The food here was not worth the wait, the pizza was soggy and underdone, without much flavor.  It took a very long time to get our food, the service focus seemed to be at the bar.  I would suggest coming here if you want to drink, but not for the restaurant aspect."}
{"text":"Taco tuesday is quite the deal at this local sports bar. I never expect much when things are on special, but Arena delivered three chicken tacos (loaded with meat and cheese, lettuce and tomato) for $1.25 each. A tasty salsa was also included on the side. They also have huge discounts on chile rellenos and enchilada's (about 2 bucks each) and two 7oz corona's were only $1.50 each. The place was pretty empty at about 9pm, except for a small pool tournament, and the two bartenders were friendly enough to a newcomer. Rest of menu is typical sports bar stuff, but Tuesday is the day to be there.

UPdate: $2.50 chile Relleno looks good, but must be frozen and reheated and is stuffed with ground beef which is just too weird for this item. Pass on them."}
{"text":"Great sports bar with real good food! Just got a face-lift. Clean great service a must try for any one looking for a place to enjoy a game with a Bev and good eats"}
{"text":"A decent neighborhood bar with good food for the price.  They have a great beer selection which gave them an extra star including Guinness which is sometimes hard to find at the neighborhood joints. Service is also very good. Tons of tvs nice patio. Will come back."}
{"text":"I had some vouchers to use at specific establishments and just happened to be by the Arena Sports Bar which was one of the VCA approved restaurants. Going into the meal I knew it would be free so I did not have the highest expectations but used Yelp recommendations for what to order. We ordered two very simple items; the first was a soft pretzel with cheese. The pretzel itself was extremely greasy and left residue all over our hands, and the cheese that was served with it seemed as if it was just thrown in the microwave and taken to the table. In the end we did not even finish it as it was just terrible. We also ordered the boneless wings which were so over done that the chicken was 100% dry on the inside. Once again, my expectations were not high for bar food, but this was by far my worst experience of eating at a sports bar. 

To top things off when finishing the beer we ordered we were surprised to see a layer of black goo at the bottom of the glass. All in all it was a terrible experience and I would steer clear of this establishment even if you have the opportunity to eat there for free. 

The service also left much to be desired and from the get go it seemed as if the waitress took issue with the fact that we were using these vouchers as those who had used them before us had been 'difficult.'"}
{"text":"Just moved to the Scottsdale area from Las Vegas and this reminded me of my favorite local sports bar back home.

Atmosphere:  Definitely geared towards locals which is great. There is an area to just dine in as well as the bar plus patio.  The bar area was great nice size bar to sit around with pool tables and nice mix of music.  Plenty of tvs to watch any sporting event you might want.

Bartenders /Waitress:  This was the best part of my experience everyone was incredibly attentive and so friendly.  Great senses of humor, welcoming, and top notch service. It was easily the best bar experience I've had since moving here.

Food/drink:  Food was great and prices were reasonable especially on a Saturday off happy hour.  

Without a doubt this will be my go to spot in the Scottsdale area from this point forward.  Can't wait till i can stop by for a happy hour.  You are missing out if you do not hit this place up."}
{"text":"Sat down and waited 10 minutes for somebody to wait on me.  I watched multiple servers stand in the corner and stare at us but nobody bothered to greet us."}
{"text":"Inside is nice since the remodel and food is descent nothing too exciting to write about"}
{"text":"Frustrating with take out order of Strawberry Spinach salad.  Plenty of spinach and got the grilled chicken breast too - yummy.  Had maybe 6 strawberry slices in it with very little feta and they didn't give the large iced tea I paid for when my daughter picked up the order to bring to me at work.  The service when eating in the establishment is much better than take out.  Totally not a reflection of the establishment but the staff taking care of the order."}
{"text":"The remodel was needed and certainly a success.  Other yelpers are right, there are a few more nails to hammer and hinges to hang but it's looking good so far.  Better than all of that is the new menu with plenty of the specialties still available.  The arena was and still is a great neighborhood bar.  With staff like Michelle still behind the bar the arena is a special place."}
{"text":"We were visiting in Phoenix this past weekend and needed somewhere to go watch our football team play.  We asked at the hotel after finding it on Yelp and they said it's a good time.  We didn't want anything fancy just a simple sports bar to eat, drink and watch all the games.  That's exactly what we got and it was awesome.  Beer was good, food was good, the Honey BBQ wings were excellent!"}
{"text":"I've experienced better, but for an outta-way bar it's okay, I would return. 

Now this place is Half restaurant, Half OTB (off track betting salon) with quite a few local families for dinner, and a few die-hard track betting happening at the bar on the farside.

Now, I'm a bar rat. I enjoy sitting at the bar talking with the staff and meeting the regulars, (but I may of hit an off night) and I like to have dinner at the bar if I can. I am comfortable here, but they have too many bar stools crammed together to maneuver on and off (in and out).

The evening I was here they had a trashcan fire out on the front stoop, possibly from the many discarded losing bet tickets thrown about, but mostly just from a careless smoker.

Our two bartenders weren't on the same page, I ordered a round of drinks and the next round was a completely different price. Wasn't pleased, and in asking was kinda frown down upon, enough that it was time to leave and try friendlier joints."}
{"text":"Great local sports hangout! For a sports bar, I give Arena 4 stars; as a restaurant it would be 3 stars. So I went there as a group of 6 to watch NHL playoffs. For some reason I thought this was a newer place, but turns out it's a rather old local neighborhood hangout, and features an OTB. The bar/otb section was pretty dark and very loud (it was Thursday night), so we opted for the dining room. Our server was VERY friendly and accommodating - she got us a big table, and switched the TV to the Blues-Wild game for us - which is why we were there. As far as a place to watch the game, the dining room was just ok - decent view of tv, but no sound at all. The atmosphere in that room was more for dinner than watching a sports game, but since its a sports bar we didn't feel awkward cheering for our team out loud. The OTB half of the place is much better suited to games etc, but on that night we wanted a little peace to be able to focus on the game.
We ended up ordering a few beers, potato skins, a hamburger, 1lb of wings in secret sauce, and 2 large pepperoni pizzas. My friend had the burger and said it was good; I was able to try everything else. Gotta say, the potato skins may be the best I have EVER had. They were nice and crispy all around, and covered in lots of bacon - most places barely put a few bacon bits and serve the skins rather mushy, but not Arena. Their skins were AMAZING. I would definitely order them again. The wings were decent - typical sportsbar chicken wings; about 10 pieces made up a 1lb order. They were nice and crispy and the \"secret sauce\" was actually really good - not too spicy or sweet, just perfectly balanced. The pizza was good too, but my main gripe was the use of cornmeal on the bottom. I HATE it when pizzerias use cornmeal - that is pizza blasphemy! most places do it just so the pizza comes out of the oven easier - that is just lazy pizza skills. I've never thought that cornmeal adds a good taste to pizza, and it makes it messy. Without the cornmeal, I'd say the pizza was a good thin crust foldable NY style.... but as is, the pizza is average and just a hair above mediocre, because of the cornmeal. uggh. 
So, for a sports bar where one would go to watch games like NHL playoffs, or bet on horses, or play bar trivia with the DJ - Arena is a good local hangout, nothing special, but effectively fulfills expectations (which should never be too high with sports bars). With lots of TVs, and games like billiards and darts etc... Arena is a fun place where you can go with friends or even just go alone if you're bored at home. It's pretty divey, but has a local neighborhood vibe that keeps it friendly. The food is not the best, but a cut-above-average for a bar - the potato skins are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, and the wings and pizza are recommended, but with reservations. The service was excellent, and the prices were quite reasonable for the location and type of venue. You need a place to go and watch the game and devour some food? Arena is probably a very good bet - not fancy or gourmet, but local and friendly."}
{"text":"This  place USED to be a favorite of mine.
IDK what happened but it really went down hill. I've been in twice in the last 30 days and both meals were not up to standard. I probably won't  be back for the food.
I enjoy the OTB and the booze is still wet... so they have that going for them. I'll  just grab something to eat before l come down for poker..."}
{"text":"Fried fish to perfection.  Tender, seasoned well, yummy.  French fries were good, Cole slaw was amazing. Wish it was Friday to have more."}
{"text":"I moved to North Scottsdale a little over a year ago and have been in search of a local bar, I finally found this place on Yelp probably 2 or 3 weeks earlier. I had been meaning to come in and check it out. Went in on a Sunday evening and I asked my waitress what she recommends eating since it's my first time in the establishment. She recommended I get the chili relleno, which was amazing. Then we went back on the following Tuesday, sat at the same table and got the same waitress who was awesome, she remembered the drinks we ordered from Sunday night and was kind and wrote down the daily specials for us. We went back last Sunday but earlier in the day and again had another great waitress, the waitress who normally helps us came in and had lunch with her family before starting her shift and she came to chat with us for a few minutes. I'm sad I didn't find Arena Sports Grill sooner, it's a great local area bar and on nights we just want to go out and grab a cocktail or beer we stop by."}
{"text":"Went in with my girlfriend for food and drinks.  Big bar and plenty of room for dining as well.  There was a jukebox and pool tables as well as off track betting which seemed cool if you're into that sort of thing. The staff were very welcoming and friendly.  We just moved to town and the staff made us feel like we were at home.  We were looking for a friendly neighborhood bar and that's exactly what we got!  Drinks were pretty reasonably priced and the chicken Philly that I ordered blew my mind. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Average food. The waitress was pretty rude and gave us problems with the Groupon we had."}
{"text":"I came here back in April.  I had the stuffed mushrooms which were delicious.  I hadn't been in here in couple of years.  The renovation looks very nice.  Cold beer, good food, and great company!"}
{"text":"I only come to arena for these people.... Veronica, Avasa, Lori, Mom Michelle and blonde Michelle Seanothan and Jameson #beststaffever ever"}
{"text":".. horrible service...food sub par...  doubtful to return...waiting at least 1 hour for food...   just pissed...  kitchen needs to get it together..."}
{"text":"Arena is a great place for all ages. The restaurant side accommodates families with children well. The bar side is also nice because there are plenty of tables to sit down and eat. Lots of tv's in the place which is nice for watching sporting events. Service is always excellent and in the 6 years we have been going to Arena, we often see a lot of the same staff still working there and still happy to be there. The queso appetizer is really good and served in a edible chip bowl. My favorite meal is the buffalo chicken pasta. You cant go wrong with adding buffalo chicken and pasta together :) It's not your fancy Scottsdale sports bar, but thats what we like about it. You can come as you are and enjoy good food and great service."}
{"text":"We were there for trivia on Thursday and the overall experience was pretty good. The food was the same bar food you would expect at any local pub, I just got the seasoned fries and the price for the portion was good, their drink prices were also fair.  The reason I am giving it two stars is the service, the servers switch halfway through our time there the first waitress was great. However the second waitress not so much. My total bill was around $9 for the fries and a drink, this bar is  a $10 minimum for credit cards. So I paid the bill with $10 cash and the waitress never asked if she should bring it back she just kept the change, which actually cost her and her coworker a tip, had she brought it back i would have added to it to make it the standard 20%. I just thought it was very rude to not return it without asking and if this is standard practice i'm sure she is costing herself and coworkers tips."}
{"text":"Love coming to this bar as it is in my neighborhood and the employees are amazing. Love taking advantage of their happy hour drinks; they offer them from 2-7pm I believe. I'm always greeted with smiles and friendly conversation. Avasa, Ronni and Maryclare are usually bartending or working when I go in and always recommends the best food and drink combinations. 
Highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard issue sports bar. The place is pretty large and spread out which is nice, but we went late on a weeknight and there weren't too many people around. Seems like the kind of place a locals have been going to for years. Little dark, a little divey but not dirty or unpleasant. Beer selection wasn't great but the wings made it worth the trip. The wings were great. I live in the area and I imagine I'll be back here sometime soon."}
{"text":"What a great place to dine at. My wife, mother and I have been customers for close to 20 years and we have NEVER been disappointed. Great staff, great food and just a nice place to go for dinner. Thank You"}
{"text":"When I first walked in I thought about walking out, first impression was not the best nor inviting but the food was great. The bartender/server was on point with timing. We didn't have to wait for anything. She could of been a little better with table side manners but she was busy and working both bar and floor. Overall I liked it and will go back!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times after work with colleagues of mine.

Not too shabby. The wait staff if pretty awesome and it's just a great spot to chat and drink and chill.

Prices are cheap so there is no room for complaints."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this bar for years and like the new renovations but unfortunately now that families are in the bar area it's like a freaking Toys R Us. Kinda liked it better when kids stayed on the \"restaurant \" side. Adults drinking and screaming kids doesn't mix."}
{"text":"Closed for unknown period of time. We bought a Groupon thinking this would be a great place to go. NOTHING was said they would be closed for however long its going to take. NOTHING on YELP says they are closed. Even when we called the phone rang and rang with no responses."}
{"text":"This place is a dump!! So dirty and ghetto. The food is disgusting and the server smelled so bad that I couldn't breath ... Ended up leaving without eating and no plans of coming back."}
{"text":"All my friends always talk about this place and finally had a chance to go today for the first time. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad and my friend got a teriyaki chicken burger both meals were excellent especially for the price all the workers there we're very friendly and welcoming my favorite part is you could actually bet on horse races while you're there didn't have any luck I make 40 to 1, 20 to 1, and 12 to 1 to win, but had fun none the less. They have a good selection of drafts in the bar and a separate restaurant side thats more family oriented. I'd recommend this for anyone that wants it good meal for a good price and have some entertainment by betting on long shots 2 win for races. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had great service tonight, ask for Lori. Pizza was very good, didn't know they have reverse happy hour it was nice. Friday nights they have trivia, it was a lot of fun. I can't wait to come watch some more games here."}
{"text":"Great sports bar feel.  Lots of TVs.  If you are looking for a menu of perfect bar food, this is the place.  From Burgers to Pizza and chicken fingers.  And all the fried appetizer favorites.  With the great sports bar feel on one side, they have a family friendly dining room also.  The owners are hands on and greet everyone.

And if watching the game gets boring, they offer off-track betting."}
{"text":"Nice cozy sports bar.  Didn't have the food here, the drinks are very reasonable.  If you like Bass Ale (draft, of course), this is a very nice spot to have it..."}
{"text":"What a great staff and the food is excellent!! Highly recommend to friends and to visitors!!"}
{"text":"I went there today with some coworkers for lunch for the all you can eat fish special that they have on Friday's and it was very much worth it. Upon entering the bar/restaurant the first thing I noticed was how dark it was. The next was how big it was. There are two sides to this place and we opted to go to the side that had more lighting. I mean I don't know about you, but I want to actually be able to see what I am a eating. 

So after being seated and having our drink order taken, it took a minute for someone to actually come and take our order. It was kinda weird as it didn't seem to be that busy but who knows. In the end everyone ordered the fish and we all had it differently. Some had it fried, some had it baked, some had it blackened/cajun and we all either fries or onions rings. Let me just say that it was worth the wait. The fish was so moist and fried perfectly. I had a piece of the cajun as well and it was seasoned just right. Oh and the onion rings? Good lawd they were good. I am not sure what they did back there in the kitchen, but they most definitely made up for our wait. 

The bill came and we were pleasantly surprised. The all you can eat fish special pretty much included the drinks for only .25 cents. Cool huh? So $13 or so dollars per person, plus tip and a VERY full stomach later, we all hobbled out of there and went back to work fat and full. As a matter of fact its 10pm and I am still full from lunch today. Sad but true and I only had one plate of fish!!! The all you can eat fish fry is worth it if you like fish. Be patient because its worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is a dive bar that services a regular clientele. If your not a regular your service will be sub par.

Also. If you don't spend at least 10.00 American dollars you can't use a credit or debit card.....this usually translates that the place isn't doing well financially."}
{"text":"I am most definitely NOT a Sports Bar patron. Would never have entered this restaurant  except that I was here for an event. Dropped in early for an early dinner/late lunch. Not auspicious beginning--barely tasted or felt the effects of run in the rum & diet I ordered. The finish was awesome, however, when I dove into the Steak and Blue salad. OMG. So wonderful!  Fabulous blue cheese dressing, fresh veggies (crisp lettuce, sweet red onion, ripe tomatoes) and the steak was chopped strips clearly marinated in a wonderful sauce with tons of crumbled blue cheese and crisp bacon it was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Just left the Arena Sorts Grill. I give it one star as the service was excellent. Very attentive ladies behind the bar. However, that it where it stops. The food was absolutely awful. The place smelled of bleach from wipng down the bar area and tables,there has to be something different that can be used. The bathrooms are far from what you expect in a North Scottsdale place of business. Like I said, the bartenders did a great job but that is where it stopped. Never again would we go to this place."}
{"text":"Everything is awesome. I've been here quite a few times but this is the first time we were actually eating every time we came here before we had a few drinks watch the games and but I'm a few horses pizza looks delicious we are about to take our first bites munch munch it's good! Windsor awesome Pfizer delicious salad is scrumptious definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Best go-to sports and hang out bar to enjoy with friends. The service is always friendly and helpful.  Try the nachos"}
{"text":"I have been going to Arena for years the food has always been great as the service. On my last visit 05/20 I was so hungry and couldn't wait to eat some wings.  I was greater by a blonde waitress and I took a seat.  I literally sat there for 20+ minutes and this girl walked past me like I was invisible. I was so hungry I became light headed and had to leave. It has to be pretty bad for me to leave hungry.

I went to 4 peaks and was promptly greated and seated.  Waitress immediately greated me and took my order.  That's the service I used to get at Arena.

Edit***

Manager reached out offered gift card and apologized.  I never returned for gift card but will go back and hope for great service again."}
{"text":"Great place to watch football! Staff is on the ball at this place. The food is good and they have drink specials night of the week. I think I found my new place to watch Monday Night Football!"}
{"text":"Yuck. Please avoid. Waitress was super nice and meant well but that did not make up for the crummy food. My fiancÃ© decided to take me here- I guess I should not let him pick the restaurants haha. We ordered Long Island iced teas and they were tasty but weak. He ordered a burger with bacon and it was awful. Soggy and over cooked beef. Like a freaking tire. He asked for no onions and of course it came coated in onions. He ate less than half before deciding it was time to stop. I ordered the chicken enchilada. It came with rice and beans straight from a can. They were inedible. The chicken tasted like that crummy canned chicken you get in the large cans at a Costco. Flavorless. I really hope I don't get food poisoning. The place was cheap but we feel like we totally wasted our money. Do not go here. Go to Chilis. Seriously. This might be a fine place to drink and watch some sports but if you're looking for edible food go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great bar! Bartenders are awesome, cheap drinks, great happy hour, off track betting is fun too. Small smoking patio which is also a bonus! Great place to go have some drinks with friends and hang out!"}
{"text":"The antipasto salad was terrible. My wings were dry and had hardly any sauce on them. I used to love coming here years ago but I won't be back anymore. I'm really disappointed with the food for how much money I spent"}
{"text":"Like the set up in the bar love the off-track betting looks a lot nicer from the inside than outside great service great food reasonably priced drinks would come back again and again and again"}
{"text":"Went in here a couple days ago and I must say it was pretty busy for summer time. And happy hour was good! Salads and appetizers were perfect. Only thing that bugged us was the bartenders were kind of snobby and didn't seem like they wanted to be there. Otherwise worth checking out."}
{"text":"Extra stars for the super cute and cool bartender Michelle!!  The drinks are priced right and the food is about average.  Good solid neighborhood bar!! There is a goofy chick named Mary that hangs there sometimes, she livens the place up too!!  Oh, of track betting is fun, that is if you know how!!

Every once in a great while all expectations are blown out the door!!!  Steve.....you sure do know how to make a few beers a good time!! Thanks for being awesome!!"}
{"text":"It Keeps getting better!

I have been going here for many years , was never really the best spot , however, cheap drinks, low key and good location.But things are changing in the best way.

Eats- Worlds best BLT! .Its pretty standard but for some reason the way it tastes is great, loaded with bacon on toasted bread, super fresh crispy lettuce. noms. I am a big fan of the Asian chicken salad and brownie for dessert.

Drinks- Great happy hour prices,( pretty cheap even when its not), plus no matter what you drink or whatever flavor you like , I can bet they have it! I swear they have every flavor or vodka known to man! OJ and marshmallow vodka , YES PLEASE!

Redo- Looks like they just remodeled , it used to be kinda dark but it seems quite a bit brighter and cleaner and more spacious, a much needed change. I think its now a place where me and my ladies will be going much more often. Especially with $4 dollar drink specials at night. Free wi-fi is a huge plus!!

Staff- a little life and personality is behind the bar now! fresh friendly faces with drinks being made quick and with a smile. They do offer OTB, which has a friendly and helpful staff and is happy to show you how to bet for all the rookies out there.

A happy little corner bar that is so much more! Cant wait to go back..More than likely tonight, see you there!"}
{"text":"Love this sports bar. Great indoor and outdoor seating, plenty of tv's to watch your favorite sports team. Has pool tables, OTB, trivia night, etc. best pizza in town, especially on Wednesday nights - $10 pizzas! 
Ask to be seated in Lori's section, she is a great personable waitress does a fantastic job!  Other waitresses the park right but she is our favorite! She knows us when we come in and always remembers our usual.
Huskers n Arizona watch site!"}
{"text":"It's official -- Arena is no longer a Husker bar. Sad. It seems Management just doesn't care.  And why in the hell do you play music at halftime??? It's a sports bar!!  We (along with almost everyone else) left."}
{"text":"A hot go-to spot to chill, have a drink and the best steak and cheese in Scottsdale. Get it toasted.

The waitresses are all great too. 

It's a dive but a fun, clean dive with consistently great bar food and staff.

I've been going since I bought a home in Scottsdale 13 years ago, at least once a month."}
{"text":"Never again... I brought my boys to catch some games and have some wings and burgers.  The evening started badly, and ended worse.  Although there were only four or five table filled, It took at least 10 minutes for a waitress to show up - no menus in hand - to see if we wanted a drink.  We asked for menus, which took another five minutes.  I prompted, on behalf of my 7 year old, \"do you have a kids menu?\".  Of course they do, but it doesn't occur to her to bring one?  She brings the drinks, we order wings to start... 20 minutes later she comes back with the wings, never bothering in the meantime to come back fro the rest of the order.  The wings are OK, but not worth coming back for.  The burgers, on the other hand, were quite simply the worst I've ever had.  My teenagers (who eat everything!) couldn't get through more than half without feeling like they were going to get sick.  The only upside was that we used a restaurant.com discount, so at least we didn't pay full price for an awful experience.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"The Arena is a great place to go and watch football. Go there on Sunday's to watch football. All the games are being shown and all tv's are marked with which game is going to be shown. Food is always good especially the wings and the Philly cheese. If you are lucky, Michelle will wait on you. She always does an awesome job."}
{"text":"This is the most unprofessional business I've ever seen. I wouldn't recommend any work there my daughter did and she had to fight to get paid."}
{"text":"Although I was a bit weary going inside, I was actually impressed by the size of the place, the service great and my chicken cheesesteak sandwich was really good, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Save yourself the hassle and go somewhere else. Husband and I went there with a \"Groupon\" type certificate. Our waitress was very friendly and took good care of us. The food was just okay. The atmosphere was the worst of it. Maybe it was the OTB, maybe it was just the worn, dark look of the place...not sure, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"One of the great spots in Scottsdale/N. Phoenix to watch a sports event.  The staff is quick and friendly which keeps things moving along.  I go there to watch all of the Football games.  If you're into Fantasy sports, this is the place to go in Scottsdale.  The food is OK.  I stick to the basics and survive but anything creative seems to fall flat.  The burgers and potato skins are my favorites."}
{"text":"Food was below average and the service was slow. Also the bartenders were in a foul mood for some reason."}
{"text":"Post remodel. They did a good job although I kind of miss the old place. The menu seems smaller now. Food not quite as good as it was a couple years ago. Still a great place for beers and football. I'll be back."}
{"text":"my daughters went there to get pizza ordered food then got attitude because they where paying separate and then would accept credit card for order under 10 dollars \"it was 9 something \" bartender was totally rude , funny thing is im in the same plaza and i wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy ... totally rude like we are waisting there time"}
{"text":"Went on Sunday to watch Week 1 of the '09 NFL season, and was pleasantly surprised. I used a coupon from www.Restaurant.com, and saved  $10 off my $25 check. (bevs not included)

The food was good to excellent. Wings were fantastic, big and meaty, with great sauce, and were only about $6 and change for a dozen. The nachos were a giant pile of goodies, and could barely get through half of it. I didn't have any alcohol, as I had my 3 yr old with me, but I did feel totally comfortable with him there  -  great family atmosphere even though it was croweded. Everyone was good little boys and girls, and very friendly crowd.

There are plenty of tvs surrounding both dining rooms, and there are plenty of teams represented, it's not one of those bars devoted to just one team. Again...friendly banter between different teams followers, no yelling, screaming, fighting or even arguing. Heck, I'm a Ravens fan and even chatted it up with (gasp!) a Pittsburgh fan! What's next, dogs and cats, sleeping together??

Good service, lots of waitresses flying around, and everyone seemed to be having a blast cheering on their teams."}
{"text":"Everything was extremely delicious The Waitresses are is very friendly. Fun atmosphere the  only thing I can say bad is that I wish I knew about this place a lot sooner"}
{"text":"Stoped into this spot because it was on our way home, and one of the only places open. Wasn't sure what to expect. The food was pretty good, I got some wings, which were bomb, and some 1.50 tacos, but they were a bit underwhelming. Oh well, they were only 1.50, what else could i expect? The service and drinks were even better!!! Our bartender,a hot blondie, Micky was super fun and makes a killer gummi bear shot, I'll deff be going back!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports. What is really nice is the ability to hear the game you want at your table via an app. This place has gone a long way after their big remodel. Trivia here is great on Friday nights!"}
{"text":"DO NOT get the fish! We tried to visit a new fish shop near our home first, but it was \"out of fish\" per their hand-scribbled sign on the door - having always wanted to visit Arena we popped by, and when the menu \"highly recommended\" the fish plate I was thrilled - that was short lived though - when fish was served I realized that I had made a huge mistake. This looks like it might be fun for a burger, football game or late night of abusive drinking. Arena, you get one more try!"}
{"text":"Went in for chicken fingers at lunch. Did not even look at the menu. I remembered them being expensive. Like nine bucks?. But they are good... and they were. Service of food was slow. The food was great. Thick cut fries. Everything was hot. Served with Buffalo sauce and ketchup.... Bill comes... $12. For me, this is expensive for chicken fingers, anywhere. But I thought I was in a sports bar. If you don't care about the check. Stop in. Good bar food. Good service. If you are looking for chicken fingers. Go to culvers. Better chicken fingers. Save three dollars. Drive-through. No tip. Again, service was good. But money is money for lunch."}
{"text":"Use to like it until my songs kept getting skipped because they weren't \"family appropriate\". It was Metallica around 7pm on a Saturday. The manager refused to refund me my money"}
{"text":"Fun local bar and grill. 2 Pool tables, off track betting, darts, beer, nice staff. (They have a var side and resturant side)I have sat in Lori 's section on the bar side for years and she greets you like a long list friend, remembers your drink and keeps them coming. Fave foods....irish nachos, fish sandwich, wings, and the cheesesteak. It's drinking food, but they always have options for the calorie conscious."}
{"text":"Great for watching sports!  Mass televisions and great bar food!   Staff super friendly and great service!"}
{"text":"Great food and weekly specials! Come here more than twice a week. Great bar to watch sports at too."}
{"text":"Updating to 4 stars.  They've renovated the interior and it's now very open, clean, and just improved. I had their burger and steak fries for lunch, and it was excellent.  The waitress/bartender Michelle was awesome, very friendly and attentive.  I think the only thing I miss is they did away with the booths so you're stuck picking from a sea of tables.  Definitely a good experience though and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Cheap bar to watch Thursday night football.  The only bad thing about this place was a long strand of hair in the fries.  Freakin nasty."}
{"text":"Yikes. We went here to specifically watch a college football game because they host our team. Well, the service and food at Arena played as poorly as my good ol' alma mater! Now I know why we have relocated to Whiskey Row and other places. The wings, which are supposed to be a specialty, were so overcooked and tough we couldn't really eat them. We ordered more, but never got them. The fries were ice cold and soggy. The service was awful and they actually charge a $1 for tomato juice to put in beer. Each time! If you are getting ready to try Arena for the first time, skip it. If you are a regular or one who used to go \"in the good old days\", times they have a-changed... Boo Arena team!"}
{"text":"Went in the afternoon wanting to relax and enjoy a couple drinks with my S/O. Ending up leaving after one round due to the service by the bartender/manager on duty. She was very rude, rolling her eyes as I asked her simple questions about the menu. When I complained, she was very stand-offish and not willing to correct the issue. She did apologize after we had left the restaurant and called back to explain what was wrong. Overall very bad customer service that ended up turning a nice afternoon sit down into a 10 minute trip"}
