{"text":"We were staying at the hotel across the parking lot from  Brewster's. The hotel clerk said guests at the hotel would receive 10% off the bill at Brewster's, so we decided to try it. I had a group of 9 for dinner  on a Tuesday evening around 8 pm. The dining room was nearly empty. I thought the kitchen would be able focus on our order and everything would be delicious. Not so.... Three of the five burger entrees were way over cooked. All the fries were lukewarm at best and undercooked, like they were leftover from the dinner rush.  The two salad entrees were decent. The server took the cost of the three burger entrees off our bill but said no 10% since they already took the dinners off the bill. Disappointing... Not planning to return. As the old saying goes \"you get 1 chance to make a good first impression.\""}
{"text":"Had dinner last night with my girl friends and I can easily say one of my WORST experiences!!  *1/2 hour to get drinks *It was a particular bad experience for one of us. She got her salad when the rest of us were getting our meal and she got her meal when we were getting our to go boxes!! *it was cold...air blowing down and on our feet. Many people at the tables around us had their winter coats on. When we asked to have the air turned down the reply was, the people over there are hot! We told her cold air was blowing on our feet...she said, no it's not the air blows out from above. I asked if she was the manager, she said no...I'm the OWNER!! Unbelievable...the OWNER IS ARGUING WITH THE CUSTOMER!!!!! *Lastly-when my friend did not receive her meal I requested to speak to the \"OWNER\". SHE NEVER CAME BACK TO THE TABLE!! Pathetic...hiding from your customer!"}
{"text":"DO NOT go here! I found I piece of wood in my wrap. The waitress was apologize, got the owner who accused me of putting it there! I took two bits of the wrap. I said I would not be back and he showed no concern! I paid for my wrap just to show him I was not trying to get a free meal . Eat anywhere else in twinsburg but this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"On a Sunday night  at 6 PM (July 2015) we ordered an appetizer and two entrees. 35 min later they still hadn't brought out the appetizer and had no estimate on the main dishes.    The restaurant was less than half full with plenty of wait staff. Our guess is that the management can't keep the kitchen staffed on a Sunday and hopes patrons won't mind a longer wait.  We minded and we left.  Any restaurant that can't put an appetizer on the table in 15 minutes, after the drink order is delivered, is a business that may be going out of business."}
{"text":"Since moving here we have eaten here several times.  As our family visits we always take them here for dinner.  We have always had excellent service and excellent food.  The prices are so reasonable too! The flat bread is one of my favorites now and the mussels appetizer is my husband favorite."}
{"text":"Three of us dined this past Sat ( 4/19 )  not crowded but a private party was arriving as we were leaving and the band was just setting up - good variety of foods - my \"chopped\" salad was very good - fresh ingredients - although not a true chopped salad - more of a deconstructed chef salad, I ordered the small and took half home it was large enough to be a meal on its own.   I also had the shrimp wrap - one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten - absolutely will become my go to meal there - again ingredients fresh - just the right amount of heat - chipotle aoli - the other two had burgers that were cooked as ordered - love that they will \"cook\" a rare burger.  Portions were large and the service was great, friendly but not hovering"}
{"text":"Service was great. Our waitress was friendly and checked on us often. We had risotto balls which were ok but not a lot flavor. For my entree I had a turkey burger which again didn't have much flavor.  Overall it was ok but probably won't go back."}
{"text":"When I visit Twinsburg, I love coming here. It's in a strip mall, so the parking fills up fast. The food is amazing for a very reasonable price. I've had several items off the menu. There is definitely something for everyone. You have to try their Flatbread pizzas...awesomeness all the way around. They also have tvs for your enjoyment. It's a little dark in there and can be really cold, but the staff is very attentive and kind."}
{"text":"We were there last night met our friends at their recommendation. We had drinks very good and the flat bread pizza also very good we will be back to explore other menu items"}
{"text":"Staff was pleasant.  Service is OK to good.  Food is way above par for a bar...But no knockouts in my book.  Good, lively, atmosphere.  It's a nice casual dining place that I would visit again sometime ... if it's in the established flight path."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night. We sat in the bar section which is slightly segregated from the dining room with a half wall. I actually enjoyed the segregation because there was live music taking place in the dining room area. I personally am not a fan of live music, but if you enjoy that, you might like sitting in the dining room. Also, the bar area is extremely dim so it was a little hard to see the menus. The dining room has a lot more windows surrounding it so the light seemed to show through more in that section. The group I was with are big bourbon drinkers and this place has a great selection of bourbon. We always feel like we struggle to find bars with decent bourbon these days, but Brewster's had multiple options for us. The bartender seemed extremely knowledgeable on all the different brands of bourbon as well and so he was able to point us towards a brand we have never tried - and it was a great new find for us! We ordered a couple appetizers to split between us: stuffed mushrooms, sausage flatbread, and fried mozzarella. Every single item was delicious. It tastes and looks a step up from your normal bar food of burgers and fries. Although I didn't order an entree, if I was to take a guess based on their appetizers, their entrees would be pretty amazing."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would. I Came in and sat down for the longest time and was never acknowledged. I had to call a waiter over to ask if I could at least get some drinks. I called him a total of 3 times! He just kept walking past and finally on the third time he looked at me outside the corner of his eyes and said in a snarky attitude that he'll be over in a minute. When he finally comes over I ask if they're still serving food and he just throws his hands up with an attitude and says no they're done for the night. I didn't even bother ordering anything because it felt like my very presence was so bothersome for the waiter! If you ever happen to still come here at least avoid the waiter/bartender with the bald head and goatee"}
{"text":"I am so confused why this place has 3 stars!  It is one of my favorite restaurants!  I love how them menu changes from time-to-time.  I like to try new things, but my all-time favorites are the TKO Burger (with cheddar instead of bleu cheese) and the Southwest Chicken Wrap.  I can't get enough of that chipotle aioli!  I would order anything on the menu that has this sauce on it.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"Service was slow forgot our starter. Had to ask for drinks. Food was barely warm first and last will eat there."}
{"text":"I was hoping the third time was the charm, but alas, it was the last nail in the coffin.   I came in for lunch determined to give this place one more shot after two disappointing visits, because I support the local company that owns it, it's very convenient to my home office, and they make an absolutely killer lobster bisque.   What I realized is that unlike many restaurants that have the exact opposite problem, Brewster's is excellent on execution but simply awful at conceptualizing dishes. This time I paired my standby bisque with a grilled cheese sandwich with grilled Granny Smith apples, bacon, and a fancy cheese (perhaps gruyere?). Sounds great, right? Each one of these elements was better than average individually, but taken together the sandwich was simply an unappetizing mess. Like their \"signature\" wing sauce, it was a clash of flavors that simply did not go together. Understand, it was cooked perfectly! It just tasted like someone had accidentally mixed two recipes together and decided to run with it anyway.   To make matters worse, this time the usually excellent lobster bisque was topped by lump lobster meat that was ice-cold. Not the most appetizing thing in a hot soup. As much as I would like to return to Brewster's, I think this visit sealed the deal for me. I won't be back unless I have a real hankering for that bisque. It's the only thing I can remotely trust."}
{"text":"Really pleasantly surprised with the Southwest Chicken Wrap.  Looking forward to going back and trying something else."}
{"text":"Nicely decorated and airy restaurant. Casual, but with table cloths.  The menu is pretty extensive with a mix of burgers, pasta, dinners,  and seafood. I ordered the \" Holy Rigatoni Batman\". Many of the items have corny catchy names. You can either have fun with it, or feel a little weird saying it. My dish was rigatoni pasta with sauce and shrimp and mussels. I expected an Alfredo type sauce, but it was more towards the tangy side. It was okay, but not something it'd order again.  Service was excellent. I would recommend the place, just not the menu item I chose."}
{"text":"Meal was very good and drink selection makes trying new drinks easy. Bar food is a little better than expected, and the atmosphere was relaxed but quite. Guessing it picks up later in the day but it was pretty slow around 4:30."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying our services was great. I can't remember her name, but she does her job well. I tried the chicken n waffle cone. I posted a pic because the presentation was perfect, but they need to work on flavors unfortunately. The chicken was pounded thin and breaded. It was over cooked and very salty. The bourbon maple glaze I really just didn't care for. The mashed potatoes needed the salt that was on the chicken, and the waffle cone added nothing to the meal. Had the cone been sweeter, that may have brought the dish together more. All in all it was fine, but I wouldn't order it again. Rick said he's burger was fine and he liked he's boneless wings. 3 stars for an average meal."}
{"text":"I visited Brewster's for lunch. The waitstaff was very friendly and accommodating. Based on other reviews I tried the Lobster Bisque and it was delicious. I also ordered the Iceland Wedge which was good and  enough for two. I will be back to try dinner entrees."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland on business and was staying across the street from \"Brewsters\". I sat in the bar area...it seemed as though it was an effort for the bartender ( with a bad sun parlor burn) to come over to the table. I ordered a Kettle One up, which is my favorite. When I tasted it I was very surprised  to have the overpowereing taste of a \"dirty\" martini. When I asked the bartender about it, and if she kept the blue cheese olives in olive juice she confirmed that they did. From that point I was treated as though I didn't know what I was talking about...she seemed very defensive and insecure.   I ordered a kind of large ravioli with lobster and lobster sauce..very yummy! It also came with some steak tips. They were a little chewy, and way too many. The Chef delivered my food to the table, and asked if I wanted some steak sauce, and I answered \"no thanks\". He retorted that of course I wouldn't want to ruin the steak with anything but the seasoning...and he was right....but I got the feeling that the bartender had spoken to him about the martini thing.  I left the bartender a very good tip, because everybody has a bad day. But, in retrospect ( having once been a bartender) she didn't make me feel very welcome.  I go to Cleveland from time to time, but I don't think I'll be returning to Brewsters."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and sweet. The food was pretty good. the boneless wings w/ the Asian Ginger sauce were delicious and lightly breaded - the best boneless wings I've ever had, no doubt.   i got the Hoss Cartwright burger which was also really good but i wasn't able to finish it for some reason.   the service was good. the restaurant looks nice and they had a band playing outside on the patio.   they really need to do something about their sign up on the building though. the logo is awful and looks like the kind of sign you'd see at a roadside bar.  https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/R_pYnzgCJF4RT-6oyt6eHg/o.jpg  i imagine I'd go back just for those wings if we lived closer."}
{"text":"They make a really good burger. Bit pricey but very good. Have had a decent meal every time I've been here. Band is loud. Place gets crowded. So be aware."}
{"text":"You always feel at home at Brewster's even if you are not from Twinsburg. It is a restaurant/bar. The deck/side patio is wonderful. The have a fire burning on nice nights. On the other side of the patio is a fireplace. They have a backroom for large parties. We celebrated my husband's birthday here last year and the service and owner were amazing! We had about 30 people and separate checks....server's nightmare.   I have used them for catering at the Cleveland Clinic and they always make for a great presentation and tasty lunches.   The bar is average but has not only your standard bar stools and high tops but a couch and set of chairs to relax. I love this place for that reason....you feel at home.   They are Browns Backers for GB3.   Try their flat-breads you will not be disappointed. I try a new one every time we go. The GB3 burger-Sharp cheddar cheese and a lot of smoked  bacon with sautéed onions. GB3 style usually 5 bucks on game days.   Crabby Patties are another must try. You can even have this for a light meal or app.  Two huge crab cakes sitting on a bed of field greens and served with a side of chipotle romulade.   They have lives bands often and open jam night on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Went in there's for a late lunch at 2:30. There were 3 tables on the patio including us. We sat there 15 mins and got up and left with no sign of a server or anyone to greet us. Too bad. Was our first time and the menu looked delicious."}
{"text":"Good place.  Food is good, great beer list.  Large bourbon list but they need to put prices on it..... Loved the outdoor porch to eat except people were smoking 1 table next to my 3 kids......really! If not for the smokers I would give them 4 stars."}
{"text":"Had the worse experience this evening. Place was not overly crowded. Food was great as always.  Service was horrible!!  Hubby had to go to the bar himself to get a refill on drinks, since server was nowhere to be found. People seated after us had their food before us still waiting on appetizers. After we paid our tab sought out manager only to find her seated on outside patio enjoying music and a drink. Not apologetic about service or seemingly concerned.  Only apology came from the person running the food. Waitress halfheartedly apologized when the check was left."}
{"text":"Nice place, was just driving thru, never been to a brewsters. Had the hamburger wrap from a yelp recommendation and it's was very good."}
{"text":"The food never disappoints and always very friendly service! Great outdoor patio space although they used to have awesome canopy with comfy furniture. Not sure if it was a victim of wind.  Will come again for sure.  Great draft selection too"}
{"text":"Pretty good for bar food. We live in Twinsburg have tried just about every restaurant around. This is still one of my favorites. I do love the mussels and the dish called old man and the sea which is fish and shrimp breaded and fried is pretty darn good. Not too greasy. Service has always been good and the prices reasonable. They have live music on the weekends too. Great outdoor patio like we ever get to use that here in Cleveland! But seriously, I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Breaks my heart.... but no more!  week after week this winter the Friday night band has been allowed to play ear splitting music with no concern for sober customers or staff.  We have asked... we have begged... nothing can be done about the volume??  I feel bad for the wait staff that is out of voice by 8 pm from screaming... the search for a place that cares about the volume is on."}
{"text":"Was in today for lunch around 1pm. Our waiter Aaron was very nice and efficient at first. I ordered the Italian Panini with no pepper rings. When my sandwich came out it was on crumbly white sandwich bread instead of the ciabatta listed and all the veggies (onion,lettuce,tomato,etc) were nowhere to be found. I had meat and cheese on gross bread. When I asked out waiter if they could add veggies he took my plate back into the kitchen with a bit of a huff and returned with two tomato slices on it, from the very top of a tomato with some of the stem still attached. I never send food back and was a little taken back and upset, especially since this was supposedly an $11 sandwich. Another person I was dining with asked our waiter for lettuce and onion on the side for me since it was pretty much unanimous that if they took my plate back again it would be spit on. He was given a single leaf of lettuce and unevenly cut onions. Made the sandwich slightly more palatable but I've had ten times better Italian sandwiches at Subway which is just sad. Everyone else liked their meal but the atmosphere was ruined by my sandwich."}
{"text":"Dined here recently with work colleagues for lunch. Great location right off I-480 and SR 91. They've turned this location into a white linen tablecloth place from a sports bar motif, but the sports bar atmosphere still lingers in a good way. I had the fried Haddock special and it was lights out good. Fresh Haddock, light but crispy breading, fries, awesome hush puppies and a side of coleslaw for $15. You could easily split this offering for two.  Other orders at the table included a southwest chicken wrap, lobster bisque, house salads, and a Cajun shrimp creation. Everyone enjoyed their food.  The service was attentive and well intentioned, but.... Do not stand at the head of the table and hand dishes to be passed along to your guests. And the same rule applies when taking away dishes. Serve Left, Take away Right. SLTR please."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood so we go to Brewster's quite a bit. Brewster's has a great beer selection and they have my favorite beer on tap: Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale. Recently they changed their menu and had a slight price increase and I believe they are a bit overpriced now. 17 dollars for a fish a chips dinner is a little much. The service has also been a challenge lately. We went here last night and it took 15 minutes to get a drink and there were multiple mistakes on our meal. I'm not sure if they are just hiring new people or if they're trying to change their image, but it's hurting them. Overall this place is average with average food that tastes good, but is overpriced. I would also add that when we sit in the bar it is 5 star service, it's the restaurant that needs help"}
{"text":"Not the best draft beer selection, but the patio comfort and the amazing food surely made up for it. Mussels were delicious, and finally a restaurant that knows how to make Risotto. Dinner was so good that I'm craving it for breakfast. Service was excellent and our server was hilarious. Great vibe for a white tablecloth restaurant without the \"stuffiness\" you typically experience. Had a great time!! Kudos on having two lounge chairs amongst the patio setup"}
{"text":"OMG, my hubs will NOT stop asking to go here!! He's my oldest (and occasionally most whiny) child. :) I know this place has been here for a number of years, but we just discovered it this fall.  You MUST try the poutine- topped with gravy, melty cheese curds, brisket, and scallions. Amazing!!!   The menu is pretty extensive, and we have liked everything that we've ordered so far...which is a pretty big selection, since we've been there about a billion times since we found it...  If you're headed there on a Friday or Saturday night, call for reservations."}
{"text":"Vastly improved in the last few months. The lobster bisque is awesome and the menu has made huge strides. Still a little pricey but good food and the service is better."}
{"text":"This place sucks drove here and there closed for a private party guess they donot like people from the street when u close like this ur  stuck up so why just go private all the time what a waste of time so donot go here they might be closed for a private party"}
{"text":"A nice, classy bar and restaurant. Comfortable, decent food & drinks.  Pros: Had a perfect rootbeer float martini. A little expensive ($8.50) but it was delicious. Why aren't there more adult drinks with rootbeer? Had rootbeer-bbq sauce pork shanks that were meltingly tender. Very reasonable price for a huge portion. Calamari with rings only! No freaky mini-squids. Amish Warrier (brat) has a delicious pretzel bun. So good! Nice atmosphere, lots of warm wood seats, moveable tables, flat screen tv's, a bar and restaurant area,  saturday night had a guitarist playing covers. Nice selection of foodie dishes and standard favorites (my mom and I could both eat here!) Patio looks nice, can't wait to come back in summer Lots of other really exciting and interesting looking menu items that I want to try next time (Sweet potato gnocchi, tots, lobster ravioli, etc etc)  Cons: Sauce selection for the calamari a bit lacking and weirdly presented Server was a bit distracted (forgot salad, was not always available when we needed something) Fries a bit underdone Pretty loud at times, acoustics need some work Martini's very expensive (and prices are not listed on the menu)  Overall I am looking forward to another trip. This place is very easy to find in Twinsburg, off 91 right before you get to 480. It just opened and expanded and I can only think it will get better with time."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a patio with a fire, great pizza, good food and service to top it off was great. Thanks for holding the rain off Ohio. We have had a great trip. The patio is dog friendly also."}
{"text":"Great place!  Never disappointed in the food.  I have had many items off of the menu.  They have a lot of offerings from appetizers to main courses.  Something for everyone.  Good beer selection.  About 10 or so taps.  It is a little dark and food can come out a bit slow at times. That doesn't bother me as you know what you are getting is quality."}
{"text":"The patio is spacious and nice around 6pm. Very good service. Very good food. No complaints. Sofie Draft beer is a must have. I would have no problem recommending to a friend."}
{"text":"This is a TGI Friday's type restaurant with a broad choice of selections.  Food is good, but not great and is totally expected.  Prices are medium, but fair and service was friendly and efficient.  This is a place for regular visits, casual and not time consuming."}
{"text":"Expensive and not worth the money. Bar staff argued with several customers regarding what glass the customer wanted the beer in. If a customer asks their beer be poured in a regular glass and not what appears to be a brandy snifter, then that should be done."}
{"text":"I ate there last evening with my collage age son. The minute we arrived the young girls working as hostesses, I assume, seemed very pissed off to actually have to work. My son said there are two of us and then they kind of smirked at us and finally seated us. At that point I got a very bad vibe. Then our waitress came and she was very stuck up and snobby as well. The food is just ok. Very overpriced. The only good thing I can say for this place is the food came out very quickly and it looks very nice inside. It could be a very nice restaurant if they treated their customers with respect. I would not recommend this place for a relaxing evening. Very disappointing as I live in TWINSBURG and there are very little choices to dine."}
{"text":"Not bad food. My wife and I had a chicken dinners which were OK. My son had the mac and cheese bake with chicken and blue cheese. That was awesome!! Otherwise it was just OK to me."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with a nice beer selection. Always been there at lunch time and always have had a really good meal. Friendly service. Definately recommend it! Nice outside patio."}
{"text":"Surf & Tips are fantastic.  Owners are great people and very freindly."}
{"text":"I stopped in just for a quick snack.  I ordered the large version of the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes.  Let me say first the only thing jumbo about them was the amount of salt in each of the 2 (large portion) crab cakes.  I then tried the lobster bisque, have no idea where the lobster was.    Not planning on returning to this establishment.  Too many other choices out there to pick from."}
{"text":"Not sure I get the negative comments about Brewsters. Staff was friendly and attentive and the food was great."}
{"text":"2/16/18 Overall disappointing, especially since first visit was outstanding. Think I ordered a gourmet mac and cheese that time. Service was ridiculously slow! Love bourbon menu. Must have 75 options. Many varieties of scotch, too. Caesar salad average at best. No anchovies. Impossible Burger (Plant proteins, fat from coconut oil, and heme which is an ingredient found in all living things, that gives meet its flavor. We get our plant-based heme from fermentation. The impossible burger contains no animal products). Amazing that it is plant based and tastes so much like a moist burger. Order with rye bread, which adds a lot of flavor to the sandwich. Good, not great, compared to actual burgers. Featured on Fox 8 news. Sweet potato tater tots good, not great. Margarita flatbread not bad, but a bit boring. Live music every Friday. Good blues band that plays quietly enough to talk."}
{"text":"Love it!  We have been here for many meetings and for dinner! Moderate prices. Good drinks! Great service!"}
{"text":"Ended up here for a Happy Hour!! Let's keep this short and sweet, since happy hours are too. Food: good. Get the flat bread! Drink: strong. One martini and I had to practically be carried out! Verdict: would and will return."}
{"text":"a really friendly vibe. great food close to all the hotels.  I will go back. Nuff said.  M"}
{"text":"Traveling for business and was searching for a place to have a bite and watch the Cavs game. Found this gem on yelp and I am so glad that I did.   Service is awesome - I called ahead asking if I can be seated near a TV in the restaurant section; luckily, there were many TVs with the game on. The hostess/server helped me pick a table with the a good view. Overall, she was delightful. So sweet and friendly.  Food was good! The sweet potato fries were delicious! Best I've ever had. They had just the right amount of crisp and sweetness to them. I got the Chicken portobello wrap. My server said that's one of her favorites. Food came out quickly and was delicious; I just wish there was a little less cheese (I'm not a cheese person though, so that's why)  Place as a whole is simple and clean. Overall, I would come back here."}
{"text":"We love coming here!  The service is always super friendly and prompt! The bartenders make great drinks! Any dinner we have had is excellent! The patio is also awesome! We look forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"I went here to watch a college football game on a Saturday afternoon. It's a nice calm pub that you can enjoy watching some games at. If your looking for somewhere classier than BW3s then this is your place."}
{"text":"I'm not really a salad guy but the iceberg wedge is dynamite.  Great beer selection and prompt service.  Price is agreeable with what you get.  Great place to get your dinner and done suds in Twinsburg."}
{"text":"Flatbreads are delicious!  Nice service staff and good for casual dining."}
{"text":"Is it a sports pub? Is it an upper class diner? Kinda of suffering from an identity crisis. Food is ok"}
{"text":"Brewster's is good!   As everyone has said, the Lobster Bisque is to die for! It is soooo good! I've had it twice. The first time it was more chunky with lobster meat and a little less rich than the second time. So the first time was definitely better.  I've also had some sort of Wedge with southwest chicken or something to that effect ... I don't recommend it. Since it was advertised as a wedge I assumed the lettuce would not be cut, but it was. And the flavor on the chicken was nothing special. The Glenwillow chicken port. wrap wasn't very good either - but I got it to go so there's always a difference in taste.   The service has always been friendly and attentive but I do think it is a little bit pricey for what they offer. Oh, well. I'll keep going back. Especially for the Lobster Bisque!   Oh, and I'm pretty sure they have music on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! The burger I had was juicy and full of flavor. My wife got the cheese steak flat bread and that was amazing too this will be our new favorite place we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have only been here twice in two years, and both times have been for a GB3 Brown's Backer's of Twinsburg tailgate for the first game of the year. While the games themselves are always disappointing, the staff and restaurant were very accomodating and offered great service. The cooks of the group roast a whole pig and mix up the sauces in the back. It's served up buffett style on the side, which I assume is usually used for more tables. We did order several appetizers which were all fantastic. Wings, artichoke and spinach dip, and a mountain of chips covered in cheese and chicken. Love it. The server was always ready to bring drinks around right when you just finished your current one. I'm guessing I'll be back here again next year to watch the Brown's lose another game!"}
{"text":"A nice find when in the Twinsburg area.  We wanted more than pub food and were extremely pleased with the broader selection.  All our food was served hot and relatively quickly.  We were extremely pleased with all that we ordered from soups to main courses.  Our server was professional and did a great job without being intrusive to our conversation.  I would certainly return when back in the area."}
{"text":"I have been to Brewsters many times going back to before they relocated to the current location. The food was always pretty good with many original takes on a classic New American menu. It is definitely better than your average bar food and a bit classier with table cloths and cloth napkins. In the past the letdown was always the service. Well, I can say after more than a half dozen visits in the past few months that the service has been very good every time. They must have discovered that was a problem and addressed it. If you have been scared away by the slow service in the past, you should give them another try. The food is some of the best in town and a good alternative to Panini's across the street when you want a better grade of menu options."}
{"text":"Perfectly fine menu options with a better atmosphere, and probably gets the 4th star for being the only place like this in Twinsburg.  Brewsters is probably not as good as you're hoping for, but it's better than a lot of places.  I've eaten wings and burgers and sandwiches and flatbreads and Mac & Cheese.  They were all perfectly \"fine\", as another reviewer had mentioned.  The flatbreads are solid, and they are huuuuge, as in like pizza size. The servers have always been attentive, as have the bartenders.  The outside patio was recently upgraded and enlarged, but I haven't had the pleasure of eating out there.   The real plus is the bar area and beer selection.  Prices are where you'd expect and the atmosphere is upscale and relaxed.  I don't believe there are any specials to write home about or anything that really makes me crave this place, but it's a nice fall back for those in Twinsburg."}
{"text":"I had the fish and chips plus the lobster bisque.  The bisque was a much larger serving than usual, and it's very thick and rich. I could only eat half. My wife said the leftovers, reheated later, we're still good. Personally, I'd prefer something not as overwhelming.  I got the larger size of the fish, which was a mistake. I'd asked first, and the server described it only as two pieces of fish, four shrimp and some fries. He didn't mention that each piece of fish was bigger than the plate.  The breeding to flesh ratio for the fish was high. As a result, the taste of the fish was masked. Ditto for the shrimp. I wish restaurants wouldn't butterfly their fried shrimp. It should offer some resistance to the tooth and a satisfying snap. Flattened, there's no snap and the flavor doesn't get released.  Overall, I got the impression of a family restaurant that had higher aspirations but couldn't meet them. Not a bad choice for the neighborhood, though."}
{"text":"A coworker told me about this place so I checked it out on yelp. I basically ordered what everyone recommended.  The lobster bisque for starters. It was very flavorful but I'd like my bisque to be hot not lukewarm bordering on room temperature.   For my entree I ordered The Great Bacon Browns Backer, medium well. First of all my burger wasn't hot it was dry and overcooked. I barely had any sharp cheese and \"a lot of smoked bacon with sauteed onions\" as advertised. The bacon that was on my burger was greasy, soggy and was just unappealing. There was a minimum amount of burnt aka sauteed onions.   The only saving grace of this meal was the piping hot sweet potato tots and the Great Lakes Christmas Ale. I'd give this place 1 more chance because my coworkers gave it high marks.   Personally I think they are trying too much because they market this place as a cafe bistro pub- just pick one and do it well.   The atmosphere is good there is a bar area with some couches to lounge. Tables outside for smokers in the front by the entrance and a patio area for warmer times. Another plus is they have live music during the week."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Brewster's fairly regularly for the past couple years. The food has always been top notch, whether it be lunch or dinner fare!  The poutine fries are incredible!  The wings are crispy and meaty. I think I've tried just about every appetizer and have never been disappointed. (Standouts for me are the bacon-wrapped filet tips, the poutine fries, the stuffed Hungarian peppers, the Sammie fries, and the sausage stuffed mushrooms) I think I've tried just about every flatbread too!  The \"surf's up\", margherita, Hungarian hottie, and The Greek are my favorites. The do a nice caprese salad, and for an entree I always seem to gravitate toward the Chicken Mac & Bleu!  Soooooo good but soooooo bad for my waistline!  I tried a burger there for the first time last week. I opted to go with the The Greater Bacon Browns Backer. It was cooked perfectly to my liking, with a ton of bacon and cheesy goodness, and the caramelized onions were a sweet touch!  The sweet potato tots that came with were delightful!    I love to go here in the summer to enjoy the patio and the occasional live music. Be forewarned, if there's live music INSIDE you'll probably not have good conversation with your dining party. It gets pretty loud in there. There are times on the weekend that we've opted not to dine there for that reason alone. Don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking off any stars because of it, it just depends on my mood, the size of our party, or what kind of experience in looking for on any particular night. (Do we want to chat & catch up with each other or do we want to just eat and listen to music?) I want to add that while I've occasionally experienced slow service, I've never experienced bad or rude service. Everyone has been warm, welcoming, and seem genuinely interested that we enjoy our time there.  Brewster's holds a top spot in my rotation of regular haunts!"}
