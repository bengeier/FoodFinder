{"text":"I think this place is great all around. I like the location in north Olmsted better because it's bigger and there's a more attentive larger staff as well. But who can argue with 2 dollar drinks and decent service. Beer cheese soup AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"For a bar, they have great food! Drinks are cheap and good happy hour deals. When pregnant, I could not get enough of their fried pickles! I only gave three stars due to service. After a few visits we are still disappointed about the lack of intentionality in the employees. We will go back, but under the assumption there will not be spectacular service."}
{"text":"Great bartenders. Decent food. My burger was so salty I couldn't eat it. Fries are good. Cheap drinks."}
{"text":"Food was ok at best. Beer selection is good, if you can actually get a beer. Service is terrible. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Keeping this short. I get the mac and cheese for $2. It's awesome. Not sure what the cheese is (smoked gouda?) but it's awesome and the mac and cheese (ziti) is presented upright which is kind of cool. Also had the flatbread which is great.   Patio is great in the summer. Would like to see some plants out there when it warms up for ambiance."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  A little (understatement!) noisey.  Friendly staff, good local hangout to get away from the typical mall-chain-crud.  Some of the beer selection is indeed 2 bucks as are a few of the apps.  Great bar food!  Will be back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I had a really good burger, and a couple of drinks, and my bill only came out to $16. So, it's reasonably priced to say the least.  The service when I sat at the bar was excellent, and they had trivia going on the night that I was there. Overall a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"Food was better than I thought it would be and prices for both food and drinks are great.  I've been to this location a couple of times and during the day when it's been not very busy and the service has been sub par, the bartender/server is a bit aloof.  I've been other locations were the service was better so try other ones or go into this one knowing the quality will be in he food and not the service."}
{"text":"Been here lots of times, only disapointed once, bartender was rude.  Really good food."}
{"text":"Nice place... but terrible service. Nice that the bartender is busier bullshitting or giving people water instead of getting a paying customer a beer. Nice place but service sells or makes you never return. No wonder this place is empty."}
{"text":"Picked up lunch from here. I ordered a wrap and onion rings. The onion rings were pretty good, the wrap left much to be desired. Service was just okay, the bartender was great on the phone, not so much in person. The part that really got me is that they charge a \"Carry-out Surcharge\". I have never been charged a fee to pick up food, I find it ridiculous. I won't be eating here again. Nothing they serve is good enough to go back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great food! I had the Cobb salad with steak instead of chicken and it was delicious. Huge portion sizes too!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars on Parma! I go here often with friend to either catch a game or to just hang out. The staff is pretty friendly- I've never had bad service the many times I've gone. The bar tenders are easy to talk to and are decently skilled. Their drink prices cannot be beat! The have many drink selections for $2 (go figure) and even their cocktail socials are around $5. Their food is pretty good too! In my opinion, it is top tier bar food. My friends' and my favorite are the sriracha boneless wings. The interior is nice and clean. They also have a pretty nice patio. I love this place and plan to keep returning!"}
{"text":"Good place to drink beer and eat appetizer type foods.  Nice outdoor area for drinkers.  More geared to customers on a strict budget.  Loud music , average industrial style atmosphere.  Nothing impressed us - it was just ok - kids got sliders which were nothing special and we got the flatbread which was good but small.  Really have no reason to want to go back."}
{"text":"I will never go here again! You get exactly what you pay for plus crappy service. The drinks are miniature and the food is less than mediocre. I ordered calamari. Don't waste your time. It was bland. There was an issue where I ordered from an old printed menu that had cheaper prices on it. When I asked my server, Lacy, to adjust the bill she gave me a nasty attitude. Thankfully the manager, Nicholas, came and adjusted the bill. I came in thinking I was going to get great drinks and food and left never wanting to return."}
{"text":"Great drink prices, good food, has a small patio. Enjoy going here."}
{"text":"Two Bucks has the best Mac and Cheese!! Definitely a must try. Everything on the menu is very affordable no more than $10. Even has s separate $2 food menu. Lots of liquor and beer that's $2. Fireball, Jager, Sailor Jerry.....lots of good stuff."}
{"text":"Bacon grilled cheese sandwich is amazing lol. Comes with bacon (of course), tomato and 2 different types of cheeses on yummy bread. Their Long Islands are also great-and you can't beat the $5 price! Went this afternoon (Monday) before dinner and it wasn't too busy. The bartender (Ariel or Ariela I think was her name) was really friendly and attentive. Too many places I go to don't know how to properly treat their customers, so A+ to her customer service. Thank you and I will be back again :)"}
{"text":"Went here for the first and last time. Ordered macaroni and cheese balls as an appetizer.  These were double breaded with panko and fried.  Could barely bite into them and the interior had absolutely no taste.  Ordered the breakfast burrito with hash browns.  Someone needs to take the salt shaker away from the cook!  Could not eat either the hash browns or burrito as they were so heavily salted.  Only gave these place one star because the waitress was very efficient and nice.  My advice is to find someplace else to eat."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going here. The only thing I don't like is how hard it is to get a drink. Not so much the establiment fault. Its just soooo many people there. Bartenders tend to favor certain customers but they have to make their money so I can't be too upset. Overall..its a great place"}
{"text":"I've been to two bucks only once due to mediocre service. Their food is pretty good. I got their fried pickles which were over battered but they are huge slices which made it juicy and delicious. I had to peel a lot of the breaking off though. My friend got a veggie burger that was very good. Their beer prices are good compared to other establishments near by.  The only thing that doesn't have me coming back is the poor service. Bartenders poured weak shots and drinks and it took forever to get another! Other wait staff cleared our table off regularly though which was pleasant touch. I didn't like the crowd much. A lot of young adults hanging out but what can you expect from a place that offers cheap drinks? I might give this place another chance in the future just for food."}
{"text":"Came on a Thursday (11/3), left satisfied. Mark and Christine were more than generous. Place was super clean, shout out to the bar-back. Any questions? Shoot me a text. 440-409-1363"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and reasonably priced drinks.  Fun for an evening with friends but the food choices get a bit boring if you go there often.  My fall back when the seasonal menu doesn't have something I like is the Chicken Caesar wrap.  I just wish they still had coupons in the Cleveland Around town coupon books that some kids sell through fundraisers.  I bought a couple of books in 2013 for the Two Bucks coupons!"}
{"text":"Bartenders are super welcoming and friendly, drinks & food are great but still inexpensive. Favorite weekend spot for my friends and I for the past few years!"}
{"text":"I was impressed. The food is all made in house and far exceeded my expectations. Prices were very reasonable. Eat here. You will not be sorry. :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I visit two bucks rarely often.  There are some good menu items and cheap drinks. Atmosphere is so so. A little generic. Boneless buffalo wings could use a little improvement. Really really love the cheese curds. They are fresh and hot and perfect. Also the cheesesteak sandwich is also fresh and tasty. Would love to see some Hefeweizen on tap!"}
{"text":"I was in here with a group of friends for our weekly get together, and we had the best time thanks to our bartender Ashley! Hands down best bartender ever! Her food suggestions and shot suggestions were spot on! We've decided to make this our regularly weekly spot now! (Only on an Ashley day though lol)"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I had a great time.  Brought a few new people in today,  decided to sit on patio, along with a few other customers.  Next thing we know there is a rat on the patio being very friendly.  Once we informed the manager he did nothing.  He allowed for 3 tables to walk out and he didn't care.  His response was at least they are outside.  Before leaving I used the restroom which had no soap,  and a toilet clogged that was blocked with a wet floor sign.  When I informed the manager of this he said oh I guess my employees didn't take care of it correct.  We asked him to take care of our 10.00 bill and he said NO you either pay it or we will call the police.  This place is disgusting and the manager or owner whatever he is,  is arrogant and a completely rude.  If you like rats then this is a perfect place for you!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment twice in which both time I have received bad service.   The first time I went, me and my friends seated ourselves... It was late so the kitchen was closed (we ended up getting food from Friday's next door) we ended up ordering drinks. We when first sat at the bar the bartender was rude and took forever getting our drinks so we just paid for one drink and left.  The second time we seat ourselves and the kitchen was still open so we order some food. Everyone raves about the fries but I didn't like them and out server was very friendly but would forget the drinks we ordered and would take forever to get them and would take three times as long if he forgot again. We didn't get our bill until 45 minutes after we asked for it and we contemplated if we should just walk out. Yea the drinks are cheap but so is the service ...."}
{"text":"6:10 entered restaurant and sat ourselves.  6:14 a server finally came to our table. 6:18 our drinks finally showed up. At this point the waiter hovered over us, not speaking, waiting to take our order. We informed him at this point we needed another minute.  6:22 a table came in and sat next to us.  6:25 he comes over to take there drink order, still has not returned to take our food order.  6:27 comes back to bring their drinks, still ignoring us.  6:31 we leave money on the table to cover our tab and leave, still hungry because the hipster server was too busy with the 14 other customers in the bar to ever come back to take our food order.  I don't even think we got two bucks worth of service out of this place. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"We went for lunch today.  A lot of the pictures of the food for the place are outdated and no longer offered.  For example, they don't have the fish or the brisket.  I was there at 1230  on a Thursday and there was no sign of a buffet.  The physical menus are old and wrinkled.  They should have been replaced months ago.  I ordered beer/cheese soup - tasty, but not really warm.  And the cheese steak - extremely ordinary.  I didn't finish it.  Fries were standard.  My wife had a tortilla soup: It was also barely warm and tasted more like weak chili with beans and a few chips.  She had a side salad that she said was good.  She said it was fresh.  My daughter had taco mac and cheese and she said it was \"good\", but she really meant \"OK\". Wait staff was excellent and atmosphere was OK.  Fast, courteous and friendly.  Music was not too loud.    The acoustics are pretty bad.  The chair legs on our chairs were uneven.  We decided to switch them and they really squealed when slid across the floor.  Small complaint, but annoying nonetheless.  I imagine a conversation would be pretty tough with a dinner crowd.  My wife commented that she wouldn't go back and I agree.  FYI I really wanted to like this place..."}
{"text":"Two bucks provided food for my husband's wake. It was amazing and so appreciated. The staff was friendly and so accommodating. I cannot thank them enough for their compassion and GREAT food."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday around 2pm.  It wasn't very crowded by any means.  Bar was mostly filled, few tables, but otherwise it was nice and casual a place during hours where everything else was super packed.  Very clean place.  Bartender was fantastic and super polite.  Had the jalapeño bacon Mac and cheese and it was the weirdest and best thing I ever tasted.  Certainly worth a visit if smaller bars with good service and good food are your forte."}
{"text":"Music was so LOUD, could not hear server and she could not hear us. Will ne  ver go there again."}
{"text":"2 Bucks is awesome. Everything there is really cheap, and the food is really good bar food. I have been there over 10 times and I always get the deep fried pickles.   The standing up mac & cheese is so good because they use Gouda cheese + you can add bacon, sausage, or chicken on top. They melt the gouda cheese just to where it starts to turn brown in a few spots just like how cheese looks on a pizza. The noodles (ziti) come sticking together and standing straight up, it's such a fun dish.   Also, their chicken wings are so good. I've been to numerous bars that have sub par chicken wings but 2 Buck's boneless wings are juicy on the inside and the perfect amount of crispy on the outside. Not too much sauce, not too little.   There is a really sweet girl waitress/bartender there who is always really nice and super helpful.   There's big tv's behind the bar which are good for sports games. The best time to go out to eat there would probably be during the day or early in the evening because it does turn into a bar scene late night."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to two bucks in Avon,Ohio yesterday to have a burger and a drink. Well we ordered and all was good, until they brought us our food. My wife's was over cooked and very dry (classic burger that is) and my burger was OK, not great! Then my onion rings that I ordered was so burnt that I guess the cook had a smoke or something that he/or she forgot bout them, I didn't eat anything, just paid and left. But I can not believe they even served them thinking I was going to eat them, just for later references not everybody is a DRUNK!!! Thank you"}
{"text":"I have to give two stars only because my first time here was great. We had a fantastic server and great food. Jump forward six months and I had the worst experience probably ever. We went in around 6pm. Wait forever to just order drinks. We both got sprite. We got our drinks and noticed black and gray stuff floating in the drinks so we sent it back. Our next round had the same problem so we sent them back again. Still dirty the third time so I ordered a bottle of beer that way there couldn't possibly be crap floating in it. This whole time our food took far too long. The fried pickle that I loved the first time came soggy in oil. My boyfriends burger was so undercooked it could moo. I ordered the same thing as last time and got a doughy undercooked pizza. I was so disappointed because I loved everything the first time I was there and this was the first time my boyfriend was going. Needless to say he doesn't want to come back ever. I want to give it another chance since I know how good it was the first time but if its like this last time gross no more chances. Seriously how gross do you keep things that black and gray gunk was floating in our drinks!"}
{"text":"I love going there and the bartenders! Food is great, atmosphere is great. Fun place to go!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go with friends from doing trivia to karaoke or just coming up to socialize and have a good drink. The service is wonderful. Can't complain! I just wish the kitchen was open longer. But otherwise no complaints!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a meal & beer during a work trip. Beer was cold, Bucker Burger & buck fries were fantastic, & the bartenders were friendly & quick!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from this place, so I've been there a few times.  This place has one main drawback that bothers me every time I bring friends here.  The music is WAY to loud for a bar.  If they had a dance floor it would be fine... but they don't.  You can't easily have a conversation without yelling or going outside... which sucks  That said... if you catch this place in the afternoon or evening when it is slower, it is pretty sweet.  Open patio.  Cheap drinks.  Cheap (but good) food.  Can't beat the price anywhere in the area.  Also... it's the only bar in the area with almost a \"club\" vibe ... which does count for something regardless of it's drawbacks."}
{"text":"Love that they have Guiness & Bluemoon $2.00 drafts (14oz) all day everyday. Love the mac n cheese, Cheese Steak (Avon Cheese Steak)  & Pulled Pork & Buffalo Chicken Sliders, fried pickles are good. The Rosemary fries are yummy too. Service is slow but when you are playing $2/beer what can you complain about :)"}
{"text":"my daughter and i  decided 2 try it. we both went 4 the asian salad ,they give u a very very small container of dressing. i asked the waiter 4 a couple more of the dressings no problem ,i alsohad a order of french fries which were pretty good.  when we got are our bill we noticed a extra charge 4 the 2 very small containers of dressing  = 50 cents each ==   if u r going 2 nickle dime people like that u r not going 2 stay in business 2 long.  the thing that pissed me the most was waiter not saying '' sorry i have' 2 charge extra the dressing '',  i would of gotten it anyways.  we arrived there about 12:45 and the place was empty  2 at the bar and 1 other table.  next store is friday's rest.  there lot was pretty full.  this place is going 2 have hard time here =  2 other places  didn't fare well =="}
{"text":"Good sliders. I have had several of them, and none of them have been disappointing. Good beer selection also. There fries are great and different, since they use sage. I hear the smoked Gouda Mac and cheese is really good, but haven't had it yet. Great place to watch a game. Kinda cold in there when it's cold outside, since one wall raises up to open up to the outside when warmer outside."}
{"text":"First, I despise being addressed as \"Bud\", especially by a bartender.  The Miller Lite was good, even though I just wanted a plain old burger, the only thing in a full sized burger was one with onion ring and egg, but came with fries for $9.  The bun was soft but dry without Mayo, so I asked for Mayo....   well now, the burger was just so so, nothing to write home about, and when the check came, well I had been charged for two beers insted of just one, and, and, the little bit of Mayo was added at 50 cents!!!  What, 50 cents for Mayo?    The place has been through about 3 or 4 names/owners in the past five years, and I certainly look at them to be the next failure there.  You can't nickle and time, especially witha  $9 burger, that just isn't all that!"}
{"text":"Went back for dinner with a large group.  Even if they aren't all $2, the drinks are all quite cheap.  I like that the foods are mostly served in small, low-priced portions so you can either get a lighter meal or mix and match things.  The only negative was that a few people were served food well before the rest of the group, which is always a bit awkward.  The buffalo mac and cheese was good, and I heard a lot of compliments on the meatball sliders.  The $2 fries are a good value."}
{"text":"Friendly bartenders, good food, and cold drinks. My buddy couldn't decide on which vodka he wanted and had the bartender choose and surprise him. Every drink was different for him. Made it even more fun that night. Football games were playing on the tvs and the local regulars made you feel welcome. Ask about the sliders since they aren't in the regular menu. Stay away from the mango habernaero wings...they were too sweet and not enough heat. But it was a great place for good fast bar food, drinks, and conversation!"}
{"text":"Two bucks is that kind of hole in the wall place that has good food, cheap beer, and a welcome feel. They are best known for their Mac and cheese which you can't go wrong with any of their choices. Apps are super inexpensive and go great with a drink. For under 10$ you have a good after work spot."}
{"text":"What's not to love about a place that has super cheap drinks! I got a tall and a short summer shandy and my total was $7. Wahoo! They always have drink specials on their mixed drinks and a $2 menu board of the day!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to come when your too broke to go out downtown. This is a really, really nice corner bar. Most of the customers grew up in the area and go here because they don't know how to drive on the freeway (because they never leave the city). This is quite the party spot on the weekends, especially in the summer when we are able to utilize the smokey patio. They play good music, it's clean and safe (unless your a drunk driver).  The pricing is nice and low, like I like it. The food is good, for the price you pay it's def a great value. The service is a hit or miss, the guys have been great, some of the women bartenders have done a good job of ignoring me from time to time.   The drinks start at $2 (well liquor and domestic beer) and then go up from there. The shots start at $2, but you will pay $5 a shot for top shelf if they even have it. They run out of the good sh*t all the time.   This is def like a club on Saturday nights, during the week it can be so dead. If your in the area and are hungry for some food and drinks I would def recommend this place, they don't disappoint."}
{"text":"Dope place everybody is like family.  Always have a good time.  Food is amazing on Point."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Food is great-people are great! Karaoke on Sunday's is fun! There are a lot of options in the area but I find myself choosing 2$ almost exclusively"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch the other day, and I'm glad I did. Definitely has a bit of a bar atmosphere, building-wise, which is a little generically off-putting during the day, but the food (Buck Burger) and prices were excellent."}
{"text":"Tried to go here to eat for lunch.  The parking lot was so badly ice covered I was sliding around.  My dinning partner also almost fell so we hobbled back to the car.   The worst of the ice was right in front of the strip where no cars were parked.  Also, it was hard to till if the place was even open.  I had driven past it last week and no one was around and no cars there either."}
{"text":"You obviously need to know one of the bartenders to get service here. \"Katie\" chose to talk to her friends while we waited to get our beers.  Then ignored us some more when we wanted our check. Would have tried out the food but wad too irritated with the service to try it. Never again."}
{"text":"Not completely their fault, but we went there again today and after 45 minutes of waiting for our food, we left. There was a group of people ahead of us but they need to be able to adapt."}
{"text":"Great spot! Love the $2 sliders (fish was my fav), $2 smoked Gouda Mac! Awesome Moscow Mule in a copper glass!   This place makes moving to the burbs ok!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere is maximum unpretentious, the service is always good and the food is really good. Whether celebrating a birthday or watching a game, I've never had a negative experience here. We are here tonight for an adult dinner for two and we had to order three appetizers to get our total food bill to $30 including two entrees. We got buffalo chicken flatbread and a steak-and-bleu salad for entrees and fried mushrooms, fried calamari and house-made pork rinds to get there (to take advantage of an offer). The apps were served very fresh and hot, and the pork rinds were *still crackling* and very, very good. The salad was served with a nice balsamic dressing. The buffalo chicken flatbread was delicious.   The only quibbles for us are 1) the flatbread came with tomatoes and had to be remade, and (super minor) the pork rinds were sprinkled with seasoning, unevenly...maybe if they were quickly tossed with seasoning, it would be better. So slightly poor execution but what we are in the end was still incredibly good and a good value."}
{"text":"For an inexpensive beer and a quick pub meal- this is a great place!! The beers are really only $2! The sliders are good- but it's the Flatbreads that keep us coming back. I love the Caprese Flat Bread and my husband likes the Avon.... and we both LOVE the homemade cut fries. Overall- it's a great value with a nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews I just couldn't bring myself to eat at the hotel bar, even with my 20% company discount. I came here, and it was great. I started with the $2 side salad. It wasn't the best but okay...good size but mostly just iceberg lettuce, though. Nothing special. However, the buffalo chicken flatbread was great and also a great deal for $6! Oh yeah, as advertised, all the drinks are really cheap, too!"}
{"text":"So today was my second try of two buck and i was not disappointed.  I wanted to explore there menu since they had many options that were not your normal bar food.  Service was amazing and i can say better then my first visit ( solid 5 stars!)  I ordered the bacon jalapeno tots which are giant,  packed with flavor and even better with the dipping sauce they come with.  In addition to the tots i ordered the smoker mac and cheese, presentation was beyond bar food.  The mac it self had an amazing balance of flavor, smokey gooey cheese, sweet bourbon sauce and the crunch of the caramelized onion and fresh green onion on it were to die for!  My most recent experience has brought them to that 5 star level in my opinion (never been there at peak times) but the times i have, have been amazing and i will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation here for a celebratory dinner with some family members to celebrate a new job.  From the beginning I knew I shouldn't have went here. The red flags were apparent from the very first conversation I had with the woman who answered the phone.   When I called to make my reservation the woman was extremely short and told me that I HAD TO CALL HER BACK because she was busy doing something else. Which I feel is very unprofessional. Eventually the reservation was made for 630 after an inconvenient runaround with scheduling.   All of us arrived at 620, and we were seated immediately in a section that they had created for us. Everyone ordered and we conversed whiled we waited. One person in the group got their meal before the rest, understandable as we had a group of 8, but the next five orders didn't come out for another 20 minutes. In which the first person had almost already finished eating. Then the last two meals came out another 10 minutes later and were completely wrong and not even close to what they had ordered so it was sent back. I can't speak for the quality of everyone else's food but my burger was order medium and was VERY well done when it finally made it to our table.   I love the Two Bucks at the intersection of Broadview and Sprague it's absolutely AMAZING and I've never had a single issue with that location. Like I said it's perfect, 5 stars out of 5 stars. We only came to this Middleburg Hts. location as to not inconvenience the majority of our group.   NO ONE IN OUR GROUP WILL BE RETURNING TO THIS LOCATION. Save yourself the frustration and drive the extra 15 minutes to the other location on Broadview."}
{"text":"This place has been recommended to me by more than a few people. We were in the area after a movie and thought we would go check it out.   My dinner companion had been here before. So he was the expert to guide me. The mac-n-cheese is what to get. So I'm told.   I got the Rancher. My friend got the Wake-n-Bake. Then we got the loaded fries to split. Let me tell you, this was the bomb! Rancher was delish! I would get it again in a split second. AND the fries were great. Here is the thing, you get it and it looks like it's not that much. But it is. After a few bites of fries and all of my Rancher I was more than full.   This is a definite return. I figure I'll work thru the menu and try more dishes. Fun atmosphere too! Plus I gotta eat something closer to the $2 name! LOL!!"}
{"text":"It's okay.  We decided to try Two Bucks when our usual bar was overcrowded from patrons watching the fights on t.v.  The inside is decorated pretty simply and while I appreciate that they don't have a painfully cheesy theme like some chain restaurants, it could really use a little personality.  Just seemed like we could be in any bar anywhere, there was nothing to set it apart (besides the cardboard cutout, that was cool).  The food was actually pretty good, certainly better than I expected, and the drinks, while nothing special, were cheap and didn't taste watered down.  I think the one thing they really need to work on is the service.  The bartenders were all really nice but there's so few of them that it can take forever to get your drinks refilled or your food brought to your table, and it sucks to go out and have half your group get their food 15 minutes before the others.  I feel bad that they have to run around so much-- they really do their best, but the owners should think about hiring a few more employees, maybe someone who would just be a waitress instead of trying to take orders and make drinks.  Overall, the patrons all seem nice and the staff is friendly too.  We've been back to Two Bucks and will probably continue going every once in a while, but it probably won't be our \"go-to\" spot unless they improve the service."}
{"text":"It was good when it was first opened, but it has gone down hill over the last year.  The patio smells like cigarette smoke and the inside smells moldy (like my 95 year old grandma's house);    Regarding the service:  I come from a generation where you don't get a tattoo on your neck, but the servers are nice and very attentive.  The Gouda mac and cheese is good.  Thank Goodness for Strip and Heck's - at lease there are two decent restaurants in Avon."}
{"text":"I don't typically ever go to \"bars\", but one night, during a Cavs game, my family and I were hungry and stopped in as it was the only thing that was open.  Though it took some extra time due to the crowd, the food was DELICIOUS! I was surprised how good it really was! My grandmother (yes, I went to watch a basketball game with my 83 year old grandmother) LOVED her garlic wings.  I loved the mac and cheese, and my cousin was very pleased with the burger.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We were here for a lunch on Sunday because the Thai place was closed. :(  Prices are great. Small menu but some great stuff on the menu. Not your typical pub grub. My friend and I ordered the grilled cheese & tomato soup. It was thick rich soup with a cheesy flat bread sandwich and it was really really good,  My friend loves the buffalo chicken mac N cheese. Most menu items are $8 or less.   Drinks were cheap and they had a good draft list. The shot of the month is only $2-3.  The game was on, but the place wasn't too loud....Then again it was also Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"I was contacted by the manager, Kas, as I run a large social group in the area.  I had 45 people show up on a Monday night.  Kas was so wonderful and provided raffle tickets and six gift bags with tshirts, glasses, etc.  This is ridiculously cheap!  For $13 I had Two sliders (one Asian chicken, one Philly cheesesteak), a big ole bowl of amazing mac & cheese, and two Original Sin ciders.  The sliders could have been better but for $13 for all of that, they were worth it.  The servers were attentive, the place was clean, and they also had a spacious patio.  I liked the openness of the location as well.  I'm headed back for another event on 6/27!"}
{"text":"Been here for about 40 minutes and we're still waiting on our food. I'm beyond irritated. No fresh tea, no coffee. What the heck? Never again. If the food is the best ever we won't return.   Ha! Got a compliment from Kaitlyn P telling me she recalls me personally. Wow. Amazing. Nope. You're not getting me to set foot in your place again. The food was mediocre at best. Not worth the irritation that I got the first time around."}
{"text":"We stopped in this place before a Captain's game and I was not disappointed. The prices were very fair and there was enough seating for all of us. Being on the same side of the stadium makes this place the perfect spot to grab a drink before or after the game. They also have outdoor seating which is great if your looking for this. I also remember that all of the staff was attentive and friendly. If I lived in the area this would be a regular spot for me!"}
{"text":"After my first visit in 2014, I was not sure if I was going to stop back in when I was back in town.  But Oct. 8, 2015 was my return to Two Bucks.  I have changed my ranking from One to a Three.  First I would like to tell people who come in to eat here is to sign up for the Belly Card.  You check-in with it and you get free stuff and this place will honor it.  With my Belly Card got a free Side Salad which was pretty good.  Ordered a Traveler Beer and a Buffalo Chicken Wrap with Fries.  Food was good, fries just a little too salty but eatable.  The beer menu was up-to-date and the beer I order was in stock, which is a plus.  Server was attentive and nice.  I sat at the bar and my server's was named Kelly.  Big improvement from the first time I came in and eat with my friend.  Which this time I came alone because I did not want to put my friend through what happen last time, if it was to repeat.  Lucky it did not."}
{"text":"Two Bucks Avon is absolutely magical and a unicorn bar.    Last night, my husband had 2 beers and 3 delicious themed Titos mules. I had 2 margaritas with great tequila & 3 shareable buckets. (That I did not share and posted a photo below for size.) We also both had a delicious PBJ mixed drink and a round of Jameson breakfast shots with our neighbors who we were so glad came out with us.   All of the food we ordered was delicious and I wish I had taken pictures of more of the drinks because they were great as   We will be back, Two Bucks & we love you."}
{"text":"First let me say this bar has a ton of potential. The concept of $2 a beer is really a great one for people on a budget... there was a great selection of $2 beers, and also some craft brews that were $3-$4. The atmosphere was good, they had a jukebox, but the thing that ruined my experience was the service. Over half the time we were there, there wasn't a single person behind the bar. When an employee did show up, they were scrambling to refill drinks, and then they would disappear again. There were a couple dozen customers at the bar and at tables, and at least 4 people \"working\", yet most drinks were empty and even after a few customers voiced complaints, the service remained terrible. My friend and I agreed that we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I like Two Bucks. I really do. You can't beat their drink prices. $2 Magic Hat? Yes please! And the food is pretty tasty. Nicole M. described the mac and cheese perfectly in her review...\"a spectacular mound of creamy Gouda gooiness\". I couldn't have said it better myself. I love the concept of the mix and match sliders for $2. I can have pulled pork, a burger and a philly steak all in one night without feeling guilty! We also had the calamari which was crispy and had a yummy dipping sauce. The wait staff has always been friendly and attentive, even on their busiest nights.  So why the 3 star rating you ask? I really don't like the vibe of the clientele. I feel uneasy each time I go in there. It always seems filled with an \"Old Avon\" crowd. Those of you who have been around the Westside burbs know what I mean when I say \"Old Avon\". For those of you who don't, I am talking about people who were born in Avon, live in Avon, and will most likely die in Avon. The old school clans who have a street named after their family and act like the Hatfields and the McCoys. They just always seem a little rough around the edges. Each time I'm in Two Bucks there seems to be a group of these people in there acting loud and rowdy and I am constantly worried a brawl is going to break out and John Deer hats and Carharts are going to go flying!  I'm still going to frequent Two Bucks...I can't let anything get between me and that mac and cheese! However I might take Nicole's advice and start going a little earlier in the evening to avoid the ruckus."}
{"text":"Was in town for a couple of days.  The location was close to my hotel and thought I would give them a shot.  Bar tender was very friendly and helpful.   I did not eat so I cannot tell you anything about the food. This is a nice place to come and unwind from a busy day."}
{"text":"Prices are great, both drinks and food. Service can be slowww when it's busy, but the low tab can make that seem less annoying.  Buffalo Chicken Flatbread for $5 - great. Big pieces of chicken, perfect sauce. Mac & Cheese for $2 - amazing. Just get it. I promise."}
{"text":"Two Bucks has that perfect mix of a clean establishment, great food, and great prices. The staff seems genuinely happy to be there and provides great service. You can buy a couple rounds, get some killer boneless wings, and enjoy the laid back atmosphere.   I'm pretty picky about my bars, and this is one of the places that I'll leave my apartment to go to.   Really, how can you go wrong with $2 Guinness and $2 Jameson?"}
{"text":"i really like this place.  the food tastes good and is house made.  the black bean burger and mac and cheese and liked them both very much.  service is great.  cocktails are excellent.  Been here 4 times and will go back."}
{"text":"Went with a group to catch up with a relative in from Texas. The service left a bit to be desired. It was slow and unfriendly. The server insisted that I had ordered a drink the I hadn't. Food was cold and undercooked. The manager tried to work it out, but I stiil probably won't go back.."}
{"text":"I would give it 1 star but I have to admit the food is very good for the price.  Unfortunately it's the worst service I have experienced at a bar.  I been here three times (because of the food) and took me 5 minutes to be asked if I want a drink.  Once I finished my drink it took them 10 minutes to even approach me to ask if I wanted another.  The traffic wasn't heavy it just seemed like they wanted to hang out with their own friends in the back."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. My friends and I all ordered Mac n cheese, which was very good! However later that night 3/4 of us got food poisoning. I decided to give this bar food another chance a few months later. My fiancé and I ordered some onion rings to split. While I was eating one, I noticed it part of it was much harder to chew than the rest. Upon further inspection I saw that all the onion rings still had the outer skin on them, and they were breaded that way. The only reason I'm giving this a 2 star review is because the wait staff was nice and understanding and gave us a $5 gift card to use next time."}
{"text":"Me and 2 friends stopped in with our 2 10 year old children, celebrating my birthday. A couple of cocktails and fries for the kids. At 8:50 PM we were told we would have to leave because the children were NOT 21 years old. The place was basically empty. Have been there before and it is NEVER CROWDED. Poor decision by management. They lost our business."}
{"text":"BBQ pulled pork mac & cheese!  I am totally taking several trips back to try the buffalo chicken mac, bacon and jalapeno mac, and their $2 sliders and fried pickles.  Plus when I was there they had $6 pitchers.  Great food and cheap beer is awesome.  This place would be pub perfect if the staff could smile once in a while, they were all so serious."}
{"text":"I hesitate w/ the 2 stars.  This is a great place to go and get a drink.  Food....its not great; I've had better.    The service was kind of weird this time I visited but there was a \"loaner\" from the Avon store.  I guess the bar must be set up differently.  Either that or he sucks at the Avon location too.  The food came pretty quickly and for lack of a better word was uninspired.  I'll go back because it is a convenient location, especially for a drink prior to going to the movies.The food, the food could use some love.  I guess I shouldn't expect much for a menu that is predominately under $7 for its items."}
{"text":"I frequent Two Bucks a couple times a month. The food is outstanding and the prices are good. The Mac N Cheese is the best I have ever had. The only issue with this location is the poor service. I was there this weekend sitting at the Bar. It wasn't very busy but it took 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged me. This is very common for this location. They have had a turnover of staff but it doesn't seem to make a difference."}
{"text":"I was just spending a night at the Marriott Courtyard and wanted a place for a couple of beers and something to eat.  The reviews were pretty good, so I checked it out and I'm glad I did.  It took a couple minutes at the bar to get a beer, but they were great after that.  Everything on the menu sounded good, but as on old fat bastard I had to opt for the Cobb salad.  I was pleasantly surprised as salads can sometimes suck at places like this.  Next time, I'm having macncheese, wings, sliders, etc..."}
{"text":"Bottom Line:  Thank God I don't live nearby!!!  This is the kind of place I wish was nearby me.  It's always the same people working the bar/floor.  They have great food, plenty of drink options and there's always a good crowd - especially on Trivia night or anytime the local teams are playing.  1 Shot of Tito's 1 Half Order Boneless Chicken Wings 1 Order Mac & Cheese 2 23 oz Yuengling Lager Draft  = $18.90 !!!!!!!  3 Shots of Tito's 1 Order Mac & Cheese 1 Half Order Boneless Chicken Wings 1 23 oz Yuengling Lager Draft  = $20.52  That is a steal.  Like I said - thank God I don't live nearby.  I would be there 3 or 4 times a week.  I think I have mentioned in the Tips - the Macaroni & Cheese is Crack!!  There are several variations - I always get the original.  It is made with ziti pasta.  The pasta stands up in the bowl and they pour a white creamy smoked gouda cheese sauce over the top and it oozes down into the ziti tubes.  Just believe me - you have to try it.  The boneless wings are plump and juicy.  A half order of that and the M&C will fill you up.  One of my friends always gets a salad and the sliders.  She raves about it - but hasn't convinced me to forgo my M&C! Probably about 75% of our group usually has one of the M&C's.  There's always 1 or 2 in the group that get a burger and they have always been happy with their choices.  Where else can you get $2 shots of Tito's and $3 23 oz Yuengling Drafts?  We were there one night and participated in the Trivia night.  Our team didn't win but we had plenty of fun playing.  The patrons seem like they are all locals and it's always a good crowd.  I am in CLE often for work and when we are there it is a given we are all heading over to Two Bucks!  If you are in town - you should too!"}
{"text":"Just file this place under my ongoing list of \"Thank God I don't live close\" places!!  Love Love Love this place!  I don't know how it is possible that I have not already written a review?!?!?! Probably becasue i would just second all of the other reviews........  The Macaroni and Cheese is ___________  - insert any high praise word you can think of and it fits - delicious, cheesy, filling, great price, huge variety, the best, never had better, unique and on and on.  The fact that they have so many beer options for $2 makes it an affordable night.  They also have 4 or 5 $2 appetizer options.  i usually get a few beers, mac & cheese and some sliders and it's under $20.  My idea of the perfect night out.  It always seems like a local crowd which is always a good sign,  We've been there on Trivia night and that draws a big crowd.  All my friends always go here when we have a CLE layover and no one ever walks out disappointed."}
{"text":"I visited Two Bucks during a one day visit to the Cleveland area. Two Bucks is a unique gastropub which offered a limited selection of quality draft beers for amazing prices.  Two dollars will get you a generously poured Guinness or Sam Adams winter lager, and four will get you Kentucky bourbon barrel ale or two other equally stellar brews.  Taking the previous yelpers' advice, I tried the Mac and cheese which was amazing, also for two dollars.    I found the environment to be nice for reading, and the staff was very friendly.  The decor is simple but modern, with a stainless steel bar and matching table seating.  I would highly recommend paying a visit to this pub if you are looking for great beer and great food at prices that are hard to beat."}
{"text":"This place is now our go to place in Avon / Avon lake area for bar food and a quick drink.  The apps are great and the staff are very tentative to your needs during the dining experience."}
{"text":"I have always had a great time at Two Bucks. I enjoy the atmosphere, the younger crowd, the service, the drinks, THE PRICES!! And the food is great, too! Its unofficial, but I'm kind of a Mac and cheese enthusiast...and I just HAVE to try the mac and cheese at any restaurant I go, so I have to say, the mac and cheese is wonderful and beautifully presented. See you soon, two bucks!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. Limited food and drink options, slow staff and the \"regulars\" are not necessarily those one would prefer to associate with."}
{"text":"We've been here plenty of times. Pretty good food. Some items are $2 but not many. Basic bar food. Great fried pickles and other fried goodies. Really like their burgers. Good spot for the locals and late night for people of all ages."}
{"text":"Went to Two Bucks for a get-together with a dozen coworkers. The restaurant has table and bar seating, but also a lounge area with couches that was big enough to accommodate our large party. We did have to bring in extra chairs but the waitress was kind enough to carry them in.   We were able to place orders for our drinks. Service was prompt. Since we had a large party, the waitress kept each of our tabs separate.  I didn't know what our plan was as a group - I thought maybe we'd each eat at separate tables and convene later for drinks and a group photo. However, the lounge area worked well for us, so we stayed there he whole time. We all ordered and shared a slew of appetizers. We ordered garlic-Parmesan chicken wings (delicious), buffalo wings (yummy with a nice kick), fried pickles (I did not try these, but my coworkers said they were good), flatbread (it had mozzarella, pesto + tomato = very tasty!), cheese curds (my 1st time ever trying these - very good, like a mozzarella stick), and seasoned French fries (very good, seasoned well)  We paid for our drinks separately but we split the tab on the food, so I'm not sure how much the food cost. However, from the looks of the menu and my share, I'd say the food was extremely affordable. The quality of the food was excellent for the price. I can't wait to go back with just my husband for a sit-down dinner!  For our drinks, I only ordered a ginger ale and orange juice. I had gotten refills 3 times and my total drink tab was only $3, how about that?  The atmosphere is similar to that of any restaurant-bar. There are large-screen TVs all over, including the lounge area.   Our waitress was Denise, and she was very good. She did a great job with our orders and the tabs. She was helpful in getting us chairs and helped take our group photos - we had to ask her 3 different times because none of us brought a camera and our phones took bad photos LOL. (Sorry, Denise!)  I would recommend Two Bucks for a nice night out with a group of friends.  Great service, great food and very affordable prices."}
{"text":"Terrible.  The food was disgusting, the chicken in my wrap looked like it came from a can.  The bartender was also too busy talking to her friends and never brought out our appetizer that we ordered.  She also never asked if we wanted a refill on our drinks until she brought out our check and rushed us out of there.  First and last time there.  Save yourself the headache and money.  On a positive note the fries weren't bad."}
{"text":"Made my first visit here today in the afternoon.  Service was fast and the food was great.  i ordered the fish sandwich and a beer.  The slaw and tartar sauce complemented the fish nicely.  The fries were cooked just right and had a nice garlic and salt taste.  The other 3 people I came in with also enjoyed their food.  I was impressed with how clean everything was.  Very well kept for a bar.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Colin gave us phenomenal service.  We will be back here every Monday when he is working!! New favorite bartender."}
{"text":"The wife and I swung by for dinner. We ended not drinking anything outside of water. Server was also acting as a bartender. So overall things took a while. Ordered the chicken tortilla soup and mac n' cheese for apps. Both were VERY good. I split fries while the wife has a flat bread chicken blue-cheese combo. She said that with having mac n' cheese for an app, plus this flat bread was a bit much. That's on her ordering skills. The flat bread crust was darn tasty. I had the pork loin wrap. Overall it was fine, but lacked flavor. The food is a step above normal bar food and cheap still. Our total bill was $20 plus tip. We'll be heading back for sure.....and drinking some brews this time!"}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I went to Two Bucks Mayfield Hts. to watch the Spurs vs. Warriors game Saturday May 20, 2017.. we weren't greeted when we walked in but we could figured since it was pretty busy we would just shrugg it off.. we say at the bar waiting to get menus and drinks.. we finally got acknowledged and ordered our drinks.. after eating my boyfriend goes to wash his hands again and use the restroom before we left to go home.. when he came back with a puzzled look on his face I asked him \"what's wrong\" he showed me these pictures.. scratched into the walls were \"too many nigs here's go to ghetto\"  \"leave niga boyfriends at home, bitches we'll give them dick\" like seriously? I would have thought an establishment in golden gate would have more class than to let vandals scratch obscenities into the bathroom walls.. I'm glad I didn't go to the women's bathroom I would have been so upset and left the bar.. I wish we would have seen this before we ordered from there.. just know we will never ever go back I wish I could repost the pictures here but I don't know how"}
{"text":"Yesterday evening, I went for a night out. We were going to start our evening off at Two Bucks. The lot was semi-full. A lot of people were parking at the bank, assuming because it was Cinco De Mayo and El Pelenque is next door. A man walked up to our car and told us we were not allowed to park there. Well, if it's his one job to protect the parking lot, sure. We parked two lots down and walked over. My experience there was positive. There was, surprisingly, a decent amount of people there that the Guardian of the Parking Lot must not have gotten to. I sat at a table and my server was quick and on top of everything. We had a great time amongst each other. Then, I looked over to find that man that told me not to park there. He was drinking a beer behind the bar and walking around like he owns the place. Apparently he owns the plaza.  I understand that he wants to save his parking lot for customers, but he didn't even ask us where we were going. We said something to him on our way out. I'm giving it 3 stars because my service was excellent and I did enjoy only paying $3 for the shots of Cuervo. I'm not one to write negative reviews, but there was plenty of parking spots and we were planning on going there in the first place. Him walking up to us and telling us \"YOU CAN'T PARK HERE\" was uncalled for.  Also, I wouldn't think twice if I saw the owner sitting at the bar having a drink. But this man was behind the bar, beer in hand, and it was extremely unprofessional. The rest of the staff was pleasant. My Buffalo Dip was excellent. My drinks came in a timely manner. Everybody there did their job and they did it well. I feel bad leaving a negative review, but I will not patronize this establishment again as long as this man has any point of authority."}
{"text":"OK this review may be biased, because I did not eat there, only drank. Went there after a wedding, no idea what I was in store for.  I ordered a Guinness and 6 pineapple upside down cake shots (because I am awesome, and nice, and was making new friends from said wedding).  The bartender said $20.  I was like, oh no honey, I needed a Guinness and 6 shots...yes ma'am, $20. Ho-lee-crap.  The Guinness was $2 and the shots were $3 each.  That is unheard of!!!  Both bartenders were super nice and got quite a kick out of my orgasmic reaction to their pricing :)  Anyway, I feel that I should make it my mission move to the Cleveland area just to bankrupt this place with my iron liver!   If I do ever head back there, I will definitely be visiting there again!"}
{"text":"Food was horrible. Service sucked. Bartender would rather show off her boobs then give good service. My wife got the buff dip. It was watery and just plain nasty. I got sesame wings and beer battered curd sticks. My wings were dry. The curd sticks were the only things that I liked. Very disappointed all around. I live 2 min from here. It could have been our local hangout."}
{"text":"I have yet to order something I don't like. The prices can't be beat either. Always a nice place to go if you wanna see friendly faces quickly and cheaply."}
{"text":"Very good boneless wings and sliders. I'm a fan. Hard to beat the food the price and the service is excellent. Went here three times during my stay in Cleveland with work."}
{"text":"At first glance this restaurant looks like another typical sports bar, but looks are deceiving. It's a relaxed, family friendly bar atmosphere which I am seeing more of these days. We were immediately waited on by Erica O. She was sweet and courteous. The menu is refreshingly different from the usual pub fare, in that they have a cool $2 menu of tasty sliders and other apps. I started off with a Mexican mule made with some kinda cinnamon tequila. It was different but good. Then my hubby ordered a Cuban slider and a black and blue slider. I ordered the fried pickles. All 3 were just $2 each (what a deal) and really tasty. The Cuban slider did have a bit too much sauce on it, though.   For our dinners we had the Classic burger with sage fries and the cauliflower steak burger with onion rings. It's really exciting for me as a vegetarian that there are items on the menu that I can eat other than the typical lousy black bean burger! Both burgers were tasty, but I found the sun-dried tomato aioli to be a bit too greasy for my liking on the cauliflower burger.   I look forward to my next visit to Two Bucks so I can explore more of their interesting menu.  Worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about moving to Cleveland, (besides the weather, the people and the sports teams) is that you can go to a bar and get drinks and food on the cheap. It makes you feel like even if it isn't great, you only paid X amount of dollars so it's fine.   Two Bucks is a place that charges $2 for several items on their menu and some draft beers and they are great. So the general feeling is \"holy crap, what a deal!\" You've seen the picture of their smokey Gouda mac and cheese, now go buy it for $2. I ate one there and got one to go. It was great. The most creative way I've ever seen mac and cheese. And did I mention in was $2? We also tried a sampling of sliders that were creative and tasty. I recommend any of the beef ones the most and the mushroom was great too. They had magic hat on tap and it was 3 bucks. Still an amazing deal.   The only disappointment was the calamari. The sauce was nice, but the rings were miniscule and all I tasted was the batter.   There are tons of fun things to try on the menu, and I'm looking to going back!  PS The bar was really clean. (a cool old garage building with a patio) But it was mostly white walls with just a poster here or there. It seems like it had just been built. I was hoping to bring in a $2 and staple it to the ceiling. The place needed some visual personality."}
{"text":"So I know nothing about the inside establishment or what their food is only because I parked in the parking lot of this establishment which is in a shopping plaza right next to this establishment is the captain stadium I parked there to stand on the street so I can watch the founders day parade go by and afterwords I had full intention I'm going in there and trying a hamburger and grabbing a cold beer because it's 90° owner of the establishment came out very rudely told I cannot park there to go to the captain stadium and the carnival that is going on right now and he will have my car towed I told him I'm going to watch the parade I'm not going over to the fair I don't think it is very smart business plan when your new establishment in my city to be rude to potential customers being a disabled veteran I try to avoid confrontation at all times therefore I chose to walk away and just tell him to tow my car by the way the parade was awesome"}
{"text":"When first walked in wasn't impressed then very friendly waitress came over and suggested cool bucket drinks omg !   it was delicious ,she suggested items on menu food was good and the price was Great we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The staff is very attentive and the atmosphere is very vibrant. Always a great time without breaking the bank"}
{"text":"Love the quick appetizers! Great food and good prices. I would give this  place a B plus. The loud music is annoying. Servers are prompt and pleasant"}
{"text":"I had read some good things about Two Bucks so I made sure to stop by during a road trip across northern Ohio.  I thought the name was clever until I realized that literally everything we ordered was $2.  Mixed drinks?  $2.  Bottled beer?  $2.  Gouda mac n cheese?  $2.    We could not have been happier to stumbled upon this gem and even returned during our brief weekend stay.  We took in a minor league baseball game while in town (Lake Erie Crushers) and the this Two Bucks location seemed to be where the after party was.  Highly recommended for some afternoon drinking and snacking.  The beer selection wasn't all that great, but the mixed drinks were worth the $2.  I definitely had more than one."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, been coming here forever and I always have great service.. we moved out of the area so we haven't been in awhile, we decided to stop in after a later dinner and rob poured our drinks before we ordered, haven't seen us in months and he didn't forget! Thats great service. We come to two bucks not because the food is spectacular, but because of the service! (Foods not bad! Ha!) thanks Rob for being awesome!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We have been coming here since we moved to the area a couple of years ago. They have great food, far better than your typical local bar joint. Their drink options whether its a beer on tap or a fancy girly drink are terrific. The service has been fantastic. There were a couple of times when they were crazy busy and it was a little understaffed but only twice over two years time. The atmosphere is laid back and friendly. One of our favorite spots."}
{"text":"Have been here numerous times since it opened up and have honestly had a great time each visit.  Heck, its happy hour all the time there and the food is great.  On top of that the management team and staff are always very friendly and polite.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I would mention as it gets later it gets busier and busier."}
{"text":"Ok so I went back today and got jalapeno bacon Mac n cheese and it was over the top good!"}
{"text":"Loved their two buck sliders, tasty fries and secret sauce. A fun lunch!"}
{"text":"Horrible food! My boyfriend and I ordered out from here and got terrible food. The sandwich I got was so overly salty and the beer cheese on it didn't taste like cheese whatsoever. The wings were the worst wings I've ever had! They were so hard only little pieces of it were edible. All the food sounded so good but I was very disappointed with the prices and the low quality of the food. Safe to say I won't order from here again.."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the area, and thought that we would try the newly opened Two Bucks restaurant.   The menu selections are limited, but there were some pretty decent choices.  I opted for the black/bleu sliders which are 3 for $6.   There were at least 8-10 slider choices and for $1 extra, you can mix and match your selection.  My husband ordered the boneless barbecue wings ($8).  We also order the sage & garlic french fries (a la carte $2), the waitress mentioned that the portion was large enough to share.   Our order arrived promptly, and upon glancing at the fries, we knew immediately that we would need another order...lol!.  My burgers were cooked well, with just a sprinkling of bleu cheese and a cajun aioli spread, which conflicted with the bleu cheese, just a little bit.  I scraped off the spread.  My husband thought that the boneless wings were sufficient.  The star of the meal was definitely the fries.  Handcut, deep-fried and tossed with sage and garlic.  They were cooked perfectly, not at all greasy and as I mentioned previously, we had two orders.  All-in-all this was an ok meal, great price $19 for 2 entrees, 2 orders of fries and beverages. The staff was super friendly.   I would return."}
{"text":"This place is great. Food is upscale bar food especially their Mac and cheese. Burgers have great flavor and staff is very friendly. This place is still a secret to the general area. They deserve more business !"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more than 3 stars because it has so much potential but I just can't. I've gone here a few times and the drinks are very cheap and they taste good (not watered down). I've only eaten here once but I enjoyed the food. I had a burger (with an egg on it) and fries and it was really good. My disappointment with this place is it's service! OMG it is horrible. I've only been after 8pm so I'm hoping during the lunch hour it's better. The last time I went here there were some immature young adults (it's shocking to me that they were 21) in here being very loud and annoying while I was sitting at the bar trying to enjoy my drinks. I didn't complain because it is a bar so my husband asked the waitress would we get service if we sat at one of the tables and she said \"sure as long as it's not too busy at the bar I'll come over and help you.\" We sat at the table, finished our drinks, watched her stand there doing nothing and never did she come to serve us! There was another waitress there that was friends with the annoying crowd and she didn't bother to serve anyone but them. Finally after waiting there for 15 minutes we decided to just leave. As we went to the front to pay the waitress say \"sorry I didn't make it to you but it got so busy over here\" (b$llsh#t). We didn't respond to her nonsense excuse and handed her the money and left. Meanwhile the other waitress was still catering to her annoying friends smh!"}
{"text":"Kid friendly but it was more of a bar than a restaurant. They seemed a bit understaffed but very accommodating if you were a regular. Mainly bar food."}
{"text":"my boyfriend and i were so excited to try this place and it was SUCH a letdown. we showed up and saw not one staff member. we weren't sure if we were supposed to wait to be seated or seat ourselves, so we did the latter. again, we were just waiting and waiting and waiting until a bartender started making rounds serving drinks. she passed us and didn't even notice we had no menus. it took her over five minutes to even notice we were there! keep in mind, business was slow-there were maybe 4 tables occupied?   when she gave us our drinks, she didn't say a word to us, or when she took our order. she actually walked away while i said thank you! she maybe said one sentence to us the entire time we were there.   another bonus to our awesome service? we saw her on her phone behind the bar and she even ordered lottery tickets at one of the machines in two bucks! really? you can do that but you can't wait on your customers? i'm never coming here again and i wouldn't recommend this place to ANYONE. the portions were ridiculously small, it was overpriced, and the service was the worst i've ever had. we left hungry!"}
{"text":"It's a bar for sure but with seriously righteously excellent food.   H Got the carnitas wrap and mac& cheese with spicy sausage and I can't believe I am eating this great food with a Souther Tier IPA for lunch on just a random stop.   Definitely gonna be a return trip."}
{"text":"It's not bad, but could be way better. I went in wanting the stuffed mushroom sliders--they did not have them!! They said it must be on their fall menu. I ordered some burger from the summer menu. The fries came cold, the fried onions were cold and the burgers were not made to order. The 9 dollar spinach and artichoke dip was worth about 3 bucks. TV's were crisp and new. The tiny menu on the table is not readable and they catch you on their mini martinis that are two dollars only on Tuesdays. You just have to have good food to get more stars. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Ok so I first heard about two bucks from some co workers. They said they have good food so today my wife and I decided to try out their brand new location in Eastlake ohio. First off when we walked in the door I was very happy with how the establishment looked. I noticed a drink menu on the table and to surprise most beers were $2 with higher end beers a dollar or two dollars more. Cheap shots and mixed drinks as well as wine prices. Amazing prices for drinking while there for some grub and a game. When we walked it a girl behind the bar was very prompt and got us menus and waters. Now mind you there were only two girls working the floor and the place was steady and only got a bit busier as we sat it did take about 10 minutes for our order to be taken but I can understand the longer wait since they were picking up and getting more people in the establishment. So I placed an appetizer order of fried pickles for $2.00. They took a bit to come out but once they did my first thought was there are huge! Only to take a bite and realize that over 90% of it was breading with a very very thin pickle. Now It was only $2.00 but pickles are cheap i thought more pickle could've been inside the breading. These I will not order again as they were too greasy for me but did not taste bad just not for me. Now for lunch my wife ordered the pesto chicken burger and it came with fries. For $8.00 it was a good portion. She ate it and really enjoyed it only complaint is she said it seemed like a breaded and deep fried chicken breast and she wishes it was grilled chicken.For my lunch I ordered the black and blue burger. I enjoyed this one a lot except I asked for some pink in my burger and there was no pink as it was overcooked but still juicy and good.  So for 2 burgers that came with fries onions tomatoes pickle and lettuce and fried pickles and a tip we left spending roughly $23.00. My wife gave this place a thumbs up so we will be back to try some other items."}
{"text":"It's ok. It's a bar, and it's in Avon. The food is not great and the drinks are cheap. That's pretty much it. It gets kind of busy but m, it's nothing like the bars in Lakewood, Tremont, Ohio City or the flats. It's like one if the few options of bars when you live in Avon and are considering walking home. I do really like their buffalo dip though, but not the wanton crackers they give with it."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Wednesday, say at the bar. Not very busy but good crowd. I ordered boneless wings, they were the absolute worst wings in the history of wings. The breading on the chicken was so thick you couldn't find the meat inside. By far a bad choice. I can't speak for other menu items, I should have known something was up when the bartender recommended traditional wings. Lesson learned take the advice of the staff!! Maybe I give them another try with traditional wings."}
{"text":"Everyone always talks about their mac and cheese and to be fair this place does live up to its reputation with it. However when it came to the other items I tired, the crowd mushrooms they could use some work, there was a bit too much breading on the mushrooms and the dipping sauce it came with was kinda.lacklusyer when it came to flavor. Also the service could use some work, I went at a time when it was particularly busy at around 8pm, took the server forever to notice me, however once I placed my order the food and drink came fast."}
{"text":"Service is always amazing. Brian, Denise, and Rachel always treat us like we're at home. Boneless wings and bacon jalapeño Mac are to die for."}
{"text":"Good food and great selections for beer and liquor but very very slow service.  It is a cool atmosphere and clean but again slow service and the atm doesn't work"}
{"text":"Contrary to what the title of the restaurant says not everything in this restaurant is two bucks LOL but it was actually kind of surprising. We did stop in there on a rainy Monday afternoon where it appeared half a dozen regulars were busy drowning their sorrows away. Our server was also the bartender and it appeared that they were on a skeleton crew so on a couple different occasions we did have to flag her down to get her attention to place an order or get a drink refill. I had the buffalo chicken wrap which is pretty darn tasty but it was the side they got my attention. I ordered tater tots but they weren't your traditional Ore-Ida tater tots. The tater tots seem to be handmade and had a jalapeno cheese and jalapeno pieces in them, fried to a golden brown. The buffalo chicken wrap came with some sort of spicy ranch sauce which was perfect for dipping your tater tots into. I could have made a meal just out of the tater tots. Interesting side note we got to watch an elderly couple get into a drunk and fight in the bar because the 70 year old gentleman was talking to a 20 year old girl and his lady friend got upset so, dinner and a show !"}
{"text":"Rachel was AWESOME and the Meatball Mac and Cheese was AMAZING!!!!   Back again and a must stop when in Cleveland!!!"}
{"text":"I'll cut to the chase and fill in details later. This place is INCREDIBLE! We were staying in Cleveland for a show at the I-X Center and looking for a place to eat and have a few drinks, close to the hotel. We all loved the atmosphere, just walking through the door. Then we discovered their \"every hour is happy hour\" with a wide array of drinks for TWO BUCKS. Aha! Go figure! The next surprise was the selection of yummy appetizers for - you got it - TWO BUCKS! The award-winning (literally) mac & cheese dishes were worthy of a higher end restaurant. Although these weren't \"two bucks,\" they were far less expensive than I would have expected. One of the people in our party had the steak salad and it was also top-notch, made with fresh romaine and lean steak strips that were cooked perfectly. Then there's the service - extremely attentive and friendly but not overbearing. I can see us making the trek back to Cleveland just for this place but I know this will certainly be a stop every time we find ourselves in the area. GO! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ate here with the family. One of us liked her meal, the other three were far less satisfied. The good:  -My wife had the potato and kale salad with chicken, which she enjoyed very much. -Fries were fine, if nothing particularly memorable. -Service was friendly. The not-so-good:  -Both my daughter and I ordered sliders (which, while $2, can only be ordered in threes, so there's no real way to get one for $2 -- just sayin'). All 6 of them were small, quite dry, and had far too much in the bun-to-slider ratio. -Mild wings were good quality, but the mild sauce was far too spicy for our 10-year-old, and the only option to make them milder was to toss them with some ranch, according to our server. Would I go back? It's possible, but I was pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"All I can say is.... My boyfriend and I \"shared\" the Mac -n- cheese and literally fought for the last bite. Better than either of us expected!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Two Bucks with one of my friends I hadn't seen in a long time and it was a great place to catch up. I was looking for something that had reasonably priced food, and it definitely met that requirement! I had that day's special, the house burger was only $6 and it came with fries.  On the regular menu almost everything is less than $10 and they have a few things for only $2. The $2 items are small,  Such as sliders, fried pickles, fries, etc.   Certainly would come back and recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap meal in a casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"So the food I had may have been 4-star, but the atmosphere, pricing, and service definitely makes this a 5-star place for me.  I ordered a fish slider (okay), sesame chicken burger (highly recommend), and the fries (not bad). We came to have some beers and weren't looking to eat much, so there are likely better food offerings.   Our server, Alan, helped us pick some new beers which were PHENOMENAL and very reasonably priced. This is probably the best place in the area if you're looking to relax and kick back."}
{"text":"Although I do not live in Middleburg Heights, I've been to the Two Bucks there several times, mainly because of the convenient location. The basic concept is that drinks are two bucks. Well, this is and is not true--draft beer like Coors Light, Bud Light, Miller Lite ARE $2. If you want an import or craft beer, it can be up to $5 (which really isn't bad at all). From what I understand, well drinks are $2 but top-shelf stuff will cost you a little more. There is also a full menu as well as a two buck menu, which features things like sliders, fries, fried pickles, etc. The service at this location is pretty good and honestly, the food is way better than you might expect. I've had their side salad (basic, but the lettuce was crunchy and the veggies were fresh), the wings (very good), the pulled pork slider (awesome) and according to a friend who was with me one night, the mac and cheese was amazing. Great concept!!! This is my go-to place when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Well, came in here with family, just to get our nerves calm down, we were across at Southwest all weekend with a loved one. The service was spot on and friendly. The drink selection isn't to bad for the $2 deals. The atmosphere was little lacking and the karaoke was not for the faint of heart."}
{"text":"Good Grief! The barmaid is running around like it's the 50 yard dash. There's 8 people here."}
{"text":"Having a short break I figured I would call my order in a hour ahead in case they were behind, well literally a hour later I go to pick up my order and they tell me the kitchen ran out of receipt paper so they never made my order talk about upset and hungry ... well they have lost my business due to the second mess up"}
{"text":"Stopped on a Saturday afternoon. The place wasn't crowded, so we got a table right by the window. I had the Capri Salad and the Tortilla Soup. Both were very good. And very inexpensive. Going back to try the Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"This is a gem in Avon, the Macaroni and Cheese appetizer for $2.00 is so good I'd eat it for dinner every night.  Smoked gouda, scallions and penne pasta make this a great gourmet mac and cheese at a phenomenal price.  The draft beers are $2.00 even Guiness, it's hard to beat the price and the incredible service."}
{"text":"Dined there last night for the first time. They were very busy and only had two servers to cover both the bar and tables, which would explain the horribly slow service, but what made it worse was how little they seemed to care. No smile, no apology, we felt as if being there was an inconvenience to the girl who waited on us (although it was us who had to continuously wait on her). Seems like a pretty popular little neighborhood place, but I will never go back. And of course the flatbread we ordered was no longer hot by the time we got it."}
{"text":"Where to start. There is so much potential here. It makes me sad. My co-worker and I thought we had found a great lunch option. Close by, a killer steak and cheese sandwich, excellent fries, decent prices. On our second to last visit we had really great salads, a steak and blue and a steak 'wedge' salad (not sure why it was called that as it was a tossed salad, no 'wedge' in site). We went back literally the next day to get the salads again and lo and behold, everything had changed. No more $2 appetizers and all the prices were around $2 higher. Her salad came out in a whole head of Bibb, or maybe it was Boston lettuce. It looked impressive, but she had a hell of a time eating it. The core was there as well! The steak was delicious and tender as before though, so I'll give them that. I got a burger which was tasty though not cooked as well as I preferred. Too bloody for medium. The delicious fries? Not sure what happened there. I had asked for a box right off the bat knowing I couldn't finish them. (why don't restaurants offer the option of no fries with your sandwich at a cheaper price?) They were old and cold and seemed like they were frozen vs the fresh cut fries we had had  before.  The service as others have mentioned leaves little to be desired. It seems they only have one waitress to serve all the tables.      The kicker was the music. While sometimes a little too loud, it is usually excellent. Think Chili Peppers, The Verve, Collective Soul, Oasis..This time...it was Country. And I can't abide Country. I'd rather someone shoot me than make me listen to Country. It should not be an option on the jukebox. Oh, and, close the front door people. Why do I have to freeze my ass off while I'm eating my lunch?"}
{"text":"Best bar in the city..... Place reminds you of a 4 Dive bar!!! Sounds crazy, but it's true!!"}
{"text":"Ate here on a Saturday night, and the place was not very busy.  Very bar-like atmosphere, except for the Honey Boo-Boo lookalike who was throwing some sort of ball all over the restaurant.  Seated ourselves and were soon greeted by a server who took our drink and appetizer order.  Apps came out right after the drinks, which was impressive.  Onion rings (large and good), cheese curds (okay), and calamari (meh).  Small, but respectable draft beer selection, and more beers available by the bottle.  Main course was hit-and-miss.  My chicken caesar wrap was fine, and the gouda mac & cheese was interesting, but my wife's fish sandwich had some bad cole slaw on it.  She did have it sent back, and received a new sandwich, but it also had bad slaw.  Whatever...  We'll probably be back, but we'll also be searching for better dining options in Avon."}
{"text":"Food and service were outstanding. I had the Caprese Flatbread and Mom had the grilled cheese and bacon- cheddar with Pepperjack and tomato on sourdough with garlic fries- yum! High quality, generous servings, fair price."}
{"text":"Great service here! Energetic bartenders made for an enjoyable experience.  Owen and AJ took their mixology experience to the next level with fun creative new drinks!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was totally ignored. Had a seat and was totally ignored. Went to bar and was treated very rude!!!! Finally we walked out!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in there last Saturday night. The cheese curds were fantastic as always and the draft beer was the perfect temperature. My only complaint is that as a former bar manager, it is extremely unprofessional and kind of disgusting to allow employees to eat in front of their customers. Put a curtain up in the kitchen so that the public doesn't have to sit at the bar and see employees stuffing their faces thinking that it's ok because it's \"in the back\"."}
{"text":"So I have now been to this place twice. The first time with friends the second for my brothers girlfriend's birthday. The first time I remember it being pretty good and nice. The second time on the other hand it was way below par. The food was average and the place was way dumper than I remembered. The service sucked. They had 2 servers helping us, but both just simply went missing for quite a long time. I feel bad I helped choose the place for her birthday, and it was not at all what I remembered. This will probably be the last time I visit this place."}
{"text":"7 hour trip from milwaukee, Wisconsin to ohio. After a while I asked around and was told about this place.  COLT and ANDREA! Best bartenders in this whole city.  Not only did they give us ideas for GREAT drinks, they made us feel at home. AMAZING!!!  Wisconsin friends, two bucks it is"}
{"text":"Cool place if your looking for a college town bar. But you need to be willing to put up with a college age maturity level. They do have a bouncer though who kept everything cool.  Can't beat the price for drinks:)"}
{"text":"Bar that doesn't have regular wings, only boneless?? Server took order and then ignored the rest of the table who wanted to place orders. Service was lackluster."}
{"text":"Its a 4 IF You go on the right day/ night - when the service is average to good.    The BEER is Great, huge selection, unbeatable 'every day' prices, and a nice bar and very open restaurant area.  Cool place where it seems like locals and new folks can hang out comfortably.    The Food is also excellent, value wise.  Not expensive for the higher quality stuff, great fries, and the specials are great.  Ive always enjoyed the food a lot, but sometimes the service is a little slow...especially if its a slow time of day or you order from the bar.  However, if you don't mind chilling with a beer at your table - its great."}
{"text":"Terrible place the bartender Christine has an attitude, and never smiles. If you want to go to a nice bar with a nice friendly environment don't go here. Go to ramble inn plus the food is better there"}
{"text":"Awesome service with great prices. Food was well above average for a bar. Great specials on Monday and Tuesday nights too."}
{"text":"We stopped in here because it was the only place open so late on Christmas Eve. The pictures of the Mac n cheese on the yelp page really drew us in.  My companion and I made the difficult decision to start with the Buffalo Mac.  Every Mac dish sounded amazing, so deciding on one was not easy.  It was cheesy, buffalo saucy, and covered with the perfect amount of green onion and celery.  I would absolutely come back to try the other Mac options.    The beer options were pretty good, but when I asked the server for a good local IPA, he wasn't sure of their selection.   He was very nice, but he did forget a few things we asked him for and we needed to remind him.  I would skipthe onion rings.  They were virtually all batter and very spongy with little flavor.  The burger I had was good and was cooked to my liking."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Yes, it's bar food but it's good quality and fresh. We were in cleveland for work and went there 4 times! Yup, it was that good!! We ordered almost all the sliders. Go with the pull pork and sesame chicken. Also the boneless chicken wings were absolutely delicious! The Siracha one was my fav! The onion rings are ginormous but delicious. I think it's the batter they use on the fried foods that make my mouth water just thinking about it. Honestly, everything is good.  Now the service... Denise is by far the best waitress we've ever had!! The service was phenomenal! She was very professional, friendly, and personally, I think she should be running her own restaurant because the kind of service she displayed was as if she owned the place. By far made our dining experience even better. I hope she gets a raise because I was once a waiter myself so I know how hard it can be."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went to try out this local bar. Had heard good reviews.  However, we were somewhat disappointed.  If you are looking for a local bar to watch the game, this is for you and would get 5 stars.  But if you are wanting to grab a meal as well, I recommend going elsewhere.  Service wasn't that great.  Only one server in restaurant and seemed overwhelmed. No refills on drinks.  Food was bland."}
{"text":"After giving Two Bucks another try (which I am very glad I did) they without a doubt redeemed themselves. Any place will make mistakes, but I'm happy that Two Bucks took responsibility. I was happy to see how crowded this place was, especially on a Thursday night! This time I got a lime in my Landshark, not a lemon (haha) YAY :)   The sliders are a GREAT concept, perfect size and they actually fill you up!   So thank you Two Bucks, I appreciate what you have done."}
{"text":"Love this place !! This is a bar with above avg. bar food  . Mac and cheese is one of the best I have ever had. Been here over a dozen times and the food has always been spot on. The beer selection can satisfy even the most discerning taste. Only draw back is can get pretty loud for the size of location , however it is a bar."}
{"text":"Work girls happy hour.  Very reasonable prices.  Good food.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Nice Ohio based mini chain. The bar food is certainly better than average with two dollar app menu you can't go wrong. The staff is fun and are certainly very busy but still attentive. I had the buffalo cauliflower bites. They were very tasty. I also stayed for a round of trivia that was fun and kept me entertained during a business trip visit."}
{"text":"Recently visited Two Bucks for the first time and was not disappointed.  There is a substantial selection of food and drinks that are available for well below the cost of almost every available competitor.  The service was friendly but a bit less attentive than desired; The server's cell phone took priority above the customers, though I anticipate exceptions are made for regulars.  We came during an off hour, and had a pleasant time, however the jaegermeister dispenser perhaps hinted that a busier hour might be less enjoyable.  Would certainly revisit during slow times, but would likely avoid during evenings and weekends."}
{"text":"Great little gastropub! The slider options are super cute & delicious-- a great way to try several things for cheap. The Mac & cheese was amazing! Prices were very affordable- food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place really sucks. Every time I go here they mess up my order somehow. I don't know how hard it is to make a plain burger with nothing on it but apparently for them it is. So, I decided to give it one more shot and order the boneless wings for $5.50 this time so my order wouldn't get messed up. I ordered half an order and I couldn't believe it when I opened the box what they consider to be a wing! See pictures. Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place 2.5 stars if I could. Came here to meet an old friend while I was in town. This was your standard pub as far as food goes. Not quite sure I would consider it a \"gastro pub\" as there was nothing inventive on the menu. The idea of $2 for certain offerings was nice though! We tried a variation of sliders as well as fries and their fried pickles.   The sliders were okay. The mushroom and lentil slider encompassed MAYBE 50% of the bun (it was super tiny). The asian chicken slider was small as well. The only slider that was proportionate in size was the classic hamburger. The fries were seasoned well and tasty. The fried pickles were good, but they had way too much batter on them.   Overall the concept is great if you want a cheap meal, but you get what you pay for, and some of their sliders were very meek."}
{"text":"never heard of this place.. was a suggestion to go there..  found the establishment to be pretty cool ...like the layout (except see below) ...seemed clean and staff was friendly,  Food was average though.. I don't think any of the kids really ate any of their food..   and whats up with not wanting to give us ketchup?  they had to bring it out in little tiny bowels a 1/4 full..  didn't get that.. must be a money saver.. but really annoying...   Prices were reasonable but just overall the place isnt a place I think we would go back to.. food was just too average.. also, the other negative is that  the front is porch is open with a big garage door.. so people smoke out there and is floats in to where you eat...  just not into cigarette smoke while I eat.. those days are over...   I think if you are a college Kid .. or sub 25 years old .. maybe you will dig it"}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with $2 appetizers and shots. The bbq bacon slider was really good and I could eat them all day! The fried mushrooms however could have been better, since it was coated in alot of extra bread. I tried some Clevelander whiskey they had which was alright, but the price made it great. This is some place you should check out if your in the area."}
{"text":"Was here July 4th week of 2014... Was late late night... didn't have anything but soda. It was good. I'd probably go back if I was a local... but since I'm not and I was the DD that night... overall the soda was delicious."}
{"text":"It's was great bar as far as I can remember.  They have a good selection of Draft and bottled Beer.  The atmoshere is cool, seems like cool people hangout there.  Look foward to going back there."}
{"text":"Wow! Killer mac and cheese, we tried the rancher and a few sliders, everything was sooo good. And for a great price! $2 drinks and apps anytime. Absolutely recommend checking out"}
{"text":"Great food, AWESOME---SERIOUS-fan-tas-tic service.  From scratch food components, you can taste it.  Mango wings taste like frigin fresh mango.    Would not miss this when back here, love the joint!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice friendly atmosphere, especially for a small crowd late on a Wednesday night.  Local craft brews were nice, TVs large. But the (original) mac-and-cheese was really quite lame (some partly melted cheese sitting on top of tubular pasta, which were sitting upright on end in a small bowl?!?), and the fried mushrooms and buffalo chicken bite were nothing more than average. Mehhh."}
{"text":"Silly me, I've been a fan of this place ever since they opened, but didn't realize that I hadn't Yelped about it yet.  The atmosphere here is prime and the drink prices are astonishing considering you're in Avon. All day every day Happy Hour that boasts $2.00 beers which makes for a decent night out on a budget or for those looking to impress.  A lot of the food items on the menu are only $2.00 or Two Bucks.  Where else can you get a pint of Guinness for $2.00.  The employees here are GREAT!  This place is AMAZING!!!!  So refreshing to find an elegant yet relaxed bar with TOTALLY reasonable food and drink prices!  They now have an outdoor covered patio.  Keep Buckin'"}
{"text":"The good: cheese curds, Mac cheese and celeb bar.   The bad: bad service, unattractive bartenders who were doing shots and eating in view while providing bad service.    If the bartenders were better it could be a 4 or 5"}
{"text":"Two bucks was a great little happy hour stop. We tried their margherita flatbread, which was really good. We also tried their fries which were perfectly seasoned and I thought they were pretty good.  We also tried their Jefferson Mac & Cheese, which was philly cheesesteak with grilled peppers and onions and a smoked gouda cheese sauce.. It looked delicious but had a bacony type taste to it. Overall, I thought it was pretty good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Not a great place to watch sports and the crowd there is a little eh. But the food is great! It's cheap so that helps. I crave the bacon mac n cheese!"}
{"text":"I recently went here for lunch at the Middleburg Ht's location and the food was excellent. I had the Mac and Cheese with the chicken. I plan on going one night after work for some 2 buck beverages :-) think this maybe my new favorite place."}
{"text":"Came on a Wednesday night and they had a special on Mac and cheese so I got the jalapeño bacon Mac and cheese and it was delish. The guys working tonight were courteous and informative. Would visit again"}
{"text":"Two Bucks has pretty good food and decent beer prices. It's one of those places that you'll go to anytime, but you won't go out of the way to stop there. Small dining room/bar area with a covered outdoor area. Two Bucks started as a very affordable place that kept prices to a minimum. They used to have really cheap food and beer and have worked to maintain that over the years. Sliders are pretty good. Mac and cheese is a small portion but offers a ton of add-ons, which will make it pretty pricey to get what you want.  They always have affordable beer and a good selection of craft beers. Servers share tables and are always on the run, but stop in to check on you frequently. They deserve five stars for their speed and responsiveness. You are attended to without being rushed. They always have  the game on and the atmosphere is very casual.  Don't come with great expectations and you'll have an enjoyable time."}
{"text":"The wings was the worst wings I ever had no seasoning, very hard... but we did get our drinks fast that's about it"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch yesterday and had a great steak and bleu cheese salad.  Made with Romaine Lettuce, Crumbled Bleu cheese, pieces of a nice grilled steak, grilled onions and mushrooms.  A very nice fair sized salad.  The manager told me the name, Two Bucks, comes from the fact that most beers are $2 as are their selection of sliders.  He also recommends their Mac and Cheese dish, which he said was special."}
{"text":"Ok, so....Going in to this, I had the lowest expectations I could have possibly had. Between the mediocre reviews and the awful things my friend told me about this place, I thought we were doomed from the start. I can say it wasn't as bad as I feared, but it didn't blow me away either. My boyfriends sister had been here once before and picked it for my birthday dinner with his family. In all fairness to her, she remembered the place being much nicer. The leather chairs were torn apart, the floor was a mess, and the whole place was over all \"dingy\". If it was up to my boyfriend, this place would have gotten two stars. However, I believe it had some redeeming qualities.  We started with the buffalo chicken dip which was really good. Creamy and just the right amount of spicy. Plus you couldn't taste the blue cheese and that is super important to me...because I hate it with the white hot intensity of a thousand suns. Yes, that much. Next, I ordered the caprese flatbread. It was pizza. Flatbreads are usually rectangular and thin, this was round and obviously just pizza. No big deal to me since it's basically the same thing, I just thought it was humorous. What I didn't appreciate, was that it came on a small rectangular plate that curved up at the edges. So basically my PIZZA was sunken in the middle and flowing over the sides of my plate. Super messy. Also, it was below average on the tasty scale and the lack of mozzarella cheese was a serious offense in my eyes. I love cheese....  Trevor didn't care for his PIZZA either. For the life of me, I can't remember what it was called but I know it was covered in various meats. Sounds delicious, right? Wrong. The sauce was just weird. It was supposed to be a marinara sauce but I can tell you with full confidence that it was not. I don't think the others in our party minded their food, so that is a plus. For dessert, we ordered the key lime crème brulee and everyone seemed to enjoy it. It was a little runny for my taste but still good.  Over all the food wasn't terrible. Not great, but not awful. The worst part about the evening was the service. WOW. I waited twenty minutes for a refill on my water, the waitress forgot about our boxes, then brought us little ones instead of pizza boxes (which I saw them give to other customers). We had to cram our mediocre pizzas into tiny boxes....not fun. Then it took forever to get the check. I was not impressed at all.   So there you go...On a scale of 1-10  Service: 2 Food: 5 Cleanliness and over all ambiance: 3"}
{"text":"This is definitely a 20 something bar experience. It's the place to go for cheap domestic beer and cheap, frozen bar food. We ordered a few of the sliders on the menu, and they were so bad I could barely eat them, Do not order the meatball one! The Mac and cheese was so cheesy that the only way it would be good is if you'd been drinking all day and just needed something to coat your stomach. We did play trivia, which they have on Tuesday nights. We enjoyed the trivia, but it was so hard to hear over the majority of people not playing. It's a close bar, to grab a quick drink at, but it's not a place for foodies or people who enjoy craft beer!"}
{"text":"I've never eaten here, so I obviously cannot comment on the food, so otherwise I don't think there's much to say here--How can you beat $2/drink?! It was very busy when I went here, and at times the server/bartenders took an extra couple minutes checking up on us, but whatever. It was busy, and it never really became that big of a problem. What I do not like about this place was the crowd that was there hanging out....really weird and creepy people. Very interesting place to people watch. Very...."}
{"text":"I wish I could give Two Bucks three stars. I like the concept a lot. You can get a lot of food for very little money, and they get creative with some of their options. Which is cool for such a low price tag. I just wish the quality of food were just one notch higher.  What really knocked them down in my book was the inattentiveness of our servers on two separate visits.  On both nights we were attended to by a different bartender who was already completely overwhelmed by the people at his bar. On the first visit it took 20 minutes to place our order and on the second, after waiting for 40 minutes for him to bring the check we had to get up and go ask for it. Which really wasn't either of their faults.  Both bartenders were very nice and courteous. The manager needs to hire someone dedicated to the dining area.  I think if you have plenty of time to waste, and you are hanging out with friends or coworkers that you really enjoy wasting time with, go here. As long as you aren't looking for a spectacular meal, you'll be fine.   Also, I advise staying away from the wine. The first glass I ordered had gone bad and the fresh bottle didn't taste that good anyways. There are plenty of cheap cocktails that you will be much happier with ;)"}
{"text":"Got the chance to eat here for a Sunday lunch. The drinks are of course very well priced, and they were tasty as well. Our food was also excellent, especially the Mac and cheese. I have heard mixed reviews on the fries, but I myself really enjoyed them. They have herbs on them, so if that's not you're thing they won't be your favorite. There was only one server in the place, but it was really quite and he took care of several tables perfectly well. I hope to come back and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Usually,  I don't complain about places, but my husband and I used to really enjoy going here for a quick bite after work. The prices were good, and the food was decent. Tonight we stopped by, and there was a server and a bartender there, a group of six,  and another couple. We were given menus and left completely unattended for 20 minutes. We were sitting right next to the bar, while the server found other things to do. Needless to say, we walked out. What a waste of time. We won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great time. Service could have been better, but they guys bartending made up for it in a great way. Will be back."}
{"text":"I reserved the patio for a birthday celebration on a June Saturday evening and it was perfect!! It was a surprise 45th celebration and we could not have had a better time, the food was great and the service was excellent!! We never went without that's for certain. I highly recommend contacting Lily the event planner for a fun filled evening. We all (Btwn 30-40 ppl) ordered off of the menu rather than the catering option. Everything was great!!!"}
{"text":"Had the black and blue burger with fries. Food was ecellent.  Tried the daily soup as well - a bean and sausage combination.   I would ome back again"}
{"text":"This is one of the most affordable bars in the neighborhood. They have a decent collection of beers and the food is good too."}
{"text":"Nice little place great service excellent food cold drinks great prices highly recommend for good time visit this place."}
{"text":"Good food cold beer great prices, friendly staff very cool place to hangout with friends......"}
{"text":"This place is mainly what you would expect. The selection of beer and food is alright. The $2 food options are a joke, but the $2 beers are a lot of the domestics, which isn't bad. The boneless wings are turrible, they're like the chicken you get when you order sweet and sour chicken. The mac and cheese is really good, not a huge portion though. They have keno, billiards, and a couple video games which I look for in a bar. It's not a bad place to hang out and have a beer, especially for a reasonably priced night out."}
{"text":"Service is the worst in Cleveland and like all other restaurants in this location they will fail"}
{"text":"Food was average besides he Mac n cheese which was great. I believe it was $2 for any domestic draft and Guinness."}
{"text":"I liked it. Casual sports bar with a relaxed atmosphere. I didn't order any food for myself this trip, but I did sample the mac and cheese. Pretty good! Nice mix of salty, creamy gouda cheese. Gets ya ready to be served a beverage by the courteous staff. They were able to round up two tables at the last minute to seat a party of five. Was pleasantly surprised they served Rhinegeist beer!"}
{"text":"Below average. Got a steak salad. Steak was over cooked, they forgot a topping and my dressing. Had to drive back. Service is slow."}
{"text":"What's good?  Cheap food cheap drink  What's bad?  You get what u paid for  What they need to do?  Need more tv with bigger size if they wanna be a sports bar"}
{"text":"Love two bucks! The drinks are good, and obviously reasonably priced! The servers are attentive, and they have KENO! Great place to grab a drink, some appetizers or a dinner and watch the games."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here at two bucks restaurant right next to the Lake County Captains Stadium. My family and I we just sat down for an excellent meal my wife had macaroni and cheese my son had a grilled chicken wrap and I had a veggie burger with tomato basil soup. First of all the staff person name is Courtney she was friendly and welcoming  recommended the best macaroni and cheese on the menu and her opinion they have 8 different macaroni and cheese is here. All the mac and cheeses are made from scratch. I can go on more about this place. Reasonable prices, great food. And great staff."}
{"text":"A few co-workers wanted to try Two Bucks yesterday for lunch.  I joined them with my usual culinary curiosity as this restaurant is very near my place of work.  Upon arrival, we sat ourselves and the waiter took our drink orders.  Within a few short minutes, our drinks arrived and we placed our lunch orders.  I ordered the Pork Wrap with a side of fries.  When it arrived, it was warm and tasty.  It was a little bland, but since there was hot sauce on each table, I used some to spice it up.  The fries tasted like fresh cut and they were yummy.  Ironically, I only saw two items on the menu that are two bucks.  I didn't notice anything that really stood out about this place.  They have a decent selection of sliders, but the sliders are fairly small.  I realize sliders are inherently small, but these seemed small for a place that specializes in them.  I'd recommend it, but it's just 'typical'."}
{"text":"I stopped here recently when I was in Cleveland, and it was a nice find.  There's a great selection of beer, most notably Great Lakes beers.  I tried the Christmas ale, which was served with sugar and cinnamon on the glass.  There were several tasty small bites for only $2.  I had a mini pulled pork sandwich for $2 and my friend had the mac and cheese.  Both were very good.  It's nice to actually be able to order smaller portions for once.  I like it when I can pay for exactly how much I want.  I found that to be the case with the $2 food items."}
{"text":"Umm no...we walked in and after 4 minutes of standing there and nobody even acknowledging us we walked out. Easiest way to lose customers."}
{"text":"Delicious and (as the name alludes) affordable! We placed a to go order and just 15min later it was ready. I can only share a photo of the Mac n cheese the grilled chicken ceaser salad wrap and rosemary fries did not last long enough."}
{"text":"Excellent food and the price is under 10 dollars if your looking for great food at low prices this is the place. The vibe and service is awesome."}
{"text":"I'd love to give this place a two and a half stars. Came in on a Tuesday night durning an Indians playoff game, place was not overly busy. Waiting probably 20 minutes for someone to ask me for my first drink. Took awhile between drinks to get some one. After the game was over, the place pretty much emptied out, and there were probably a total of 10 people in the place, and I'm pretty sure I waited at least 30+ minutes for someone to come over to check on me, let a lone get me a drink. Most likely will never return here."}
{"text":"This has become my go-to bar to pregame, or even just to chill on a weeknight.  You can't beat the prices ($2 for almost any bottled beer or shot) and the food is pretty great bar food.    The staff is incredible and always really friendly!  They have drink specials all the time and the atmosphere is awesome.  They also have a small patio out front for these great summer nights."}
{"text":"I was really reluctant to try this place. Two dollar beers? That sounded like a recipe for lunkhead brawls and hooknasty mayhem.   Then I tasted their mac and cheese at an Avon summer festival. It was spectacular mound of creamy Gouda gooiness. So we decided to try going early on a child-free night.   It is now my go-to place for a quick, cheap, amazing dinner. They have sliders-- from portobello lentil (perfect for veggies) , to buffalo chicken to Angus burger. I haven't tried them all, but I intend to. They come in orders of 3, for two dollars a piece. The Buffalo chicken slider tastes more like a true Buffalo chicken wing than anything you could get in this town. It's perfect.   Their flat bread pizzas are loaded with cheese and great toppings. They also have an appetizer list full of homemade, battered, fried love. The staff is friendly. They generally don't have all the beers on the menu in stock-- but the menu is big enough that you are sure to find something you like. $2 Christmas Ale? I'm in.   Kids-- this place is a bar. The staff welcomes children earlier on in the evening for dinner. But yeah, this is a bar--cement floors, zinc tables, sports on the flat screen and loud music. People will be drinking. If you don't want your little snowflake seeing that sort of thing, get take out."}
{"text":"Where do I begin!  We walked in and sat at the bar. It took 10-15 mins for anyone to even acknowlege us.   We ordered an appetizer, the mac & cheese. It lacked flavor and I had to use tons of salt & pepper to make it better.  Then the entree. Everything was great until I found hair in my burger. They apologized and comp'd the meal. I then began eating my friend's fries and found hair in that too!!!  I would never visit this establishment again. Cheap food isn't worth the poor service and gross kitchen."}
{"text":"Newer place still working out some of the start up issues.  First visit took forever to get our food went back again a few weeks later and much better.  Simple bar food here, clean and nice bar with plenty of TV's if you want to watch some sports."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Thanksgiving eve. Had the Buffalo Chicken Flatbread and it was great.  Very tasty! Good beer, good music, good tv's, good bar service, clean and well kept.  This place is A++."}
{"text":"We had their amazing mac & cheese and loaded fries also the Cleveland burger and a very delicious fresh salad, highly recommend them.  Service was great and food was amazing."}
{"text":"So this was my first Two Bucks experience. I've seen them around Cleveland for the last couple of years but never felt inclined to try it out, and I'm glad I never did until now.  First off.....I have no idea why it's called Two Bucks.  If selling one slider for $2 or selling a domestic bottle of beer for $2 gives you the right to call your bar Two Bucks then they should also go by the name Waste of Time or Don't Bother.  My girlfriend ordered a Great Lakes Christmas Ale and when the bartender asked if she'd like a sugar/cinnamon rim she said \"yes\". Well I guess that at Two Bucks you only get a quarter rim. Must be Eight Bucks to get the full rim. I'm not going to get hung up on that though....that's a hard accommodation to make in any bar.....  I think the real kicker of the night was the food. I don't know who awarded Two Bucks the best Mac N Cheese in Cleveland but I'd love to find out the other \"awards\" they've handed out so I can be sure to avoid those places in the future. I find in EXTREMELY ironic that a place called Two Bucks is trying to serve artisan food. My Mac N Cheese was 9 noodles with half a slice of steak, 1.5 pepper slices and the most miniscule amount of cheese ever. It was $9.00. My gf got the veggie (primarily lettuce and onion wrap) and ate half and had enough.  My one star review isn't because of the quality of my experience.....I wasnt expecting a lot going in. It's one star because I can't wrap my head around how a place who's entire style is about a a cheap night out is trying to be high society. If you want to drink bud light all night for cheap then please go drink your little heart out. This is right up your alley. But if you're looking for anything else (including \"award winning\" Mac N Cheese) then you need to find another place.   I'll take my Two Bucks somewhere else, thank you. This place should be called Two Sucks. That's my zinger of the night!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Tuesday evening when we were in the area. It was clean, and inviting as we walked in. We sat at the bar and it didn't take long before the bartender greeted us. When we said we hadn't been before, he let us know about the $2 spirits and the specials. He ended up making us something he had mixed up, and it was delicious. He was very friendly and we had a good time chatting with him and the other bartenders. We enjoyed the drinks, the Tator tots, and our experience. Tuesday was trivia night, and that was fun. We ended up having a very good time. I would recommend it, and suggest you ask Cole to mix you his special pink drink."}
{"text":"Nice lunch.  Our party had several Mac and cheese orders, tomato basil salad several burgers and one kids flatbread pizza.  Burgers and Mac n cheese were great , as was the salad.pizza was not so great, soggy with an odd sauce taste.  Service was good, fast and efficient and attentive."}
{"text":"Met a friend for dinner on a week night. Wasn't super crowded, server was really attentive and the food was great. Had the veggie burger and it was one of the best homemade ones I've ever had."}
{"text":"Came here specifically for the burgers with gluten free buns, only to learn they were discontinued two months ago. Even the wings are breaded, and I ended up with a salad, which I can get anywhere. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with excellent beer choices and prices. All of the food looked amazing, especially the mac n cheeze options. The rest of the menu showcased standard bar fare choices but the food quality is definitely uspcaled."}
{"text":"Two Bucks is a fun place to hangout with friends and order a bunch of really delicious food.  I've been here several times now, and each time I go, I am always impressed.  I usually get their medium buffalo wings, but I've also tried a few of their Mac and cheeses.  Their selection of Mac and cheese is amazing!  The original is amazing, the BBQ pork Mac and cheese is out of this world, and the pizza Mac and cheese is delicious!  I want to try the buffalo and jalapeño because I love spicy food!  They have a great selection of $2 appetizers and a full bar, which is great.  I highly recommend their Bloody Mary!  It is super yummy!  I ordered a tequila sunrise, but it was a lot more orange juice than I would have liked, it sort of drowned out the taste of the tequila.  I'm not saying I want a lot of tequila, but I felt like I was drinking straight up orange juice and grenadine.  I highly recommend Two Bucks!  The service is amazing and the food is outstanding.  I'I actually want to go to two bucks just from writing this review!"}
{"text":"For Lorain county this is one of the better bar options. But oh gosh, it needs some help when it comes to service. Over the multitude of times I've been here the service has fluctuated from very bad to great. It's so random--and doesn't seem to have anything to do with the time of day you're there. Not sure what's going on, but it's definitely a turn off.   The food is good for bar food. Though I don't like the mac and cheese. It's way too mild and the chicken has been cooked to death. I do like their flat breads though. If I go back I plan on trying some other stuff too.  The booze is about what you'd expect for a place called two bucks. The drinks are very cheap but it's deceptive. The amount of alcohol in those drinks is not very high. You would need to have 2 or 3 of them to get to the same level of alcohol that you'd have in a regular priced drink at another bar. So then, it's not really two bucks is it? :)   However--if you're just looking to chill and hang out and enjoy the sipping of drinks more then the 'getting drunk' part then this place can be pretty cool."}
{"text":"Most of He food is good, the mac and cheese is awesome. Service is good and everything is reasonably priced. Only thing I don't like here is the brunch menu. Food came out cold like it was under a heat lamp and not recently cooked. Everything else is always good, just not brunch."}
{"text":"Two Bucks...seriously one of the best places I've found in a long time! My friend's mom recommended this place, and we didn't regret taking her advice.   They not only have a great beer list, especially craft, but they have a full bar. Everything is super cheap! Craft beers were between $4-5 and shots were $2. They have a good bar menu, with $2 appetizers (see the theme?). My friend and I split the mac and cheese and fried mushrooms. The mac and cheese was very good, and was presented like we were at a fancy dining restaurant. The fried mushrooms were HUGE, and the dipping sauce was awesome.  Not to mention our waiter was very friendly and gave us drink suggestions and came around frequently.  The value for the drinks and the quality of food is what sold me! How many \"cheap\" places have you been to that give you crap? Not here. You get great service and value for your buck. You can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night. We used to come here all the time when it was Beef o Brady's. All of the standard bottled beers are 2 bucks. Ordered the buffalo chicken dip. The chips are made fresh and the dip was excellent. The bartenders are very attentive. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"They just opened this one right down the street from my house. How could you go wrong with $2 almost anything!? Great place to watch a game or hangout with friends. Bartenders have been extremely nice. We got boneless wings and a flatbread to eat...both were amazing! The boneless wings are huge and the flatbread was very flavorful. This will be a frequent hangout for us! You can't beat a place that you can drink good and eat good for next to nothing."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Every visit is phenomenal!! From the prompt and friendly service, to the yummy food, and the awesome selection of drinks! In comparison to other local bars, two bucks menu is delicious and nicely done! Salads are always presented beautifully, the freshest ingredients are used, the sliders are delish (I had the cheeseburger, fish, and steak and peppercorn sauce) and the creme brulee is to die for!!! I want to go back for the pumpkin creme brulee while it lasts!!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't really feeling going out tonight, but was really feeling bar food so we used Uber eats to get take out. With that being said the food had good presentation, although everything but our fries was over cooked. Burgers ordered rare were well done(buns dry as well), wings were over cooked, and pretzel bites were hard. Honestly if the food was cooked properly I think it would have been really good though. Overall wouldn't get take out again"}
{"text":"Ruben TATER tots awesome! Drink and ear cheap! Good service! Great place to go when $ is short!"}
