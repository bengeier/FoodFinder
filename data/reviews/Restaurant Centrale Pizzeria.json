{"text":"Close to my house.  Enjoyed it.  I really don't like fancy pizza that we have nowadays.  It is sort of old school so big plus."}
{"text":"A friend of mine put me on to this place after telling me that it was rated by CTV as the best pizzeria in Montreal. In my opinion it is certainly worth the trip to Lasalle. This is an old shcool pizza joint, selling an old school style pizza. The crust is chewy and tasty, loaded with toppings and cheese. Everything that you want in a pizza! Head on down to Lasalle to give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Beloved pizza joint. Come to this tiny restaurant and enjoy friendly service and thick-cheesed-old school tossed pizza."}
{"text":"Very, very, very good old school pizza. We really enjoyed our pizza's here. French fries are very nice and crunchy.  Service is top notch. Really felt like I was back in time. Great service, and fantastic, cheesy gooey pizza. Don't miss it! Plenty of street parking available."}
{"text":"Still a great pizza. Be prepared to order extra cheese and or extra pepperoni if you want that old-school Montreal pizza.  I have tried others, and I always comeback."}
{"text":"Central' Pizza is by far the best pizza in Montreal. So succulent and tasty! You could just sit and drool at the smell of their pizza. If your a tourist or a local this is the pizza place to go. You won't regret it."}
