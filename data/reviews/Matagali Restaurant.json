{"text":"Yum!  I found this resto using Yelp, and I am glad I did.  The butter chicken was very flavourful and the chunks of white meat were juicy.  I ordered a garlic naan on the advice if a Yelp reviewer, and I certainly enjoyed it more than I would have an order of rice.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went in to this little Asian cuisine with great excitement and expectation, but I kinda okay with their service and food. I went with my friends and had started with CHICKEN SPRING ROLLS, PRAN PAKORA then had CHICKEN MASALA with rice and green salad Starters were lovely, but the main course was honestly not good. Not so great compared to lots of other Asian cuisines around there. HTH, Thanks"}
{"text":"Their butter chicken is delish..best in the city."}
{"text":"I walked by this place for many years before trying it because it seemed like a hole in the wall and I could never tell what the hours of operation were.  The atmosphere may not win you over due to its dim basement location, but trust me, the food definitely will get your attention and keep you coming back.  I do not often eat Indian food (due to lack of exposure to good places and too many buffet experiences), so I am no expert.  However, I quite enjoy the food here.  The naan is crispy and chewy, great accompaniment to the curries, which are appropriately thick and flavourful (they can do mild if you can't do spicy).  The prawn pakora is crispy and perfectly paired with the mint chutney sauce that tastes amazing.  The chicken tikka is moist without being mushy and goes great with the yoghurt sauce.  I have tried the following mains (not all in one sitting): lamb vindaloo, madras fish curry, fish masala, prawns goa curry, lamb rogan josh, butter chicken, chicken masala and chicken tikka.  All tasted good, hearty and delicious.  Dessert-wise, I have tried the ras malai and the gulab jamun; both had balanced flavours without over sweetness.  If you order the main items during lunch, the dishes come with a salad or you can substitute for naan.  However, salad/naan is not included with the dinner items, you will have to order those separately.  This place is a good deal for Summer/Winterlicious.  My main problem with this place is that the business hours seem to change without any sort of reliable schedule (e.g. summer/winter hours?).  Their menu states they are open Mon-Fri for lunch 11:30am-5pm and then dinner on Mon-Sat 5pm-10pm.  However, when I called them on a Sat night to order takeout, their voicemail greeting said they are not open for dinner on Fri, Sat or Sun.  I don't know if it is due to summer hours because the last time I called and got the voicemail greeting, they followed the menu hours.  I wish they had a more obvious schedule so I won't be disappointed when I crave their food only to discover they are closed.  Definitely call ahead to see if they are open before going."}
{"text":"Solid place for Indian food.  A little on the expensive side, but justified by quality and taste. Got the Butter chicken lunch for take out. $12 +tax includes rice and salad (or you can subsitute with naan). Naan is good. Fresh, warm, and has just the right texture. Generous tandoori chicken breast pieces, moist. Sauce is tasty, good flavour, but would have like a bit more of it. Would definitely come back the next time I get a craving for Indian food."}
{"text":"Went with my wife the week before the Labour Day weekend for an early dinner.  Just a couple of other guests in the restaurant so our service was very fast and  efficient.  We started with the Prawns Pakora.  Really liked the Mint Tamarind Chutney dipping sauce that came with it and even saved it to use for the main course.  We both had the Butter Chicken.  It was delicious with large chunks of moist chicken served in a creamy, buttery sauce that tasted great without the overdone curry flavour that seems to find its way into every dish in all of the cheap Indian places throughout Toronto whether you ordered a curry dish or not.  The Basmati rice it came with was nice and light and that's where I used the Tamarind Chutney when the butter cream sauce was finished.  It also came with a nice Thai salad which was incredibly fresh and crisp.  So why can't some of the bigger, richer restaurants and chains in this city ensure that their salads are this good?  The place is licensed so I had a Kingfisher beer and my wife had an apple Cider and they went very well with the meal.  Some reviews complain about the service, but ours was quick and efficient.  Our server was actually a little girl of 8 or 9 with an older lady behind her (grandmother?) to make sure she got it right and she did.  A fresh, delicious Indian meal for an affordable price (around $50) in downtown Toronto was a real treat and we will definitely be back to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Matagali is an easy-to-miss Indian restaurant, tucked into a basement in a rather undeveloped side street just off Bay. They apparently do a lot of business with the staffs of the big local institutions around, such as hospitals like Sick Kids and even the AGO.  They used to be closed (inexplicably) for lunch, but the hours have improved, which is certainly good. Service was a bit on the slow side when I was last here, but once the food arrived, all was well. While Matagali does Thai food too, word is the Indian cuisine is better, and the Butter Chicken I had was quite tasty."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Went there on a groupon deal and would definitely come back. Great service and friendly staff. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"EXTREMELY trans-phobic.  I cannot remember the last time I was treated as rudely (by anyone!) as I was treated by the server last time I was at this restaurant.  In downtown Toronto, no less...  I asked the server to stop calling me (together with my friend) as \"gentlemen\" and he told me to stop telling him what to do and he will call me whatever the hell he feels like.  When I told him that he was being ridiculously sexist he said that if I don't like it I am welcome not to come back.  My jaw almost hit the floor.  Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Just tried this place tonight and I love it! Went with some \"standard\" choices- butter chicken, garlic naan, and veggie pakoras.  Everything was way above par.  I've never had such delicious butter chicken.  Hoping to branch out the next time and order some more unique dishes.  I ordered takeout but when I picked it up got a chance to check out the inside- its cute- definitely a great place to go with friends, family or a date!  I live around the corner so I'm looking forward to my next craving for Indian food."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and this place beats anything I have in my neighborhood here. Ate here twice during SMX Toronto 2010 at night. Very chill, laid back service. Not a place to eat if you are in a hurry. But the food here is wonderful and highly flavorful! Great stuff."}
{"text":"This is the second time I visited the restaurant. My friend and I went last year and were in the area again. The food and service were just as great as I had remembered the first time.   We seemed to have arrived during a slump. They were switching servers and kitchen staff. Regardless our food was quick and flavourful.  We ordered the dinner special for $25.00. It was enough to share amongst two people.   It is also a great date night venue. Small and intimate. Will return in the future."}
{"text":"I always enjoy visiting this simple but fabulous restaurant, and very much enjoy the home-cooked-style food here. Even though it may not be completely authentic Indian/Thai, it is certainly 100% tasty. I have visited here at least 5 times, and have had the soup of the day (lentil/dahl), which was fantastic, as well as the channa masala (chickpea curry), dahl (lentil curry), and vegetable pud thai. I love the atmosphere here - it's quiet and intimate. Don't be intimidated in the least by the low budget decor (although inside of restaurant is newly renovated, well-maintained, and super clean) and the outside of the restaurant, which looks unappealing - stairs down to a half-basement (the decor is the only reason I gave the review one less star). You will almost certainly be impressed, once you get into the restaurant, at how the food here is better quality, healthier, and a lot cheaper than the other restaurants on Elm (near Yonge Street, only a block away). The staff here are always lovely. While you might not take a date here if you want to impress them with a super fancy expensive gourmet restaurant, it's a perfect spot for a couple who want to simply enjoy a delicious meal and some wine together in a quiet soothing spot, (in the centre of but still protected) away from the hectic bustle of downtown."}
{"text":"Good service. Was pretty quick too. The food was well priced and in generous portions and most importantly delicious, not the best Indian food I've had but pretty good."}
{"text":"Very good! Went today and had the chicken vindaloo; it was very spicy. I normally don't like salad much either, but the salad had a nice sauce and was easy to eat (they gave a lot though). Portions-wise, in regards to the main dish itself, they gave a lot of sauce and an okay amount of chicken and potatoes. Rice portion was actually pretty small (less than the other places i've been to). It's about the size of a tiny rectangle? However, food was very nice and I got a complimentary samosa! :D I will definitely be coming back to try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Excellent! We were a group of 6 for dinner.  Food was delicious -everything we got was great.  They are able to tailor the spice level.  Service was great.  Wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Had Pakora, Tandoori Chicken, Cashew Chicken and Butter Chicken. Indian fare good but Thai Cashew Chicken didn't match expectations. Overall timely service and quality food."}
{"text":"This small place was quiet on a Thursday night. There's about 30 seats and only a few other people there besides myself. Service was quick but unrushed, and the food was great. There was some enjoyably mild tabla music playing softly in the background.  I was brought something that resembles a crunchy Indian taco shell, which was mildly spicy and very light. I ordered a tofu dish with fried vegetables, some rice and some garlic naan. Add a ginger ale and tax and the price was just over $21. But the issue was not that the price was too high for a dinner for one, but I ordered too much food. I ended up not finishing some of the naan, and barely made it through my great tasting entree. The herbed naan was marvelous, I really wanted to eat it all. The entree was served so hot it almost burnt my tongue, which is how I like it."}
{"text":"I'm sure this place has changed ownership. There used to be (years ago) 2 woman that seemed very invested in the restaurant. Was very cute and the Indian food was spectacular (very fine ingredients). My last visit was mediocre. It was a combination of Thai and Indian and not of the original quality. The new version may be a better option for the lunch crowd coming from Sick kids but not as much of a go-to destination for dinner."}
{"text":"This is a Chinese stab at Indian cooking. Vegetable pakoras were pretty good, but my friend's basil tofu and my chicken masala were closer to Thai than any Indian we've ever sampled. Like every other cookery Chinese folks try to undertake, the ingredients are all there, but it just doesn't taste like the real thing.  High marks to the waitress who was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Bottom line: Food's good, but takes forever to arrive.  Longest Indian restaurant meal in TO, hands down.  I'd go back if I have time on my hands.  We got our pakoras appetizers really quick.  Then, it was an epic saga to get our mains.  Shortly after 8pm: Ordered 8:15: Pakoras 9:15: Mains (we were falling asleep waiting) 9:30: Bill and gulab jamun to go  Food was really good though.  For the price, the portions were smaller than other restaurants, so, you're paying a premium.  That said, we tasted the goodness of the food being made fresh."}
{"text":"Got the Chicken Masala for 14 dollars before taxes. Taste okay, services were friendly, but I basically got a small bowl of a few small pieces of chicken and some sauce for ~16 dollars after taxes (did not come with rice). Actual chicken portion size looked like it was for an infant. If I had paid 8 dollars for this at a food court, it still would have been too expensive.  Quality:6/10. Service:8/10. Value: 1/10. Overall: 2.5/10 (not an average)"}
{"text":"Three of us today for Summerlicious.    We all ordered different appetizers. Veggie, chicken samosas with mild spicy tamarind sauce and spring rolls were delicious.    I couldn't decide but finally ordered the Goa Pawns which were good but not as yummy as my favourite Butter Chicken!    I also ordered a side of naan.      My buddies enjoyed their meals of Butter Chicken and Madras Curry Fish with naan.   I love the Thai salad that is included with the meals.    Lastly we all ordered Rasmalai which balanced out the meal.   We were all satisfied with bellies full.    Awesome visit again !"}
{"text":"I'm updating this because the owner called me. I'm not sure how he got my number ?!! Yelp? I gave him an extra  for customer service. Anyways, I like that he cares enough to call and is concerned with my less than average rating. He informed me he is still the original owner 15 years it's been. And of course the menu has changed but the navrattran korma which would also be the butter chicken that I had years ago (which was the BEST) is no longer. Disappointing yes..but the fixed price menu I keep reading about might be worth checking out.it is a great deal for $25 as I remember the restaurant had a higher price point but then I got better quality for it! Lol I feel I should try it again and try a few more dishes.  And give them another chance"}
{"text":"A big disappointment..felt the place would be great  (based on reviews) but NO..food was just OK..weird mix of Indian n Chinese... place was small and quiet but nothing great or good about it. Not going back if possible.."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and it wasn't terribly busy (except for a birthday bash that was going on). It's located in the basement area, smell, but well-kept.   Our waitress was fairly attentive and very sweet. The food didn't take too long and we were given complimentary papdum as an appetizer. Fairly decent, nothing to complain about when it comes to free food(ish). My date got the Lamb Vindaloo and I got the Fish Masala. The fish masala had enough sauce that it balanced out the fairly bland flavour of tilapia, but the lamb vindaloo was better. Though to be honest, I did find that the sauces were a little bit bland compared to what I've had before and maybe could've used a bit more salt. Portions are kind of small and I've paid less for way more (and better tasting). Naan was a-okay though!   Would I come back? Eh, maybe... though probs not. If I do, I'd probably would order more well-known Indian staples next time and see."}
{"text":"cute place - sort of in a basement nook, nice romantic mood light, and not too crowded.  vegetable samosa - awsome! chana masala with naan - pretty awesome as well. very flavorful and finger licking good. fish pakora - nope. the fish quality is good, big fresh pieces but it's not marinated or dressed properly. in other words, tasteless. it's like fish and chips, minus the chips and tartare sauce - weird stuff.   may come and try something else. wont get fish pakora again tho."}
{"text":"This is an underrated restaurant - I'd give it 8 out of 5 stars if I could. The food is incredibly flavourful, the service excellent and the ambience perfect for a date night, random get together or family dinner. I have eaten at over 40 different Indian restaurants and am of South Asian descent and this place has the most delicious curries, breads, fresh rice, and desserts. I have been 5-6 times and will be visiting again this Saturday. As an aside, my husband is Canadian and loves Indian food however he finds it to be oily in most places (I agree). The food here is made with far less oil so it doesn't do a number on your stomach. See for yourself!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just tried to order food for pick up and guy was so unbelievably rude it was shocking. I tried to order a fish dish but didn't have Indian name memorized so I tried to describe and he was so mean and insulting and stupid. Never ever eat here. Wow."}
{"text":"My friend and I found this place as a small hole-in-the-wall type of restaurant. We were the only ones in the restaurant so service was not an issue. It took some time to get our food but I felt the meals were freshly cooked and tasted great! Overall they have great food, but if you're wanting to be in the midst of people this wouldn't be the place for that. I would definitely opt for the take out however. I believe the signature dish is the lamb curry and the portion sizes were quite filling."}
{"text":"Again I'm super impressed with this place! I enjoyed their winterlicious menu. Their curries are delicious, and their pakora was some of the tastiest I've ever had (although they don't look like traditional pakora). Their gulab jamun was also perfect and not too sweet, as was their Mango lassi. The ambiance isn't anything special but I really really enjoyed the food here and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came here after craving some Indian food and yelping for some restaurants nearby. The place is cute and quaint, down some steps right off Bay and Elm. Even though it was a Friday evening, it wasn't too busy, and we easily got a table.   We ordered a delicious mango lassii to share, the garlic naan, which comes in a good portion (unlike some other places I've been to), some rice, the butter chicken and the lamb rogan josh. The lamb was okay, but not a favourite - just spicy with not too much interesting flavour. The butter chicken, however, was splendid. We did not try any of the Thai dishes.   Would definitely recommend trying this little place - it might just hit the spot if you're craving some quick and not too pricey Indian food."}
{"text":"This establishment was recommended to me by several complete strangers, so one rainy evening three of us descended into Matagali.   A few plates of various curries, rice and delicious garlic naan later we were full and very happy. The service was quick and pleasant and the price quite reasonable for a downtown joint, around 15 per person which included a cold beer each.  What I liked best was the intimate setting, which was reminiscent of a similar Indian restaurant I used to frequent in Montreal. These downstairs locations, when done well, are just plain cozy.  All in all, it's the best kind of place to hide out from the rain."}
{"text":"Steps down from street level take you to a small hidden gem of a restaurant.  Good food and decent (not great) service. Ordered the lamb vindaloo and it was spicy but not extremely hot like some authentic indian restaurants will serve."}
{"text":"Had such a great meal at this little Indian restaurant! Although the description says Indian and Thai I would stick with the Indian dishes. We started with Pakoras, Samosas and and Spring Rolls - Pakoras were awesome and would definitely order again but would always pass on the spring rolls.   As for mains, I ordered the Eggplant Bharta and Chana Masala with no added dairy since I'm intolerant. They were happy to make changes for allergies :) Both dishes were delicious with the plain basmati rice. The rest of my table ordered the Garlic Naan and really enjoyed it also.   Service was slow but to be expected since they make each dish to order. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but the food is just too bland.  Pros: -Very friendly service: Our waiter was very attentive, and a cute little girl (presumably the owner's daughter) even helped with our order. -Cozy, relaxing atmosphere: It's in a semi-basement, but that's not a problem once you're inside. -Good location.  Con: -Bland food: With Indian and Thai being two of the most flavourful cuisines in the world, you'd think this place would be tasty. It wasn't. We ordered the Basil Tofu (on the recommendation of the waiter) and the Dhal Maharani. The place was almost empty, and the food still took a long time to make, which we didn't mind, but we were expecting it to be good. Unfortunately, both dishes were dull and flavourless. I'm sure it was made to order, but it didn't taste very fresh either. And the naan had the stiff texture and taste of store-bought naan.  With an improvement to the cooking, this could be a really great place."}
{"text":"This place is just down the street from work so I'm here all the time. I was initially introduced to it from people at work who claim it's the best Indian food they've ever had, and I must say I have to agree with them!   My favourites on the menu are the prawns goa curry and cashew chicken. Sooooooooo good. Definitely 5 star dishes. The spicy salad that comes with the lunch special is so good. I love the dressing.  My co-worker and I were trying to figure out what's in it and we think they use flat sprite (the pop) and chili flakes. Sounds strange but it works!! Their mango juice is also very good, so are their samosas.  And my vegan co-worker loves the basil tofu, just make sure ask for no fish sauce with it.   Service is efficient and the woman who works there has gotten to know me over the years. The atmosphere is a little dark, but it's located underground so not much they can do about that. They've done their best with the space though. One tip: make sure you're not in a hurry if you're eating here. They're notorious for taking a long time for food since each dish is made from scratch, especially if you're with a large group, so plan your time accordingly.   The only reason why I am not giving 5 stars is because, sadly, I can't afford to eat here every day!! They're a little on the pricey side...even for the lunch specials."}
{"text":"\"Indian or Thai? Which is it? The service was awkward and left a lot to be desired which can also be true of the food\"  So I had to come here from the aid kids hospital across the street. I thought having a closer to home cooked meal would make staying at sick kids a little easier. It was and it wasn't. It was in the sense that there was good, it wasn't in the sense that everything else was odd and not great.   The atmosphere isn't bad. It's actually nice and cozy and quaint in a basement style entrance.   Service  This is whee my big gripe comes from in that the waitress had no idea what she was doing. It's like she was high. Didn't know the menu or the specials couldn't articulate anything or take an order properly. It was awkward. She misquoted the specials several times and had to keep coming back to our table to confirm things. She then did that with another couple who came in for a meal. The couple even said to her \"let's start again, pretend we just got here, how does the special and menu work?\" very awkward and kind of ruins the experience.   Food  Not bad. Not amazing, but not bad. It kinda tasted like it came out of a jar, but it was presented okay. They have a $25 special with small portions of 4 mains plus rice and a few Appetizers. The fried stuff was over fried and oily, but the subji or main courses were okay. Nothing to write home about and definitely something I'd ever crave or want again.   Summary. It's not a bad ethnic option close to the hospital, but the best on centre and young street is just minutes away and is worth the extra walk."}
{"text":"Quiet and cozy little place with a great Winterlicious menu. The chicken samosas were interesting, but tasty. Butter chicken was about 3/5 so certainly not the best in the city but still quite flavourful.  Ras malai to finish was not too sweet and the milky sauce was very well done."}
{"text":"Close to hospital row, this restaurant is hidden underneath a few run-down looking houses on Elm St. This restaurant serves both Indian & Thai cuisine. I had the curry with tilapia. It was amazing. The tandoori chicken is suggested as well. Service there was very good, and the price is quite cheap as well."}
{"text":"This is a cute hole in the wall Thai/Indian restaurant is definitely a must-go to when you're in this \"hospital\" area.  Located near Sick Kids, this tiny restaurant serves a variety of traditional Indian dishes and some Thai food as well.    My favourite dishes are the paneer and butter chicken.  The service is always great and the chef always has a little treat for us, whether it be papadum or samosas.  The paneer is actually cooked right and the cheese is a good texture.  My boyfriend did order their pad thai once and unfortunately, we weren't a fan of that so we'll stick with Indian food here.   Definitely a must-try for this local small business!"}
{"text":"A craving for Indian food and the abundance of good reviews brought us to Matagali for dinner. The restaurant did not live up to the reviews; at most I would say it deserves 2.5 stars. Given that it's not an option I'll have to go with 2. Upon arrival we were surprised to learn that the restaurant was the basement of the building, this nearly scared both my companion and I away. However, after a long day searching for a decent Indian restaurant in downtown Toronto wasn't an option. Though it was nearly vacant at the time of our arrival, several people arrived midway through our meal. The atmosphere was casual but pleasant, perfect for two students long to unwinding.  The service was good. Our waitress was helpful, patient, and kind. The service time wasn't bad either.  On the other hand the food was no where what the reviews made it out to being. We order three dishes. The Butter Chicken which the reviews rave, and our waitress called their speciality, and yes,  this one dish was good, but it all goes downhill from there. A Chicken Masala tasted like it was drenched in a slightly spiced barbecue sauce and our Aloo Peas Pilau like it had been bathed in a bucket of mint before being served. Having eaten South-Asian food all my life I know when the flavors aren't right, here they weren't right. It's a miss for me when a restaurant can only serve me one good dish. Benefit of the doubt, maybe the chef had a bad day, or maybe it's only those two dish that are terrible. I won't be going back to find out."}
{"text":"Good service and accommodating to gluten-free diners, but I'm not quite sold on the majority of dishes here. I visited during Winterlicious and most of what we ordered was okay, but nothing was standout or exceptional. If you're in the area, it might be worth checking out, but I'm not sure it's a \"destination\" restaurant. I preferred the Indian dishes, but mostly because I didn't feel like mixing it up."}
{"text":"When we went, they had a special for butter chicken + channa masala ($19) and a prix fixe menu (2 each of 2 set appetizers, 3 dishes of your choice and a pair of gulab jamun for $25).  We were quite satisfied with the butter chicken. My favourite was the lamb jalfrezi and the massaman kai curry. The fish curry we were not so hot on. Of course, there were enough portions to bring home for lunch the following day and they even gave us extra na'an. The garlic na'an is worth the $1 upgrade.  For the entire meal, we were the only ones in the restaurant over dinnertime, which I thought was odd. Of course, that meant super attentive service by the waiter.  WiFi password is mangolassi"}
{"text":"Nice people is the best thing about this place.  Sadly the butter chicken was too sweet, the Lamb Roganjosh was spiced unlike any I have had before, and not in a good way.  The eggplant dish was okay but very mushy like a dip.  Naan was burnt and had an off herb taste.  Rice was jasmine not basmati as ordered.    Confetti candy that usually takes like black licorice ended up tasting like flowery soap.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"We were plumb exhausted by the time we got to our hotel and had to cancel a reservation across town in favor of something closer to our hotel.  This was a good choice.   The food was tasty although calling the place Indian and Thai is a bit of an exaggeration. The Indian food was quite predominant on the menu.  The prawns pakora was a particularly interesting dish - more a breaded marinated shrimp dish than a pakora, there is a photo here http://paulalanlevy.blogspot.com/2012/10/flying-up-to-toronto-to-see-dc-united.html I also enjoyed the onion kulcha, fish masala and although I am no fan of eggplant, my wife liked her eggplant bharta"}
{"text":"This is definitely a great place to go if you want some butter chicken and know nothing about Indian or Thai food. I guess my expectations were too high.  We order d the Fish Masala and the Dhal. They were both alright. You can tell that the ingredients weren't very fresh. The fish dish was definitely from frozen and thrown in at the end. The dhal was creamy, but not in a good way. The chicken kulcha that we ordered as an appetizer was pretty good though.  The service was great though. The people who work there are extra nice, but I don't think it's enough for us to go back."}
{"text":"Once again, we were extremely pleased with our experience at Matagali. The decor has been updated and looks great. The food, as mentioned in my previous review, remains top-notch. The $25 dinner special is still the best way to sample a variety of very fresh, flavorful cuisine. Of particular note was our new server, Michael, who provided us with some of the best service we've ever experienced - personable, humorous, and professional. It's clear that he enjoys what he does. Can't wait for our next visit!"}
