{"text":"I've been to a lot of pho places, this place charge $6 for a big size special pho noodle, fresh side dishes and best hit chilli, give it a shot"}
{"text":"We are super picky about our Pho. 

We decided to try this restaurant and it's so far - the best we have had in the city! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It's a great quick place to eat! I work in this area and not much so this is healthy, quick and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My go to Vietnamese food spot in the area. Very quick service and the food is always delicious. BÃºn with grilled pork and spring roll, or Rare beer Ph are my favourites."}
{"text":"I live right near keele and Sheppard and I always go to this place. I was hesitant at first because I'm very picky about my pho but the pho here is on par with all the other top places like pho saigon and pho hung. The price for a large is on average 2$ cheaper than the competition. They provide you with hot raw peppers.. something pho saigon does not. Their grilled chicken and pork chop with rice is my 2nd go to meal and I love it as well. You won't be disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"Lucky me!  Today, one of my best friends (who now resides in the wonderful city of Chicago) dropped into Toronto for a surprise visit.  He had some business to take care of in mid-town, so we Yelp'd for some Vietnamese in the area (Keele and Sheppard -- errr...??).

Pho Mi King came up (it's actually called Pho Huong Trang now).  Amongst a world of Kelsey's and East Side Mario's, anything ethnical was a sight for sore eyes. We strolled over.

For me, most Viet places get a standard 3 or 4 stars.  I mean, it's pretty difficult to mess up Pho and Vermicelli, no?

Pho Huong Trang makes some pretty lame cold rolls (they didn't hit you with that refreshing feeling you generally get), there was no coriander in ANY of the dishes we ordered, and to add insult to injury, the green tea was barely lukewarm -- that's just offside! 

Now, I had prepared myself for the perils of Viet food outside of the downtown core, but this was overly disappointing.  I'm still happy we chose Pho Huong Trang vs. the Pizza Pizza next door, but still.  It's hard not to be critical.

Ah so it go!  Still had a great time catching up with my homie :)"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants in the city. Has that authentic Vietnamese taste to their pho and their spring rolls. Pho and Spring Rolls are generally the two things I try to tell if I like a Vietnamese restaurant and this place does both of them well. They also do the freshly squeeze lime drink on ice that I love o so much. After dating a Vietnamese girl for 4 years and being away from home this is the closest thing to being back at their place that I'm going to get.

Not the cleanest place but nonetheless not unbearable either. Quiet staff. Sometimes forget about something you ordered and need to be reminded. But the food makes up for it all.

Try it if your in the area."}
{"text":"Their Pho is quite nice. Very reasonable prices. Would highly recommend to my friends :)"}
{"text":"I have come back since and their attitude was much better. Perhaps it was an off day the time I went but now I don't mind coming back to this joint. It might have also just been a language barrier. Food is very good though and service is acceptable for a viet joint."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this is close to my home. My Gent & I like to sneak away for quick lunch dates in the afternoons. Delicious food and quick service for a very reasonable price. 

They have fish in the aquarium again too! 

And CP24 on always, so you're up on the news while enjoying your Pho"}
{"text":"The pho here is decent, nothing to amazing. On weekdays they close at 10pm so it's great for you if you have a long day at work. I don't normally come here for pho because I feel like my mom can make something similar. I would highly recommend their spring rolls though. They're freshly made and very crispy. Also would recommend getting their sinh to bo which is their avocado shake, very creamy and thick."}
{"text":"I have tried most Vietnamese restaurants in this area. I am sorry but I think this is the worst one. 

In terms of the ambience, it is like the other restaurants in the area. However, the prices are higher, and the portions are a lot smaller. 

Food: I ordered pork chop with steamed egg on rice. This is my usual dish whenever I am trying out a Vietnamese restaurant for the first time. I use this dish as my comparison. My first impression of the dish was that the portion was soooo small compared to others in the area. The pork chop was SO THIN.

Overall: The food was mediocre and the portion is a lot smaller compared to its competitors in the area. Prices are higher compared to competitors too. Why come back when I have so many alternatives in the area?"}
{"text":"Service is a little ambivalent sometimes, but other than that, nothing to complain about. Pho is delicious, the broth is perfect and a variety of sizes depending on how hungry you are. And if pho isn't your thing, there's lots of other options. Once you get the order in, it comes out quick."}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time and really enjoyed the food/service. The owner of this place who is the lady who serves and does the cash is very nice & helpful. Food is fresh & very good. Not much MSG and not too salty unlike many other places that makes the fish sauce & food too salty with too much MSG. Highly recommend this place & would come again. Check out their Vermicelli with shrimp and pork/beef (Bun Thich Nuong). Very yummy & fresh :)"}
{"text":"The pho broth is what makes the pho. Their broth is alright. Service isn't bad. Prices are pretty good."}
{"text":"Better pho places around in the same area. Portions are small and soup gets watered down if it is too busy. The rice (com tam) is hard and dry. Been here a couple times before learning. Service is so-so. I don't expect much for service at pho though. Opt for another pho nearby if possible!"}
{"text":"My go to place. Love the shrimp paste on sugarcane. Nothing compares the theirs! 5/5 for that dish"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a good few times, it's conveniently close to work. I love my pho, and it's hard to mess it up. I give three stars because it's still a good place to go eat and I will be back for more for sure, but this place to me lacks consistency. Sometimes it's amazing and sometimes I wish it were better.

The service is usually good, I've caught the waitstaff in off moods though.

The condensed coffee with milk on ice comes in a tiny plastic take out cup already mixed. I like having it steep on the table and then I mix everything together. 

Like I said, I'll be eating here again. I suggest you try it too, but I wont post up that it's always the best when you might catch a bad day."}
{"text":"Had the pho ga \"chicken soup\" it was delicious best one other then the one spot downtown that I've tried. Spring rolls were good to here."}
{"text":"Ive been to many pho places so I know what a 4/5 should taste like.. this was not one of them. I had the large pho- no options for XL as the pho places around this neighbourhood offer it. The meat and noodles were sparse and were dunked in a pool of bland broth. Quantity was closer to a medium in most other places. My parents whom I have pho with regularly were also really disappointed with their meal. I felt bad since I recommended it using Yelp after seeing it a 4/5."}
