{"text":"Over priced. I'm used to prices in bigger cities so I was surprised that most buns costed more than $2, while they usually cost just a buck in other cities. However I was able to overlook this since Pittsburgh doesn't have a large Chinatown. Now the taste...if you've never had good asian bakery before, you should come check this out. But it's definitely not great by any means. The layout of the store and packaging of the buns are very cute. The taste is unfortunately lacking. I got the macha bun and pineapple bun, both were flavorless. Granted I did come to the store at 6pm so the food aren't out of the oven fresh, but it doesn't explain the lack in taste.   I would come back in the morning to see if the quality is any better"}
{"text":"I love that there is a Taiwanese bakery in Pittsburgh now. I always stock up on Chinese pastries when I visit family in NYC or Boston, which are pretty similar. When I ran across this place this morning I was so excited that I went right in even though I had stopped at another bakery just moments before. The workers were all getting ready for the day; one decorating a cake and another preparing something in the back. I was pleasantly greeted by a girl and chatted with her a bit.   They didn't have a lot of options yet because they had just opened  but they did have a few freshly baked buns on racks. I got a pineapple bun and a bun with hot dog and green onion. They were fresh out of the oven and still pretty hot. I couldn't wait to go home to try one so I sat down at the little table outside and ate the hot dog bun. The bread was light and fluffy and it was even better than the generic hotdog buns I am use to from Boston or NYC.   I ate the pineapple bun later for lunch and the bread was also light and fluffy with a hint of sweetness. The pineapple topping was not the typical Chinese crust. It was much lighter but still very pleasant.   I will definitely be back to try more things!"}
{"text":"I really need a fix of Asian bakery goods sometimes and pink box has really good flexible hours.  My complaint is that some one of their red bean buns are consistently not baked well enough. And inside is still gooey from the still raw dough. I come here every month and it happens fairly often.  I'll still come because I like Asian bakery goods, but if the timing is right, I'll try sumi instead.  Edit: This is my mistake. Sorry! Jennifer explained that it's the mochi red bun. It's not uncooked, just the gooey rice flour layer of mochis.  Great red bean buns, I personally prefer the pineapple red bean bun over the mochi one"}
{"text":"I'm shocked to see such good reviews on here because the food I tried was pretty disappointing. I picked up a lot of items but none of them were very good in my opinion. I was excited to try the beautiful taro pastries (see picture), it looked really appetizing but didn't have much taste. I also got a whole mocha roll and it had an almost fishy taste that I thought it actually went bad. such a waste since I could barely finish a bite of the mentioned food and others and just ended up throwing it out. :\ if you're in the area, I'd recommend Sumi's instead."}
{"text":"I got a piece of mango cake and a pineapple bun for my manfriend and I.  Needless to say I ate both..lol so good. The pineapple bun is perfection."}
{"text":"A fantastic little Asian bakery. I don't know if they've changed prices since some of the reviewers have gone, but pretty much everything I purchased was $2 or less.  Bread was soft and fresh, with the proper amount of filling.   Hopefully Pink Box is a permanent fixture for years to come!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few Asian bakeries in different Chinatowns, but this is one of my favorites!  This bakery, in my opinion, has similar but better tasting pastries than something like the Paris Baguette chains in HMarts.  Everything is always so fresh!  There are usually carts of freshly wheeled out pastries being unloaded if you get there early enough.  Their raisin bread was excellent for toast!  The Green Tea Red Bean filled bun is one I've never seen before and it is totally worth it!  All of the buns are also stuffed to the brim with filling.  I've not met a bun here that I have not liked.   The workers are always friendly and willing to answer any questions.  I've not had a cake yet but they always look too pretty to eat!  Though it's pay street parking, we've never had a problem finding a space on the street no matter what time of day we've gone there.  You want to get there early because they do run out of items!"}
{"text":"I needed a birthday cake  and came across Pink Box on Yelp so decided to check them out.  (I live nearby but  somehow missed noticing  a new bakery in my neighborhood.)  The owner and staff were welcoming and informative and the cake was as delicious as it was beautiful.  I'll be back to try more of their offerings!"}
{"text":"Pink box has a nice assortment of buns and other pastries for a Chinese bakery located in Pittsburgh. I got the strawberry bun, a slice of lychee cake and coconut bread. The lychee cake was just a tad too sweet for my taste but otherwise very moist and fresh. I made french toast with the coconut bread and WOW! I will be back to buy more it! The strawberry bun was nice, not too sweet but also buttery."}
{"text":"This is my to-go shop in Squirrel Hill to satisfy sweet cravings. My favorite items are the red bean bun and the coconut bread and bun. I did not like the chocolate filled bun they have, it was bland. Also, don't miss the small cookies they make (I don't know if they had \"names\")! They are sitting quietly at the back of the store next to the wall on the left. Perfect cookies to go with tea! In general, I like that their pastries are not too sweet, unlike your usual American sweets."}
{"text":"First time visit just hours ago and I'm already plotting a return.  They have fantastically delicious baked goods -- both savory and sweet -- with a distinctly Chinese tradition but French pastry execution.  Pork turnover was sinfully good; onion/pork roll was great served in three slices alongside a salad that evening; another patron mentioned how high quality and authentic their Hong Kong style pastries are and I found it hard not to buy and try them all.    Found several gluten free sweets here for my husband -- they have a cheesecake we did not get, but did buy all flavors of their French macaroon cookies (which were not his favorites, as they fell apart on first bite and were a bit too soft under the slight snap of shell -- still, came in a beautiful presentation box and he ate them all in one sitting liking the chocolate one best, while my fave was the coffee one); and we both LOVED their seemingly plain GF cookie, topped with a currant or craisin, couldn't tell.  They came in a plastic container of about a half dozen and were so very delectable.  I think I will miss this newly found place the most when I must leave this city for home!  (I hope I can talk them into doing mail order.)  Yum.  And some lovely packaging.  They mentioned they'd be adding some beverages to the menu.  That, and a few caf√© tables, and it could be the perfect little lunch, dessert, or afternoon pick-me-up spot."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this may have been one of the worst cupcakes I've ever had. Which is a shame."}
{"text":"a bit pricey than expected, and as i go there for a couple times i feel like the size is getting smaller while the price stays the same, so that is a bit discouraging especially when it is such a new store! the taste is good but i dont think some pieces are worth the price, especially when you can get a similar product for less money right across the street at sumi's."}
{"text":"Cute little bakery with a variety of different asian baked goods!   I tried their matcha bread with red bean and love it! I could tell the red bean paste inside was made fresh, because you could see the bean's skin in the paste.   Additionally, their pork sung (dried pork flakes) bun are pretty good as well!   The only qualm I would have with this place is their variety, which was pretty limited."}
{"text":"The baked goods here are as authentic as it can get! They also carry non Asian pastries which are as amazing. The owners are always friendly and knowledgeable about the pastries they serve! It's a really special treat to have an authentic bakery in squirrel hill!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Wonderful staff with pastries and buns that make your mouth water. Truly a gem amongst the typical hum-drum sweets options, even a basic white cake with strawberries are to die for!"}
{"text":"Yet to have had anything bad here. The quality of the breads vary a little sometimes but it's generally good. Don't hesitate when a fresh batch comes out of the oven.  We've ordered quite a few birthday cakes from here now and it's always been well done. Egg tarts are great, roll cakes and soft and creamy, and their bread loafs are something else."}
{"text":"Delightful. All the classics of Asian baked goods. We had a range of goodies: topping the list were the scallion bun, the ham, cheese and onion bun, and the thick cut perfectly square bread loaf. Which were all excellent. The egg custard was good, not great. Looking forward to an even larger selection of options as they grow."}
{"text":"Really good bakery. It's asian themed, so some of the items were a little unfamiliar. But I gave a few a try, like the custard tart and pork bun, which were both really good.  I will definitely be back.  Added bonus, most things are individually wrapped which makes it really easy to take to work/school."}
{"text":"I can't speak on the authenticity of these beautiful pastries but they not only look great, they also taste great. I love that they also have a selection of savory pastries which are my absolute favorite. I've tried the bbq pork buns, both the roasted ones and baked puff pastry ones. These are just amazing and I love getting a bunch of them and reheating them in the oven/toaster oven for breakfast. Both kinds are buttery, savory and slightly sweet. Their sweet pastries are just how dhiI haven't tried much in their refrigerated cases but I am always in awe of how beautiful they are. The only downfall is there is a $10 minimum for credit cards, which it can be hard to spend a whole ten dollars sometimes. Unless you're getting a bunch for later like I do, bring cash. Otherwise, these pastries make great snacks!"}
{"text":"It is a cute store with many varieties.  Bread are soft and fresh.  Service is friendly.  I feel that salt is overpowering in some buns.  I also bought three varieties of sliced bread and all of them are lack of flavor - the coconut one is particularly disappointing because I cannot taste coconut at all.    Overall, fresh bread and ingredient, but flavor can be improved."}
{"text":"Great Chinese bakery! Makes me feel like home. The bread and egg tarts taste amazing! Hope they will have more items in the future."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night sweets run the other day and was pleasantly surprised. When I first heard an Asian bakery was opening in squirrel hill I had my doubts but this place is the real deal.  The strawberry shortcake and chocolate cake were my favorites followed by the mocha cake. Definitely planning on using that shortcake as a birthday cake! All these cakes were fluffy, light, not too sweet, and flavorful    I was a bit disappointed by the matcha cake, it was quite dry and blocky.   Overall quite good, I want to try the Black Forest and taro cake at some point. Bought a ham and cheese bun to eat for breakfast the next day which was yummy as well."}
{"text":"This is a cute little bakery. The have sweet and savory treats. I like how they make their cakes with just the right amount of sweetness without being too sweet. Their curry fold overs are to die for :))) wish they had a little more of a selection though."}
{"text":"If you are looking for delicious fluffy buns, this is the place. I tried about six different buns and they were sweet but not overly sweet. They have a very nice selection of many different flavors. My favorites were the red bean paste, the one with almonds and the hotdog one. They even have breakfast buns with ham and cheese. They also have pastries that I plan on trying next time I go. This would be a great place to stop by on your way to school or work. Their customer service is great. The people at the front greet you warmly and are very helpful."}
{"text":"If I had reviewed Pink Box after the first five timesI had gone there, I would have given them five stars, but I've had a few incidences that dropped my opinion a bit. If I could give them 3.5 stars I would.   All of their macarons are delicious. I have unfortunately been given the wrong flavor macaron more than once. Both times I was given lemon instead of vanilla and both times it was an unpleasant surprise. The lemon macarons are good, but not a good replacement for vanilla.  The roll cakes I've tried have not been great and I did not really like my coconut pastry, BUT there are a bunch of other desserts I have tried and enjoyed: -The bread (both bean and chocolate) -All of the taro products -Shortbread cookies -Almond flak pastry -Fruit tart  -Almond brittle  The people who own/work there are also usually really helpful and sweet."}
{"text":"Ok b/c I don't have any other options in Pittsburgh. Compared to what you get in major cities like NYC, Philly, SF, etc....it is very overpriced for mediocre taste."}
{"text":"Quaint little bakery.   Homemade breads and pastries.  Tarts and cakes.   We purchased by the slice.   We tried a hazelnut chocolate mousse slice and a strawberry cake slice.   The strawberry slice was delicate,  fresh and so delicious.   The hazelnut chocolate mousse slice was rich and decadent.   Yummy!"}
{"text":"Taste: 3/5 Definitely not on par with the asian bakery of NYC/LA/SD. This taste includes bread/cake/tiramisu.  Price: 2/5 I cant understand paying 3 dollars for bread that is stale and the filling is bland.   I do frequent this place more times that I want, being the only asian bakery in town.  The employee there is not chinese. She has no Idea what I am asking when I saw taro, or red bean....or black sesame (didnt know what that was)"}
{"text":"They have this green tea bun with red bean paste in it and it's sooooo delicious!"}
{"text":"I ventured here, after having dinner nearby.  I was surprised that it was still open at 8:00 p.m., most bakeries close early.  Pink Box is a quaint little bakery with lots of asian delicacies to choose from.  I was pretty full from dinner, so chose a package of almond shortbread cookies.  There were at least a dozen in the package and the cookies were baked to absolute perfection.  I would definitely return to try some of the other offerings."}
{"text":"It's a place for sweets and soft breads. I didn't have good experience there. They do have a lot options which I don't think tasty. Besides the atmosphere and service wasn't very good. Price is okay but I prefer other bakeries."}
{"text":"Not sure what to think of this place. One the one hand, this is one of the only breadhouses that I know of in Pittsburgh, but man is it overpriced. Coming from Philly and having been to other cities like NYC, Boston, and DC, prices at this joint are at least three to four times more expensive than the pastries that I can get in the cities I just mentioned. Do like the varieties though and the fact that they really do try to experiment with different recipes of pastries, but man is the price for one a little bit hard to swallow."}
{"text":"Hmm, not in Chinatown!   Disappointed... was advertised as Chinese bake products.  Looked like it, but wasn't the authentic deal.  Egg custard tarts were too doughy, BBQ buns were heavy, and the establishment didn't even use the \"traditional\" pink box for take out orders.  Will have to wait for another trip to SF Chinatown or at least the one in NYC,  Good try owners.....but no cigars, so to speak!  Or \"bu hao\""}
{"text":"Recently, I've been shirking my duties as the resident Bakery Queen of PGH.  I decided to pick up the slack on Sun. by stopping into Pink Box at around 12:45pm to grab a few pastries.  I'd dropped by before, but hadn't picked anything up, and regretted it.  This time, I didn't make that mistake, and was able to satiate my sweet tooth!  Based on the reviews of others and the staff's recommendations, I got a pineapple bun ($1.75), a green tea red bean bun ($2.25), and a chocolate fruit tart ($4.99).  All of them were good, but I agree with other reviewers that they seem a bit overpriced.  In terms of flavor, I'd describe them as \"just sweet enough,\" so if you don't like overly sweet baked goods, you'll probably enjoy them.  I was a bit disappointed that I didn't see any goods made with pandan, but this encouraged me to try some novel sweets.  Despite having visited Hong Kong, I'd never had a pineapple bun, so I didn't realize that they didn't include pineapple filling, but are named based on their shape, which resembles a pineapple (see photo).  The green tea red bean bun, on the other hand, was filled with red bean paste, which was delightful, reminding me of desserts I've sampled in Singapore.  As for the chocolate fruit tart, I felt that its name was a bit deceitful, given that the filling was regular vanilla egg custard--the only chocolate on it was drizzled on top, and it wasn't even that chocolatey.  Having said that, the tart was aesthetically pleasing and delicious due to the generous assortment of fruit that it contained--though the crust was rather pedestrian.  Overall, I was pleased with the baked goods and service I received from Pink Box, but I wish they'd lower their prices a bit.  Given that they're currently the only East Asian bakery in PGH, though, I doubt that will happen unless they receive some competition.  Nevertheless, I'd recommend giving it a try to sample some novel and delicious baked goods from that part of the world, esp. if you've never tried them before!"}
{"text":"On my way to work one day I had decided to detour myself around the Parkway East traffic.  I had also decided to do something nice for my coworkers.  That's how I ended up here at Pink Box Bakery Cafe.  I had done a quick search for a bakery to bring in a treat for everyone.  This place isn't hard to find in Squirrel Hill.  I mean it is a bright pink storefront.  If you can miss that, I guess you don't deserve to come here.  It is always nice walking into a bakery.  All those sweet smells that instantly make your stomach grumble in anticipation.  There are plenty of pre-made treats to be had in here, but I went straight to the cake display case and knew that all those cupcakes were coming with me.  ALL THE CUPCAKES!  (If you happened to be there that day, I apologize...somewhat, for taking all the cupcakes (but deep down inside, no, I'm not sorry))  It seemed a bit pricey at the time for the cupcakes, but once my coworkers and I took our first bites, they were worth every penny.  Half were white with white icing and candy shavings on them.  The other half were chocolate with chocolate icing and chocolate shavings on them.  Both topped with a half of a sandwich cookie.  Everyone raved over how good they were and that they weren't too sweet.  And this is what floored me, no one had any idea that Pink Box existed.  I had to keep telling them where it was.  I am sure now that they know where it is as they all seem to be under some kind of trance from the sugary goodness."}
{"text":"Very very cute and clean. Easy to navigate and everything is labeled properly. Prices are fair, the baked goods are all very fresh (you can see them cooling on a bake rack when walking in!). I would love if they had more savory options, however the curry puffs and \"standard bakery\" (cheese & hot dog buns, scallion rolls, etc.) items are enough for me! Their bread loafs - taro, coconut, raisin, and plain - are amazing (and make awesome french toast, if anyone was wondering)! Also, the staff is always really nice and willing to answer any questions.  Although I haven't tried them yet, the \"prettier\" looking cakes, tarts, and macarons in the display next to the register are beautiful. Hope to give them a go for a special occasion or something!"}
{"text":"Their $6 log cakes are my absolute favorite they come so many different flavors.. the cakes are super airy and light not super sweet that is actually why I love this place! I am not into heavy and sugary sweet cakes I like light, airy and not too sweet cakes and pink box delivers that every time for me. Oh and also, make sure to try their breads yum!"}
{"text":"How can you not love a Pink Box? I've loved a lot of Pink Boxes in my day, but none quite like this one.  This Pink Box, in reality, is a Taiwanese Bakery owned by same people that own Rose Tea. It clearly has an awesome name and awesome decor too. It feels like a little square pink box inside. Like you are inside an Xmas present from VS Pink, perhaps.   Some of the servers are super friendly, although one in particular wasn't. One of the really friendly ones was a beautiful girl from Albania, talking to her was fun.   I find their baked goods to be somewhat average, made in advance and pre-packaged, and their Bubble Tea reminds me of the one over at the similarly-owned Rose Tea Cafe. I got the black milk tea, and it wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near as good as the one across the street at Sumi's Cakery. The tapioca balls were kind of squidgy, which I didn't really appreciate. And it was a little tasteless.  I guess a Pink Box is preferable to a Brown Box though."}
{"text":"TLDR; Buns are subpar and too expensive for the quality. Specific criticisms below.  I recently came here and bought 7 different buns/baked goods to try this place out. I got a pineapple bun, pork sung bun, pork sung bun + green onion roll, flaky pork sung bun, hot dog + green onion bun, egg tart, and lotus + egg yolk moon cake. Overall, it wasn't actively *bad*, but I was not impressed for a few reasons:  (1) The buns were more expensive than I'm used to in other cities ($2-$2.25 instead of maybe $1.50 or so). This would be fine if they were amazing buns, but they really weren't.  (2) The pineapple bun had a roughly ping pong ball sized lump of pure butter and sugar in the middle (see photos). At first I wondered if it was some kind of creamy filling they intentionally put there so I tried biting into it, but it was absolutely disgusting so I think it was definitely because they failed to mix the dough well. Plus, the bun was awfully dry.  (3) Hot dog + green onion buns are my favorite kind of Asian bun, but the one I got here was so boring and plain. When I get them from other bakeries, the green onions are typically embedded in some kind of salty, flavorful, eggy mixture (it's hard to explain). However, at this place they just sprinkle the green onions directly on the dough without the eggy part, so you don't get that extra flavor boost or the contrasting textures.  (4) The pork sung buns had too much mayonnaise, to the point that you could visibly see globs of white and I just felt physically gross after eating them. To be fair, they are very generous with pork sung, so they probably need more mayonnaise to glue it on. Still, I think they could stand to use a little less.  Also (this isn't a critique, just a general comment): note that this place tends to sell the Taiwanese variations of things. So for instance, the egg tarts are not as gelatinous and eggy as the typical Hong Kong style egg tart you're probably accustomed to. Similarly, the moon cakes are these flaky balls instead of those ornate hockey puck shaped ones."}
{"text":"First if all, the father and dougther who work there are super nice and friendly. They answer your questions patiently and provide good comments.  We bought couple of items, chocolate roll, taro bun with almond, taro mochi bun and they were all Great! And they are not expensive unlike many bakeries!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh has a fruit tart shortage.  I do not understand why because fruit tarts are what heaven is made of.  So after a desperate search one night, I discovered Pink Box has Asian and European baked goods!  Score!  The blueberry fruit tart ($3) was PACKED with blueberries.  More than I have ever received on a fruit tart, and they were perfectly ripe.  The custard in the tart was the perfect amount of sweetness, and they used graham cracker crust for the tart, my favorite!  This fruit tart was awesome.  But I spent less on pastries when I lived in NYC than here, which makes me cringe.  The staff was super super super friendly and made recommendations and explained things, which was awesome.  I really need to get back here and test out the Asian and other desserts!"}
{"text":"Bought three pastries here. One of them was good, service was a little sketchy, I'm pretty sure the lady at the register pulled a Houdini and double charged us 7 dollars. Authentic taste, but I want my money back #wheredembands"}
{"text":"Their red bean buns are the only thing I've had here, and they are the only thing I need to have. Most red bean buns you buy are just a bun stuffed with red bean paste so you get a mouthful of red bean in the middle and nothing but bun on the sides. Pink box makes it so that it's even all the way through, like they layered the top of the bun on top of the paste instead of just injecting paste into it. They also have some sesame seed kind of things on top and I love sesame seeds. I literally cannot have any other red bean buns after coming here."}
{"text":"Stopped here to pick up some dessert for my mom's birthday.  I didn't want to tempt her with a whole cake so I got two slices of strawberry cake and two fruit custard pies.  Mann they were good.  Not too sweet but very flavorful plus they came in a cute box!  The place reminded me of grocery stores and small bakery cafes in Japan.  I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm so delicious. I was so excited to hear about a new chinese bakery in town and they did not disappoint! I tried two different buns and the lotus moon cakes, all very good but the lotus moon cakes were INCREDIBLE. There are also a variety of non-chinese bakery items that looked delectable as well. Pricing is ok - not the cheapest but worth the quality of their food. Will most definitely be returning to try out more items!"}
{"text":"Napoleon was very dry. Instead of puff pastry they used some sort of cookie reminiscent of a biscotti and instead of cream, icing. The few other items we bought seemed over priced. Overall a disappointing visit."}
{"text":"Ahh! I love Pink Box.  We were very excited knowing that an Asian bakery is opening in this area. I have tried a few bakeries in Chinatown in Boston, and I have always liked the stuff I got there, so I was kind of happy when this one opened.  We usually get the buns, puffs, almond biscuits and some pastries to go. I really like the puffs, (the vegetarian one is the one I have tried) since it is so similar to what we get back in India :) The green onion bun and the pineapple buns are delicious too! Seems like everything is freshly made in the bakery at the back. The people working there are really cordial too!  I agree, it's a bit pricey but I definitely don't mind paying that for the items available!"}
{"text":"A very unique bakery! I actually came in for coffee and a pastry, as coffee was advertised outside on the window. I asked for coffee and they said they don't make any but will start to sometime soon. I ended up ordering a jasmine green tea and assumed it would be hot, but was actually basically a cold bubble tea. It was one of the best I have ever had, even though I didn't know I wanted it! I have tried several pastries here. I had their moon cakes but I didn't know they had lard in them. I also tried two mochi pastries, one red bean and one taro. I liked the red bean much better than the taro. Very bizarre indeed! I've really never eaten pastries like this before.   The second time I came in, I ordered matcha cookies which are like biscuits. I liked them. Not very sweet but would be great with a hot, sweet drink. I think they need to label the pastries that have lard/meat in them and I think they need to bring their prices down a little. Some things are a little overpriced. I recommend their tea! And their very sweet pastries. Anything else is up to your personal taste."}
{"text":"A bakery similar to those you would find in a Chinatown in a large city with slightly higher prices due to lack of competition. This place will do great if you are craving some pastries, but I've found some of their pastries to be a little dry, too sweet and a little sparse on the filling.   They are still \"working\" on getting their coffee going for a few months now. I would love to get some coffee or bubble tea with a pastry! Hopefully they start serving beverages!"}
{"text":"Ordered a birthday cake here and it was delicious!!! We got the 8\" taro cake ($35). The taste was well balanced and the cream and icing wasn't overly sweet (which is how we preferred it). The cake itself was soft and spongy. Perfect  At first we were skeptical that we would even be able to find a taro cake in Pittsburgh but this is the place to go!!  Loved loved loved the cake!   They also sell individual slices for those who are curious about taro cake!  I've tried their baked goods and those are good too!"}
{"text":"Yum! Great Chinese baked goods. I had a sampling of a lot of different pastries. The taro mochi buns are amazing! I could eat these all day! The rest of the selections are all right - if you have a craving for asian buns that can't be quenched, this will fix you up but you will pay a pretty premium for it. Prices and products reflect the lack of competition."}
{"text":"Give me a minute to collect my thoughts because Pink Box Bakery just blew my mind.  The store front with it's bright pink covering is enough to invoke one's curiosity.  Stepping into the bakery you are graciously greeted by the employees, who, if you ask, will delightedly tell you about any of their sweet and savory offerings.    Pink Box Bakery has a variety of flavored buns. This time I got a ham and cheese bun and a pineapple cream bun.  They were both delicious! And I can't get over the prices!  You'll pay between $1.75 and $2.50 for just about any bun!"}
{"text":"Their buns are awesome. Way better than the place down the street.   Their bubble tea is spot on and they make it hot too if you want during the winter!  Try the mochi buns!"}
{"text":"Uhmm it wasn't what I expected-I, along with lady friends, were looking for some sweet treats late night and found this place on YELP-was hoping for a more traditional bakery, yet the strawberry cake was light and tasty although would have rather had a more heavier, sweeter, denser strawberry cake-nothing against the bakery though"}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick up a birthday cake since GE's cakes looked crappy. It's a smaller store with lots of bread, pastries and sweets. The bigger items are behind the glass. I chose a chocolate cake ($35) and they offered to write \"Happy birthday\" on it for me. It took about ten minutes for them to write on it, wrap it and check out, but I didn't mind because everything looked so well done. They definitely put their all in their products.   The cake was a hit and was enough for ten slices plus a few left over. It was so light yet satisfying. Nothing about it was too sweet or heavy (which was great after a big meal). The icing was more of a whipped cream-type rather than buttercream."}
{"text":"This place is not AMAZING compared to the bakeries in New York or other big cities with large asian populations, but considering that it's in Pittsburgh, I would say that it's pretty awesome! The pastries and bread are always fresh, and the people who work there are pretty nice. I like the prices as well!"}
{"text":"Every item I've had from here has been very tasty. I really like the ham and cheese pastries. BUT what kind of bakery doesn't open until 10am? I find this incredibly odd. I'd definitely stop here to pick up something for breakfast if they opened before I had to be at work!  Also I giggle like Beavis and Butthead every time I think of the name."}
{"text":"I honestly wasn't very impressed. When I first walked in, it smelled amazing and my eyes darted every which way to all the tasty-looking breads and cakes and tarts. I walked around and surveyed which bread to try. The variety was a thumbs up here. I really didn't know where to begin or what to pick. Maybe I should have asked.  I ended up getting a fruit tart and bread with almond icing in between. I forget what it was exactly. The tart was pretty bland though the size of it was fair. I tried the bread and it was really sweet, but the overall taste was appealing. I would give this place another try and ask for suggestions next time."}
{"text":"4 stars to 5 stars, it's really not a big difference but I felt that Pink Box deserved this.  The reason for the change? Everything improved. All my reservations about this place were gone the 6th time around (I wish they had frequency cards).  This is the only place I will ever go to for my pastries (of the Asian persuasion) and I firmly believe that my opinion will never change.   Their variety of pastries has expanded and it's always a delight to see what variations they have for the day.  I don't know any other pastry store that has so much selection and so much circulation of pastries.   TLDR; 10 out of 10 need to go again."}
{"text":"We finally stopped by Pink Box one night after months and months of meaning to. I really like how this place stays open till 10pm, since other nearby bakeries usually close by 7 or 8pm. After looking at our available options, my husband and I took home 3 buns:   (1) pineapple green tea with red bean filling:  I love pineapple buns, especially ones  with red bean filling. This is the one bun I always get at every Taiwanese bakery. But who would have thought to incorporate green tea into it?? The green tea was a really nice touch and gave the good ol pineapple bun a nice kick to it.   (2) pineapple bun with milk cream filling;  (3) milk cream puff pastry bun;  (2) and (3) were similar except for the exterior but I personally didn't like the milk cream filling, it was a little too salty for me.   I do agree with Laura M. that this place is overpriced. I'm used to paying $1.25 -1.50 per bun, but here they charge anywhere from $1.75-2.25, and more for cakes and tarts. I see that the buns were individually wrapped which is nice and sanitary."}
{"text":"SETTING:  It's funny how all the Taiwanese bakeries are set up the same: shelves of bread along the walls, a fridge in the corner, an island in the middle with more pastries, and then the see-through glass case with cakes/desserts right next to the register. Is this an official Taiwanese bakery blueprint? No matter, it's comforting to see how things can be kept the same even in a totally different environment.     FOOD: For a place this size, they have a decent amount of choices. I saw the usual kids at the playground--Patrick Pineapple Buns, Gary Green Onion Bread with Hotdog, Emily Egg Tarts, Roger Rolls with the swirly cream things in it (that my ah-ma always eats for breakfast). Nostalgia hit me hard and fast like the unforgiving winter wind outside.   Then I saw something different, something a bit more fancy pants. Geraldine Green tea bun with Red bean. Drool. I love green tea and I love red bean...but together in a pastry? Let me get at that! I also got the green onion bread with the pork for old times sake...a classic favorite.   SERVICE: Close to none, but that's how most of these bakeries are: self-serve. You pick up your own pastries and put them in a basket and they ring you up at the front. I could hear both the workers chatting loudly about their social life, which is fine. It would be nice to acknowledge customers and ask if there was anything we were looking for. Not a huge deal. I hate to say it, but this interaction is pretty normal in pastry shops like these. When I did ask them something, it felt like I was interrupting them. Again, normal, but I don't care much for it.   IMPRESSIONS: My trip to Pinkbox was not complete until I took my first bite. My childhood flashed right before my eyes. The tears of nostalgia were short-lived as they rolled down my cheeks and immediately turned into icicles from the subzero weather. Worth it? I'm leaning towards yes. Prices are about a dollar more than I'm accustomed to back in CA, but as far as I know, this is the only Taiwanese bakery in Pittsburgh, so I will be coming back to try their other breads. I'll have to wait until it's a bit warmer outside, so I can blame my tears of happiness on spring allergies."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Taiwanese food and it was epic.  This has got to be one of the best bakeries that I have had in Pittsburgh.  The rolls were made fresh and were simply delicious.  If you are in squirrel Hill, I would definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Pink box is brand new in what is quickly becoming a very crowded bakery rich stretch on Murray ave.  Pink box is a Chinese bakery with lots of buns.  We a each got one. One was like frosting covered and the other was cream filled.  All that and they have a cookies and more traditional desserts.  I haven't had anything bad from here yet."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about the service here!  I actually stopped in for regular bakery bread, because I saw \"bread\" advertised on their window.  When I realized that it was a Chinese bakery, I got a tad bit giddy.  A guy came right over to me and pointed out what was what, and which items were popular, etc.  I chose a pork bun, and a red bean bun (which I haven't had since I was in Taiwan).  Both were really tasty!    Yes, some of the items are on the \"pricey\" end.  But, what do you expect from a place that A. has zero competition as far as I know, and B. is paying Squirrel Hill rent?  I've had similar quality (but slightly bigger and less expensive) buns at the Vietnamese bakery in Philly's Chinatown.  However, the fact that it is now possible to get this treat in the 'Burgh is worth paying a little extra.  I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Awesome n fresh stuff.. N I like d timings too.. Unlike a lota pastry shops I found in Pittsburgh they don't close at 3 pm!"}
{"text":"Every bread I've tried at this place is so fluffy & delicious every time. Simple flavors like onion bread, red bean, & chocolate filled. They have a lot of Taro pastries & my favorite are the taro swirl cookies. They're soft & flaky with a dense taro center. I haven't tried any of their cake slices yet but they are very pretty to look at."}
{"text":"Nice little bakery. Has lots of sweet and savory breads. Love the red bean bread and bread with chives.  Bubble teas are great. They also sell cakes and such which look amazing."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh finally has it's own Chinese pastry bakery. I've been craving custard buns, roasted pork buns, and pineapple buns since I've come here to live and Pink Box is the answer. The bakery's format is exactly like Chinese bakeries. To select what you want, you grab a tray and tongs and go to each station to see whether that particular baked good piques your interest. I would say they have a nice selection of baked goods and stay true to the Chinese-style. I ended up getting the roasted pork puff pastry and pineapple bun. My main complaint would be the cost of each baked good. The pineapple bun was $1.75 which is more expensive than most of the places I've been to in NYC.   As a far warning, there is a $10 minimum to use a credit card.  The roasted pork puff pastry was alright. The puff pastry was too dense but the roasted pork was on point. I have yet to try the pineapple bun and am looking forward to it. They have more options I would like to try before I permanently rate this place so stay tuned!"}
{"text":"While this place certainly can't compare to some of the Asian bakeries that exist in California's Bay Area (I attend university here but come from there), it does offer some decent pastries. There are pineapple buns (which don't have any pineapple, haha!), red bean mochi buns, taro pastries, and curry, vegetable, or BBQ pork puffs. There's also a cupcake bun with cream cheese frosting packed inside and powdered sugar dusted on the surface that's SO huge, filling, and super sweet (I have a major sweet tooth and survive on sweets for lunch most days), but that seems to be an item that rotates days, as I didn't see it consistently displayed. There are also almond brittle-type cookies and this absolutely enormous almond-covered pastry that looks like a burnt almond torte, and yet it's of a similar price to most of the other pastries. Most of the breads/pastries are in the $1.50-$2.75 range. The center table always has moon cakes, and that's about all I remember of it.  The red velvet cake in the display case wasn't particularly amazing - a bit dry and the cream cheese frosting was of generic texture and sweetness, but the amount offered was fairly large. I'd certainly like to try the fruit tarts and other cakes before making a definitive judgment though! I think it was either $2.50 or $3.  The shop is too small to fit a seating area though, which is a bit disappointing because I have to remember to plan to go there before I get too hungry to walk (as I have to walk back to campus to eat!)."}
{"text":"I love a chance to try anything new and Pink box provides carefully crafted Vietnamese sticky buns and Other pastries. As well as beautiful cakes and cookies.  I tried a sticky pork roll which hit my mouth with a pow of super sweet and salty with a chewy texture. This was not for me but if you like extremes you may enjoy it!   I also tried a green and red bean curd bun, with a lighter flavoring and softer texture these were definitely for me :)  To top it off because It looked irresistible I had the taro cake it was light, flavored perfectly with the right texture. Blackberries added. A nice accent to the taro flavor.   I only gave three stars because the staff had a request about not using my debit card. I do prefer and mostly only carry my debit since it is 2015. But that's just me!"}
{"text":"Good, but more expensive than Sumi's Cakery and Bubble Pi down the street. Might return for a more special occasion, but it's too expensive to visit regularly.   We tried: Moon cakes with egg yolk (flaky non-traditional kind) - really good Cheese w/ hot dog and green onion w/ hot dog buns - good Pineapple bun - ok"}
{"text":"Cute little shop. There's a bunch of rows of different pastries, and a really nice, wide variety.   I got the coconut bun which was $2. The bread was fresh and the topping was good, but there wasn't that much of it.   I got their mango bubble tea, regular sized, for 2.75. They also offer a large. Boba and other toppings are an extra 50 cents each. The regular size is actually pretty small, and the ice is small too so when you drink from the straw, you get boba and ice. Also, they are kinda sparse on the amount of boba they give.   They don't take credit card unless your total cost is up to $10. I found the staff slightly unfriendly, and thought the breads were a little pricey, especially because a lot of Asian bakeries are usually a lot cheaper, however, if you're in the area, definitely come try the place out."}
{"text":"Yum. That is all I can say about the Pink Box Bakery Cafe. Yum. I mean I can and will say a lot more but yum is probably the best word to convey how great this place is. Picture this, a nice Saturday morning and brunch plans were made. We wanted some toast or bread to go with our food and on my way to my friends house I decided to stop here to see what treats they had. I, and my brunch friends, were not disappointed. I will say that I did order more than I normally would because they did have a $10 minimum to use a card. I usually hate these restrictions but...when the option was more pastries I really was not complaining.   Bread: Coconut bread. Let me tell you this stuff was great. I loved that it had little flecks of coconut cream or something baked into the bread. Sometimes shops just mix it in the batter or just have it on the top, not this, the cream was just nice and subtle but added that much more to the bread experience. It was nice and thick and toasted perfectly. Yum.   Buns: Ok, I admit. I had to try a few of these. I know we were going to have brunch but.... they just looked so good and fresh that I had to get a few!  Pork Sung Green Onion Bun: Um... how was this so good. I ate this the next morning heated up in the microwave and it was PERFECT. The pork was so thin and shredded perfectly and the green onions added just enough to the bun to make it perfect. I could not believe it heated up as well as it did. I would get this again for sure.   Chocolate Custard Bun: Yes, this was a perfect little treat to eat while we were still cooking brunch. I could not believe the amount of custard that was actually in this bun. I was very surprised, pleasantly of course. The custard was not overly sweet an went perfectly with the slightly sweetened dough. Yummmy!  I got two more but I left those for my friends to eat for lunch. I am really looking forward to coming back here. I loved the buns and want to bring them to more events and that bread, I will be dreaming about it until we meet again. I think that everyone should try out the Pink Box Bakery because it was a real treat. There were so many things in the shop that I wanted but had to stop myself from getting. The next time, I hope I have the same restraint!"}
{"text":"Wow! I did not think that I would see the day where there would be a Chinese bakery in Pittsburgh tho most likely because of lack of competition and volume compared to other big cities they charge the prices they do. A friend suggested we try Pink Box Bakery Cafe. I hesitated this round to try my favorites but settled on a pork and chive bun at the suggestion of the staff, who are friendly. It was tasty!! My friend was happy with her ham and cheese bun. I'll be back for more - maybe try my beloved egg tarts and sweet bun - though there is a $10 minimum with the credit card and they don't offer tap water (no cups). They will have moon cakes though! Will keep that in mind for the festivals next year. There was seating outside but otherwise no where to sit inside."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I've tried several items here. Some varieties I do like are the green tea/red bean stuffing combo, the bun with taro/mochi inside, and the roll with scallion and pork rinds. The pineapple bun was okay to me - I like mine with a generous amount of flaky topping; this one was pretty sparse on top.  I took a bunch home the last time I went, and ate it for a couple days. Had it in the fridge first and then put it in the oven, like 250 degrees for 10 minutes. I guess I discovered this by accident, but I found it's surprisingly good hot : )  Overpriced for sure....it was average probably $2 for a bun. I'm used to them being $1-$1.50 per bun."}
{"text":"The pork roll with green onion is to die for! It's a cute place and I will stop again! The roll was light and airy yet savory and flavorful. The bread itself definitely had an egg wash ( my guess) since it was a nice light brown golden color. The green onion is slight and complimentary to the savory shredded pork."}
{"text":"This is an awesome bakery that has interesting pastries. I loved all the Taro pastries. Their bubble tea was incredible as well!!!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my first trip here and decided to give it another shot so I stopped in for a couple treats.  The cakes were wonderfully presented and looked delicious.  They're on the smaller side so I picked up 3 for my companion and I.  The white chocolate mousse cake was EXTREMELY sweet, to the point neither of us could take more than 2 bites, and I LOVE sweets.  I don't think I've ever said something was too sweet.  We had to throw the rest of it away.  We got the cheesecake as well which was ok, nothing special.  Our final dessert was the tiramisu which had a bottom that tasted chalky.  We ended up throwing it away too.    The presentation is wonderful but deceptive, imo"}
{"text":"Pink box is a Taiwanese style bakery. I was so excited when they first opened my first year in Pittsburgh. I miss it so much. Everything they baked is fresh and very authentic. They also have many different flavor cakes such as taro, coffee, mango, vanilla...etc. I noticed there is a book for custom made cake, I would update my review if I ever tried them. I always come here to get their toast, taro toast, wide variety of bread bun, or the pastry bean pasted filled balls. They're phenomenal.  The only thing I would suggest improving is the price, it could definitely be lower. The bread shop in philly is half of the price here. However, there isn't much competition in Pittsburgh for Asian bakery. Besides that, keep up the good work pink box!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for asian sweets and this place finally helped me fill that craving!  Surprised they were still open at 9 and still had a great selection, I got a taro pastry (which is fantastic!) an egg tart, and a curry puff. Hopefully the curry puff will take me back to nyc's chinatown bakeries!"}
{"text":"I love that we have this bakery in Squirrel Hill!   I have been a few times and each thing I have tried is great!   Their egg custard tarts are very good and I love their pork buns!   They also have some great sweets and their cheese filled bun tastes like the best cheesecake filling ever!"}
{"text":"This place is unmissable. It's very much a giant pink box. I got a taro cake from here for my friend's birthday. The saleswoman was very nice, and she came around from behind the counter to help me pick out a cake. Our interaction went like this:  Me: I need a cake for 6 people, what size would you recommend? Her: Do you like cake? Because you can split the 6\", but if you like cake you should maybe get the 8\"  I did in fact get the 8\", because it was the only size they had available for the taro flavor. I suspect they don't ready-make taro in the 6\" size? Sneaky  Apparently we don't like cake because the 8\" was way to much for my group of 6. Nevertheless we very much enjoyed this cake, and the leftovers the next day were equally delicious. I like very rich and sweet frosting, so I was skeptical when I saw other reviews describing the frosting as \"not too sweet\". However, the taro mixed into to the frosting made it very flavorful  Their cakes are a little on the pricey side, 8\" rang up to $39"}
{"text":"The pineapple bread was mediocre (not much flavor and a little bit dry). However, the store's interior is very cute.  [**employee is not at the store anymore** The employee at the cash register did not have a good demeanor when we were checking out.]"}
