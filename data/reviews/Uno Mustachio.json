{"text":"I consider myself to be a pretty good eater, but I split one of these beautiful sandwiches and didn't have any room to sample the other treats at the market!  No regrets though- this thing was tasty.  I had the veal and fried eggplant, loaded with tomato sauce, peppers and onions.  If you're not into high carb, high fat, and high oil, well, skip this for the organic salad stand by the entrance.  But, if you do have one, try to get it when the veal and eggplant are freshly made- they'll be crispy and warm and flavorful.  They are battered and fried after all, so you don't want one that's been sitting out."}
{"text":"3.5 would be a fair judgment. I can only however speak for the chicken sandwich, as that was what both members of my party were enjoying as well. I have to say, it was good, it left me more than satisfied, adequately stuffed, and craving that one last bite, where all the toppings seem to congregate into a joyous plethora of taste climax. However, I was very disheartened by the quality of the service, as my Faux Italian server mumbled, god knows what, ignoring most of the requests i had. The price seemed fair enough for a lunch haunt near to work, so that was O.K in my books. I just wasn't as happy with all the hype surrounding the place, leaving st.lawrence wishing i had went to get the delectable fish and chips instead."}
{"text":"I love this place, they are very nice and quick. The veal is fantastic choice for the California sandwiches. They use to have the focaccia bread .. Not sure if they have them back in stock. But I'm always satisfied and full when I grab a sandwich from here."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  The veal was dry, bread was dry.  Even with the extra sauce, it was still too dry.  Needed to chug down a bottle of water."}
{"text":"After hearing about how amazing their veal sandwiches are, I was really looking forward to trying one of  them today. At 11:20 a.m., there was no line either. Great. right? Ugh. I took a couple of bites and gave up on it.  (a) The kaiser roll it comes on is too big, too hard, and too flavorless. It tastes like crusty Styrofoam and scraped several layers of skin off the roof of my mouth. (b) The veal cutlet was pre-fried in old oil and sitting cold under \"heat\" lamps for god knows how long even at 11:20 a.m. The meat was also stringy and severely under-seasoned. Ew. (c) The accompanying tomato sauce was scant and also under-seasoned.  To add insult to injury, when I paid for my order, I got a twoonie as change which I put in my pocket. The grunty woman who made my sandwich promptly came over to the till and checked in the Tip cup to see if I had left a little extra something for her. WTF? Who does that?'  Here's a tip, unpleasant sandwich assembly automaton lady: Use better bread, season the veal with some salt, and don't be so stingy with the tomato sauce!  I gave the rest of my sandwich to a homeless man on King Street but now I'm wondering if he will come after me for giving him such awful food.  Mustachio? I'd rename it \"Mustachi-NO!\""}
{"text":"I believe this place is actually called Uno Mustachio and in terms of Italian sandwiches in this city, it is certainly in the top five! The sandwiches will run you about $8 or $9 but they are enormous--I can usually only eat half in a sitting. You can do breaded eggplant, chicken, veal, or a combination thereof. My favourite is the veal and eggplant, which features multiple layers of both, and you can add sauce, peppers, onions, etc. They do the regular chicken parm, meatball sandwich, etc, but the real winners here are the eggplant / chicken / veal sandwiches.  It's just consistently delicious. The staff are friendly and efficient. Since they are in the market they do close pretty early (best to get there before 4pm, I think), but it's worth it to grab a sang and a Brio or Orangina for lunch, eat half, and save the rest for dinner."}
{"text":"Quasi-Italian, deep-fried-in-the-same-oil, oily sandwiches... I guess that people flock there because of the sheer size of the sandwich? (which by the way shrank considerably as the years passed).  Maybe 4 years ago this was an OK place to eat, however right now the buns are usually not fresh, the meat is thin (with thick deep-fried oily coating), focaccia bread was dry and chewy the other day... and the guys serving you are very rude (especially if you have some special request other than the plain sandwich with everything on it). There is no variety, you can have chicken sandwich, or veal sandwich (with or without eggplant), and a chicken/veal parmigiano with very salty and low quality parmesan cheese and that's pretty much it. Gets awfully boring after some time.  The only good thing is their tomato sauce, but even that...is no brainer to make really."}
{"text":"It's Mr Mustachios to me and my mates? Not sure about grand opening comments it's been in the basement of the st Lawrence market for years! Great big veal and eggplant sangawidge ! Delicious and quite filling will cure a hangover or set you up for a big afternoon. The bomb dude!!"}
{"text":"I'd rather chew some tinfoil than eat one of these 'famous' sandwiches. Save yourself the wait and go upstairs - Paddington's makes a better veal on a bun as does Carousel."}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of the veal and eggplant sandwiches when I worked in the area and would take my lunch breaks at St. Lawrence Market.  The place was definitely five stars without a doubt.    The visits became less frequent to the point it became a treat when the office moved location and we had a dedicated colleague do the sandwich runs every other month or so.  She even had a spreadsheet with everyone's orders and pre-ordered the sandwiches ahead of time for pickup.  The sandwich system was what she called it and we loved it.  I remembered the queue used to be very intimidating and ordering reminds me of the Seinfeld episode of the soup nazi, but I would always order my usual veal and eggplant on a kaiser bun with everything except hot peppers and extra sauce.  Credit goes to the staff for moving the line quickly and working methodically with one another, but sometimes they do make mistakes when someone takes too long and the order gets messed up which ruins the assembly line.  I loved the veal and eggplant sandwich so much that I would always be able to finish the whole sandwich no problem, that's the bonus of being active and a big eater because these sandwiches do get soggy and probably won't taste good for dinner and definitely not the next day.  Although, I cannot say for sure as I never have any leftovers....haha  On a recent visit, a friend and I went  during late afternoon (well after the lunch rush), so there was no lineup, no problem ordering and since we had a late breakfast, we decided to share the sandwich.  Good thing we shared because what a disappointment the sandwich was.  The kaiser bun tasted a little stale and the sauce was too salty (luckily I forgot to order extra sauce).  It definitely didn't look or taste like the sandwich which I was accustomed to and used to love.  Thankfully the veal and eggplant were still lightly battered and tender in taste.  It was just a shame that it wasn't a tasty sandwich that I enjoyed, perhaps we should have ordered during the lunch rush as maybe that would have changed the flavours and freshness of the sandwich.  I think not, because a good place should have good food  all the time no matter what time of day.  I think I'll just stick to Bitondo or San Francesco in Little Italy. Now they do veal and eggplant sandwiches right all the time."}
{"text":"Ive been hear a couple of times and have generally enoyed the sandwiches.  I have heard they are a heartattack in a bun though so I try to limit my visits!"}
{"text":"Afer reading all the reviews here, I HAD to make the stop on my recent trip to Toronto. The first time we went there they were out of Veal!!! Crap! We went somewhere else and made plans to come back for the touted veal and eggplant sandwich. There was a stack of veal in the window so we figured we were in luck and ordered one to share. I gotta say it was just ok. The veal was dry. Sorry but dry veal has no charm, the sauce was good, the bread decent but I had to ask myself if any of those who wrote the rave reviews knew anything about a good veal sandwich, or they were just having a bad day at Mustachio's. Nothing offensive or overpriced but, so not worth the calories. We had a much nicer veal sandwich at Cafe Diplomatico. When I get the address etc. I will write that review. Still scratching my head over the raves for this place."}
{"text":"While this place is known for their sandwiches, and while their sandwiches are really tasty. They also serve pasta! And a lot of it, for cheap! It's about $5 (for just sauce and cheese) and you get a substantial amount of it. The pasta is pretty good too!  Another one of my regular lunch options as it is very affordable for what you get!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to get a veal or eggplant sandwich.  Huge portions, lots of toppings and wonderful foccacia bread.  Make sure you get your sandwhich on foccacia, you will not be dissapointed.  These sandwich are meant for one REALLY hungry person or two to share.  One sandwich on foccacia bread is $8, a great price for what you are getting.  Make sure you stop by Uno Mustachio at the lower level of the St Lawrence market for a yummy sandwhich."}
{"text":"Had a typical Saturday morning, concluding with a wonderful eggplant sandwich at Mustachio - with mushrooms, peppers, onions and spicy tomato sauce, delicious!!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite eggplant sandwich in the city.  Love the focaccia, peppers, and mushrooms.  It's tasty, it's huge and perfect for sharing.  My only lament is that they don't have other locations!"}
{"text":"Uno is one of those places that's always been there.  They were with me from childhood through college, and temporarily forgotten.  I recently remembered them via RITUAL.  I rolled up like a VIP.  (not like my college days scrounging around for cash)  I had the eggplant veal, the works.  The toppings great.  The bun typical.  The sauce just right.  If you order at the start of the lunch hour, when the veal and eggplant are just out of the fryer, pure perfection.  As the lunch hour moves along, the breading gets softer and some of the things you want may sellout.  Prices have gone up over the years, but it's expected.  9.50 for my sandwich.  I remember it being bigger and more filling.  I finished the whole thing by myself quite easily.  Still a solid italian sandwich.  I'm glad I remembered them."}
{"text":"So disappointing. The veal sandwich was chewy, soggy, bland, and the sauce was a tad too sweet. Horrible experience!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my eggplant and chicken parm sandwich there so much I hit it up twice in one weekend. It was a tremendous value, especially with the $5 discount I got by ordering online from Ritual. The sandwiches are big enough for two meals. I had a great order experience both times, with my order ready and waiting within a few minutes of submitting it online. There was a problem with the order processing the second time, and guy behind the counter was cool about it and assumed that the order was processed while whipping up my sandwich quickly. Note: they ran out of some of the most popular ingredients near the end of the day - I think it was steak."}
{"text":"I picked up a veal and eggplant parmigiana sandwich the other day and I was impressed. $8 gets you a huge sandwich that's guaranteed to satiate even the largest of appetites.   I went during off-peak hours, so the line wasn't too bad. There was a line of approximately 10 people an hour earlier. Even with the line, service is pretty quick and efficient. Friendly? Maybe not so much.   I believe Uno Mustachio excels in its breading and deep frying. Both the veal and eggplant are thinly sliced and breaded. They maintain excellent crunch without being too greasy.  Like others have mentioned, I'd opt-in for the hot peppers. They really add a much appreciated heat element to the sandwich. The peppers also add some moisture to the sandwich. A common minor complaint is that the sandwich is a bit on dry side. Asking for peppers or extra sauce helps.  Overall, a very good parmigiana sandwich. I don't think it gets much better. I still give the nod to California Sandwiches, since I enjoy their red sauce and freshness. Sometimes I feel the sandwiches at Uno Mustachio end up sitting under the heat lamp and lose some flavor as a result. Try to get a fresh one."}
{"text":"Let the haters hate, but as you can see by the longest line in the market, easily 50 people at 11:30, the people have spoken and these sandwiches rock. Fresh buns, brought in fresh every morning. Homemade sauce, too dry? Get extra sauce you f---ing babies! Ugh Everything is fried just minutes before you eat it, see the line of 2 guys in the back of the kitchen, guess what they're doing? Frying crisp scallopinis of met and veg. Sorry if you show up after 2 you're gonna get something that was fried at 1.   You missed the boat get with the program, this is the the st Lawrence market, and it's been done this way since 1800, it's the program, deal with it.   Service rude, well thats how you move that 50 person line up, that's how you sell 2000 sandwiches a day, have you ever been to a NY deli? Clearly not and don't even think about going to Boston they might make you cry.  This is a solid, crispy, huge, consistent, delicious Italian sandwich that is an institution in Toronto. And like all famous institutions, they really don't care about the whiners. Go eat your cafe sandwich and get your ass kissed by some college waiter you just wants NEWSFLASH your tip.  Park your ego this is the market and it ain't changing, because Toronto LOVES IT!!!!"}
{"text":"If you're craving a chicken or veal parmigiana sandwich, get in your car and drive yourself to the St. Lawrence market. This sandwich spot has been around for a very long time and for good reason. They have 3 standard sandwiches - veal, chicken and eggplant - all placed on a freshly baked bun with cheese priced at $12.88. The sandwiches are all really filling (my wife and I normally split 1) and you can have your choice of roasted peppers, jalapeños, mushrooms and onions. If you are REALLY hungry, try the godfather sandwich...it is veal or chicken plus eggplant...you likely won't eat another meal the rest of the day!  Do yourself a favour...get a sandwich from here before the end of the day."}
{"text":"Get here early as there's definitely going to be a line for the lunchtime rush. Good sized veal parm for $10 (including tax). Includes all the main toppings (parm, onions, peppers) for no additional price."}
{"text":"I just returned back to the states after a week in Toronto and am already craving a eggplant sandwich. I had one for lunch almost every day. The best thing I've ever eaten? Not by a longshot, but I enjoy down a dirty food and this fits the bill. The service is a bit \"soup nazi\". Fortunately I went with somebody that knew the drill so I made it through without too much grief. Watch out for the preprepared sandwiches as they just aren't the same, bad idea mustachio.  Yes it is breaded, deep fried eggplant on a big ass roll. The sauce and other veggies made it for me. It is just a darn good sandwich.  I split one with my girlfriend and my belly was more than satisfied. If you don't like street food this isn't the place for you, not fancy pants by any stretch."}
{"text":"Like Kat F. I was compelled to offer up my thoughts for Mustachio's because I'm tired of hearing their praise through the grapevine. The sandwich on a scale of 1 to 10 would garner a 3.5 in my books on a great day.   The sandwich is stacked to the point that it just falls apart no matter how you try to eat. Sure their cutlets of veal, chicken and eggplant are massive, but they are bland and sit under heat lamps all day. What really dissapoints me most about this place, other than the praise that some ppl give them, is their tomato sauce. It is so bland I would not be surprised if it comes out of a can. Uuggh..  Honestly, if you look through my reviews you'll notice I rarely write up bad reviews on places, I feel mostly compelled to offer up reviews when establishments sweep me off my feet, but Mustachio's is really that bad. It is so bland I couldn't even finish my last sandwich.   Cali sandwiches puts this place to shame, it's no surprise that there are CS popping up all over the city and that there are always lines.  If anyone wants to argue that Mustachio's is better than Cali then pls let me know and we can organize an eat off."}
{"text":"2.5 stars - huge sandwich, good price, tastes alright but kind of oily.  I usually get the Veal & Eggplant which is really what Uno is famous for. The chicken or veal slice is huge but deep fried. This is where things go off for me. Once you add the eggplant which is also deep fried, I find the sandwich is too oily / fried. They used to have a grilled chicken option but I dont see it on the menu anymore.  The sandwich is served with tomato sauce, onions, peppers and some other options. I find the bun is rather dry (but no worry - it will be soggy by the time your done from the tomato sauce).   Portion is ridiculously large and good value for the money.  It gets busy on a weekday at lunch - this is a common destination for the office towers. The lunch line look's crazy, but moves quickly.   Warning - staff expect you to know what you want, they are trying to move the line quickly and don't appreciate lots of questions / indecision.  P.S. - I tried the pasta as well - also 2.5 star rated.  BK"}
{"text":"A few times a year I get the chance to drop into Mustachio to get an eggplant sandwich.  Typically I order from one person who puts what I want on it and I get what I asked for. Today there was a man that asked me for my order then told the other guy what I want. Unfortunately inevitably, there is a breakdown in communication when one person tells something to another person. After years of coming to the same place and asking for the same thing, they got my order wrong because they decided to fix a process that was never broken."}
{"text":"Great place to get a Italian chicken or veal parm with eggplant.  Toppings are included in the price.  Ask for extra sauce!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, this is often my go to place for my Friday night cheat meal, i'll slip out of work a little early (3pm,) because sadly they start closing early and these Sammy's go damn fast. Showing up late means you'll have to pick through what's left, which is still pretty good, but they don't compare to the freshly made and very awesome \"Godfather\" sandwich which is served on a fresh Kaiser bun, along with sautéed, onions, green peppers, mushrooms and hot peppers, provolone cheese, tomato sauce, then layered with either chicken or veal along with their delicious fried eggplant and then finally dusted with parmesan, so good...   This Sammy is massive and extremely filling, for the price, you get more than enough food. I can eat my fair share, and I can barely finish this sandwich. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place :)"}
{"text":"Get the veal eggplant sandwich with the works.  This sandwich not only tasted great.  It gave me energy I never knew I had.  Eating this sandwich actually enhanced the experience of the St. Lawrence market for me.  This guy has a batch of home-made tomato sauce on the stove which he puts on the sandwich. There really is nothing else quite like it."}
{"text":"Do you like California Sandwiches (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/california-sandwiches-toronto-2)???   MUSTACHIO sandwiches are SO MUCH BETTER!  I'm all about the chicken and eggplant... The sauce is tasty. The breading doesn't crumble. The bun doesn't fall apart. Plus all the extras are FREE! GIVE IT ALL TO ME BABY! (Minus the hot peppers at times...)  And this is the kicker... I don't have that gross feeling in the pit of my stomach after devouring one of these bad boys! Mmmmm baby MMMM!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots at the St. Lawrence market. I order the godfather sandwich (around $10), it comes with both veal parm and eggplant parm, onions, green peppers, mushrooms and hot peppers.  Portions are HUGE. The sauce is simple and delicious and the breading is nice and light."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday around 1 and there was a line up of about 10 people, but it moved quickly. I ordered the chicken sandwich with onions, mushrooms and jalapeños which are included and my friend ordered the chicken parm and they forgot the cheese. The sandwich was big, but overall pretty disappointing. The chicken was paper thin and the sauce and toppings were decent. I didn't love it, but maybe I needed to try the chicken parm or chicken and eggplant for more substance. Will give it another try. The workers were pretty friendly, but rush you through your order."}
{"text":"In my quest to continue trying different places for fast lunches in the financial district, I found some rave reviews of this place. I'd say this place is average.  I got the eggplant and chicken  sandwhich $7 and change Let me paint you the picture.  Long line up but the people behind the counter are quick.  Once they say  yell \"next order\" at you, you better yell your order right back, followed by a \"please\"  The woman slaps on a mixture of tomato sauce, onions mushrooms and then 1 breaded chicken+ 2 breaded eggplant.  It's massive.  2 meals for sure. While the poeple behind the counter aren't especially nice, they do have an Italian charm to them that makes you smile  Now you unwrap your delightful sandwich, but the flavour is less than a taste explosion.  Maybe I'm too spoiled with the ridiculously fatty sauces they put on EVERYthing these days, but there's something very bland about the toppings. However, if you pick apart the sandwhich and eat it one ingredient at a time, it IS rather good.  the chicken ad eggplant? fab.  the bread- I never order white bread anymore, let alone a kaiser bun..but i have to say the pedestrian nature of it was a pleasant experience.  The tomato sauce is good.  and they don't load any spices (not even pepper or salt) to season any of the toppings/ingredients.  It's a simple and decent sandwhich.  That being said, I would not go again."}
{"text":"Wow. I hope they didn't added the \"Uno\" to Mustachio on Yelp to get a better rating from their other rating? I'll put in my 2¢ here as well.  I had the chicken sandwich and I wished they made it fresh instead of the protein being displayed. It tastes like day old sandwiches microwaved. It's pretty dry, which is why they need more sauce on the sandwiches. I've had much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had the veal and eggplant sandwich today at Mustachio... and it was yummy!  The warnings are correct, the sandwich is quite filling and I could only finish half.  I also got a Greek Salad as I needed my veggie fix.  For around $5 the salad is of a substantial size.  The breading is flavourful and provides a nice crunch to the sandwich.  The eggplant is mandolin-thin and very fresh.  My only complaints were that the bun was a bit on the dry side, and cold.  They could've also been a bit more generous with the marinara sauce which would've upped the flavour of the sandwich.  The Greek Salad was made with fresh ingredients and drizzled in an olive oil vinaigrette.  All in all, my stomach and wallet were satisfied with the $13.99 price tag."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are decent and they're enormous - I'll give them that. But last time I went was a weekday before the lunch hour and I guess they weren't very busy because the cashier (whom I saw handle money) made my sandwich bare-handed without washing his hands and then proceeded to cash me out. Totally unacceptable! Not going back."}
{"text":"Holy spicy!!!  I had the hot sausage with cheese and mushrooms and my goodness, so hot.  Very delicious though and very filling.  That being said though, and maybe I'm a bit biased because the first ever Italian sandwich I ever had was from California Sandwiches but I like Cali's better.  They do something with the sausage that just makes it taste way better.  Plus it's a sloppy mess which I love about Cali's.  This place was good and much spicier but not as much sauce and just not up to my par.  Very quick service though and a lot of options.  Price is basically what you would expect.  If you're not the best with spicy, definitely go for the medium."}
{"text":"I visited St. Lawrence Market specifically to try Uno Mustachio's since I've heard so many great things about this place. I ordered the Veal Parma Eggplant sandwich that came with cheese, mushroom, sautéed onions and hot peppers. The sandwich costed $9.75 and was huge! I was hungry but couldn't finish it all so I'm glad that they cut the sandwich in half so I was to easily save some of it for later. However, I did find the sandwich a bit dry so I wish I asked for extra sauce on it. There also isn't a lot of seating near the restaurant so it's best to buy it then head upstairs where there are more seats."}
{"text":"I don't like eggplant. I never eat veal. But the veal and eggplant sandwich at Mustachio has a hold on me. It's inexplicable. And I can't wait to get my hands on one the next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Five stars hands down.   I come at least once a week and order a veal godfather fully loaded. Which translates into a Veal Parma eggplant with mushrooms, onions, and jalapeños. This is a big sandwich so make sure your hungry.   Yes the staff are a bit short on patience, but how hard could it be to order a sandwich? Be prepared when the assembler asks you for your order. Say it clearly and move on to the cash without hesitation. I actually enjoy the soup nazi like vibe especially since it moves the lines quite quickly. Even a 20 person line-up clears in less than 8-10 minutes.   I usually park on Market street (illegally) and run in to grab the above sandwich. By the time I make it back home or to my office the sandwich has had about 10 minutes to \"settle\". By that point the sandwich has absorbed some of the tomato sauce without getting soggy.   Overall this is a great spot for a cheap but epic lunch."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on Thursday. It was packed with tourists and people who work in the area. We waited in line for a good twenty minutes. I love chicken cutlet sandwiches so I often go to California Sandwiches, this place might become the new place that I go to! The line for this place is long and I now know why - their sandwiches are really tasty!  My mum ordered the spaghetti and she said that it was pretty good as well. The prices here are quite reasonable. This place is cash only so you can't use your credit or debit cards here.  Good for: out of towners, lunch"}
{"text":"Here is a simple test to tell how to rate these sandwiches...  Go buy one... don't unwrap it... and take it to work.  Just as you are about to go to your work space, unwrap it... when you reach your desk see how many people are smelling the air and asking 'do you smell that'?  (in a good way)  Simple flavors, a fantastic sandwich, with all Italian flavors.    Only down side, you may not notice its on the salty side.  I have fun taking this item down to the financial district.  Where people wonder about the executives love the look of a delicious sandwich."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet! This place has arguably the best sandwiches in the downtown core. The veal sandwich is great, and even better when you throw some deep fried eggplant in the mix with it. Yes, it is food coma inducing and probably not the healthiest thing in the world, but damn is it ever tasty. Although fair warning - best ordered with extra sauce, as they've been a bit on the dry side without."}
{"text":"It's difficult to tell the difference between a good Italian sandwich and an okay one, but I'd say uno moustachio got enough of the details right to be a good one. I had the veal sandwich and it didn't leave me feeling dehydrated from sodium the way sandwiches from California sandwich sometimes do. They also let you choose your vegetables as part of the sandwich price which is a nice change from other competitors. Lastly, it has a cool vibe located on the basement floor of the St.Lawrence market. Think I've found my new sandwich place."}
{"text":"Yeah, yeah, I know.  You Torontonians are really quite tired of us transplanted 'Mericans (especially those of us who have the privilege, the honor, the urban distinction, of being New Yorkers) comparing our nations, our cities, our food.  And, you know, I totally get and understand that.  No, really I do.   Consider Michelle Bachman.  But in this case, and in the words of my mother, \"tough.\"  Because I finally found an Italian sandwich mecca that, yo, takes me right back to da streets backs home in Brooklyn.  Like, fuckin 'A.  Located in the lower tier of Toronto's famous St. Lawrence Market, Uno Mustachio is clearly one of the most popular eateries in the entire historic building.  Swarming with tourists and sharply dressed business workers during the lunch rush, you might want to grab your il pranzo molto delizioso to go.  Why?  Seating is incredibly limited and so tightly packed that this isn't the place to be if you're claustrophobic, especially while you're trying to keep the sauce and mushrooms from slipping onto your shirt.  Sure, they serve a nice variety of pasta and salad dishes, but the cooks here are Italian sandwich specialists.  Chicken parmigiano, veal, eggplant, meatball, chicken with eggplant, veal with eggplant, steak and cheese, steak with cheese and eggplant, all served on kaisers with your choice of hot peppers, sweet peppers, onions and/or mushrooms for garnish.  My tastebuds were immediately reminded of the corner shops in Bay Ridge and Bensonhoist. (Ok, maybe not the steak and cheese... that's more Philadephia, but you get the point.)  For real Brooklyn effect, make sure you ask for double tomato sauce. Beverages include the usual canned or bottled variety, plus Italian favourites like SanPellegrino and Brio.    And if you needed even more good advice about this place, consider what the father of a family of four kids said to his wife as they chowed down next to me:  \"Hey.  It must be good.  Nobody's talking.\"  Fuckin' 'A right it is."}
{"text":"There's a reason Mustachio is constantly busy (don't even think of trying to go there for lunch unless you have time to spare).   Their veal and eggplant sandwiches are to die for - thin slices of eggplant and tender pieces of veal coated in a light breadcrumb crust fried to perfection smothered with tangy tomato sauce and topped with mozzarella cheese, sauteed green peppers and onions and encased in a fresh Italian bun.   Whew! It's certainly a delicious mouthful."}
{"text":"Love their veal and egg plant sandwich. The veal and egg plant are perfectly breaded then fried resulting in a delicious, crispy morsel with every bite.  The sandwich is also huge and not drenched with sauce, which is a big deal for me.  I personally don't like my veal sandwiches with too much sauce, as I find it masses the taste. Uno Mustachio does it right, which is probably why this place always has a line.  Note: they don't have their own seating, so you are at the mercy of finding one of the communal tables, and you definitely need to be siting down to enjoy their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I liked the staff more than the sandwich. The veal is very thin, bun too big for this amount/quantity of meat. Sauce average, a one time visit. Plus almost 10 bucks w cheese, no deal here."}
{"text":"Love their veal eggplant sandwich and great location... I love taking the occasional lunch break and walking over for a sandwich..."}
{"text":"I've been to the St. Lawrence Market more times than I can count but only tried Uno Mustachio for the first time recently. I had a classic veal sandwich and it was nice. The sandwich came with a tasty tomato sauce as well as some peppers and onions. It ended up being $10 even, which was a fair price. The staff was friendly. Only thing I didn't love was how much bread the sandwich had."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly Italian sandwich dealer? I like it. Menu is clear and easy to read \"uno, due, tre\" menu. Either one, two, or three fillings - veal, chicken, or eggplant parmigiana or meatball sandwiches. I went with veal parm and it was delicious, full of peppers and onions and fresh jalapeños which gave it just the right kick. With a drink I was just over ten bucks, and that's just fine with me."}
{"text":"The gf and were by the market last weekend looking for new condos when we decided to have a bite here.   Ordered the chicken eggplant parmigiana sandwich on a bun with onions and mushrooms $8.99  One word: TASTELESS ! when you bite on the damn thing you can't taste anything but the batter and some sauce. Chicken tasted like mass and eggplant seemed non existent despite being there. The size is big, but its not enough. Taste is king and this one fails miserably."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and it's been pretty consistent. I love getting the veal parm with eggplant and cheese cause it has a nice veal flavour with the lightly breaded eggplant, cheese and I get mine with hot peppers to round it all off.  The place also has good service, the people there are nice and always pretty helpful.  The sandwich is pretty big, and is a good eat in the St. Lawrence Market."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. I was at the market thinking Peameal, until I went downstairs and decided to hit Mustachio's.  Got the veal and eggplant sammy - fantastic! Lots of sandwich, good toppings, perfect sauciness, all around a great, cheap spot to eat for lunch."}
{"text":"Uno Mustachio's specialty would be their Veal & Eggplant Parmagiana ($8 - $9sh) - comes with Peppers & Mushrooms on Focaccia. This sandwich's HUGE - most people can't even finish it. Their breading isn't that thick, which's good since you can still taste the veal & eggplant. The bread's fresh, however they need to put more sauce in the sandwich; It's a bit dry (just ask for extra sauce). However, the meat, veggie, sauce & bread all blend in very nicely.  Overall - You'll get your food decently fast - 6 mins or so. The portion's freaking huge and the sandwich's pretty good.            **3 1/2 stars overall**"}
{"text":"I don't know. I feel people hype this place up that my expectation was very high. But sadly, I was slightly disappointed with my sandwich. Even though the sandwich was big with lots of sauce, I feel like it lacked some flavor. There wasn't any kick to it. I got the \"uno\" classic veal sandwich for almost $8. That's pretty steep for just a sandwich. The meat wasn't flavorful or juicy. I asked for everything on my sandwich, but the guy only put onions and peppers, no mushrooms. I didn't noticed until I started eating the sandwich. This place must be doing something right because the line was long during lunch time. Unfortunately it wasn't a big hit for me."}
{"text":"Ducked down here from work for a quick lunch. As it was a Wednesday, it wasn't too busy.   You definitely have to go for one of the Italian sandwiches. They are very generous on the fillings and even though the filling is crumbed, it didn't taste greasy or overly oily. We got a chicken and eggplant parmigiana sandwich. We omitted the peppers and onions but did get the mushrooms. They then slather some italian tomato sauce on it.  Check out my picture for a cross section of our sandwich. I had to share it with my husband. The flavours went very nicely together. The photo doesn't do it justice though but atleast you can see the really thinly cut crumbed chicken and eggplant slices.  The kaiser roll it comes in is perfect because it is crunchy on the outside but not tough to chew through like ciabata.  I was worried it would be really messy to eat but it was fine, no drips or soggy bits.  Now we don't really have sandwiches like this in Sydney but I've noticed that italian sandwiches are big in Toronto especially ones with meatballs in it. So I guess I'm no expert, but I do know yummy food when it goes in my mouth!  Love love love this place. Counting down the days until I can go back ... need to leave enough time between visits so I don't look like a glut!"}
{"text":"I been here a couple of times one of the best veal and eggplant Parmesan sandwiches I have ever tasted the veal sandwich is ginormous it's hard to finish not for me though. The sauce is the right amount of consistency and the veal is so tender with the onions and the peppers. This place is legit"}
{"text":"Mustachio's Italian sandwiches are the best in the city.  Previous reviewers have trumpeted about the veal and eggplant sandwiches, but it's the chicken sandwich that really does it for me.    Thin chicken, potentially even a little dry, but with their wonderful sauce, the balance of tastes is perfect.  The sandwich comes on a huge bun with all the sauteed onions, peppers and mushrooms you could want.  Definitely a meal all in itself.   Service is friendly, but very prompt.  The lines are long, so you will feel guilty if you slow them down.  Getting a seat in prime time is pretty much unheard of (and that is with \"seat\" being defined as \"anywhere in the market\") so be prepared to take out.   My only complaint is their hours... I want their sandwiches for more than just breakfast and lunch -- stay open later!"}
{"text":"This place is solid. They do sandwiches right. Pair your veal sandwich with a Brio and you're good to go.   Friendly staff, quick service, and consistent quality."}
{"text":"For an Italian food loving traveler from Hawaii Mustachio was a dream come true.   After perusing stall after stall of beautiful food I wandered downstairs into the bowels of St. Lawrence market. It's there that I found this gem. High quality, simple food, cooked to perfection.   Even if the rest of the market totally sucked (which it of course doesn't), even if I had to fly 5000 miles again to get here (it'll only be 2000 something once I move to Portland), it'd be worth it to eat Mustachio's \"Veal and Eggplant Sandwich\".    note: I often think the tourist reviews for people visiting Hawaii are a bit silly and over exagerrated....yeah, who's the tourist now? =P  So what's so special about this sandwich? Well for starters we can't get them in Hawaii, but the main reason is that they're just really damn good.  Check out Jennifer N.'s well crafted description (I'm feeling lazy and she does a great job): http://www.yelp.ca/biz/mustachio-toronto#hrid:7N5lQTa7ahvuTXgP3-IsLg  What edible bliss looks like: http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/yo15fcktzqiJGdnXYxHabA?select=87zF1xNsptSGWAZLntovng  I don't know when I'll be in Toronoto next, but when I am I'll certainly be stopping here."}
{"text":"Heads up this place is located on the bottom floor of St Lawrence market.  Cash only..., but thankfully they accept Ritual. Was able to order and pay on my phone avoiding wait times. Great service, was fairly quick for lunch rush.   Tried the Classic Eggplant, with all the toppings, and extra sauce. Even after a 5 minute walk the sandwich was still intact. Multiple layers of fried eggplant, with mushrooms, peppers, onions, and jalapeno's, in tomato sauce. Tomato sauce was okay but wasn't a deal breaker.     Overall I enjoyed it. Large portion size. The bun was soft and soaked up most of the sauce. And the toppings and eggplant were fresh. Would recommend, and willing to trying their Godfather variant and pastas.   ** Would recommend ordering on the app. If your eating outside stock up on napkins."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today to try the veal parma sandwich. It was nothing special, the veal didn't taste anything out of the ordnary and the fillings (onion, sweet pepperm mushrooms and hot peppers) were quite bland and boring. At $9 I felt it was a rip off."}
{"text":"Ordered veal and eggplant parma sandwich and it was  delicious! The eggplant and cheese were the perfect combination and wouldnt mind eating it the whole day. We also got Godfather's pasta and it was perfection! That was the best tasting italian pasta ive had in a while. The noodles were perfectly cooked as well. The pasta had a lot of meat which is a big plus for me."}
{"text":"Had the chicken parmigiana. Enjoyed the sandwich but a little pricey. Overall, i will be back when in the area. Staff were very quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Looking for a great sandwich? This place has the best Italian sandwiches in Toronto hands down. $8.00 gets you a 'loaded' sandwich and $10 (gets you a couple of couple of extra toppings like cheese) I had the 'chicken and eggplant sandwich loaded with onions, peppers, mushroom, tomato sauce and cheese. These masterpieces easily feed 2 people. The service is fast, the food here is made fresh everyday, and there is a very good selection to choose from. If you are in St Lawrence and have a craving for an authentic Italian sandwich, stop here, but bring CASH as they do not accept debit or credit cards!"}
{"text":"Let's just say the chicken and eggplant on focaccia is a carb overload celebration.  I have never been able to do a whole sandwich.  And I wish they had hot sauce because although I always get peppers, it could still use a little extra zing to balance all that breading.  But that is a small complaint.  I am sure some people find the employees a little gruff.  Just know what you want before you get in line.  Be no bullshit when you order and you'll have no problems.  Heck, I have even been gifted a two-for-the-price-of-one deal without ever dreaming to ask, but again, that was only at the very end of the day.  As is true with most things, timing is everything."}
{"text":"After a while, I got tired of the many chain fast food places that populated the downtown core.  I wanted something unique and not cookie cutter.  My coworker suggested we head over to the SLM and go into the basement for Mustachio.  Seeing how most of my lunches are in basements, why on earth would I go here?  She was telling me how I'm missing out on a great experience.  So other than being told to go hungry and be ready to eat... I had no clue what I was going to get a sandwich the size of my face.  I love SLM but it's rare that I get a chance to pop on over from where I live.  Thankfully it's close to the Financial District and you can walk there easily in the summer.  Mustachio is in the basement of the SLM and I wasn't sure why my coworker suggested we leave at 11:30 but I soon found out why.  The line up here is nuts.  When we got there at 11:45 am, the line up was already snaked up twice around.  The counter is filled with people yelling, talking, and just grabbing and slinging food everywhere.  I saw the foccaccia bread they were using and I was shocked.  I think my mouth dropped as my co-worker said 'told you to come hungry'.  It is the size of my face... this is no exaggeration either.  I quickly scanned the menu and it's good old Italian hot plate sandwiches.  Veal, chicken, and eggplant sandwich on your choice of bread.  They're big, breaded, and loaded with sauteed onions, mushrooms, and peppers.  It's also sauced to heck.  Do not wear white when you eat a sandwich from here because it will be easily apparent that you did.  The line moved very fast for such a long time.  I think we only waited maybe 8 or 10 minutes max.  We paid for our giant sandwiches and headed to the outdoor patio of the SLM.  As I unwrapped the sandwich, I was imagining a juicy bite of my eggplant with a combination of tender vegetables and a bit of a bite from the breading.  Close... but not the full picture.  I managed to squirt the table with tomato sauce while losing half the veggies out the bottom.  It was fun to eat it but oddly enough everything was really soft.  The breading on the eggplant seemed stale or sitting around too long and it had no crunch or texture.  The seasoning of everything was too subtle.  It almost felt underseasoned.  The onions and tomato provided a bit of flavour but not enough to enhance the eggplant.  It could have used salt.. pepper... anything.  It was kinda bland sadly.  The price of my sandwich makes this a great option for hungry people. I think I paid $6 for a ridiculously huge sandwich with real vegetables and not filling.  This is one of the best options in Financial District but it's sadly it's not a great option either.  I'll keep searching around for that perfect lunch spot in the downtown core."}
{"text":"Mustachio's makes the best veal sandwiches you can dream of. Everyone has been bothering me about California Sandwiches my whole life, and I couldn't care less about them. Mustachio's beats that place so hard, because they have delicious sandwiches, fast service, and...uh, the best sandwiches ever that you should have immediately (as in right now).  Here's what you will do:  You will go to Mustachio's, and you will wait in line. When it's your turn, you will get a veal and eggplant sandwich. You'll ask for everything on it (including hot peppers), and your mouth might be on fire for a little bit, but later on, you will appreciate this tip because it makes the sandwich even better.  You'll go sit outside on the picnic benches of St. Lawrence Market on a nice day, and eat your Mustachio sandwich, and you will think, \"Wow, this is the best sandwich I have ever had. The veal is so lean and is the perfect thin cut of meat that has ever been breaded and fried. Why is this eggplant so deliciously crispy and tasty? And how is this bread so fresh? This sandwich is so amazing that I don't even care if I spill its contents on my jeans, I will probably pick them up and eat them anyways.\"  And then you will think, \"I am so glad I searched for the best veal sandwich ever on Yelp. Now that I know Mustachio's is here, my life will never be the same.\""}
{"text":"Located on the lower floor of St. Lawrence Market, Uno Mustachio is one of THE most popular places in the entire building (perhaps with the exception of Buster's Sea Cove), judging by the crazy long line. Luckily, they have a good system going and are able to move the line quickly because their sandwich options are pretty simple and basic. You get either one, two, or three items on your sandwich (i.e. eggplant, veal, etc.), as well as any of four toppings. I ordered a veal parma eggplant and my friend ordered I think something with chicken - each of the sandwiches was less than $10 after tax and they were both HUGE. Despite that, they are really easy to eat because the breading on the veal is so light and thin, I LOVED IT. Maybe I was just super hungry that day, but I inhaled that beast, and thoroughly enjoyed every bite. I mean don't get me wrong, it's definitely a super filling meal, but you won't feel too gross and fatty afterwards even though it's quite a lot of fried food in one sandwich. But I didn't find it greasy at all, and actually it was deliciously flavourful too with the toppings and tomato sauce... ugh just so good, MUST TRY."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said before. This St. Lawrence Market stable runs like a well-oiled machine. I always have their eggplant sandwiches which are packed to the heavens with a pile of pan-fried eggplant and a selection of toppings, including mushrooms, onions, peppers and tomato sauce. They are big and sloppy and delicious and are a must for anyone in the market. I am told the veal sandwiches are just as good, a friend always has one, when I have an eggplant sandwich. Just enjoy the ambiance and experience, but arrive hungry."}
{"text":"I've only ever had their eggplant sandwich, and that's the only thing I will ever want-need-crave from them.  It is a filling sandwich, great for people with big hands.  Those with smaller hands will find themselves getting a.. good bang for their buck here.    The price of their popular sandwiches keep going up.  I will occasionally allow myself to keep buying their eggplant sandwich, though.  Life wouldn't be the same if I didn't have the freedom to munch and crunch on their more-crunchy-than-soggy deep-fried breaded eggplant yumminess, loaded with extra veggies -- onions, green peppers, and a leaf of lettuce and slice of fresh tomato as well.  They offer it on either \"focaccia\" bread or on a big bun (maybe you can wear baseball or oven mitts, if you like me have small hands).  A very suitable 'wich for Wolverine if ever you're lucky enough to interact verbally w/ him.  One half of their hefty sandwich usually does the trick in keeping my belly full.  Maybe bring along another friend?  That way, you'll be leaving enough room for some fresh fruit or whatever small dessert-like nibblies that your heart may be desiring.  Maybe some cubes of cheese from one of the cheese shops, or a very freshly baked bagel from St. Urbain bagels.  You'll find tons of snack options at St. Lawrence Mkt.  Mustachio is located on the basement level of the St. Lawrence Market South building.  Closed Sundays, methinks.  4.5 stars.  Let me know if their prices ever drop."}
{"text":"It was for sure better than the famous \"bacon\" spot in the same building. It was a bit on the pricey side for a sandwich, but I think it was worth the wait the money. The meat and the eggplant were both very flavorful and juicy."}
