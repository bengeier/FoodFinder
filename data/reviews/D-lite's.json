Service tho is horrible"}
{"text":"A little pricey for the food served, D-lite's is a good place for a dairy (Cholov Yisroel) lunch if in the area. The regular menu provides a small selection of thoroughly uninspired breakfast, egg, salad, pasta and other options, but the winner is the gourmet sandwiches. I've tried a few of them and won't order anything else off the menu.

It's unfortunate that the restaurant is usually empty, at least in my experience, but service is usually slow: I've only seen about three of their tables occupied at once, tops, and therefore there's only ever one waiter and one cook. The food is consistent and fresh, service friendly and helpful, and ambience nil.

Sushi menu options are good and surprisingly filling, but definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"I liked the sushi here a lot.  

There's a very large and creative selection of rolls, both cooked and raw, which was a refreshing change. 
The price is decent, standard kosher issue. 
No complaints with the staff or service, they were friendly and accommodating. In fact, our cooked roll was a little overdone and they quickly offered to take it off the bill, no questions asked. 

One issue, however:
Cleanliness. Tables and chairs were dirty and sticky two out of the three times I've visited, so call over the waiter for an extra wipe!"}
{"text":"The sushi selection is great. The service was bad, server barely spoke any english. He said he would bring spices for the poutine on the side, because they don't have spicy poutine, but never did. On top of that another employee  brought us soy sauce for the sushi realized that nozzle wasn't clean, wiped it with the finger and put it in front of us."}
