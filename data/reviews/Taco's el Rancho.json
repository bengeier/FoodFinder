{"text":"Such great food! We always get the pork tacos (omg so good), quesadilla, and hot dogs. Everything is super good. I love that even though it's a food truck they have tables and chairs! Can't wait to eat here again"}
{"text":"Love the Hot Dogs. If you ever get chance stop by and try one. There great. And the Customer Service is 5 Stars as well!!! Super friendly service!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the closest authentic Mexican food truck in Phoenix Arizona no lie. Honestly everything on the menu is beyond delicious (Mouth got watery typing this)

They have one of the best if not the best Sonoran Hot Dogs in Az witch I personally recommend trying out. Tacos are pretty good as well but overall I enjoy their friendly and very welcoming staff. 

They provided better service then a restaurant will hands down'

Keep up the Good work guys!!!!"}
{"text":"Was there tonight and the hotdog is the best that I have ever had. Raped in bacon and then the rest of the topping make the flavor off the chart. Also had some steak tacos. I give them an 8 out of 10. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"This is a great place for tacos. Asada is tender not a lot of fat and toppings to put on your taco are amazing! I enjoyed all three salsas that they had.
What brought me here is the fact that they have hotdogs! I love the fact that I can enjoy a hotdog while also enjoying tacos.
Very friendly staff, and they have a nice clean set up.

The reason for the 4 stars is because I wish the hotdog that was wrapped in bacon was just cooked a little longer or even fried to give it less of a soft texture. Also the bread was really soft which is nice but a little toasting would have been amazing! I will definitely come back for tacos!"}
