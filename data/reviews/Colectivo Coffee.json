{"text":"Excellent food and coffee. I also love their smoothies. The only complaint is that they're music is often unappealing to me, and that it is often very loud in there which makes it hard to study. I love sitting in the 'porch' area during the summer when they open all the walls so it's basically like sitting outside, except with plugs for my laptop charger."}
{"text":"They serve coffee, yeah? Well, that's three stars right there! 
This was one of the things I missed most after moving away from Milwaukee and now they have graced us with their presence in Madison.  We are so very lucky! Great coffee and decent food, too! My favorite sandwich is the avocado B.L.T., but really, I know you can't go wrong with anything that you order.  
They are usually my first stop during the Farmers' Market, because although they are extremely busy, they've got a great system going to make things quick and easy.

The space is nice and spacious, with great outdoor seating, and a view of the Capitol! It can get a bit noisy inside, but what can you expect from a place that is as popular as Colectivo?  They have community tables, great couches, and comfortable chairs that make spending time with friends or getting work done a great experience."}
{"text":"The coffee is bitter tasting. Other places on State St have better tasting coffees. Service was fast. There were several people \"studying\" in the shop even though it was kind of noisy."}
{"text":"It's in a great location, and the layout is pretty cool . . . mostly.
I didn't really appreciate the signs on the tables: \"reserved for groups of 3 or more,\" etc.  I guess the idea is to keep people from hogging a table, but on the other hand, when people are oddly spaced at the longer group tables, how are you supposed to have room for your books and stuff?

I was meeting someone for a job interview and didn't want coffee, so I asked for peppermint tea.  The barista seemed thoroughly unimpressed, and said \"yeah awesome\" made me feel pretty small, like I wasn't cool enough (hipster) to be there.  

The bathrooms are gender neutral, which is very PC, but the sinks are outside of the stalls, which struck me as very unsanitary!

Also, the guy warned me the tea was going to be hot, and OMG he wasn't kidding!  I had to let it sit with the lid off for a good 10 minutes before I could drink it.

Some of the music playing was good, and some was down right terrible!

Maybe if you're more into hipster vibes and fancy coffees, you'd like this place, but next time I'm downtown and need a coffee, I'm likely to skip it."}
{"text":"I've never had as terrible service at a coffee shop as I have here.  A simple drip coffee took more than 20 minutes, the four baristas checking the tip jar more times than they did the waiting orders.  When they finally discovered my order, it took another ten minutes to make.  The coffee itself was not worth the wait.  I wish I could say this is the first time this has happened, but it isn't."}
{"text":"Its just not my thing. Its super loud and always way too packed. The atmosphere is nice so I get its popularity but if I want to go to a coffee shop I'd like a place to sit. The reason I give it two stars is because I think the coffee is not very good. Its kind of bitter and leaves me with an unpleasant aftertaste. I drink a lot of coffee and I might actually prefer a starbucks coffee over this. 

The pastries are defrosted mediocre items. The food is microwaved and low quality. I remember 5 years ago in Milwaukee the food was really good. I wonder if the quality has diminished as it has expanded?"}
{"text":"I ordered a bowl of soup to go.  It was a cold, rainy day and all I wanted was a bowl of hot soup to take back to the office.  It was good soup, but not hot soup since I had to wait 25 minutes for the soup while watching the employees make coffee for fellow employees, change shifts, chat amongst each other, and saunter about.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Love the coffee and decor.
Staff is friendly and service quite good
Only problem I have is noise level. The music is way too loud for a coffee shop where people come to talk, socialize read and study. Makes it hard to have conversation yet alone concentrate if trying to work"}
{"text":"I've only come back to this Colectivo to laugh at their espresso drinks. It's pretty amusing to see the magical shape-shifting macchiatos I've received. I received a macchiato today that had ZERO foam. I'm speechless, and while this Colectivo is in a fantastic and aesthetically-pleasing location that does a pretty good job overall, I have to seriously downgrade them for their apathetic attitude toward bar skills. Quite a departure from what anyone from Milwaukee should come to expect from an otherwise respectable brand. It doesn't deserve the Colectivo name."}
{"text":"This place has an interesting vibe. I'm not entirely a fan of the unfinished design and feel of the space, but it's an interesting route to go. 
I'm not a coffee drinker, but there is plenty of non coffee drinks at Colectivo. I really enjoy their  Italian soda. It's refreshing and not too expensive. 

I do prefer the vibe and experience of the other Colectivo Coffee locations in Madison. They are bigger on the Monroe and Capitol locations, have more outlets, and are a bit less crowded. However, you can't deny that great location on State Street!"}
{"text":"As a longtime Bradbury's patron, I come to Colectivo sometimes because it has later hours, more space, and a bigger food selection. Bradbury's is one of those rare businesses that excels in a niche and doesn't try to expand into everything else. It's great. So Colectivo isn't really a direct competitor in that sense, and fills in pretty well. In short:

Pros: good coffee, bakery, atmosphere, plenty of outside seating

Cons: unbearably crowded at lunch rush and any event on the square, very unreliable / spotty internet access, loud music for a coffee shop

Finally, I'm not sure what the reviewer talking about \"surly staff\" is on about. At JPL, sure. I refuse to go there because I am not myself a barrista and therefore feel unwelcome. Also, I don't want to spend $16 or whatever for a small coffee. But I don't feel any of that vibe at Colectivo...this is a friendly, open to all kind of place. And it serves excellent beer."}
{"text":"I have been going to Colectivo for a long time now and I love their coffee and food (especially the new brie sandwhich). However, the change to no Wifi on the weekends is a big disappointment. I always enjoyed grabbing a coffee and pastry Sunday mornings and sitting for a bit to check emails and read the news. Colectivo is no longer my coffee shop of choice purely because I can't get any work done. I think putting in a wifi password on weekends and just giving a 2 hour limit would be a much more effective solution if the purpose of removing Wifi was to make sure people didn't hang out all day."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Colectivo. They are really invested in the Milwaukee community and I'm super excited to have them in Madison. They really try to take care of their roasters and treat them will respect as well. 

But in addition to them being an awesome organization, they also make delicious coffee! I love their attention to detail and the cute little designs they make in my cortado. They also have delicious bakery and food! Whats not to love?!"}
{"text":"I had never stopped in when this was Alterra, so I was shocked to discover how huge this place is on the inside. Even with all of the seating it never feels like you are right on top of the other patrons, unlike most of the other coffee shops downtown. Lots of power outlets as well if you need to get work done.

I've only visited a few times, but so far the coffee and espresso drinks have all been pretty good and the staff are friendly. Bonus points for having a couple of beer options on a warm autumn afternoon. I suppose your opinion of the music will depend on your age...but I've been happy with the selection."}
{"text":"I've been getting caffeinated at Colectivo for a couple of years and, I SWEAR I posted a review! Well, looks like this review is a long time coming. There are plenty of wonderful places to get coffee on the Capitol Square; however Colectivo is definitely my go-to for specialty coffee drinks. There is nothing quite like wandering the Square during the Dane County Farmer's Market with a tasty dirty, soy chai (2 shots) in hand. Don't let the line snaking out the door fool you; the folks at Colectivo know how to keep the line moving efficiently. And, despite all drinks being made to order with no shortcuts taken, the coffee bar has always made my drink correctly with minimal wait time. The space is warm and inviting and I especially like the large windows that open out to State Street."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in a little over a week. I have had two of the best pour-over coffees I have ever tasted, hands-down! I only order black coffee, and they were amazing. Further their staff is super friendly. Bravo Alterra! Welcome to Madison!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee place in Madison and Milwaukee. Their latte's are by far the best I've ever had. Along with the coffee, I always get the twice baked oatmeal. Delicious and super filling. 

I also have to rave that they use Sassy Cow milk (a local dairy farm) that doesn't use growth hormones in any of their products (organic or otherwise) and that just adds to the wonderful food and drink here. 

The baked goods are also a hit. My husband always get the cinnamon roll, which is coved in icing (not cream cheese) and they serve warm. Cookies, bars, breads, and biscotti are excellent as well. Never tried anything I didn't like.

Definitely check this place out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Finally stopped at this place on a Tuesday at lunch time. Cashier: short guy with pony tail: rude and grumpy. I ordered a cowboy cookie and an espresso shake. The cookie was amazing. Lots of oats and incredibly delicious. The shake was yummm too, but so rich I couldn't finish it. The other 2 employees we encountered were nice, just that one was having a bad day perhaps. It was busy but there was plenty of seating. Will return for more cookies in the future!"}
{"text":"Twice in one week I attempted to use a gift card at this location and was told I would be unable to do so because their system was down. It's been quite inconvenient and the staff wasn't helpful in finding an alternate solution."}
{"text":"I'd been to Alterra several times in Milwaukee and was pumped to hear we were finally getting one in Madison. We went the opening weekend and LOVED it. Highlights... the chorizo burrito. Just do it. The sauce on the side has some delicious spicy kick to it. We ordered a pretzel and it came with real stone ground mustard. Unreal! The mocha I ordered was smooth and delicious. I plan to eat here on Saturdays followed by a trip around the farmers' market... a perfect Saturday morning!! Seriously, everything I've eaten here (and I've been back several times already) has been delicious."}
{"text":"I'm not a coffee drinker, but the location is very convenient. I wish they had a few more teas to chose from, because I've tried a bunch but have only found two that I really enjoyed (Gala and Alchemy-or something). Upstairs is great, but kids doing homework are crowding the place and there aren't many outlets to plug on your electronics. It's a big store, but they fill seats fast! 
Peanut butter bar is good, but nothing amazing. 
Cup of soup is always good. Fast service, hot soup, and you get a side of toast which is really yummy. Favorite soups are the cheesy broccoli and the French onion. 
Pricy, but I guess that's how coffee shops are nowadays. 
No employee recommended their loyalty program to me, so I had to ask if they had punch cards or anything of the sort. Wish I would have known about their point system sooner!
Biggest downside is that the music is always so loud! I like to get a drink and do homework, but it's hard to focus with the music."}
{"text":"While I absolutely love the food at Colectivo, they desperately need to do something about the lack of seating space available for those ordering food. I'm starting to get sick of the people who camp out all day at colectivo with their computers and textbooks and only order one cup of coffee."}
{"text":"If I was going just for coffee and ambiance - four stars! Comfy leather chairs, great windows that open to the streets, and perfect people watching on Farmers' Market Saturdays. They even have their own custom beers, which I LOVE! 

Sadly, I ate there on a busy, rainy Saturday morning and was not impressed by the food. I had the Chorizo breakfast wrap, which was smaller than I was expecting though nicely spicy. My fiance had an everything bagel, which had an overpowering rye taste and was hard on one side. It's what I expect frozen bagels to taste like.

I'd recommend going for a caffeine fix (or beer) and reading. If you're hungry, there are so many better options around the capitol square."}
{"text":"The ambiance here is great.  The view looking out towards state Street and the surrounding area is super cool, especially at night.  Colectivo's coffee blows most everyone else's right out of the water.  Their specialty expresses actually taste like coffee as opposed to sweetened milk.  Way to go, colectivo!"}
{"text":"Hands down favorite coffee shop in Madison! From drip coffee to muffins, it's all good, and reasonably priced. Love that they give 10% off for bike benefits!"}
{"text":"The pineapple in the smoothie was too strong and the brownie looked way better than it tasted."}
{"text":"Yummy and wonderful people watching out the windows. Great spot with a sweet vibe. I like it in the summer when they are open and you can feel that sweet summer breeze."}
{"text":"A regular here so 2 stars for the food and drinks. However, tonight, I was approached by one of the baristas letting me know around 9:45 that Colectivo would be closing soon. It came to my understanding that it was time to pack up and head out. While doing so, the same barista approached me again not even 5 minutes later and said \"we close at 10 so if you could be out of here by then, that would be great\". She came off as rude and unprofessional. If you close at 10, and have a customer walk in at 9:45, would you tell them you're already closed when your hours say 10 and could still tend to a customer? If you're a barista here and upset that you had to close tonight, don't take it out on your customers with a rude approach."}
{"text":"This was a nice place to meet a friend for lunch and coffee.

A previous reviewer mentioned the hipsters. This is a hipster hangout for sure.  I'm not one, so I felt a little out of place.

But! The coffee was excellent, my sandwich was excellent, my chips were ok, and the cookie was excellent.

Felt like I had to yell over the music during my conversation.  The prices are ok as well.  Nice place for a treat once in a while."}
{"text":"Alright... So Madison, I am really glad we got an \"Alterra\" coffee (Milwaukee Represent!) but I am disappointed with the name change... Anyways, this particular place is GREAT, nice spot on the Capital Square with awesome outdoor seating and with a half indoor/outdoor seating area too which is probably my favorite thing because I imagine myself sitting in there on a rainy spring day with my warm cup o'joe as it rained! The inside is standard coffee shop nothing strikes you about in my opinion but the coffee.... the COFFEE... simply scrumtrulescent... yeah... look it up... it is absolutely delicious and I will never describe it well enough for you to understand that so I will not even try. Go enjoy a nice cup of coffee year round at this wonderful corner coffee café."}
{"text":"A great coffee spot on the square. The ambiance is super inviting and the baristas are great. I work on the square and this is a regular coffee spot for my colleagues and me. There is enough space to have a meeting over coffee or lunch! Their food is perfect for a needed snack, breakfast or lunch. 

My regular is an americano, so it's hard to mess that up. But, I do occasionally enjoy a molasses cookie, which is super yummy. Just the right amount of crispness on the edges, yet soft in the middle."}
{"text":"The good: 
- Nice outside seating during the summer
- Okay coffee
- Unique vibe

The bad: 
- No internet on the weekends! What year is this?!! I understand that as a coffee shop you need to increase turnover but this is just bad. Internet also drops off regularly during the week too."}
{"text":"Smallest smalls I have ever seen. Music way too loud, can't even have a real conversation without speaking overly loud. Freezing cold throughout the entire cafe."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great breakfast burritos. All their food is way more fresh than Starbucks and they offer a wider variety of drinks. Colectivo is a Wisconsin gem."}
{"text":"One of my go-to spots for caffeine as well as an exceedingly pleasant place to do a few hours of work. I love the bright and open design of this Colectivo - the large windows provide excellent views of the Square and the outdoor patio is the perfect place to have a morning coffee during the summer months. There is tons of seating here and since it's a decent walk from campus, I've never found it so crowded that I couldn't find a good seat. The Colectivo on State is nice as well but tends to get a little more packed so I prefer the Square location for more peace and quiet. It does get busy here too when there are big events happening on the Square - I made the mistake of coming during Ironman this past summer and it was super crowded and our breakfast burritos took a long time to get to us. It was to be expected though, considering the large crowd that Ironman draws + this Colectivo's prime location on the race course. 

The baristas are always friendly, the drinks come out fast and hot, and the food is really yummy too. I've had the Falafel burger which was hearty but not too heavy and which came with a nice side of crispy potato chips. I've also had a couple of their burritos which were also tasty but a little on the small side considering the price. But still, if you're looking to get some work done or if you want to do some fun people watching, this is a great spot!"}
{"text":"Took 20 mins to get a piece of pre-made quiche warmed up with only one other order ahead of mine. Food and coffee were decent, but the wait and unfriendly service made the experience less than stellar."}
{"text":"As someone who got through college on Intelligentsia, I had relatives who raved about Alterra's coffee, saying it was as good as Intelligentsia's.  That was high praise given the high quality of Intelligentsia.  I finally had some when I moved here a year ago and it lived up to their praise.  

Colectivo's coffee and Letterbox tea selections are wonderful.  The interior is inviting and a nice place to rest and get a drink.  

I understand why they shut off the wi-fi on the weekends.  Most people who have been to any coffee shop with wi-fi and no restrictions on how long you can stay have experienced tripping over cords, not being able to find a seat, and a shortage of outlets.  It's not an inviting experience for people who want to sit down and enjoy a drink and meal."}
{"text":"Eh, not sure what the fuss is about. Not great coffee, by Madison standards. Nice outdoor seating though, so there's that. There are a couple other cafes within a block or two that have excellent coffee, so no reason to go here unless for the seating."}
{"text":"Decent coffee. My vanilla latte didn't have enough vanilla for my latte, but my friends enjoyed their cups. 

Very unique ambiance! We sat in the upper level loft which was neat. 

Anyways it's a fun place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"We went to Milwaukee recently and tried Colectivo for the first time, we loved it so much we stopped in this Madison location on our drive home! Aside from the coffee being awesome, I just love this coffee shop. It's unique and cozy, with big windows looking out at the capital and plants everywhere. I really really wish there was a Colectivo location near me!!"}
{"text":"I love the design of this coffee shop. It's BEAUTIFUL. So open. Love the ambience, colors and feel of this shop.

I've been here on a Monday morning during the school year and it was very busy. But on a summer Sunday morning, it wasn't too crowded. 

They also have great food, which makes it even more ideal to stay here for a while and get work done. The baked oatmeal is delicious. Sandwiches are really nice. Coffee is good."}
{"text":"More than just great coffee... 

Yes, their coffee is delicious. It is served in an inviting atmosphere that is perfect for just about any group. There is counter when you need some alone time or feel like people watching all the way up to large tables for collaborating. Their outdoor spaces are even better with views of the capital, or my favorite - views of the farmers market on Saturdays. 

But let's talk about what has me coming back - the chorizo breakfast burrito with eggs, black beans, pepper jack, and spicey green chiles (side of salsa optional). The only down side - I want more. It is served with two small pieces of fruit always leaves me wanting more. Their other menu items are also good, but how do you beat all day breakfast?"}
{"text":"We came to collectivo for a coffee before driving back to Chicago on a Sunday after homecoming. It was packed. It was a little too overwhelming for us.... 

The food, however, was really great. We each got a soup of the day and a sandwich. We also got a mini carrot cake--- I would definitely recommend it. It was awesome. I got a vanilla latte and I hate to say it, but I like Starbucks more. Their berry smoothie was great, though. 

Overall, I would go back when it's not so packed and would probably like it more. The whole menu looked good for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"The only major critique I can offer is for more space. As a regular, I like the space a lot during every season, but it can crowd easily. Especially during the outdoor farmers market. I'm also not a fan of the smoothie texture, but they are still yummy. Coffee, tea, baked goods are all locally sourced as much as possible (WI) and baked in Milwaukee! Cheesy biscuit or cinnamon rolls are easily my favorites."}
{"text":"Wow. The State Street branch has some adjustments to make over its first year on the scene.

The feel of Colectivo is quintessentially \"State Street\" and \"Madison\". It belongs on State Street. It is hip(ster), fun, and rustic-ly modern. My other positive note is the coffee seems to be right on point for the brand. Tasty, well-brewed!

I have been extremely pleased and delighted with use of the space, notably the outdoor sunken patio, garage door-style open during warmer months (which reveal indoor, bench seating...VERY FUN to experience on a calm, warm, spring or summer evening), and upstairs seating spaces for some extra privacy.

Adjustments need to be addressed in its product. The food has not been consistent, often overdone/dry, and revealing disappointment in comparison to what I find at every other Colectivo location in Madison or Greater Milwaukee. Example: A tip I recently wrote, included a cheesy bacon biscuit order. The biscuit was unbelievably dry and over warmed/toasted to a deeper side of brown than was pleasing to the eye, and the bacon was also extremely dry. It tasted like a crumbly, tough corn dog. I nearly sent it back to the kitchen.

I love the feel of this Colectivo, but the small space is not appealing to me at peak trafficked times (morning, lunch, weekend meal times)."}
{"text":"I'm used to the Colectivos in Chicago, which are generally bad and unreceptive, but this one is the opposite. It sits in the center of Madison facing the capitol building and has a wide menu and many a rotating coffee option. I tried a Rwandan and Guatemalan which were both well dialed in and delicious. The ladies behind the counter were pleasant and helpful. I also tried the PB&J with oranges on the side and it was a solid snack to match the coffee."}
{"text":"I love the cortado and the Cortado Imperial Stout.  

The baked goods are always great and fresh.  They have an excellent variety of beans and teas."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Colectivo.  The beans are well roasted, which brings out the best in the coffee.  I have really taken a liking to cortados.  I have had some drinks I didn't like, but they are always quick to remake it.  As far as the lunchs and breakfast go.  I have tried just about everything on the menu.  My favorite is the chorizo burrito, or the bacon biscuit.  My lunch favorite is the turkey sandwich, with any of the soups.  They have my favorite cinnamon roll out of all cinnamon rolls I have ever tried."}
{"text":"Stopped here because we came down for the live jazz on King Street.

I sat at one of their outdoor tables, my Husband went in to order his drink. He was gone for about 15 minutes, I wasn't sure what was going on.

Two people came and told me they were officially closed, about 3 minutes apart. Both times, I informed them that was fine, I was just waiting for my Husband who had ordered his coffee. They weren't sympathetic, just looked at me and asked if I could go wait outside because they were stacking the chairs and tables.

I've worked customer service for 18 years, they should have said \"oh! Sure, no problem! You can wait here for him, we'll just stack the tables around you!\"

So, they were pretty rude, we've gone to the other location at the corner of State and Frances St's, and they've always been really friendly and nice there.

Also, they gave my Husband's drink away to someone else, which is why it took him so long in the first place. I guess, unlike every other coffee place ever, they don't write the names on the cups? I don't know.

Needless to say, we will only be going back to the State St location, _never_ to this one again."}
{"text":"Great location, great people-watching, great indoor-outdoor seating options, great food, great service, plenty of power outlets, tasteful music--but the WiFi situation needs to change! WiFi logs you out every hour and you need to log back in, reconnect to any servers, etc. Please, please, stop logging WiFi users off automatically after one hour. People camp out in coffee shops--they pay dearly for that privilege!"}
{"text":"I'm ready to accept my challenge to review Alterra after 3 visits.

First impression= WoW.  Love the how the windows open up to the square, food looked beautiful in the display case, lots of tables, good vibe and coffee was good.

Second impression= okay, I still like this place.  Bathrooms are okay given the no sink in bathroom idea.  Food is still delicious.  We tried the BLT, egg sandwich and a yogurt parfait.

Third impression= Coffee was excellent, ordered the falafel sandwich which was a B+.  

Lastly, it's a keeper.  Wish they had later hours.  (Tried to stop in after concerts on the square and it was already closed! ) Room for improvement but keep it coming Alterra!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Colectivo for for a while now but was discouraged due to the long lines on Saturdays. I thought this place must be really good if so many people are waiting in line, but alas this was not my experience with my first visit. I'll break my review down by categories. 

Location: Gotta give 5 stars for location. This is right across the street from the capital building in beautiful downtown Madison Wisconsin. It's right on the corner with great views. 

Service: The service was average so I will give 3 stars. Staff did there job but that's about it. 

Food: I was very disappointed so I'm only giving 1 star. The breakfast burrito was pre-made and the texture of the eggs were hard in sections, either from being microwaved too long or because it was frozen, maybe? I had to discretely spit out pieces of hard egg into my napkin because it was so impalpable. The texture of the potatoes were like mush. They should have been slightly al dente if they were doing it right. The potatoes were also dark in color suggesting they had been exposed to air too long after being peeled and diced. The burrito was also very small and not much bigger than a Chinese egg roll you would get at Panda Express! For $6.25 I expected more. 

Coffee: I can only give 2 stars because it wasn't much better than something you would expect from Denny's or McDonald's. It had a burnt taste, possibly from grinding beans in a hot grinder that scorched them? Dunno, maybe they use low quality beans. Coming to Madison from living in both SF and Seattle spoiled me, but I've had some great coffee in many other parts of the US. Colectivo should have done some basic research before starting a coffee shop but at least they do have legitimate espresso machines and a pour over setup. 

I really wanted to like this place but the only saving grace for not giving 1 star is the location."}
{"text":"Very good coffee!  Everyone is dedicated to make excellent quality coffee!  This is also where I buy of my own coffee beans.  They have excellent varieties and seasonal roasts that are locally sourced and tastes fantastic!

I love this location as well.  It's great to get into the city and the atmosphere is also wonderful.  They open up all the walls in warmer weather and you feel like you're pretty much outside!  It's great!  Also, plenty of outdoor seating as well right across the street from the capitol."}
{"text":"Heeey Yelp, have you guys heard about this new place yet? It's supposedly pretty good!

I'll break it down for y'all though. 

Reasons why this place rocks:
1) They have outdoor seating so I can enjoy the nice weather while enjoying my ice cold cup of coffee. 
2) They're right by the Capitol, so connecting to a wireless network is as easy as 1-2-3. I am actually doing work on my computer as I speak. And by work, I mean procrastinating in any way I can, in this case, writing this review.
3) They have more than just coffee!! They have an extensive list of smoothies, made however you want, with the freshest ingredients blended then and there. Oh and for those of you into a little midday drinking, they also have beer on tap. Can I get a WUUUT WUUUUT??!!
4) They have a clean, inviting decor with a wonderful staff that will make even the pickiest customers happy.
5) Best. people. watching. spot. in. town. for. sure. During my two visits here, I've seen a wedding photo take place, a prom picture take place, and a drunk person puking. How awesome is that?!

Reasons why this place doesn't rock:
....... I'll get back to you."}
{"text":"Coffee ok, forgot it can be strong. Bagel was rubber . Staff super polite and location great though."}
{"text":"You know, when this place first opened (and I was there like, a half hour after they flung the doors open on their first day...) I was a total Alterra evangelist. The coffee was good, the internet free and blazing fast, the staff friendly and upbeat; in short, much of what you'd like in a cafe that charges more than the average for their food and caffeine. 

But then the sheen started to wear off, and quick! I don't want to sandwich this review with the things I like, somethings needing improvement, and then ending with a pretty little bow saying something like, \"but I still love this place!\" Read down, and you'll find plenty of that. 

1) Their hours. What? Why, in a city like Madison, and in such a central location, does Alterra close at 9:00? Why is it so much to ask for a cafe to stay open until like, 11:00? I know Barriques closes at 11 on Thursdays-Saturdays, but for some of us, we're just hitting our stride at 7:45PM, leaving us with less than 2 hours of good stride time. C'mon folks, let's keep some big-kid hours. 

2) The music is really really terrible. I mean, atrociously terrible. It's like your high school's collective mix CD's were dumped into a CD player and thrown on shuffle, and even features the irregular volume levels inherent in all those purloined tracks! In addition to being a total crapshoot of what kind of aural assault you're going to get, it's loud as all get out. On numerous occasions, I've gone up to the counter to ask them, like your dad always did to you, to turn it down. It's gotten to the point where, upon my approach, an employee will say: \"Is it too loud? Should I turn it down?\" Yes. Yes it is too loud, and it takes over my noise-canceling headphones. And if you already know what I'm going to ask, that means you already know it's too loud. Just turn it down so conversations don't need to rise to scream-talking. 

3) Boy oh boy has the staff gotten surly. If you read my account of Johnson Public House, you'll know that I don't mind a bit of hipster-barista surliness with my coffee. It's par for the course... in *some* cafes. This is not the cafe. This is the bougie, over-priced, grown adult cafe. I'm paying more for my coffee than I would otherwise, and I expect the attitude to be dialed back. Granted, Alterra's management could be a right bear to work for, and may engender a surly staff, who knows? But if that's the case: ALTERRA MANAGEMENT: stop treating your employees poorly. They're unfriendly, and that makes me not want to come here. If it's just because they're bad at hiring people, and their staff thinks they're hot stuff 'cause they work at Alterra, then give me a break. 

4) On the employee tip, those bathrooms, single stall each, sure do get gnarly after a while. During the workaday week, there are typically lines out the door (I don't even want to know about what happens during the farmer's market... I avoid the square at all costs unless, you know, I'm at the market,) and that means that precious bathroom real estate (which often has lines rivaling the counter's,) gets trashed. Instead of standing around navel-gazing, it might be a good idea to check the bathrooms now and then. And maybe clean up after the circus has packed up and left? But instead, I see staff wandering about, seemingly aimlessly, all the while the bathrooms go untouched (making me not to want to touch them). And restock the creamer station while you're at it (and after changing gloves and scrubbing your paws, please.) I can't believe how many times I've gone over to get a straw or napkin and found the remains of what once was a supply bar. 

Anyway, there's my beef. I know we can't have everything all the time, but some things are easier had than others. And I think these are some low, low-hanging fruit."}
{"text":"Fantastic space flexible enough for quick meetings or study sessions. The music and chatter combine to create quite the cacophony at busy times so bring your Bose headphones if you plan to do any work. Their coffee has a uniquely strong and bitter aftertaste that might put off the average coffee drinker. I've found that dumping in enough of their whole milk and raw sugar creates my preferred McCafe latte flavor profile."}
{"text":"I love Colectivo and this location!! This is a great place to hangout as a college student meeting friends, working on some school work, or looking for a pastry and coffee. There is a definite hipster vibe which makes it more fun than a cookie cutter Starbucks. The staff here is always friendly and does a great job handling busy rushes."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim and was delighted. The branding IS FABULOUS, staff was very friendly. They have TONS of pastry to choose from, very dissapointing that NONE of it was vegan friendly. they did have some gluten free options. They carry soy/almond milk, so i was able to have some tea, and i had a pretty good granola bar that was homeade. I had a smoothie the following day and it was vegan and delicious. Definitely try the green hornet smoothie! My husband is a big fan of their coffee, bought some beans to bring home. they have really great tshirts for sale, sandwiches, coffee drinks, etc. the space itself is really lovely - right on the square with lots of outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Awesome!! I tried the pumpkin spice latte it was amazinggggg!  

The service was a little slow."}
{"text":"If you like hipsters and the inability to change your order, you'll like it here. I asked for a breakfast sandwich without cheese, the kid behind the counter responded with, \"We can't do that.\" When I asked what I could get without cheese, he said no modifications are allowed with the breakfast menu. It begs the question: Are the eggs pre-made? Because that's gross."}
{"text":"Colectivo is a pretty neat and new-ish coffee shop right on the north east corner of the Capitol square.

It's got a pretty rustic and hipster kind of feel. Cool music, great decor, plenty of seating inside and outside (as well as the \"porch\"? area).

Good variety of coffees and teas, and even some beer and food. Free wi-fi, but not on the weekends."}
{"text":"Been here many times and enjoyed it, but VERY upset I just drove downtown, paid to park in a garage, bought coffee and bought beans to take home (spent $16), and sat down to catch up on some work, only to find that they turn off wi-fi on Saturdays and Sundays!! Are you kidding me? It's not even busy in here (9:30 on a Sunday). 

I totally understand no wi-fi on a Farmers' Market Saturday, but this is ridiculous. Now I have to either go home and work or start this routine all over again and buy another coffee at another coffee shop and set up my laptop there. Collectivo has just lost a lot of future business from me. This is really disappointing."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite coffee shop in the downtown area. I hate to say that, because I like to keep my chain coffee use lowkey. But it's hard to not love the open atmosphere that Colectivo is so good at achieving. I'm not sure I've ever sat inside the actual building, because I'm always out in the patio section. Free wifi makes it great for getting work done, and the centralized location makes it perfect for people watching. The baristas are, for the most part, much friendlier than most other chain places, and there's plenty of room to find a table to yourself. I just moved to the Tenney-Lapham area, but I'll likely continue to make the trek down to Colectivo after work and on the weekends for my afternoon coffee fix."}
{"text":"The staff can get a bit flustered (depending on who you get) because it's always so busy, but the coffee is usually quality and the food is good too. I like their baked goods and their breakfast burrito is great, too! The only problem is finding a place to sit-- theirs an upstairs and usually when it's not too busy there is seating up there, but sometimes you just have to resort to waiting at the standing bar until a table opens up. It's really nice in the summer when they open up the patio, though, and that clears up the crowds a bit! The bathrooms can sometimes be a hit or a miss, though, depending on the crowd, but that's less the business' fault and more due to the millions of college students traipsing in and out. Definitely the place to go if you want a genuine coffee shop atmosphere! NOT the place to go if you want some peace and quiet with your coffee."}
{"text":"This is a good coffee shop with a great location. In the summer it is great to sit outside by the farmer's market and drink coffee and eat breakfast. They have a roast of coffee called black and  tan (a mix of two roasts really) that I particularly like to buy as whole beans to make coffee at home."}
{"text":"Love this place. Outdoor seating. Great selection of food and beverages. Prices are ok. Parking ramp a block away or on street. Staff friendly and helpful. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The coffee was good. The people who actually made it had a TON of customers to deal with, and they handled everybody in a quick and friendly way.

I just didn't understand why the girl who took my money kept looking over my shoulder. It kind of freaked me out. It was my left shoulder. There was nothing actually going on there, on that left shoulder, as far as I know. I don't wear shoulder pads or epaulettes, and don't have dandruff or angels. 

After a few \"Will that be cash?\" and staring over my shoulder type of transactions, I kind of really stealthily looked back there. Just see what was going on. 

I think she must have been looking at the sparrows. This place has awesome sparrows. House sparrows, also known as English. Male sparrows, female sparrows, a couple who I suspect are transgender, and a really lot of juveniles. They hop all over the place, consuming pastry crumbs, and generally looking very brown and cute."}
{"text":"Collectivo was a fun stop over after hiking at Devil's Lake. Good coffee pourover, GREAT espresso drinks, and AOK light food. I really liked the ambience, very chill."}
{"text":"Iced coffee with vanilla was alright! Super cute spot though and great location if you're at the farmers market. Staff was friendly too!"}
{"text":"Good place. Good coffee. Almost always easy to find a table. The staff is great - very friendly and attentive. And the coffee is pretty good."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I'm a basic b when it comes to my coffee (I go to that one huge coffee chain a lot). But, I haven't been there much since I found out about Colectivo. 

If you're a coffee drinker, and like to brew your coffee at home, I highly recommend getting some Colectivo grounds. Their classic Blue Heeler or the darker Velo are my favorites! Really good coffee for pretty cheap (~$13/bag!).

Don't stress, latte and espresso fans! Their in-house drinks are awesome too. They have a wide range of teas, iced coffees, and blended drinks! If you want to treat yourself, get an espresso shake - ice cream + espresso = deeloycious."}
{"text":"HIPSTER ALERT
Expensive coffee, Ipads, trendy indie music,  ever so carefully arranged hair and berets - 

Also, best coffee in Wisconsin, and pretty good baked goods.

Really, just super hard to beat this place.  Great coffee, free wifi, good food, great location."}
{"text":"Well, it serves a purpose- keeping all of those pesky students away from the other Colectivo locations. Not the most inviting atmosphere, which is fine, because you're going to find it hard to get a table. 

On a positive note, the coffee and food is up to Colectivo standards (which is to say better than average, but not life changing). Today I had a cappuccino and a ham and cheese croissant - both were good and I'd certainly order them again, to go. 

That said, this Colectivo location is busy and cramped and pretty loud. Lots of students on computers, many of which didn't have drinks. Not unexpected, of course, but certainly not the warmest atmosphere. It was difficult finding a table, and even when you do, it'll be shared and likely dirty. If you want to have a good Colectivo experience, I'd recommend either of their other Madison locations. If you're looking for a good cup of coffee to go, give it a try."}
{"text":"Coffee stout is excellent.  They have a welcoming staff and environment.  Can be a challenge to find a table despite the large space.  But I believe that is a commentary on how nice a spot it is.  Lunch sandwiches are good.  Coffee, too!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Colectivo ever since it opened in Madison. I definitely fell more in love with the space than anything else the first time I came here. I pretty much go for an iced coffee or iced chai, and if I want something non caffeinated I  go for one of their smoothies! I have to say I adooooore their hot chocolate too but I have a feeling that it is unabashedly full of cream and sugar and chocolate so I try to my keep my hot chocolate consumption to a minimum. I love hanging out here whenever I just want to chill and read some articles, sketch, or have some me time. It's also a great space to have quick impromptu meetings. They never play their music too loud and the patio is fantastically spacious when it's not too humid out. The indoor space with the French windows that open up is probably my favorite since you get the outdoor breeze without it being overwhelming. The service is prompt and polite but I'm not a huge fan of the food I've tried. It's mostly average to above average coffee shop food to me, but good enough when you need something to eat. 

Overall I have to say that Colectivo is a pretty regular stop for me and I don't see that changing much in the future."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my choice of black coffee here while my friends didn't. I just think they chose the wrong one. I got the one that was mixed with dark and light roast beans. I can't remember the name but it was delicious! No disgusting coffee aftertaste. All in all, I'd be back here and get the same coffee the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Always busy, but my favorite Saturday morning coffee spot!! I wish they had coconut milk, but I'm happy they at least have almond! The brownies are delightful too!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here after dinner for a warm beverage. It is located a couple of doors down from Graze.  The $4 medium masala chai hit the spot with its rich spices.

{"text":"Sometimes it can take a while for my drink to be ready. Friendliness here can be hit or miss. I come for the almond milk alternative since Starbucks doesn't carry it."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time--delicious food, quality coffee, and ample seating. But now, they don't have WiFi on weekends before 3 PM. I understand why, but there are better solutions. I no longer come here for that reason."}
{"text":"The place looked great the food was super good but staff seems like they didnt care but heys its a college town most college kids dont give a damn. Coffee smelled good i hope they well in the future. Of course im here in the morning and summer time it may be different in the evening"}
{"text":"Management wake up and smell the coffee. 

 Hipsters walking around talking and doing everything but providing good old fashioned customer service.  Arrived early on a Saturday morning fully staffed and not busy, the cashier had to repeat my order five time because he was to busy doing anything but listening to my order. The staff was busy talking to each other , I had to ask the barista to check on my order, she simple said they are working on it!     It took over 10 minutes to prepare a toasted bagel that was substandard tasted like it should have been sold at half price.   Very disappointed in the staff. 

Management you are wasting my time and dollar .   Turn down the hipster music, retrain staff on the importance of listening to a customers order an do things with a sense of urgency, after all the customer is the reason you are in business and with sub standard service like this you need to wake up and smell the coffee!!!

Disappointed at best."}
{"text":"Dear Colectivo, Will you marry me?  - Love Liz

Seriously, obsessed. This was my first time at a Colectivo in general. And I can not stop! 

Why not five stars? The staff sucked. It was my friend's first time and she was not used to ordering off their menu. In the age of Starbucks, sometimes people need a little help. Every place has their own vibe. Rather than being nice and friendly about it, they were kind of snarky. She ended up getting something she hated and their attitude annoyed me. I also have an allergy restriction and I asked them about it. They said it was designated on the menu...except that it was not. I do not need people to know, but just say you do not know. It is fine. 

Luckily my food and coffee were on point. They were so good it washed away their negativity. I ordered a double shot, skim milk vanilla latte. It was phenomenal. Warm, delicious and a little foam heart on the top. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros quiche, salsa on the side. The temperature was perfect, the quiche was fresh and the flavor was phenomenal. I am trying to find excuses to go back."}
{"text":"Collectivo on State offers a charming, but busy place to get coffee. I've tried their black coffee and espresso, both of which are pretty good; though their espresso is quite bitter, very different from Starbucks! Their baked goods, including coffee brownies and croissants are also pretty good. I haven't tried their hot sandwiches, but they did look pretty good. 

The building itself is new and modern, with loft seating and an outdoor patio when it's warm enough."}
{"text":"I think I've reviewed them before but my love has only grown since then.  The music is always on point, everything on the menu is always great, and everyone who works here is a damn saint so you better tip. Plus they have a cute yellow espresso machine and that's pretty cool. I've heard from friends with connections to he company that their baristas train for a really really long time before being able to serve to customers.  I don't know if that's still true but Im inclined to believe it after tasting the drinks from most of the baristas there.

Oh, and their rewards point card system actually accumulates really quickly and you can use the dollar amount earned at any time unlike most rewards systems."}
{"text":"This place is always busy, but the line goes quickly. Their mystic green tea is my go to. I usually would go for a chai, but I am not the biggest fan of collectivos. I always pair my green tea with their veggie pesto burrito. Loads of cheese, potatoes, pesto, brocolli and egg. Yummy! Service is not over the top friendly, but the usual for a loud, busy fast paced coffee shop."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is pretty cool.  Love the location, situated right on the corner of Capitol Square across from the Capitol building.  I can sit here for hours...plenty of seating inside and very colorful patio outside.  One of my faves in the Madison.  And of course - great coffee and service!
Ps: the sink is outside of the bathroom!"}
{"text":"This store has a unique coffeeshop vibe, good coffee, and decent food.

I'm a fan of this place, primarily because I like the look and feel. It's a two story venue with raw unfinished wood construction and vibrant primary colored decor. The tables are rather small, but reasonable given that this place attracts a lot of people from State St. The upstairs portion is better for a slightly quieter area to work and study. The coffee is tasty both from the store and via take home coffee beans. Keep in mind, it's cheaper to get the coffee in a mug than in a paper cup. The Espresso Shake won me over all 5 or so times that I've ordered it. The White Chocolate Mocha is alright, I prefer the Starbucks take on the drink. The 7 Layer Bar is more gimmicky than tasty, it's got chocolate chips, peanuts, and 5 other random nuggets. The sandwiches and wraps are good for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Having moved from Milwaukee, I was very sad to leave Alterra behind. I couldn't find a coffee shop that was anywhere near comparable to my favorite Milwaukee spot. I was super excited to find out that they were opening a spot in Madison - and only half a block from my office!

The location is perfect, tons of seating of various kinds.

The food (breakfast burritos, pastries, and the wisconsin grilled cheese being my favorite) is just as I remembered. The drinks - especially the smoothies (which you can get without yogurt to be made vegan), coffee drinks, and italian sodas are always a good choice.

The wifi is free, but spotty."}
{"text":"I like Colectivo a lot. Their coffee is decent and the people are friendly. There's a ton of indoor and outdoor seating, and their food is great. 

BUT! They now turn off wifi completely on Saturdays and Sundays. Wtf?! I understand Saturdays during Farmer's Market season, but Sunday? There's nobody here as I write this (tethered to my iPhone, using my precious at&t data), and it's 10 a.m. Come on, guys. 

I probably won't come here anymore on weekends, because I need teh interwebz for my work. Not cool."}
{"text":"?????????????13??????????????????
?????\"Butternut squash bisque\" ,size:cup, ??????????"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and enjoyed my experience both times. It's pretty big for a coffee shop, and there are lots of tables to work at. The atmosphere isn't as soothing as other places, but the furniture and layout are nice, so it's a great place to get work done. The coffee is good, but I've never tried the food."}
{"text":"A third update, and I'll keep it brief:

5 stars for service. 5 stars for typical coffee quality. The Sumatra, though? 1 star. Overroasted, disgusting garbage. So unbecoming of Alterra. Back to Bradbury's."}
{"text":"The location on the square is better. 
Good atmosphere, great decor, good for studying, people watching.
Solid A drinks, a little pricey. (10$ for medium mocha, Machiatto, macaroon, tip/tax) The food portions are small, food prices are very high, even for a corporate coffee shop chain. (6$ for a small slice of quiche, no sides) Pastries are more reasonable, but to sweet in my opinion.
Service is a B, maybe an off day?
They, like most coffee shops, do not have coconut oil, and when asked about it offer coconut flavor syrup or coconut milk, which shows the staff are not super knowledgeable about the newest trends, or that corporate has decided it is not profitable enough to offer."}
{"text":"Cappuccino is great. If you are not used to coffee, be careful. The coffee is strong and can shock you! I liked the place a lot and coffee too. Some cookies are fresh and nice too."}
{"text":"The good:  Good coffee, fair prices, nice digs - trendy hipster music not too loud.  Internet seemed speedy enough.

The bad:  The bathroom design.  Single handedly the most ill-conceived design I have ever seen.  Mens and Ladies potties are separate rooms each with an adequate toilet placement.  Dual co-ed sinks in a common area between the two open to the whole place.  Which means there's a lot of DNA on the inside door handles...and no way out without putting a little of yours there too..no thanks!"}
{"text":"I've been eagerly anticipating Alterra opening a location in Madison, given that they're said to be in the top ten coffeehouses in the country (by GQ and Forbes Traveler Magazine), but are still a Wisconsin company. I stopped in yesterday for a few hours, and was quite impressed with their new operation!

First, the place was crowded (especially for mid-afternoon on an overcast summer Wednesday). My companion and I were barely able to find a table, and it was in the open-air part of their dining room, not terribly close to an outlet. There are three different seating areas: an interior dining area, which was completely packed, the open-air indoor dining area (they open huge windows in this area, so one can get a lot of fresh air while being sheltered from the elements), and a large outdoor terrace seating area that looks out onto the Capitol Square. The tables do have nice signs (made of recycled cardboard) reminding customers to be courteous about dining spaces when the coffeehouse is more crowded, which I appreciated. There are plenty of chairs, which made it easier to accommodate groups of different sizes. The interior dining area, while bustling, is still beautiful, with a lot of recycled wood. There are several tables (including a large one with a \"community table\" vibe), and a bar along one side with lots of outlets and windows that let in a lot of natural light. There are high ceilings, which are beautiful, though there is little in the way of sound-dampening decor, so it can get noisy at times. The open-air indoor area is a bit quieter, though that could be because it seats maybe a third of the fully-indoor capacity. Their website notes that they use recycled building materials and participate 100% in WE Energies' \"Energy for Tomorrow\" program, which I really appreciate. They have plenty of recycling bins, which is great, and they even have pockets built into their busing bins for extra coffee, which is a smart idea. Since turnover at the tables is so fast, some of them aren't wiped down before you sit at them, although I'm sure if you alert a server, they'll clean it off for you. I just used a damp rag near one of the busing bins to wipe down my table; I appreciated the DIY option, since I'm a stereotypical self-sufficient Upper Midwesterner who hates asking people to do things for me. The servers are also great at whisking away empty used dishes so that you have more room at your table.

Second, the menu. It's huge! There are a lot of options, especially when you factor in the to-go cold case full of salads, wraps, and sides. I ordered a sport tea, an iced tea with caffeine and fruity citrus flavors. It was significantly better than the sport tea at Barriques. My companion ordered the sausage breakfast burrito and an iced mocha. Iced espresso drinks are a great way to judge a coffeehouse, since icing espresso has the potential to ruin the delicious crema and make it taste terribly bitter. The iced mocha was creamy and rich, without being overwhelmingly sweet or artificial-tasting. I highly recommend it, and I'm not even much of a mocha person. The sausage breakfast burrito was great, too. The meat was moist and flavorful, the eggs weren't overcooked, there wasn't a giant tortilla surplus at the ends (a pet peeve of mine), and it held together very well so that there was little mess. It came with a lovely smoky salsa, though it was a bit mild for my spice-loving palate. It also came with a side of perfectly-ripe orange slices, an excellent palate cleanser (though look out for seeds, they're still present). I will absolutely be returning this summer, although I shudder to think about how crowded they'll be once UW's fall semester starts."}
{"text":"Delicious chai (made right there. No mix!). Just peppery enough. Lovely ambience in shop then great place to walk around downtown. Was easy to find a place to park on the street (we were there on a Thursday early afternoon) in late July. Not sure if that is normal. Next time I'm in that part of the country I'll return!! I'd go out of my way to get there."}
{"text":"The Nitro cold brew is amazing but not available at all locations (boo! figure your shit out collective!). Also, I fucking love their coconut macaroons. Third best in town. Their troubadour bakery goods are all halfway decent but highly over rated in my opinion (definitely not the best brownie in milwaukee......) but the Macaroons are far undervalued and I super encourage you to try them!"}
{"text":"Alterra was where I first discovered \"craft\" coffee. They hold a dear place in my heart. For they made me want to work with it everyday.

The place has the same atmosphere as all the one in MKE. Same food and bakery. I never leave without get a couple of Cranberry Pumpkin Muffin. They have a comforting feeling with the spice and tartness from the cranberries.

Was excited when they started upping their game with the Brew Bar in MKE. Glad to se it here. Love the feeling that the coffee took time and got loving care just for me.

Awesome seating indoor and out. friendly staff. They got plastic cards to track coffee and beans for rewards. They no longer except there paper ones. They only thing that weirded me out was that there are no sinks in the one toilet restroom to wash your hands. Rather outside the door in the middle of the too. Felt like I was at the fair grounds or a festival. But that me.I know it applies to the health code. Never seen it before like that in a building setting.

Bit of Knowledge/Pet Peeve : never call a guy working in a coffee shop Baristo. Male or female we are called Barista."}
{"text":"Extremely unique resturant/cafe vibe, they're monthly/weekly specials are always great. definitely one of the best places to go for coffee in Madison"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop. I don't normally get anything special just their black coffees. Before Christmas they had one called wonderland and it was the best cup of coffee I've ever had. Right now I'm having their Blue Heeler coffee and it's pretty good. I love that their coffee isn't super acidic. But the real catch is their chocolate muffins. So why over pay for mediocre Starbucks go to Colectivo."}
{"text":"A cool place to stop by and hang out or grab and go. We went in during evening hours and it was bustling with people. A relaxing covered patio with a view of the Capitol building and plenty of seating/lounging room on the inside. My husband tried the Fyxation recommended by an employee and he enjoyed it. I tried the Espresso Shake and it was amazing. I believe it was blended with espresso beans and brewed espresso."}
{"text":"A great new addition to the state street area...(and by new I mean since I lived there 5 years). I loved the exposed finishedwood and ceiling rafters gave it a very rugged and hip feel. If I was going to school still I could've definitely seen myself spending many hours studying there... With plenty of tables and seats, it also seemed like a popular meeting spot for groups and teacher meetings. 

We got the southwest burrito and it was very good! Mike enjoyed his cortado and also finished my coffee."}
{"text":"Colectivo is a great addition to Madison's coffee scene (ok, I feel pretty nerdy referring to a coffee scene, but there it is) and the Capitol square in general. The large open space is bright and inviting, and they've done something that way more Madison establishments should do - big windows that open up to create an indoor/outdoor space. 

The crowds inside and out (weather permitting) attest to the popularity of this relative newcomer to Madison from Milwaukee, where they run several cafes, but it's pretty chill in the off hours. 

I am really happy with their coffee, which is served drip, pourover, and of course all manner of espresso drinks. Try a Cortado if you're in the mood for something a little different. 

If caffeine isn't your cup of tea, you've come to the right coffee shop - beers from Madison's One Barrel Brewing are on tap. I love this combination as it makes for a place where there's something for everyone, whether you prefer stimulants or depressants. And no one will judge if you order both. 

Colectivo also has cool, well-designed T shirts and many styles of coffee mugs, and a very good assortment of equipage to brew at home, from drip coffee makers to burr grinders to pourover gear."}
{"text":"Well - would have been 4 or maybe 5 stars. The food is excellent here. The coffee too. The vibe is Hipster meets South American Worker's Cooperative. Cool artwork, including on the coffee bags themselves. 

Have to go with 3 stars though for one reason - no WIFI on weekends. I understand no restaurant wants a customer to order a single coffee and sit there for half a day surfing videos. But I would have easily spent $20+ there in a couple hours time. Maybe they could devise a program where wireless is good for 2 hours, then a charge after that.

Great service from employees otherwise. They definitely know their stuff."}
{"text":"IM FURIOUS 

no wifi on weekends?!?!?
I get it, no squatters or whatever, but WHAT THE HECK

still love the coffee and food."}
{"text":"Colectivo Coffee is a Wisconsin-based chain of coffee houses. They roast their own coffee, and I was reminded of Caribou Coffee, a Minnesota chain that went national and later was incorporated by Peet's Coffee and Tea. 

My first visit to Colectivo left me impressed. I had a matcha green tea latte that harmonized matcha and whole milk. With a shot of espresso, this MTL could become superior to Sawada's military latte that has taken Chicago by storm. I could see the MT drink menu expanded to include a flat green as well. 

Overall, this location offers a plethora of branded merchandise, baked goods and hot breakfast items available all day."}
{"text":"The Colectivo location on State reminds me of a lot of coffee chain locations in college towns (Espresso Royale, Starbucks). Nonchalant baristas and college kids abound. It's a place people study and a table will be occupied for hours at a time. The vibe is different from the Capitol location, but much of the merchandise and food are the same. I feel like there is greater emphasis on drink craftsmanship at the Capitol location, but if you're in need of a caffeine fix, this location suffices."}
{"text":"Lately, I've really enjoyed coming here. It has a hipster vibe as noted from other Yelpers. My favorite place to sit is the 2nd floor at the bar style seating overlooking the first floor and outside. Their iced coffee is pretty good but their sizes run kind of small in my opinion. Their medium size looks like a small but maybe its just me being Americanized lol. I haven't had their food as it is kind of expensive ($6-7 for a breakfast sandwich) and nothing looked that enticing to me anyway. The employees are always super nice. I can always count on good costumer service from them."}
{"text":"Great coffee...had espresso and cafe au lait here. This spot also has excellent ambiance and a lovely outdoor seating area across from the capital."}
{"text":"As it turns out, if you sit in the back, it's not all that loud! It's kinda perfect- not a lot of people walking by, pretty quiet, leather couches & leather upholstered chairs. But there aren't always seats left. I usually swing my Colectivo to check for seats in the back, if there aren't any, it's off to Barriques. 

Revised conclusion: Great coffee, decent study spot."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to Colectivo and only wish I'd discovered it sooner! I'm just visiting Madison and of course came here on my last day. I would come here and hang out every day if I could. The service was amazing - baristas are beyond helpful and so nice.

Also a great cup of coffee and some good looking food (though I never actually tried any of it) :)"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and still I cant figure out why its so popular...
The pastries are slightly better than a Twinkie and their version of cappuccino is a burned milk latte with some foam on top (like Starbucks)
It's also overcrowded most of the time, so your drink may take between 5 to 15 minutes..."}
{"text":"Collectivo is a cool coffee shop with a very hipster vibe. It has large glass windows and during the summertime they open the windows to allow the nice breeze in. It's a good place to meet with friends or study (except the wifi times out about every 30 minutes).

The coffee isn't the greatest or the food but I think people go for the ambiance."}
{"text":"I was in Madison on business and as an early riser was looking for a good cup of coffee. Colectivo opens at 6 AM which was very convenient.  They made my favorite latte to order and it was delicious.  Great spot and a better choice than that Seattle based company!"}
{"text":"This place is really cute. Love the options of seating from tables, booths and chairs. We got lattees and a carrot cake. The carrot cake was perfect and loved the frosting and love that if you don't take out they put the coffees in cute white saucer cups. Everyone is super friendly there too."}
{"text":"Hipster coffee cool. 

Sesame cashew tofu wrap is a vegan delight. Wish they had some vegan baked goods, though. 

TONS of seating, indoors & out. lots of outlets for the laptop crowd :) 

Love their merch- cool graphics!"}
{"text":"Great place for a morning coffee and food to get your day started.  I had the oatmeal- delicious! Coffee- delicious!"}
{"text":"The more I visit colectivo, the more I love it. I had never heard of this coffee change before moving to Milwaukee. 

Their almond chai latte is to die for. It has the perfect mix of sweetness and spiciness. I recently tried some of their soup dishes an was presently surprised as well.  I had the pleasure of having one of their breakfast burritos. It had baked potatoes, eggs, and bacon. It was well made, not greasy. It was noticeable that they took time making this dish and wanted it to be flavorful but healthy. 

I am not a fan of coffee but I tried their turkey roast brew at one point and I have to say, colectivo is trying to make this tea girl into a coffee chick. 

This is the perfect place for study groups, late night solo study or work sessions. It is the quintessential study/hang/ lets get a cup of coffee on our first date spot. 

Will definitely be exploring colectivos around Wisconsin over the next few years."}
{"text":"Yes, I love the outdoor seating and the location can't be beat.  Solid food and coffee offerings.  Why just the 3*?  The wait times can be ridiculous at times and this is not just the function of alot of people wanting to try it out. Absolutely no reason why I need to wait 5 minutes at the \"brew bar\" for an iced coffee.  Glass of ice+pitcher of cold brewed coffee=iced coffee.  The same can be said about some espresso drinks as well that I have ordered.  Yes, it is popular as a shiny penny now but they need to get their act together."}
{"text":"Damn you Colectivo for all your aesthetically pleasing cafes!  Seriously, your entire wall opens up to the courtyard next to State Street making it one of the coolest spaces I've seen.  You make it very hard not to stop in.  If only you could deliver better coffee/espresso drinks that truly matches your epic space.  Unfortunately, the drinks fall short (don't get me wrong, not horrible but not great either) and your staff is, at times, very indifferent.
Nevertheless, you are convenient, you are close, and I will be back."}
{"text":"It's a hipster-looking joint that has an open airy setting. It's the perfect place for people to come study or meet up for coffee. I had a refresher there and the tea was alright. It is pricey and coming from Seattle, I've seen a lot of coffee shops like this one so it unfortunately wasn't that special. Worth checking out though if you're around the area."}
{"text":"Loooove iiiiit. I'm a chai kinda girl, so I can't really speak to their coffee. But I bounce around between coffee shops around the square, and Alterra/Colectivo is one of my favorites. My favorites are the open-air patio and the Union-style color scheme and chairs. Oh and their t-shirts!

The one thing (besides price; Colectivo's a bit more expensive) that sometimes makes the choice between Colectivo and Starbucks difficult, for me, is that Colectivo's chocolate croissant just doesn't quite measure up to Starbucks'. But sometimes I just want some good chai in a fancy-lookin' cup, so don't worry Colectivo, I still love you."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here for lunch over the weekend.   The Pesto Mozzarella sandwich and Veggie burrito were both excellent!"}
{"text":"Order up a whopping portion of view--YESS! Then a cup of good coffee--YESS! And then, sorry to report, an overwhelming portion of slack jawed youth who simply don't want to be there. Forget being welcomed as in every coffee shop in the land. The diffident order taker could hardly be bothered to take the order. Then failed to bring drinks that got both cold and warm sitting on the counter--though the rest of the order was delivered. Wanted to be elsewhere--staff. Joining in on that--our group. Any owner coming in as a disguised customer would be in despair because, great location and coffee, zero customer care."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a coffee shop on the square, Colectivo is your best option. I'd say their biggest strength is actually the quality and variety of their coffee and espresso, which is surprising as you might think a place like this would simply thrive by being so close to the capital. They have a new espresso type week, which they mostly source from Central or South America. They also serve a variety of food items that are small enough to be quick but large enough to be satisfying. I often choose colectivo for a quicker brunch on the weekends over other sit-down restaurants in the area.

Wifi is free but starts late-morning / early-afternoon on the weekends."}
{"text":"Got my drink order wrong, and not for the better. Thanks for giving me a medium at large price. Also, staff seems more interested in conversing with each other and their friends than working. Telling me I have to put cream into the coffee is not a mortal sin, but the coffee tasting like Bigfoot's dick is."}
{"text":"I was famished and needed a gluten free meal, and had my dog in tow. We were able to sit outside and eat a delicious \"sandwich\" (lettuce wrap instead of bread).  Very pleasant meal."}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafes are around! I make a trip once in a while downtown for nothing more than to stop here for lunch and a mocha. The mochas are delicious (not too sweet) and the food is great! The atmosphere is trendy and perfect for downtown and this is a great place to stop after a trip around the farmers market."}
{"text":"i love the setting here. it's great for chatting with a friend, getting some work done, reading a book, just dropping in to get coffee, whatever. and the coffee was good too! im a fan. and they've got a nice selection of merch for fans of hipster tees, mugs, and travel cups."}
{"text":"Been here twice on visits to Madison and it's the most Seattle-like coffee place! Love the baked goods as well. Nice service and plenty of seating options. Seems like a popular place with the locals - always a good sign!"}
{"text":"I love the set up of Colectivo - it's basically three coffee shops in one. Out front there is both patio seating and an enclosed area that's essentially a covered porch. The main area is bright and cheery and buzzing with the kitchen and bar, and in the back things get cozy with dimmer lighting, couches, and high-backed chairs.

Colectivo runs a pretty legit food game, so it's easy to plunk down for the day if you've got a lot of work to do. I recently allowed myself to pretend that the peanut butter banana muffin was a healthy breakfast choice (I mean, it's basically a fruit, right?) and enjoyed it with their Revv tea (insanely hot - take the cover off and let it breathe for a bit if you can). 

Aside from the minor annoyance of having to log back into the internet every hour, my morning at Colectivo was an excellent experience. I'll definitely be making it a regular spot for plowing through emails."}
{"text":"I was here about once a week over the summer for a meeting and I've got no major complaints. The outdoor seating is comfortable and surprisingly quiet for being right off of State Street. The mornings provide a good amount of shade from surrounding buildings. 

The indoors is lovely, has plenty of seating, and features walls that roll up to let in the nice weather and a standing bar that gives people a place to wait for their to-go orders without being in the way. There is an upstairs, but I've yet to check it out as I always forget it exists until I've gotten myself settled in. Bathrooms are single-use and generally in good shape. 

Staff has always been kind and efficient. Drinks have always been prepared well. \"Milwaukee's Best Brownie\" isn't very good, but I haven't tried their other food offerings. I'm guessing they're on par with the other Colectivos in town, aka tasty. 

Two things I'm not a fan of:
1) The music is very, very loud. There are quite a few people who hunker down to work or study and when I am trying to listen to a weekly conference call I have to hold my hands over my ears to hear. I imagine my compatriots are in a similar boat, though maybe I'm just old/need my hearing checked. If I can stay outside it's fine, but on days when it's raining or the shade has given way to sun and my pasty skin starts burning and I have to move inside it's frustrating. 
2) Colectivo's practice of kicking me off the internet every hour. Maybe they want more turnover? It's not hard to back up the browser to reload the portal, but sometimes the page won't load and I've got to restart my computer to make it pop back up. Not ideal, especially if I'm in the middle of a project.

Overall, though, I can look past those annoyances for a pleasant setting and prime location."}
{"text":"The best coffee hands down in a great university atmosphere, a stone's throw from the UW Madison.... Good bites too, perfect on a chilly spring day! Love the atmosphere, great baristas!"}
{"text":"Decent place to grab a coffee and a bite on the Capitol Square. The place could have used some attention to detail in terms of getting tables wiped down, as well as the state of the condiments counter. 

I had a avocado BLT deal... It was decent... tomatoes were shot. Also had the white bean chili - could have used some kick but was decent. Topped it all of with a cowboy cookie... I'd order this again. Maybe just coffee and two cookies."}
{"text":"Let's face it, sometimes when you're in college a study session at a coffee shop is the complete opposite. It's a time to indulge in your favorite drink and try out the the pastries baked daily. 

Colectivo coffee has a crowd mixed between those cramming for exams and those who socialize more than study. The best part is it usually doesn't bother anyone regardless. They have seating right by the door, in the back and some upstairs (a patio too when the weather is nice). One bonus is there are outlets upstairs in back of the wall seating so there's a place to charge your computer/phone. 

The staff is really friendly and know what they're doing. I've had their espresso shots a few times and enjoyed it. They offer a variety of food from pastries to sandwiches so you can study all day! I decided to try the espresso covered chocolate pastry. It was amazing. Very rich but also baked to the right size so it wasn't too much to eat. This place is usually very busy so finding a spot can be hard."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite and was very happy we did. This place has a great menu with something for everyone and plenty of seating. Our food was delicious and the coffee was amazing too."}
{"text":"Great coffee at a reasonable price, and an even better ambiance. Do you want to sit outside right on the square in beautiful Terrace-colored chairs? check. Do you want to sit inside in a spacious, high-ceiling, svette space with plenty of study room? check. Not sure? My favorite spot is the in-in between covered area with large open windows. 

Dog friendly (outside and in-between areas). Good smoothies. Only knock is that wifi isnt available until 2PM on the weekend, even if you're a paying customer."}
{"text":"This place is hands down my favorite coffee shop In Madison. Right on the square so easily accessible and deceivingly large on the inside so I've never had trouble finding a spot, especially if you don't mind sitting right next to random people. I've gone to do work here during the week and on weekends and it's the perfect amount of busy without being distracting. Not too quiet that you could hear a pin drop but not too loud that you can't get work done. Also it has windows flanking most of the coffee shop making it bright and inviting all the time. 

I've had both coffee and tea there and never cease to be disappointed, I'm also in love with coffee shops that make designs in your coffee and these baristas have that down. I've had numerous items on the menu, as well, and I have yet to go wrong. I fell in love with the white bean chili that has a little kick to it and is the perfect soup for a cold Madison day.

My only con to this place is the wifi, it's not always that great and only available after 2 on the weekends, which makes doing work a little difficult if you need wifi. Other than that, no complaints!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with Colectivo when it was still Alterra. Their drinks and baked goods are to die for, and I'm confident to say that out of all the other coffee shops downtown/on State St, Colectivo makes the best-tasting coffee for the price. It's a little on the expensive side, but I don't mind paying that much for good coffee. There's plenty of seating space (indoor and right outside) and I love how they open the facade windows during the summer. 

All that being said, there's two things that Colective can work on. First is the lack of internet on Saturday-Sundays. I didn't know shutting off online access was even a thing for coffee shops, especially one in a college town. I understand that bandwith is expensive, it's just annoying because I love how removed it is from campus. I like being able to do schoolwork ithout stupid sorority girls babling all day (looking at you Starbucks), but I need internet. Lastly is the lack of outlets, which is a problem in all coffee shops I think.

All in all, I still love Colectivo but I'm probably not going there during the weekends, unless I just wanna chill and drink coffee."}
{"text":"I always come here to do my work and sometimes it is packed, but people are usually nice and I can find a spot. They make a really good mocha (especially Aiki) , which I am picky about.

This was one of my favorite establishments in MKE and it is nice to have it in my hometown.

The music is always friendly so if I forget my headphones it isn't awful.

I will say that a lot of suits come here, which can kind of take away from the super local down to earth vibe, but it is also nice that all types of people congregate here.

I will say that sometimes the tables are a lil sticky, but they are busy all the time."}
{"text":"Prefer Colectivo to Starbucks any day... just discovered it while traveling around Wisconsin.  Really nice Masala Chai tea.. good kick to it.  This one is located at the steps of UWM so full of kids studying at all hours but I found it a nice break on an early Saturday morning, and a much better option than the coffee house in our hotel across the street. (Graduate)
They seem to have a kitchen back there so baked oatmeal here is a much better option than Starbucks... website says pastries are made in Milwaukee , which I assume is their home, but I found pastries at this branch just as good as in Milwaukee yesterday."}
{"text":"A recent visit to the Colectivo in the Tenney Building yielded a new revelation, but something was different-what has changed?  Coffee?  Nope, it's still reigning supreme over many of the other local and regional options (even if the price has elevated slightly due to global pressures).  They DID finally get rid of the couch in the back that was probably home to all manor of microscopic life, thanks to all the people who used it.  The staff is still mostly young and slightly cheerful, but not cloyingly so.  Well, it was too late in the day for coffee, so I checked the food specials board.  The temperature outside resembled a cryogenic experiment, so what better antidote than a meatloaf sandwich?  Visions of an inch high braised meatloaf sandwich, perhaps with a nice mound of onions began to make my mouth water.  What was served destroyed that dreamy image in one unceremonious moment.  While the tennis ball-sized circular toasted sesame seed bun was a viable option if the meat overran the bun's perimeter, it would not have been my first choice.  Upon looking \"under the hood\", I was greeted with a meager portion of meat that would have left a tween girl's stomach growling, post consumption.  The \"side\" was a medium mound of potato chips.  All this \"pomp and grandeur\" for....$7.95????! I double checked the calendar on my phone.  No, it was not April 1st, but the joke was definitely on me.   Perhaps it's time for the \"brass\" in the boardroom to be told that if they take the same path as Food Fight with regard to cutting corners, they will find their current food concept is even less sustainable than an average fast food burger.  Maybe they could try posting pictures of what items on the menu look like, so I don't have to ask as many questions.  Who am I kidding, the people in the boardroom have their late model Teslas and timeshares somewhere overseas, so honoring the request of an amateur food critic isn't even on their radar."}
{"text":"I love all the Colectivo Coffee shops, but the one on the square is my favorite. I mean, where else can you relax with a book overlooking the square (the covered patio is delightful) while enjoying a delicious iced coffee and see a man in a gorilla suit drive by on his motorcycle?

Service is always good (sometimes you'll even get a friendly note written on the napkin that is tucked into the basket with your breakfast burrito), food is delicious and simple (see: breakfast burrito), and coffee is strong but not bitter. Plus, their bakery game is getting pretty strong. I'm thinking about picking up a loaf of ciabatta right now."}
{"text":"Easily, a Madison favorite on the Square (great outdoor patio).  I'm sure you already know about the coffee.. it's excellent.

Their baked oatmeal is terrific.  I suggest ordering with yogurt instead of the milk.  If you're looking for a dessert or treat, you can't go wrong with one of the brownies.

A minus star for turning off their WiFi on the weekends. I understand the reasoning (squatters).. but it's still a drag for those of us who want to do a little surfing while we enjoy our morning coffee.  There are better solutions."}
{"text":"May I preface my 3-star review with the following confession?  The coffee here is good. Pretty darn good. 4 or 5 star good. I also love coffee though. Like, a lot. 

The location is convenient and the space is attractive and hip the way coffee houses should be. And I do feel true, honest pity for them when I see them getting inundated by Farmer's Market or other crowds. Truly. Kudos to your workers for surviving the chaos. 

But...

1. Products: I have never had more than a luke-warm experience with anything other than their actual coffee offerings.  Their food is just ok, and is rather expensive considering what you get. 

2. Crowd.  Long lines, and even in their huge space it is often crowded and loud, and something about the kind of crowd I often find there makes me wrinkle my nose in distaste. Perhaps it is the entire chapters-worth of Sorority girls constantly in attendance. Or maybe it's the clans with 6 children running through the isles. I know it is their location that brings this mess upon them, and it isn't their fault. But I don't find myself wanting to stick around and hang out. Oh and with 50 people all using their internet, it is slow and patchy and kicks you off frequently. So I never linger. 

3. Staff.  I get it, its a coffee house and you are a barrista, and that makes you cool in my book. You can even be a little pretentious and get away with it and I won't think twice on it. Thats the coffee house code. 
But seriously, these guys practically sneer at me every time I order. I swear, I am super nice to everyone. I'm service industry, I always tip, I'm always polite and full of thank yous. So I am not sure what I am doing to earn their disdain.

 Moreover, they try to TALK ME OUT OF ORDERING WHAT I WANT. This has happened several times. But it's not just that, but that they act like I don't know what I am ordering every time, and try to convince me that what I really want is a cappuccino or a latte or the usual press-pot coffee.  I order that, when I WANT that.

 For example:  \"I'd like a machiatto to go, please.\"  Sneer.  \"Do you even know what a macchiatto IS?  Its not like at S-bucks, its only going to fill like, this much of your to go cup. You want a latte, right?\"  No... I asked for a macchiato because I know what that is and what I would like, so please give it to me. I could pass this off as them trying to be helpful, in the face of I assume hundreds of sorority chicks that expect some kind of large blended caramel concoction when they order a macchiato. But it has happened repeatedly and it annoys me. 
Or \"Can I get a cup of that hand-crafted poured coffee?\"  Sneer. \"Look, that coffee is something we have to pour slowly over the grounds, its going to be a while. It's also more money. You sure you don't want a regular coffee, like this one right here?\"  No... I asked for that coffee because I want to try your expensive, premier fancy coffee and I am prepared to both pay for it and wait for it, thats why I ordered it. 

Anyway, I do want to like them because they make pretty good coffee. But I think I will just keep going to Michaelangelo's, where people smile when they see me and I never have to wait 20minutes just to order something that they will insist isn't really what I wanted.   And if I want a big ol' blended caramel frou-frou dessert coffee, then I will go to S-bucks."}
{"text":"The 'pour overs' of any if their coffees, even on the daily coffee list, cost extra, even though it doesn't say so anywhere in the price list. Starbucks, a block away, does not charge you for this inconvenience."}
{"text":"The tension hangs thick in the air, like a wet fog. They know as soon as I walk in the door. They can smell it. I am a Starbucks guy. An enemy soldier boldly strolling (meekly shuffling) into enemy territory. Like an old west saloon, the hubbub of the day falls to a sudden halt. Bespectacled hipsters stop padding away on their laptops, urbanites of undermined origins stop gently bobbing along to the latest grooves pulsing through their earbuds. It all stops, and you can practically hear a needle scratch off a record.

\"Look, guys, a Staaaaaaarbucks guy is here,\" a flannel-clad beardo falsettos into the pregnant silence. The entirety of the shop roll their eyes in unison. Rolled eyes are the snapped fingers to this particular West Side Story. The judgment settles heavily on me as I approach the barista. She narrows her eyes and, through gritted teeth, manages \"what can I get started for you?\"

The menu is impressive. The coffee concoctions are simpler than, ahem, other establishments but still offer plenty of room for customization. A full, lunch-centric food menu is available and there are plenty of fresh baked goods. This is how the other half lives. Could... could all the propaganda foghorned at my dumb face by the green logo'd woman be... be false? No! I must not give in! I am here for reconnaissance! Nothing more!

I request a large white chocolate mocha. \"Okay,\" says the barista. What am I supposed to read from that? Well, get ready for this next bombshell, folks. \"Can I get your name?\" she asks as though I'm not on a secret mission. I am prepared, though. My coffee war espionage training kicks in just in the nick of time.

\"BEN ROETHLISBERGER, QUARTERBACK OF THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS,\" I answer. She holds my eye for a moment. Is she on to me? The seconds feel like hours.

\"Okay...?\" She scribbles Ben on the cup. Whew. Almost blew my cover.

Despite the traffic in the shop, the staff move quickly and keep everything in order. Sooner than is reasonable, my name (\"name,\" you guys. Shhhh) is called and my white chocolate mocha is ready. And... and it's beautiful. The barista has made a little heart shape with the espresso in the frothed milk. No one is staring at me like an outsider. They never were. They're living their lives like I'm living mine. Just enjoying some coffee. 

They aren't the enemy and we're more alike than I'll ever know. I like flannel! I like eyerolls! I like this white chocolate mocha! I like the sweetness on the frothed milk! I like that the price is pretty solid! I like Colectivo! I said it and now I'm free! I LIKE COLECTIVO! I, \"BEN ROETHLISBERGER,\" LIKE THIS REALLY PRETTY GREAT COFFEE PLACE CALLED COLECTIVO!

Give peace a chance, dude. The only casualty in this war is mediocrity in coffee choice."}
{"text":"Great shop in Madison. What strikes me is how affordable everything is! You can get a v60 for less than $3? A pound of beans for $13? Take my money, Colectivo. Enjoying their Ethiopian Yirg at home. 

As a visitor to Madison and a coffee nerd, I loved having Colectivo so close to my hotel. The space is large and inviting with friendly service. Love their open seating outside, and the coffee I had also tasted great. Will return whenever I'm back in the city."}
{"text":"Great coffee place. Well experienced baristas. Perfect coffe blend. Don't mix soy with the coffee though. Reasonable price and there are 4 sizes of drinks. If your in the mood., sit there for the entire day with free wifi., I dont know how they manage that though."}
{"text":"I like a good cup of coffee and a good espresso, both of which can be found at Alterra. They have a multitude of different roasts and their menu is easy to navigate. I found myself at this Alterra at 9:45 AM on a Friday morning. Common sense would tell me that most people should be at work around this time during the work week. I guess I was wrong? This place was PACKED to the gills with people. I had to wait quite a while for my coffee. Not the biggest fan of that. I get that Alterra is bright and shiny and new, but for 9:45 on a Friday morning, one should not have to wait 15 min for their coffee. Nu-uh. No. 

I didn't eat anything here today, but the bakery case was calling my name. It took great reserve not to order a scone or a cookie or a cinnamon roll. I've had their food at their Alterra at the Lake location in Milwaukee, so I assume it would be similar. Next time I go I will eat. 

The decor at this place sort of puzzled me; you enter and go through a seating area, then you stumble upon the area you place your order and pick up subsequent order, and then there is a third room even further back. I didn't like the lay out. 

Overall, good coffee. Welcoming vibe. Friendly staff. Cut the line and I will never have a need to go to the Starbucks down on the square ever again."}
{"text":"Cool coffee shop and I dig how big the space is. You have your choice of semi-outside tables (Which smell reminiscent of cat food, but in not a bad way), cushion-y leather chairs, and the standard tables with chairs of various sides. My chai was good, if not a bit too sweet. The food looks good too. I would heartily support this chain of coffee shops opening up some CA locations."}
{"text":"Everything about this place deserves five stars.
The food is always delicious, there's a wide variety of drinks, and the ambiance is so cute.
The menu can be very overwhelming, but the staff is always super helpful!!
I LOVE the tomato basil turkey sandwich!! I tried the turkey club once to switch it up, and it was good, but not as good as the tomato basil.
They have a smoothie special that changes frequently but the tropical smoothies and the pink panther are the best! 
Overall, it's always a great experience!"}
{"text":"I only drink coffee when I absolutely need to and I think it all tastes more or less the same. This review is for the other stuff, but apparently if you're into coffee (I'll never understand) you'll like Colectivo.

The smoothies are delicious and super creative! Ginger with tangy fruit? Genius! I've also loved their scones and breakfast sandwiches. The only thing I've eaten that I didn't like was the granola. It was pretty expensive and just didn't taste that great in my opinion. Apparently the BAKED granola is wonderful.

Sitting outside in the summer and observing the Farmer's Market is an ideal Saturday morning activity. WHY DOES WINTER EXIST? Ugh"}
{"text":"Quick, friendly, tasty! I was on a morning run around 7:15 and ran by an already busy Colectivo. When I returned at 9:15, plenty of the patio seats were taken and the interior was not full but busy. That's always a good sign for a new restaurant. The place has order boards for all day breakfast, sandwiches, coffees, and smoothies. I suggest you decide quickly because the line for your order moves pretty quickly and it's hard to read the boards at the register. I couldn't decide between the veggie sandwich or something else. I wanted something more filling, so I ordered the bacon, egg, and potato burrito. Immediately after ordering I had that depressed feeling about doing too dang much, but the burrito arrived and was perfectly portioned. So often places serve huge dishes that are impossible to finish, but this was not your chipotle sized burrito. It was feeling without being overwhelming and was more heavy on the potato and light on the bacon. It also was garnished with orange slices, and I appreciated the extra vitamin C. I had a regular latte with my food which was really great. For $10 bucks I'm quite impressed and I'm sad I can't try the place for lunch."}
{"text":"Good coffee, good atmosphere. They even have uniquely fun cups to vessel your coffee to your mouth. Overall pretty dandy. The only issue I could list is that it isn't open late enough. It's downtown on the square where there are people out pretty late and studying or whatnot. 

Now I'm not saying it should be open 24-hours, however if it was open until 1AM or so that would be nice."}
{"text":"I could see myself frequenting this local coffee shop if I lived in Madison. I like how the garage door windows were opened on the morning I visited to let in the fresh cool air (I could never imagine this nice of weather in Austin during the summer). One thing I wish they did was offer a free drink with a purchase of a bag of beans like other local coffee shops. They did mention they had a rewards system to make up for that (10 purchases for a free drink I think). Good to know for Madison residents. 

The drink I ordered was solid (cold brew) and was happy to see that they would start serving nitro cold brews later this year. All in all, service was great and I could see myself returning."}
{"text":"What's going on at this location?

The coffee is awful! Starbucks does better and that's saying something. The coffee in the afternoon has an after taste of tea which leads me to believe they don't clean the machines properly, and that grosses me out. 

Some of the staff is rude and treats you like crap. Try the capital location for a better product and slightly better atmosphere or Starbucks."}
{"text":"I ordered an egg sandwich and an iced black coffee. They gave me a # to take to my table, but from past experience I know their drinks don't come out with the food; you have to wait for that at the bar separately. No big deal. I waited for maybe 5 mins and then my food came out. I continued to stand waiting for my coffee for about 5-10 more minutes, holding onto my sandwich which was getting cold. Finally, with much apology, my iced coffee finally arrived. The guy who served it to me was nice about it, but that doesn't change the fact that I paid over $10 and waited about 15 min for a barely warm egg sandwich and a simple iced coffee. I hate to favor Starbucks over a local business, but I would have had them both in about 3 mins there for at least a few bucks less."}
{"text":"This is a fun coffee shop on State Street. We ventured in during our Caffeine Crawl event. They had three of their coffees available to sample. They were really knowledgeable about their coffees (where it's grown, how it's roasted and the variety of brewing techniques). Love their fun sugar skull motif. They have lots of seating for those that are stopping in to get some work done or those that need a place for a quick bite. This place is reflective of the campus community that surrounds it. It was nice outside, so they had the garage doors wide open and the breeze was nice. I didn't get any food and didn't see any plates nearby. Word on the street is that the food is good though."}
{"text":"Selections were plentiful, breakfast all day, bakery, soups, sammies, coffee of course. 
The staff was stone faced.  Not a smile, smirk, nothing. 
White bean chili was bland and pretty flavorless. Looks pretty but ...nothing; just a leftover garlic aura on your tongue if you can imagine. The temperature was barely warm. This just made it pastier.  
My cherry cheese croissant was enticing through the glass case but upon tearing into it, stale and tough. 
I'm going to stick with Michelangelo's this time."}
{"text":"On our way to Wisconsin Dells, my hubby needed a coffee and had the bright idea that he was just going to make a quick stop in Madison. 1.5 hours later, after some sight-seeing and photo taking, and an unexpected lunch, we were back on the road rushing to our next destination... because our family is officially the slowest family on the planet! 

I had no idea Colectivo was a chain coffee shop. It felt 100% independent, and I'm fairly certain I would have spent a lot of time there as a college student. The vibe was great, and it was fun bringing our kiddos to such a cool hipster place. In truth, it was probably a little too hipster, because when my hubby insisted they each eat a falafel sandwich for lunch, they only took a couple of bites and we were on to Quiznos. Can't say we didn't try. Coffee was a bit too strong for me, but he really enjoyed it.

However, I did have the opportunity to try the falafel sandwich, and it was a fantastic value. Nice portion size, fresh and crumbly with a pretty nice spicy kick to it. I didn't try the cucumber mint sauce that came with it, but my hubby loved it so much he used it for his potato chip dipping sauce too. 

From the outside the place looks a bit small, but don't be fooled. Aside from a lovely outdoor patio, there is actually an entire back seating section. We were there around lunch time, and the place was busy but still roomy. 

They sell their own brand of beans, t-shirts, mugs, etc. The pastries looked amazing! I completely regret not ordering up one of their croissants. 

Fun stop for when you want to feel cool. There is a kids menu, but it's mostly \"healthy\" food according to my 11 year olds. 

Take Note: I couldn't get any cellular service in there, but that could have been a total fluke."}
{"text":"Let's get real...

The fact that these guys made it through an INSANE Saturday Farmer's Market and lived to see another day is HUGE in my book. The place was packed... PACKED and with relative ease they got through the entire line. They were slammed... SLAMMED! (Why must I repeat everything in caps? So you know how hard these guys are working to make your time at Alterra memorable!) 

Let's be honest though, there is no shortage of java on The Square, but It's awesome to have such a well know Wisco entity really excel at drink AND atmosphere AND interior AND staff (I could go on...)! A lot of other java joints can't claim that, and for that reason I will certainly be back. 

The space is enormous and I love the different seating areas. Study sesh? They got you covered. Community collective? There's a table just for you! When the patio doors open this summer sitting up front will be a blast.

I hope they can give \"the buck\" a run for it's money. Don't get me wrong, Starbucks is how I started drinking coffee, I'm no hater.... but Myspace is how I started using Facebook and well, sometimes you need to let go of things in favor of better things. Like some awesome iced coffee, a rad selection of tea and food stuffs that taunt you from behind the glass case. I haven't had some nosh yet but I plan to and I'll let you know what I think. 

In the meantime, can we talk about the Terrace looking chairs out front? 

Did you bring those down from MKE Alterra? 

A slight nod to Badger Nation? 

Whatever the case, I like. 

And hundreds more will on weekends when it's nice enough to sit outside!"}
{"text":"Good coffee. Good music. Good wifi. Good people. Outdoor seating. Good size, lots of space and nooks. 2 large community tables."}
{"text":"I visited for the first time after reading all the gushing reviews about this new trendy hip spot right off the square. I knew about Alterra from a good friend in Milwaukee who always said it was the best coffee she has ever had. I needed to know what the fuss was all about. It was during the farmers market that I made my way over, and as expected, the lines were long, service went slow, and it seemed a bit disorganized and uncomfortable not knowing where the line started and ended, and more than one person left due to the large amount of people crowding the entrance. 
The location can't be beat, and the outdoor patio space is large. The indoor patio is excellent, with the windows open and a nice breeze flowing through, its very unique indeed. The coffee was good, the breakfast burrito decent, the service not so much. All in all, I'd say its a great spot to grab a drink after work or during lunch. I wouldn't make it my go to spot for breakfast, but it picked a great time to open with the nice weather upon us. A great spot to chill and linger with a drink and book in hand...but if you're wanting a breakfast spot that won't disappoint, there are better options."}
{"text":"I am so thrilled this place is on the Square! This is what a coffee shop should be, and I hope to see more Alterras pop up across Madison.

First of all, the place is GIANT. I went there during the peak Farmer's Market rush, and they had no issues accommodating crowds from the farmer's market, students studying for finals, random others just wanting a coffee fix, etc. Impressive! I was happy to see that they had plenty of outlets for those who like studying at cafes. They have a lovely little patio out front too, so you can enjoy your coffee and people watch/get some vitamin D.

The coffee is delicious! They sell their coffee beans (roasted in MKE) here as well, which is awesome. You can buy beans of the featured coffee of the week for 10% off. Like most coffee shops, they also sell all kinds of coffee brewing items (french presses, filters, coffee pots, etc). 

They have a nice selection of yummy (and healthy-ish!)-looking baked goods which I have yet to try. The cranberry pumpkin muffin was screaming my name, but I had just eaten brunch at Graze and had snacks at the Farmer's Market, so I'll just try it another time. 

The people who work there are very friendly and know what they're doing/talking about! Always very much appreciated.

They have beer too!!!

After a review like this, I don't know how you couldn't be sold on Alterra by now. My only request for you, Alterra, is to PLEASE open up more coffee shops in Madison!"}
{"text":"Great quality coffee favored by locals in a comfortable surrounding with easy seating.

The staff here was very friendly.  They helped me to choose a coffee based on their recommendations.  They did a nice job educating me on it.  

In our group, we had a non-coffee drinker and our server was very helpful in helping him find a beverage.  We were not rushed.  It was quite busy there, which is a good sign, but it may have been helpful to have clearer signage for us.  

I will be happy to go back."}
{"text":"I've visited Colectivo Coffee on the square multiple times for coffee and lunch. Great coffee, reasonably priced. I haven't tried any yet, but they usually offer 4 made-to-order coffees, which takes a little longer to make. Every sandwich I've tried has been good.

Every time I've been (weekdays, morning or lunch time), there's usually a line, which is great for business but not so great for a quick run-in-and-out to grab coffee."}
{"text":"This is the cutest places I've ever been for coffee! I love the variety of seating options they have. From outdoor seating and a sunroom to indoor seating, choosing where to sit will be hard to choose. 
The selection of food is amazing too! There a are sandwhiches and soups that anybody can eat including vegetarians. 
The coffee is also superb here. The iced coffee taste delicious and my boyfriend likes the iced tea :)"}
{"text":"While the Alterra name is gone away, their coffee is still really good. I stopped in the Fall/Winter season en route to Minneapolis and tried their Turkey Trot pour over. I really liked it! Baristas are great and there's a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"so far my fav in the town! I also love their colorful coffee cups."}
{"text":"I am visiting Madison for the first time and was happy to see this type of coffee shop with wide, open-air seating in a busy, fun downtown area. The iced decaf was a little watered down, but the service was friendly and fast! There was ample seating as well - more than I've ever seen at any coffee shop."}
{"text":"Just as good as the other Colectivo's plus the design of this one is probably my favorite. Great location as well!"}
{"text":"This is a decent spot to get work done. Internet is a decent speed and there is a good amount of space. When it's warmer out there's a lot more space. I normally get the mocha from here with almond milk. Pretty standard drink.
The veggie chili is pretty good. Flavorful, filling and a pretty good option for someone who is hungry but not starving. I would come here if you need time to kill for a bit."}
{"text":"This Colectivo Coffee location is perfect for days when I'm at the theatre.  The drinks are consistently good.  I add Cinnamon to my Mocha for a bit of a Mexican Hot Chocolate flair but without the spiciness of the chilies.  I like the breakfast sandwich and the toast/ jelly.

If Colectivo Coffee would build a spot near Hilldale, I would by-pass Starbucks as my usual spot."}
{"text":"We stopped into Colectivo on Labor Day because they were literally the only place open on the Square. Which means that we were among the masses battling for a table and delicious breakfast. The staff were a little overwhelmed, but they all handled the chaos wonderfully. 

We ordered our drinks and food at the counter. We waited for our drinks and then sat down to wait for our food. I had a cold brew, and my husband ordered the nitro cold brew.  Both were fantastic.  We both ordered a burrito; I had the Chorizo and he had the Potato Bacon.  Both were good, but mine was better ;)

While we were waiting in line to order, I had a chance to scope out the pastries.  So obviously on our way out, I had to go back and get a Pumpkin Cranberry muffin to go.  Which turned out to be an excellent choice, it was delicious."}
{"text":"First, sooo glad this place is open so early! And sort of amazed at the amount of people there even during the 6 an hour - that must mean they're doing something right!

I had a chai tea and several bakery items. The chai was great, the flavor was just sweet and spicy enough. The bakery items (pumpkin Danish and apple turnover) were good, but not amazing. It was still a great breakfast option, and I'm sure I'd return if I lived in the area.

I really liked the space - it's huge, and there are tons of neat plants, and the music was a little loud but the tunes themselves were cool."}
{"text":"I ordered their drip coffee and it was so weak and it didn't taste right!! Almost had an ~instant coffee~ quality about it! Disappointed but at least the cups were cute :P. But for a COFFEE shop they fell short with the coffee...

Also, the service was very slow. 

But I did like the breakfast food I got there! I would recommend getting the food here (although a tad pricey for the small portion!) but skip on the drip coffee!!"}
{"text":"Colectivo is a cool place for any meal. I enjoyed dinner here one evening and lunch the following day. There are a variety of tea options if that's your thing. I enjoyed a hummus wrap and a a curry chicken salad wrap with a iced sporttea. The restaurant has a lovely outdoor patio. Perfect for people watching."}
{"text":"I totally loved this coffee shops. Great service and the coffee taste very very good."}
{"text":"My first experience here was ordering a decaf coffee. I was so disappointed in it, that it took me months before I decided to stop in again. I'm glad I finally did, because they make wonderful lattes, which is a favorite coffee treat of mine. They use Monin syrups and the hazelnut is wonderfully toasty, nutty and sweet. It makes a very good latte. Their proportion of milk-syrup-espresso seems to be just right for me. Rarely do I need to request an extra shot of espresso. 
Pastries are also pretty good. I've tried the chocolate chip cookie, molasses cookie, and one of their bars (7-layer bar I believe), and a couple other pastries I don't remember the name of, but they were flaky and deliciously not too sweet. Good consistent customer service, spacious interior, open windows when the weather is conducive, and a great location, all make the visits pleasant. I have yet to order a plain decaf coffee again though, lol. One day.... one day again I will give it a shot."}
{"text":"Dios mio, stop reading my review and just go now.

I went for a tasty coffee concoction, which I got, but what I wasn't expecting was how good the food was. I got the breakfast pesto burrito, and it did not disappoint.

What else was cool? The open air section of the dining room.

Does it get better? YES, outdoor tables!

I can't wait to go back and try more coffee and more food. I will actively be seeking alternative routes so that I can breeze through this place.

Other than the staples (food & drink), everything else checked out well: friendly staff, good wi-fi, very clean.

Nice job, Alterra!"}
{"text":"I've been burned so many times by this Colectivo Coffee, but it's right next to my apartment and the coffee isn't terrible, so I keep going back.

Their best drinks are their teas and they just started making their own kombucha, which is pretty neat. As far as food goes, the broccoli pesto burrito is quite good, but has shrunk to half the size in the time I've been going there.

My order has come out wrong multiple times and they've also run out of items after I've ordered multiple times. The staff aren't often rude, but also aren't great at dealing with issues like that, often just apologizing and shrugging their shoulders. One time they ran out of a sandwich I had ordered, so the cashier asked me to pick a new sandwich. I did and asked if she could refund the difference, but she said the original sandwich was actually cheaper and refused, despite the menu hanging above her. 

Don't sit near the front door in the winter because the cold air rushes in towards the tables. 

It would be nice if they removed the cobwebs hanging from the air ducts. 

Like I said, it'll do if it's close and you don't want to support the chain places."}
{"text":"Great place to catch up with friends, get some work done, or grab a quick bite. Honestly the coffee isn't my favorite, as it is a little too bitter tasting. However there are still plenty of other drink options! The Revv tea is my go to. It's a ginger-citrus infused tea."}
{"text":"Before a long day of work, my team and I went to grab quick breakfast here. Lots of choices for baked goods, snacks , breakfast items and coffees. 
I ordered the chorizo burrito and croissant to go and my team ordered scones and egg, bacon cheese biscuit. Food was good . Service was quick. Right in the middle of square. Busy at the crack of dawn. Students and government workers walking in to get their breakfast before heading out. No parking, except on the streets so be careful of those parking tickets."}
{"text":"Good coffee and specialty drinks. We come here a lot when we do Farmers Market. They usually have a long line but it moves really fast. I like their ice coffee, I usually add some flavor. 

The only thing is it's pretty expensive and their \"large\" is more like a medium. They do have an extra large but then it gets expensive. The atmosphere is really nice though. I like when they have the doors and windows open for an open air feel. Will keep coming here during Farmers Market for fast, good coffee."}
{"text":"I love coffee. Whenever I think of coffee I think of Seattle. Never the Midwest. But, this place knows how to make coffee. And they offer almond milk as a substitute! They make their lattes strong. 

It's cute that this is a local darling with cafes only in Madison and Milwaukee. I like the seating area with the large leather sofas and the wooden tables. They have an area that could be opened up so that ppl can enjoy their coffee in fresh air. The sink outside of the bathroom was pretty nice to help with the flow. I did buy a mug (clear small tumbler) from them and I love it! 

It's also pretty cool that they sell beer on tap here. Next time I visit I plan on trying some of their food."}
{"text":"Pretty good coffee and pastries. Lots of food options. Good decor. Quiet and work friendly, if you want some time for yourself and don't want to be disturbed. Lots of healthy options available and makes it easier to keep clean eating habits, even when dining outside. Very friendly staff as well!"}
{"text":"No longer my favorite as they limit their wifi on weekends! The two stars are for the wifi, not for the coffee. While everything else stays the same, their service for providing a cozy study spot is no longer excellent! Two stars for the wifi, as they still provides wifi started at 2 PM."}
{"text":"This new addition on State Street is really spot on. I really like the way Colectivo has designed this new place: very bright and colorful (the miss-matched colorful seats make it even funkier!), spacious, and artistic!
If you happen to see the rows in front of the cashiers full, keep going, and you'll find more seats with so many power outlets. They also have outdoor seating for warmer weather...and the second floor with more rooms to study.

 If you are looking for more space to sip on your coffee, study with your buddies or just be lonely with your books on State, this can be a good alternative!

The drinks and food they provide is exactly similar with the one by the capitol.

Overall, this place looks so fun and cozy either to study or just hang out!"}
{"text":"Colectivo is my \"go-to\" cafe. It's a massive cafe with a hipster-inspired aesthetic, but a politician-and professional-patronized veneer. There is usually ample seating with an outdoor 'patio' and an innovative four-seasons, whose windows can open entirely. I drink a lot of coffee but I'm not a snob; the coffee here has never offended me. They also have a sizable menu with okay sandwiches, but I stick to the pastries. They also serve beer contract-brewed for them, it is also decent."}
{"text":"First...I love Alterra coffee and have for years...so I've anxiously been awaiting the opening of their café.  And it lived up to every single one of my expectations!  Not only are the drinks phenomenal (seriously the BEST latte I've ever had), their staff has been equally awesome.  Hip, cool, friendly, laid-back ...just what you want when dropping some cash on coffee!  

The café design itself is also a success...urban gritty feel without being too grungy...love the mix of materials and textures, but the icing on the cake is the operable windows/doors that open the café up on farmers market Saturdays....strictly awesome!  A very welcome addition to the capital square!"}
{"text":"I love this Collectivo. It's in a great location, very accessible, and the service is always speedy. 

The menu offers a lot to choose from as far as beverages go, but they also have a lot of delicious food options as well. 

Whenever I stop in, if I am not already strolling State Street, it's nice that I can park in the ramp next door, run in quick, and leave without having to pay a fee. First 30 minutes free! 

It's usually pretty busy in there, but like I said, service is always quick. The baristas are efficient and very friendly. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular. Great espresso and lattes. Great bakery. Pretty good smoothies (nothing to write home about but definitely worth trying). Great breakfast wraps (get the salsa!) and lunch sandwiches. Not a fan of their brewed or pour-over coffee.

Baristas are all super friendly. Nice indoor patio (with removable windows) and outdoor seating.

Slow/spotty wifi but lots of plugs."}
{"text":"Cute little place with good bakery items and good coffee. I can tell Madison takes their coffee very seriously just by the amount of local coffee shops in the city. It's got some outdoor seating that looks like it'd be beautiful for good weather. I think this would make a great place to study or catch up with a friend or even go on a date. It's got this charm that I can't quite put my finger on."}
{"text":"It's ju st  really over priced food and the coffee never really tastes smooth......   and it's usually freezing in the building"}
{"text":"Pretty good over all. The milk was good, espresso a bit off for my latte, but still ok. Good enough to go back to the next day, I needed some espresso! The atmosphere is great, and the souvenirs were really cool! Probably the best coffee in that little area."}
