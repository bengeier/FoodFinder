{"text":"Avoid this shop.  I sent a review and the owner responded. She thought I was someone else and berated me for not shopping with my daughter.  I WAS shopping with my daughter sorry lady you are treating many customers poorly and you can't keep track. You may want to know that you are trending in social media as a store to avoid because you provide terrible customer service.  We experienced it first hand. The one shop my daughter wanted to go to and we are now referring it to being \"pretty womaned\". Ignored by staff who sell dresses.  Yes that's what you do.  Get your heads out of your butts ladies cause you sell dresses!  You need to start focusing on how you treat customers. Good luck, I think you're going to need it. #bellaboutiquesucks"}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! I went there to purchase my prom dress and it was the WORST customer service experience I ever had. As I walked in the boutique I wasn't greeted nor did anyone come assist me. The two women that was working there that day seemed that they were more interested in sharing jokes with each other than helping a client. They also made me gave me a feeling that theres no point in them helping me from assuming i couldn't afford the dresses there. That's not even the problem. The store did not have the dress i wanted and so they had to order it, unfortunately the last size available was size 8. So i ordered the dress since i really wanted it. The problem is that when I told them that the dress would be large on me if they if they didn't size it down to between a size 4 and size 6. They refused, laughed at the thought of me losing weight. I ended up losing quite a bit of weight and would've fit into a size 4 with a little tightening. However i had to get the dress readjusted 3 times! All because the seamstress and sales associate refused to make the dress smaller and got mad at me when the dress was too big on me at the dress fittings. My experience here made me cry several times, appalled my friends and family, and ruined my prom dress shopping experience! If I could put ZERO stars I would!!!   PS. The dress cost $600+  Please think twice before shopping there or even entering the store!"}
{"text":"I came here prom dress shopping with my niece in the spring.  It is a small boutique on Greene avenue that is well stocked with a lovely selection of evening and cocktail dresses.  They had a mix of dresses that would be appropriate for prom and some for those of us for whom high school is a rather distant memory... they carry mid to high price range lines such as LaFemme.  Service was excellent and professional. There is only one change room, so if there is someone else there, you will need to wait.  The salesperson made sure everyone gets her undivided attention.  A great place to go if you're looking for a fabulous dress for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I visited this store with my sisters bridal party and I can say that I am absolutely appalled by the owners behaviour. I have never experienced such bad customer service, rude and may I say down right embarrassing behaviour from a grown woman. I am a very sensible person and it takes a lot to upset me to the point of writing a review. The maid of honour expressed her desire to size down in the dress she chose and was planning on buying it however the owner preceded to mock her by asking \"Oh your on a diet like the rest of the girls in this city\". The maid of honour replied that she was planning on losing weight and this woman replied \"oh do you really think your body is going change\" in the most belittling tone you can imagine. Then went on to ask if we can order the dress and she replied almost surprised by the question that she doesn't even know if it's in stock.. she made it seem like it would take arm and a leg to check if it was in stock. This woman did not treat us with respect and good customer service, she acts like she is selling haute couture dresses for several thousands of dollars when the quality of the dresses can be easily found elsewhere. I truly think the owner does not want any business from customers as she does not treat them with any kindness. I really hope she will reconsider her behaviour and if you are thinking about going here please reconsider unless you are in the mood to get treated like crap. I think the owner should consider getting some training on how to communicate with other humans as it may increase her conversion rates.. Thank you for letting letting us experience the true culture of Bella boutique."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience to say the least. No store owner has ever treated me with such disrespect. For that reason, I won't be back, nor will I ever recommend this shop to anyone. It's a shame because the dresses are beautiful. The owner should really take these comments into consideration.  UPDATE in response to business owner:  What?? I wasn't in your store yesterday... this was about 1 month ago and I never even spoke to you about your behaviour. Never even bought a beaded dress...I'll say it again respectfully: you need to work on your customer service and take constructive criticism in stride, like most businesses do. If you haven't already noticed, every single one of your responses to Yelp comments are very combattive and venomous. Totally proves my point that you're unprofessional and disrespectful, so thanks on behalf of all disappointed customers. You've clearly demonstrated exactly the type of attitude we wrote about. Best of luck. I will not respond further."}
