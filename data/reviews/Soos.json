{"text":"Been here 3 times now. Two for a group party in the back room and once with the husband.   I highly recommend Soos for your group event. The back room is separated enough from the restaurant that you feel private but it's not completely closed off. They will work with you in advance to decide on the menu and a price point of $40-55 per person for the food. Even at $40 each there is a LOT of food.   The slaw is SO delicious and hits all kinds of notes - sweet, salty, spicy. The char kway teow noodle dish is a star, my husband still talks about it, it has a savoury flavour unlike any other asian noodle dish you've had and you can spice it up with some chilis on the side. I also love the beef sliders and pulled chicken tacos which work especially well in a group/sharing situation. I've also had the short rib and the fried chicken, I'd probably choose the beef over the chicken but both were good. My favourite of all might be the dahl and roti, it's like Malaysian comfort food, lentil stew with a perfectly chewy roti bread.   Cocktails are serious at Soos, I'm not a big cocktail person but they're worth trying. Also get the teapot shots if you're celebrating something!   I'll keep coming back to Soos, a real family run gem on Ossington."}
{"text":"Very Nice Tapas!  So being a foodie with a healthy appetite, I normally avoid Tapas places since the quantities leave me hungry after. But I was curious about Malaysian, so I walked in here before a show at LOT. The stuff is so delicious! The hot wings are the best by far,   followed by tacos and the chef's vegetables. The music is just the right volume. One tip- go in there when you're not famished. And if you are: order the $35 platter of everything."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for a group of 7 on a Sunday evening. A private dining room is available but there is a $500 minimum so we opted for a table in the front of the restaurant. The service was very friendly and attentive - plates came and were cleared in a very efficient manner.  On Sundays, they have several drink specials including $5 rail shots, $6 pints, and $7 wine glasses. On Wednesdays, they have $15 wine bottles.  Since we were such a large group, we were able to try pretty much everything on the menu. Beware - this place is tapas style and the portions can be pretty small.  Out of all the dishes we had, the following are the more notable ones: Pulled kapitan tacos (roasted chicken kapitan, house made tacos, lime leaf, napa carrot slaw, johnny's tzatziki) - 2 tacos per plate. This dish was delicious, and one of the better chicken tacos I have ever tried. Braised lamb poutine (braised lamb, hand cut fries, lemongrass, coconut gravy, quebec cheese curds, fried curry leaf) - This dish served as a great filler. We ended up ordering two of these. This is just your typical poutine dish but the meat is very tender. Reconstructed nasi lemak (coconut rice cake, sambal ikan bilis, cucumber, fried quail egg) -  red chili wings (shallots, fennel seed, peanut, sweet chili) - 2 per plate. This dish was the hit of the evening - the flavours come together in a unique way. Would highly recommend. Satay duo - The duo for our night was squid and chicken. The sauces make this dish as the meat was nothing special. Laksa (chicken, prawn tofu ball, galangal, mee, vermicelli, curry broth) - This dish is a larger size and can be a main for an individual. Very flavourful - we ended up ordering two of these.  Overall, our bill came out to approx. $35/person for food alone. Definitely pricier Malaysian food but glad that the restaurant adds even more variety to the Ossington strip!"}
{"text":"Nice deco and atmosphere. Char kwey teow is just what it is supposed to be: hot, oily and spicy, taste almost the same as in NUS Arts canteen... And the small bottle of sambal ($9) is a must buy. But many dishes are the owner's own interpretation of street food, such as the satay sauce that comes with the shrimp crackers - it has a strong gingery aroma I'm not sure everyone would like."}
{"text":"My partner and I went to Soos on a Friday evening at around 6pm. Very sleek and modern setting with a great looking bar and additionally, a fantastic looking dining room that can be reserved for special occasions.   Understandably, the place was booked up with incoming reservations so we decided to have a seat at the bar. We were helped by a friendly Australian bartender who seemed very knowledgeable about the menu and the specials available that evening. For dinner, we had a laksa and the special short-rib with coconut rice and roti. We also shared a delicious tequila based cocktail that was right at the limit of the perfect level of booziness - props to the bartender for that one.  The short rib beef was incredibly tender (I believe all the meat is well sourced, hormone-free, etc.) and pulled apart quite easily. The laksa was alright, but left something to be desired. The curry gravy/broth had some good flavour, but it was a little watery and oily. The mix of thin and thick noodles is authentic, I believe, but it was sort of difficult to eat and nearly impossible to share (this was our bad, however).   Worth checking out if you're in the area, but if you're looking for good south east asian food, I would go somewhere else like Sabai Sabai. I was really looking forward to this place but it just missed the mark."}
{"text":"Great new place to try, ribs were tender and perfectly cooked.  Desert was homemade and delicious, loved the fact it was a family run place.  Great addition to the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"The service here is really great, and the food is good. It's losing the star because I really think they're a little over priced for what you get. However if you want to try something new, their food is delicious. Great vibe in the restaraunt - we sat at the bar and it was great. Looked like everyone in the place was having a good time!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food, friendly and attentive service. We had the \"feed me\" menu which allowed us to taste many different dishes which were all excellent. Particular standouts included the sambal edamame, wings, short ribs, chicken tacos. Pine-Ana dessert was also delicious. A delightful family run hipster-free zone on Ossington!"}
{"text":"I was super intrigued by Soos when I was looking up restaurants to eat on the Ossington strip. They describe themselves as \"modern interpretations of Malaysian street food\", and honestly speaking, I have never had \"dressed up\" Malaysian food.   We failed to make reservations for a Friday night dinner so we had to wait about 30 minutes before something freed up at the bar. Even thoughteo it was late, the restaurant was still pretty busy, and it was hard to get the attention of a waiter. When we finally were able to place our order, food came pretty quickly.   We order:  - Roti & curry: There was a choice of small or big portion, and we chose the small one, which came with one roti and a small bowl of vegetarian curry (I think had mashed chickpeas). The roti was fluffy and buttery, and the perfect companion to the curry, which tasted great as well.  - Red chilli wings: These have a kick to them! Spicy and sweet with a slight crunch, yum.  - Laksa: The curry broth was delicious - spicy, creamy and coconutty, but not overly salty.  - Char kway teow: Noodles were cooked to perfection and the flavour was great.  - Pisang goreng: Fried banana with bang bang toffee ice cream. So good! Light batter on the banana, and loved the crunch the candied nuts gave. Plus we didn't have to wait in the ridiculous lineup across the street for bang bang ice cream!  One thing that stood out was the freshness of the ingredients. The prawns in the laksa and char kway teow really stood out in their respective dishes. The portions were small (especially the laksa and char kway teow for their prices), but each dish was definitely brought to another level compared to the less expensive restaurants. The menu items were designed to be shared so it would probably make a better experience to come as a group of 4 or more so you can try more dishes from their menu.   Service was attentive and friendly. Because we were sitting at the bar, the bartender made sure our water glasses were always filled."}
{"text":"Had been looking for a good Malaysian/Singaporean restaurant for a while. This is the best so far. Can't remember everything we had but the flavors were authentic and left us very satisfied.   The highlight would be the reconstructed nasi lemak. The traditional one is normally enough for a heavy breakfast. This here was more of a starter. But the taste.. OMG! Really loved it.   The bonus is that the barman, Johnny is a very friendly guy. So are everybody else in the restaurant. Would definitely come back and recommend others to try."}
{"text":"Came here last night  and was so happy with the food/service/atmosphere  that i came again tonight. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Malaysian food in a modern setting - this is what Soos brings to Ossington. Traditional flavours - chicken rice, char kway teow, laksa; and some modern takes - the rendang poutine is one.  With a week of soft open under their well-experienced belts, official opening was today. The room has touches of of east Asia in the wooden slatted shutters and is surrounded by more modern splashes. The restaurant's name is spelled out in mismatched and large block letters along the wall. Spiky and organic-looking lights float over head, and work lamps with dim bulbs round out the lighting. A large room in the back is perfect for groups.  Though tasty, the chicken rice isn't the one I'm looking for. Still far superior than any rendition I've had in kilometres. Grilled chicken breast on a generous portion of rice and presented in a clay pot. I thought the chili sauce (mild) that it came with was very good.  The char kway teow had nicely cooked shrimp on it and the noodles had the right flavour. I still wanted it to have more wok hay, but I'm nit picking. It's a solid dish.  By far, my favourite was the laksa. Nice nutty and rich soup base with both requisite noodles - the fat yellow egg noodle and the thinner rice noodle. The bowl is deceptively small, but filled with fried tofu, chicken, & shrimp. This is best with the sauce on the side - the sambal.  Overall, this is a place you'd want to hit if you want Malaysian downtown. Prices are commiserate with its location - my parents would definitely complain - but given that dearth of good Malay/Sing restaurants, this is a welcome addition to the downtown - and especially Ossington - strip."}
{"text":"The best part about this place was when the old Asian man delivered our food... It felt authentic. Other than that the brisket tacos and the wings were our favourite...everything else tasted  pretty average and relatively small for what we paid."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our visit to Soos. Food ordered packed with a lot of flavour and the portions while not too large were enough given the strong flavours of each dish. We had the mutarbak, smoky fried noodles, redang beef ribs, and salad. All agreed all dishes were tasty. Service was attentive and came by several times to make sure things were good."}
{"text":"I love this place cuz everything is so amazing ranging from the environment to the food. Though the food size is extremely small and pricy."}
{"text":"Decor is very hip and pretty (especially liked the lychee-looking chandeliers), service is friendly and quick. Their menu is tiny and food quite oily. Small portions left us unsatisfied and feeling like we paid a lot for too little. Had the dhal appetizer, which was the highlight. Their homemade shrimp crackers are quite greasy and served with ~one teaspoon of peanut sauce. The vegetarian noodles were oily and spicy - remember the cheap Chinese food you had as a poor student in university??? Yeah! Just like that!! Except not cheap..."}
{"text":"We've eaten here numerous times and will be back as many more.  I read about Soos in an article in the Toronto Star about the family last year-- it turns out the old Mata Hari on Baldwin, an old favourite of ours, was theirs up until ten years ago when Johnny Soo was forced to return to his home country of Malaysia.  When he returned about two years ago he opened this place with his wife and culinary-degree'ed son as chefs and daughter Lauren in front.    There they serve Malaysian food that is at least as good, if not better in the sense of more creative, than the old Mata Hari.  We've been to Malaysian restos all over, incl. the oft-mentioned Restoran on Major Mack in R. Hill, and the Fatty Crab that got famous in NYC (& whose chef wound up on food network) and I can honestly say that Soos is better, more inventive, tastier, punchier.    Last summer we had a big birthday party in the backroom others here have talked about and service was incredible.  The big hit was the pork belly on crispy rosti-style potato cake.  An incredible dish, the kind I would like to be served on the day I die, one of the most memorable things I have ever eaten.  An added bonus is that the drinks, including the 'tea shots' (which are served in tea kettles if a larger amount is desired) are also quite creative and really stand up to the other cool spots on Ossington.  Seriously recommended!!"}
{"text":"The meal was a journey for the senses.   We went with the \"feed me\" option which they served us the best of their best.   About 6 separate course challenged our preconceptions of food.   The first course took us on an ocean cruise where it taught us to play on the upper deck with the sea creatures.   We also partook in the teapot shots. This was a refreshing take on cocktails served in you guessed it, a teapot. These were so good I almost drank a candle.   Highly recommended to anyone that is in mood for a culinary journey that will take you on a world wind tour of Malaysia."}
{"text":"The best Malaysian food in town. Been trying to go here a few times and they didn't disappoint. The pork belly was melt in your mouth good. Went here with a group of 6 and ordered everything on the menu. Loved it. Service could've been better tho but other than that great food and cocktails."}
{"text":"Visited on a cold sat night. No reservation, party of 4 were seated at the bar. No complaint, bartender was super friendly. Food was solid, tasted like the real deal from KL. Would recommend everything ordered. (see pix) like everything on Ossington, it is on the pricy side for the portion, but again tasted good."}
{"text":"4/5! Fantastic Malaysian food- I highly recommend this place for those that like authentic Asian food. For starters, you must try the pulled Kapitan tacos and beef short rib sliders! The apps are definitely the best part of the meal. As for mains, we enjoyed the char kway teow (similar to pad Thai but not as sweet) - however, we were not overly impressed by rendang beef short ribs. We were full but if you are craving dessert bang bang is right across the street :) enjoy"}
{"text":"I went to soos to try out their food at ossington cause my co worker recommended. Nice interior an services is not bad la . Had few item on the menu, first was the hainanese chicken chop for ppls who is hoping to have real hainanese chicken rice don't expect much from soos cause is a grill chicken rice that is not a real Malaysian food. Next was the laksa is just taste like Thai curry with yellow noodles and vermicelli and the Nasi lemak reconstruction was just a tapa it was very fusion and very small amount on Nasi lemak . Nice interior good environment but food not very impressive and pricy."}
{"text":"Well worth the trek into Ossington.   The food was spectacular. We had the rendang poutine, chilli wings, laksa and two of the specials (barramundi sambal and nasi lemak). We couldn't fault any of them.   The wine list was much bigger than I would have expected, but was very good.   The servers were extremely helpful and more than happy to repeat things for my dad who struggles to hear in restaurants.   The decor was gorgeous. A modern take on Malay style. We were trying to work out how to sneak the lamp shades home with us- just stunning.   Overall, a really good night out and I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best Malaysian Resto ever. I drive from Waterloo many times  just to have dinner here. Beef rendang is the best. Good service. Nice place and relaxing. Very friendly owner."}
{"text":"Excellent tasty Malaysian food...love the chilli  wings and chicken rice. We had keropok, wings, char kway teow, Laksa and hainan chicken rice. Enjoyed the quality jumbo shrimps in their Laksa and char kway teow. Will be back to try the rest of the menu! Beautiful decor with antique wooden shutters and amazing Rambutan looking lighting. Great place for date night!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! The food is absolutely delicious. I went with 4 friends and we got the Feed Me, which allowed us to try all of their best dishes. Everything was easy to share and left us completely satisfied. The beef short rib sliders, nyonya oxtail braise, and red chilli wings are must haves! I will definitely be going back to Soos!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious.  The service is outstanding. The cocktails are unique and the location can't be beat.  The char kway teow is fantastic and the pork belly/taro dish was the perfect combo of crunch, sweet, and tangy.  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed our dinner for 4 at Soos.  Happy that we went with the 'Feed Me' or Chef's choice at roughly $35 per person.  Most of the items are on their regular menu, so there should be no surprises if you're a repeat customer.  With the 'Feed Me' option, Soos will adjust the portion size as necessary, and bill by the menu price plus any adjustments.   We liked most of the chef's creations, except the sauce on the pork belly. It's so overpowering that it renders the tacos dish which arrived immediately after it super bland.  We were absolutely stuffed at the end leaving us no room for dessert. Mind you, 3 out of the 4 of us are big eaters. So I suggest that you either come hungry or go a la carte.   Our Singaporean friend commented that the Rojak salad would have costed about $3 in Malaysia or Singapore. At Soos, it is $12. IMO, I don't find their prices too outrageous as exotic or specialty food always commands a premium.  Plus you get excellent service and nice modern decor!   Will definitely return to Soos when we crave modernized Malaysian street food. For a more pocket book friendly version, I highly recommend Restoran Malaysia on Major Mackenzie if you happen to be in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Really delicious food! Attentive service. We're going to be regulars. Have the fried chicken, rice noodle dish, and the cole slaw."}
{"text":"Such authentic Malaysian food! Love the feel of the restaurant. The Char kuey teow and laksa are amazing. The sago dessert was great especially with gula Melaka! Tastes like home! The service was brilliant too! Best Malaysian food by far in Toronto."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Malaysian food. The charkwaiteoy was superb. Loved the slaw and the beef rendang and the pepper prawns. All is all very good. Would go back"}
{"text":"Love the food here, and as a Malaysian I can safely testify that the taste is authentic. Really does taste like home."}
{"text":"Nice place to go on a date. Food was good and subtle, which from what I understand of Malay food is expected."}
{"text":"Checked out this restaurant a month ago. We sat down and was greeted by a friendly and attentive server (I remember her consistently filling our water without interrupting moments of conversation that were on the serious side). Also had an old fashion there and thought it was okay. I have a preference for stronger, bitters that stand out without overpowering with citrus flavor and not too sweet. The one I got here came close but I would still prefer the saint or oddseoul in the same area.  We went tried the - beef poutine - it was ok but I don't really care for poutine (though others at my table enjoyed it) - chili wings - yummy! - Seafood antipasto - ordered as part of our second round of food. While it was well done, it didn't do anything for me (my sister enjoyed it) - pork belly pancakes - a definite must get! - mango slaw - surprisingly tasty and with a hint of spiciness which I liked - Hianese chicken rice was decent - again, just didn't do anything for me - char kway teow - probably the best dish of the night!  - laksa - this was also very delicious   I would definitely come back, though probably only getting the items I really enjoyed"}
{"text":"I was too busy eating the food to take pictures. A must have was the pork belly!! the sliders, the braised beef, slaw, red chilli wings. I could go on and on but just go in and try it for yourself. The staff was very friendly and service was great. Time for me to fall into my food coma :) oh and Wednesday are 15.00 off bottles of wine!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place.  The service was good.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the general theme of this place is \"hit and miss\".  Some things were great, some were mediocre.  Best:  Chili wings, chicken tacos OK:  Pork belly pancakes, lamb poutine Mediocre:  Chips and dips  It's probably best to go with a larger group and order almost everything, then you'll hit all the high points.  With a smaller sample, it's a bit riskier."}
{"text":"Soos is a solid spot and the food is reliable and tasty. My favourite dishes here are: red chili wings, salad slaw, Char Kway Teow (rice fettuccine noodles). The \"Feed Me\" menu at $40 is a great deal for the food you get and the Ossington locale (NB: don't expect Markham value).  The service is pretty good, but there is one hostess/ server who is somewhat pleasant but rarely smiles- she gives off an arrogant vibe, unfortunately."}
{"text":"I am constantly on the lookout for Singaporean/Malaysian restaurants downtown as I miss their food dearly.   Since we weren't that hungry we only ordered the wings and the char kway teow. They were both delicious. Make sure you get the chili with the char kway teow.   One of my favourite childhood dessert growing up in Singapore was sago. I was pretty disappointed with it here- don't get it.  Next time I'll definitely get the laksa, nasi lemak, and the satay."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner at Soos. The food is a Malaysian tapas style.. I had the chicken tacos, wonderful, the mini burgers on fresh baked brioche and the crispy fried chicken also a winner, I highly recommend Soos, its a place to be adventurous."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite restaurant in the city. The food is so unique and well done, you cannot find anything else like it! Their \"let us feed you\" option is your best bet and they serve you so much food for such a great price. The place is a family run place and it shows. They clearly take great pride in what they do and offer excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Really good service but the food was not that great. you know when you travel to a country have amazing food there, come back to your home country and go to a restaurant that serves the same dishes, costs 4 times more but doesn't taste the same - That was sort of the case here...  pork belly pancakes - the pancakes were hard, pork belly was not melt-in-your-mouth tender, and overly salty. Char kway teow - had a nice Smokey flavour (like you could tell it was cooked on a very high temp wok) prawns were cooked well but overall lacked a lot of savoury elements. Laksa - the broth really lacked a depth of flavour, not well prepared."}
{"text":"Small and manageable menu. We got the slaw, house special chili grab and cheese dip, the murtabak beef pancake, and the laksa. The slaw was fresh and flavorful, the chili crab dip was the best of the four, the beef pancake was okay, but mostly disappointed by the laksa. It was somewhat bland. Don't think we would go back again, as we have had food at other places of the same price point but more delicious and flavourful."}
{"text":"Made a reservation at Soos on a Friday night for a group of 9. FYI, for groups with 8+ people, they recommend the \"Feed Me\" option, which is a tasting menu that goes for around $35/person and features some of the best dishes on their regular menu to be shared across the table, family-style. They also let you \"customize\" your tasting menu by choosing which dishes you want to be included in the set for sure. Based on the reviews I've read beforehand, I made sure to ask for the Red Chili Wings, Laksa (spicy noodle soup) and the Rendang Short Rib.  Highlights of our meal included the Kapitan Tacos, Edamame with Sambal (shrimp chili paste), and of course, the Red Chili Wings, Laksa and Short Rib - which all lived up to its hype.  Chili Wings were my favourite - wings were well-seasoned with a sweet and sticky sauce (yea, alright, go ahead and crack a joke here), with a nice kick at the end! Short Rib was super tender. A bowl of Laksa was served to each person at the table and the broth was so flavourful. It was so nice to see that they even kept it real by including both rice vermicelli and thick rice noodles.  Is this tasting menu worth it? I'd say so. We left feeling absolutely stuffed by the end of our meal, and extremely satisfied with the quality of the dishes we had. Service was very attentive as well, which is always a plus when you know large groups aren't always easy to take care of. Atmosphere is pretty chill too, I'd definitely recommend. :)"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place. I'm disappointed that it didn't live up to my expectations. The interior and service were all impeccable. Unfortunately, the one thing that matters, the food, fell short.   We had the \"feed me\" menu for $40. They chose dishes for us to try. We had the pork belly pancakes, prosperity slaw, chicken tacos, char kway teow noodles, and one other meat dish.   The feed me option is presented as a multi course meal. Yet there was no thought put into the progression or inclusion of dishes. We had meat dish after meat dish after meat dish. Each dish was bland or very flat flavours.   There were attempts as complexity with the hints of coconut in the pork belly pancakes only to fall short with the flavorless meat.   The only stand outs were the slaw which had interesting textures, but again lacked flavour, and the chicken tacos, which let's be real, isn't hard to do well."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner. If your a big group best to get the $35 menu and share everything, if you are 2 people - 4 to 6 dishes should suffice to share.  We had the red chili wings, beef short rib sliders (delicious!!!), edamame, and the rendang beef short ribs - OMG sooo good! -  and they came with rice and roti - so filled you up. The ambiance was gorgeous, we had the private room for dinner.   The only thing I didn't like was the waiter - we really felt rushed.  She was pleasant enough on the phone and email where she told me there would be a time constraint of 2 hours and 15 minutes,  I relayed that to my friends and family,  when I made dinner reservations.  But THEN she mentioned to me at the table that we had to leave at a certain time - because 2 of the 12 people at the table hadn't shown up yet.... To remind me again at the table was really poor taste - and this is before we ordered our food!  She rushed us out, was a bit rude to everyone on the table, and didn't ask people at the beginning if they wanted separate bills - rookie waiter mistake, she acted like she owned the place which she might have, but she doesn't know the - customer is always right rule very well, and we were very very well behaved ;) .   I don't know if I'd go back because of the service - I don't want to be made to feel like we are an annoyance, and a lot of my friends felt the same way.  The other waiters were fine, very pleasant, very helpful.  Food was excellent though really delicious - but this is a Tapas - sharing place, and not cheap eats - if you want that there's always Chinatown."}
{"text":"I really wanted to be excited about Soos, since good Malaysian food is few and far between here in the city, and unfortunately had to add this to the growing list of mediocre joints."}
{"text":"Food is good but the experience was horrible- all the servers felt that they were entitled and made us feel extremely uncomfortable. In short, the food was good but not worth the hype hence three stars."}
{"text":"I am surprised to see such mixed reviews on here.  And im reviewing this place solely as a tapas place. Our experience was very nice here! Bare in mind it is NOT a place to come if hungry unless your willing to drop a pretty penny. However that said every item we shared was fab! Nice drink selection to pair with appetizers. Portions are tiny but if you go with the mindset of nibbling of food while enjoying a nice drink you will not be disappointed. Our service was pretty fast and very kind."}
{"text":"The things about Soo's is, you can look in the window at the menu, and maybe or maybe not come through the door, but if you choose not to, you will have missed one of the best meals in the city. Once again, we came for the tasting menu, which was a symphony of tastes and flavours, and no one left hungry. At $35, this HAS to be one of the best tasting menu deals in Toronto. What we love most is the vibe here. Full of family pride and family love, as this family is passionate about the food it creates and serves. Of course, there are many a la carte options outside of the tasting menu. The wine list and cocktail list remain superior as well. Thanks for another great night, Soos."}
{"text":"Delicious Char kway teow - the shrimp was especially delicious. Also such a crispy, delicious roti canai. I could eat that stuff as a meal. Good food at a fair price."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. My wife and I called the night of, an hour or so before showing up. When we arrived advised the staff we were in a rush to catch a show, ordered right away, and asked them to expedite whatever was possible to do.  Staff was friendly and accomodating, cocktails were excellent, and the food was extremely flavourful.  For apps we got the tofu/fish balls with laksa broth (excellent - wish we had also order the proper laksa); and the chicken wings were hot and delicious. One of the staff mentioned the fried chicken is better, but we thoroughly enjoyed these.  For mains we got the char kway teow ($14 - delicious, complete with large juicy shrimp) and the beef rendang ($25 - also delicious although heavy and i was expecting a more watery sauce as i had enjoyed in Malaysia).  The portions are proper foodie adult sizes... never felt like they were undersized.  Thank you Soos. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"So delicious, everything we ate was delicious. The Feed me option is fantastic value and so delicious."}
{"text":"Just had a nice experience and really good meal at Soos. The restaurant is cozy and trendy, fits right in on the Ossington strip. We ordered several things to try different menu items. My favourite was the roti, which came with a flavourful lentil curry and perfect, almost croissant-like roti for dipping. Our server was very helpful with the menu and specials,  and must have refilled our water glasses ten times, which I love. Great spot to share unique, delicious plates with a friend or two, or a date night."}
{"text":"If I wanted to wait an hour for small portions of mediocre food while having lies about where the cooking was at.. well, this is where I'd go.  I'm probably never going to come back.  Why bother?  It's not cheap, the food tastes meh, and you are going to have to wait, and wait, and wait.  And be lied to.  Bye forever!"}
{"text":"First my partner and I had the pork belly pancakes. The pork belly was tough and the pancake was very stiff making eating the dish messy. Just trying to cut into this thing left pieces of cracker (not pancake) flying onto our laps.  If you're going to serve pork belly at all, it better be cooked right or else you are asking your patrons to eat rubber.   The laksa was okay. It didn't taste much better or worse than the typical laksa you get at a hawkers, but at a hawkers you get more soup, an egg and it's half the price. If the laksa is supposed to be redefining Malaysian cuisine, then I would expect that to be done with this staple dish.  We also had the fried chicken, which once again was okay, but still not noticeably above average. All in all that is the overall impression I get of this place. The food is okay, but doesn't leave a strong positive impression."}
{"text":"Small place with excellent service and interesting food. We went for the Chef selection, which was a good choice. Spicy Edamame; tacos excellent a bit greasy; yellow lentil curry good; If it looks like you might not get some prawn crackers, ask for them specially, well worth it. The pork belly was very rich and cooked to perfection. We drank Cava at $50 per bottle and it was fine."}
{"text":"Had a great meal at this restaurant on 06/10/2015.  We tried the pepper prawns, red chili wings and the slaw which were all delicious.  We had the char kway teow and rendang beef short ribs as the mains which were both delectable. The roti that came with the beef was A+ but I found the coconut rice to be lacking in flavour.  We tried the teapot shot (quintessential peach) which was delicious and a really cute and unique concept! Definitely looking forward to coming back again :)"}
{"text":"Came here after a show on a Sunday night and it was quiet inside. I liked the atmosphere: a little sophisticated but also relaxed, and cool decor. The chili chicken wings were outstanding: full of flavour, hor and spicy. They were lacking in crispiness though. Laksa was good: tofu, chicken, shrimp and noodles in a smooth coconut curry broth. It was tasty but didn't have as much flavour as I wanted. We also ordered the murtabak, crispy roti stuffed with spicy ground beef- it was delicious.   Those 3 dishes brought us to about $54 incl tax and tip. I recommend this place if you're in the mood for Malaysian and some spicy goodness. Server was very friendly and attentive. They also have a small room in the back available for booking."}
{"text":"Incredible food, service and ambiance. Must haves are the chicken tacos, edamame, sliders, and my all time favourite the Char Kway Teow. The cocktails are great and 'feed me' option is a awesome way to try a bunch of things on the menu. We have booked the private dining area many times and are always so happy. By far one of the best restaurants in the city!"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing time here at soos.. had the roti, edamame, shrimp chips, wings and beef sliders. And they were all great...especially the sliders. And our server lauren was very attentive. Not to mention her water service was on point"}
{"text":"Came here to see a buddy of mine and sat down in front of the bar. The decor is modern and sleek. I ordered a Salmon sashimi with fried lotus chips and chicken wings. For the entree, i had the beef rendang and shortribs. Let me tell you that this place, puts me back in asia where you take the fresh ingredients and straight to the plate. Fresh and good combinations of flavors. Presentation and service was on point. At the end of my meal, bartender gave me a free shot of Jack daniels. Which they didnt have to but i appreciate it anyways. One of the best places I recommend in toronto."}
{"text":"Really braught back fond memories from Malaysia. We had the chicken wings, sweet and spicy with lemon grass and tumeric, slow cooked beef redang, home made Krupuk, sea shells in a rich coconut curry and a Char kway teow wich really had that burnt streety taste you never ever can do at home without putting your kitchen on fire. We will be back."}
{"text":"Went here by default and was pleasantly surprised!  The decor, the food, the drinks and the service was great all around!  Menu was simple, easy to decide and flavourful!  Tapa's style, so everything was small and app-like.  One of my faves on the menu - RECONSTRUCTED NASI LEMAK - this was almost like a fancy reconstructed rice bowl!  The rice was a plate and I don't know what they sprinkled on top but it was delish, almost like a Korean Bibimbop.  The other starters were deelish too.  CHIPS AND DIP - was a great share choice, the spiced chickpea dip was flavourful, almost like a curry humus dip.  The KEROPOK - prawn crackers and peanut sauce.  The peanut sauce was great, the shrimp crackers are better at Sukho Thai.  MANGO SLAW was good, had some fruit flavours, some cabbage - this reminded me of the LEE FAMOUS SLAW, it was refreshing and a great starter.  REDANG BRISKET SLIDERS - this was a pleasant surprise, the buns were sweet and very much like Asian bread.  Their noodle dish - CHAR KWAY TEOW - was disappointing.  Don't get me wrong, I love noodles but it lacked flavour.  Nice big shrimp though.  REMPAH FRIED CHICKEN - was really delish, it was fancy fried chicken with chill peppers on the side, would highly recommend this!  RENDANG BEEF SHORT RIBS - the malay bread or Roti is the most delicious part of this dish.  The beef was super saucy and fall of the bone.  I would get it for sure, I dipped the roti in the curry sauce from our mussels.  SEA SHELLS - we had the mussels special, it was good, but the sauce it was in was even better.  I dipped my roti in this and was the best thing, reminds me of legit Malay food!    So after eating EVERYTHING on the menu - it was a great experience.  The service was attentive.  The ambiance was nice and well decorated.  Go there, it's def worth a try!"}
{"text":"Update May 4 2016:  I finally had a chance to return to Soos. Without a reservation we had to wait 45 minutes to get a table. We almost went somewhere else but glad we stuck around. The food is just as good if not better than my original meal years ago. Everything was tasty. The spicy char kway teow was our favourite and roti tasted like it was crossed with a croisant.   Original post: I had tried Malaysian food years ago, loved it and did not find another place that served this cuisine close by until now. Soos, does not disappoint.   We went for the 'Feed Me' option where they brought out a samplings from various parts of the menu which was a lot of fun.   While they were all good, based on the things we tried, I would recommend sampling the following ordered from best to good:  red chili wings char kway teow beef short rib sliders pulled kapitan tacos  While the sashimi slaw was good, I don't think I would get it next time.   Finally the sago sago is a coconut tapioca pearl dish that is tasty but not quite as good as the warm version you can get at Koh San Road."}
{"text":"My first Maylasian experience and it was great. Service was good, and atmosphere was top notch. My favourite was the soft shell crab with lettuce, it had a great crab flavour sauce. The other small plates we tried were pork belly pancake and the sliders. All satisfying. Dessert included ice cream from bang bang across the street which is some of the best ice cream in the city. Will come back for more, great spot on Ossington."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Most items are spicy on the menu. Menu was good but not large. Just a few items. Atmosphere and service were good as well. Only thing I didn't really like was that they don't tell you they charge you more for splitting a menu item. Pretty expensive plating fee. Otherwise not a bad restaurant which is worth a visit if you are into Malaysian food."}
{"text":"Lovely meal from start to finish. Very welcoming and accommodating. We got a dhal with insanely good roti, then husband had a Laska and I got tofu tacos. We got sago sago and the fried banana for dessert. Very delicious. Well priced. Don't skip on the cocktails. Super tasty and not overly sweet. Two very satisfied customers."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*  This meal started off great but deteriorated a little over time. We got the \"feed me\" package where you can try a bit of all the chef recommended items. The portions were really big so to be fair, the items at the end didn't taste as good possibly because we were so full.   Food: The red chili chicken wings were a standout item, really tasty. The slaw was quite good. The fried chicken and the rendang beef shortribs dishes were strictly ok, not tasty enough for me.   Drink: I really liked my drink, which was the nagasari - it tasted like delicious wine and lemonade.  Dessert: we tried both the desserts. The pisang goreng (fried banana) was surprisingly not as good as expected, but the sago sago (tapioca pearl pudding) was delicious!  Service: the service was very good.   I would go again maybe once, but it's not on my top restaurants list."}
{"text":"I enjoy the quality of their food and the enthusiasm of their staff, especially after multiple visits. Lauren remembers names and favorite dishes - very personable.  I'm a frequent visitor to Malaysia and so was in search of good Malaysian and Soos has answered my wish!  I enjoy the FeedMe, but please note that it's best when ordered by more than 4 people as the dishes vary for a party of 2. Will look forward to future meals here."}
{"text":"Come here hungry for sure, especially if you are going for the taster menu. Service is great and personable. You can tell they are dedicated to their food, their craft and service.  Thought it put into everything such as changing your plates between courses.    Small improvements could be the stools which are kinda uncomfortable for a whole meal. You can't rest your back on them.   The food is great but my main issue is the food is really heavy. It may be the grease or deep fried nature of the food. But you def don't feel light after eating here. Some of the food has a slight burnt taste to it too but I'm unsure if it's supposed to be this way.   Overall I'd recommend trying this place out though. For a new kind of cuisine where it's obvious effort was put in and top notch service."}
{"text":"Definitely get the \"Feed me\". Chef's choice of their best dishes. Had an incredible meal here."}
{"text":"Picked up take out order on my way to backyard party.  Got the spicy char kway meow which was excellent and very nice with the chilli paste they provide to increase the spice level.  Think of a more mature pad thai with darker flavours.  Ingredients were fresh and I'm definitely looking to have this dish again.  Also had the chilli chicken wings the taste was sweet and savoury with tad bit of heat.  Not spicy enough for me but they were still delicious.  Will definitely be returning to Soos."}
{"text":"Please refer to my review on Soos' Google reviews, since my review was reported/removed by the same hostess/co-owner that everyone else has complained about. As I've mentioned before, the food is decent here. I've never had any negative complaints in regards to the food.  I will not be returning due to her salty and disgusting attitude; such a contrast compared to the other pleasant employees who work here. We didn't appreciate the racial undertones from this same particular hostess either (again, refer to my Google review). It's not the negative reviews that causes more harm than good to this establishment, it's her morbid attitude that needs to drop like a bad habit."}
{"text":"Best place going around. Food is full of flavor and spice. Great atmosphere, friendly staff and the Asian tacos and chicken wings are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Service and food were stellar. We ordered the Pulled Kapitan Tacos, Pork Belly Pancakes (the only complain being the amount of fat), the slaw, and Char Kway Teow noodle dish. Everything was fresh and had  interesting flavour. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I liked this place but I didn't love it.  The service and atmosphere were pretty good, but the food was only decent - or a bit above decent - in my opinion.    The presentation was great...flavors were a bit flat.    Each of the dishes we ordered could have used a bit more umph.  Like the 20 ingredient slaw...compared to Lee this slaw was like eating dry cabbage, it just didn't have the flavor profile I hoped for.  I might give it another try because overall I liked the food and the ambiance, but I just wasn't blown away."}
{"text":"Went here with my friends for the chef's choice tasting menu and everything was incredible! The food here is well balanced in flavour, colour and texture. The servers were also extremely informative, efficient and knowledgable. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Toronto!"}
{"text":"2.5 STARS  To say I was disappointed with this place is an understatement.  First off, the food was pretty good.  I don't have any complaints about the taste at all.  It's a play off of Malaysian street food, with an updated twist. The food was not the issue per say     First off, if you are hungry don't come here unless one of the following apply:  - you have lots of money to spend because the portions are TINY  - you already ate before hand and are just having some small bites with drinks  - you plan on hitting up another place afterwards because you are still starving  We had to get something to eat afterwards because we were hungry.  I decided to go with the red chili wings, the laksa dumplings (the tiniest things I have ever seen) and a drink.  My bill came up to $40 incl tax and tip.  I'm a small person and I was still hungry! Sorry, but I don't know what Malaysian street this is supposed to be.the upper rich side??   I also tried the sliders and the chicken tacos that the table ordered...both good, but tiny once again.  Someone also ordered the roti/dhal dish.  It came in a bowl for the dhal and like 1 tiny roti that was cut up into 5 pieces...so basically a lot of left over dhal.  What a waste  Also, make sure you ask for a separate bill if you are in a larger group. I did so as soon as I sat down which was a good thing because the rest of the table got screwed when they asked for this later in the evening.  Everyone's bill was wrong....so it was a lot of handing over money to this person and that person to try and make things work.   For a place to grab a drink and a small bite this is a great place, but since I don't live close by nor do I want to spend money here only to have to go somewhere else to get more food I think I will pass.n"}
{"text":"This place is better than A-OK... just not four stars for me (I'm semi anti-fusion.. for those who know me).... but I have to say that for a fusion Malaysian place on Ossington, it's pretty solid. I've been here twice. Once with a friend for appies, which was more subpar, and the second time for a full meal, better than par... so here's my joint review.  The first time - I was sad that the laksa dumplings were out so we ordered two smaller dishes to share on our night of food hopping. I vividly remember ordering the shrimp, which came in skewers.. they were grilled fine, but nothing over the top... I can't remember what the second dish was, so clearly not a standout in my mind.  The second time, surprisingly, I got the same set of seats at the bar as the first time and am pleased to see that an establishment such as Soos is ALWAYS BUSY. No joke. On such a competitive restaurant street like Ossington, it's good that an unpretentious restaurant can do so well. That's a super plus.  This time, the pork belly on root chips, pulled chicken tacos, and laksa were shared. I'm not a fan of pork belly but my eating partner really likes it so I don't mind having it once in a while. The layer of fat was glissening and it was cooked really well. The pork belly was super flavourful and the root chip had a nice crisp to it. The chicken taco, continued the road of tastiness with bursting flavours.  The laksa was creamy and had a couple of different thickness of noodles, which was interesting. Along with chicken, there were also deep fried tofu balls. On a cold day, this would be an ideal treat and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  One thing that does not disappoint was the service of the restaurant. The staff is always friendly and efficient and I also see the owner / manager doing a lot of work and chatting to different guests to make sure everyone is satisfied. For those who want to host a party, there's a larger room in the back to accommodate groups.  Prices for generally a little higher but I think it's worth it here. I'm interested to try the $35 chef's choice meal but you're not really going to go wrong with any of the items on the menu."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday with my girlfriends and so happy I did.  The food was wonderful.  We had the pepper shrimps, tamarind calamari, and the spicy chicken wings (a must get!).  It was all so wonderful. For mains we had the beef ribs that was so tender and flavourful as well as the banana leaf sea bass--that was surprisingly so delicious.  Good flavours captured. Definitely going back and will order the same thing!! Watch out for the teapot drinks.  It was surprisingly strong and very delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a very modern space compared to most of the bars on this strip. If they are located anywhere else I just might give them a higher score but considering all that is available in this strip; I think Soos falls a tad flat.  Their tall seats, loud music and brightly lit dining room certainly gives off a cool vibe that might appeal to you but don't get too comfortable. After a drink or 2 and a few dishes later you just might start to feel a bit of uneasiness and self awareness starts to set in as you feel like folks around you might just be a little too close for comfort. The seats don't help either as they are well off the ground and dangling your legs for long periods of time isn't exactly comfortable.  Comfort aside, I find the dishes a little flat as well. The slaw; perhaps their most prized dish has flavours that is very one sided. It's overly sweet and has way too much peanuts that overpower most of your palate. I was surprised to find that there's little to no acid to this dish and there is a lack of herbs (2 tiny sprigs of coriander) which is concerning considering this is an Asian dish. The chicken tacos were also very muted in flavour as well. There seems to be a reoccurring theme of very muted almost bland tasting dishes.  If there is one thing they need to be successful when attempting any Asian fusion dish is to go bold with the flavours. Asian cuisine is about fusing texture, herbs and spices to create bold flavours -- which Soos definitely does not deliver."}
{"text":"Malaysian fusion, tapas style. Very flavourful dishes. I think I wouldn't like the fusion style but they kept alot of the original tastes. The char kway teou was well done, but was missing that \"wok hay\" you get when you're in asia. The nasi lemak was quite good too. The other dishes were ok, nothing spectacular and very standard, like the mango salad and the satay. This place is pretty pricey for malay food (and small portions) but there are limited downtown options!  Note - if you sit by the door, it gets really cold in the winter time whenever the door opens and closes"}
{"text":"I'm behind on reviews but I went here for dinner on October 21st 2017 after checking out the Guillermo del Toro exhibit at the AGO with some friends.  The food portions are a good size despite the super dark environment (ambiance, I guess???).  I had my DSLR with me since I brought it with me for the del Toro exhibit and did a comparison of the food photos I took with my phone -- it was so dark that my phone photos were barely usable for Yelp. lol  The food here is really good and reasonably priced.  The waitresses and waiters were attentive and suggested we get individual bowls for the laksa (a few dollars more) since they noticed we were sharing plates.  A good choice on our end because it was just the perfect amount of food."}
{"text":"A surprised fun as my friend and I were walking along Ossington for a place to eat. What caught my eye was the menu posted outside the window; Malaysian street food. Never seen this around the city before. Curiosity struck!   As we walked in, we were greeted by a friendly hostess. The place is small but was not busy at the time. This was on a Friday evening around 5:45pm. I was struck by the super cool urban decor. The colour combo on the walls And the nice lighting was an eye catcher. I saw a private room in the back, for larger groups, which looked really nice!   The menu is tapas style. Not too many dishes to look through so it wasn't an overwhelming menu. I loved that they attached a glossary of terms for people that don't know the malaysian lingo. Nice touch! Very impressed by this little detail!   We ordered 5 dishes between the two of us. We weren't overly hungry so this was a good amount. I think 5-6 dishes for 2 will suffice!  *please note that this is my second time having Malaysian food so I'm by no means an expert at malay food. Based on what I had, my thoughts are:   Keropok - prawn crackers with a sweet and peanut sauce. Crackers where crispy and fresh.   Roti: vegan curry dhal with a fluffy roti presented in a cute ball like shape. Dhal was soft and just the right consistency. Flavouring was a bit bland for me. Really liked the roti though.  Chicken Kapitan tacos: infused with ginger and tasted ok. Again, it was a bit bland for me. Hard to pick out the individual flavours. This is their most popular dish. It wasn't bad,, but nothing special to me.  Reconstructed nasi lemak: awesome presentation. Very interesting flavours with a quail egg mixed with anchovies, cucumbers, a red chilli bean paste on a solid piece of crispy coconut rice. Again it was a bit bland, but the textures of everything together mixed nicely in my mouth.  Probably the most unique thing I tasted at this place.  Laksa dumplings: deep fried tofu with fish paste in a coconut based soup. The dumplings were crispy and the fish paste flavour was prominent. A good dish to order if you like the fish taste!   The plating of each food was done very nicely. I could tell there was a lot of care put into this. The food came pretty quickly for us and the servers were very attentive. Our water was always filled and they checked in on us frequently.  I think this place has a lot of potential. I would come back and try their other dishes because they all seem very unique. Malay with a Fusion twisted. I also saw that they are hosting a traditional Malay style menu on may 21st. May be worth a try to see the difference between street and traditional!"}
{"text":"Hot tip: Sit in the back room at the communal table which implies less privacy but oh no honey, this intimate and gorgeously decorated nook is where its at. Date spot. Friend spot. Take out your own damn self spot. The service is awesome. The food is Modern Malaysian & amazing (the sliders!). Apparently the crispy fettuccine is a must try. So we did and can, CONFIRM. For dessert? Head to Bang Bang across the street. Sorry Soos - you can try, but you can't have it all."}
{"text":"One of the MOST IMPORTANT reviews you'll ever need to hear for this restaurant.   My girlfriend who was born and raised in Kuala Lampur says the authentic Malaysian dishes here tastes exactly (if not BETTER because of the quality of the meats and other ingredients) than the ones back home. For the longest time she disliked Toronto, until we met almost 3 years ago and I started showing her around. The one thing I could not do was find a Malaysian restaurant that reminded her of home. Without one, Toronto is just another city she's living in. With Soos, I think she can finally feel at home.   Soos is the USAIN BOLT of Malaysian food in Toronto. I don't think anyone can ever come close unless new Malaysian restaurants import chefs directly from Penang or KL. Even then, Soos dishes would probably be served in top restaurants in Malaysia (which explains the prices). Also, I don't think many non-Malaysians really appreciate how good some of these dishes are.  For example, the sago pudding. One reviewer here said it was nothing special, but that's because he's not from Malaysia. My girlfriend's eyes basically rolled back when she tasted it as I looked to her for approval. After a few seconds she still hadn't said a word as she went for another bite. Then another. Another one. Another one. Another one. Finally, she said it tasted legit and that they used the right sugar for it. During that time, I was waiting for some sort of critique. If there's a critique then the food's still fine since we're in Canada mind you and there aren't many Malaysians let alone Malaysian cuisine. If she says nothing then you know it's pretty good. If she says its really good, then you know it tastes exactly like it would back in Malaysia.   We ordered only the Malaysian dishes, none of the fusion dishes like pork belly on pancakes (though it looked very good) since we're testing out how good the Malaysian food is. Beef rendang was cooked perfectly with the right roti (flaky and stretchy), chicken wings were bomb, char kway teow was banquet restaurant quality (can serve to one of the monarchs in Malaysia). Only thing that wasn't great was the curry laksa because they toned it down to appease the taste of the locals here. However I know for a fact that the chef can definitely make it right, and upon checking their Instagram my suspicions were correct. The Instagram has a photo of Asam Curry Laksa that looks proper, maybe I'll make a special request to order it next time. Service was fantastic and my glass of water was always filled.   Speaking of Instagram, check theirs out. So many items not on their everyday menu that the chef is probably wanting to make everyday but the locals just aren't used to are shown here. (This is similar to the Chinese food scene here in Toronto back 15-20 years ago. Toronto & Vancouver now have the best Cantonese Chinese cuisine outside of HK). I mean they even had their grandma flown in to prep for their Malay nights, how much more Malaysian can you get!?  Soos thank you very much, you have a repeat customer in us! The final test would be bringing her mom and sister next Sunday for the final verdict. I'm sure they'll like it and would no longer go to Restoran Malaysia; which has been going downhill in terms of taste as of late. And maybe now I could finally put a ring on her ring finger =)!"}
{"text":"I went there with the family, we really enjoyed it. They had some gluten-free options for my aunt and some decent vegetarian options as well. It was cold near the door they had a giant curtain to keep the heat in but it didn't work for a well! Other than that, excellent food and service. It's both authentic and fusion. Although I'm not 100% on this, I do believe that the people running the restaurant are in fact Malaysian, which is nice!"}
{"text":"Recommendations: - Red Chili Wings. Perfectly cooked wings, with just the right amount of sauce. Some of the best wings I've ever had. - Rendang Beef short ribs. The beef is very tender, and the sauce is delicious. - Char Kway Teow. This was excellent.  Also Tried:  - Laksa. This was middle of the road. The curry broth is excellent. It is similar to the Khao Soi Gai at Sukho Thai.  I don't understand why so many of the thin vermicelli noodles were included. The chicken was quite overcooked, and the tofu didn't really go with it. Still, the curry was great. I think it would be much better with some sort of fish or fish cakes  - Reconstructed Nasi Lemak. I didn't like this. I think it needs a lot more sauce, as the result was simply too dry. Perhaps it just doesn't work as a bite sized appetizer?  - Satay. It's good.  - Hainanese chicken chop. The chicken is cooked well, but it's a simple dish. If you want something without much spice, this can be ordered.   I wasn't satisfied with the Laksa or Nasi Lemak, but they both have a lot of potential, and I hope they'll improve with time.  The service is really excellent. We had a party of 8 and they were very friendly, practical and attentive."}
{"text":"I'm Singaporean ! And am so so so happy I found Soos! Now I've a place to get my local fix. We came in a group so we ordered the Feed Me option. We got Chilli Crab in cheese , sambal chicken wings, Coleslaw which I think was supposed to be Lo Hei, Murtabak, sambal Salmon or and these chicken tacos that tasted like satay oh and Kway Teow! EVERYTHING made me think of home and made me feel so satisfied. I will be coming back to try Laksa and the Beef Rendang! I can't wait honestly . Most authentic tasting dishes I've had outside Singapore / Malaysia !! Thank you Soos for not adjusting the flavours and for keeping it real. Literally love you guys."}
{"text":"1 Star for playing classic Motown & Soul all night :)  Diatribe:  Malay food is so so so good. Toronto doesn't have many Malay options. Soos was to be a welcome addition. Possible a go to Malay resturant for Toronto.  Years of working and living in Singapore makes you learn quickly that IMO, Malay food is the Italian cuisine of Asia. I know what that means to me, and it has alot to do with variety, simplicity, flavours and that it is the quintessential comfort food.  Disagree all you wish, but I am sure you at least agree that...  Mee goreng Rendang  Satay Char Kway Teow Murtabak Nasi Goreng  ...should all be on this menu. That they aren't at Soos (regularly), and I see that as missed opportunity.  Yes I saw the menu in advance, and yes I knew that unless they had these as specials, most of these wouldn't be available.  I asked for each of these items, completely willing to order them all for their trouble. They had 2 on the menu. Shame. I was told that I could call ahead and make a special order. Like takeaway, that you just eat there, but you have to order in advance. That is not how I understand a restaurant....that is calling your Nonna to get her to make her specials meatballs because you are coming over next weekend with your new girlfriend.  Diatribe done.  Review:  The waitress was nice, very patient and very knowledgeable. Everything we ordered was great.  They accommodated a request that all dishes have their heat reduced (mother request) +1 They were quick to accommodate a request of my toddler. +1 Food was brought out quickly. The Char Kway Teow portion is small, not for the sake of it, but for the price. The murtabak was good   The restaurant does the alot things VERY well, this is a very well managed restarant with great ambience and staff.  Menu is lacking Malay staples, but not flavour."}
{"text":"As someone who was born in South East Asia, Soos' food tastes like home to me. We ordered few different dishes to get a variety, and they didn't disappoint! My personal favourite was the red chili chicken wings. It looked so simple, yet very rich in flavour. I would not hesitate to order again. The beef rendang was so tender, and it melted in my mouth. The laksa dumplings was very tasty. We ordered pork belly pancakes and it was also very good. Out of all things we tried, the char kway teow was the one that felt a little standard to me. Despite of that, majority of the food hit the right note to me. I will be back, hungry for more!"}
{"text":"About halfway through a seriously magnificent meal at Soos, my dining companion noted that it was the best meal he had had in a very long time. I was hard-pressed to disagree.  We arrived at Soos at around 6:00 on a Sunday night and were grateful to see that tables were available. (We had already tried a couple of other restaurants.)  The menu consists mostly of sharing plates, so we ordered the following:  Pulled kapitan tacos (chicken kapitan, house made 'tacos', napa carrot slaw, johnny's tzatziki),  pork belly pancakes (nyonya sticky soy pork belly, crispy taro root pancake, scallion), and  rendang beef short ribs (rendang curry braise, coconut rice, roti).  We started with the tacos, and though very small, these packed a hell of a lot of flavor into each bite. I especially couldn't get enough of the small, crunchy pieces of chicken thrown into the mix. I could've eaten about 100 more of those things.  Ditto the pork belly pancakes. The \"pancakes\" were actually very crispy and, from my perspective, kind of took away from the deliciousness of the pork belly, so I ate them separately.  Finally, the short ribs were mind-blowingly tasty. The meat was super tender and the curry braise was nothing short of exquisite. Again, it was a small portion, but so, so good.  Everything was so amazing that we absolutely had to order dessert, so we got the two sweet items on the menu:  Pisang goreng (fried banana, bang bang's daily ice cream, candied nut crumble) and  sago sago (tapioca pearl pudding, gula melaka, pandan, coconut).  I'll admit the sago sago didn't do much for me. It's essentially a spin on tapioca pudding and it was just too subtle for my demanding tastebuds. (I should point out that my dining companion loved it, however.)  The pisang goreng, on the other hand, was absolutely incredible. The fried banana and candied nut crumble were astounding, and the Bang Bang ice cream, burnt toffee, was typically sublime. (It was especially gratifying to enjoy this dessert given that we had a perfect view of dozens of suckers standing in an insane lineup for Bang Bang.)  Soos also offers a $35 per person option where they'll feed you a selection of their offerings, and I have no doubt that I'll be returning to sample that."}
{"text":"Checked out this place on a Friday evening to try their food with some friends. Cute interiors and atmosphere. The place is dimly lit, which makes for nice ambience. The spices in their food were flavourful. Service was also friendly. To my surprise, it was not as packed on a Friday evening but then again, I came here during a snowstorm lol.  This place is a tad pricey though for small portions. I'm glad to say that I've stopped by and tried this spot as I don't think I'd come back. They also serve dessert and their ice-cream is from Bang Bang, which is right across. Nothing too memorable from this place but a cool spot for a large group."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. He was born in Kuala Lumper and it's difficult to find Malay restaurants in Toronto, so we were pretty excited. Sad to say that although the food was decent, nothing was very exciting or memorable.. except for my cocktail (called King Bill Buzz) which was very tasty! Can't complain as long as the booze is good! We had the $35/pp \"feed me\" menu which is basically the chef's picks off the menu, but the waitress let us choose a few items ourselves that we specifically wanted to try. We thought that there would be some special items on that set menu, but they were all dishes off the regular menu. Had I known, we would've just chosen everything ourselves. I think we just had high expectations for a classier/pricier Malay place, but we both prefer Restoran Malaysia where the food is much more flavorful/ plentiful/cheap. The atmosphere here was nice and service was good."}
{"text":"The 5 of us went to Soos for their feed me menu, where they customize a menu for you within the cost of $38. Service was awesome. The water kept coming and being refilled, which you really need cause we were all thirsty all the time! We were also sitting in the back, where it was quite stuffy. It's a small place and we tried twice to get a reservation, but it's worth trying the tasting menu.   Overall the food was very tasty and it comes quick! It's about 1.5 hours for the rounds of food to be done. Mostly bite sizes for the tasting menu, but it wasn't filling (for me or my friends)! As a small female, I didn't find myself full or close. We ordered two extra dishes and then I went across to bang bang for a double scoop of ice cream!   FOOD: Spicy sashimi salmon on nori, pork belly, tacos, sliders, beef roti were all my top choices! The thought put in the dishes blended well and showed creativity. The sliders were good as well. Edamame and chicken wings were good, especially the edamame, but too salty. The salad slaw had too much dressing. The one that threw me off the most was the 'char kway teow - tiger prawn, chives, sambal, beansprout, egg drop, charred rice fettuccine'. It wasn't fettuccine whatsoever! We were confused when they said it was fettuccini. It's flat rice noodles aka hor fun/ ho fen/ shahe fen. The rice noodles was mushy/ overcooked. The chili sauce on the side was excellent! Must try (if you're into spice!)  Overall, highly recommended! Definitely a great place to go for a tasting menu. Small, but great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous little spot on the Ossington strip. Met a friend for a weekday treat, and we both loved the food. We decided to order the tacos (one tofu and one chicken, the laksa and the shrimp and egg noodles and the laksa. All of these were really well made and has layers of flavours to them! My favourite for the laksa that had tons of coconut milk in it, which I love! For dessert we shared a sago pudding which was okay, but that's just me as I'm more of an ice cream/chocolate person! Attentive and engaging service and cute spot for a date night or a night out with friends! A bit pricey as we paid $60 for 2 with no drinks, but still nice for some special evenings."}
{"text":"As a Malaysian I can say this is truly authentic Malaysian cuisine. The dishes were a notch above what you'd typically get (ie short ribs vs stewing beef for rendang).  Finishing with sago for desert was amazing  Quick note. It's not deconstructed NASI LEMAK. It just NASI LEMAK."}
{"text":"Wow.  Just, wow.  I found this restaurant via a Google Maps search of the Ossington strip, and was intrigued by the description \"imaginative Malaysian street food\".  I had no idea what that could be, and that's generally an excellent reason to go to a place from my way of thinking.  We had reservations for a Saturday night, and that would be important - the tables are spaced comfortably and are large enough for many consectutive smaller dishes, but it's not a huge place, so I could imagine disappointment on a nice spring or summer evening.    There were four of us dining on this night, and we chose the $35/person \"feed me\" selection of shareable dishes.  That was an excellent choice for a first visit, and likely will be for a second visit as well. There were a lot of dishes in small portions, spaced really well through a 1 1/2 hour meal so we never got uncomfortably full and didn't feel rushed.  There really were no weak dishes among the roti, pulled kapitan tacos, red chili wings, laksa dumplings, sawarak pepper prawns, soos' slaw, beef short rib sliders, char kway teow, and fish dish served to us.  (No pork belly pancakes for us because of an allergy.)  The order of serving was good too - always a more subtle dish followed by a spicier dish, and repeated.  (I really enjoy slaws - theirs in particular was a real treat.)  We were really pleased with the service too - friendly, attentive and timely, and they explained everything well.  My wife and I should have shared the pisang goreng (fried banana dessert with ice cream from very popular bang bang across the street) - it's a lot after a big meal, but absolutely was delicious too.  I want to go back, again in a group of four or six.  The sharing, variety and quality made it a great experience."}
{"text":"Soos is the only restaurant in downtown town Toronto that I know of doing Malaysian cuisine and I made my way all the way to Ossignton to have satisfy my char kway teow craving. Although the dish itself was decent, it lacked the complex flavour one would expect from a noodle dish stirred fried in a hot and seasoned wok. The service was lacklustre and the price ($18 )did not justify the quality of food that I received. The menu also lacks focus (edamame? Really?).  The hostess is also very confused. When I asked to be seated for one it took her 5 minutes to figure out where I could be seated. She literally went through there reservation list/ table plan with me and repeating when the reservations were. There were only two other customers seated in the restaurant at the time."}
{"text":"Tea shots were tasty and novel. Wings.... As mentioned in other posts were the best we've ever had. The gingerita was fresh and strong. Service was attentive, even as the Satirdayevening crowd picked up. Would be here very frequently if we lived in town!"}
{"text":"+.5 for service  I recently took my parents along the Ossington Strip, since it's an area with an unique array of cuisines. After observing each restaurant, we settled with this place due to its interesting menu. Since we didn't reserve, we had to wait for about 30 minutes on a Sunday night.  The menu isn't very extensive, but the choices give you the cream of what Malaysian cuisine is all about. We had the red chili wings, rendang beef short ribs, char kway teow, beef short rib sliders, laksa dumplings, and the sago sago.  Every single dish was uniquely made and tasted between good and excellent. The only drawback was the char kway teow, which tasted decent but lacked the high uniqueness standard of all the other dishes. The sago sago was also nothing too special, but since it was a dessert item I didn't really care too much about it.  Service was excellent even though the items took a while to come, but hey with high quality food comes a longer waiting time. Definitely a place I would visit again, even better if they change the items around every so often."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night with some colleagues. The atmosphere was dim, the seating was limited and felt cozy.  The servers were attentive and knowledgeable. The food was quite tasty, particularly the short ribs. This is a Malaysian tapas place so it gives you the opportunity to share various dishes with friends. It was an interesting experience and for three of us, we ordered about 5 dishes or so. None of us were particularly very hungry, but it was enough to satisfy us.  If I am ever in the mood for tapas Malaysian in the area, I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"My friend picked this place out for a girls' dinner out. I don't know anything about Malaysian food, but we ordered the $35 chef's choice and they brought out tons of delicious food.  An amazing deal and the service was great too. There was a slaw that was reminiscent of Susur's Singapore Slaw (and a lot cheaper with this deal). Will definitely come by again."}
{"text":"This Ossington gem has been done Yelp injustice, so let me be the 38th honest reviewer to give it the five stars it deserves :3  Like every other resto on Ossington, Soos sits in the confines of a small, narrow space with high ceiling tops.  Decor is exquisitely modern, offering both tables and high tops.  We sat near the window, with a full view of Ossington and its dessert counterpart Bang Bang Ice Cream right across.  Funny that Soos actually offers BB ice cream on their dessert menu, for those who want to avoid the line across the street presumably .  Started off with the quintessential peach teapot shot.  Liquer in a teapot, novel concept?  I liked it, a bit strong but I recommend for the novel experience.    The food was delicious in every single way imaginable.  1) Red chili wings shallots, fennel seed, peanut, sweet chili Finger-lickin' good.  Kinda spicy, but definitely delicious and one of the best wings I've had. Ever.    2) Char kway teow tiger prawn, chives, sambal, beansprout, egg drop, charred rice fettuccine MY FAVOURITE.  Honestly, I could've eaten 5 plates of this and not regretted any part of it.  Tastes especially delicious with the little bit of pepper paste it came with.  Just wow.    3) Pulled kapitan tacos chicken kapitan, house made 'tacos', napa carrot slaw, johnny's tzatziki Cute dish and pretty yummy, not as big of a standout as the first two but still good :)   4) Sashimi slaw My least favourite dish of the night unfortunately; we were told that 129389481 ingredients went into this plate but in the end it just tasted.. confusing.    5) Rendang beef short ribs rendang curry braise, coconut rice, roti I liked the roti and coconut rice more than the actual ribs.  Carb heaven, worth every calorie.  Also should note this was shared among a party of 3 and we were all decently full after.   I freakin' love this resto.  That is all."}
{"text":"Great Malaysian restaurant up Ossington, especially if you're looking to experience other Asian flavours besides the more common cuisines. The laksa is a must as it's probably the most well known traditional dish. It's fairly portioned and very savory. The char kway teow was a great choice as well. The only thing is the prices are fairly high considering what you're getting (i.e. Asian food, and not very large portions by Asian standards), but in general the prices are fair relative to the other nearby restaurants. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This was the best meal I've had in a very long time! I give it 10 stars/5! It was everything I had no idea I was craving. Everything was stellar from the cocktails to the food to the decor to the staff... the service was unbelievably quick too! Order the roti, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I went to Soos for dinner with a friend that lived in the neighborhood - really nice place, the service and atmosphere was just right...  We shared the following dishes, and highly recommend them all:  - pulled kapitan tacos - nyonya oxtail braise - rendang beef short ribs  I will definitely be going back to try the rest of the menu..."}
{"text":"Amazing discovery while strolling along Ossington this weekend. We were promptly seated at the bar and got served very fast. We started with their sambal edamame - and, believe me, when even your edamame is outstanding, you are in the right track.   We weren't really hungry, just wanted some munchies, and the tapas were delicious and the right order for the kind of night. I would strongly recommend their sashimi slaw - so many flavours and scents I can't describe in a review, you have to try it yourself, and can be made vegetarian as I have been told.   The bartender was extremely nice and I HAVE to go back there just to try his cocktails - they all look incredible."}
{"text":"Great food and ambience.  Service has room for improvement and so does the drinks lists. Suggestion to carry wines that complement your amazing food to heighten the combined experience."}
{"text":"What a pleasure this little gem was! Everything from the food, drinks, service and design were spot on at this Ossington resto! We wandered in on a cool spring evening, drawn into the space by the warm lighting and bustling vibe. They could only accommodate us at the bar which ended up being very comfortable. We were unsure of what to order never trying Malaysian food before so we opted to try the \"feed me\" option. Boy was this a good choice. Each dish was delicious and very different from one another and by the end we were stuffed. My personal favorites were the prosperity tossed slaw with a whole bunch of different elements that kept me coming back bite after bite and the wonderfully rich curry laksa. I have not experienced such depth of flavour ever in a noodle soup! To finish we added the fried banana dessert with Bang Bang Ice cream from across the street! It was so yummy! Cocktails were great! Well balanced and unique. We tried several and all stood up to any cocktail bar in the city. I was informed by our bartender that this place is family owned and run. It really shows in the quality. This place is clearly a labour of love and I highly recommend it! 5 STARS- Great job Soos"}
{"text":"Ok, this post is long overdue. I had a party of 12 in the private dining room. We had friends visiting from out of town so wanted to take the somewhere on the Ossington strip for good food and drinks after. If you've read some of my other reviews, I'm all about the total experience. Of course the food has to be good, but so should everything else in my humble opinion. Since we were a large party I booked in advance via email. I dealt with Lauren (one of the owners) and she was super communicative, friendly, and accommodating as I had to refine my reservation a few times. The decor is nice and warm and was perfect for our group. Cocktails were good and the food, served family style for sharing was very tasty and came in good portion sizes. We were totally stuffed by the end of our meal and had leftovers for home.   If you're booking for a larger group they have very reasonable priced tasting menu style set menus. I def recommend going for it as it will save you the work of picking and choosing, yet you'll be able to sample the majority of items on their menu.   The added charm of this place is that it's a family owned and operated resto and everyone seemed to pitch in at some point to interact with us, whether running food, filling water glasses or taking another drink order. All in all an extremely positive experience from start to finish. I even got a nice follow-up note from Lauren thanking us for coming in and inviting us to dine again.   We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  Their roti is something I've been looking for in the city for a long time.  The service was very nice and prompt as well.  The prices are a bit high but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Overpriced by a lot. Food wasn't anything special. I wouldn't call myself an expert, but I've eaten Malaysian food elsewhere (both in Malaysia and in other places) that was much better. I was excited to try this place. There's a Malaysian-shaped hole in the Toronto food scene. For me, Soos does not fill it."}
{"text":"I usually follow new restaurant openings on torontolife.com. Asian cuisine is my idea of comfort food so it wasn't long before we showed up at this place. They only take reservations over the phone, so do call them just to be sure that you don't go back disappointed. We went on a slow sunday evening, so there were enough tables for walk ins.Our server was very polite and attentive (i remember how she diligently filled up water in our glasses)  We had a couple of cocktails, one of which was meh. The other one had a nice aromatic flavor profile which my wife enjoyed.  We ordered one appetizer and couple of mains to share. The red chili wings tasted as good as they looked with finger licking seasoning on it. I also quite enjoyed the charred rice fettucini with shrimp. It had a great kick to it due to the spice and it was nothing like what I've had before.   The creme caramel dessert was a nice way to finish the meal.  I can go back just for the chili wings and the charred rice fettucini :)"}
{"text":"Great food and lovely atmosphere. Staff are friendly and helpful. The modern interpretations of Malaysian foods are lovely: we had the seafood special which was Mahi Mahi, Scallops  and Shrimp, in a mild curry with rice and veggies. Our second dish was a Laksa which was chicken, tofu and shrimp in a curry sauce with noodles. We will definitely return here in our next trip to Toronto!"}
{"text":"Went here a few days ago with a work friend and had a great time, people were friendly for the most part even though our orders took a while to come out. The place has an unusual design scheme but it works for the area which tries new things. We tried to schedule a large group to dine here but was hit with so many onerous rules regarding the number of people, $150-$200 deposit or advanced payment that really through us off. It's good for 2-4 people, not large groups.  The food here is really good, freshness really does stand out, especially when you're working with Malay/Singaporean aromatics and vegetables. The only issue here is price, there are a few other places around the city that do the exact same thing for a lot less, even in Singapore (having visited for work a few times) most of this food would be less than $5/ plate. Regardless you're paying for the ambience and service instead of a market food stall in a commissary."}
{"text":"My overall impression is this place is great and will do well.  The ambience is warm (actually very red), the food is excellent. It's taken traditional Malay cuisine and puts a typical Torontonian fusion spin on it - effectively turning normal cuisine into a unique and palatable upper experience so other less adventurous food lovers will try cuisines from different ethnicities... and enjoy it.   But with this also comes the negative i see happen so often in Toronto - small dishes at high prices... effectively with a bad price to value ratio, but great taste to flavour ratio. It's really not a nice feeling to leave a restaurant hungry after spending a decent amount. Why don't more chefs understand this?   I will applaud Soos on one thing - they haven't fallen into the Ossington trap of terrible service. The waiters are well trained and on point at Soos. Though i do think the restaurant needs to get used to large group service."}
{"text":"I was starving by the time we got here. We ordered the sampling menu (no allergies, no food sensitivities or restrictions or dislikes), $38 pp.   FOOD: The edamame were the first dish and although uniquely seasoned (i.e. Fried with chili flakes and salt) - they felt like a filler.   Next came the curry dal and puffed bread. Bread was fresh and warm. Dal was underwhelming meaning it did not have a complex flavour profile, the main spice was turmeric.   This was followed by 4 shrimp skewers and a sauce which were delicious.   Next came the chicken taco which was good but not great.   Then, the 20 ingredient salad which is not as good as Lee's unfortunately. The dressing could be better (i.e. More complex flavour profile). The salad had something mildly bitter in it (similar to grapefruit) which I liked but not everyone would. I liked the fresh crushed peanuts in the salad.   Finally we had the staple noodle dish with a few shrimp thrown in and hot sauce on the side. The hot sauce was fantastically hot- I would use it cautiously. But the noodles were nothing special. I was disappointed.   My friend had been numerous times and he says their best dishes are the chicken wings (which were not part of our sampling menu unfortunately).   SERVICE & AMBIENCE: Attentive service meaning my water glass was never more than half empty. The owner brought some of the dishes himself. Our waitress checked in a few times. Unfortunately I did not appreciate seeing her cleavage (as fantastic as it is) so often when she bends down but perhaps others do ;)   Ambience is nice enough. Some cool light fixtures and wall paper.   Would I go back? Yes but only to try the chicken wings.   Would I recommend to a friend? Unlikely"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant!! I've been here a few times and the food and drinks are excellent. Everything is fresh and beautifully prepared. All of the dishes are delicious and the bartender is well-versed with their drinks and made some great recommendations. The atmosphere is warm and casual and I highly recommend SOOS to anyone."}
{"text":"Went to Soos recently for a dinner with my family and had a mostly lovely experience. Malay food was a huge part of my upbringing and every bite had my parents and I turning to one another and exclaiming that it tasted like something my grandmother would make.  Standouts were the evening's special, a whole roasted sea bass, and the pork belly pancakes. We also had a delicious curry and soup. Absolutely delicious from start to finish, though I found service could be a little curt. We also had a family next to us whose three small children were essentially having a food fight which the server ignored completely. I got a handful of salad(?) thrown into my lap and the servers seemed completely unconcerned with the ruckus."}
{"text":"We always enjoy going to Soos the food is consistently good and flavourful. The menu is not huge but it is always great. The service is always freindly and accommodating and it is located on Painting which is a great Street for an after dinner walk."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a place that does home proud when it comes to Singaporean /Malaysian food.   Soos we a neat place that did just that along with a ton of neat fusion combinations added into it.  It tasted like home but the price they charge is more than what I'd pay for.   It's a neat place to try once but I wouldn't be returning as there are other places that are comparable for a more reasonable price point and taste."}
{"text":"The food on it's own + value for money could be slightly improved but the overall takeaway from our dinner here was amazing - the impeccable service being the star of the night.  Our server (the owners daughter I believe) was my dream server. Super clear, efficient, on the ball and knowledgeable, all without being annoying in the least. As soon as I inquired about their gluten free options she immediately asked if I could have soy sauce or not - a telltale sign she knew what celiac was vs. trendy gluten free fad dieters and I knew I was in safe hands.   Without missing a beat she listed off all the menu items that were celiac safe gluten free and which could be modified to accommodate my restrictions. So many options! I could eat most of the menu and for once didn't feel like I was stuck ordering the most boring menu item due my dietary restrictions.  Even when I asked if my Laksa could be made without the chicken she immediately told me it was also made with chicken stock as that might affect my choice - something few servers would do (I feel like so many servers have no friggin clue what's in the dishes they serve which makes no sense to me..).  Our dishes came out in perfect timing, were described to us while being put down, were beautifully plated and mine was always handed to me with a mention that it was gf and celiac safe. SO AMAZING. I cannot applaud this level of service enough. Our water was always full, our plates and utensils changed for each dish, and our server checked on us just the right amount without being too in our faces or too absent. THIS is how all restaurant service should be.  The food was really really good but there were some dishes that fell just a tad short. I also felt the prices were pretty high based on the quantity of food but the quality was always there. Anyways - a small flaw doesn't take away from the amazing service (seriously - she should go train other restaurants how to properly operate - she was outstanding) and the great vibe of the place (it's beautiful and cozy inside!).   For our table of four, all the shared plates, 4 cocktails and 1 dessert came to approx. $200 before tip. As I mentioned, it is a little costly considering the portion size (we were satisfied but not super full) but the overall experience was perfect. Also need to remember we are on the Ossington strip so most restos are a little pricey. Anyways,I would rather have a great night out and not be stuffed than get huge portions in a shabby place with crappy service any day. Plus, sometimes you gotta treat yourself!  We had a wonderful night here and will definitely be back! (i'm thinking tasting menu for bday dinner..?!)  PS - you can buy a jar of their house-made hot sauce to take home! Do it - it's amazing !"}
{"text":"Soos goes to show you can still find nice little gems in the Ossington strip. This is a fantastic space decorated with lots of taste and some truly inspired offerings.    First off, I don't understand the criticism over their pricing. Most of their dishes range from $10-20 and the portion size is actually spot on, especially if you are sharing a few dishes. I can't help but make comparisons to Lee/Bent, which have some similar dishes and even higher pricing. I'd have to say that I personally like Soos better as it made a much better impression on me overall. Another bonus is their professional, courteous service and it makes you feel that much better when you learn it's a family operated joint.    The slaw tossed with plum sauce packs a plethora of flavours and textures. The peanut and plum give a light savoury dimension to the dish while the tartness and heat from chillies make pleasant cameos.      The spiced yellow lentil dhal with roti is so simple but made to perfection. The roti is so buttery and soft like a fresh croissant. The dhal has a perfect combination and potency of spices.   Pork belly pancakes are awesome. A delightful contrast between the super crispy pancake bed and soft generous hunk of glazed pork belly. The richness of the pork as well as the sweetness of the glaze coat your mouth a lingering flavour.   As good as everything else is, the laksa is the showstopper. Firstly, the chicken and prawns are cooked to perfect tenderness. So many places overcook their meat in the broth, not here. The curry broth is so rich and silky with the coconut milk you are going to sip to the very last drop. My favourite thing about this dish is the spongy tofu because they are like little grenades that explode inside your mouth with everything that is good about the laksa."}
{"text":"My experience at Soos was very disappointing. There was a sanitary issue that occurred during our meal, but the restaurant manager contacted me and I have removed those specifics from this review. However, it is reflected in the 1 star rating I have given this restaurant.   The food was good, but the service was confrontational. Our server treated us with condescension and rudeness. It was more than just being aloof... every interaction we had was offputting, and we went through the meal without a single smile from her.  Although the food and atmosphere were both good, they could not compensate for the degree of aloofness, rudeness, and unprofessionalism we experienced. I left the restaurant with a VERY sour taste in my mouth, and it was disappointing for a friend's birthday dinner.   I will not be returning again next time I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"The place is tucked in the Ossington strip of restaurants and boutique shops. It's small and cozy, and depending where you sit, it's hard to get up to go to the washroom. Speaking of that, it's in the basement. They kept it modern and clean with one room for each gender. I wasn't a big fan of the wallpaper or the decor. Nothing spoke out Malaysian (fusion) to me.   The entrance could have a better set up for the server/host to greet the customers. Things were placed on two stools.   We were early and were offered water right away. Throughout the dinner, water was refilled without asking. They were informative on the night's special entree and the ingredients that are used in the desserts.   Meals: (1) The lettuce wrap with two (pieces of) soft shell crabs was small and I believe it's not worth $11. There's better deal out there for an app like this at a Japanese place. (2) The red chili wings looked good and it was actually hot in temperature which was nice since you know they just fried them!!! It had a good sauce to it, just a bit tiny on the size of the wings. (3) Char Kway Teow fried rice noodle was not worth it at all. It came with three shrimps, not prawns as the menu stated. I ordered this dish because it was recommended by other Yelpers. It reminds me of a \"pad thai\" or stir-fried noodle at a chinese place. The sauce was bland, but the spicy sauce that came with it was a lot better. They didn't add hardly any veggies, just bean sprouts, so it looked \"blah\". A little bit of red peppers, green peppers and coriander would have made the dish stand out! (4) My friend ordered the Laksa and he said the sauce was great that he took it home, but the quantity was not enough that he felt hungry still. A joke was that we should try the Cubana place next door to fill up our tummies after this experience. (5) Sago sago was for dessert and they were disappointed as they say it wasn't worth the money. My friend said she could make it better!!   Verdict: I felt for a Malaysian type of restaurant, it was over-priced for the quantity and quality of food. The service was appreciated and they always had a smile on their faces! So will I go back, probably not. There's other restaurants on that street that I would love to try."}
{"text":"Had a great evening at Soos.  It's a small family run restaurant but the flavors are anything but small!  We went on a Friday evening and was a busy little place.  Reservations recommended.  We had: 1.  Prawn crackers with homemade sauce.  Nice snack and they gave us extra sauce when asked (it was really tasty) 2.  Pork belly pancakes.  I think the pancakes are made of taro - was crispy and balanced well with the pork belly which was quite salty on its own. 3.  Chili chicken wings - they were awesome.  Had a very nice kick. 4.  Stuffed roti - was ok.   5.  Char Kway Teow - spicy and satisfying with lots of depth of flavors.   The chicken wings and Char Kway Teow noodles were my fave.  The service was very good."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, the first time back in January and the second time just last week and both visits were excellent. Food, service and atmosphere, everything about this place is great.  Malaysian restaurants are very rare in Toronto, another one I could think of is Restauran Malaysia which is up in Richmond Hill. I don't know why there are so few Malaysian restaurants around as the cuisine borrows from various Asian cuisine but served in the most flavourful, multi-dimensioned, and savory way.   Their cocktails are very tasty and captures a lot of great tropical flavours without being overly sweet. I found their tea cocktails the most interesting and very refreshing. Their selections of wines is not huge but nicely selected and reasonably priced.  Some of my favorite dishes include: Chili Wings - flavor packed, mild heat, finger-lickin' good! Reconstructed Nasi Lemak - beautifully presented and a great combination of textures and flavours. Pork Belly Pancakes - a well cooked and cut piece of pork belly that has the perfect balance of meat and fat. The second time I had it I thought it was a little too heavy on the sweet hoisin-like sauce. Char Kway Teow - This is an awesome drunken noodle dish with shrimp and served with some awesome Sambal sauce on the side, which is a very savory and spicy chili sauce made with ground dried shrimp. They also sell jars of this homemade Sambal sauce to take home, which I strongly recommend. I think this is best condiment around, far better than Siracha sauce!  The mango slaw while simple and fresh, seems a little weak compared with the other dishes. It needs a little more dressing and spice, but makes for nice refreshing bite between the more spicy dishes.  My last visit there the waitress was nice enough to offer a sample of their coconut crème caramel dessert with fresh berries for my table on the house. It made for a very nice ending to our meal and I would definitely would order this dessert on my next visit.  The service was excellent. Very friendly and attentive and our water glasses were constantly filled. I have been recommending this place to many of my friends who only thought you had to go to Richmond Hill to have great Malaysian food."}
{"text":"Stopped by the other day for dinner and was by far the best decision of the day. The food, service, and decor was all amazing.  I haven't had great service like that in a long time. My glass was never empty and the girls were on top of everything 5/5 service.  I tried several items from menu and I have to say the coconut rice took me back to my time spent in Kuala Lumpur a few months back. The chef did a wonderful job of keeping the authenticity of the Malaysian dishes.  I would strongly recommend the fried banana with bang bang ice cream. 5/5.  The decor of the place was well done as well. Each table and room had a little different look to them.  I can't wait to go back on there Special Malaysian nights where they cook numerous authentic plates."}
{"text":"Not your typical run-of-the-mill Asian restaurant. From it's soothing ambiance to its delectable dishes, Soos by far is second to none.  The service was stupendous. Water was being filled after basically every sip, plates and utensils were changed after every dish. What more could one ask for?  Soos takes a modern/westernized twist to Malaysian cuisine and the two corresponds to one another beautifully. The decor is a mix of modern lighting and furniture with a unique cultural twist (in the walls, backsplash, and paintings).  You could taste the freshness in every bite. I am new to Yelp but I am happy to say that Soos deserves my first ever review.  Perfect setting for a date, family or friend outings!  Ps: the CKT is life!!!"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  The char kway teow, the roti and the laksa. I didn't try it but I heard it tasted good was the pork belly pancakes, the prosperity tossed slaw and the red chili wings.   It's a rather small restaurant so make sure you make reservations for this restaurant! Specializing in Malaysian street food, I liked the laksa alot. Bursting with curry flavor and it had two different types of noodles along with the ingredients of shrimp, tofu and chicken.  I think the dishes were generally great, but nothing particular that jumped out at me. We ordered an asparagus small dish that wasn't that special (forgot the name of it).  The char kway teow tasted very much like the chinese dish, beef with flat noodles and bean sprouts. The roti is a very good vegan option as the curry is made with lentils. The roti tasted fresh too.  Unfortunately, my guests and I didn't really like our waitress who served us. She made us feel uncomfortable in that she would come interrupt us very rudely and she would rush us to order and get things going when there was no need to since there were some empty tables. We didn't feel like she liked us that much even though we didn't do anything to her.   They have a big table in the back of the restaurant that can cater to bigger groups in a semi private setting so if you have a party, this place might be a good option to host it.  LAST TIP?!  I suggest not ordering the asparagus dish since it is not worth the money. You get three stalks and it's drizzled by a curry sauce that they made. That's it! For the Laksa, there's two sizes  for $18 and $22, and if you have three people, there's a serving size that serves for 3 ppl however it jumps to $33! So I would rather recommend you to get the large serving ($22) and get some other dishes to try rather than get the 3rd serving of the laksa."}
{"text":"Really wanted to enjoy my experience here with the 4 star review but my experience was really lacking.  TLDR; overpriced bland food that I wouldn't consider authentic  Despite the aroma and look of the laksa, it lacked depth of flavour. Still tasty, but it wasn't spicy at all and had no authentic coconut milk flavour coming through.  The most disappointing was the roti - not the actual flatbread - but the curry that came with it. It wasn't legitimate curry, the sauce was drowned in chickpeas and had no flavour or kick. Might as well have been eating hummus with it.  I had actually wanted to try the rendang but $28 is a little hard to justify. I live uptown where there are a lot more Malaysian food options that are cheaper and taste better so I likely won't visit again."}
{"text":"Food  Awesome and interesting. We had 4 dishes. The veggies slaw was my favorite. Crunchy and flavorful. The curry roti was tasty. Their version of pad Thai was  just okay. The chicken taco was perfectly cooked and flavored. Hubby had an old fashioned and he loved it which is rare as he is picky.  They also had a good selection of drinks.  Service Excellent. Cant complain. Family owned as per the newspaper article in the hallway by the washroom. Food arrived quickly and well timed.   Atmosphere Hippie modern vibe. Busy. Festive feel. The washrooms are clean which is rare in family owned asian restaurants.  Price  Well priced.   Highly recommends!"}

{"text":"Food are very yummy. I got char kway teow, it's a little bit spicy and I loved it!! My friend got the pork bell pancake, she told me the meat \" melted\" in her mouth, so good! The service is great! And atmosphere is casual but not too noise! Def recommend!"}
