{"text":"We travel to Arizona 3 times a year to visit family and Nosh Cafe is always a stop we have to make! These are the most flavorful, fresh and tastiest bagels we've ever had! The lattes and freshly squeezed orange juice are such a perfect pairing to our savory breakfast sandwiches! The service is great and we're always so pleased with our stop en route back to California! Can't wait to be back in March!!!"}
{"text":"Sunday mornings are always fun with the hustle and bustle of people hungry for their bagel breakfast. The food is always fast and good!  Come!"}
{"text":"Great little place for breakfast.  Hard to find a place that makes quality food that isn't the standard breakfast fast food.  Nice staff, clean location, would recommend."}
{"text":"I started going here probably a year ago, and it has turned into a 3 to 4 time a week ordeal. Not only do they have delicious bagels and cream cheese (try the chive!), they have a number of other breakfast and lunch items. I have loved everything I have tried so far.  As for the service.... It's excellent. Most of the employees know me by name and are always smiling and happy. It'd be one thing to simply get good food, but it's the best experience I really enjoy.  Even when the boss isn't around, they find the perfect mix of friendly and efficient. Do expect to wait a while on the weekends and busy morning hours, but it's for a good reason.  I highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to enjoy a nice meal in a nice environment."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and had breakfast. The hashbrowns and pancakes were awesome. Can't wait to go back for lunch sometime."}
{"text":"Just ate breakfast with my family.  Environment is positive and comfortable.  Food was great!  Service was friendly and helpful...."}
{"text":"We LOVE The NOSH for both Breakfast AND Lunch. Anytime we have friends or family from out of town return for a visit, they always request that we go to the Nosh during their stay.  The portions are very generous, reasonably priced and taste absolutely wonderful. There are a variety of items on the menu and many times yummy specials of the day.  It's also really nice that they allow us to \"create our own\" by adding or subtracting ingredients. I like the apple/sausage scramble or the turkey club sandwich (its stacked with quality thin sliced turkey).  The staff is always friendly and working hard.  My husband refers to the Nosh as the neighborhood \"Cheers\" because we feel welcomed and we see many repeat customers."}
{"text":"Wow! My experience was not good today for my first time going into The Nosh!! I paid almost 7 dollars for a bagel with strawberry cream cheese and a mocha coffee, which would have been fine if they were good. My bagel had a substance I couldn't identify on it and the cream cheese was more like yogurt. Not pleasant! Then when I was handed my coffee it was leaking all over the place which was very disappointing as it was a TO GO order and most of it ended up all over my car. The first sip I took over 20 mins after ordering burnt my mouth!!! I'm assuming because the girl making my coffee was too busying chatting and had steamed the milk she added to my coffee to the point it overflowed onto the counter. The person she was chatting with was her manager who was standing right there and saw all of this. I can't believe she proceeded to give me this coffee after that. So disappointed I dont know that I'll ever return which is unfortunate because I live so close. Would NOT recommend!!"}
{"text":"Just a quick review.  I've been there countless times.  On my way out to go for a bike ride.  On my way home from a bike ride.  Or in the middle of a ride for a quick respite.  Its always a tasty treat and relaxing experience worth looking forward to.  And no matter when I go, I can always count on great bagels, delicious cream cheeses and great service.  I don't think I've ever had negative experience; this is partially due to the owners, Rob and Darcy (sp?), that seem to really try to make the place as friendly and good as they can make it.  One hint about it, try their new Nosh Bars.  They are a little piece of delectable heaven."}
{"text":"Their bagels are great, but the place is packed on weekend mornings. Service is still quick even when it is busy though."}
{"text":"Great place for a simple bagel and cream cheese or yummy lunch sandwich! Great food!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and the food and service is excellent and friendly.  The lox and bagel are amazing and A LOT of food.  I have also had the pancakes which are great.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast! Love the omelette with chicken sausage and spinach, fresh sour dough bread! Their fresh bagels are good to have them bake a fresh batch to take home."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Sunday was our first time there and we had breakfast.  I ate the French Toast, my wife had the pancakes,Hash Browns and Eggs.  The butter was very good with some flavoring to it.  I'm not sure what it was but we loved it.  Pancakes and French Toast were soft and the hash browns were freshly made to perfection.  Plus they had Kona Coffee!  My toddler even loved the hash browns and pancakes.   I think we found our new Sunday Breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I like the food here...it is gross to watch the girl making the breakfast sandwich without TWO gloves and using the exposed hand (just hoping it's clean. Cross contamination must not be a big deal).the owner seems to have favorite customers. He has a bunch of younger girls working which is fine but as I stood in line I witness what looks like cattiness and 'tude...not towards the customer however. My only recommendation: call in your order, add an extra 5 minutes to their pick up time and you Will be good. Breakfast burrito and pancakes are always a good choice here  ADDITION: we waited for our order to be called (they call by name) they call our name and totally ignore us giving our order to the guys sitting right next to us. When we go and ask if he had just said \"Kevin\" the owner , without even looking up, completely dismisses us \"no I didn't say Kevin\" but then walks over to the guy and says \"are you Kevin?\" He says no and LUCKILY (or else shit would've hit the fan) the dudes order was exactly our order so their screw up was easily fix. Sooo clearly customer service isn't their strong suite"}
{"text":"Happened to be near, so I dropped in about a month ago.  Oh, my word, had the best bagel I've had in such a long time.  I've since had bagels from Chompies (just okay) and NY Bagels&Baily (fairly good).  But I keep thinking about the bagel I had from BagelNosh... it left such an impression on me.  I am even tempted to drive across town just to have another bagel from here.  And, the staff were very nice."}
{"text":"Rob and his wife are  the owners they are great people and the food is great too. It is a local business.  Not a chain. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Love this place! Definitely our go to breakfast stop, love the bagels and the South Mountain Burro is the best!"}
{"text":"This is your go to breakfast/brunch in the Ahwatukee/Tempe area.  They make their own bagels, quite the selection and cheap!  This has got to be the best bang for your buck and good quality ingredients to match.  Everything is great here and wide selection of not only breakfast but lunch.   If this is your first visit I would recommend the Apple Smoked Sausage Scramble (they WILL do egg whites on anything for you).  The Breakfast Burrito or for heartier meals... check out their pancakes and biscuits and gravy.  My favorite bagel:  Cinnamon  Sugar or the Raisin with a bunch of Peanut butter spread on top.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband and tried this place because it is in the same parking lot as our Gym... after a morning class we stopped in for breakfast... let me tell ya, it was great! The place is neat and clean, service was great, staff super helpful for us first timers, and the food was quickly delivered and we'll made. I had a BLT (my favorite thing to judge new places by)... it was awesome! Ron got the breakfast burrito which rocked!! We can't wait to go back and try their lunch!"}
{"text":"Love this place....My wife and I go for the coffee at least once a week. The reason for the non 5 star is the service. There is an army of of employees standing around behind the counter with no sense of urgency or purpose. They need guidance and structure to accomplish so much more than they are. Plus, open up a separate line for drinks only and pick up orders. We waited for 30 min for 2 ice coffees. Passed up twice to ring up pick up orders. This just leaves a bad taste in your mouth of importance and makes a customer think, \"this place ain't that good\"."}
{"text":"Delicious bagels, awesome staff, friendly owner. I loved the special cranberry/citrus cream cheese they had around the holidays last year, I hope it comes back around this year!"}
{"text":"In town on business and was looking for a good breakfast place. Checked out Crackers and Hillside spot on Yelp, yet they didn't open until 7 am.  I decided to try this place and was glad that I did.  Great food with big portions, clean restaurant, and good customer service!  Not sure how long this place has been in service, but you can tell it is a hit with the locals.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great food, service (even when they're super busy), and menu selection!  My family and I tried this place for the first time late Saturday morning. It was very busy with not enough seating.  However, the line moved at a nice pace & we were eventually able to snag a table as soon as some other patrons had left.   Pancakes are huge and delicious. As are their breakfast sandwiches and bagels. The Oriental Chicken salad is delish! Great portion with a lovely amount of chicken on top. The dressing is superb!  The staff is five star! . Polite, friendly, efficient, and very hard-working team!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Great food! We just left today disappointed. The young lady said that they closed the grill early, and that we could not order breakfast. They were also putting up chairs at 1:30! We will be sure to get here earlier next time!"}
{"text":"We followed the previous Yelp reviews to this place on a late Thursday morning. Menu was standard cafe stuff, nothing too fancy, nor too bad. Service was alright - the girl was on her phone taking some call-in orders and we had to wait like 5 minutes before we could order our breakfasts. But then, just as we watched the people after us got served one by one, our food just refused to show up for a good 30 minutes. My patience wore thin at that time and just decided to leave, by when our food was still nowhere to be sighted in the kitchen. Outrageous. Outrageous. Would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place and am kind of shocked that it has as high of reviews as it does. I do not like the cramped tiny space and how it is located in a strip mall. I see that a lot of the good reviews are of the bagels they serve. Hmmm. I didn't think you could screw up bagels. I do not see anything special about this place but it did seem that it catered to locals and wasn't touristy."}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast. Friendly staff and great food. The downfall... Seating. I stay away from this place on weekends because they have out grown their location, usually a line out the door for breakfast. I would give it a 5 star if you could find a seat on weekends. Please expand the location or move to larger one. We would support you:)"}
{"text":"We had the chorizo scramble and sausage/mushroom/cheddar omelet without toast or potatoes - they picked up we were avoiding starches and offered fruit, which was sweet of them! Food was quite tasty. Fast, friendly service. Well priced and bright & welcoming atmosphere. It was our second trip as we enjoyed the first trip so much - we just travel through a few times a year on the way to visit family :)"}
{"text":"If you like Lox bagels then you'll love this place. It puts Einstein bagels to shame."}
{"text":"Here's the deal. The lox works bagel sandwich is off the charts. I have mine double toasted on an everything bagel and it is ridiculous. Perfect amount of salmon, cream cheese, capers, and red onions. Comes open faced,as per every appropriate cultural guideline.   Your breath will smell for days. Worth every bite!"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time, some weeks every morning. The food and service is good, but the customers are horrible. This is a small place and it's one of those places where you have to fight for a table and people will walk in the door, grab a table as fast as they can, and then send someone up to make the order. They have no regard for folks who are literally standing there with food in their hands who've been waiting for a table for 10 plus minutes. This morning for example, there were four tables nabbed by rude customers that just walked in the door as I clearly stood there with my food. Three other tables had people camped out on them who had finished eating before I even walked in. I really don't get any of these people."}
{"text":"So far just had the bagels but they were great.  I like the atmosphere inside the shop, too, and the outside seating."}
{"text":"Ehh. Another location that supposedly has bagels like back east... Not quite. I ate there and that was that. Bagel Man is still the best in the valley. Places like The Nosh cafe are fine as long as they keep some shoppers from  overcrowding The Bagel Man."}
{"text":"I liked this place. The staff was cheerful and friendly. Service was quick. I had the Two x Four (2 eggs, hashbrowns & toast with your choice of bacon, ham or sausage) and my wife had The Cheerful (1 egg, a pancake, hash browns & 1 piece of bacon, ham or sausage). Our food was tasty and cooked exactly as requested, but my wife's pancake was exceptional. I would eat there again."}
{"text":"We had lunch today. We both ordered the Chicken Salad over green salad  I had the Greek dressing. It was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Searched Yelp for best nearby breakfast burrito and ended up at The Nosh. Great burrito and the menu had several other great looking items. Great find when I am in town."}
{"text":"Great bagels, friendly people, quick service, nice modern decor and spectacular drawing on the menu (in the wall). They sweat the little details like the sauce and condiments section all nearly stacked. The girls that work there are all young so they might not be the most refined taking the dishes and trays out of your way but they do smile all the time!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service, I was in a Brunch mood and this is the perfect place for that! My fiancé picked the perfect place to go and the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"Everyone is very friendly. The food is awesome. The bagels are better than most from NYC.  The bacon egg and cheese on a bagel is very good."}
{"text":"definitely have to go back. had the mtn burrito. will stay and eat next time"}
{"text":"Best bagel that I have had so far in Phoenix. I had a simple egg and cheese on An everything bagel and it met my expectations. I went on a Sunday morning and it was chaotic and narrow and hard to get around. That is my only criticism."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and ordered the \"Two x Four\" which came with toast, hash browns, two eggs, and a meat of your choice (ham, bacon, or sausage). It was excellent. The bacon was thick cut (but still crunchy) and had a smoky flavor. The price was very reasonable at $8 for such a large portion. I would love to go back to try their lunch menu. This is the perfect little cafe spot if you are a fan of bagels, sandwiches, and breakfast food in general. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Service was great, everyone was super nice, but the food had zero taste and even made me a bit sick later. I won't go here again"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Bagel Nosh. They learned my name right away and miss me when I don't come in for awhile. They even know what and how I like my bagel! They have the yummiest Mocha Glacier- i'm totally addicted! It's not bitter at all - it's sweet and a lot better than Sbx! They are always busy in the mornings but they keep the line moving - so it's never a problem. You know if cops eat there...it's good and they are there EVERY morning!! The girls are so nice... Now I'm craving a bagel and Mocha Glacier - thanks!  Elaine"}
{"text":"Nice place for quick lunch. I love eating on their patio, once the temps are calm down. We had chef's salad and a breakfast plate which were very good. Good spot fir bagel treat."}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick morning snack, following a long bike ride. They have a good selection of bagels and they taste so fresh. Nothing like a fresh toasted bagel with a nice spongey core on a Saturday morning!"}
{"text":"I have been going to The Nosh for several years and it's always, always a tasty experience. I can't stay away from the Lox and Works because it's amazingly delicious. They must use top quality lox because it's better than anywhere else. The mochas are excellent and I saw the owner making one himself- they use Ghirardelli Chocolate!!! YUM!!! I always recommend The Nosh to family and friends because it's so good. Oh!!! Also, they have a dog friendly patio with water bowls for the puppy patrons."}
{"text":"Great food! Different menu than any other bagel shop I've been to."}
{"text":"Best bagel place in Ahwatukee!! Blows Einstein's away with a huge cannon, bazooka! Support locally owned business, especially when they're miles ahead of the national chains. An example is their bagel and lox. You get a generous bagel with lots of salmon, which is obviously the only reason you'd ever order the lox. To contrast, at Einstein you get a tiny amount of salmon that, honestly, they should be completely embarrassed about serving. The bagels here are incredible too and they offer a nice selection of breakfast and lunch. Oh, and they have great coffee!!!"}
{"text":"Slow line, self serve coffee all out at 1030, chorizo eggs were orange Cat food slop. Staff was nice!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and the reviews looked good as well as the food so we decided to give it a  try. It was very disappointing. My husband got his food first after about a ten minute wait. It took an additional 10 minutes before my little daughter and myself got our food, by which time my husband's food went cold from waiting. My omelet was bland with no seasoning on it. My daughter's nutella crepe was good. My husband ordered the pancake breakfast, and again no salt or pepper even seasoned the eggs. That's a pretty basic cooking flaw. So between the food being so-so and the having to wait for the food to be separately so far apart we were not impressed."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is good and yummy coffee and tea. It's just the long line and inefficient ordering process could use an overhaul. Please, please on busy hours add another order taker or something."}
{"text":"Simple amazing. I have been coming here for years and every meal has been 110%. Fresh food, fantastic service & always consistent!   They offer breakfast from build your own bagel sandwich to omelettes and even pancakes that will melt in your mouth. My favorite is the works bagel with eggs, bacon, Gouda cheese and a slice of tomato.  Lunch selections are healthy, fresh and made to your requests. You will love their options of deli sandwiches (hot & cold), wraps, & salads! Give the southwest sandwich a try and it will define a new meaning to your lunch time.   Cheers to a great family run neighborhood restaurant that exceeds all expectations!"}
{"text":"The food here is incredibly awesome! I ordered the South Mountain Burrito. I can't begin to tell you how delicious it was. My taste buds were in heaven!  I will also say that my biggest pet peeve is having your food arrive cold. NOT the case here. My burrito arrived literally hot off the grill just the way I like it. You gotta come here. I assure you that you will not regret it!! Bring the whole family!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Bagels were just ok. The flavor is pretty good but the texture is way off from what a great bagel should be. They too thin and there is no crisp outer layer. Instead outer layer is tough and difficult to eat makes me think of what eating dry skin would be like.   The real disappointing part of Nosh is that they microwave all their food.  They have three microwaves displayed prominently like its a good thing. Flavorless eggs (probably powdered) microwaved doesn't improve the poor texture of the bagels."}
{"text":"By far one of the best bagels I have ever had! I ordered the egg bagel with lox spread my first time here and had to bring my hubby and boys back the next day it was SOO GOOOD!  Hubby ordered the Lox and Works and said it was good, but that they actually gave too much lox, which is unusual for him. (He figures they are losing money on it and could save if they slimmed down the amount they gave.) I used some of his lox on my garlic bagel but was slightly disappointed that the garlic bagel had too much garlic on it, which, when toasted got burned. I love garlic and would've thought garlic would have been in the bagel also not only only on the top. I do think it's a little on the pricey side, but it's local so will support it. All in all, I know I'll go again since it's close to my work and may have to give the glacier a try since others have raved about it."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast place in Ahwatukee!  I had the lox, and it was really good lox - as fresh as salmon in the desert gets.  The sweet habanero cream cheese was delicious, too, and I haven't seen that anywhere else.  There are about 10 things I want to try on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Have dropped by here on the way to work a couple of times now.  Staff is super friendly and quick.  Bagels are soft and chewy. I am a super fan of the Nosh Veggie on sesame.  Hoping to have the time to get to sit and have breakfast their soon and try some of the yummy food I have seen."}
{"text":"Took some out of town business guests Food was good and fresh Ordered breakfast burritos and omelet  Everyone thought it was great and especially raved about coffee too Order at counter and they bring to your table"}
{"text":"Small, claustrophobic inside. Went on a Saturday morning and it was SO hot inside it was uncomfortable. It's the summer people. Keep the air down. Food is mediocre. Probably wouldn't recommend or return"}
{"text":"The food is usually very good with good prices. Normally I would give this place a 4 or 5 star review, but today the service and food were pretty bad. The food was overcooked to the point it was not edible and half of the staff was screwing around flirting with a guy they call marky mark. The owner if he was there would not have been happy. It's too bad that you can't leave your restaurant and know that the staff will take care of it. He needs cameras to watch the staff in his absence."}
{"text":"Very disappointing! There are much better places to go for bagels and breakfast stuff.The service is lacking both in efficiency and friendliness. Actually the girl behind the counter was rude and discourteous. The food was just ok nothing special The best thing about eating there is I don't ever have to eat there again Can't imagine they'll be in business for long Yuk :("}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat breakfast! I love the wonderful they serve. And the French roast coffee is to die for!! It's always busy with guests coming and going, but I never have to wait too long for my food! It's never wrong and I am never ever disappointed. I'm so glad my fiancé had me try this place out, I do not regret it! It's a short distance away and it's something we don't eat often, so it never gets old!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, mellow atmosphere and ok food  I got an iced mocha that was delicious and the breakfast sandwich that was ok. Tasted lol velveeta cheese eggs and sausage."}
{"text":"Here on a Saturday morning about 10:45 am:  This place is uncomfortably hot. 7-10 bucks a plate. Our server brought the food over and when asked for silverware, instead of kindly bringing some, directs us to the fountain drinks area. Exuding a \"whatever\" attitude. Flys everywhere. Forks were dirty. The entire staff was sweating.. no theme to eating area and very cluttered. Lots of people here, though. Food was subpar - IHOP-like."}
{"text":"I had never been here before the remodel so I'm not sure how much has changed, but I really dig the place currently.  It has a very nice contemporary feel and a very complete breakfast menu for being such a small place.  The few times I have been here they have been pretty packed and it can get a bit iffy as you wait for your to go order.  You seem to be in the way no matter where you go.  Aside from that the bagels are delicious, the breakfast burritos are really great and they have excellent OJ.  What more can you want from a breakfast place?  I tried the pancakes which were really good. As is normal for the area they are way bigger than any standard human needs.  They come in three, two, or one.  I went for two, next time it will just be a single.  If you decide to get the three stack bring some hungry friends.  Try: - Pancakes - Breakfast Burrito - Bagels"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick breakfast bagel and coffee to go after staying at a hotel across the street. The standard breakfast bagel with bacon was super delicious and super filling! Definitely worth coming back to!"}
{"text":"Yikes. This place needs better organization with their staff. I called ahead my order but still had to stand in the long line.  I even asked several hostesses what I should do but I wasn't helped. 20 minutes in line before I finally got to the cash register to pick up my to go order. Even though the girl wrote down the order correctly on the ticket (chorizo scramble) I got a chorizo burro--so I end up paying a dollar extra for an item that's cheaper and not what I ordered.  The food is pretty good itself but pretty basic....definitely not worth the wait and the stress of ordering and getting incorrect items. My experience was very stressful. They have about 6 girls working there all seeming confused and running around in every which way getting things mixed up. I may go back to pick up just bagels but nothing else that requires much effort on their end."}
{"text":"It's not necessarily bad.. but for the price, it was not good. I particularly didn't like that the syrup for my french toast came in a plastic container. That doesn't feel homey or comforting and it's an easy switch to a container that is reusable and better for the earth"}
{"text":"The texture of the bagels is that of a kaiser roll, but their lox cream cheese spread is amazing. The latté is okay, but then again I'm a bit of an espresso snob. I would come back just to buy their cream cheese."}
{"text":"After repeatedly going to a few of the same breakfast / brunch places, we figured we would try somewhere new! The Nosh Cafe came up in our Yelp search, so we went at around 11am on Saturday. There was only a short line in the front where they take orders, and I'm not sure how busy the cafe usually gets, but we were able to snag an empty table right away after ordering.   I got a create your own sandwich: toasted jalapeño cheese bagel with veggie cream cheese, turkey, tomatoes, sprouts, red onions, and cucumbers. The sandwich came with either a bag of chips, potato salad, or pasta salad; I chose the potato salad. My fiancé ordered the Mediterranean Omelet which had olives, onions, tomatoes, artichokes, spinach, & feta cheese. It came with a side of hash browns.  The first thing we noticed when our order was brought out to us is how large the portions were! The bagel sandwich had a ton of turkey on it along with very thinly sliced veggies. I thought it was good, however it didn't have any unique flavors that I haven't been able to get in the same type of sandwich elsewhere. I did consider when I initially ordered that their non-custom-made sandwiches would maybe be more unique, so I'd be willing to come back to try one of those.  The Mediterranean omelet, similar to the sandwich, was stuffed with a ton of toppings as well. My fiancé really liked it and was happy that they didn't skimp on anything, but he did say that the hash browns were just okay. We were not certain if they offer another side with the omelet but if we returned, he would definitely ask about it.  Overall, we had a good experience! Unfortunately, I can't see myself driving out of my way to come here, however it would be somewhere I would consider stopping by if I were already in the area."}
{"text":"YUM.  I popped in here for a quick breakfast sandwich, and it was incredibly good & affordable.  Hoping to return to try some of the other food items, but that toasted cheese bagel with ham, cheese, and egg was delicious."}
{"text":"BEST PANCAKES!!! We want the recipe. They're newly remodeled and better than ever. Always great bagels but now they have added more menu items, more choices. Great food, great people!"}
{"text":"This was seriously one of my most favorite breakfast spots ever!  I ordered a breakfast sandwich and Nutella crepes with bananas and they were phenomena (huge plates, I shouldn't have ordered both; no regrets) l!!! The coffee lacked the strength I wanted, but it was okay.  The interior was clean, welcoming, and well directed.   I highly recommend."}
{"text":"So disappointed today. This is one of the few places I can get a decent (not great) bagel and lox in AZ. Went for lunch with my husband and we each ordered. I specifically asked for my garlic bagel (the last one) to be lightly toasted since I hate burned anything. My husband got a sandwich on a Works bagel and an iced coffee. Everything took way longer than it should have for only a few customers and that nothing we ordered required any cooking. My husband's coffee tasted more like vanilla syrup than anything else, his sandwich was on a sesame seed bagel not the Works like he ordered, and my garlic bagel was burnt black on the top. When I told one of the girls she offered me a free bagel or to remake our meals. We didn't have another 15 minutes to wait for them to remake our meals as slowly as they made them. Sorry when I pay, I expect to get what I ordered and 3 errors on a single order is staff being lazy and clearly not valuing customers time or money.   Additionally the guy sitting next to us who had ordered long before us had to ask for his food. I'm not sure what was going on but I think I saw 4 employees so I'm confused what anyone was doing."}
{"text":"Enjoying a South Mountain burro quite thoroughly! First time trying this and would recommend it. The Bagel Breakfast (bagel sandwich) is my usual go to breakfast, and it is awesome. Bagels are literally minutes from the oven (made on site). Everything is fresh....I'm gushing on I know. I've lived in this neighborhood for 30 years and have been a customer since they opened I don't know how long ago. The staff are great, energetic young people and the owners work right along side them. A couple of the staff know me by name. (I've worked retail and know how hard it is to remember peoples names. It's part of the attraction to this neighborhood right-around-the-corner  restauran"}
{"text":"Kids running the place. Credit card machine goes down on a Saturday morning and the place goes down the tubes. Horrible experience twice in a row and food is just so-so. We won't be back."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE 30+ MINUES TO SPARE. Let me start off by saying I usually never write bad reviews and tend to just brush a bad experience off or give them the benefit of the doubt. However this experience actually affected me beyond just my order. This was my first time at Nosh cafe and my last. I had work at 10 a.m and so I woke up early in order to get coffee and breakfast. After I left Starbucks in the bashas next door, I went to Nosh Cafe to try something new at 9:30. I figured I had 20 minutes to spare and since it was a breakfast place I figured they could get a simple to go order of a simple bagel with spread in under 20 minutes. I was very wrong. 20 minutes pass by and still no bagel and several people who ordered before me were still waiting for their bagel so I had to call my manager and let them know I had already paid for my food and could not just leave and that I would be a little late. Thankfully my manager is very understanding and told me not to worry about being late. After I got off the phone, at 9:55 they decide to tell me they don't have the bagel to complete my order. I was in disbelief because they had not started my order even though it had been 25 minutes. I told them I was already late for work and to just give me my money back or give me a different bagel in 30 seconds so I could leave. They were able to get that bagel out in record time surprisingly. I will not be coming back it was very slow service and not to mention the food was not worth that wait or being late for work."}
{"text":"There are not many places in the Valley you can find a salt bagel and they have awesome salt bagels, just don't get there too late you won't get one.  The staff is always friendly and when my friends and I come back from our bike rides they always get our food to us quickly."}
{"text":"First time at Nosh. Quite the line at 11am on Sunday, but it moved quickly and the girls behind the counter were efficient and polite. We had the chorizo burro, the morning beer, and a jalapeño cheddar bagel with veggie cream cheese. They were out of the works bagel, which is why I chose jalapeño. While we were waiting on our good, the young man came outside and said they were out of chibatta, so I had to choose something else for my sandwich. I chose sourdough, and my sandwich was decent. Just lacked wow factor. Chorizo burrito was also ok. Bagel was excellent, as was the veggie cream cheese. Would definitely gone back for bagels and cream cheese!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I use to live in Awahtukee and now living over 4 hours away I miss the Nosh. I havent had it in over 7-8 years back when it was called Bagel nosh. Its grown and they have a bigger menu. Still love it."}
{"text":"I am from New York, I have high expectations when it comes to bagels- especially breakfast bagel sandwiches.  By FAR- I have one of the best bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel at this cafe. It's clean, quaint and overall adorable.   I also had their creme brulee flavored coffee and fresh orange juice to round out my breakfast and I was not disappointed.  The next day I went back to get the \"Go Bananas\" bagel sandwich which was bananas, PB and agave nectar- also, incredible.   Even though I was in town just a few days for work, whenever I am in Phoenix, I will make sure to stop by this gem an maybe try the pancakes or french toast :)."}
{"text":"The price list rating here needs to be adjusted, 8 dollars for two eggs and toast with a few hash browns is not one $ it's two$$, if you get a drink it's will over ten for not much food and the taste was mediocre IHOP definitely better"}
{"text":"Fantastic Bagels Went to this place based on Yelp reviews and it was a hit. Loved it.  Bagels were amazing; seating area outside was great; atmosphere was great. Will definitively return."}
{"text":"The Nosh is the spot .. Great people , Great service and great food . I've been coming here for over  3 yrs and  every time the experience is AWESOME . Everything is wonderful . Bagels , Salads , Soups etc . If you get a chance please try the Southwest Corn Chowder . Awesome !!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good, the staff was great.  Three star because no A/C. The place isn't very big so I  wouldn't go if you have a big party.  You order at the counter, then they will bring your food to you.  Over all is the AC was working I would go back but because of that I will move on to a new place. But would send husband to get take out."}
{"text":"Been here many times and never disappointed. French toadt is awesome! They also make great omelettes and bagel sandwiches. Not a huge staff so you will wait a little while but its worth it. I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and nice big portions. We ordered everything from breakfast sandwiches to omelets to pancakes and French toast. The iced coffee was delicious as well. They did mess up our order (forgot one of the entrees, and even they did bring the pancakes they forgot the eggs/bacon) but they made it up by sending us home with some bagels and cream cheese. Pretty sure we will be back! Only downside is the seating is limited."}
{"text":"Great little local breakfast/lunch place. We ordered steak and cheese sandwich, club sandwich, jalapeño bagel with cream cheese, and chicken Caesar wrap, peanut butter protein shake. All of it was pretty good. Decent size portions for the price.   We ends up having leftovers.   Place could use a POS terminal for cashier in order to make the ordering process a little smoother.   We will be back! Nice job!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a truly awful experience here today, and won't be returning. Left feedback via square and the owner completely flipped out and sent back a wildly unprofessional response. While the food here is good (usually) the 30+ minute wait time is just unacceptable. I let them know in my feedback that I was dissappointed we waited more than 25min to receive a bagel and french toast, and after saying how everyone works their asses off and that I'm a terrible person for even being upset, their response was that we should have asked where our food was... Okay? Why should I have to ask where my order is, you should be organized and efficient enough to get orders out in a timely manner. To top it all off, they originally gave is a single slice of bread as the $6 french toast we ordered. I could buy a whole loaf of bread and a dozen eggs for cheaper. Plus, it had been sitting in the window so long the butter they put on the side was completely melted and saturated the bread to the point where it was spongy and far too rich to be enjoyable.  Just BEWARE you will be waiting a very long time if you go to the NOSH and only some of the food is worth it. Oh and if you try to give feedback someone will respond with wild and unprofessional accusations rather than try and see what they can do it make it right."}
{"text":"I love The Nosh!  Has been a staple here in Ahwatukee for a while now.  I believe it has changed owners a few times since it first opened, but the current owners are doing a great job!  Very friendly, welcoming staff.  I went there today, just after the morning rush and they seemed very genuine in saying hello and wishing me a great day.  I love the coffee and I love that coffee at these family owned places is usually better than the chain places and also less expensive.  Score!  They have a great selection of bagels and cream cheese, breakfast and lunch sandwiches.  My favorite sandwich is the Nosh Veggie!  Stacked with fresh veggies that really make the bagel sandwich quite refreshing.  Depending on my mood I may get it on a Jalapeno Cheese bagel, or Wheat, or Sesame, or, well, you get the point.  The best part is getting the Garlic Feta Dill cream cheese with all those veggies!  My mouth is watering right now!!  Tons of bicycle folks hanging out on a Saturday morning and a common place for police officers on the weekdays.  Great little spot in the tuke for a casual, quick breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"i'm starving, so i'm going to write a review for the place i'd like to go to lunch to today.  they have the most delicious bagel sandwiches anywhere! i think it has something to do with my new obsession with mustard - here you have three choices, which they apply liberally .  There never seems to be anyone in line (except in the morning hours) so i can order and sit down or be back at the office in no time. they have booths, tables and outside patio tables.   $7 for sandwich, chips and a drink, and it kicks subway or sub factory's ass.   damn i'm hungry."}
{"text":"Nosh hits the spot!  My family and I stopped here for a game time decision, and oh my Nosh they didn't disappoint me.  We Had a great breakfast, I got the 2x4 because I was in a traditional breakfast kinda mood, while my wife got the burrito (#great) and my son with the p-cakes.  This place is tasty food without the extra $20 added to the bill.   We Will for sure be popping in here again!"}
{"text":"Food was alright. My disappointment was the corned beef hash. It basically tasted like strips of pot roast with potatoes. Not quite what I think it should be. I may come back again. The coffee was good."}
{"text":"Very nice and friendly little joint. Offers a nice variety of breakfast. My son ordered 2 pancakes and he was only able to eat 1, they are pretty big and delicious !!  Our breakfast plates were very nicely loaded too. We enjoyed it very much and weren't hungry for lunch at all after that. Try it out, it's worth it."}
{"text":"My family frequently visits this place for their jalapeno cheddar bagels and jalapeno cream cheese. The bagels are very tasty and the cream cheese is even tastier. The prices are very affordable and the service has always been exceptional. During my most recent visit, I had a single cheddar bagel with jalapeno spread and my fiance had the breakfast bagel. My only complaint about mine was that the bagel wasn't very toasted, but they were very generous with the spread. My fiance's bagel had a very thick layer of bacon on it (which he really liked), and his seemed like a very good deal considering all of the meat he was given! The glaciers and the chai lattes are reasonably priced in comparison to the high price these are at the more popular coffee chains. Overall, this is definitely a great stop to grab some breakfast or brunch in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"We just happened to be going to play golf at a nearby golf course. We were early and needed breakfast. What a lucky stop for us! The breakfast menu was pretty big. I had the apple chicken sausage scramble. It was delicious! My friend had a bagel breakfast sandwich. Also yummy. Delicious coffee. Friendly staff.  Good prices. It is a order at the counter and they bring your food to your table kind of place. There are several tables inside and a few outside. Their lunch menu looked good, but I can only rate breakfast. It is not too far off of I-10. I will go back the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"The Nosh is as good as it gets. Although it closes at 2pm daily and the bad customer service, the bagel sandwiches are extremely good! Nosh, is also one of the few joints that still carries spouts. Which i love!"}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to places for weekend breakfast. We always get the same thing even though the menu has changed a lot over the years. There are now a lot of options for hot breakfast but we come here for the delicious bagels. We always share a bagel breakfast sandwich and a banana nut bagel. The bagels are crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle just the way I love them."}
{"text":"First visit, 5 customers ahead of me and had to wait 35 min for food after ordering.    Second visit, ordered take out.  Was told it would be ready in 15 min.  Had to wait an additional 10-15 min after getting there.  No other customers at this time...  Tempting to put 3 stars, but the food is great for a small bakery/cafe. Just expect a longer wait than you'd think.  Maybe order some coffee while you wait lol."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, atmosphere is cute & tidy, and the restaurant includes a lot of outdoor patio seating. 4 stars instead of 5 because service is a little slow and they confused our order. But overall well worth the visit! I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I just discovered this GEM a few weeks ago...DELICIOUS food! Great service! This is my new breakfast spot! I've already taken some friends here that didn't know it existed."}
{"text":"Had the best breakfast here. Had the breakfast grilled cheese which was the best I have ever had of sourdough with cheese, egg and sausage all chopped up together. This is a must have and bug enough for two if not very hungry. Portions are big and prices surprising low..."}
{"text":"I was recommended by a friend and this is hands down one of the best breakfast spot in the area. The staffs are amazingly friendly. The food are yummy and did I mention the portion was HUGE? Their chai latte is on point too! Simply good food with chill environment for breakfast. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for a few years now, always good, always friendly and always delicious food. The Chorizo Burro is outstanding, you gotta try that, get extra cheese and potatoes on it. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast. Specially if you are looking for eggs you should come here. I am not a fan of their coffee though.  I think they should work on the coffee and cappuccino."}
{"text":"Love this place, something new and delicious every time we come. Today was the southwestern on tomato basil, mm-mm-mmmm."}
{"text":"So finally decided to stop by the Nosh since I drive by it everyday. Walking in I am interested since of course they carry Cartel coffee (amazing) and make their own bagels fresh everyday. Hours are understandable since this is like a bfast brunch place for me. I ordered the Bagel bfast sandwich. It was a great sandwich which I loved. There are many menu items to choose from but beware the bagels go fast. Sooo... anywho. The Grandpa ordered a salad which I must say he loved. He said the greens were fresh along with the other veggies. By far his fav salad. So that is good. I would definitely come back to this place. And I recommend for you to try. The price is reasonable for the portions."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for lunch and catching up.  The service was patient and friendly. Atmosphere was good, but nothing special. They were accommodating of my friends daughters request to have everything on a separate plate. My Mediterranean omelette was tasty and enjoyed the fresh fruit over hash brown option."}
{"text":"First let me say that I am a bagel snob.  Being Jewish and having spent most of my life in NY NY, I literally grew up and lived on the Real Thing - bagels and authentic Jewish Deli food.  Given this life long exposure I feel I can confidently say there really is NOTHING special about this place.  Bagels yes.  Better than nothing YES!  Anything remotely close to what I know is possible... No!"}
{"text":"We got here aroun 10am starving . This is a late breakfast for us.  Noticed that the line was out the door.  I was ready to turn around and leave, but I  am so glad we stayed. Your in line for about 5 minutes then you get to place your order. Nice menu with lots of choices. You can add or change what you want which is a plus (bagel instead of toast). The food came about 10 minutes later and OMG it was wondrful.!!!!!!!. Let's start with the coffee, best I  have had in a long time.  My apple chicken sausage scramble melted in my mouth.  My husband's omlett was so perfect .would we go back. How about tomorrow"}
{"text":"The only surprise was that this is not a \"traditional restaurant\" (and we did not see any indication otherwise on these reviews?) - in that you order at the counter, and then they bring the food to you.  They use large \"air-pots\" for their coffee, and if it's not full, the coffee is lukewarm.  The new pot was not only hot, but very tasty.  The bacon was a little under cooked.  The pancakes are quite large, but nothing special."}
{"text":"I just happened upon this place on our way to ikea and we're pleasantly surprised! We came for lunch right before it closed so there weren't many people the workers were extremely friendly and they seem to get along well. Since they were about to close they did not have the bagel I originally wanted but I tried the blueberry with plain cream cheese, most bagels taste the same but I think that the flavor was much better than most. We also had the tombstone wrap with a spinach wrap, it was a little spicy but not overpowering. There was a lot of bacon, which isn't my favorite, but if you like bacon then this sandwich is for you! I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"I am surprised by the good reviews.  I went as a last minute lunch and got a veggie bagel sandwich with fruit and a pickle spear.  It was about $5.50 with tax and I left still hungry.  The bagel was just okay.  The fruit was very fresh and that was a plus.  I have had much better bagel sandwiches.  I miss Brueggers in Chandler."}
{"text":"Called in our bagel order ahead so we could get fresh bagels. Was told to pick up in 25 minutes. Only to arrive and nothing was ready. Our order list was still on the counter and never made. Meanwhile the bagels we ordered were sold out. Waited another 15 minutes for our new food order to be ready. Unbelievable! Worst customer service ever!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. Nice size helpings. The eggs were cooked right and the bacon was crispy! We had a slice of blueberry coffee cake that was made right there by their pastry chef! Staff is very friendly. Everyone works hard, you can tell. Good choice for a birthday breakfast."}
{"text":"Love Bagel Nosh! The staff is so friendly and of course the food is delicious! I have to admit that the pumpkin latte was no Starbucks pumpkin latte, but the pumpkin cream cheese was amazing! ( I do realize it's no longer pumpkin season, I was just wishing I had some anyway) It can get busy on the weekend mornings, esp since the bike shop opened up next door, but I find it well worth the wait! (Oh, and fyi it closes at 2:30 - so get your coffee early!)"}
{"text":"First time here! Brought my mom who's visiting from Cali! We loved it!! The portions were so big! Leftover eggs and ham for lunch yay!!! The employees were very nice. Quick service. Good food. I loved it. I live really close so I'll definitely be coming back :)   I got the pancake breakfast plate, my mom got the inlet with sausage and county gravy (maybe called country inlets- can't remember exactly lol) I got coffee, her tea- $23 for both!!!"}
{"text":"Shared the tombstone wrap and grilled turkey club. Both were amazing! And the service was great, too. Can't wait to go back and try the breakfast options. I was surprised by the variety of the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped by Bagel Nosh on a late Thursday morning to grab some quick coffee and a bagel. As we waited to order, the middle-aged woman donning a hat at the register proceeded to complain to the customers in front of us about how busy it was, comparing the business to that of a Saturday, and whining, \"I don't work on Saturdays!\" Her attitude continued to prove unpleasant and unwelcoming. Although there aren't many breakfast joints in the area, the mediocre bagels and coffee are not worth the poor customer service."}
{"text":"I have been getting my to go breakfasts at The Nosh Cafe for over 7 years and I will not deny that the food is fantastic.  This is the reason I continue  to come back. But what I do not like about this establishment is the customer service, especially that of the owner. The counter staff is mediocre at best, they never make eye contact and smile when you approach the counter. They do not say \"good morning\" or \"how are you today?\", and I almost always have to repeat my order 2 to 3x before they get it right. It is amazing what a simple smile and acknowledgement will do for a customer in terms of satisfaction.  But unfortunately I don't feel it is their fault, because it all trickles down from the owner. In ALL of the years I have entered this establishment she has not once looked at me, smiled, or acknowledged my existence in any manner, even when she has handed me my food directly. She runs around with her head down, without any smile or look of joy in her eye, and she constantly interacting with her staff in a manner that is not very pleasant. I understand she is working hard and has many responsibilities as the owner, but as a business owner myself I know the importance of customer service and positive interactions with employees.  Anyhow, like I said, food is great, this is what keeps me coming back. But if quality of food were to slip,  I would not return due to customer service.  Just my opinion...for what it's worth."}
{"text":"We get breakfast here at least once a month. Consistently good. We usually order the South Mountain Burrito, Lox with Works, and whatever the one is with the banana and peanut butter!"}
{"text":"Once again the freshest best tasting bagels in Tukee!  We ordered the Granddaddy's BELT ( full disclosure, I always order this, it's my favorite) The Bagel sandwich, 2 plain bagels and a cinnamon roll. Everything was top notch.  The sandwiches and bagels are bigger and less expensive here than other bagel shops in our area.   Thanks Nosh!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are always looking for good breakfast places. We heard about this place from a friend who lives almost 20 miles away but always stops by when he is in the area, so thought it must be good.  We came in and were greated by a friendly staff. Food came out fast and was delicious. The atmosphere is relaxed and the coffee is really good. I think we found our new breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Went here today 3/30/18 and was skipped in line for help by the girl in glasses today not once but twice. I said \" Hi I havnt ordered yet and she said oh she'll (the cashier) will get you next. The $3.07 bagel was small and just fluff and comes with 2oz cream cheese on the side which is not enough to cover both bagels but a very thin layer. I use to come here every now and then but this place is officially off my list. The Bagel Man on 50th St. Elliot is 100× better in terms of strictly food as it is not a sit down place. Dont take my word for it go give it a try and then you make your own reviews. You get a New York style bagel that weighs twice as much and comes with over twice as much cream cheese on the side. Think its a quarter pound. I usually dont like to give businesses negative reviews but \"The Nosh\" really needs some constructive criticisms."}
{"text":"Always been curious about the nosh and when we finally stopped in, we were stuck with flavorless food. Eh. I wasn't pleased but people watching while we sat outside to eat was very well worth it. Bunch of crazy table stealers. Ha. No need to return since one visit was enough for us."}
{"text":"This place is great!  The bagel lunch sandwiches are awesome.  I also highly recommend the crepes as they are amazing as well.  Owner is awesome!  I work for Southwest Airlines and love when we have The Nosh cater for any of our events because the food tastes great!"}
{"text":"Went here for a breakfast. They have a good choice of bagels. The staff are courteous and give you good options to choose. The bagels might be little  costly compared to other places here . But the taste was good. I liked the  panini capresse sandwich. It was at right level of crunchiness and good amount tomatoes and basil leaves paste. It was priced at $8."}
{"text":"Nosh used to be my favorite breakfast and it is right around the corner from my house which made it easy. However, Nosh has gone downhill! The service is terrible. It took 30 minutes to get 2 bagels toasted with cream cheese. I always ask for light amount of cream cheese and they continue to add too much. I mean enough to cover 3 bagels! If they do that well, then they forget something else. The bagels are always cold. The quality of the taste of the bagels Is no longer as good as it used to be. They need to bring up their service and quality in order for me to go back.  Update as of 8/14, Service is incredibly slow--slower than before. The girls that work there don't know what they are doing it seems. They have messed up more order now 2Xs. I can no longer come back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Place is friendly, menu on wall a little hard to navigate through but nothing to worry about. Service is very fast and coffee tasty. Once I tried my food I was very pleased. I had the Apple smoked chicken sausage scramble and it was really good. One thing I'd like to point is the table, it was a bit dirty. But good over all. Will definitely return since we don't have places like this in Maricopa."}
{"text":"This place has the best food in town. Huge sandwiches with the tastiest bacon. Super friendly and chill place to hang out. I can't wait to try the whole menu."}
{"text":"This place is ok. I've only ever tried breakfast bagel sandwiches. The bagels are good. Eggs have no flavor, not even salt and pepper. Customer service could be way better. Outdoor seating is a bonus."}
{"text":"If you stop by you got to try the jalapeño cheese bagels. Soooooo good! Recently just tried the south mountain burrito which was incredibly delicious! It's a great place to simply grab a quick breakfast or even sit for a nice brunch!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Breakfast sandwich, see pic, is rubber eggs, with raw.ham slapped on top, with a piece of.cheese slapped on, then a barely.warm (asked for.toasted) bagel. Ive never given a review anywhere but was THAT dissapointed in sandwich, had to. Iced tea was good i suppose  Appended: talked to owner, really nice guy, if you want a breakfast sandwich and arent inna hurry, MAKE SURE TO ASK FOR GRILLED SANDWICH, otherwise they do the quick microwave job.    Owner is worth giving a second chance"}
{"text":"I order a toasted onion bagel w/egg and American cheese and a vanilla iced latte. It's super scrumptious! I will definitely be coming back. Reminded me of NYC and NJ bagel shops, very close quality. Good service too. The only cons are that it's super small inside, and I find it a little pricey... $8.13 was my total. Though it won't stop me from coming back again! Yum :)"}
{"text":"Rob & Darcy have done an amazing job on the remodel and transforming the cafe into more than just bagels and cream cheese. They have really good coffee as well! The staff, for the most part, is friendly and helpful.   Free wi-fi is a plus! :)"}
{"text":"HOLY GREEN CHILI BURRITO GOODNESS!!!!  Ok, I may have never found this place but Donna wanted to try it out. I wasn't really hungry so I just ordered the oatmeal which is good...   Donna ordered the Green Chili Burrito of goodness! We had to share that burrito because it was SOOOO GOOOOD!!! The sauce covering it was some kind of amazing unknown deliciousness that we have since been back several times for.   At this point that burrito is so good, I can not see myself eating anything else here at all in fear of missing out on the awesomeness of this meal!!!  Stop by and for the sake of goodness eat this burrito!"}
{"text":"Yummy bagel sandwiches for lunch. I had the BLT and was pleasantly surprised to have plenty of perfectly done bacon on my sandwich. Flavor was great. My husband got southwestern bagel sandwich and it had a great flavored spread and also tons of meat. It took about 8-10 min to have our sandwiches prepared so I wouldn't recommend if you're in a hurry. I'm not sure if it always takes this long."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast last weekend. My experience here was not good. I got a breakfast bagel that didn't seem to be baked completely. Doughy inside. I asked for it to be toasted and it was not. An irregular amount of fake egg product used in the sandwich. So much I had to take it off. In the end I only ate the rest of the meat and left the egg stuff and bagel. All in all the sandwich was bland. Almost no flavor.   To top it off the Latte I ordered wasn't hazelnut. When I went back I learned the ran out. Huh, could have told me. I'm not sure what flavor the gave me but it wasn't hazelnut.  I gave a two because my wife wasn't disappointed in her meal. Just a bagel and cream cheese."}
{"text":"Here me out before you agree or disagree! The food and service here is great... Actually for the price it was really good! I am 10 year 3 time Iraqi veteran, my wife and I have vowed not to support businesses that do not support military, this place does not give military discount! :-( so sad!"}
{"text":"Five of us went there for breakfast. All of our dishes were great, prices were right. the only thing I would do different next time is pay more attention to the tip. You go up to the counter and order so service is minimal and when they flip the screen it automatically says 15 or 20%. I don't think either is appropriate when you serve yourself. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is the worst lox works i ever had!!!!! The bagel Man 10 times better!!!! And less money. I dont mind paying but this plase is a rip off!!! I wish i could give it a negative stsrs becaouse i would!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting on a Saturday at 11 ish for some brunch. It was busy as to be expected. Wait time for food wasn't bad considering. Staff was friendly. I got the lox and works and my husband got the chorizo burrito. The burrito wasn't bad. My husband said he didn't like that it was meat heavy compared to the other ingredients in it. He also didn't feel the burro was worth $7 of food. I was very disappointed with my lox and works. There was a very small amount of salmon and it was covered in cream cheese. All I could taste was cream cheese with a hint of caper and tomato between a bagel. It was way too cream cheese heavy. I was scraping off what I could, trying not to lose capers. The taste was just unbalanced. It needed more salmon and less cream cheese. Not worth the $9. Maybe we came at a bad day? Maybe we ordered the wrong things? But this is what we like. I guess we just have a different taste with what we ordered. We will probably not be back as there are a couple places closer that have the same burrito and lox and works for a cheaper price and it's done the way we like it. There was nothing else that interested me on the menu, otherwise I'd give it another try. It ended up being too similar to the downtown Chandler cafe...just not as good."}
{"text":"Obsessed!!!   I love the fact that this is a neighborhood coffee bar and restaurant that has everything you need to fulfill your tummy.  Food:  I get a bagel sandwich with bacon egg and cheese on everything bagel with chive cream cheese, melts in your mout!! The bagel is doughy but yet has a firm texture on the outside reminds me of an authentic New York bagel.  My kids love the breakfast grilled cheese with sausage egg and cheese. It's extremely cheesy yet the bread is perfectly toasted. Think of a panini and grilled cheese met at breakfast and had a baby.  Lastly let's talk about the coffee!!! Perfectly balanced, aromatic notes and strength. For a coffee drinker like myself who prefers my coffee just black straight up it as the perfect flavor.   I'm excited to come here for lunch and when I come back for breakfast I must try the pancakes all in all this is our new favorite spot."}
{"text":"YUM! They have incredible food and it's without a server (order at a register, delivered to your table) so the prices are incredible  I got an egg scramble and it was one of the best I've had"}
{"text":"My standards are pretty low while extremely hung over wearing the same clothes I participated in crazy drunken debauchery the night before. But I still left Bagel Nosh feeling like I wished I had gone to IHOP next door.  I ordered the $7 Arizona Classic: an egg sandwich with bacon and cheese on the bagel of my choice. The quality was pretty much on par with a McBagel McSandwich but was twice the price. The bacon was more like bacon bits and the egg was thin and tasteless. There was nothing wrong with the service, but the prices were way too high for what I was eating.  My friends had ordered a bagel with spread that looked better. So I guess the rule of thumb here would be to order a bagel only. I would definitely leave other breakfast food concoctions to another restaurant."}
{"text":"I've heard way good stuff about this place for a while and finally had the pleasure of sitting down and having some lunch there.  Thoughts: Staff was friendly and quick, nice place, very clean and some hi-tops and lots of tables and outdoor seating as well.  Chicken salad bagel sandwich wasn't too bad at all, except for the nuts in it - I'd probably eat it again however.  Had a tomato basil bagel toasted with it... yum!  I'm wanting to go back to try different menu items now :)"}
{"text":"The food was eh. I had the French toast. It was dry and not that great. My husband had the oatmeal. Nothing special-his words."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, fast and friendly.  The bagel breakfast sandwich is a favorite of mine.  It is prepared when you order.  fast fresh table delivery.  Mona Mac coffee is excellent.  The owners are great and always working hard.  Pretty extensive menu."}
{"text":"Sunday breakfast = pancake was in my mind and pancake here is one of better one I had. Fluffy and soft yet has that chewing texture. Their pancake is huge! (See my pics I posted).   Also ordered South Mountain Burro as this name was mentioned several times in reviews. While it doesn't look exceptionally huge, but loaded with protein, perfect breakfast before hiking South Mountain or any mountains.  This place is very small and we got lucky to have found a table after a short wait. Friendly staff and they work hard but it seemed they are understaffed from what I saw on the day I visited.  While it didn't have wow factors but I would still choose this place over chain restaurants next time when I am in the area during breakfast time."}
{"text":"I like this place and happy it isn't far from home, but my order is ALWAYS wrong or mixed up and they're just slow in general."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch joint.   The apple smoked chicken sausage scramble and the sausage, mushroom and tomato scramble are two of my faves. After one bite, it's hard to go back to having plain old oatmeal or sucky cereal at home. Unless it's Cap'n Crunch of course.   There's other tasty options here including fresh bagels, scratch made buttermilk pancakes with pecan butter, breakfast burros, salads, and sandwiches - if you aren't feeling so eggy. And their portions are quite big, so do come hungry!  The people who work here are very friendly and helpful. My first visit, I had no idea what to order because their menu is a smorgasbord of splendid. They gave me great recommendations - the scrambles and omelettes, and it made me want to come back as a result. They also work hard to make sure your dining experience isn't weak sauce.  Also, The Nosh Cafe is a nice, free wi-fi zone, so don't forget to bring your laptop or touchpad with you and get some actual work or budgeting done. Or better yet...scroll endlessly through your facebook feed and compare yourself to all your successful and not-so-successful friends from high school. All while scarfing down bacon and eggs.  That should bring the feels.  Since I normally work from home, it's great to get a change of scenery. Especially when it's a restaurant where one can destroy a delicious omelette or scramble and not feel so bad afterwards - like when eating at a breakfast joint that rhymes with Benny's.   Oh, I almost forgot - you can purchase a fresh cup of coffee here and get multiple refills! I make sure to lose track of the amount of coffee refills, so  that when I am reunited with my exhausted wife - I just explode energy. She absolutely loves that."}
{"text":"I've decided to make this place one of my absolute #1 go-tos for breakfast. Their sandwiches are great and their omelettes leave little to be desired, but what really makes this cozy, unassuming cafe a true hidden gem is the service - which always comes with a smile and pleasant remark. Their bagels are made fresh and they have a really strong variety. They're happy to adjust to your needs- This place is an absolutely amazing place to be a regular."}
{"text":"Generally love this place but they can't handle the load on weekends. We have been waiting 40 minutes and counting for our food. Not worth the wait but not worth starting over somewhere else. Plenty of staff. Kitchen likely too small to handle the volume. Hope our food doesn't come out cold.  Now 50 minutes and counting....  I took at least 55 min. I lost track of the time. Cashier commented to a co-worker that she felt sorry for us because we waited an hour.   3 other negative reviews from today. Not good. Fix your issues.  Your reputation as a quality independently owned business is trending in the wrong direction."}
{"text":"Amazing bagels and a great staff. I always get the build your bagel sandwich it's heaven!"}
{"text":"First timer! Food was good and not far from my house. I went around 7:30 on a Monday morning, it wasn't busy and bagels looked well stocked. I order 2 bagel breakfast sandwiches, everything bagel and turkey sausage. The bagel was good but instead of turkey sausage it was turkey bacon. I am not a fan of turkey bacon.... The bagel and egg was good."}
{"text":"Have to post this updated review to express our real disappointment in two aspects of our Nosh experiences.  First, repeatedly, time after time, the decaf coffee is either empty, almost empty, cold, or cold AND almost empty.  Secondly, today we discovered that if you order a piece of toast all by itself, you get charged $2.75. So, $1.09 for a bagel, but $2.75 for a measily piece a toast. What a ripoff.  Come on guys, step it up. Both of these criticisms need to be taken seriously."}
{"text":"We were passing through on a road trip and decided to try out this place. SO glad that we did! I had the \"Not So Common\" to go, which consisted of eggs, hash browns, biscuits and homemade sausage gravy. You could literally taste the butter in every bite! So, if you don't mind eating 1,000,000 calories in one sitting, it's totally worth it. Of course, they have plenty of healthy options as well."}
{"text":"I love this bagel shop. Discovered this through work as it is the go to place for bagel Fridays.  The works bagel, toasted with cream cheese is all I need for a happy morning!"}
{"text":"I can completely thank Yelp App for this great find, I was way too early to head into work and wanted some breakfast and not from a fast food chain, so I looked what was in the area and found the Nosh Cafe so off I went.  When I got there it had a little line, but don't worry, it moves sort of fast, while waiting in line I checked out the menu board and saw they had a lot going on, that I want to try it all, but I had to limit my choice to just one this time around.  Now they have breakfasts off the grill and breakfast sandwiches, so I knew the sandwiched sounded good, so I checked out the selection and went with the Ranchero on a jalapeno bagel and a large caramel latte. The Ranchero was egg, sausage, red onion & house made southwest cream cheese; it was a great breakfast bagel sandwich.  Happy to had found Nosh Cafe, and saw they do lunch and its less than 2 miles from my work, so I can pretty much say I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"We came here to meet up for brunch and it was awesome. The staff was very friendly and answered all our questions. The food is actually very good I can't get over the pancakes. They are so good so fluffy I have to come back."}
{"text":"Are you serious? How have I been missing out on this place for so long. Long line at 6 am! But they are a well oiled machine and I barely made up my mind before it was my turn to order. They have tons of regulars, they knew pretty much everyone's name in front of me. This place is fueled by smiles and amazing food. Got the steak skillet rare and over easy eggs. Great. Can't wait to try the other awesome stuff. See you soon guys."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. This is our first time but we will definitely come back. I ordered the South Mountain Burro. My wife got the 2x4 breakfast. Both were delicious and fresh. We don't like hash browns much but we actually ate the ones included in her breakfast. There aren't many breakfast places that are as good as what we experienced here. The Nosh would have gotten five stars if it was a little bigger and a little faster. That's the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. In fact if it were possible I would have given them a 4.9 because everything else was so good."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to the nosh ever since moving to ahwatukee. This is far more than a bagel shop they have full cooked to order breakfast like omelette's, pancakes, French toast, crepes, scrambles, cooked to order eggs, breakfast burrito etc. as well as a great selection of bagels. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Please support this great local business"}
{"text":"The service, and the considerate people is what makes this business successful. Of course the food is excellent but there are similar restaurants in the area but have terrible servers. I mean lousy attitudes, this place makes it enjoyable to eat and spend time there."}
{"text":"Its Saturday morning....I get its busy. We waited in line over 10 minutes to order and couldn't sit inside due to how busy it was. Then we waited at least 25 minutes for our food. I ordered a strawberry smoothie that tasted watered down. My fiance's country omelet plate had a hair in his food. My steak and eggs plate was ok except the potatoes were WAAAAAY TOO SALTY. For the amount of time we waited in line and waited for our food to be served subpar food....it was not worth it. We should have ate at Snooze or somewhere else. Very disappointed. Not coming back here"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Staff is friendly and helpful. So many tasty dishes trying something new each day haven't been disappointed yet! A must try!"}
{"text":"First time here this morning and it's a great place for breakfast. Nice sized menu and the house coffee was very good. I had the chicken sausage scramble and it was excellent. Large portion and cooked perfectly. Everything seemed fresh. Sat outside and enjoyed the perfect late April weather. Service was fast and efficient with a steady, heavy stream of traffic on a Saturday morning. Great place for brekky!!"}
{"text":"Been here several times since we live close and I'm not a fan. Wait times are long, my orders get messed up, customer service is indifferent at best, and the worst part, they use a microwave to cook everything. Gross! Seriously, eggs in the microwave is probably the nastiest thing ever. Skip this place. Far better options in Awahtukee for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"delicious bagels and cream cheese. this place always hits the spot. it does get crowded during certain hours, mostly on weekends. They have the best bagles and cream cheese. Around Halloween/Thanksgiving they have pumpkin bagels and pumpkin cream cheese and they are yummy! I also enjoy their veggie sandwich and roast beef sandwich."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for pancakes so I decided to stop in. This is a bagel shop but the great thing is you can get a full breakfast.   I ordered the pancakes and potatoes (see pictures). The pancakes were really good. They taste like a higher quality McDonald's pancakes. The potatoes were fresh and hot and the did not skimp on the portions.   You can purchase a single pancake if you'd like, so keep in mind they are huge. Make sure you ask for an extra syrup as well.  All and all this is a nice place for breakfast and I'll certainly go back."}
{"text":"I don't get it. We wanted to love this place, but I just can't. We waited in line for 30 minutes to order, and it was busy so we accepted that, but there were a lot of staff in the back and it seemed chaotic. We ordered finally and they ring in the order on one tab and then the girl typed in the total on the square and ended up over charging me. They gave me back cash to fix it once I realized what happened. You can watch them pour the \"eggs\" from a pitcher and cook them in the microwave. I got a bagel, egg and cheese sandwich, boyfriend got a chorizo burrito. My eggs were brownish green. The bagel was alright. The burrito was okay, chorizo was hard to find there.  And A large cold brew is $5 which is a bit much. Overall it was pretty awful, which is a bummer."}
{"text":"While the food is decent, I find it ridiculous they use microwaves to heat most things up. The biggest problem with the this place is their lack of attention to detail. My wife loves this place for some odd reason, but we will no longer be going at all. Without fail, nearly every time I ask to substitute something as simple as the type of cheese on a sandwich, they can't seem to get it right. I am not exaggerating when I say this has occurred approximately 11 out of 12 times I've ordered something there. I'm not asking for anything absurd or ridiculously complicated. It's convenient to go there since it's on the way to work, but I will gladly go out of my way from now on to go to Einstein's and likely pay more just to get my order correct. I like to support local if possible, but I can do so no longer here."}
{"text":"there is one problem with bagel nosh: it's not close enough to tempe! went there on a sunday a little before closing-the bagel selection was sparse but they offered to get us any kind of bagel we wanted. the garlic,feta, and dill cream cheese was amazing and the breakfast sandwich looked hella yummy! went to get a refill on our way out and the owner offered a free large glass of iced tea since they were about to close. the service was great andi might have to make the trip out there very soon!"}
{"text":"This bagel shop is excellent, even with a big crowd they know how to have perfect service. Their breakfast sandwich was on point, and the orange juice to match. I will probably come back for their bagels, maybe a half a dozen next time."}
{"text":"Service could've been a little better, but the food was great! Reasonable prices for tasty food; you can't lose!"}
{"text":"SO good. Stopped by here for takeout when we were n the area & got the chorizo burro and the lox bagel - both were amazing & pretty big. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a great book for Breakfast/brunch on the weekend. It has a 1 dollar sign bit it's in Ahwatukee so I guess it's realitive. I spent $40 on breakfast for 2 adults and 1 toddler. The food is great and the service friendly.the Los and works was skimpy on the fish though."}
{"text":"Saturday morning 7:10a.  Just dropped my car off across the street for an oil change and used Yelp to locate Nosh.    Walked right in, went up to the counter to order a build your own Frittata and coffee.  The gal at the counter was very nice and full of energy.  The wait time for my food was acceptable.  My Frittata was good/delish too.  It was delivered hot, tasty and fluffy.  Served with hash browns that were good but average.  I would return."}
{"text":"My first visit to Nosh was great! No waiting an hour for a table and the food was really good. A win-win on a Sunday morning. I ordered a bagel sandwich and a side of hashbrowns. The bagel was 1. Huge 2. Soft and chewy 3. Completely satisfying. The eggs were fluffy and the sausage was flavorful too making for an excellent bagel sandwich. The hashbrowns were also yummy. They were buttery without being greasy, salty and had just the right amount of crispiness. I tried a bite of my friend's pancake and that was good too - very fluffy.  The service was friendly and fast, too. The only downside was that it was a little loud inside. They did have a few tables outside but they were full. Next time if it's not too hot I would probably go outside for a little quiet. But either way, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went to The Nosh for a cup of coffee and something sweet, to my surprise they had a full menu for sweets and breakfast sandwiches as well. I got the nutella & banana crepes and they were to die for! The best crepes I've had in years! I definitely recommend this place and their coffee was bomb!"}
{"text":"Tasty place! Definitely the best bagel place around! I wish they would open a location near ray/101 because I have to drive 15min to this place - which is a lot for a bagel place in my opinion - but it's worth it! Their cream cheeses are really good! The only thing I wish they changed was I wish they cooked their eggs for a bagel sandwich on the griddle rather than the microwave. But the rest is good enough to overlook that fact."}
{"text":"If they had a 4 1/2 I would have done that. I love love love the food and the environment. Seating is little tight but still worth going. The point lost is the girls that still prepare food have their long hair in a pony tail down and flys all over the place so yes once or twice I've been In and ended up pulling out a loooooong hair and kinda eeks me. But I still go and just cross fingers and for as much as I've gone only couple times so I still go lol. Love bagel joints!!!"}
{"text":"A well made, last minute decision to eat out here instead of I hop.  It's understandably a crowded place. It took them a little while to get us our food. But the choices one can have and the taste is worth the wait.  Will go back here again. By the way servings are of a good size. So better be hungry when you go here."}
{"text":"This is a good breakfast place.  The bagels are good, the lox is tasty, and the sandwiches are plentiful.  Service is reasonably paced and there are tables both indoors and out to enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Ok - i said before that this place had amazing breakfast and lunch was still good but not quite up to par....I will eat my words. I swung by today to grab a bagel sandwich or wrap and ended up doing the \"create your own\" and it was FANTASTIC. I ordered bacon & turkey on my sandwhich and we all know what that means - \"oh they'll probably throw 1/2 a strip of bacon on there since i'm ordering 2 meats...\" Nope. It was a decent pile of bacon on there and perfectly crispy. Added avocado & lettuce, tomato, & a bit if mayo. Man, I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall ... Amazing brunch place in the neighborhood.. I have tried almost all their pancakes... Fresh and yummy food... Be ready to wait in line over the weekends as it can get packed,..  But totally worth it... I recommend all their bagels and omelettes as well ...good service and great place for a family breakfast ...inside and outside seating available with ample parking :)"}
{"text":"Some days on the way to work I will make a stop here... I order the same thing The Southwestern bagel sandwich it's always really good I would say split it with someone it's really a lot of food plus it comes with a cup of fresh fruit... It's a good start to a day I would say."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great. The coffee is spectacular. The food is healthy and fresh. Customer service is great. Friendly staff that will always go the extra mile to satisfy guests. (The place gets pretty busy, so don't go in expecting speedy service during breakfast/lunch rush)."}
{"text":"The staff is really friendly and the service was really fast! That's why I gave 3 stars. But the food was so bland and disappointing. I wanted to check this place out because it had so many good reviews but I don't know why now. I got the South Mountain Burro. Maybe their bagels are amazing. But their food? It's not something I'd come back for."}
{"text":"Long wait time for average food. One meal came out 10 minutes before the others' and then got a lame excuse for why the wait was so long. Go to IHOP instead, service and food are better."}
{"text":"For a bagel shop in the desert, it doesn't get much better.  Great selection of fresh bagels (I love the Salt w/ lox).    The service is quick and friendly, and the decor has local flavor you wont find at any big chain.  The owners really turned this place around about 4 years ago.  Now it is a thriving local hangout for the active adult in Ahwatukee.  In fact, they attract so many road bikers, a bike shop opened next door last year."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this cafe because of the ratings and boy did it not disappoint. We got the breakfast grilled cheese and mushroom sausage omelet. These were simply incredible. A lot of food for a great price. The beagles are amazing too. Definitely will want to go and enjoy again next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Eating some of the most fresh crepes I've ever had in my life! Hash browns to die for, omelets big enough for two !  Do need to say more!!"}
{"text":"Great little place to have breakfast, not big chain food but great quality food! I tend to judge places off the coffee, and it was definitely worth coming back for."}
{"text":"These guys have perfected the bagel and everything else they cook! Wow is the only word to describe them! Thank you Nosh! Your food is just incredible"}
{"text":"Tried the veggie bagel sandwich today. Liked it with the fruits side. Potato salad isn't veggie since it contains egg."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast and lunch spot in ahwatukee. The food is amazing and the staff is awesome!!! I love this place."}
{"text":"Not really kid friendly menu, and the food was decent, just not exactly worth the price you pay in my opinion."}
{"text":"The service by the women working the register, the bagel line, and food delivery are all amazing. They all have a great attitude. The manager however, was visibly rude to the workers. The Nosh is known for their bagels and due to managements lack of proper preparation and being proactive instead of reactive, they had almost no bagels. Instead of hyping up his team, you could see him giving them attitude and being frustrated with them. Unfortunate great workers are doing what they can and still doesn't seem to be good enough for their manager."}
{"text":"Food is good, they messed up my order though, for a first timer they don't really explain how it works and waited for my food for over a hour. Being in the food industry I understand but still ridiculous probably not coming back With that kind of wait."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get a bagel sandwich! They have amazing prices for the portion sizes! Their pancakes are delicious as well, and are served with almond butter!"}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are big size. I had the South Mountain which was yummy! We also had a side of biscuits and gravy and it was very good. I also ordered an iced coffee, very good. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty sweet place for breakfast or brunch, operates in fairly efficient manner, with lots of bagel types, spread types and sandwiches to choose from. They also double as a coffee shop, have patio seating that's great during this lovely fall AZ weather, and their staff is friendly, patient and knowledgeable about their items.  I ordered a toasted everything bagel with jalepeno cream cheese and a chai latte (sm) for a little over $5. I decided to try lox and they added that on for $2 (a 2oz ramekin). My friend and I sat outside on the patio, which was full, and we ended up stuffed in a corner.  Our bagels came out quickly, within 3-4 minutes, but our drinks took much longer. Both of us were already halfway through our breakfast before our chai lattes were brought to our table.  Quality of food matched the price, bagels were good (if not just a little cold), jalepeno cream cheese was SPICY and the lox was... mehhh I don't know if I'd get it again. My friend had a bagel sandwich and he seemed to enjoy that too.  I'd see myself stopping in here pre-IKEA day-long shopping adventure, but I'd like to see the drinks come out at the same time or even before the food."}
{"text":"Tough critic from the East Coast but this was a great spot for a delicious bagel or bagel sandwich. Sad im leaving tomorrow or I would go back again. Sesame bagel with honey but cream cheese= heaven."}
{"text":"I'm very impressed! I got the chicken applewood, spinach scramble and French toast. To quench my thirst, the fresh made orange juice was spot on. The scramble was heavenly, the customer service was friendly and the atmosphere was nice with the convenience of Wi-Fi. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Good chef salad and willing to make chicken salad without the bread. Good croutons from bagel chips."}
{"text":"Came in Sunday am and this place was hopping.  They seem to have a lot of regulars.  The hubby and I both had bagel sandwhiches and they were very tasty.  Much better than those at Einstein's... I am pretty sure that place uses powdered eggs.  However, I think I do like the bagels better at Einstein's and they have more flavored cream cheese.  I will probably come to Bagel Nosh again b/c I prefer to support the locally owned businesses over chains but I am not really sure if this place deserves the 4 1/2 stars it currently has.  Maybe part of that is due to my bad experience there.  I ordered a latte with my bagel sandwhich and it took a long time to come out, even after the food.  Then when I finally got it instead of coffee they had given me hot chocolate.  A simple mistake but it can be really jarring when your mouth is expecting one thing and you get another.  Plus I really don't like sugar in the morning and this was extremely sugary sweet.  They did replace it with the latte I ordered but it made me a little grumpy to have to wait so long for my coffee on a Sunday morning so it kind of ruined my day.  I will definitely give them another try and may raise the stars higher in the future.  But I think there are better bagel places in the area.  I LOVE Back East Bagels on Southern and I deeply miss Bruegger's that used to be on Rural and Chandler Blvd - they were the best!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great breakfast sandwich, this is the place to go to! My husband and I have have tried several ones and none have disappointed. Each bagel sandwich is about $7-$8 but they're a decent size."}
{"text":"Compulsive breakfast decision and I'm happy we chose The Nosh based on other reviews.  I walked in an immediately saw the breakfast enchilada special and decided to order it, They had me at 'green Chile and hash brows'.  My husband ordered 2 grand pancakes which were fluffy and soft, sweet and filled the entire plate.  The service is great and tables were all clean and ready for guests.  For our first time being here we will definitely return.  We ordered 3 breakfast and 2 drinks for $38"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, big servings, very clean, good service. The Frittata was excellent, the pancakes are divine. Great variety of dishes to pick from.. The Nosh Cafe will be our regular spot for breakfast! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I remember when this place was bagel nosh and it was the only place to get a good bagel. I must say now that there is competition I find myself disappointed.   I know the place offers more than just bagels now but I haven't had the chance to try them so I will stick to my experience. I regularly order a bacon egg and cheese on an everything (works) bagel. I enjoy the quality but here are my issues. Microwaved eggs. I mean really can we get something that doesn't look like it came from subway's breakfast menu this leaves the \"eggs\" unevenly cooked usually with a hot spot and a flavor that doesn't make you think fresh ingredients.   The bagel even toasted feels greasy and burned in spots because the toaster that it goes through hasn't been cleaned since the bought it and it flames up sometimes.   I will say I prefer this place over Einstein's any day especially Monday's when the bagel man on 51st/Elliot is closed but my money goes to the bagel man 9 times out of 10 now.  If you want to know what a real bagel should taste like head there instead."}
{"text":"We love The Nosh, in that staff is always very friendly and sweet, we're big customer service people. The food/coffee is great, and we obviously feel good supporting local Ahwatukee small business. We come here all the time and love it."}
{"text":"Ranchero was savory and delicious...don't forget to add some tobacco sauce and ketchup extra tasty when added on the opposite side of the garlic bagel"}
{"text":"I love Bagel Nosh!  I go there for Breakfast and Lunch!  Fantastic Menu with lots of variety!    I highly recommend the Dill Garlic Feta Cream Cheese!  It is wonderful and full of flavor.  You wont turn back!  I love this cream cheese on the whole wheat bagel and I also love it on the turkey bagel sandwich!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and waited in line for 10 minutes. Then our (cold) sandwiches came out almost 30 minutes later, and mine came out wrong. At least if they were taking so long to make it I would have thought they were being meticulous about it... Won't be back."}
{"text":"The long lines are completely worth it. My favorite place to go after an early morning weekend run. Or a later morning hangover. Or any morning at all really."}
{"text":"Great little spot with attentive staff and good food! The decor is inviting and simple, the prices are fair and the food comes decently fast. It's a great casual spot to grab some food. I got the South mountain burrito. It was very filling, with eggs taking up the majority of space. The bacon added a nice smoky flavor, and hash browns added a nice texture. The salsa they served with was great - mild and savory. The coffee was self serve and it did it's job!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's small and intimate and my favorite neighborhood breakfast place. The food is tasty and the staff is always friendly. The South Mountain Burro is my favorite. It's huge! Very tasty and filling. I love coming and sipping on my coffee and reading here when I have time. My favorite coffee is the Kona and you get unlimited refills, which is always a plus"}
{"text":"Probably one of the better bagel shops in town.  Its located inside of a shopping plaza, and easy to find as its right next to a Bashas.  I believe they make thier bagels on site.  Fresh, fresh fresh!  I like that.  They also have a great variety of cream cheeses and bagel flavors to choose from on their menu.    They also have a variety of bagel sandwiches to choose from.  Roast beef, tuna, even LOX!  YUMMY.  They also coffee, and some juices and pop as well.  Yippie!  What else I like about this place, is that its just not bagels.  They also have a variety of pastries to choose from, like muffins, and other stuff too.  What else I like about this place is that there is plenty of outdoor seating.  Thats a bonus! Prices are fair and reasonable, and service was fine.  Worth a try if your in the area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The biscuits and gravey are my go to almost every time I walk in to that place.  Anybody who goes there needs to try this!   The breakfast burrito is a close second.  Having these two items on the menu makes me think gaining weight and eating both may be worth it.    The bagels are a great way to go as well.  They have very good cream cheese and the bages are always very fresh."}
{"text":"When I came here, I witnessed very unprofessional behavior on behalf of the manager at the time. The way the employees were treated was very disrespectful and unbecoming, and I will not be returning. Sad!"}
{"text":"So I went to The Nosh today. The service was very slow and the girl who took my order was very rude to not only me, but also her coworkers. People who came in after us got their food faster and it has taken over 40 minutes just to make a bagel and a side of bacon. I am very unimpressed with this restaurant and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Just tried this place yesterday & I am in love. I ordered a cheese bagel with sweet habanero spread. It was the yummiest thing ever!! I sadly didn't get to try it until I got to work and by then it was cold but still delicious. It was so good I went back this morning and ordered it again! This time I ate it on my way to work. So yummy when it's warm and toasty! I will probably be back tomorrow and will try to make myself try something new. There are a lot of options!   While I am in love with the bagel, the coffee was just meh. One review on here mentions that the mocha is better than Starbucks. I would have to disagree. Tried the latte today and was also not impressed. I like my coffee to be more on the sweet side though.  Also the older woman who is mentioned in another review is just as you described: short with words and grumpy. It's kind of a turn off but when the bagel is that good I will put up with it!   I don't like the debit card machine and the place to tip. I feel obligated to tip every time because they just look at you waiting for your response. I don't mind tipping but if I'm just getting a to go order is it really necessary?"}
{"text":"FAVORITE breakfast spot, the lox and jalapeño bagel is GLORIOUS. Iced Americano with cream is strong but smooth. The staff is always so friendly, and all the food I've seen looks phenomenal. My go to."}
{"text":"If your oven is being installed and most of your menu can't be made, close for the day."}
{"text":"Really good bagel breakfast sandwich. They loaded on the bacon, it was perfectly cooked, and the jalapeno cheese bagel I picked it to be on had a nice flavor. Only downfall was that the food took forever to come out. Vistied on a Sunday morning around 10."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. When placing our order, the lady had trouble inputting the prices. She seemed all over the place and said she is just ready to be closed for the day. The place closed at 2 and we got there at 130. This was not the issue though.   I ordered the country omelet. The description seems enticing. It was served with hash browns, but theres also hash browns in the omelet. There was sausage inside as well as cheese. It was covered in a sausage gravy. I was looking forwarded to this gravy, but it was tasteless. Just the first bite of the omelet was just lack luster. The dish only improved once I put ketchup, and I don't usually like to use ketchup. But this seemed like a necessity.   I also ordered a chicken soup. The chicken noodle soup was the best item I tried there. It was very chunky and had flavor. It wasn't the best chicken noodle soup I've had, but it was definitely better than the country omelet, in my opinion.   The coffee was good too."}
{"text":"If your like myself a bagel loving New Jersey Jew then this place will satisfy the craving for a great bagel.Big fluffy and crunchy at the same time and adding the cream cheese and lox will only cost you 9.00 so a good deal too"}
{"text":"A great breakfast and brunch place. Their menu offers everything from pancakes to bagel sandwiches. Their homemade bagels are fresh and fluffy. They stuff their bagel sandwiches to the max and their breakfast burritos are the same way. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Not familiar with the area and found on yelp.  So glad! A great breakfast, fresh, good quality, large portions! A friendly staff helpful in my egg whites no meat choice. Lots of variety of bagels baked fresh daily! A delish way to start our day!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  The food here is barely above 3 stars, more like 3.5.  I've rated this place a 4 for reasons I'll list a little later.  I like independent breakfast joints.  They usually have something special or different that the big chains lack.  Like I said, the food here is generally 3.5-level.  There are a lot of microwaves here. But it bumps up to a 4 for a the following:  the bacon here is thick and good, the coffee was also solid, they have hash browns that are served crispy, and they have the \"Not So Common\" - a plate with 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and an order of biscuits and gravy.  I've never seen this combo at any other place as a plate, and it's $8.  It's almost all my favorite breakfast foods on a single plate, and this alone almost warrants the bump to 4 stars.  The pancakes here are average.  The hashbrowns taste average.  The biscuit was ok.  Ordered a plain bagel, untoasted, with cream cheese.  Can't even compare this thing to NYC or Montreal or some other bagel joints - it was not that good.  BUT, all those things listed above, bring up the rating."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I wish one was closer to me. I would stop here everyday before work. I visited The Nosh on a Saturday. And fell in love with all the bagel selection. The service was fast and the crowd of people drew me in.   I ended up with a breakfast bagel that had eggs/bacon and cheese. It was amazing! I thought they would only put like 2slices of bacon. They loaded my bagel with bacon and I was in Heaven. The prices are very reasonable and the staff is very nice. One staff even came from behind the counter to help me hunt down some grape jelly that had ran out. I recommend this place to everyone! I hope they expand the business! I will actually be making a trip to The Nosh this weekend! A+++++"}
{"text":"AMAZING food and wonderful service. I have no complaints about this place. One of the best French dip sandwiches I've ever had and their breakfast is wonderful. I will definitely be a loyal customer."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to The Nosh, and we really enjoyed it.   I had a breakfast sandwich that consisted of scrambled eggs, bacon, and cheddar cheese on a garlic bagel. They put a lot of bacon on the sandwich. It wasn't as crispy as I prefer, but I still enjoyed it. I also had an iced coffee, which was pretty good.  The people in front of us in line seemed to have several questions, which made our wait a bit long but it also gave us a chance to really study the menu and choose which bagels we wanted so we knew exactly what we would be ordering once it was our turn.   The food took a bit longer than I would have liked, but it was a busy Saturday mid-morning, so it wasn't a big deal."}
{"text":"Hello to all you foodies out there!  Been looking for a good Bagel place in the area, because as we all know, bagels are an essential part of life.  We know what the chain bagel places are all about....ok bagels and lousy cream cheese...so I am happy to say Bagel Nosh has some superior cream cheese.  Since this review is about finding a good bagel place, I guess we should start with the bagels.  There is a nice variety of bagels but alas....no egg bagel.  boooooooo  To me, the bagels are similar to the kind you buy in a grocery store bakery area...they are not dense(as I grew up with in Chicago or even New York) but almost fluffier, but they are still good.  So much for the bagels...let get to the cream cheese!    The cream cheese is creamy and thick but not too thick and very flavorful.  When enjoying their bagel and cream cheese sandwich it is safe to say it is the cream cheese that you notice.  I will continue to search for the type bagel I enjoy and in the meantime I will continue to enjoy Bagel Nosh.  I would also like to mention the service is great and the employees are wonderful and very friendly and that alone will bring me back!  Keep up the good work.  I think you should check this place out and in the meantime....  Bon Appetite'"}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of bagel sandwiches. I've always preferred just getting a toasted bagel and cream cheese when I frequent a bagel shop. However, the Nosh Bagelry not only has really, really good bagels and cream cheese (with lots of flavors to choose from for both), they also have affordably-priced and delicious bagel sandwiches. My husband and I tried the Nosh Veggie sandwich and the Nosh French Dip. The Veggie was standard but delicious, with veggie cream cheese and a bagel of my choice (I chose onion, naturally), and for only $4.99, I also got potato salad and a pickle. I know the French Dip ($5.99) sounds strange on a bagel, but it was surprisingly really good. The roast beef was decent, and the garlic bagel he chose added a little something special. One delicious touch was that the bagel was buttered; this, along with the au jus, made it rich and flavorful. I will definitely return here for either breakfast or lunch if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Friendly people. Good atmosphere. The dill feta cream cheese is amazing! And they have good wifi. If you don't like what you ordered or it's too salty they are very kind about remaking it. They know how to cook a good egg btw ... most places I got can't make an over medium egg."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. The tombstone wrap is absolutely delicious although they did make the portion slightly smaller it was for the best. Free wifi is great too."}
{"text":"Having just arrived in the Phoenix area, we were looking for a breakfast location to get vacation started.  I turned to Yelp, and Nosh popped up as one of the top rated spots near us.    They have a wide variety on their menu.  You can go for a scramble, omelette, breakfast sandwich, or something as simple as a bagel.  I decided on the chicken sausage scramble, and I was not disappointed.  The portion was much larger than I expected.  Eggs, chicken sausage, spinach, and cheese all combined in one tasty dish.  They didn't skimp on the meat, which was much appreciated.    Not only was the food tasty, but the prices were super reasonable considering the massive amount of food you get.  Definitely recommend it.  If we had locations in TN, there's no doubt I would be a breakfast regular."}
{"text":"I liked this place. An around the corner cafe. Nothing fancy - a good egg sandwich and a nice variety. Place was clean and friendly"}
{"text":"Fresh Bagel sandwiches are the best! Coda B was obviously still under the influence when he wrote his review because there is no \" $7 Arizona Classic\" here. All breakfast sandwiches are less than $5 and come with heaping portions of eggs and meat/cheese of your choice. Lunch is also served anytime with mounds of turkey, ham, bacon, or my favorite the \"Nosh French Dip\" roast beef. Fresh brewed tea is fantastic. You are always greeted with a smile. You are treated like family when you walk in. Thanks for all the great bagels!!"}
{"text":"This place is always great.  The quality of food is excellent (especially their bagels), there is hardly ever much of a wait, and the people working there are super friendly.  I go here for breakfast or lunch at least once a week.  I love the Tombstone Wrap, but you gotta be careful with that spicy cream cheese they use!"}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito never disappoints and the kids love the pancakes. Nice selection of coffee and bagels keeps everyone in the family satisfied. A little pricey but the food quality is good. For Ahwatukee it's probably 5 stars but sine there are better places around Phoenix its a 4. They should expand into a bigger space as this places gets crowded in a hurry."}
{"text":"Very clean place but if it's your first time they don't tell you that you need to get silver ware prior on your own. Food was awesome and service was great. Very friendly and respectful, it was like they new me.  Defiantly recommend this place. Great place to take a computer and do work or just grab breakfast.   Update... I came in on a Saturday morning. Waited 23 minutes for my food to only come out wrong. Avocado toast.... didn't know it was hard...."}
{"text":"Great environment, friendly service, and good prices. I got the The Cheerful Breakfast which is 1 egg, hash browns, 1 pancake, and bacon, sausage link, ham. I'm not a big fan of ham so I go it with Bacon, a side of Sausage, and an extra egg with cheese.   Everything was amazing. The Pancake was one of the best I've ever had, only downfall for me was the butter. It had walnuts mixed in which is creative but I'm not a big fan of nuts. But the butter was very flavorful and after I scraped off the but I was good to go.   This was my first time here and the menu had a lot of great options. But my first time places I try to stick with something traditional, if they mess that up I won't be back for the complex or special. I recommend it to everyone ASAP!   I will be coming back soon to try the lunch menu."}
{"text":"I AM IN LOVE WITH THE PLACE!! I get the South mountain burrito but substitute avocado instead of the bacon and it is delicious. I would defiantly recommend this place to friends and have already!! Friendly and fast service as well everyone always has a smile! A great way to start the morning off!!"}
{"text":"Found this breakfast/brunch spot on YELP, of course.  First time I came in, I ordered a bagel with strawberry cream cheese. Nothing special, but they do make their bagel and cream cheese! Which, I liked because it was freshly made.   The second time I came in, I saw the Green Chile Burrito! Which looked amazing, so I needed to try it. It comes with chorizo, that I substituted for steak instead.   OHHHH MY GOODNESS. When I took the first bite, it all just melted in my mouth. The green chiles, eggs, hash browns, steak, beans, and all the yummy goodness hit all my taste buds. It was just a special they were having on the weekends that was so popular that they are adding it to the menu now. The green chile was not spicy, to me. It might be for others. I highly recommended trying the Green Chile Burrito."}
{"text":"Great bagels, freshly made! Also, the Pancakes are fluffy, large and delicious. And on my last visit I finally tried the Wraps and those are outstanding too!  This is my favorite place to grab food after a run, hike or race on weekends :)  Dog friendly patio too :) :)"}
{"text":"Nosh is a nice breakfast spot.  These got dam fresh bagels tho.  I'm loving the sweet options including egg whites and turkey or chicken sausage, variety of cream cheeses including low fat but I usually just go with the egg white sandwich.  Great food."}
{"text":"this is a great family-run bagel shop. They remember your name after only a few times in and the bagels are always fresh. good coffee and the lox is good. I have nothing but good things to say here."}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwiches  by far!  they have a good selection of bagels and choices/combinations of ingredients to please anyone's cravings. normally we get the bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on an everything bagel with salt n butter, it is to die for! We  also get the go bananas..monkey... something like that, it is loaded with bananas, pb and honey, we like it on a chocolate chip bagel.  the only flaw is that they do run out of bagels and you do have to wait a bit to get your order, once you have it, it is worth it, but be ready to wait."}
{"text":"Not bad. I went with Dr Sarah for brunch one Sunday and had a build your own frittata and a bagel. It's hardly phenomenal but it's a good option for brunch."}
{"text":"Great bagels, always baked fresh. Lots of other brealfast and lunch items on the menu. Staff is always friendly. I come here regularly and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast!  Get anything you want -  everything is great.  Juat make sure you get a side of pancakes.  They're perfection."}
{"text":"You havent lived until you've tried one of their pancakes!! The service is great, the line never takes too long and the food is amazing. You can tell the owner goes above and beyond with his employees, creating dishes for the menu, and making sure customers feel welcomed. Cute breakfast spot that will become a morning tradition."}
{"text":"$9 for a lox and bagel sandwich, $9 freaking dollars.  That being said, I came here due to the Bagel Man being closed on Mondays and this place not my jam.  I ordered a reg bagel with garlic/dill/feta cream cheese and it was just ok.  The bagel was chewy but not good chewy, like sticks to your teeth chewy.  It was worth a shot."}
{"text":"The Nosh is ok.  Bagels are mediocre, nothing special.  The older lady who works behind the counter should stay at home.  She's short worded, unwelcoming, and flat out rude to customers.  If you want a real bagel with friendly service there is a much better place up the street on Elliot.  However, if you want an Einstein's copy with Darth Vader behind the counter, come to The Nosh."}
{"text":"Best brunch in a long time! We will be back. Everything was real good. I had the Country Omelet, which totally hit the spot. More than reasonable pricing as well."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here and being completely satisfied. We came in around 10am when it was slightly busy. Despite this, service, food, and coffee was spot on. I ordered the 2 x4 (2 eggs, your choice of meat, bread, and hashbrowns) and my husband ordered the hog wild on pumpernickel with the cartel coffee. It was delicious and service was fast. There is plenty of seating inside and outside so there were no concerns for seating.   I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"First time here... And let me tell you... So very yummy!!! I spent more then I wanted to, but I was happy. The food, coffee and staff were great."}
{"text":"Great bagel place!!! The breakfast sandwiches are on point!! The staff is always friendly and efficient. Give it a try you won't be disappointed. It's the best bagel spot in the Tuke."}
{"text":"What a cute little local bagel shop in Ahwatukee! I came here with a group of students, and the Nosh was more than accommodating! I called about 30 minutes before we arrived and the employees gladly set up a large table for our group outside. Further, they were so patient and kind to my students. The food was decent and well priced. I had a bagel egg sandwich with bacon for around 6$... not bad at all. They even cooked my egg over medium... fantastic! I would highly recommend the Nosh!"}
{"text":"I love the Nosh. This place has an awesome selection of bagels and cream cheese flavors. They also have a hot grill for those who prefer omelets, breakfast burritos and egg dishes. My go-to combo is their garlic feta dill cream cheese on their everything bagel. Gotta try their Kona Macadamia coffee too. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I recently visited The Nosh Cafe for breakfast and was impressed with the friendly staff and lack of wait times (even when they were busy).   I chose  the South Mountain Burro which hit the spot perfectly. Tasty and filling but not so much that I felt like a lead balloon afterwards!  The most important thing for me was the coffee. Delicious house coffee - apparently roasted locally so that's a winner :)."}
{"text":"Really had high hopes for this place especially upon arrival. It's hidden which is fine and great location for lots of traffic. Walking to the door you can see the line out the door which means great things always.   Come to find out we were wrong here. Menu and everything looked great till, where it went wrong was after ordering our food.  Drinks came out at a reasonable time, but the smoothie tasted watered down and with frozen strawberries that tasted like they been in the freezer for awhile.    As busy as they were they were completely unorganized.  Even with what it looked like 6 people behind the counter and 4 of them cooking it took at least 30 minutes maybe longer just to get our food.   Food arrives was thinking heck this looks amazing maybe I'll rethink the wait for the food.  Nope not one bit, about to take a bite of my food notice a hair probably nothing big but being mad waiting of course it's now a big deal. Tell the lady about didn't seem apologetic just asked what I wanted to go so I got a bagel so I didnt have to wait.  Then my fiancé's food she couldn't finish it tasted like they threw a handful of salt on the potatoes.    After leaving we started reading google reviews, should of read those first.  The way the manager replied made it look like he doesn't care about the customers and just wants there money.   Enter at your own risk but we will no longer be coming here"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town for spring training and we ended up eating here every morning cuz the food and service were amazing!!!!! The food taste fresh, homemade, and a lot of healthy options!!! Would definitely recommend this place for anyone in search of a healthy, hearty breakfast with incredibly nice employees!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast and lunch place in Ahwatukee.Bagels are fresh and second to none, the schmears are homemade and phenomenal, and the pancakes, eggs and sandwiches are the best. Customer service is great, and quality is consistent. Love this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in after MTB south mountain. My boyfriend and I both had the churizo burro and it was great. Not too busy food was served in about 10mins."}
{"text":"I do not give one stars unless the service truly sucked a two is what I can offer only because I went to this place on my lunch hour and it took over 45 mins for me to get french toast which I did not get to eat until I got home for the day and by then the french toast was nasty tasting like over cooked eggs. I cannot tell you what it tasted like while it was still fresh. If I go back to this place it will be when I have nowhere to go and time on my side"}
{"text":"We visited The Nosh Café while in town for a conference and used Yelp to find something nearby. Great find! The food here is absolutely wonderful. Be prepared for standing in line for a bit though - a good sign. In fact, once I saw the line, I knew that we picked the right place. We surely did!"}
{"text":"This place has great food. Definitely one of our favorite local spots...so why only 3 stars??? They ALWAYS mess up our order. I rarely write reviews but we ordered breakfast to go today and our order was wrong again. This is our third order in a row that has been incorrect. Get it together, Nosh!   Would I recommend the Nosh?...absolutely. I would just advise you to triple check your order."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! After years of driving by im so glad I stopped in - had a great selection and was packed. All the workers were friendly and efficient and the bagels were fantastic! Will definitely be going again soon :)"}
{"text":"We went to the nosh because we heard they had great hash browns. As you can see from my pictures they were probably the worst I have ever had. The food took a long time to come out and was definitely not worth the wait. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"To update, I've since been to this cafe several times.  It's been a good experience each and every one of them. To the staff in the front and the back of the house, thank you."}
{"text":"I have been coming to [Bagel] Nosh since they first opened here over a decade ago. Came in for a late (11:30) breakfast the other day and the grill had just closed but they still made me the bacon and eggs I came in for. The eggs were cooked perfectly over medium, no runny whites. Love that they have supplemented their bagel business with legit breakfast foods.   Good prices, good portions, good food. Can't really go wrong here and yes, the bagels are really good too. 4/5"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot on the go or eat in. They have first come first serve bistro tables out front that are perfect in non-Summer weather. Quick walk from South Mountain if you need a nice spot after a great hike."}
{"text":"Good little cafe for breakfast, can be crowded but it's pretty fast.  I ordered the french toast and veggie omelette. Got the chai tea. Omelette was alright, nothing special but it hit the spot. The french toaat was soft and amazing. Still love hillside a lot more but definitely will come back for the toast!"}
{"text":"i've been here quite a few times and it was delicious but after this time i will not return. my boyfriend and I both ordered the grilled steak skillet that was 9$ each. it took about 20 minutes in the first place but then by the time we got it, it literally had 5 pieces of steak!!!!! and then the eggs were super nasty, almost like they were cheap eggs! so I complained because this unacceptable for the price we payed and it didn't have the same consistency from the last time I had it. they made us more steak but by the time we got it we were already finished with our food... never coming back."}
{"text":"Great food, but sooooooo Islow.  Very chaotic and disorganized.  It literally hurts me too go there."}
{"text":"The best place for lox and bagels. The owner works is tail off to make this place a success. I highly recommend this place but get there early. It gets crowded fast as most good places do."}
{"text":"Yum! Stumbled upon this place while looking for a breakfast spot in the area.   Delicious cold brew from Cartel with a variety of flavored syrup options and several creamers.   Lots of menu items for both breakfast and lunch. I opted for a bagel breakfast sandwich which was a generous portion. Came with lots of eggs and bacon and it was toasted perfectly.   Dog friendly patio. Lots of seating. Clean interior.   Only thing that wasn't top notch was that the employee at the front counter taking my order wasn't particularly friendly.   If I lived closer this would probably be a regular spot I'd hit up to try different menu items."}
