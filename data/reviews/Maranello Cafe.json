{"text":"Came here for lunch one day.  I've lived in Port Credit for a while and didn't even know this gem existed.  The pasta that I ordered was amazing!  Home made fettuccine, sauce and meat balls."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, very reasonable prices.   It is really busy at noon hour but be patient - it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"A surprisingly-good hole-in-the-wall cafe near the edge of Port Credit.

I've known about this place for a long time (back when it was called Lino's), but never had a chance to visit until today, when a colleague at my work suggested we go here for lunch.

It's easy to miss this place, as it initially appears to be part of the same building that Aielli Ristorante is located in. (And I'm still unsure if they're associated businesses or not). The small door at the front betrays a large cafe with a lot of seating at the back. The layout of the place is a tad odd - there's only one corridor between the front and back of the cafe, and you have to go past a set of fridges with drinks to get there. Makes for a bit of a problem when it's busy.

I was surprised that I enjoyed their sandwiches as much as I did. Both of us went for the hot sandwiches - they're all $6 each, and come on Calabrese bread. As other reviews have mentioned, they don't skimp on these sandwiches. I asked for everything on it and got hot peppers, onions mushrooms and mozzarella. If I have a quirk about the sandwich, it's that it simply wasn't hot enough. Maybe that's just because I've had a lot of hot food in the past. It was very tasty, but when I say \"everything on it\", I expect them to load the kitchen sink, even the hot sauce.

There are also a large number of pastas they serve, and which I will try next time I visit.  We did see the original owner, who briefly greeted us before going on her way, and the cashier was very friendly as well. Seems like a really nice family-run(?) establishment.

I feel like this is a bit of a hidden gem in Port Credit. I've seen it before, but I didn't know they offered all these options until I stepped foot in the place. I am very likely to return to Maranello's soon, as the prices are great and the food is very filling."}
{"text":"I've only lived in the area for 2 years and since I'm Italian (& an ex-Woodbridge resident) I've been searching for a place like this! 

We ordered from Uber Eats and the food was packaged with care, hot and fresh. Delicious chicken and veal sandwiches! The pasta was fantastic (we tried the carbonara & the fettuccine alfredo- both AMAZING!). Actually we had a hard time deciding over all the amazing pasta choices! 

Will def order again soon and have already recommended to others!"}
{"text":"Warning:  This is a Mentor hangout.  So if you go during lunchtime, be prepared to see A LOT of private school kids.

For what it is, basically a spot for Italian sandwiches, pasta, and perhaps a strong coffee, this place gets 5*s.  It's simple, prices are very reasonable, and customer service is friendly than your average spot!  Size-wise there are approx. 12 tables, definitely larger than it looks from the outside.

The female making the sandwich was VERY welcoming, accommodating, and friendly.  I saw her go around and ask patrons if everything was ok, if they wanted an extra slice of bread, if they wanted their sandwich spicy, etc.  She really seemed to care which is rare especially for a quick lunch spot.

A Veal/Chicken/Eggplant Parm sandwich came on a fresh, Calabrese bun and included sauteed onions, sweet peppers, &/or mushrooms for $6.99.  \"Good Moz\", of the non-processed variety was a + $0.50.  This is a really good price and I could've easily just been satisfied with half the sandwich!

Primarily a lunch spot which is open until 6pm.  I'd definitely check it out again if I'm down in that area!"}
