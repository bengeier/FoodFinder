{"text":"What a gem!  This is an excellent Italian restaurant on the east side of Cleveland where you will find some of the freshest, high quality food around.  We went with a large group and were seated quickly.  Service was outstanding as was everything we ordered.  The eggplant parm was fantastic and one diner said it was the best she ever had.  The chicken and pasta dishes were superior and the fried dough at the end of the meal was sublime!  The food was authentic, delicious and excellent.  The noise level is fairly high and the place was crowded with expectant diners waiting at the front of the restaurant.  Here you will find outstanding food, great service and a professional and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best Italian food I have had in a very long time.  I got eggplant parm.  So so good.  They took the time to pan fry it for me ,when I said I was vegetarian and didn't want it deep fried.  So good. Bruschetta so good.  Bread with herbs at the beginning was so good I was full before I started anything else.  The owner came out and took the time to talk to our table.  Service was excellent.  Attentive but not annoying. We even got dessert.  Crime brûlée and zeppoles.   I may be full for days.  I suggest a pair of stretchy pants and a big appetite .  My new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Score:  4.5/5.0  Dined with my husband here recently for the first time, and had a wonderful experience.  Really, really, delicious food, attentive service, organized and professional operation.  We will definitely be back, in fact I'm actively looking for an excuse to dine-out at Piccolo's again very soon :)  Food:  Excellent. Being Italian, I'm a little picky when it comes to dining out Italian.  Piccolo's is excellent though.  We dined on the Suppli alla Romano appetizer, which was perfectly warm, crispy and surprisingly large! Order this and you will be happy!  Both our entrees came with complimentary house salads and again, they were nicely sized, fresh and had nice quality vegetables (no iceberg lettuce!) and a delicious dressing. For entrees we tried the Shortrib Angolotti and the Lasagne. The fresh pasta angolotti were huge ; I'd say 'large pierogi' sized.  The Madeira sauce was a tad salty for my tastes, but was still very flavorful and delicious. The lasagne was awesome; great flavor, huge and gooey. You can always tell a good Italian restaurant by the quality of their marinara sauce, and Piccolo's is top-notch. The portions for everything are what I would consider, \"healthy\", if you leave here hungry, you're doing something wrong. In general I got looks at other pasta dishes, bowls of soup, and some pizzas and everything coming out of the kitchen looked delicious.   We didn't order dessert (too stuffed!), but you get complimentary pizzelles, which is a nice touch. All and all the food here is very very good. Score: 4.5/5   Service:  We arrived on a Saturday about 5:30 without reservation and had to grab a seat at the bar. Not exactly my first choice, but I hadn't expected them to be busy so early.  Regardless of our seating predicament, the service from the bartender was great.  Naturally, we got our drink right away, but everything else from the complimentary bread, our appetizer, the salads, to the entrees arrived in a very timely fashion.  Overall, we dined there just over and hour, and that is because we were taking our time and enjoying a great place! We were warmly greeted when we arrived, the manager stopped by to check-in with us towards the end of the meal, and we were thanked on the way out. The place was definitely busy, and the staff was certainly moving quickly and multitasking, but overall everything appeared organized and fairly efficient despite the crowd. There specials of the day could be displayed a bit better perhaps.  Score: 4/5  Atmosphere: Moderately-casual atmosphere.  The dining room is tastefully and comfortably decorated enough without being stuffy or pretentious. Noise level was maybe a little higher than I would have preferred for a romantic dinner, but it was a minor inconvenience.  There are perhaps, an abundance of harder surfaces, so sound does travel a bit.  The restaurant is a little tight on space, and with a crowded dining room, things do get a little tight in spots between tables/parties.  They offer live music some evenings. Unfortunately, we were leaving just as the band was setting up, so I can't comment on the quality of the entertainment - but I'm a fan of any place that offers free music! Score: 3.5/5  Value: Considering the quality of the food, the variety of the menu, portion size, and overall atmosphere, Piccolo's offers a good value for the price.  I don't recall seeing any entree over $25ish dollars, with a majority of the menu at sub-$20ish.  For the amount of food you get, with the complimentary meal add-ons, I was pleased we dined here.  Also, kudos to them for actually filling a wine glass all the way up.  It's a nice to see an establishment that isn't charging $6-7 for a glass of wine that's barely a 1/3 of the way full.  Score: 4/5  Final thoughts: Highly recommended! Ideally suited for smaller-sized parties I think because of the limited tables and space. Consider reservations during peak dining hours. Come hungry, wear your stretchy pants ;)"}
{"text":"Went here with no reservations on a Saturday around 5ish and got seated at a high top but that actually was less of a problem than I thought it would be. Lots of empty low tops waiting for patrons with reservations. Happy hour was 4-6 but wine at $6 per glass... Three pinots before entrees arrived... SLOW!  But this is not eating its dining! Anyway mussels as app were TINY morsels and bread and oil were so so. Wife ordered chicken parm and said sauce was sour (asp as the Italians say). Salads were great with a dressing that was a solid 10! Place was buzzing and tables were full by six but entrees were very SLOW in coming even though ordering earlier when relatively calm So here comes my entree bow ties alio olio! Another 10 !! piping hot and delicious in a very generous portion. Honestly chef banged it out of the park. I'm not vegan but this would be great for those folks too.  You will ask for a box to go with this dish. I finished mine but wished later for a box.. We will be back especially for happy hour! Might try pizza next time since we saw many take out orders leaving . Ciao Bella!"}
{"text":"Tried Piccolo on a Tuesday evening and the place was very busy.Our server,Danielle,was very helpful and a joy to be with.The bread had no taste at all.The PEI Mussels were small and did not appear to be fresh. The seafood putanesca was a huge disappointment.(Burnt).The iced tea tasted like it was a week old.The place has only been opened for a short period of time,hopefully they pay more attention to the taste of the food. Arabiattas,Mario Fazios,Becky's and Gaetanos have nothing to worry about yet."}
{"text":"The best Italian food in northeast Ohio!!! I have introduced several people to this restaurant and they have always come back for more!!!! I definitely recommend call ahead for seating due to the popularity of the restaurant!!!! The staff is the best around!!!"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this place and as I have two small twins I put my hazards on in front of the store walked in to the hostess and said \"would it be possible that we could have a table for four with two booster seats\".   She looked at me with an upturned chin and downcast eyes and raised eyebrows and asked me \"did you make a reservation?\"  I took a second to process her facial expressions and responded \"I see how it is.\"   We went next-door to five guys. I will never go back.  Unless that lady is the owner, you guys need to get her out of there."}
{"text":"On Tuesday August 23, 2016 I had a taste for pasta for lunch so I did a search in Mayfield Heights area and here popped up Piccolo so I decided to try it.....GLAD I DID......WHAT A HIDDEN GEM.....I checked this place out...I was totally blown away.....great food....great happy hour with great prices.....give them a try you will not be disappointed.  Special thanks to Nikki and to Ms. Catherine and Chris......I definitely will be back....take a look at my pictures....it will leave you salivating."}
{"text":"We made a reservation at 3 pm on Thursday for 6 pm on the same day. When we got in to the restaurant, we were told that the restaurant is full and that some of the guests that had made their reservations two weeks ago are still dining and may or may not leave within half an hour. We were also told that the earlier reservations take precedence over the later reservations - not sure what this means but looks like a double-booking to me. No apologies, no invitation to wait at the bar - nothing at all. We left for another restaurant."}
{"text":"Always had good pizza here - last night I ordered a large pepperoni and bit into RAW dough! I couldn't even eat the pizza. Sauce was different too. Way too sweet. It was terrible. May be awhile before I go back and try it again."}
{"text":"This place left me feeling salty.... Literally.  We started by ordering calamari which I have had many places many ways but here it was salted so heavily it left me feeling like I was in the Sahara desert.  Then we moved onto the risotto balls which while cooked good we're not at all seasoned.  For our main dishes we ordered chicken Parmesan and a artichoke pizza.  I'm fairly certain that whoever breaded our chicken mixed up the bread crumbs and the salt because this thing was more salty then a girl who runs into her ex at the mall with his much hotter, younger girlfriend on his arm.  Our pizza was no better. Once more I think someone substituted the cheese for salt.  I must of drank 30 glasses of water. I'm convinced they salt everything to the heavens so that you keep buying overpriced wine. If your blood pressure is at all elevated stay the heck away from this place!"}
{"text":"I went with friends last night.  The food was delicious.  The service was atrocious!  The server was a pest, loud, and pushy.  We felt like we were an intrusion on her station.  We were there for only an hour and fifteen minutes; and when she cleared the table of dishes and came back five minutes later and literally grabbed all the water glasses...it was our cue to get up and leave and NEVER return.  If you can tolerate rudeness, the food is worth it.  Sorry, new restaurant, you lose!"}
{"text":"Bread wasn't warm, their pasta taste okay. Restaurant itself looks nice, nice environment and cozy. Average Italian Restraunt."}
{"text":"I don't know if they changed chefs or what. We have eaten there several times and it's been fine. The latest take out order was inedible. Veal Marsala was drenched and the veal wasn't good quality. Lasagna was not even recognizable. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Sauce on my side of pasta way to sweet  Ordered breaded shrimp appetizer breading overpowered shrimp My wife's spaghetti & clam sauce not many clams Bread was good I've had better Italian food"}
{"text":"I actually came here to order take out. The restaurant is a lot fancier ambiance wise than I had thought based on the exterior. I ordered chicken alfredo and calamari. The portions were great I split this with one other person. The alfredo was delicious I had enough to take to lunch the next day. The calamari taste kind of bland but that could either be due in part to the fact that I had it for take out and it got soggy. Would definitely revisit to try their other pasta."}
{"text":"Accommodated our group of 16 with very short notice (less than an hour) on a Saturday evening. None of us had ever been to Piccolo, even though we all live in the area. Everyone cleaned their plate or had a to go box - even the nine year old raved about the salmon and said her Italian wedding soup was the best she'd ever had.  We all enjoyed our meals and the evening...braised short ribs in pasta sheets, lasagna, chicken parm, chicken piccata, crab cakes, pizza, and on and on. The service was so good,  that it made the evening seem effortless to us - none of the staff seemed the least bit ruffled by our large, busy, loud group. And they didn't miss a beat - no order was missing, no food sent back, no water glass or drink left unfilled.   Very attentive and and thoughtful service - everything was well timed, too. Well done!  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Food was great, but they charge for any changes.   I met a group of friends there.  I had surgery a few weeks before and am restricted on what I can eat.  I ordered Chicken Marsala and it was excellent.  I didn't have the salad with the meal and asked for vegetables instead of pasta.  I was charge $4 dollars for the substitution.  That seems to be a bit excessive.  Service was just ok.  Once our orders were taken we were promised bread, but it didn't arrive for 15 minutes.  The server was busy and we were often taken care of by the busser."}
{"text":"We used Piccolo to cater a company luncheon of 60 people and everyone was beyond impressed with Piccolo's Chicken Piccata and Penne Rosa pasta.  Even the salad was beautiful in its presentation.  Thanks Joann and Mark for your perfect suggestions and delivery!"}
{"text":"Super staff. Fantastic food. Wonderful atmosphere. If you can't tell we really loved this place. Don't miss out. Be sure to visit!"}
{"text":"We stumbled into the place after going to another business in the plaza.  At first glimpse we thought it was a chain but entering the place I saw the review in the local paper that I had read.  The raves in the review were correct. The bar is a long granite or marble setting with comfortable chairs.  Although stuck in a boring plaza the atmosphere is hushed, dim lights, Italian setting but not cheesy Italian.  The artwork partly consists of photos of the Carnegie Bridge, an icon of Cleveland architecture.  We stayed for happy hour, a rare treat for a Saturday.  Great selection of food and wine, pleasant and attentive bar help, thank you Randi!  I really liked the place and will be back.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Some ups and downs on our first visit. Here's the list: Two top tables too small. Delicious oil needs more hearty bread choice. Calamari app needs lots of rework. Maybe consult with Lockkeepers chef for example. More focus on good service.  Caring staff, managers good. Beautiful dining area. Entrees were good. Cannoli delish!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I have to say that I'm glad Mother Nature dumped her load of Cleveland snow and forced half of our group to stay home when we chose this restaurant as our pick this month for a club dinner.   Really my complaint is mostly with service but the one dish 4 out of 5 of us ordered, lasagna, was not good. I tasted my husband's and was not at all impressed. He left more than half and for him, that tells the whole story. The red sauce on my pasta was sweet and terrible and I only had one bite. The chicken parm that I ordered was fine, easily forgettable.   My main beef, however, is the service. We were fine being downgraded to a smaller table, no problem, but at that point our previously attentive waitress found better things to do. It took her at least 15 minutes to acknowledge the last two arrivals then she disappeared while we survived on bread and wondered when in the hell we would be able to order our food. 15 minutes after that she asked about appetizers and we immediately said uh we're ready to order, too. But then, besides a brief round of average salad, we waited AN HOUR for our meal. An hour!  Other tables were getting their orders (and finishing) so I can't imagine the kitchen was that backed up. After I tasted what everyone ordered but me, I was completely embarrassed that I'd picked the place.   Finally, we had to wait for our checks too. She did come back right away with the people that used credit cards but she told us she would be back with change, set ours on the empty table next to us and never returned.  I'm not sure what happened as I really thought this waitress was going to be great and was excited about the food. The breadsticks are good, thank you Jesus, but I can't get over that lasagna and their red sauce. We dine at lots of Italian restaurants and this is neither authentic nor delicious.   :("}
{"text":"We came in on a whim because we where hungry and we had been driving by this unassuming place for months.  We split the calamari Giovani I had the Short ribs and my wife had the Bowtie Pasta and we where pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and staff. We are definitely going to put this on our return dining list."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find!  We were making our weekly pilgrimage to Costco today when I noted my husband was getting a bit Hangry....  I pulled out my magic phone (that's what he calls my iPhone  ) and pulled up the YELP app.  I asked what he was hankering for and he mentioned spaghetti .  So off I went in search of a local Italian spot with a good number of reviews and $$ pricing.  We don't limit ourselves to 4+ stars as so many times we have found amazing places to eat with 3-3.5 stars!    But I digress.... we found Piccolo off SOM Center in Gates Mills Place and decided to give it a shot.   It's not a very large place 20-25 tables and a large bar.  Atmosphere is upscale casual but comfortable too.  It was 6:40pm on a Saturday night, we were greeted by very friendly staff and even through we didn't have a reservation they said hold on we have two tables getting ready to leave.  We were followed in by 2 other parties and they had all of us seated within 15 minutes.  The manager came over half way through our meal to check on us - and I observed her visiting many tables.  Classy.  We ordered two appetizers, the fried zucchini and the Suppli Ala Romano (risotto balls stuffed with with Motzerlella and deep fried.  The zucchini was cooked perfectly which is hard to do with 1x1x6\" planks and served with a garlic aoli.  We asked for some marinara because the aoli was a bit too full of chunky garlic for our taste.  The risotto balls are fantastic!  Crisp, huge and full of yummy cheese.  Seriously good eats.  Served with marinara and pesto sauces.  So here is my caution ---- we were already stuffed and our entrees weren't even delivered yet .  When the entrees arrived they were beautiful plates and yep, HUGE!!!   I had the Picolli Pork Chop, served with Swiss chart and tomato risotto.  A 1.5\" thick chop cooked perfectly.  My husband had spaghetti (of course) topped with oodles of Italian sausage slices.  Nice touch to slice the sausage as so often he has to fight his food.  I had a lovely California Cabernet ($7) okay I had two  and my hubby is a water drinker.  Oh did I mention the Matre D also stopped at the table to see how we liked it, we had mentioned to him it was our first visit - definitely first of many . We got desert to go (limoncello marscapone cake) and they boxed our leftovers up so nicely."}
{"text":"Ambiance and service is a B+.  The food however is an A.  The calamari with sweet peppers was very delicious for an appetizer.  The gnocchi rosa had amazing Italian sausage.  My party also gave great reviews to the linguini with clam sauce."}
{"text":"Wonderful setting. Great food. Good service. All-in-all we enjoyed the ambiance, meal and conversation... A modern romantic evening for two."}
{"text":"I really hate to give this restaurant 5 stars because it will make it even more popular than it is now.  But I have comment on the best restaurant in the area.  The happy hour is not to be believed.  A huge plate of bow tie pasta with chicken for 6.00?  Crazy!  I think my Nona is in the kitchen.  The best food ever at ridiculous prices.  Plus Randy and Genise are the best bartenders in Northeast Ohio.  Please don't come here.  I love the quiet, intimate atmosphere."}
{"text":"Super authentic Italian food. The service is really fast and friendly. It is really a hidden jem in an unassuming shopping center. I particularly enjoyed the Spaghetti in Clam Sauce."}
{"text":"Owners and servers were very friendly. The place is very popular so we gave it a try, many of our friends said it was their favorite restaurant. The food and price were average, there are 3 or 4 other Italian Restaurants I prefer over Piccolo's. The place is very small and loud, the servers were very pleasant and efficient, I think the kitchen has a problem, after we had our drinks and salad served it took 1 hour and 15 minutes to get our main course. I would give them another chance just because of the effort put in by the owners and staff."}
{"text":"Met my husband here for lunch and I have to say we were pleasantly surprised! The staff was extremely nice and attentive. The dining room was cozy and clean. The server brought over a basket of warm bread with oil and parm cheese to dip it in. It was so good we wanted to get another basket of it!  I ordered the pasta carbonara and it was creamy and had a tons of flavor. My husband ordered chicken piccata and he loved every bite of it! The portions were huge, I ate the rest of mine for dinner. The price was right too! We will definitely be going back to this cozy place"}
{"text":"First time here on sunday....food was fantastic and the service was just as great. The calamari was one of the best I've ever had. Would highly recommend dinner here."}
{"text":"Food is very good but arrogant bartender ruined the experience.  Don't know if she is one of the owners, but she acts like she's doing you a favor by waiting on you. The questions we asked about the menu were given one word answers as if she was too busy...and only a handful of customers at the bar.   Don't know why someone more personable doesn't take her place."}
{"text":"Well, we went in a Friday before 6 pm. It was quite crowded. I asked how long a wait for two and the woman at the host stand just looked at me and said \"we will only have the bar.\" She wouldn't tell me how long the wait was. Since we had orchestra tickets we didn't hang around. My husband has been there for lunch and really liked it and didn't realize they took reservations. This would have been my first time there. Too bad the hostess was so....um...abrupt."}
{"text":"Awful experience, maybe the worst I've ever had. From the pile of trash under our table, to slow service, to awful food that only tasted of salt and sugar, we've never had a more miserable experience. To make matters worse, the service is atrocious and unfriendly. Rating this place 1-star is too kind."}
{"text":"I love everything about this restaurant! The food is great and so are the drinks, the service, and the atmosphere. I've been here twice and both times I was equally satisfied. The do everything to make sure their customers are satisfied. I've noticed they are a little undermanned with the staff but they're still doing a great job with attending to customers in a timely manner. This is one of the best restaurants in this area in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Love the bread they serve in the beginning of the meal. Well-made meals. The one thing I do NOT like is that their red sauce is too sweet so I steer clear of the pizzas and pasta."}
{"text":"Second time here. This time for dinner with my two kids. The place was packed but we were able to get seated right away. The server was very pleasant but extremely scarce. I asked 3 people, one of them the server, for butter and finally after 10-15 mins the busboy brought it to us. Overall the food was good/ okay. The bread with the dipping EVO was tasty. My daughter ordered the pasta and meatballs. The meatballs where just okay for me; too bread crumby for my taste. (Gaetanos is the place for the best meatballs in MH!). Marinara sauce was nice also. My son got a large pizza that he said was okay (I haven't tried it yet!). I ordered the chicken Marsala which came with a salad and a side of spaghetti. I got 4, about 2x2, pieces of chicken. It tasted pretty good except for the Marsala sauce was a tad too sweet for my taste. I don't even recall ever having a sweet Marsala sauce. The pasta was also good but nothing to write home about. I do feel my dish was overpriced for the amount of food I got. I'm really undecided about whether I would recommend this place or not. The service left a lot to be desired and the food is just okay."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of coworkers for lunch (6 of us). We were seated at the \"God-father\" table (round booth table) promptly. Although the restaurant didn't look too busy, our food order took a while to arrive. Even the appetizers took close to 15 minutes. While waiting we were served bread with dipping oil. The bread itself had a nice crispy crust but it lacked flavor. The seasoned olive oil definitely helped.  I ordered the spaghetti with clam sauce. The portion was generous. The sauce was quite good. It was a white wine sauce with a hint of vinaigrette and olive oil. There was plenty of clam meat but overall it was a bit oily.   Despite the longer wait for the food, the server was attentive and the food is quite good for the money. Overall this place is off to a good start. They have quite a selection on their menu with things such as Italian soups, pizzas, pastas and even sandwiches."}
{"text":"Any plate or app has been fantastic, portions will leave you with leftovers. Make a reservation or you will have a wait. Seems to be many regulars, so be prepared to see some focus there,  but I am OK with that as I would hope for the same. Sit at the bar during happy hour as some better deals and service is pretty decent."}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland on business Friday night and wanted a nice place to eat dinner. It was later than we usually eat, so I was hesitant about choosing Italian, but we were tired and didn't want to go far from our hotel. We found Piccolo in a little strip shopping center with a few other restaurants (more along the fast food line). Even though it was late, the restaurant was almost full. They had 2 tables available, though, so we didn't have to wait. There were lots of delicious options on the menu, so it was hard to decide, but I ended up selecting Cavatelli Peppe (Ricotta cavatelli sautéed with garlic, broccoli rabe, pancetta and romano cheese) and my husband ordered the Tutto Carne pizza without cheese. We both had salads and they were delicious. The greens were fresh and crisp. Our dinners came quickly and both were huge. My pasta was cooked at little more than I would have liked, but the taste was delicious. Neither of us could finish our dinners and our server boxed them up perfectly. The styro containers were wrapped in plastic wrap which was a wonderful idea because pasta sauce usually manages to ooze out of those containers! We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We were passing through Cleveland area and found Piccolo on Yelp!  What a great surprise. Margaret, wouldn't steer us wrong!  Prompt and attentive, she made our stay well worth it.   I had the Chicken Piccata, and my wife enjoyed the Pancetta, broccoli rabe served with cavatelli.  Wow.  Glad - again - Yelp didn't let us down...we will return to Piccolo."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight based on reviews. I ordered eggplant parmigiana which was mostly seeds and cheese. It was a soggy mess. I asked for a sweet wine as that was what I was in the mood for and was told that I must be a newbie with a lack of pallet for wine. I'm in my 30s!!! It was very condescending. My husband ordered the veal parmigiana which was doughy and extremely soggy. When the waitresses asked if he liked it(after not eating very much) I replied with he likes it crispy. She very rudely snapped well you should have said that!! And walked away. They have us four of the tiniest pieces of stale bread. The only good thing we had was the water. The pasta was over cooked and mushy, I've had more authentic Italian food at the Olive Garden!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been partaking in the Piccolo experience every Saturday evening since they opened. The food and service rival any well respected restaurant in the the Cleveland area. The ravioli stuffed with short rib are delicious, along with everything else on the menu.   Be sure to make a reservation, as this has become a mayfield hot spot!"}
{"text":"Ok this was my first time here and it was like 10:30 pm close to closing time we was the only people in there and it was a Friday the service was great bread and water was brought to the table immediately the lady was very nice the restaurant looks great walking in and in the dining room we chose the calamari and its was great we ordered it plane but it comes in sautéed peppers, I ordered the vel parmigiana and my wife ordered the chicken parmigiana with a side of spaghetti and I really hate to say that both of our dinners was unbearable unfortunately but I keep telling myself that maybe it was so close to closing that's why it was bad but I'm never going back to find out. All in all good service good appetizer bad dinner."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best Italian meals my wife and I have had in years! That includes Giovanni's, where we were a few weeks ago. And the price point is much more manageable."}
{"text":"Still excellent value for the dollar and wonderful, friendly service.  I love consistency."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. Food is exceptional, the atmosphere friendly and the service is excellent. I highly recommend  this restaurant."}
{"text":"So Impressed with Piccolo.  It is a family-owned Italian restaurant where the service was exceptional, the food was absolutely delicious, and everyone was so very nice and welcoming.  It's not the fanciest place, but the tables have white tablecloths, the food is reasonably priced and the value is absolutely 5 star.  I will return often."}
{"text":"The sauce was too sweet for my liking and the service was horrible but the waitress was nice! I would however return and try something else but only if I had a lot of time on my hands!"}
{"text":"The food was underwhelming. The calamari tasted more like orange chicken than actual calamari. My party and I waited 50 minutes for 3 pizzas, all of which were, again, underwhelming. Service was nice and considerate however. Clean restaurant, nice location, just not as expected. Try Mama Santa's for real Italian Pizza."}
{"text":"Service and food were just okay.  If I really just need some Italian food and don't want to make the trip down to Little Italy, this is an okay spot, but probably not going to be the first that comes to mind.  We came in right at noon on a Saturday and there was one person sitting at the bar on his phone.  The rest of the place was empty.  We slowly milled around waiting for someone to appear, but no one did so we sat ourselves.  The person at the bar looked up when we passed him, said hello, and went into the kitchen.  So apparently he worked there, but didn't bother to help us out.  A minute later someone appeared from the kitchen and asked us how many people we had in our party, and then disappeared.  A waitress then came out and took our drink orders, and service seemed to be okay after that.  It just wasn't a friendly start.  Some of the food was fine, others, just okay.  But nothing phenomenal.  The fried zucchini was pretty good - nice zucchini to batter ratio, and crispy, but the sauce was much too garlicky.  I tried the gnocci rossa, which was just okay.  The sausage, mushrooms and peas in a tomato cream sauce just didn't seem to be the right combination of flavors.  My dish, the cavatelli peppe, was too salty to eat much.  The pasta was cooked fine, but the sauce, broccoli rabe and pancetta added just too much salt to the overall dish.  The best part of the meal? The complimentary bread.  Nothing phenomenal, but with the dipping sauce, it was a nice way to start off the meal."}
{"text":"Chicken masala was great! Terrific sauce. My wife had chicken parm which she enjoyed. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and atmosphere!  This was my first time here and I'm so glad we decided to try the place.  First off, the place is beautiful and we were seated promptly even though the place was packed.  I ordered the spaghetti in clam sauce and calamari appetizer.  Both were excellent!"}
{"text":"did not enjoy my visit Ordered app wanted risotto  After discussing the different kinds of apps they offered I decided I did not want the arincini fried risotto  But just a side of rissotto it returned to me as the fried rissotto  waitress proceeded to argue with me saying that that was what I ordered I said I'll just have my wine and she continued to disagree Friend ordered salad and soup and could not finish her soup so I asked for it to be boxed up when it returned to her it was 1/4 of a cup of her soup in her takeout container when we asked where the rest of the soup was they proceeded to argue that that's what it was  owner stopped by table and made a comment that I did not order the risotto right when I said I did she said oh well it'll make a nice dinner for myself   Realized that these people like to argue with you and the customer is not always right"}
{"text":"First time there on Saturday night. Sat at the bar with a friend. We ordered zucchini app & 8\" pizza. Sharred both items. Food. & service was excellent. I will be back. Loved the comp pizzelles at the end of our meal. Keep up the consistency & you will stay in  biz...."}
{"text":"Another good meal.  Two of us had the Veal Piccata, which continues to be among the best anywhere.  Make reservations as this place has become very popular.  Entrees include a salad and pasta and you won't leave hungry.  This is becoming one of our favorite places."}
{"text":"What a great surprise!  While visiting my son in Mayfield Heights, OH, I found myself walking and looking for a place to have a steak. Though the outside look was not impressive to me, due to the lack of options I found myself accidentally at the Piccolo Restaurant. This place is not a joke, it's the real deal! Amazing Italian food and great house Cabernet. Also had the opportunity to meet lovely Johana, one of the managers there. Ah, and how I could forget, the waitress that served me was so kind and friendly.  My dinner experience was great and if you are visiting the area you should try it too."}
{"text":"Terrific from start to finish Lora and Randi treat you as an old friend. Thanks!   Food was exceptional from the OO and parm dip... and on and on.    Keep up the great work... Jeff"}
{"text":"Located in a newer shopping plaza next to the Honey Baked Ham.  I love the nice and classy atmosphere!  From our few visits the greeter has always been nice and courteous to us often asking us if we would like a table or booth. The dining area is clean and the bar is pretty nice.    I haven't had a bad plate here so far.  While waiting for the food to come out from the kitchen, the table is presented with a plate of bread and side of oil with seasoning to dip the bread in.  Sometimes we ask for a side of red sauce to go with the bread and they have accommodated.  The chicken parm, fork and knive meatball sandwich and veal parm is fantastic.  The portion size is pretty generous.  The rosemary fries are awesome.   I usually end up taking home some leftovers.    The lunches are a pretty good deal for the quality of food you get.  I would not hesitate to come here.  This is one of my favorite Italian spots in the area with a solid menu."}
{"text":"This is one of best restaurant that I have been to. Chicken marsala was amazing with good quantity. That sauce they used for marsala was awesome. We also had chicken penne sorento which had white sauce was also amazing. A must try place but make sure u make a reservation first because its always crowded and can make u wait for an hour."}
{"text":"am i missing something? my fiancé and i decided to order takeout from piccolo last night (11/3/17) and what a mistake that was. we ordered the calamari as an app and i had the bow tie agolio and my fiancé had the gnocchi. when he picked up the food he was informed that they prepare my dish with a handful of cheese even though this wasn't mention in the menu description (i am severely allergic to cheese). the hostess said they would remake it, except they charged him half for it. i found that to be quite bizarre as it was nobodies fault but i chalked it up as poor hospitality.   my fiancé got home with the food, which i can only describe as the least authentic and worst tasting \"italian food\" i think i have ever had. first, the pasta was extraordinary over cooked and the consistency of complete mush. the chicken was the literal tasteless rubber. my fiancé's gnocchi was swimming in sauce like it was supposed to be soup. after two sad bites of my food i discovered a giant long blonde/ grey hair in my pasta, that was the real icing on the cake. we called the restaurant and told the hostess and she said that none of the cooks have long hair and they're actually all black and have been cooking italian food for 20 years. this is just in no way possibly true. my fiancé then had to drive back and got a refund. i'll also mention he said the calamari was completely inedible and also the consistency of mush. the hostess offered him a gift certificate in lieu of a refund as if we would ever return (this was our first time.)  i truly am astonished at people enjoying this place. there is nothing authentic about this food and i can confidently say that because i am 100% 3rd generation italian. you have to TRY and make food this bad. you know the quality of ingredients isn't good when a restaurant doses everything in cheese an sauce. 1 (required) star because the hostess was very apologetic and friendly."}
{"text":"Beautiful establishment.   Welcoming from who I would guess as the owner(s). Seating great. Beautiful bar. Server (Brian), was awesome.   Had the wedding soup I heard was \"to die for\", eh, I wouldn't go that far. It was bland. But not terrible.   Spaghetti with clam sauce, good flavor, but holy smokes it has a bit of a kick you in the throat spice to it. Pepper flakes, not a good thing. I have had better that didn't burn my throat. Lesson learned.  Had to take a meal back, it was some white wine sauce pasta dish, it was swimming in white wine that could or should have been cooked down much more. Almost felt guilty asking to take it back.   Bread was awesome and salad, great. Dressing amazingly good.   This feedback isn't meant to be negative, but just our personal feedback. Opinions."}
{"text":"I'm really sad to write this. I have been to this restaurant SO many times and every time before this it has been great food and great service. But tonight was terrible. Chris M., a young blonde kid with an attitude and no manners was our server.  He was very short, rude and forgot that he is in the business of customer service. I ordered the Italian Cobb salad. I assumed this was a dinner salad and that it would be brought out with the rest of my friend's dinners...but no. I was brought my giant dinner salad (without the chicken) when everyone else was getting their side salads. Then 10 minutes later I was handed a plate of chicken. And guess what? It was cold and salty! I told my waiter and he gave a confused look and did not apologize. I then asked for salmon instead and 20 minutes later after everyone was don't eating I got a small burnt piece of salmon.  Icing on the cake? They didn't take anything off the bill, no apology and when I told the female manager about what happened she proceeded to argue with me and ask me to hand her the box of my food that I barely touched. Not sure what has happened to Picollos but it went to being one of my favorite Italian restaurants to being one of the worst."}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant that is run by a family does an amazing job of bringing high quality Italian food to the Cleveland area. No more chain Italian restaurants for us. This restaurant is usually very busy, reservations are suggested. I often times get takeout from this restaurant and it absolutely wonderful. The portions are large everything comes with a salad and bread. The pizzas were wonderful. They even have a nice  display of Italian cookies. There's always enough food for leftovers for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Even less impressed upon our 2nd visit.  First time we dined the food was just ok and we had no plans of coming back. We had an awful table that was in the line of traffic at the corner of the bar and right outside the kitchen door. It was not a pleasant seat and made even more tense by the constant lapping the host and hostess made passed our table watching for when other diners would be paying their bills and leave so they could seat those waiting for a table.     We only went back because a group of friends wanted to try the place. This time the table location was better (along the side wall) but they tried to cram 10 of us at a table that barely fit 8 by the time you added dinner plates, glasses, bread baskets etc.  Thankfully 1 couple cancelled at the last minute so the table worked ok as long as we shared bread/appetizer dishes.  Service was fine... server worked her butt off and the bus staff kept pace. Food & beverages were brought out fairly timely.  Calamari was tender but a little bland. One diner found the bristles from, I suppose, a kitchen scrub brush in the calamari.  Size and ingredients of dinner salad very good and just the right amount of dressing. Wedding soup tasty and zucchini planks ok but nothing exciting.  The biggest disappointment were the main courses. The (2) Veal and (1) eggplant parmesan dishes so salty they were inedible. Chix marsala dish so loaded with sauce it diluted the chicken taste. Same was said of the braised short ribs - but for the description on the menu he wouldn't have known he was eating meat. Neither complaints nor praises of those who ate the chicken parmesan or the cavatelli. Fried dough was great."}
{"text":"Authentic, Delicious, & Fabulous... the Trifecta!  We popped into this establishment with relatively high expectations. After all, we had eaten at the owner's other venue and were rather smitten with those offerings.   So once through the doors, a few things had become apparent...   1) Clearly the buzz had gotten out about this hot spot, because the lobby was packed, so call ahead and get a reservation!  2) The zesty aromas were taunting all of us leading to a ridiculous amount of anticipation and salivation.   3) This was going to be splendid. There is no way that it wouldn't be. Yummy.   Upon being seated, we were promptly served freshly baked focaccia bread with dipping oil. There really isn't a better way to kick off an Italian feast, than a basket filled with piping hot bread!  We indulged ourselves a little and ordered the Calamari Fritta and the Zucchini Fritte. Both were served in an artful style with flavors bursting off of the plate. The Zucchini Fritte was literally gorgeous!  Now that your taste buds are yearning for more written food porn, I should take you on a journey through the entrees. When I dine out with friends, we all employ the \"family plate\" concept. We are all going to order different meals and share with each other. That being said, at the table we ordered the Chicken Marsala, Tuna Steak with Pasta (Special), Chicken Carbonara (Special), and the Short Rib Agnolotti, Without exaggeration, I can say that not only were all of the dishes oozing with goodness, they were all at the top of the Italian food chain as far as flavors go.   The marina smothered angle hair pasta that accompanied the Marsala was by far the best marinara that I have ever had the honor of eating. The creamy Carbonara sauce was sinfully rich, and the Short Rib Agnolotti was sooo unique and inventive that I can not get the taste out of my head since!   Naturally, being a full-figured gent I ordered a dessert for the table... Yup, Fried Dough! It was to die for! Fresh Pizzelles also made their way to our table, and I must say that they too topped the cake.   I give this place FIVE delicious stars! A must-eat and a pleasant escape from the Little Italy parking nightmare."}
{"text":"This is a very nice locally owned restaurant that serves Italian-American fare.  They do a great job with their take out, but the bar and the full restaurant are always busy. The food is top notch and you can really tell that it is made from scratch. The owners treat you like instant friends. I never felt like just a patron there. They do catering as well! If you are wanting real Italian food in the CLE, try this place !"}
{"text":"My workplace has enjoyed catered lunched from Piccolo twice in the last two or three months.  I must say, the food is fantastico!!   Absolutely everything we have ordered and tasted was delicious and plentiful.  The lady who delivered both times was accommodating, easy going and easy on the eyes."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant, be prepared to take home leftovers as portions are huge! So far I've tried the panzanella salad, the eggplant parm, and the lasagna. All were very tasty!"}
{"text":"Such incredible Italian food! I have eaten here so many times and I've never had a bad bite ;)   But seriously, the food is delicious and the servers are so friendly. I really love the environment."}
{"text":"I still like this restaurant, and go often for dinner. The food is great, the restaurant is attractive and clean, it always smells good, and the staff is friendly and attentive.   However, I've had the occasion to go at lunch and it is often really slow. Even if you order right away, it seems like the food comes out slowly. If you want to go for lunch, or if you are in a rush, you need to let them know you have to go."}
{"text":"Had a lunch date withy wife. Service was terrible. My wife never got her hot tea she ordered. It took over 30 minutes for our meal to come. We were never offered bread that other tables got.  Food was good. My soup was barely warm but my wife enjoyed her chicken parmigiana sandwich and the risotto croquette were great.  I heard great things so I was expecting so much more."}
{"text":"Almost missed this little gem, tucked in the midst of a little shopping center. Word on the street this boasts one powerful happy hour and had to give it a go. Promptly greeted by our hostess and directed to bar area. Place was lit and seating was a little tight (definitely had to back out your bar seat in order to get out). But oh it's worth it.  Very clean and slight upscale atmosphere without the upscale prices. Start off with some fresh crisp bread (not sure if it was ciabatta or italian) and seasoned olive oil. Takes a while for it to come out but it's always warm when it arrives.   I've been here twice now both times for the happy hour menu, everything only $5 or $6. Unique food items for happy hour (not just chicken wings or flat bread). Instead, choose from a unique calamari (a little sweet), deep fried eggplant slices doused in mozzarella and tomato sauce with basal (*fave), bowl of the pasta of the day (generous portion for just $5).   Despite the delectable happy hour prices, I always have this self obligation to get a chicken parmigiana at an italian place. This entree can feed a family. There's an additional $5 sharing fee to split the entree but they also give each person a salad and their own bowl of pasta. Even splitting the dish I still had some to take home and eat the next day. Meat was tender, pasta al dente and sauce was on point (great balance of sweet and savory).  Hard to miss a happy hour at this place with these hours:   Happy hour 4-7 Monday to Thursday  Friday and Saturday 4-6 and 9-11 All day Sunday 4-close Lunch happy hour Monday to Saturday 11:30-3:30"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant 4-5 times previously with good results. Last evening, we waited for over 1 hour for our entrees after our appetizer. Went to the manager/owner and things started to happen, two dinners came out tepid (lobster ravioli under cooked) and we waited another 5 minutes for the salmon salad. Owner removed the entrees from our bill but I was so upset and disgusted I left my meal on the table. Was a fan until yesterday, never, ever will return to this restaurant."}
