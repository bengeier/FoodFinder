{"text":"This place was fabulous. The food was so yummy. The waitress was very helpful and friendly. I can't wait to go back. Best food I have had outside of my grandma's kitchen. Absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"Food was great. Tried four different types of pierogis and also had the dessert blueberry. Take home some food from little grocery attached. Nice staff"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here..  Food is amazing but pricey for the atmosphere and the location $21.00 for lunch in Mesa is high. Hope they stick around with those prices."}
{"text":"Simple yet soooooo delicious. Authentic. Friendly staff. Very clean. Smoked sausage is hella bomb."}
{"text":"Pierogi and stuffed cabbage just like mom made! Incredible value for the $. Nice friendly atmosphere and wonderful service. Truly, eating here is like having your best family chef in the kitchen preparing you a good old fashioned, authentic home cooked meal. All five meals were perfection!"}
{"text":"We don't have many  excellent places in the area, so this was a great find. It was recommended by my colleagues who were apparently trying to keep it a secret! Excellent the pierogies of potato and onion with caramelized onion. Excellent the polish sausage. Everything home made and tasting like it.  Will be back and with any friend who comes to visit.  Suggestion: it would be great to have some homemade dessert for those of us that like to indulge."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Groupon to help me find this great new place to eat!  I grew up eating pierogies and stuffed cabbage.  The food is as authentic and delicious as it gets!  The sauerkraut was the best I've ever had.  And fruit-stuffed dessert pierogies???  Why did we never think of this back home?  For all you West Coast people who've never had this type of food, you must go here.  The only reasons I did not give it 5 starts was that we got charged dinner prices for lunch, but I did not notice this until we left.  Also, our poor server was there by himself and the restaurant was a bit busy so service was slow."}
{"text":"First off, the map on Yelp is wrong - as you can see by the address, the restaurant is on  BASELINE, not Guadalupe. Exact same corner, if you will, but one mile north of what Yelp's map shows.  Now to the good stuff - the PIEROGIs. They were excellent. Had the 6 piece sampler for my first visit: 2 each, boiled not fried, of Potato/Cheddar, Potato/Onion, Potato/Mushroom. All were very good but I think the mushroom one had the most flavor. A bit of critique would be that I would like to see more onion in the Potato/Onion pierogi. It was still tasty, but I think there could be more flavor with a bit more onion. Their plates come with sour cream or other side condiments which lends to the flavor. It took maybe 10 minutes for the food to come out which tells me they were made fresh and were not sitting there ready to be nuked to death.  The place is small but VERY clean. They have an A rating from the Board of Health proudly (and rightfully so) displayed on their front door. As an aside, why anyone would eat at a restaurant without an A rating is beyond me........  I will be back to try other flavors for sure!"}
{"text":"The best Russian/Ukrainian food in town. I am from Washington state and when I in Arizona I always visit ALL PIEROGI KITCHEN!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Brought back good memories of home.  We got there a little after two and Kristi was kind enough to seat us even though they close for a short period to prepare for dinner.  Plenty of food. Just wished I would have gotten the cake!  Picked up a nutroll at the market next door.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Any European place is better than this one. Really overpriced. Their pierogis are basically Chinese dumplings. I payed $16 for six grape-sized dumplings."}
{"text":"We were going to an event nearby on Saturday, 2/11/17, and searched for a restaurant. When I saw a locally owned non-chain eatery, I decided to give it a shot. To find an Eastern European restaurant here in the valley is rare, to find one this good, amazing. This is a Polish, Ukranian and Russian based establishment and we wanted to try the pierogies. We were a party of 4 and started out with the soups. They were amazing. Next we ordered 4 different types of pierogies and shared them. They were delicious and came with sour cream, bacon bits and caramelized onions. We had 6 each and walked away happy and full. We enjoyed it so much, we went back again on Valentine's Day.  https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31281-d5416478-r459455545-All_Pierogi_Kitchen-Mesa_Arizona.html#"}
{"text":"I would give them 5 starts but they are way overpraised for their market items. Food is good overall. But it still concerns me. If City of Mesa dose not charge sales tax for grocery . why this guys keep charging same rate taxes for food at the restaurant and same rate taxes when you buy grocery/produce at their market?"}
{"text":"Wanted to update my first review. Went back a couple months later and took my husband this time. We had just as great an experience as the first time, only he got to enjoy it also. Still had food leftover, so my daughter-in-law had lunch for the next day!"}
{"text":"The pierogi's in the restaurant are great; the frozen ones are tasty, but kind of mushy.  I ate a meal in the nice clean eating area and was so pleased I wanted to take some home.  Bought $40 worth of pierogi from the frozen refrigerator and one poppy seed roll.  I asked how long ago the roll was baked and the lady said, \"Oh, a couple of weeks ago\".  Thinking she was kidding, I came home and she's not!  That was the driest piece of pastry ever.  I've been to Poland twice, it is not a dry treat.  I wouldn't buy that again."}
{"text":"I want to start off and say the food here is pretty good. However, the price is a bit high for the food. I make my own pierogi at home, and although they are time consuming, they are probably one of the cheapest foods you can make. The smoked sausage was ok, but I've seen it packed tighter and needs more garlic. My favorite part of my main dish was the stewed saurkraut on the side. That was something to write home about! I'm definitely willing to try it again."}
{"text":"I lived in Europe and have had pierogi's in Poland, and these were excellent, especially the potato and farmers cheese.  Great service from Lulu, who hails from Polska herself, so she was most helpful with the menu.  Look forward to returning and trying some more of the menu."}
{"text":"We were anxious to try this restaurant. Pricing is a little strange and on the high side. The Pierogi's and sausage were wonderful. The restaurant was not busy at all at lunch time. We had the place to ourselves. The waitress was very attentive. Was not a fan of the dessert Pierogi's.  Definitely give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our dinner despite the rather high prices.  Restaurant was clean and comfortable.  The problem came after we left.  We purchased a poppy seed desert roll to take home.  When I went to cut it, we discovered it had mold.  Now this can happen anywhere, but when I called to market about it, they told me that I would have to return it with the itemized receipt because people don't tell the truth.  Pretty sad customer service philosophy that does not bode well for their future."}
{"text":"This place has become like a security blanket for one of my husband's new coworkers who is from Poland.  Located in the former Hippie taco place (dang that place was good too!), this place is run by a great couple with cool Polish accents. The ambience is nothing to write home about but the food makes up for it ten-fold.  Each time we visit we order combinations of different perogies and also buy some to bring home (located in their freezer).  They even have apple perogies, which imakes for a great, quick dessert at home. Recently my husband met a coworker who is from Poland. He complained that the American food was nothing like Polish food. Being a descendant of Poland, my husband brought this guy here and they now frequent it at least once per month.  Oh, and for those who don't know what a perogie is, think of a very fresh, large ravioli, stuffed with mashed potatoes or meat or apples....yummmm!"}
{"text":"We ordered the 12 pierogi plate with several different flavors. They were amazing! The only thing was that she messed up my order and I got a few I did not like. But I didn't bring it to her attention because I didn't feel it was worth complaining. Nonetheless, I definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Authentic.  It is homemade on site..  I was impressed with the authenticity and it appeared very clean.  They also have a little store.  I felt like I traveled to another country for a moment. - a little international oasis in the middle of the Mesa/Tempe border area."}
{"text":"Authentic food and great service. We actually had our reception dinner here because my wife is Russian and we wanted our guests to have authentic Russian pelmeni. It was amazing and everyone was happy. Best borscht I have ever tasted!! The staff was also very helpful for our wedding party!"}
{"text":"Omg so delicious.we tried the pork and potato cheese jalapeno perogis.bought them frozen and prepared at home.def will go back! YUM"}
{"text":"Food is amazing.  Server was the problem.  They sell sides of 3 perogis and combo plates with perogis and other things.  Coming in at lunch time, in front of all my co workers whom i was in attendance with, they refused to sell me one of their 3 perogi side dishes because it wasnt dinner time.  Because it was lunch time i had to buy the plate of 3 perogis along with other things like beef and cabbage.  The server simply didnt know how to ring it up on his tablet thing and decided to refuse my request rather than going to ask the manager how to ring up the order.  Ruined my whole experience.  Food is awesome though"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! I have tried pretty much every perogi that they have and haven't been disappointed! :)"}
{"text":"I had a surprise party to plan for my wife, and one of friends suggested getting Russian food from All Pierogi.  I called the place and explained that we needed enough food and variety for 30 people, and Natasha gave a great advice regarding quantities as well as recommendations for various dishes.  Everything turned out excellent, and everyone at the party was very pleased with food.  We are both Russian and half the people at our party were Russian - people were complimentary how great everything tasted.  Now we know where to get some great prepared Russian meals!"}
{"text":"My grandmother was from Odessa, and the pierogi taste just like I remember her varenyky."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this little place for ages but I am usually at work when they are open.  Finally today i made it in, and was very happy.   I grew up Polish, but everything from the friendly Russian cooks was just as I remember.  I tried the potato and onion, and the potato and cheddar, both lightly fried.  They were delicious!  I wish I had brought a friend, because six was not quite filling enough, but twelve would have been too much ( I don't eat meat, but if you do, you could have sausage or something else to round out the meal).  I highly recommend the cheddar and potato pierogi.  I also recommend fried, although I know boiled is probably healthier.  They offer a nice assortment of frozen take-home pierogi and Russian grocery items like candy, canned goods, etc.  They also have home-made baked goods, and I bought a package of Russian cookies that I remember my Polish mother making- very tasty and fresh.  Caution- no matter how excited you are about the cookies, do not attempt to eat powdered sugar-covered treats in the car.  You will make a mess.  Wait until you get home, then enjoy your dessert."}
{"text":"Live just a block down from the restaurant and have seen it for years.  Finally decided to stop in.  Amazing!  Grabbed lunch, but I'm going to have to come back stock up with stuff from the store."}
{"text":"I was craving some home-cooked German/Polish food, the types of lovingly prepared savory delectables I used to eat as a kid.  All Pierogi didn't disappoint.  Generous portions of homemade pierogis are the specialty here with a myriad of different fillings, served either pan fried (my fav) or boiled. We tried the sauerkraut + potato, mushroom + potato, and farmer cheese + potato, all of which were very good.  I ordered the beef stuffed cabbage roll, but they were out, so I took a chance on the pork stuffed cabbage roll.  This nicely seasoned ground pork and rice roll was large, enrobed by tender cabbage, and paired with savory tomato sauce.  Excellent!  I was quite full after eating the combo plate, but found the food so flavorful that regretted not ordering a bigger plate.  Some solace came with the purchase of a dozen pierogis from the adjacent market, which sells frozen take-away packages for $10/dozen.  We ended the meal with dessert, cookies \"Nuts\", a caramel butter filled shortbread cookie, and split the 6 two-bite cookies between the two of us, for the perfectly sized finale.  Prices were on the high side, but I was happy to pay it once I tasted the freshness and quality of  food (worth it).  I agree with other reviewers, the upcharge for trying different flavors is a little over the top, but going with one or a few others, each ordering your own and sharing curbs the uncharges."}
{"text":"We all need to support this business so it succeeds!! The owner wants to expand the cafe portion of her store. The food is delicious, pierogis fresh and homemade. The east valley needs more wonderful Eastern European food like this. I highly recommend the food here."}
{"text":"I was having a party and decided on serving Polish food.  I had lunch here the previous week and the food was just as good or better than I could make.  So I decided to order  stuffed cabbage rolls, pierogis and fresh sausage.  Natasha was wonderful; she prepared my order when I arrived and also gave me directions on how to prepare and reheat the food.  I was having a total of 17 people for dinner and they all raved about how wonderful the food was!  I would highly recommend!,  they do have a small dining area with only four tables , so if they are busy you may need to wait for a table, but it is well worth it.  I live in the northeast valley and I will gladly travel to Mesa to enjoy their wonderful food.  Thanks Natasha my party was a success because of your food!"}
{"text":"Everything here is as good as it gets and tastes just like my grandma used to make. I am a huge fan of this place!"}
{"text":"Food good. Nice people. Kind of pricey. Problem: sign credit card on their ipad or whatever electronic device they use and their agent called \"square inc.\" will capture your email address and email you a copy of the receipt containing your credit card info, transaction amount, your signature and other info WITHOUT YOU KNOWINGLY GIVING THEM THIS PERSONAL INFO! This data is obviously kept in a data base which you cannot opt out. BAD POLICY. Won't go there again for this reason."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner.  Although the pierogi don't compare to my mom or grandma's, they were still pretty good. Definitely will come back when I'm feeling homesick for pierogi or barszcz."}
{"text":"Do NOT go there hungry your first time.  We didn't know what we wanted so we ordered a little bit of everything.    Nothing we had disappointed.  My wife and I started off with a cup of Borscht.  It was plenty for both of us and was a very filling soup.  Soup had potatoes, cabbage and beets of course.   Moved on to the potato and cheese pierogies, a pork stuffed cabbage and potato pancakes.  Again we shared and there was plenty for both of us.  Unfortunately we were so full that we didn't try any of the desserts which you could smell when you walked in.  So you are wondering how did all of this taste?  It was fantastic.  That is why decided on 5 stars.  It is definitely the best in it's category.  The competition (a block to the east.) is not as good.  The service was good and the place was clean.  The other reviews covered the market next door.  We will be back and looking forward to trying other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Good food. Service was unattentive. Way overpriced for what you get. Suggestion, buy in store and cook yourself if you chose to do so. There is much better sausage and cabbage rolls at Stan's."}
{"text":"Pro:  Super-friendly waitress who was happy to help us choose our food. We shared a 6 pierogi plate with Polish sausage. Comes with small salad that was nothing memorable. Bread w herbed oil for dipping was great. I ordered wine from Bulgaria and it was good. Lots of beers from Ukraine and Poland. The cheddar potato pierogis were outstanding. The Polish sausage was very good. The biscuit cake was beautiful and tasted good.  We also purchased Russian and Polish candy and pastry in the attached market and took that home.    Con:  Only one waitress. There had been a second one but she left mid-way through. I heard her excuse herself from the next table. Waited a long time to get a dessert menu and pay our bill. There wasn't even a busboy or hostess so the one waitress was doing everything.  I get the feeling this is a converted Chinese restaurant. The tables and chairs don't  seem to fit the European theme and the floor tiles are just dated and gross.  They do not fit the theme at all.  The lighting is pretty. Overall, there was just a bit of a stark feeling to the decor."}
{"text":"Wow- this is the place to go for great Polish food! I went with several family members and we shared lots of amazing and delicious choices. Beet salad, pierogis of all kinds, fresh polish sausage, beef and pork golumbki (we chose creamy sauce instead of the typical tomato sauce and loved it)! I am not a wine snob at all and the house white wine was enjoyable. Another person at my table got potato pancakes and a great soup with dill in it that he loved. In addition they have a market connected to the restaurant so we loaded up with frozen pierogi to take home along with Polish candy, polish sausage and various assorted other goodies. We are planning to return soon. An added pleasure was the accordion player who serenaded us during our meal. It was just a perfect evening!"}
{"text":"Tried this for Sunday lunch and it was perfect! From the pierogi to the sandwich everything was good. For desert the plum pierogi were delicious!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Russian potato salad as well as the potato and farmer's cheese pierogi.   The cabbage roll was really awesome. Juicy and moist. The place is small but clean.  Dining room is somewhat cramped but colorful.  They do sell a a large number of goods to make at home as well.  I will be back to try other dishes.  Give this place a shot."}
{"text":"0-3 stars for food quality 0-2 stars for service  Staff greeted everyone very nicely, even though it was busy, they all were kind and highly professional when it came to customer service.   They pumped through the line and answered all of my questions as I have never had a perogi before.   They gave accurate waiting times, 10 minutes, to everyone that was there.   I got the sausage plate with a beef, chicken, and pork perogi. They also make their own fresh seurcrout.   Their soda machine didn't have ice.  I said it was OK but the soda pretty warm too   The Polish sausage was well packed and tight.  But it was not seasoned well  The dough was well boiled and seared on 1 side.   The filling of all 3 was quite bland.   2 -  food would have gotten a 3 if it was seasoned and if they had ice 2 -  staff was amazing"}
{"text":"One of the few good polish restaurants around Phoenix, with great pierogi and smoked kielbasa.  But that is about all you will get in selection, so don't look for much other stuff.  Pierogi choices are good, and they are filled well and flavorful."}
{"text":"Excellent homemade Polish food, just like your Nana made.  Service is wonderful, food is ready quickly.  The owner cannot do enough for you.  While running around doing different chores, she is asking if we need anything, asking if the food is good and asking if we need anything.   Enjoy.  Be shure to gi and have an excellent time."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Amazing food! Even greater service! Definitely coming back for my Pierogi fix;) the portions were quite big so the two of us couldn't finish the dinner."}
{"text":"Wow. I've only had eastern European food once before.  This was way better. Can't believe they are in Mesa. I got the cabbage roll dinner that comes with 6 peirogi's of your choice. I got the cabbage & mushroom ones. My wife got potato & mushroom ones.  It came with bread & oil. And a small salad each.  Dang good is all I can say. If you are wanting something different but excellent tasting then hi-tail it over here."}
{"text":"A hidden gem.  Our first time visiting for lunch.  I think the lovely restaurant addition is new and the original store is next door. Never had Pierogi before and can't imagine them being more delicious than these.  I had the potato and onion and my husband had the smoked sausage plate.   Melt in your mouth delicious and very reasonably priced. Can't wait to return and try other items"}
{"text":"Better than the pierogi festival we went to  in Boston with my wife's Polish relatives  who make them at home, worth the trip. We'll be back !   My wife loved how clean the place was."}
{"text":"To be completely honest, the moment bf and I pulled into the plaza we both looked at each other simultaneously and silently agreed the location looked a bit sketchy, but we are so glad we went in. The food was delicious, our waitress Ina was the sweetest lady and kept checking on us, and at tonight's dinner someone was playing the accordion. It was quite romantic. It started getting pretty busy in there as the night went on. I would say the patrons tonight were half couples on a date and half family with children. Had a great time."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced even with the Groupon. I'm Russian myself and grew up eating pierogis. These just tasted kind of.. funny. Not at all how pierogis are supposed to taste. My wife thought the same thing. I had higher expectations for this place, but there are very few eastern European restaurants in Arizona. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is the place where I can enjoy really delicious authentic Russian/Ukrainian food. I absolutely loved their juicy pelmeni."}
{"text":"It's very rare that I leave a restaurant and feel inclined to leave a review right away, however, I really wanted to make an exception today. This place is a true hidden gem. It is located on a nondescript plaza with another restaurant and a smoke shop. When you walk inside, the decorations are very simple but inviting.   Now, the food. Being from a Russian family, I have eaten a lot of Russian and Ukrainian food. My husband is a maniac for borscht. So he ordered a sandwich with a borscht on the side and I got cheddar and potatoes pierogi. I'm a big fan of cabbage pierogis in general but I decided to change it up today. He got his borscht with sour cream and dill already in it (that's how borscht was meant to be eaten). He was so excited that I decided to give it a try. It was damn delicious. Tasted homemade and FRESH. His sandwich had kielbasa in it and was sooo good- crispy bread just made that sandwich. I had the pierogis which I really enjoyed. I got pan fried which were delicious. The flavors were out of the park- onions were a great compliment to the dish. And bacon...well who doesn't love bacon? Service was fantastic- the young lady was attentive and quick to refill. I'm already planning on my next trip here."}
{"text":"Are you craving pierogis? All Pierogi Kitchen is the place to go to fulfill that craving! The pierogis were authentic, made fresh in house, and filling. Every bite was deliciousness. All of the pierogis tasted good and we even recommend trying out the dessert pierogis. On the outside, the building looked sketchy but we were glad we weren't deterred away. The restaurant inside was clean and had a homey vibe. The service was attentive and friendly and we recommend checking out the market attached to the restaurant."}
{"text":"We love European food, and pierogis and meat pelmeni tasted exactly the way they are supposed to!  My kid said everything tasted \"100% awesome.\"  He is a picky eater, so that's quite a compliment! :)  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bardzo dobrze! I was skeptical because it's hard to find good Polish food in Arizona. And I'm critical because I make my own pierogi, so...  We had lunch at All Pierogi. I was pleasantly surprised and happy they are in Mesa (not Phoenix).  It's Tuesday, so sauerkraut pierogi were the special pierogi of the day. I had the kielbasa and sauerkraut on toasted rye with spicy mustard. The kielbasa was very good...the whole sandwich was very good.  Came with a side salad of mixed vegetables or potato salad. I got the side salad. I wish I hadn't felt so full, as I would have loved to try the dessert pierogi (cherry, apple/cinnamon, blueberry, etc)  ! I love that they have a little store adjoining the restaurant with a lot of Polish and Ukrainian foods and they make the pierogi and bake bread onsite.  Great little place. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been buying my pierogis here now for only a few months and they are delicious! Today we tried the Apple and Cinnamon pierogis, and I have to say, my taste buds have never been happier!  So far I've loved the potato and cheese mostly, but this one just tops it all! Love this place! Will keep coming back for whenever I have a hankering for their deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little Russian Polish restaurant, great pierogies and excellent service!  We enjoyed the live music on a Friday night too."}
{"text":"I am Soo happy to find this little place!  I am from Chicago and before finding this place I would go all the way to Phoenix and this place has fresh pierogi 's !  I will he back for lunch soon!  :).  The staff is great :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! Awesome food, great beer and wine! Totally worth a visit, but I already love kielbasa, Pierogies and potato pancakes!"}
{"text":"Extremely Complex.  No simple orders here.  Nickel and dime for everything.  Charge extra for everything.  Canned soda. No refills.  Not nice.  Nice restaurant. Very clean.  Good food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem! The food is all made from scratch (not false advertising!). Get adventure for the beer enthusiast as well, many different choices from overseas."}
{"text":"I can't say the pierogies here are bad, they're not bad.  They're just massively over priced.  The whole menu is WAY expensive.  I will say the borscht was unlike any borscht I've ever had before, and that was not so good.  I guess I'm spoiled in that when I go to eat at any Eastern European ethnic place, I expect to be FED and fed inexpensively (or at least reasonably).  My grandpa would have been yelling at somebody here for sure.  I'm not going to yell, I'm just disappointed.  I love pierogies and borscht.  I was really looking forward to dinner here, and I was really hoping this would be a local spot to get my fix.  But it is apparently not to be.  If I return, it'll be to buy a jar a brine pickles in their shop next door.  The shop is pretty cool, you should have a look around.  I'd skip the restaurant though.  Its disappointing."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant out today and I really enjoyed their selection of pierogis.  I had the farmer's cheese, potato and cheese, and cabbage pierogi, as well as a cup of Borscht soup.  I liked that you are able to choose if you prefer your pierogi fried or boiled.  These reminded me of my Grandma's pierogi that she used to make when I was a kid.  Our waitress was friendly and our lunch came out fast.  I would highly recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"If you want to taste true eastern european cuisine you have to try this place. Absolutely delicious! From appetizers to desert. This is a lovely little place with welcoming and friendly stuff. The borscht was fresh and stuffed cabbage was delicious! They serve Baltika beer, which I highly recommend for the full Russian experience. Going here was like taking a trip to my russian grandma's. This spot is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Coming from a Polish family I grew up on a lot of Polish food. Pierogis (various filled thin noodle pocket), golumkies (beef stuffed cabbage rolls), kielbasa (smoked sausage). I had it often as a kid. At no time in my life was there any restaurant that had that same food cooked even remotely close to good. Until we came across All Pierogi Euro Kitchen.  My husband and I walk into an extremely clean and simple eatery with wood tables and chairs. We sat down and the waitress was very busy and very nice. She gave us the menus. I was amazed at all of the items that they had to offer. Especially all the different types of Pierogi. She took our order and went off to the kitchen. The place was pretty busy for an early Friday night.  We got our drinks and soon got our salads. The plates were nice and cold and the salad was also cold and crisp. It was dressed with a light oil/vinegar mix. She also brought some home made bread with oil and salt/pepper to eat with the salad. The bread was warm and fresh. The oil was a little light for my taste, but it went well with the salad.  Then we almost immediately received our entrees. I got the kielbasa with pierogi and latkas (potato pancakes). My husband got the kielbasa, golumkie, pierogi, with a side of sauerkraut. The kielbasas were long, thick and flavorful. The golumkie was HUGE. Had a nice light tomato sauce on it. The latkas were perfectly cooked and seasoned. But the best part, by far were those super fresh, pan fried pierogis. Oh my gosh! Cut them up, added some sour cream, some of the side of bacon and onions. Wow. They just melted in my mouth. It has been YEARS since I had such bliss. These were the best pierogi's I have ever had. And I have had quite a few in my day. Highly highly HIGHLY recommend the pierogis.  Our portions were big so we could not Finnish everything in one sitting. Our drinks were readily attended to and our waitress was taking really good care of us. I noticed they had desert pierogis, but I was too full to try them. Next time. We got our check and for the two of us and all that food we hit about $50.   If you are craving an amazing home cooked old fashioned Polish style meal where the temperatures were perfect, the flavors were amazing and the staff was very nice, go here. I will return here soon."}
{"text":"I grew up eating stuffed cabbage and homemade pierogis from my grandmas kitchen and that is exactly what I got from the All Pierogi Kitchen!  It was delicious! Perfect pierogis (boiled) and the stuffed cabbage (beef) was just like grandmas.  I couldn't have been happier with the service either, very kind and patient.  I will definitely be back and can't wait to take my grandma here when she comes to visit.  I want to try a lot more of the shop items, I only got an ice cream bar and it was crazy delicious too.  Very very happy with this completely authentic kitchen!"}
{"text":"I recently went here with two friends that enjoy Ukrainian food. I don't know how to spell or pronounce anything on the menu but the service was great. Our waitress was very on top of everything and helpful. This was my first time trying this style of food and it was great. I had some sort of pasta filled with potatoes and bacon. I recommend trying that for a first timer.  The reason I left four stars was just because it's not exactly my style of food. I'm sure it's excellent to anyone who knows and prefers that regions food."}
{"text":"All Pierogi Kitchen is what I'd expect from a local mom & pop restaurant ... And actually, it's not much of a restaurant as much as a little shop. They have a small area with about 4 or 5 tables, a small counter to place orders, & a freezer with pierogies made up to go. When we went in, I ordered the chicken pierogies & the potato pierogies with sour cream. They asked if I'd like them prepared boiled or pan fried - I said pan fried. I definitely was not a fan of how oily they came out. It took some time to get our order, which was actually a good thing b/c we could see a lady making the pierogies fresh in the kitchen. They were served on paper plates. I'd say that overall, the experience was rather disappointing."}
{"text":"All Pierogi Kitchen is one of the best Eastern European restaurants in Arizona.   They serve fresh, handmade, homestyle dishes. Each option is full of flavor and very filling.  I always choose the sampler. It includes a cabbage roll (you can't go wrong with either meat or either sauce), 6 pierogi of your choice, smoked or fresh kielbasa and sauerkraut. Included is a small house salad plus bacon, onions & sour cream. It never fails to satisfy.  Pierogi are the star of the show, however, and you have a huge selection. The standard cheese & potato are always popular. But, you can get other options: beef, pork, sauerkraut, farm cheese, bacon & potato. My personal favorite is the jalapeno & cheddar. They have the same great taste and texture of the original but the spicy, smokey flavor of jalapenos is a great addition. You can have your pierogi pan fried or boiled.  The restaurant had a good selection of wines and beers from Eastern Europe and many are good. For an interesting drink get a shot of the pepper honey vodka... it's like alcoholic ginger ale with a kick.  The desert menu has sweet & fruity choices of pierogi. They are fun and yummy, but nothing beats the savory options. Get a couple flavors to share.  The restaurant has a small deli next door. They have premade choices that you can take home & boil for a quick, easy and delicious meal. They also have the best smelling kielbasa you will find...it is hard to get it home without taking a bite.  A meal at All Pierogi Kitchen doesn't dissapoint. Stop in for a delicious dinner."}
{"text":"Got there around 730. No wait we were seated immediately.  Staff was very friendly and our server was very knowledgeable of the menu.  If your looking for something out of the ordinary and are familiar with pierogies then I implore you to give This place a try as you will not be disappointed in the least bit. We stated with a salad sampler, 3 of which we've never had and all were delicious.  My wife ordered Farmers cheese pierogies, potato cakes, and smoked kielbasa,  while I  had farmers cheese and potato pierogies, fresh sausage, and sauerkraut stew. We were not disappointed in the least bit. But wait there's more.  There is a Russian, Ukrainian store attached to the restaurant that you can purchase pierogies, sausages, kielbasa, and various other Russian, Ukrainian, and Polish authentic foods. I simply could not leave with out a ring of blood sausage.  Step out of the norm and give it a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Pierogis are amazing. The fresh sausage is authentic and delicious. Relaxed atmosphere. Great place."}
{"text":"So this place is my source for pelmeni. And pierogies. This place actually makes them fresh so it's not like when you go to some Russian store wherever and you have to wonder how many years that stuff's been sitting around in the freezer before you actually picked it up and bought it. Anyway I prefer the store to the restaurant because the last time I came here for lunch with a bunch of friends the place was packed - every table occupied but there was only one server. ONE GUY FOR THE ENTIRE FREAKING RESTAURANT! What kind of XPEH is that? Needless to say our food took forever to arrive and then paying our bill took forever. At least the guy had a portable credit card reader or we'd have been there another hour. Not that the food wasn't good - we just don't have an endless lunch hour. Atmosphere? Um... sure... they played nothing but Okean Elzy the entire hour we were there. It's ok though - I still come and stock up on their pelmeni from the store every now and then. Freshest in town! So the stars are for the store not the PECTOPAH. Plenty of parking - it's in a mall on the southwest corner of Baseline and Alma School."}
{"text":"Totally authentic Pierogi!! I got the combo plate, with potato and cheddar pan fried pierogi and a beef cabbage roll. It did NOT disappoint. Everything was so tasty and filling!! My friend got the kielbasa and it was the best kielbasa I've ever tasted!! I had to buy some in the market after to take home! Another friend got the pork meatballs - they were huge!! And very delicious.   The bread and oil they provide before the meal was very fresh and very good. The side salads are fantastic too!!   I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an authentic experience! I will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Today was the first time I have been here, and I was very pleased! The food was fresh, hot, and wonderful! My husband and I tried a bit of everything, and we fully intend on returning! We are also excited about the deli items we purchased!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out for something  different to eat. The waitress was very friendly and the food was excellent. We even bought some pierogies home from their market. We will be back to try some other flavors of piergories."}
{"text":"My theme for this visit to the valley this time around has been find restaurants that have a different kinds of food that I usually haven't eaten in years. My wife and I were looking for perogies. Pierogi Euro Kitchen has a wonderful array of perogies, potato pancakes and other dishes from Europe and Russia. We had the potato and cheddar perogies pan fried. They come with onions, sour cream and bacon on the side. The potato pancakes comes with apple sauce and sour cream on the side. Both were excellent. Your meal starts with Hollie Bread  and a small salad which were both tasty. This is comfort food at its finest. Thank you fellow Yelper's for this gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to get pierogies. I come in and pick up the frozen batches to take home, once I am ready to eat they are so easy and quick to make and taste fresh. Love love love the potato and cheese but the beef is my favorite!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to help break out of the cookie cutter chain restaurant rut. The food was amazing.  The potato pancakes were some of the best I have ever had.Service was fair to good. Restaurant is cute."}
{"text":"Pierogi just the way grandma used to make! Good smoked sausage, but not real garlicky.  Stuffed cabbage was very flavorful."}
{"text":"This is a pretty respectable Polish restaurant. I'm Polish, so I kind of know what I like in regards to Polish food. I like the kielbasa and the cabbage. I also ordered the pork stuffed cabbage with tomato sauce. I will order the beef ones next time, I thought the pork one was a little bland. The Pierogis were respectable. I had the sauerkraut and mushroom fried ones because I'm a sauerkraut fanatic. These were good. I thought they could stuff them fuller though.  The dessert Pierogis were also good. A little too much dough for my liking, but tasty nonetheless. We ordered the cherry, blueberry and sweet cheese ones. My sister loved the cheese ones while I favored the cherry ones. I have to say though, the menu is tough to figure out. My 91 yr. old Mother felt overwhelmed by it and needed help figuring it out . Thankfully the waitress was patient and helped us all out. It is rather expensive to eat there because there may not be a platter that appeals to everyone so you end up paying a la Carter prices. Our meal for 4 people was $137.00 before tip. We all had dessert and only 1 person had 1 alcoholic beverage."}
{"text":"Serendipity! Going to a nearby eatery noticed the \"pierogi\" part of the sign and detoured to it: so glad we did! But the pierogis! Delicious potato/onion pierogi daily special, sausage plate with fresh, not smoked kielbasa and potato/sauerkraut pierogi. And the salad sampler. But the pierogis! All were obviously freshly made and yummy. And an impressive number of Polish and other Slavic beers to try: Even satisfied our one picky beer drinker. But the pierogis! And try the never before seen Russian \"moonshine\" from the bar. But the pierogis! This is the real Polish deal, go and enjoy! Na Zdrowie!"}
{"text":"Entered the business and there are only 4 tables to sit at. It seems to be more of a grocery store than restaurant. I expected it to be small, but not that small. Anyways we still sat down to eat.  Upon entering, the one and only worker had answered the phone. After taking a carryout order for 6-8 minutes we finally got to order. He was nice though and acknowledged us waiting.   Each order of food cost $10.88. I got potato and onion and potato and cheddar pierogis with sauerkraut and polish sausage. It came with crumbled bacon, onions, and sour cream (watery). The initial sour cream we got in small solo cups was warm. Got new ones that were cold but still had a watery consistency.   The sauerkraut did not have any sour bite to it. It was below average. The polish sausage was also flavorless. The potato and cheddar pierogis are pretty good. Overall though i was not impressed. I would not be back. See photos for more details.  Tip:  We recently found and have been buying the Kasia's brand Pierogi's from Sprout's. (They are in the freezer case near the deli.) If you thaw them out in the fridge and then fry a half pound of bacon half way. Then put the Pierogi's in and finish cooking the bacon and Pierogi's! Those are amazing especially with some sour cream."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, a few months after they opened, the food was amazing. Fast forward to October of 2015, the pierogis and galumpki were much smaller and the flavor was meh! For the price, I would expect authentic flavor and descent portions. Too bad they decided money (the bottom line) was more important than repeat customers. I'm Polish and I won't be back"}
{"text":"Amazing sausage and amazing peirogis! Ordered a sampler here on a whim and was glad I did. Will definitely be making more stops here."}
{"text":"Best service. Best food. Best experience. We just happened to stumble upon this location shortly after it opened and have been die hard fans ever since. To be honest,  we appreciate the lunch hour bracket far more than the dinner simply for the amazing sandwiches that they throw together as well as the daily pierogi specials offered. We would love it if they opened up their time frame or had none at all. Other than that, we've got no complaints.  Except maybe, please open up a location in the Ahwatukee foothills so that we could avoid the traffic ;-)"}
{"text":"What started as a simple homework assignment to visit a local independently owned restaurant, turned into a life changing experience. I went to the All Pierogi Euro Kitchen & Market with my sister and nephew for dinner.   All Pierogi Euro Kitchen opened in 2010 while the Euro Market did not open until 2012. They are located on Alma School and Baseline in Mesa, Arizona. They are open Wednesday through Sunday from 11 am - 2:30 pm and 4:30 - 9pm. It is a quaint restaurant, a hole-in-the-wall type establishment with a casual environment and very homey décor. All are welcome to eat here and as for a bar, it did not look to be so but they did sell kvas. Kvas are fermented rye bread drinks. They serve European cuisine with a menu that has many options to choose from. The menu was printed papers put inside of protective covers to avoid liquid and food stains.   We chose this restaurant because we were raised making hundreds of pierogi every year for the holidays and have never had them anywhere else. Left believing Babci (great-grandmother) and Jaja's (great-grandfather) pierogi were number 1, and don't get me wrong they will always be number 1 in my heart but, the food in this establishment is beyond words.  We started off with simple iced tea, they came in great glassware, very pretty and it tasted good. We also ordered a cherry bottled Euro Sparkling Juice, It was Bandi brand, basically a Euro style Jones' Soda. IT WAS AMAZING! I know they didn't have to make it or anything but it was worth mentioning because it really rounded out the meal! They also come in Apple and Pear.   After this delectable discovery, we were presented with a complimentary homemade bread plate and a side of salt and peppered olive oil to dip in. WOW. That's really all you can say, it was homemade bread. Just, wow. We loved it. Then my sister got her soup, the reddest borscht I have ever seen! Smells amazing and tastes even better. I think they put potatoes in it, and I've never done that but I will now! We also got the house salad, it comes with the combo meals. An easy and lite cabbage salad with a nice vinaigrette topped with fresh feta cheese. Those were great too.  While my sister was busily demolishing her soup, our waitress brought out our giant plates. My eyes lit up! The plating was just plain art. It was a beautiful thing to behold. All the colors were bright and popped on the white plates. My sister ordered the Beef Plate, it included a ground beef cabbage roll topped with homemade tomato sauce, 6 pierogi, she chose potato and cheese but you have choice of several types of fillings. They even served the pierogi with sour cream, perfectly caramelized onions and bacon. I ordered the Smoked Sausage plate that had a huge smoked polish sausage, 6 pierogi, also potato and cheese, and a cute sauerkraut medallion.  There are not words to describe exactly how good this food was. It was definitely authentic. The food was prepared exactly how my family has made it for generations.  The pierogi are perfectly cooked lite and thick and rich all at the same time. They melt in your mouth and make you crave every bite! The sauerkraut wasn't bitter or dry but moist and smooth. The cabbage roll itself was absolutely to die for. Definitely one of the best I've had my entire life. And that is before you add on the tomato sauce. I've had homemade tomato sauce before and it always has either an odd flavor or it is just too tomatoey but this one, was just perfection. My sister cleared the bowl and used the bread, her pierogi and the sausage to make sure every bit was gone. She claims she couldn't just leave it there. When we thought we couldn't eat another bite our hands started moving on their own. It became an addiction. We thought we were going to explode eating that much food because we ordered enough food to feed at least 4 people. We just could not stop!  However, you can't properly review a restaurant without trying the dessert so, we got the Honey Cake. It's an odd thing to see, and an interesting thing to eat. It is super dense and heavy but the taste is almost lemony and of course you get the honey in there too. You mix it with the chocolate syrup they decorate your plate with and boy is it scrumptious. It probably lasted 5 minutes before that plate was cleared.   By this time though, we could not possibly eat another bite. It was fantastic, a true experience that we will not forget. We will definitely be back here again and again. THANK YOU!  -Rebecca & Erica"}
{"text":"Who said Arizona doesn't have good food?? This place rocks! First, it's adorable...even if it is in a strip mall....it's Arizona, what isn't in a strip mall?!  We had several pierogis and a park cabbage roll. The sauerkraut pierogi was amazing!!! The pork cabbage roll was flavorful, tender and exactly what grandma used to make...just order it! The sweet pierogi were nice for dessert. We had plum and apple. Overall it's tasty & fun. We particularly liked seeing the \"pierogi brigade\" in the back room. A group of older women from all over Eastern Europe were hand making the pierogi. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Great staff, food and service.Wide variety of different Pierogi's. Very authentic, good service and traditional. Very few places to choose from that offer eastern European/Russian food in Phoenix and its surrounding cities. Great to have this option close by."}
{"text":"Such a flavorful cabbage roll (beef) and the farmer's cheese pierogis (boiled) tasted just like the ones my grandpa would cook from the Polish deli in Chicago!  I will order this exact dish again next time! My fiance ordered the kielbasa dish and fried potato cheddar pierogis.  We can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"The best Pierogi's in the west. I felt like I was in Europe. Amazing, that you for the wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Amazingly great. Best cabbage rolls and pierogis!!!  Great service!  Will definitely come back.  These are true authentic pierogis!!!!"}
{"text":"Very sad I really thought it was going to be different.   The salad sampler included two bagged lettuce salad with 2 dressings.   The lettuce was pay expiration there were black slimy pieces.  $4 coffee was unremarkable.  I waited for my latkes.  I guess to get them out of the freezer.   The dill soup way to salty.   The pork meatballs were good but the mushroom sauce tasted like a dry pre mix or condensed mushroom soup.   I'll go back because I have a Yelp coupon and try the perogies.  No high expectations they sell frozen bagged ones in the market area."}
{"text":"Interesting little place. It's somewhat un expecting from the road.  It's nothing special inside but clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Attached is a tiny market that carries some frozen take home items, candies, baked goods and a mish mash of things. I had to buy a couple boxes of chocolate covered jellies. Cherry and blueberry. Yum!  The restaurant has a lot of sausages, cabbage rolls, cabbage dishes, pierogi dishes, stews, and even some interesting wines.  I had the borsch, my first, and it was great. I really enjoyed it. I also had a cabbage salad. It had a slight sweet taste, but I really liked it. I'm not sure how quickly I'll come back, but I will try it again for sure."}
{"text":"This is a really nice place. The pirogue are delish. I got one of their large plates. I didn't think the additional food was the best and wish I had gone with the all pirogue plate like my friend did. They offer some coupons for checking in online which are great offers and offset the high price. Still think it was worth it. The authentic Russian and Ukrainian beers are also really nice deals as well. Would recommend and go again. The service was great and the waitress was very accommodating of the large group that I brought with me that night. They split our checks."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, I'm Ukrainian and the pierogis reminded me of my Baba's cooking. They were busy but the service was still prompt and friendly. Ambiance was really cute too.  My only issue and reason for knocking off 1 star is that it's wayyyyy overpriced.  I just did not feel the value for the money was there. I believe It's around $18-$25 for most of the entree plates. I understand pierogis are labor intensive to make but that is just crazy for something made from dirt cheap ingredients - flour, potato, and onion. $20+ per plate is what you would pay for salmon or steak at some restaurants. For that reason I probably won't be back. For two small cups of borscht soup, 2 beers and 2 entree plates our total for dinner was $76. I did use the 20% off yelp offer but probably wouldn't go back and pay full price."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a must go-to for Pierogis! My family and I had dinner here this evening and we had great food and service. Food portions are decent size and they have a small kids menu which includes Mac and cheese or small serving of Pierogi. Handful of flavors to choose from and don't forget a good selection of European beers. Come on a Friday or Saturday evening and there will be a live musician playing the accordion. Make reservations for a large party for sure!  I tried the meatball and Pierogi plate and it was delicious! The market connected to the restaurant is also a great find."}
{"text":"yummy potato pancakes and sauerkraut and potato pierogis. These two Polish girls ate it all!"}
{"text":"We have ordered a couple times through Grub Hub and the pierogis are SOOOOO GOOOOOOD.  There is a very large selection and we always enjoy the meal.  We will definitely have to visit and sit down.  I'm also anxious to see their market so we can make some things at home as well.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and extremely authentic. If you want a taste of Russia this is a place to experience it. The only reason for four stars is the ambience."}
{"text":"Thanks to an International Supper Club UYE organized by the fabulous Monica O., I was able to give this restaurant a try. The dining area next to the store area is spacious and the food was scrumptious. There's a good variety of pierogis offered and it was not an easy choice, but I decided to get the bacon and potato perogis; they were tasty and stick-to-the-ribs filling. I also loved the cabbage roll and I know that I'll be ordering one (or several) during my next visit. Service was friendly and my only grouse is that it could have been faster, but then I understand; we were quite a large group that came at the peak of the busy dinner period and the quality of the food made it obvious that the kitchen took care in its preparation."}
{"text":"As a Pole who grew up in a city with a lot of Polish heritage, I was no stranger to perogis, but they were usually of the frozen variety - my family didn't make them and there were few Polish restaurants to offer them. Apparently I had to travel to the other side of the country to a very un-European city to find a place that not only specializes in them, but knocks it out of the park.  There's nothing crazy about perogis - they're just a dumpling by another name - so the key to All Pierogi's success is in making them from scratch. Even most of the fillings are pretty traditional - lots of potato, sauerkraut, and soft cheese - so it's really all in the finesse of the dough and the careful cooking. Pan fried is obviously the more indulgent way to go, but they give you the option of boiling them in the traditional manner, too. There's a few other European specialties on the menu, but when your name is All Pierogi, it's pretty clear what your bread and butter should be. I loved it!"}
{"text":"Wow! Such a great place to get polish food! A friend invited us out to dinner, chose this restaurant and said it's the only place he eats out at. High praises and it's all true! Everything was fresh, hot and delicious! Food came out surprisingly fast, despite the slow service and full restaurant. Treated myself to their potato and sausage plate and boy is it filling! It was a good amount of food for only $20. Definitely a place to go if you want smoked sausage and amazing pierogis!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service. We'll be back. Having never had Polish/Ukrainian/Russian food, this was a first. I had the lunch special (6 pierogi); my Irish husband had the potato pancakes. We both loved what we had and the waitress also said she loved the food there."}
{"text":"I've never had a beef pierogi untill eating here and it was very good.  The other varieties I tried where also very good.  The stuffed cabbage was also tasty, but the sausage was a bit dry.  Overall I will be coming back for more.   Be prepared to wait for good home cooked food."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try pierogis for a long time.  Finally we had the opportunity because of the International Supper Club.  We had a huge turn out, so our table had about 15 people.  Even though we were so many and each paying separate bills, the wait staff was very nice.  My husband and I decided to try the 12 piece platter, since you can choose them in 3s, we decided to try the potato and cheddar, jalapeño and cheddar, chicken and farmers cheese and potato. We chose to have them pan fried instead of boiled.  Everything is better fried, don't you think?  The platter came with sour cream, bacon bits and caramelized onions.  The pierogis were delicious,  I washed them down with a European Sparkling Pear Juice.  So yummy.  We also ordered dessert, we had the 6 pierogis 3 apple and 3 sweet farmers cheese and poppyseed roll.  The sweet farmers cheese ones were not my cup of tea, but I didn't pick them, so I was fine with only trying a corner.  We will definitely want to come back.  We were going to take some home from the market next door, but we decided to hang out with some friends after, so we didn't want the pierogis to melt.  Next time I will bring them home."}
{"text":"I visited this area restaurant on recent Saturday evening. A very delightful and delicious visit. The Borscht soup is a wonderful appetizer, the Potato Pancake pierogi platter tantalizing in its taste and spices. It was an enjoyable supper. A must \"check this out\" is their Euro Market..I was able to find some condiments from the past that where thought extinct. Russian mustard, Eastern European spices and a plethora of Pierogis to tickle the palate.  A fun place to visit, Eastern European music and ambience, helpful staff, ask all the questions you wish and you will be educated in the delights of this speciality cuisine.........in Mesa, AZ."}
{"text":"Recently moved here from Michigan, where we would go to Hamtramck at least once a month for pierogis, and the ones we had at All Pierogi were just as good!  While the prices are a little higher than we are used to paying for this type of food, it's definitely worth it. We also tried the meatballs with mushroom gravy, and they were fantastic as well!"}
{"text":"Today was a half day at work for me, since I was getting over a cold and tried to come back one day too early. But coming here to pickup a few things was just the tonic.   You see, a few months ago this Peroggi place had a small tragedy. Again I was on my way home and decided to make a quick stop. Seems all of their new A/C units upfront had gone on the fritz. The only food items they could salvage were now safely in their refrigeration units in the back.   Understanding their emergency, I offered to buy a few items and make it up to them. Well, one of the owners was glad I stopped by and I drove off with $50 worth of goodies.   So having finished off our supply of Pierogies and Kielbasa, I came back today to restock our home freezer. As others have noted, this is only a small deli with four tables. They have food items that they'll prepare for you in the back, but God help it if more than eight customers decide to come here for lunch. LOL  Well that would not be a problem for me, I was here to shop and go.  As entered I could see three woman in the back making some Pierogies by hand. That's how fresh things are here. They make the typical potato and cheddar ones, along with onions, bacon and et cetra.  We have never had a bad one.    Everything is excellent.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pierogi's, who knew it was a thing. I didn't know what to expect because I've never tried them before. Basically it's a European pot sticker with mashed potatoes and what ever else you can imagine to combine. This restaurant serves about twenty different kinds. Everything was very fresh and good tasting. Service was excellent and the restaurant was very clean. We went on a Saturday night and got to enjoy live music. Had a good time. I'm sure if your in the mode to try a little something different give this place a go."}
{"text":"This place made my day!  I had the fried cabbage perogi, which was delicious.  Another piece of yum was the simple sour cream based fried crunchy.  The powdered sugar made it just sweet enough.  The main pierogi plate for me though was the potato and mushroom with caramelized onions and sour cream on top.   perfection!   Like the kind I loved getting in the Rusky neighborhoods of NYC.  Fantastic service.  Clean locale, limited seating, but its to simple to take something to go.  My only wish is that the cherry varenikis were a menu item."}
{"text":"Wow...how did I not know that this place existed before this weekend?  We came in for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience.  I enjoyed 6 potato and sauerkraut pierogis with a pork cabbage roll - the portions were huge, the food was beyond authentic and so tasty and it was so filling.  Our server was very nice and helped make some recommendations and the food came out promptly after ordering.  I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for quality, made from scratch, authentic Eastern European food!"}
{"text":"Come to get your Ukrainian fix of sausages, perogies and cabbage rolls.  There are lots of Ukrainian goodies and so you won't be disappointed. The staff are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Very tasty pierogis. Different than how I make them or my family makes them but still tasty. Also ordered stuffed cabbage. It was huge. Loaded and flavorful. I love the new expansion of the restaurant. I wish they had fountain sodas and not just cans. I would like to see more traditional desserts. Otherwise well worth trying."}
{"text":"I went here with 2 friends and I have to say right off I am not a Pierogi connoisseur, so I am not an expert. One friend has had homemade Slovakian Pierogi's so that was their comparison and the other friend compared these Pierogi's to Polish ones. The place is really small to eat in. They have 2 tables with 4 chairs and 2 tables with 2 chairs. There is also a small grocery store if you will, within the eating place or vice versa. There is  7 shelves with dry goods for sale and a refrigerated section with Pierogi's and candies. They give you a small portion of onions and sour cream, but we did not know you could ask for more until a \"girl\" maybe the owner? came around and asked if everything was ok. If you are use to Ukraine Pierogi's than this is the place."}
{"text":"I had a Restaurant.com certificate to use here and boy was it a great decision! I ordered 16 pierogis, spicy carrots (which weren't, but tasty anyway), dill pickles (excellent and generous portion for a side), and poppy seed roll (which said a slice but I received two!). The pierogis were excellent and pan-fried, I tried: potato, potato and onion, potato and mushroom, sauerkraut and potato and sauerkraut. This place is legit, not to mention that the family is  from Europe by the thick accent I heard from the mom and (I assume) kid exchanging words during my purchase. Can't wait for next time!"}
{"text":"My Polish Grandmother would be impressed!!  Great food, friendly service.  Stop by the grocery store next door to take home some frozen pierogis and other great options when you can't get back to the restaurant soon."}
{"text":"I have only been here once, but it was delicious! I am planning many return back, but unfortunately Polish food doesn't fit too well with my healthy eating plan ;). In all seriousness, the people that run this place were very nice, and I had the crepes which were very good. Perfectly made. When I ordered I said I wanted the cheese Blinchiki, completely not thinking that they are probably Polish or Ukrainian, and not Russian! Felt a little bad, but they knew what I was talking about.   Can't wait to eat here again. I'm going for the pierogi this time. I usually make homemade pierogi with my grandmother, and it takes us six or seven hours. Too much work! I am glad there is an eastern european store around these parts. This is the first I've seen, and I really hope it stays!"}
{"text":"Delicious delicious! I'm so glad there is a Polish place on the East side! It was super busy but our food came relatively quick for being here right at noon. The sweet cheese dessert fried pierogis were my fave!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one where you savor every bite.  You know there is a chance you could leave still a bit hungry, but the excellent food and the excitement of trying new cultural cuisines won out.  Make sure you try this place."}
{"text":"Been coming to the market for 2 years. Recently tried the restaurant and was vey impressed, everything has perfect flavor! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in this place.  The prices are quite high so my friend and I splurged to eat here.  The salad was okay.  The bread was cold and butter when brought tasted like margarine.  The stuffed cabbage was too much meat and too little cabbage for my preference.  We tried both pork and beef.  We liked the mushroom gravy better than the tomato sauce.  The pierogi was just okay (potato/cheddar and potato/sauerkraut).  I would not go again."}
{"text":"Here in Phoenix on business and tried this place. Everything is great, I had onion and cheese pierogis and still needed more so then tried potato and cheddar cheese equally great. Staff was super attentive and I would travel from California just to eat here."}
{"text":"Why have I not been here every weekend?  Pierogies that are savory....Pierogies that are sweet... Delicious food and excellent service.  Make sure you arrive hungry as the portions will fill you up but don't forget the plum pierogi and a European coffee! DO IT!"}
{"text":"I came to this place because I had received  a gift card and I was told I couldn't use it at their market just in the restaurant. Their credit card system was down and I just wish that I was informed prior  browsing their store that only cash is accepted. I understand things go wrong but I feel I just wasted my time. I honestly would rather get cash back and make the pierogis myself at this point.  I had eaten there before once and the food is OK but a little overpriced."}
{"text":"Our waiter, a very pleasant young man who is clearly familiar with Ukrainian cuisine, helped us with recommendations and explanations, and kept careful watch on the water and bread. The bread was freshly baked and very flavorful, served with a dipping oil. The Ukrainian borscht, the house salad, the pierogis were all different than anything we've had; such a treat to sample a totally new cuisine! The food was served fresh, hot, and nicely arranged. And the flavor! The food was really, really good. I'm glad we found this through restaurant.com. It'll be a novel place to take winter visitors."}
{"text":"I usually don't leave a review until after a few time at a restaurant, unless it's really really good or really really bad lol. But it really was that good lol.   I gotta say this is one of the best spontaneous decision I have made these days lol.    What we ordered: red borsch (super hearty and satisfying)  Beef cabbage roll (mind blowinggg)  Pierogi w potato and cheddar ( we are not a fan of the filling, will try another filling)"}
{"text":"I came here for authentic eastern European food.  I was very happy with my selections and the front counter lady was very nice.  I purchased the lunch pierogi plate and the pork stuffed cabbage.  Fantastic...  I loved the sauerkraut and farmers cheese pierogi....  I even bought a bag of cheese to go!  Divey, order and pay at counter...  Very happy customer.. oh.  and my brother picked up some Russian Pickles and Pickled Cabbage.  The pickles are great, and I will have to make some stuffed cabbage out of the pickled stuff.."}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow in the restaurant. Two servers for 6 tables and looks to be one cook. The menu is simple and basic selections but pricey.  $20 for a dozen pierogi.  I ordered the beef sampler platter with 3 different kinds of pierogi at a $5 extra charge. My dinner $29. The cabbage roll is good, smoked sausage was standard not great, we ordered a fresh polish sausage also which was very good. Asked where they get them, Chicago of course! The casing was very thin and the flavor was also better than anywhere else I've had here in AZ.  The pierogi themselves are mediocre, not much as far as flavor, pretty bland but okay. Better homemade if you know how to do it, which I do so probably why only 3 stars. You can buy the polish sausage in the store for $6.99 lb."}
{"text":"I've eaten here and it was good and authentic. The pierogies fresh or frozen are fantastic.  The only reason why I keep coming back is for specialty items from their deli. They have good quality, authentic grocery items that I need from time to time.  Friendly staff, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Fantastic pierogi that I usually grab to cook at home, as well as a small selection of imported Eastern European items[ sweets, coffee].  Still need to try the golabki =) Bit pricey, but what can you do.This is not Chicago."}
{"text":"The stuffed cabbage was excellent. Pierogis were great too! Friendly staff. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Pierogis?!  One of our friends told us about this place so we decided to check it out last year. We just recently came back and now it actually had a restaurant to fit everyone. The menu has a lot of traditional items on it that are from the Ukraine area. There are Pierogies, Borsch, and other goodies.  The restaurant is a decent size. I wasn't sure what to expect since they have these large decals on the windows outside. the inside is simple and quaint. I ordered two different type of peirogis. I love their farmers cheese and onion and the farmers cheese and chive. There's an up charge is you get 2 different kinds which I find kind of silly but I wanted a variety so I went with it. The food was delicious and I love that they have sour cream and bacon on the side. All in all, my pierogis were perfect!   They've done a wonderful job expanding and I seriously love this hidden gem."}
{"text":"The food was great, and so was the beer. Service was really prompt too. This was my first time trying Ukrainian food, and I was greatly impressed!"}
{"text":"Holy crap that was sooo good!! We had the sampler plate and it did not do us wrong. Definitely will be a return customer. With the variety of great European beers and traditional cuisine, you cannot go wrong! :)"}
{"text":"Nice place, friendly lady. Small and cozy.  No high chair, bring your own ;)  Just wasn't super impressed.  They tasted like the ones you buy at Costco.  Was hoping for better.  Glad I was already on that side of town."}
{"text":"First time eating here, we got a groupon so thought we would try it out! LOVE IT! Great service and really really good food! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Market on one side resteraunt on the other. Great variety of pierogis. Prices are a bit much but not really when compared to other Euro spots I have been to."}
{"text":"Outstanding! I took my grams there for lunch {she's from Poland} the food was superb and reminded us of nana's food the smell and flavors were spot on to nanas! I am glad i dont live closer or i would be eating perogies and gulpmki (cabbage rolls) everyday!"}
{"text":"This place is very interesting. We came here because not only do we like pierogies and found an offer for this place on groupon, but we wanted to try something different. It's been open for only a couple months according to the waitress and it started out as the store that is right next to it. Apparently the store was so popular and people wanted to eat the food there so they opened up the place next to it. The food was pretty good. I had some feedback for the waitress on the food and she was more than willing to listen and said she'd pass it on. When you order you pick how many and then how many different flavors. They also have dessert ones. I'd certainly return and would be interested to see any changes along the way."}
{"text":"They have 21 different kinds of pierogies, both savory and sweet, and you can mix & match when you order. The 3 kinds I tried, in order of preference, were beef, cabbage and mushroom, & potato and onion. The sour cream & carmelized onions put them over the top, esp the beef! There's a freezer case if you want to take a bag home ($8.49/doz is a pretty good deal)."}
{"text":"This has recently become one of my favorite lunch spots.  Its a small place with only 3 or 4 tables and a few shelves of Polish (Ukrainian?) groceries.  They do sell frozen pierogis but stop in and try them fresh - you'll fantasize about them.  They have a small lunch menu - basically several types of pierogis, sausage, and various substances covered in cabbage.  Not so hot on the last two but I've had most of the kinds of pierogis they sell and they are all great.  Try the farmers cheese and potato ones fried with sour cream and bacon on them!  Also - Last time I was there they were also selling bits of a 5 lb block of sunflower halva.  Its a desertish thing that looks like... well it looks like you'd find it on a barn floor but it tastes wonderful. Definitely give that a try if your looking for something new."}
{"text":"I just tried this place the quality was great service also great I didn't know much about the food it was an adventure for me. I would give it a try"}
{"text":"The last post was right, the word needs to get out! We are always saying how we need more delicious mom and pops in the valley and here is one of them! Everything was fresh and at a great price. There is not a lot of seating, so consider placing an order to go and buying some of their frozen ones for later. They also have quite the selection in their market."}
{"text":"Came in with a Groupon which should have covered the whole order. I wanted to leave a better tip, so I also ordered some cabbage stew, and I'm glad I did. I only received half my order, so it came out to a whole meal. I have had MUCH better pierogies from Stanley's, except their new location is too far. I will never return to the All Pierogi place, no matter what. I'm giving it two stars although it doesn't deserve even that, but I am feeling generous. You're better off skipping this one, or, at least check your order before leaving."}
{"text":"it was great food, and nice beer choices...we really loved everything we ate"}
{"text":"This place delivers what it advertises. It feels authentic and tastes delicious. A little bit pricey and service was a little on the slower side, but overall a fun experience. *Be warned they close for a few hours between traditional lunch and dinner hours."}
{"text":"This place was really good! We had a large group and at first the server/hostess didn't seem to excited, but she warmed up quickly and was great. Everyone enjoyed their food. I had the meat sandwich with no bread... but it came with bread so I had to take it off (good thing it's a preference, not allergy). It was quite tasty!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed everything we had here. The pierogis were delicious as were the potato pancakes. My only complaint is not with the food which really was excellent, it's the prices. They seem to be VERY over priced in my opinion. Pierogis are not made with gold. Still, the food was delicious.If the prices weren't so high it would definitely be 5 stars."}
{"text":"A nice mom and pop that make great pierogies. They have a good variety. The jalapeño and cheese is not traditional but quite satisfying. The sauerkraut and mushroom have a nice, robust flavor. The hunters cheese reminds me of ricotta. Price wise it's up there, but since they make them in house it's worth it. The side of onions bacon and sour cream are a nice touch to the meal. the waiting staff are also meek and polite. Go check it out."}
{"text":"Dumplings bring joy and happiness the world round and pierogi's are the gold standard.  The Ukranian owners are friendly and have assembled a menu that is expansive and cheap.  Load up early as this place closes at 6."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times since I've moved to Phoenix.  I keep coming back is because there are so many choices of pierogies to choose from.  This is the closest you'll get to having an old fashioned polish dinner that reminds you of home.  When I don't have time for a sit down dinner, I visit the market adjacent to the restaurant and buy them to cook at home.  Depending on the time of day, you see them hand making pierogies in the kitchen.  There is also a russian flare to the food too which is equally delicious!  It's the best I've found in Phoenix and the hospitality of the wait staff has been excellent each time I visit."}
{"text":"This place is predominantly Polish cuisine. Pierogis are a national dish of Poland. There are several flavors, but potato is most traditional. We've been here twice now.  There is a market attached to this restaurant, but this review will focus on the restaurant.  The menu is a bit pricey.  Not sure why.  Portions are adequate but not huge.  It helps if you have a restaurant.com certificate.  Between the two visits we have tried their kielbasa (it was good but nothing special), the borscht (not my favorite but better than I expected given that it's made with beets which I do not like), a few different pierogis, the stuffed cabbage rolls, the potato pancakes, and the pelmeni (which are sort of like tortellini).  The pierogis really didn't impress me.  They are good, but bland.  Which I suspect is just the nature of the dish.  I've had pierogis elsewhere and they were bland too.  They are a dough stuffed with mashed potatoes, and sometimes a little seasoning depending on what you get, and then boiled.  Having never been to Poland I can't really compare to what they have there, but I can say that from the market you can see into the kitchen and it looks like grandma is in there turning these things out from scratch by hand.  So kudos there!  The pelmeni are more like a stuffed pasta, but the stuffing is a meat.  Sort of reminds me of Chinese dumplings (\"potstickers\").  They were tastier than the pierogi, but still sort of bland.  The tomato dipping sauce helps them A LOT.  The potato pancakes are much better than those one gets in an American restaurant.  I assume it is some seasoning, or maybe the oil they use.  They do compress the shredded potato into a very tight patty rather than a loose one, so it doesn't fall apart the way a lot of potato pancakes do.  The beef cabbage rolls are really good.  Easily my favorite thing on the menu.  Very tasty, especially with the mushroom sauce.  Music isn't complementary to a Polish restaurant. US top 40, maybe? Works against the cuisine and motif.  I think they should change it to something a bit more Polish (or at least something that isn't obviously American since I certainly wouldn't know Polish music if I heard it).  Overall I would probably give this place 3.5 stars.  However, service is good, food is fresh, and if I allow for the fact that the dishes really are supposed to be bland, I can see bumping them to four stars.  I know we will be back.  Especially for that beef cabbage roll!!"}
{"text":"Great food but they are often short on servers. Love the pierogis and the sausage."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Cabbage rolls!  Cabbage rolls!    CABBAGE ROLLS!  Get them with beef!  Soooooooo good.  They're the perfect texture, filling is hot, substantial and SO TASTY.  The red sauce they use is just sweet and tangy enough.  My fiancee let me have a taste of the smoked sausage she had on her plate and it was of equal quality to everything else we had.  The pierogi come in so many different varieties and the plate meals are just the right amount of food.  Lastly, we purchased a poppy-seed roll to snack on for the weekend I was in town.  It was one of the best I'd had.  Service is great too!  The ladies are very nice!"}
{"text":"My family makes pierogis from scratch every Christmas. I understand the amount of labor that goes into these delicious little guys. But this place was a joke. Extremely over priced for the amount of food you get. One of the wonderful aspects of enjoying a pierogi are the sautéed onions they are supposed to be drowned in. They gave a tiny sauce cup of onions for six pierogis! I was not impressed and will not be returning. I think I need to convince my parents to open a real pierogi shop and show em how it's done."}
{"text":"I've got to confess, I grew up with a grandma who made amazing pierogies. My mom and her sisters all used to make tons of pierogies at every holiday.  So when I found out that restaurants featuring my favorite food where opening in Mesa, I was ready to eat.    My first stop was All Pierogi Kitchen . I found their pierogi selections to be stellar. The texture, tenderness, and flavor of their pocket delights are amazing. The necessary side items (butter, bacon, onions and sour cream) were perfect as well.   I also tried the smoked kielbasa sausage and it worked very well indeed.   The restaurant visit was a good experience each of the 3 times I visited. Kind staff, hot food delivered to the table and reasonable speed. The cost is slightly higher than you might expect at $12 for 12 pierogies, but it really is more food than most people can eat.  I've tried the other pierogi places, but they don't stack up to All Pierogi Kitchen for the real original flavor of homemade pierogi.  Try it !"}
{"text":"Best pierogi place in town. I ordered the beef sampler and it came with a beef stuffed cabbage baked with their homemade tomato sauce, smoked polish sausage, and 6 pierogis. It was amazing! There was so much flavor. Side note, if you order the smoke polish sausage, you must try the hot mustard with it. Great comfort food."}
{"text":"Wow,we just found a new favorite place to eat. It's hard to find a place that can make Polish food like home but they did it here!!"}
{"text":"This was a super fun AND yum dinner. We went on a Saturday evening, and enjoyed the extra bonus of live accordion music! The man playing the accordion knew a wide range of songs- it was not a straight hour of polka! No one in our group had been here before but we will all be back! It was a little difficult to choose which flavors of Pierogis to order, my husband and I both picked two kinds each and shared. They were all amazing! Save room for the dessert pierogies, too! Great night!"}
{"text":"Amazing perogies and friendly staff. Will definitely be returning to buy the frozen perogies to have at home."}
{"text":"Waited a few minutes to be seated but only because they seemed fairly busy and only had one waitress. Once she seated us, she was very friendly. Food was really good (had fried chicken pierogies, fried farmers cheese and potato pierogies, fried potato and cheddar pierogies, and dessert pierogies (apple cinnamon and sweet cheese). Even picked up some pierogies from their market. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites. The food is delicious. Everything is made fresh and prepared just the way you like it. I've eaten here several times and I have never been disappointed"}
{"text":"Good solid food, I tend to over order when going here.   My wife loves the Farmers Cheese, and I am partial to the Siberian Pelmeni plate.   Also there are no boiled...Only fried pierogi."}
{"text":"First time here today. Got my order to go, 24 pierogis, 3 stuffed cabbages, & a couple sausages. Pierogis are available fried or boiled & sausages can be cooked or uncooked. Added on caramelized onions for pierogis.  Wasn't a fan of the sausage & sauerkraut, a little bland for my taste. Pierogis were delicious, went with the potato & cheddar ones. Had the beef stuffed cabbage & they were really tasty & included a creamy tomato sauce. There's only about four tables for dining in. The side wall is dedicated to Polish groceries. They have a nice selection of drinks, side dishes, & desserts including several frozen cakes & a HUGE variety of frozen pierogis to take home."}
{"text":"Our server was friendly and helpful in suggesting specific pierogis and beers to try. The food came out quickly and was delicious. Nevertheless, prices are very steep and hinder the ability to try multiple pierogis. If you are dining in a group of 3 or more than its certainly helpful if everyone orders different types of pierogis to avoid the surcharge. However, everything else about this place definitely warrants repeat visits."}
{"text":"If you've never had pierogies, then I'm sorry for you. If you've had pierogies and know how awesome they are but have never been here, then I'm sorry for you too. We don't live in town anymore but I will definitely keep this in our rotation of restaurants when we come to the valley. Everything we have tried has been fantastic!! Pierogies, cabbage rolls, kielbasa, potato pancakes, sauerkraut. The service was solid and we left with a midnight snack. A must try for any east valley food adventurers."}
{"text":"Well this better be the best Polish food I've ever eaten. We've been sitting here for 72 minutes waiting for our food. If I wasn't so hungry, I'd walk out. They're not even that busy. Service is so bad I won't even bother reviewing the food. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Very Nice place to shop/eat. I would recommend to any body who loves Russian food. Place is nice, food is nice. only one thing : the food at restaurant is a little pricey."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurants deserve the recognition. I really enjoyed my experience here yesterday.  Food: delicious, authentic, reminded me of my mom's home cooking and this warmed my soul. The borsch is delicious. The complimentary bread tastes homemade and I loved dipping it in the olive oil/salt/pepper mixture which is so simple but tasted so good and comforting. The lettuce cabbage salad with dill and feta cheese was delicious (I think this is included with the entree purchase). The entrees are large in size and reasonably priced. The beef cabbage roll was delicious and the perogies were really nice as well. I had only wished the plate came with more sautéed onion and sour cream for the perogies.   Service: friendly, helpful, attentive.   Would I return? Yes! Wishing this restaurant lots of success."}
{"text":"What a find! Upon opening the front door we were welcomed by live accordion music by a man dressed in folk costume. The songs were familiar and very lively, I was hungry but felt like dancing, what a wonderful dilemma. My stomach won.  I ordered borscht soup, which arrived lidded, very hot, hearty and so flavorful. A basket of complimentary delicious bread was placed before us with a dish of herbs in olive oil. (We devoured 2 baskets full) We sampled the potato mushroom Pierogi which were good ( wish there was more mushroom) A shredded cabbage salad with tasty dressing came with the meal and that was yummy. My hub enjoyed his meat filled stuffed cabbage with tomato sauce, but I prefer it more tangy. His Polish porter beer was dark and delightful.   Our waitress was very friendly and the atmosphere was very nice, we plan to return."}
{"text":"Wow what do you say when you are trying a place for the first time and you get more then bargained for  Our first time there and there were 5 of us  Service was on top of things the whole meal  Food is prepared as it is ordered nothing prepared ahead of times do for that reason it seems slow to us hurried Americans But oh so worth the wait  You have to experience borscht and especially the dill pickle kilbossa soup  So good  The portions were huge so much food I ended up eating so much I was uncomfortable and then took some home I favor the jalepeno and cheese pierogis but didn't try all they had too many to count  They have a euro market next door which is interesting  All the servers do double duty helping to also help out with cooking in the kitchen but didn't miss a beat when it came to checking on us"}
{"text":"I am NOT certain which I am more disappointed in, writing this less than stellar Review or the dining experience itself, as I approached my visit with great anticipation.  I believe that the recent Positive Republic Review and others may have stressed this little Restaurant beyond its capability. The Cashier mentioned that \"\"we have been slammed,\" although there were only four others dinning at other tables on this day. Nonetheless, my father (A Chef) always said that \"the test of a good Restaurant is consistency.\" That being said, my Review follows.  I opted on my first visit to \"Test\" lots, so I went for the \"Sample Plate.\" It had:             Stuffed Cabbage - which was cold, not even warm, but of excellent             quality with a nice tomato sauce.             Home Made Polish Sausage - Absolutely tasteless. Not even a hint of spice,             it also was served less than hot and not really even warm.             Pierogi - I opted for three different kinds and found each to be pasty and             without much flavor, although unlike their \"plate mates\" they were served             hot. Caramelized onions would have been a good and likely tasty addition,             but I opted for the sour cream. My barometer for Pierogi is a New Jersey             Polish Restaurant and unfortunately, even after all these years, I have NOT             found any others to measure up.  The staff was quite nice and welcoming, although meals are served on paper plates with plastic utensils and that is generally a \"no, no\" for me, as it makes cutting things (Polish Sausage) difficult.  Value? Not at all certain that if everything was FABULOUS, I would have felt it was a good value.  In keeping with my personal philosophy of writing a Good Review only after two visits or more and writing a \"Less Than Good Review\" after only one visit, I will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"I bought a groupon to try this place and I am soooo glad that I did!  I don't think I would have discovered this place otherwise.  What a quaint little mom and pop place.  We started our meal with a polish beer (recommended by our server...A+), homemade bread and borscht.  The bread was airy and light.  Beautiful presentation in a rustic looking ramekin.  I love borscht and this one did not disappoint!  Since this was our first visit, we decided to try the \"surprise me pierogi platter\".  It comes with bacon, grilled onions and sour cream on the side to top your pierogis.  All of the pierogis were delicious!  My favorites were the farmers cheese, cabbage and potato with cheese.     After our meal I went over to their market next door and the lady running it said I could get borscht to go at anytime without calling ahead first, (so basically you will be seeing a lot more of me).  I also noticed they had all of the Pierogis that they offer in the restaurant in the market in case you want to pick up some of your favorites to make at home.  They also offer Pel Meni.  I happen to LOVE pel meni and am excited to try theirs the next time I visit!"}
{"text":"Absolutely THE best pierogies around!! The cabbage rolls are amazing!! Service was a little bit slow considering we were the second table there when they opened. The prices for beverages is a little confusing with prices for cans/bottles different. But the food...cannot get better!! Looking forward to our next visit!!"}
{"text":"There were five of us and we managed to order just about everything on the menu.  The stars on the menu are the cabbage rolls and the polish sausages.  You can also buy them frozen to go from the little market next door.  I was so happy I ordered the food I did.  The pierogis were not as flavorful as I thought they should be.  But I had them here form the first time.  The menu was hard to understand and for some reason they feel like they can charge us extra for trying different flavor. They need a tasting platter of pierogis.  They also need the weight staff to know which flavor is which. I would like to have the cabbage rolls and sausage again.  Post your thoughts on the pierogis. So I will know the right  flavor to try next time.   If you like my reviews please follow me on yelp."}
{"text":"For November's International Supper Club, we headed on over to All Pierogi Euro Kitchen & Market, and like others have said in the store area there is a table with four chairs, but walk to the door east of that and you will find the restaurant with plenty of seating.  Pierogis are like little pastry pillows of potato goodness, I went with the 9 pierogi plate, and went for the cheddar & jalapeno, potato & bacon and & potato & cheddar, you can get them fried or boiled, I went fried. They come with sour cream, caramelized onions & bacon bits. This plate looked simple but the flavors were delsih! I really enjoyed the potato pierogis, by far my favorites, the cheddar & jalapeno where alright, I just was expect maybe more jalapeno.   Service was friendly, we were a party of 15 on a busy night, so I'm sure that bogged them down a bit. But otherwise, it was great.  I'm looking forward to coming back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"The Pierogi are amazing at this place. There are so many options and they're all good. I've been here a couple times and the service is good too. I haven't had much on the menu yet, but so far I plan on eventually tasting everything."}
{"text":"This was a reasonably priced restaurant and it was filling. I went to Arizona for a retreat and my friend suggested the place. It was pretty filling. I ordered the beef, bacon and potatoes pierogis--delicious. My friends also ordered the potatoe and cheese, mushroom and cabbage, and then we also ordered the chefs surprise which had chicken, potatoe, potatoe and cheese, and a couple others that we weren't able to identify, but it was overall a great experience. We also tried their sparkling European drinks, I had the apple and my friends tried the baikul and another tea that came in a can. The baikul drink was delicious, very different another with the tea. Would definitely recommend if you're feeling a little adventurous. The staff also was friendly and they kept answering all our questions with no hassel. Great customer service, in a friendly environment."}
{"text":"Amazing!!  Cute restaurant, very clean.  Perogies are fantastic, full of flavor.  Mine were pan fried, potato and mushrooms.  Also had a pork cabbage roll.  Also full of flavor and perfectly cooked.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"They make pierogi's from scratch, and so many varieties!!  I find that they taste better if boiled, since frying can dry them out a bit.  These are by far the best pierogies except for Chicago, (and i would guess Poland and The Ukraine as well).  Everyone needs to experience their food !!  Service is okay, not fantastic, but not bad.  This place is a MUST!!"}
{"text":"We discovered this \"little gem\" when our son was in for the holidays. Their cabbage rolls are the closest thing to how my mom use to make them and my husband and son agreed. Very tasty!! We enjoyed the varieties of pierogis  that they offered and will definitely do the combo platter with the sausage next time. The farmer's cheese perogis were a perfect way to end the meal."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back!!! Their pierogis are amazing!! Of course!! And the homemade bread.... couldn't get enough!!! We also tried the potato salad and we loved it!! And the service was great!! It's going to be my go to treat for myself!!!   I've been back since and it is so great!!! I think they may have changed the bread a little-which was a little disappointing. But the pierogis are perfect!!"}
{"text":"Pierogi's man! I could eat these all day, eeryday!  There's nothing I could say bad about this place, everyone else has basically said what I was thinking - really good food and their market has a really diverse selection of candies, ice creams, etc. from Europe!  I would defo come back to buy their pierogi's so I could make them at home - so good!"}
{"text":"Best take out ever!! We ordered a bunch of pierogies, sausage, cabbage rolls, and meatballs for the whole family. It was seriously delish! The only issue we had was timing. We ordered online and they said it would take 15-20 minutes. When my husband went to pick it up, the food wasn't ready for an additional 25 minutes. We will definitely order again, but we will allow more preparation time."}
{"text":"Food was okay, not as good as in Hamtramck (MI). Prices are v e r y  high. You make golobki (stuffed cabbage) with ground beef, veal and pork. Must use these three meats. Cabbage is better in the fall. Hope the cooks take some advice."}
{"text":"very excellent and authentic. if you would like to try some that is different than what you typically expect in the valley, please try this place. we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I highly recommend you try the sampler combo with a side of potato pancakes. It'll feed three and it's very reasonably priced. Our waitress was extremely sweet. We're definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVED this place and the food. The restaurant is small and cozy, the waitress is very friendly and attentive, and the attached European grocery has some delicious items that you can't resist. I had the Sampler plate that had 6 pierogis ( your choice from a large selection), a wonderful salad of cabbage and fresh dill, a huge, DELICIOUS cabbage roll with a delicious tomato sauce (or mushroom gravy if you prefer), a large serving of kielbasa and several small servings of condiments. It's was the best cabbage roll I've had in many years and made just right. I will go back again and again to this authentic Eastern European restaurant."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Going back to this place for the second time became, NEVER going back again EVER! We went early to avoid the rush. The place was half filled at 5:30 so getting in and out would be a breeze. Not even close. As the place filled up, we waited for our order, and at about the 45 minute mark we noticed tables getting their food. Tables that arrived 15-30 minutes after us. Our waitress payed no attention to us at all and my wife had to get up to flag her down and inquire about our order. She went to the kitchen and at the 1 hour mark our food arrived. My stuffed cabbage, hard and lukewarm, barely. My wife's sausage, nearly cold. We never even tried the pierogi as we got our waitress back to our table. We're obviously not happy. One entire hour and the food is essentially COLD! This gem of a waitress, when told the food wasn't even warm asked, \"Are you sure?\". I showed her how the fork wouldn't even cut thru the cabbage roll and she told us it would be another half hour to bring us edible food.  No apology, no suggestion, no nothing. 15 years of trying dozens of indie restaurants in the valley and congratulations to the All Pierogi Kitchen, WORST experience of probably 500 meals out. Needless to say, we won't be back and I suggest you avoid this place like the plague unless sitting and waiting around for an hour, for nothing, is your idea of a good time."}
{"text":"Exceptional,  authentic food.  Do you miss your grandma's cooking? Omg...  I love this place!!"}
{"text":"The thing you come here for is the pierogies, and while they may well be making these pierogies in the kitchen in back, they taste commercial. The dough is way to thick and heavy and the pierogis are dense--not unlike a frozen one from the grocery store.  When you have a homemade pierogi, the thickness of the dough should be the same as a wonton; not a Mrs' Ts.  This place was not worth the trip across town--and I would drive anywhere for a good home made pierogi."}
{"text":"The food was all homemade and very good. The pierogis were great. Service was friendly.  They also nice selection of Russian and Polish beer and vodkas."}
{"text":"The food brought me back to my childhood and was worth the drive for us.  My family loved the polish sausage and my favorite was sauerkraut and mushroom pierogi. There wasn't enough room in my tummy to try everything, so it's a good thing they deliver. Ambiance was not there, but the food was well worth the trip and the hospitality of the staff made up for it."}
{"text":"For a reasonably priced restaurant, this place was great. We came in with 8 hungry men and ordered 4 plates of pierogi's and 4 cabbage roles and left stuffed. They fry these the right way by first boiling the pierogi's and then frying them so they're not too crisp. They server them with bacon, sour creme and caramelized onions which is delicious. If you order the 18 pierogi's this is plenty for two people.   This restaurant is family owned and extremely nice to guests."}
{"text":"OMG!  This place is great and authentic.  Eat here, take it to go or buy it frozen to cook later at home.     Pierogie - various stuffings Pelmeni - various stuffings Stuffed cabbage - pork, beef or chicken Sausage  All homemade!  Borsch, sweet cabbage salad, and a store with a variety of ethnic delights."}
{"text":"Grew up eating pierogis, sausage, cabbage. This place feels like I was at a relatives and they cooked me a private meal. Cozy restaurant, even when it's packed. Food was delicious and well portioned. Entrees come with plenty of food and reasonably priced (~$15). Ready to take my Polish mother here so she can eat like the good ol' days!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband absolutely loved it there, everything was just like you'd have any houswife make in Ukraine or Russia! My husband is very picky in food and I was very happy to see him try and eat everything he ordered"}
{"text":"we didnt realize they open after 4 for dinner service and showed up too early, that didnt stop them from welcoming us into their restaurant. the pierogies   were amazing and the service was great."}
{"text":"Excellent idea and execution. I love that the pierogies rotate and then lunch special was very affordable. Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"Bought some frozen pierogis and made 1 bag (a dozen) at home. The directions were kinda iffy, said to put a half glass of water in a pan, add pierogis and 3 spoons of butter and to mix until the water dissolved but it never did so I just took them out of the water and baked them. Two of them broke open. I got the Farmers cheese and potato and Potato and Mushroom. They were $9.99/bag of 12 so a bit pricey but I'd never tried them and I like trying new foods. I did like the farmers cheese ones, they do need some sort of dip (people suggest sour cream but I'm not a big fan of it). I just added salt, Sriracha would be good too.  The shop itself is small and cute, lots of goods to peruse. The Yelp checkin discount is for the restaurant, which I did not try."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! Amazing pierogis! I have tried every single flavor; all taste great!! Just writing this review makes me want to go have dinner there tonight. The atmosphere is great as well: cozy and friendly. The service has always been great and they are more than happy to go over any questions you may have. I can't vouch for other items on the menu since the pierogis are so good I can't venture too far from them. Recommend this place all around."}
{"text":"The pirogies were great, and the house sausage was also excellent.  Wild mushroom salad was tasty, and the fresh bread is addictive.  We are really looking forward to going back so that we can try more of the menu.  This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Growing up in the west,  I'd never tried a Pierogi before,  so I wanted to make sure I had the full experience.   We were definitely not disappointed, and we'll be making another trip back soon.   The family and I got 2 of the 12 piece assortments,  and a beef stuffed cabbage roll.   We got 3 each of all the potato pierogi's and 3 each of all 3 of the meat,  all very tasty.   I got all the meat ones fried along with the farmers cheese and potato,  and the rest were boiled. Next time we're getting all fried,  but boiled was ok too.  Only problem was that none of them were labeled,  so we had to cut them all in half to see what they were.   The cabbage roll was very juicy and the beef was cooked perfectly,  and the tomato sauce they topped it with was chunky and tasty, with a hit of sweetness and red bell pepper.   They close early,  so get there before you make plans for the evening or \"No Pierogi's for you\"!"}
{"text":"Oh dear Lord. I love food. It's that simple. This place will definitely take you back especially the pork cabbage rolls. The sauce is fresh and the pork is high quality. I don't eat meat unless I eat out and this place is definitely worth it. (Insert Homer Simpson drooling.)"}
{"text":"The appeal of this place is that it's the only Eastern European restaurant/market I can think of in the East Valley. The pierogies are all quite expensive considering this is poor people food from the former Soviet Union. I think a dozen pierogies are about 13 dollars, much more expensive than I think pierogies should be. It's kind of like tacos costing $8 per taco - they just dont cost that much to make so it seems hard to justify high prices.   Despite the relatively high cost, it's nice to have the option to buy things you cant buy at a regular grocery store. The dessert pierogies are very good (apple cinnamon) and the beef cabbage roll was flavorful."}
{"text":"Fantastic Polish restaurant. My wife and I are from the Chicago area and her mother was Polish. We often went to Polish restaurants there. This place is as good as any in the city. We both had the sampler plate but picked different options so we could share. Everything was great."}
{"text":"My mother and grandmother would probably disown me for this but their stuff cabbage rolls were the BEST I have ever had. The tomato sauce was the perfect combo of spices. Bread and oil for table were so good I had to force myself not to fill up on them. Wish I had room for desert but the Combo plate of cabbage rolls & 6 pierogis (had the potato & mushroom) were very filling. Found my new favorite spot in Mesa."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but rather expensive for what you get, and the service was very slow. For those who like to smother their pierogis with sour cream and onions, you will be disappointed, because you only get about a tablespoon of each with your order. The pricing structure is very convoluted -- you can order one flavor of pierogi for a certain price, but if you want an additional flavor, then it costs more. Since we wanted to try more than 3 flavors, we paid a lot for the privilege. We also ordered dessert pierogis, and those took about 30 minutes to arrive at our table, and by that time, we just wanted to get our check and go home. I doubt we'll be back, because honestly, the frozen pierogis at Costco taste just about as good, and we can have all the sour cream and onions we want at home!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we had a horrible experience at this location.   We went in with an open mind, we presented a Groupon before purchasing anything, and a server verified that it was valid.   There were about five tables with people, one server, service was slow and took forever to get a hold of the only server there.  Food was OK, nothing special.   At the end of all this, they did not honor the Groupon, and all the server said was \"there is nothing I can do about it\".  I would rather go to McDonald's than this place.    Good luck."}
{"text":"Very friendly, quick service, food was authentic and DELICIOUS!!! We will be back! Such a treat to have a place like this in AZ"}
{"text":"All Pierogi Kitchen 1245 W. Baseline Road Mesa  Sometimes you find a gem in a place where you never thought you would find one. This is a gem!   The owner (and employees) come from the Ukraine, and the food is as authentic as it gets. I've eaten there a number of times now, and the food is consistent, flavorful, and wonderful. They have a total of 4 stores across the valley.  I started with a bowl of borscht. This wasn't the stuff from a jar, but real, homemade borscht with sour cream in the middle. I know that in the Slavic countries, borscht isn't necessarily made with beets, and even sometimes has meat in it, but this was so good I could have made the entire meal out of it. Even a beet hater would have enjoyed this.  Next, I ordered the Sample Plate ($13.88). A stuffed cabbage roll, a polish sausage, and 6 pierogi. Eating the stuffed cabbage brought back wonderful memories of my mothers cooking and tears to my eyes. It was a big roll with wonderful sauce on top - not too spicy and piping hot exactly like my mother used to make.  Next I tried the polish sausage. Again, different than what you get in most places - flavorful, but not overly spiced, and not a trace of grease. Finally were  the pierogi. I ordered mine fried, and they were perfection. In the assortment that I ordered were potato, cabbage, sauerkraut, cabbage and mushroom, and potato and cheese. They were all fabulous and served with a side of heavy sour cream and sauteed onions. In particular, the sauerkraut and the cabbage deserve high praise. The cabbage was almost naturally sweet, and the sauerkraut was not the typical sour stuff you usually get.  They also have sweet pierogi made with cherry, blueberry, apple and cinnamon, prune, and other flavors that you can order.  Everything is handmade on the premises (you can even see them making them in the back) and the pierogi are cooked to order. In the front is a small grocery section which has all sorts of imported foods.  The only reason they did not get 5 stars is because there is no atmosphere at all. It's basically a grocery store with 6 tables that you may have to wait to sit at because of the crowd.   If you are only interested in having wonderful food, home made, made by wonderful people who are genuinely interested in making sure you have a good experience and leave stuffed, then this is the place for you.  I'm usually happy to write my reviews and share them, but this is the first time I'm hesitant to have it published. The place is already busy and I'm afraid I won't be able to get in if they get any more business!  4 stars for excellent food, attentive service, and cleanliness."}
{"text":"Excellent service Gabrielle the best server ever.The homemade peirogi and cabbage rolls are like my friend's mother made.Wonderful atmosphere.  we'll be back. And we're telling our friends to come."}
{"text":"OMG!  How have I lived all my life never having had a pierogi?  And I'm not going to start now, if I know what's good for me.  But I don't.    This review is not for the restaurant which looks very nice and I hope to go soon.  I went to the market and bought one dozen potato and sauerkraut pierogis.  I made them in the skillet with onions , butter and water, following the package instructions.  These were so AMAZING!  They were so good that I could see me easily forming a new food addiction.  Just fantastic!!     Homemade goodness!"}
{"text":"It had pear sparkling juice came in a big bottle of happiness. I ordered borsch (came with bread - dense bread that holds in soup) as a starter. A small plate of salad came out, that had very light dressing.  I shared Pork Sampler: 6 pieces of pierogies (mushroom&potato), rolled cabbage, and sausage. They were all great and very soulful."}
{"text":"Had the farmers cheese&potato and the pork Pierogis and they were absolutely delicious!! The restaurant is very cute inside and we had great service. At the end of the meal I went over to the market side and got some of their food to take home. Super glad we found this place :)"}
{"text":"When a friend told me there was a Pierogi place near my house I was excited. I went and had dinner two nights later and saying I was happy doesn't do it justice. I had the Kielbasa with Cabbage and Mushroom Pierogis. I also got to try the Meatballs with Tomato Sauce and the Farmers Cheese and Chive Pierogis.  The Kielbasa was lean and tasty. Both Pierogis were great but the Meatballs were fantastic. On a whim I took the Beef Stuffed Cabbage with Mushroom Gravy for lunch. It was very good but didn't compare to the Meatballs. Probably because the Tomato Sauce was much richer in flavor. Don't forget to visit the market next door. It has so many goodies including Cracovia Plum Butter. Simply Fantastic."}
{"text":"Good Russian cafe with a small store attached. I liked that my pierogi's were pan fried. The stuffed cabbage roll was good, but the tomato sauce was more sweet than savory. The only minor issue I had is that the menu is really confusing."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience with my family. Found the restaurant on Groupon and decided to try them.  It was like going back to my grandma's house almost; great cabbage rolls, homemade pyrogies and sausages.  Good prices and excellent friendly service from Jason, who is as Ukrainian as Wonderbread, but still very attentive. My 10 year old son, who hates everything except pizza, ate everything on his plate. My favorite was the potato and onion."}
{"text":"I came here for the International Supper Club dinner last month. Like almost everyone else at the table I ordered some of their namesake Pierogis but it ended up being the stuffed cabbage that stole the show. It was hearty and filling, perfectly cooked and served with a delicious tomato sauce that I really enjoyed. It brought me back to the galumpkis my Mom used to make growing up (she is 1/2 Polish). Food was delicious and I highly recommend. The little adjacent market was kind of cool to browse as well. The service was a little off but hey we are a large group and can be hard to handle sometimes."}
{"text":"Went for our 1st time and took our out of town relatives from Seattle Washington to experience what we grew up with in Chicago.  We were not disappointed one bit!! The food was just like our old family recipes!  We had the Potato pancakes with Pierogi and smoked and fresh sausage.  The sausage was just like Easter morning and all the samples of Pierogi was DELICIOUS!!  A must visit place !!  Also shopped in the deli to take a little of Poland home for later!! Please do not ever change your recipe! Can't wait to visit again!!I Would have  given more stars if available!"}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for this place and am so glad I did. The pierogi were delicious (don't forget to try the sweet ones too) and the place has a cool European vibe. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Review 4/10 for the 10 bookmarked businesses to review before the end of 2016! From Meagan B.'s thread: https://www.yelp.com/topic/phoenix-yelp-phoenixs-10-firsts-of-2016  Holy pierogi, they have some mighty tasty Eastern European food here! We stepped in for dinner and ordered the chef's surprise pierogis, borscht, and a beef cabbage roll for dinner.   After we ordered we were brought some warm bread with seasoned oil. The bread was soft and very lightly sweet, with a crusty exterior. The borscht came next, a hearty bowl of red stewed deliciousness. The flavors were spot on, and it was richly flavored. It was served with sour cream which was a perfect complement to the stew.   The pierogis came next. We got mix of cheese, potato, meat (I think we got beef and pork), and a mushroom/sauerkraut pierogi. We requested them fried, and they were lightly crispy with a chewy doughy exterior. All the pierogis were well seasoned and came with some fried onions, sour cream, and a bacon/pork belly mixture.   The cabbage roll was decent. The beef was a little too dense in texture for my tastes but I did enjoy the tomato sauce it was served with.  They have a wide selection of Eastern European drinks. I indulged in a Russian style Kvas which was delicious. It was like a cross between a soda and a beer, lightly sweet, with a malty taste. It's essentially like a very light beer, with only around 2% alcohol content.  We finished our meal with some dessert pierogis. We had a mix of sweet farmer's cheese and blueberry. Out of the two I enjoyed the farmer's cheese more. The blueberry was made with fresh blueberries but it was a bit dry for me since there wasn't any other additional ingredient in the filling, just whole blueberries.   Service was very warm and friendly. We did have to remind the servers to give us bowls for sharing the soup and we weren't initially served any sour cream with the borscht though.  Overall it was a great meal. I'll be back for more delicious pierogis and borscht!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!! Reminds me of my grandma! She made the best pierogis!!! So this food took me back."}
{"text":"Amazing ethnic food too good to be true!  Great friendly staff.  If I go again, it won't be on Saturday,  it was very busy and loud."}
{"text":"Enjoy Pierogis here and authentic Polish cuisine.    We savored the cabbage stuffed roll with potato and cheese pierogis.   Don't forget to enjoy the dessert pierogis with a cup of tea.   My husband enjoys the different beers from around the Polish region."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious, service was great, everyone is so nice. Cozy atmosphere - definitely a place to relax and enjoy the food. Loved it all! Cabbage rolls, mushroom salad, potato pancakes and the farm cheese pierogi with bacon bits !  Can't wait to come back and try more !"}
{"text":"Finally!  I've been meaning to check this place out since I saw the International Supper Club was gonna hold their UYE here and I managed to snag a Groupon (it's still out there, guys!).  Also, I had an idea of what pierogis due to my sample trips, I mean, grocery trips to Costco.  But those were frozen pierogis.  I wanted the real deal.  And these pierogis did not disappoint.  The two of us shared 12 beef pierogis and the smoked sausage plate with 6 farmer's cheese and potato pierogis, and I was stuffed.  Got all of them fried instead of boiled cause everything's better fried.  Look at the State Fair!  Case in point.  The pierogis are sizable too, might I add.  About 2.5 inches in diameter?  I don't know if I'd get the beef again because I was expecting slices of beef but it turned out to be really smoothly ground beef.  But those cheese and potato pierogis?  I could eat that all day.  Probably not the best idea for my waistline, but I'll deal with that later.  I'm really excited to try the dessert pierogis next time though!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE the borsch...even in an Arizona summer and temps above 110 degrees out. I can be a bit of a soup connoisseur, and this borsch ranks as one of my favorites. I would also recommend the cabbage rolls, sausage, and pierogi. All very good, home cooked, Eastern European comfort food. Atmosphere and staff are very pleasant. I would rate the food 5 stars, but pierogi pricing at 3-4 stars, hence my 4 star rating."}
{"text":"It was our 1st visit here and believe not the last one , we absolutely loved food here , everything tasted like back home , yummmyyy !  Btw that's the largest pierogi selection I have ever seen , we ll have to save some place for a dessert next time."}
{"text":"My mom and I went for lunch the other day and were very pleased! We make our own pierogies, which we of course love, but these were just as good and they have a much larger variety than what we make. Unfortunately, we didn't try anything other than the pierogies and the bread they served, but we did buy several homemade items from the attached market. Being there was like being at grandma's house with all its goodness and warmth. I look forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"Went again today and had another excellent experience! The service is always so good and friendly and then there's the food...DELICIOUS!!! Today I ordered the potato and kielbasa sampler with a rainbow salad. I literally want to go back and have the exact same thing tomorrow! With my place, I had the smoked kielbasa and cheddar potato, pan fried pierogis. PYSZNA!! :)"}
{"text":"This place is clean well run, and staff very friendly.   The food is freshly prepared and very good.  The food is not exotic and the portions are not huge and you don't get soft drink refills.   Just a quiet, clean place to go and enjoy fresh pierogi with your family and friends."}
{"text":"I go to Pirogies once in a while, when I miss pelmeni too much. Pelmeni are usually well made, however, they are so very overpriced. They used to be cheaper when the restaurant was so small, it shared the grocery store space.  Once, I tried their samsa, it wasn't very authentic.  Their service is so-so. Nine out of my ten visits, they didn't serve me salad that was supposed to accompany my pelmeni plate."}
{"text":"Walked in today around 1pm for lunch. The place had about 4 tables seated. We were seated and sat for 15 minutes without anyone coming to take our order. We left.  I'll give it another try sometime. The menu looked good, the decor was nice. It's probably good. Unfortunately, I didn't have 2 hours for lunch today.  By the way, I watched another table get upset with waiting for their check. I could see they were getting annoyed/irritated. The man finally got up and walked over to the waitress to ask for it.  Is it too hard to get wait staff to take your order?"}
{"text":"We went to All Pierogi Kitchen a few months ago to fill a pierogi craving, and I was not disappointed! It is a quaint little place with a small market attached, do check out the market. The staff is very friendly and eager to help you choose between pierogi's or other menu items if you're not sure what you want! All of the pierogis we had were delicious, but in particular I liked the farm cheese and chive and potato and onion... mmmmm!!!! I would also recommend trying the cabbage roll with tomato sauce, this tasted homemade, had so many layers of flavor and was just delicious. The only downside is that it does seem a little expensive when you want to try more than 2-3 pierogis, but otherwise it was great!"}
{"text":"Found this place recently. Had to try it. This is exactly what small local business is all about. Amazing home cooked pierogis by the owner and her family. Really small kitchen and dining area but she is expanding next door to separate the grocery from the dining. You can buy frozen hand made pierogis and take home or many other authentic foods, spices etc. I recommend the pierogi plate and trying the cheddar and jalapeño. I will be back. Support local business."}
{"text":"So, I finally made it here with a few friends!  THE FOOD  So for the Russians out there, this place has a huge variety of . For the Ukrainians out there, you already knew that :)  Besides variety of Pierogis that you can either buy from the fridge and cook on your own (actually, just 5 minutes in hot water, as they are pre-cooked), you can also order any of them to eat right there. We've tried a few types and liked them all, obviously some more than other, personal preferences and all. There are also a few more types of food (sausages and what not), that I can't comment on just yet, but expect them to be good.  There is also some food for sale (pickles, caviar, soups, some awesome syrups, bread, etc.) so you can walk away with a variety of things to eat.  SETTING  For the restaurant portion, it's just two tables for four each.  They plan to expand to that soon, which I am definitely looking forward to, so I can bring some more friends (at the same time).  SERVICE  Good! There were numerous take out orders, so our orders came out a bit slower, but we accounted on that from the beginning. It was definitely worth it.  OTHER  Can't wait for them to expand seating area!  SUMMARY  Go here!"}
{"text":"Trying to get over a stubborn cold for the past couple of weeks and getting tired of Vietnamese Pho Ga. I popped in here for some frozen pierogi and a large container of cold borscht to go. I am not an expert on eastern European foods and have never had borscht before but I am a huge fan now!   Hearty, but not greasy, this soup hit the spot with its delicate pickle and dill balance. I can understand why this is a comfort food. In addition to the borscht I picked up frozen packages of the sauerkraut mushroom, and potato onion pierogi. I have eaten these in the restaurant pan fried in butter previously and they are delicious."}
{"text":"2nd time trying this place, Decent food service not good, not friendly at all no wonder NO ONE is ever here the 2 times I've come. This will be my last time due to the lack of friendliness of the sever."}
{"text":"Was hoping to try their everything. This food is outstanding. Their borscht leaves nothing to be desired. The pierogi are soft, thick, moist pillows of heaven. Get them to go, sit down or buy them frozen. Their selection of foods includes spicy sausage, taromasalata, alcohol free brews, desserts and sauces. These make an excellent late night dinner. The gentleman who served us was friendly and studious. We need more culture in Arizona and Ukrainians are fine by me!   After stuffing my face I made room for honey cake and dulce style pierogi. So worth it. Those dumplings are versatile. I recommend the blueberry or farmers cheese."}
{"text":"I can't believe I am the first to review this place.  The word needs to get out.  I can't tell you how good and fresh this food is.  Everything is made from scratch.  I try something new with each order and am always happy with the quality and taste.  The packaging is perfect, as I can eat or freeze it easily. (Most items freeze well)  The service is great, the delivery is timely and the price is right.  I look forward to getting my orders and can never resist trying a little bit of everything at once.  The pierogi are the best I've ever had and my daughter loves snacking on the hvorost.   Everything is homemade and so fresh.  You can taste the love and passion that goes into every item."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time recently and will make a return visit soon!  Went with the potato and cheddar pierogis and they brought back memories of when I had them growing up.  Had them pan fried and they come with tasty condiments to add on.  I would say an order of 6 is just enough for a meal.  Service was great as well."}
{"text":"So my husband being of Russian decent, loves pierogies. l have always had his \"family\" pierogi, which to me was always a bit drab, so my excitement to come here was quite low.  I purchased a groupon and we decided to take the drive from QC one Saturday. Upon arrival the hostess said they were not able to accept credit cards or the groupon due to their internet being down, not very happy, but since we drove there, we decided to stay, and after going next door for cash.  Thankfully the waitress explained the dishes and seemed to know about each one, and was apologetic for the card issue. We ordered several different pierogies with fillings, we were delighted with all choices, so much so,  we ordered the apple dessert ones after dinner, which were awesome too. I would have done 5 stars, but since we were somewhat inconvenienced with no card service and couldn't use groupon, I did 4"}
{"text":"This town is short on Polish restaurants, so maybe that's why everyone is giving this one such rave reviews?  Why 1 star?  Convoluted menu.  Ordering qty and picking more than 1 flavor will cost you a pretty penny and you have to decipher the pay scale they provided, way too complex.  You also have to order in 3s per flavor - which is what our waiter told us.  On top of that, they don't split the flavors so it's a gamble as to what it's inside your pierogi.  We ordered plain and potato and cheddar, they all tasted exactly the same.  Flavorless.  They also tasted way too tough.  My first thought is - did they open one of their frozen bags and use those for our dinner?  These did not taste fresh.  We were provided one carafe of water that filled 4 glasses half way full.  Our waiter never brought us refills.  Of course, not entirely his fault as he was the only waiter in the restaurant, which was clearly understaffed.  Four tables filled with dirty dishes since there was no busser available to clean them.  Just a poor dining experience.  Maybe my expectations were too high from all the 5 star reviews...  Or maybe it was just an off night.  I'll never know because nothing here was good enough to try again."}
{"text":"Great service! The food was delicious and the atmosphere is really inviting! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, excellent service, good value. The pierogis are fluffy and the sausage smokey. Amazing place and the offer a discount for returning customers."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go to this wonderful experience assisted by Groupon. We entered the Euro inspired restaurant not knowing what to expect, all we heard were the had the best pierogis! Never having tried pierogis, that's what we ordered, my wife had the potato ones and I had the pork. Both were delicious, she also had the meatballs in tomato sauce and had the kielabas. Service was excellent and atmosphere was enjoyable, put this one on your list if you're a foodie."}
{"text":"I just finished my meal and it was simply delicious. Next time I travel back to the Phoenix area, I'll be back."}
{"text":"So delicious. The sausage is amazing. Boiled or fried ps. It's really good. Family owned and everyone is super nice."}
{"text":"Thankfully I found this place to satisfy my Pierogi fix.  I usually buy around 8 dozen at a time.  They are exactly how my grandmother used to make them.  They have every kind of pierogi imaginable.  Personally, I love the sauerkraut / potato and cheese and any of them with bacon.  Natasha, the very passionate owner was even kind enough to make a special order with filling that I brought in.  Now that is customer service at its best.  Don't waste your time buying store bought pierogi's.  It is worth the trip to APK to stock up."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Shhh don't tell anyone :)"}
{"text":"Reminds me of my mom's homemade pierogi! I come here whenever I'm missing home. They have both sweet and savory pierogi! I personally like farmers cheese and potato. I like to purchase a couple frozen bags to take home. They are a bit pricey at $9.99 for a dozen, when you can buy cheese and potato ones at Costco for the same price but triple the amount. Anyways... I highly recommend coming here if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I came here with friends a few weeks ago after trying to find a fun and well-liked international restaurant. Whoever I spoke with on the phone to make the table reservation was kind, but it's weird they have a separate line for the market and the restaurant but they're connected.  It was fairly quiet the night we ate there so we had amazing service. Waitress was kind to go thru the menu and the pierogi options and her faves. Also -- they import Eastern European beer! Never had Russian beer before and it was great! She also kept the water glasses full. I ordered the Sausage & Pierogi plate, definitely worth every penny (especially after working out). Kept it safe by ordering all Cheese & Chive Pierogi. I didn't have any leftovers, but my friend did from his Combo Plate, who gave them to me for the next day (he's not a leftovers guy, but I AM!) I really liked the stuffed cabbage roll and their mushroom sauce- almost wish I would've ordered one fresh with dinner!   It's a little on the expensive side, but worth the price if you get one of the larger plates. Check in on Yelp during your first visit to get a % off food (no alcohol)!"}
{"text":"Another gem near my work..yay.. i really only give it 4 stars because its a bit pricy in my opinion. It is delicious and authentic and fresh! and i love the caramelized onions, bacon and sour cream with the pierogis! The green borscht is fantastic and so is the sausage dill soup. The cream fudge is amaaaazing. I cant wait to try more."}
{"text":"This place is pretty freaking bomb, went there for the lunch specials to try a few different things, perogis- bomb, sausage- bomb, cabbage beef roll with mushroom cream sauce holy cribbage!"}
{"text":"The good parts, cute place with a unique menu, friendly staff, awesome accents (from perogiland I'm sure) and good perogis.  I got an assortment of three kinds, and they were all a good spectrum of flavors.  I will come back for the rest. The bad parts were the lack of ambiance.  Some music other than the tv would have been really nice.  And I hate to say it, but the borscht was an aborschton.  See what I did there? But the waiters were the most attractive things I have ever seen, so....  it evened out."}
{"text":"A long-time friend who takes me out to dinner every birthday asked where I wanted to go this year. I picked a place I never heard of called \"All Pierogi Kitchen\". Wow. What a treat! I (we) had dill pickle soup with kielbasa, onion and potato. Main course dishes included kapusta zasmazana, go??bki, fresh homemade kielbasa, handmade pierogi (my choice was sauerkraut/mushroom and farmers cheese), placki kartoflane, and to drink a strong bitter soda pop made with rye bread. Thought we would have left-overs ... nope, not a crumb left.  All Pierogi Kitchen is located in a typical stripmall in Mesa. It's obvious they put some thought and effort into the place; it has a feeling of being well-established.  It feels very much family owned, which means some people will probably complain that they don't serve hamburgers and that their staff aren't pretentious pros.  There is no way you can fake ethnic foods from middle Europe, sorry, you can't just run down to Costco and buy a carton of pierogies. They have to be hand-made.  And unless you are an adventuresome person who routinely likes to try new and different foods, you are probably the opposite (like me) who was raised on these foods and you can't BS us ... it's either real and authentic or it's not.  And this place is real.  Now - is it as good as my mom or gramma used to make?  A bolt of lightning from Heaven would strike me down if I said it was as good, and yeah for me some of it was a little bland but not by a lot.  But I wasn't disappointed in anything except for one small quibble ... the ultra-tiny scoop of sauerkraut was ridiculously small. Sauerkraut is cheap and plentiful, why be so stingy with it?  Their menu isn't very deep, but that's okay, after all they do advertise that they specialize in pierogi. And some of their combinations left me wishing I could \"do it my way\" more ... and they make a big point of NO SUBSTITUTIONS, which is a shame at such a small place.  Price?  That's a quandary. Some people might find it slightly high. I didn't, you can and will pay a LOT more at places like Olive Garden, Denny's, Claim Jumper and other \"chain\" restaurants for me-too frozen food so I don't mind doing my part to keeping a local family business that cooks homemade fresh food in business. They need to make a profit because they can't buy truckloads of food at a time and in fact the percentage they pay for overhead is proportionately higher than national chains. I consider All Pierogi Kitchen's prices to be fair and the amount of food served to be a good value.  Oh yeah, one more thing. The accordion player. Try to be there when he is performing, he's very good and isn't so loud to be obtrusive. Everyone in the place seemed to know him and he was very friendly when he said hi to us.  Would I recommend anything to the owners?  Yes, two things ... please dim the lights a little.  And in winter please turn the heat up a little, our food got cold much too quickly in the chilly air.  All Pierogi Kitchen - highly recommended, will be back for sure."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Authentic fresh handmade food. Service was great. Some people that reviewed and complained about it being pricey are wrong. You get what you pay for and it's worth every penny"}
{"text":"I grew up eating Pierogis and love them. They have a great selection and they are outstanding! I love the Potato and cheddar, jalapeno and cheddar and potato and sauerkraut. They are a tad above average on the prices, but they are Pierogis, not many places out there do them. Small, clean, nice ma and pop ambiance. They have a market attached with a lot of cool Euro foods. You have to try this place once. I am going back for sure."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Pierogi's and salad here! The beef cabbage roll with tomato was good but needed more cabbage and less meat but still very good.  As for the potato pancakes, they were wayyy to salty.  Could not eat them and they were not crispy at all.  They seemed liked they were made ahead and reheated and salted a second or 3rd time.  I would not recommend them.  The service was fantastic!  Overall, great experience and would we would definitely return for the Pierogi's and Salad."}
{"text":"My wife and her brother are from Ukraine and all the food is truly legit. The place is small so you should order ahead ad everything takes time to prepare. Its worth the wait. The stuffed stuffed cabbage with chicken and potato Pierogi are awesome"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic, and the type of food you'll crave again! Had various pierogis and we enjoyed each flavor! Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!   The kielbasa is the best I've ever had! Pierogi's melt in your mouth.  I can not wait to come back to Phoenix, I will be planning a dinner here, for sure!"}
{"text":"We went with another couple and their 1 year old baby who was a bit hit with all the other patrons. I ordered the 6 pierogi plate with potato, cheddar and it came with tasty bacon, sour cream and saukerkraut. The star was definitely the saukerkraut. I also ordered a side of the smoked polish sausage with sauerkraut as well.  BF ordered the stuffed cabbage that came with pierogis and the lunch special with 6 pierogis that were all the same flavor. We devoured our plates. The place is adorable, deli style seating in the front and inside but very small, with giant shelves of pickled veggies and dips. Service was a little odd, it was a younger guy who had to do it all, take orders, bus and run out food. It was getting very busy around 1. Next time we are around we will have to stop in and buy the frozen ones.  It was a very chill lunch and happy to report that we will be back soon."}
{"text":"I grew up living with a Polish grandma eating Polish food.  The food here is lame in comparison.  No flavor in anything!  6 perogi for $11 and so small that two bites and they are gone..... and such a tiny dab of sour cream to go with them that it barely covered two of the perogis.  Portions are quite small for the price.  We also had the polish sausage with saurkraut stew---the meagerist portion you can imagine for $8.  After lunch here, we went to another place to fill up because getting any more bland food here at an exorbitant price was out of the question.  If you want real Polish, food this is not the place to go--spoken by a true Pole."}
{"text":"I love pierogi's. We showed up got a table and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. After 20 minutes (I'm really patient), I started waiving to get someones attention. Already I saw some people just get up and leave. Now I'm agitated. Not a great way to get a first impression or be in a mood to sample the food. Finally someone came over, took our order, and left. We did get our food, and I have to say the food was good. Not roll my eyes and say \"Oh My God!!\" good, but the food was good. That is why I'm giving 3 stars instead of negative 10. There are other good polish/european restaurants in this town, so I most likely won't be going back. My favorite is Touch of Europe in Oldtown Glendale. A little place, great service, great food that is run by a wonderful family. They take your order, cook the food and serve you. I recommend if you haven't found this little gem in Glendale you should."}
{"text":"For all of us familiar with Pierogis and kielbasa, this a rare find in AZ! Nice selection of pierogi plates and Slavic treats! Good service and warm, homey atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. They were a little understaffed when we came in, but they explained it to us so we knew what to expect. Then our server ended up staying late for us. She was so sweet!  The potato pancake combo was incredible. All of my favorite things: soft bread with crunchy crust, crispy potato pancakes, flavorful pierogis, and a giant kielbasa with all of the toppings. The beers are huge. The honey cake was good and not too sweet. Atmosphere was very pleasant. We will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"We've been wanting to come here ever since we moved to Mesa a little more than 2 years ago. Seems as tho something else always came up. I'm really glad we finally got here. We hope to come back a lot sooner.   The three of us ordered a Sampler Plate and 2 Combination Plates. We mixed what we ordered on each of them and tried samples of each other's.  The three of us liked everything we tried.  It was all just like I remember eating at home or grandmas when I was a kid.  At first I thought the prices were a bit high. But after the food came out and we saw the size of the portions and tasted the food we were satisfied the price was fair.  We all said we'd like to come back and bring friends."}
{"text":"Delicious food and really cool Eastern European market attached to it. The mystery pierogi plate is great if you don't know exactly what you want - the chef will pick different kinds for you to eat. Good and fast service. A little more olive oil on pierogi when served than I'd prefer. But overall delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place. The only place I've been able to find the stuffed cabbage or \"Sarmale\". Took my family here on my last visit to Arizona and everyone loved the food. We ordered multiple combo plates with the cabbage roll, sausage and pierogi... Fried of course. Sauerkraut and mushrooms, farmers cheese and chives and the other potato. All equally yummy. Looking forward to my next visit and another delicious meal."}
{"text":"Loved the food here! The pierogi and meatball plate was delicious and I would recommend to anyone who enjoys pierogis. The honey cake was also a unique dessert. I don't think I would get the cake again, but would definitely get the same entree next time.  The place is small and cozy and they had live entertainment when we were there. A guy was playing the accordion and it made the experience feel european and authentic.  The service can be a bit slow and the prices are a bit high for the type of food, which is why I took a star away.   Overall, good experience and we will return."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service . I got my food to go and the girl was so so so rude ! The food was soooooo expensive but I was craving it so was willing to pay for it , but the quantity was so small for the price and the food was just okay . I am 100% polish and I've had my fair share of polish food and this wasn't the best I've ever had. I'm just so mad at how rude the girl was I won't be back just because of her .  The food was worth possibly coming back but not the service ."}
{"text":"Great Eastern european cuisine, truly authentic dishes. Staff is friendly and helpful. The only thing is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Amazing food, the fresh bread is out of this world. They sell it at the market as well to take home for later, I need to buy two of those m3xt time."}
{"text":"This review isn't totally fair. I came here with the International Supper Club, which meant that I was part of a giant party on an already busy night. I can't be sure that this didn't affect the quality of our food. The husband and I split the beef combo plate (salad, beef cabbage roll, and 6 potato and cheese pierogis) and an order of blueberry pierogis. We were so excited for the blueberry pierogis since we hadn't seen them since we were last in Poland.The salad was a bit odd, it tasted like pickles, but good in its oddness. The cabbage roll was totally delicious, full of flavor and served with the perfect tomato sauce. The part we didn't love? The pierogis! The pierogis were somewhat doughy and chewy.... like they had been sitting out or something. Maybe it's because we got them fried, but they just didn't have a great texture. The potato ones were somewhat gluey inside and the blueberry ones exploded when you cut into them, leaving almost no filling inside the pierogi. Additionally, the blueberry pierogis were nothing like they were in Poland, but that could be due to the type of blueberry used. Anyway, I'll have to come back with a smaller party to see if it gets better.    PS the pricing structure was a bit odd, you could add 3 pierogis to our existing order for a small amount of money, but they couldn't be sweet pierogis because they had to cook them all together or something... this made no sense to me. Because of this, we had to order a separate plate for the blueberry pierogis which cost 11$.... not even close to worth it. The total bill was about 30$...a little ridic for what we got."}
{"text":"We were anxious to try this restaurant after being recommended by my Polish buddy. After being seated and provided with some beverages, we perused the menu. This restaurant has an odd pricing structure. If you want X number of pierogis of the same meat or vegetable stuffing they are a certain price. If you want a mix, e.g. 1 pork, 1 chicken, and 1 beef (there are many more to choose from), there's a up-charge. Really? Isn't a pierogi a pierogi a pierogi?   Our waitress recommended the Sampler ($24), which looked like a good mix of the items we wanted to try. It seemed to take a long time for food to be served, to the point where we both commented to each other about it.   Once the food came out, our waitress told us she couldn't tell us which pierogis were which on the plate. We figured it out by cutting them open. The food was very tasty, but was lukewarm at best.   Then came the bill. Remember, this was lunch... The $24 Beef Sampler Plate had jumped to $32 because of our mix-and-match flavoring of our 6 pierogis. Our waitress asked how everything was, and we commented that the food was just lukewarm, but tasted good, to which she commented that the food may have sat for awhile when she was taking a to-go order over the phone.   Overall, we were disappointed in the pricing and service."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place? A-MA-ZING!!! Cutest little place with nice soft lighting and the most delectable food! I ordered the Country Style Potato and Chedder Pierogi covered with caramelized onions and thick pieces of bacon! It comes with 18 pierogi!!! Yes! 18! Husband got the Sausage plate with Kielbasa and 6 sauerkraut and mushroom pierogi. The pierogi were like little soft pillows of heaven! Absolutely the BEST I have ever had. They have a little market right next door where we picked up some frozen pierogi to take home. They have a lot to choose from. We live out in the Surprise area but will definitely be back! Totally worth the drive!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite places to eat in the valley. Pierogis are really delicious as is their sausage and cabbage rolls."}
{"text":"The pierogi and pelmeni that I purchased here were very good.  The sauerkraut and mushroom pierogi were good, and the chicken pelmeni were good.  The attendant was Ukrainian.  She was nice.  She understood my broken Russian.  I have some Russian language skills."}
{"text":"Everything I had at this place was great! The staff was super friendly and the European market had tons of interesting items."}
{"text":"Huge perogi fan here. Love them. Back east there are always lots of places serving them, but none that I have known about here. Finally we have somewhere in the Phoenix area! I have eaten in (get them with everything) and taken the frozen ones home. The bags are a little expensive, but worth it. They have a lot of different flavors to try.   The lady running the place looks at me like I am crazy everytime I am in there. I am so enthusuastic about their food! They also have a number of other eastern European food items for purchase."}
{"text":"Being half Ukrainian and being raised with Ukrainian food... This restaurant is just as good as my Grandmother, my Mother and Fathers cooking! I recommend the borscht, beef cabbage roll and potato pancakes!! The service is very good.. A warm welcome and they make you feel at home.. We will be back many times more! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Did you know that October 8th is National Pierogi Day?  It doesn't really matter though because I wanted pierogis for dinner on Thursday so we headed over to All Pierogi Euro Kitchen & Euro Market.  It was a quiet evening and there were only a few other tables occupied when we walked in.  We were seated quickly and left to browse a very extensive menu.  Talk about information overload!  Between the two of us, we shared four different pierogis [cheddar & jalapeño, beef, farmer's cheese & potato, and sauerkraut & mushrooms]  The pierogis themselves were decent.  The filling was very light, delicate and subtle in flavor, and pan-fried a perfect crispiness.  My favorite out of all the flavors we tried is the cheddar & jalapeño.  That one had the boldest flavor and paired beautifully with the bacon and sour cream they serve on the side.  My least favorite would probably be the sauerkraut & mushrooms.  I found it to be an odd pairing but that's just me.  I should have stuck to cheese-fillings.  I also tried a few pierogis with the jarred hot mustard.  I'm not really a fan of it but my dinner companion loved that stuff.  All in all, 3.5 stars for All Pierogi Euro Kitchen & Euro Market.  The service could have been a better as it was a slow night and any time we needed something, we would have to practically wave down somebody."}
{"text":"Soooo good.  This place is the real deal for authentic Polish food.  Had the smoked sausage, stuffed cabbage and of course pierogi, which were all delicious-it was like being back home in Chicago.  Polish beer and wine available, and there's a store next door that carries frozen pierogis, canned goods and even Polish candy.  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The prices are a little high and I just bought a farmer cheese pierogi and they were extremely over salted! They used to be better when they first opened."}
{"text":"Awesomeness.  Delicious!!! Excellent value. Homemade everything.  You gotta go get your pierogi on!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing pierogis and a good selection of beers.  Very good food at a very good price.  Excited to have found this place!"}
{"text":"The dining area was recently expanded and includes many eastern-european favorites. Excellent service, try the sampler :)"}
{"text":"Great store and restaurant!!!  They sell delicious European ice cream called Dadu and cheesecakes. Their pierogies are the best."}
{"text":"Good food and very nice presentation...I wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"If you like Polish food you will like this restaurant. The menu is mostly made up of pierogi or combination plates with pierogi. They offer many types of pierogi either boiled or fried. I tried four different pierogi and enjoyed them all. My six dinner partners all enjoyed their meals, some of them having stuffed cabbage and kilbassa."}
{"text":"Recently my child and I were driving around looking for a meal when we saw this place next to Thai Basil. She's 1/4 Polish and I have eastern European ancestry, so we immediately started drooling. It was 5:30 and didn't realize they closed at 6pm. The very nice young lady behind the counter told me we'd be fine, so we ordered. She had two types of pierogi and I had pierogi and stuffed cabbage sampler with pork. OMG it was DELICIOUS! So good. I read another review that said stuff was cold or not tasty, but I have no idea why. These were tasty (not like spicy like Mexican stuff people expect around here), and everything is freshly made so obviously hot. I didn't mind the paper plates but the plastic knives were really flimsy. If you're going to have throw away utensils, pick a studier brand."}
{"text":"A big thank you to All Pierogi Euro Kitchen for hosting us for the November International Supper Club Unofficial Yelp Event (ISCUYE).  These folks adjusted to our growing party and dealt with 2 other large parties all in the same night.  I can't thank them enough for their patience and exemplary service.  Once again, the ISCUYE has located a delightful locally owned business in an unassuming strip mall with delicious food.  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers and their amazing pictures, I decided I had to try the Pierogi and after looking over the menu, I wanted a warm and soothing cup of Ukrainian style borscht.  Ukrainian style borscht is served warm and this cup of soup was a very interesting brothy soup with finely shredded hearty root and earthy vegetables like cabbage and beets.  Someone mentioned that they were concerned about an overpowering taste of beets and that was completely unfounded.  The dollop of sour cream was just enough to make the soup creamier and add a zip of \"zing\" to the soup.    I also enjoyed 2 different pierogis.  I tried the jalopeno and cheddar and the bacon.  Both very delicious.  These dumplings are very similar to the Japanese Gyoza, except the Japanese dumpling is thinner.  The Pierogi is made with a thicker dough.  The Pierogi can be boiled or fried.  This restaurant serves them in multiples of 3 with a side of bacon bits (yummy!!), sour cream and roasted onions.    Give this place a try!  You will not be disappointed.   Return Factor: 85%"}
{"text":"Never had Pierogi before (other than from a bag from Costco) and I liked it!  It was fun to try this place, even if at the time it was tiny and more of a grocery store than a restaurant. But I just drove by and see they have expanded, so I can't wait to go again. The menu at the time was hard to figure out, but we accomplished that and ended up eating a lot of different things."}
