{"text":"Nice decor. Reasonable price. Decent food considering in Aurora.  Authentic Cantonese food.  You can tell family run...Grand parents are helping out."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout for dinner. Called in advance and was told it would be ready in 10 mins. Walked over from our house and it was ready when we arrived. Owner was friendly when we ordered. 

We tried the sweet and sour pork with rice - it was crispy and tasty but had a bit too much batter.

Also tried the satay beef fried rice noodle which was a bit too saucy but overall good. 

We would come again as it was a good experience. 

Now that there is a full menu we look forward to trying other dishes."}
{"text":"nice small restaurant tucked in a corner plaza.  very spacious (i wonder why there is a sign saying \"occupancy load 36\"???.... they can only have 36 sit in customers??!!!  anyways,  menu is limited for now... no beverages available even.  
food is good and hot.  stir fried dishes not oily at all.  very promising place.  looking forward to its fuller menu."}
{"text":"My first time here food was great!! Service just as good.price was $40 dollars for a two person combo we left full and took plenty home enough to feed two again!!!!"}
{"text":"Never imagine there could be an authentic Chinese restaurant. All taste amazing. Must come."}
{"text":"Must try new Chinese restaurant in Aurora!!!

We ordered the Oyster & Minced Pork with Rice in Soup and the Stir Fry Beef Flat Rice Noodle (Dry). 
Both dishes were on par with what you can get in Richmond Hill and Markham!
Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese food! Fast service. Not salty. The waitress is very friendly and very attentive. Will
Definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now and have noticed improvements by the staff with each visit.  The food has always been great and the staff has always been friendly and patient.  The first few times we came here the food came out slow and many menu items were not available because they didn't have main ingredients.  The last time we visited the restaurant, the food came out quick.  Our favourite item here is definitely the steamed chicken!  Sounds simple, but so delicious!"}
{"text":"It's great for a quick Chinese fix when you're up in York region area. Won't have to go down to Markham! It was a little odd that the set dishes for 4,6,8 people etc. are not available for dinner when that's usually when people would order these.. ? Either way the portions, while not as large as say congee queen, are definitely just as yummy and a good value."}
{"text":"Love to have a nice Chinese restaurant in Aurora. Have been here few times and every time I am pleased with the food. Food always come out hot and fresh, not too oily is the key so my little one can eat too! So glad we have a Chinese restaurant close by that also serves good food."}
{"text":"I'm new to the Aurora/Newmarket area and I think I just found a go-to place for Chinese food takeout.  Although I haven't tried any other dishes other than a few items takeout, I can certainly tell that the taste is great and I can assume that other dishes won't be too bad either.  The lunch takeout I got even has free drinks included.

It's a newly opened restaurant, not too big but not too small and it's located inside a brand new plaza.  The service is great, the boss was nice, he seemed to appreciate your business.  While waiting for the take out, I was offered tea.  I didn't call ahead to order but the food came out pretty fast.  This is not a place where you would go for formal dinner, it's more like a Hong Kong tea house style restaurant."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised with the quality and flavours of the food. Menu could have more selection of dishes with the set dinners, but the food is authentic and tastes like what you would get in Markham or Richmond Hill. Restaurant itself has nice decor and is not too crowded."}
{"text":"Really like this place,so glad finally there is an authentic Chinese restaurant opened in Aurora"}
{"text":"Affordable | Good value | Small Menu | Quick Chinese fix | LLBO

If you're looking for good value Chinese food, this is the place. Their combos divided up is less than $10 a dish. The combos even come with a few nice bowls of rice. 

The quality of food is not bad either. The sweet and sour pork are cut small and are crunchy.

Their combos though does not come with soup.

Their menu isn't as big as your typical Chinese restaurant in Toronto but it's a mix of HK style cafe and Chinese seafood restaurants.

Overall, I'd come back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"So glad to see a new Chinese restaurant in Aurora! It's a small family run restaurant in the plaza at william graham and st.john's sideroad.

I have visited multiple times since it opened. I have tried their seafood fried rice, fried noodles, sweet and sour pork with rice, their soups, and more. All of them tasted great! Not too salty..not too oily! 

The service is wonderful. They are attentive and friendly! 

The restaurant is clean and family-friendly. It's very spacious!

I'm hoping they will soon add some \"Chinese afternoon tea\" items to their menu! This is definitely my new go-to restaurant whenever I'm feeling too lazy to cook!"}
{"text":"There is no other place of its kind in the aurora/Newmarket area which makes for a great edge to the business as a Hong Kong style cafe.

We had a table of ten but that did not affect the service or pace of the food which was great, the only thing was that we asked for separate bills at the end of the meal which was a roomy mistake by us, which made the waitress much slower at getting us out at the end of our meal. Next time I have a big group I will remember to ask for separate bills at the beginning :) 

Between 11:30am and 2:30pm is their lunch special which includes a free milk tea, coffee or soup. The downside is if you want both soup and tea you will have to pay extra 2.50$ however, the soup by itself is 6.99 so you have to watch out how they enter it into the system if they don't add the soup as the free item.

The soup was a black chicken broth which was very tasty, not too salty and large. The milk tea was standard. I had the satay beef rice noodle which was very tasty, HUGE for a lunch portion! I couldn't finish of course....the beef scrambled egg noodle was just as tasty. The chicken steak with curry sauce was very moist but the chicken was quite fatty? I like fat though....

The shrimp fried rice was very dry :( will not order that again. 

I also ordered a cold lemon tea and it was abut watery? Maybe because there was only two slices of lemon?

I will return!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! It's small and cozy, the way I like it! Everything is clean, so that's extra! The tables are arranged in such a way that there is a lot of open space. I personally like it the way it is, so it avoids over crowding. I'm here at least once a week and every visit has been the same - awesome. The owner is super and deserves a medal! He is super polite and attentive, something a lot of restaurant owners need to learn. It's a family operated place, so you'll see grandma and grandpa helping out. I like that touch.. 

The food has been consistent with every visit. I try to order something different every time I go, but I find myself always getting the fish and tofu hot pot.. It's just awesome! They also have a chicken steak that's really delicious. It comes with black pepper sauce or curry. So many things to try still.. Right now I'll give them 5 stars. Pricing is reasonable and portion is good. Also, it's CLEAN! :)"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese like you would get in China but would definitely not recommend takeout as the containers are small and significantly overpriced.  Chinese broccoli was only half filled.  The servings in the restaurant are  generous. Noodles are good.  Seafood soup had only those teensy tiny shrimp that come in a jar and at $17 for a large bowl was way overpriced. The restaurant did not feel not very welcoming.  The waitress did her job but that was all and we were the only customers for most of lunch."}
{"text":"This is the best Hong Kong style Chinese restaurant in all of Aurora Newmarket area. It serves authentic Chinese food comparable to what one would find in Scarborough, Markham or Richmond Hill. Other Chinese restaurants in the area, with exception of Asian cuisine, serves more westernized styles of Chinese food. 

I've visited this place on at least 5 occasions and have ordered a wide variety of dishes, including the chicken which comes with set menu, fried rice, fried noodles and assortment of entrees. The owners have steadily improved the flavor and increased portions steadily since it first opened. I've found the food to be slightly less salty in flavor as well, which suites my taste buds. 

Just like many Chinese restaurants throughout gta, the increased minimum wage, rising cost of ingredients and higher rent has forced it to cut back on amount of meat, seafood or veggies found in most dishes.

If you are eating with more than one person, I strongly recommend ordering any plate of rice or noodles with a plate of seafood or meat to supplement."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant since they first opened. Pretty decent for Chinese food in the area. The shrimp fried rice is pretty amazing. Also the fried tofu with soy sauce. To die for omg!! I would say this is one of the best Chinese Asian restaurants in the area. A lot of parking on site and easy to find. I did take out before as well and they gave you a complimentary soup! Amazing! :)"}
{"text":"Great service, food was good  only good Chinese food around Aurora  check it out if ur in town"}
{"text":"Definitely is very convenient to eat here. Situated where the new housing area is in Aurora. 

Food: good for a fusion flavour concept, meaning that the food is the usual Asian dishes but not quite as flavourful as dishes you might taste in Scarborough/ Richmond Hill restaurant. 

Atmosphere: limited seats, probably 12-14 tables of 2- 4-people each. The decor was cool. 

The service was a bit slow, but not rude. All you need right? We ordered something but what came to us was not what we expected. No matter, food still good. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. The food was very salty and had a lot of MSG. The noodle dish we had was over cooked and the noodles were mushy. They also use a ton of oil. The take out containers had a layer of cook at the bottom."}
{"text":"Go north to Newmarket (border) for decent Chinese food?   Decor is quite unique and nice-rustic with an Asian touch!   The food quality and taste is quite good.  Tasty and decent portion sizes.   Not overly greasy and food temperature is good.  The menu is not as extensive as some of the other restaurants but if we had to sacrifice quantity for quality, I like this better.  The choices are more \"basic\" than exotic but that is fine!  This is not a very large restaurant-think of it as a cross between a cafe and restaurant.   It's a good choice for authentic Chinese food in Newmarket.  As a matter of fact, they will hold their own when you compare them to Markham/Richmond Hill places too!"}
{"text":"We we're craving Chinese food and we happened to stumble across this place. It's a small restaurant, clean, and the server was really polite. We ordered the salty fish and chicken fried rice, decided to get it spicy for an extra $1, and the salt and pepper porkchop. Their service is extremely fast, not sure if it's always like this or if it's because it wasn't as busy, but both dishes came out in 15 min. The fried rice was exactly the same quality I get in Markham restaurants, which is amazing. Although it wasn't very spicy the flavours of the salty fish were there. The salt and pepper pork chop were a little greasy and the majority of it was bones but the meaty parts were very flavourful. Overall it was a good and satisfying meal and would definitely return"}
{"text":"This is the real deal.  I mean it is authentic, Richmond Hill/ Markham style Chinese food without the drive into mayhem.  I was here once before, but forgot to report.  Then St John's Sideroad closed for construction and I never remembered the place.  But I'm back--in a big way.

I stopped in on a drizzly night just before the supper hour.  It took all of 3 seconds to determine the menu was made up of real Chinese dishes.  From my beloved noodle soups, a main reason to stop by for a late snack, and noodle and rice dishes to the hot pots, there is a lot to like.

I ordered the Beef Brisket with Radish Hot Pot, which is essentially a stew of sorts.  I am very familiar with this dish, and this one was extremely authentic.  For example, the tender brisket included tendon, lots of Lo Bok and a great gravy.  I cleaned up the pot, and then scooped the remaining gravy onto my remaining rice and hoovered down the works.

This one dish meal filled me up but I need to mention that after I ordered, the server brought me a pot of tea and a big bowl of delicious \"Lai Tong\" or \"soup of the day\".  Fantastic on a chilly night, and just delicious. And filling.  Glad and sorry I didn't order more dishes.  I will need to go back. At least weekly.  At least.

There are no equivalent options in Aurora or Newmarket since Chitose closed.  The don't do AYCE, or sushi, but most real Chinese restaurants don't. I am going to work through this menu--repeatedly!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have come here in the last month since it's the only real Chinese cha Chang tang (HK style cafe)... and to be honest, they are a work in progress. The first visit was simply horrendous. The food was mediocre, the drinks were tasteless and service was slow, however, it was understandable as the owner was the only front line worker and he made the effort to come talk to us and ask for feedback. Each other time we came back, the owner would continue to ask for feedback and we discovered a few good dishes. The fried noodles with bean sprouts and chicken steak with pepper sauce are exceptionally good. On this visit, we tried the vermicelli in pepper and pork belly soup with a side of grilled chicken. The vermicelli is a bit hard but the soup was very peppery and tasty. Again still a work in progress but the waiting staff is nice and accommodating.  We will continue to return because of a mix of convenience and feeling valued as a customer"}
{"text":"Went in today for the first time, got the stir fry beef flat noodles (dry) and was good for sure, way way better then markham and RH ones and also the waitress came to give you a drink for take out customers, other places down south all the waitresses will just stand around and talk shit, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I think because there's no decent chinese restaurant Aurora, this place has quickly become popular.  I went there with my mom during the soft opening, the owner was really nice and asked me for tips and comments. I even told him where to find some food supplier but in short, I tried their stir-fry dish i.e. Fried rice dish-they are good. More on the oily side but yummy in taste.  Food selection was limited but I think they were in the process of developing more items on the menu.  The restaurant is not HK cafe style but kind of in between casual and a proper sit down restaurant so it confused me a little.  The interior decor is actually quite nice and unique-which surprised me.  But if u r looking for certain dishes or certain type of HK style cuisine or Chinese food then maybe u should head down to Markham or Richmond Hill for authentic dishes."}
{"text":"Travelled up north for Chinese food.. What.?! That's right.. Instead of heading down to Markham for food we came up here upon a recommended from a family friend and we definitely not disappointed. 

This restaurant is located in a new plaza with construction all around..so will take a little time to pick up.

We ordered the 4 dish combo which is served with steamed rice. Everything we ordered was great, flavourful and not too oily. I am very impressed!

The service was great as well which is rare for Chinese food! I can definitely see myself becoming a regular here."}
{"text":"Very authentic and reasonably priced. A good variety of foods. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"So glad we tried this place...it's like 5 minutes from our house!  Fantastic, fresh made Chinese food...lots of choice for sure and very well priced.  The eggplant hotpot with minced pork is a winner and I loved the Royal Chicken (served cold so you know).  Lots of fresh veggies in the dishes too and not just a few random onions and peppers.  It seems like the locals are starting to embrace this place, which is great because we don't have anything else like it in the area.  If you're in Aurora, give it a shot.  You can get a half chicken with 3 other dishes and rice for $40 and it more than feeds 3 people."}
{"text":"It has been one year since New Fusion has open its doors in our local Aurora community :) They have finally branded themselves away from what we used to think as a Chiu-Chow styled restaurant. Now they have flourished into a fully running authentic Chinese restaurant where they offer seasonal seafood, delicious wok-fried dishes, while still offering many homey, comfort food I love.

To celebrate their 1st Year Anniversary, the restaurant is introducing NEW Family Combos with affordable prices - starting at $58 for Special Combo for 2-4 people. This combo includes Seafood Soup, Ginger Scallion Lobster, Half Royal Chicken, King Mushroom with sliced fish, Pea Sprout in Garlic soup, and complimentary dessert.

YOU HAVE TO STAY FOR DESSERT. Holy shit, that complimentary almond paste with egg white dessert is the BEST I've ever had. It is silky smooth and not too sweet; perfect way to end off a meal :)

New Fusion will continue to be my all-time go-to spot for Chinese food; it is my home away from home :) Scrambled eggs with shrimp, Deep fried fish fillet in sweet corn sauce, Beef brisket with flat rice noodles in soup are amongst my personal faves. I would highly recommend this restaurant, and I hope to see you there too ^^

{"text":"SO good its our new go to place in Aurora.  The sweetest and sour pork is wonderful.  I actually wasn't going to write this review because I don't want too many people to go there so I don't have a long line up LOL!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here for our first night in Toronto. The menu looks great, but the noodle is more Hongkong style, quite plain and not much taste. 1st time I didn't finished the noodle soup. But the beaf stew is good.."}
{"text":"Decided to do take out and was very very disappointed about my order. I definitely will not be coming back here. I ordered the beef brisket and tendon rice noodle soup for my mom and I but when I got home and opened our order to find out they didn't use the normal fat rice noodles we always get. Instead they gave us half cooked vermicelli rice noodles which were disgusting. The noodles aren't even soft and doesn't taste good. My mom threw out her soup and I can't finish mine because it just doesn't taste the same. I thought I was super clear on my order but so much for take out on a Friday night. Complete garbage.

Before, I gave this place a three star when my boyfriend and I ate in. My three stars going to one. So upset they messed up my simple order that I will definitely not be coming back anymore. Even more upset that I tipped them because I was in a happy mood picking up my favourite fat rice noodle soup. Lesson learned, never coming back here again. Better to drive 20 minutes to Markham to have my order correct the first time. Super angry face. If there was an option to give no stars, this would be my first review to give no stars."}
{"text":"The food is tasty.
I got the black pepper pork chops. Sauce is on the spot. Pork chops are generous in size. 
Looking for more veggies than two pieces of cucumbers. 
The milk tea was weak, wasn't HK style milk tea - the drink lost one star. 
But overall decent place."}
{"text":"I gotta cut this place some slack, I was going to give them a 1 star but I didn't want to be completely rude. 

This spot is only 2 mins away from my girlfriends place and never knew it existed until we looked around on help for Chinese food. The reviews were really good so we decided to check it out. First off the menu is an old school type of menu which I thought this place was \"New Fusion\" whatever that means. The menu has no pictures which really sucks because I don't know what I'm getting. Looked on yelp and had to refer to the pictures

Got the sweet and sour fish which said \"must order\" on the picture and lemme tell you the fish was bland no taste and drenched in a cheap sweet and sour sauce. Lol I was actually amazed at how terrible it was. 

My girlfriend ordered the beef brisket noodle with tendon one of the first pictures you see in the yelp photos and the beef was sooo tough my jaw hurt and spat it out. Each beef piece wasn't cooked properly. And the soup tasted like bland chicken broth... seems like they don't add salt to anything. Even the complimentary soup that's given right after you place your order. 

The female waitress who wasn't our waitress was really nice and the guy with glasses was really good at being serious and intimidating and cleaning the tables. 

The decor was nice, nice vibe of the restaurant, nice open space you can actually move around. But the food, wasn't anywhere close to Chinese food. I'd rather go to Manchu wok any day of the week instead of this place. Will I come back? Never again."}
{"text":"Hard to believe! But I did drive all the way from Markham to eat at New Fusion Restaurant.

Came with a low expectation but was pleasantly surprised. 

We ordered 
- Sweet and Sour Chicken with Rice: Love how they used fresh pineapple of the canned variety! The batter is thin and crunchy and all the pieces never turned soggy! The sauce has this nice balance and honestly, this is one of the best ones I had in GTA.

- Fried Rice Noodle with Beef: It has a nice hot off the wok aroma. But sadly the beef was overcooked and dry. This might be a pass for me.

The above comes with Soup of the Day and a Choice of drink

New Fusion Restaurant probably the best choice of Chinese food in the area. I would even gladly drive up to try other dish. 

Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Finally an authentic Chinese restaurant in Aurora. Small, family run business. Menu is limited but they plan to expand. Surprisely quite busy seeing that they just opened. We ordered 3 noodle dishes for takeout: Cantonese chow mein was crispy, satay beef noodle was tasty, and the dry beef noodle still had a nice chew. All well done and not oily. The only downside is they don't give a lot of stuff (meat and vegetable) to go on the noodles."}
{"text":"I found this place last week and now my go to place for lunch. I believe this place just opened recently but already has a lot of customers. 

The noodle soup was fantastic and I will definitely go here again. 

I will highly recommend everyone to try this place if you are close by. Thank you to owner and the chefs! Great job.."}
{"text":"There isn't much choice in HK style cafes in Aurora and I've been here a few times since I haven't had a bad experience. 

However, that changed just a smidge yesterday. The pork chop with rice seemed thinner than before and the whole afternoon there was an aftertaste in my mouth and I was so thirsty. Guess they were a little heavy handed with the MSG."}
{"text":"New gem in Newmarket -- pretty darn good Chinese food (not the fake chop suey kind - but more authentic Szechuan) and the building is brand new so everything is ultra clean!

Family friendly also, they have a dedicated room with change pad for kids and parents.

Prices are on the higher side but that makes up for not having to drive down to highway 7.

Would recommend their eggplant hot pot, all their soups, and fried cantonese style noodles!"}
{"text":"This new place is not bad, but I have trouble to understanding how they set their price on small item.  I cannot believed that they charged me $9.95 plus tax for an afternoon tea of instant noodle with luncheon meat and egg, plus milk tea. The combination in Richmond Hill is normally $6 or so.  
Nevertheless, the owner is a serious man try to run this business with good food and reasonable price for most of the menu. I try a several time there, and I found their food are good standing in general.  BTW, the waitress definitely has room to improve.
I wish their business running well and continue to improve."}
