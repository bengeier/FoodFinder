{"text":"Very good foods. Owners are superb nice. Parisian omelet is to die for... Cozy atmosphere. Reminds me of the cafe I frequented in Paris."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Very nice place to stop. Very good coffee and the kids breakfast is very nice for kids. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"This place has really good food, friendly staff, and great ambience, but lately it has developed a very annoying habit. For reasons that are unclear, the servers begin trying to clear plates LONG before a diner is even close to being done eating. And they do it repeatedly during the same meal.  This has happened on at least my last four visits, and it's aggravating. I don't understand the point of it. Do they not have enough dishes? Please lighten up, Fame waitstaff. You're working people's nerves."}
{"text":"Came in today with my mom to grab breakfast and coffee. I ordered an iced coconut mocha and the breakfast sandwich when I ordered the woman taking my order asked me if I was ok with bacon I told her yes she took my moms order which was a parfait and a honey latte my mom asked if she could have it in a medium cup the woman told us they have only two sizes of coffee cups both glass mugs and if she wanted a medium cup it would be in a medium Togo coffee cup not in a class cup and then asked if we wanted her parfait Togo as well. We told her no . We sat down a red headed waitress came and brought my moms parfait and my coffee I tried my coffee and it didn't have any coconut flavoring I went to the register and asked what was In the coffee she told me chocolate and coconut milk I asked to make it sweeter the woman recommended vanilla flavoring I tried it it still wasn't sweet enough so I asked for more sweetener i took it back to my seat waited another 10 minutes and I noticed that a group of people who came in after us already had their food I stopped the red headed waitress and asked about my breakfast sandwich she said she'd check. A guy waiter came up to us to take our table number away we explained I was waiting on a breakfast sandwich. The red headed waitress came back and explained to us that the woman who took our order said we never ordered a sandwich. I told them to cancel it at this point I was frustrated and since my drink still wasn't right I asked for a refund. The red headed waitress was super rude and wanted an explanation as to why. I told her and gave her my card she walked away and then came back explaining that she didn't need my card to do a refund. The manager brought back my receipt with the refund. We left. rather then being heard or accommodated they were rude and because of that I'll never go back. I work in customer service for a large corporation and this is a prime example of how NOT to handle an employee mistake. I get it shit happens but if the employees wanted to make it right they could've rather then blaming me and telling me I didn't order something. Bye Felicia!"}
{"text":"Working here today...  they have delicious tea with free refills and I enjoyed a generous portion salad with crispy salmon on top.  Less pretentious and cleaner than Lux and good music. Only Complaint - power is hard to plug into.   Yum! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ok, this place was ridiculously delicious! I was in town for a steppin event (that's ballroom Chicago style steppin for ye un-initiated); I love to hit up yelp to find the great places for breakfast because when I'm out partying all night, breakfast is the only meal I know I'll be able to fit in, so I make it a point to find the spot.. and this was it... I ate here 2 mornings in a row.. sat and sun, and  went back on Monday but dang it! it was closed! great twist on French staples - croque monsieur et madame, as well as some really tasty salads, which I ordered to go to save for later in the day. really great food, decent portions, not too hurtful on the wallet, nice outdoor seating with swamp coolers... I will definitely return here every time I'm back in town. I might even have to fake a business reason to go to phoenix just so I can eat here again! And, the coffee was pretty good too..."}
{"text":"Cute place, friendly staff, GREAT food. Very laid back and comfortable. The Bloody Mary I got was really tasty. Pretty picky about my bloodys but this one was perfect. Id give it a 5 star rating for the area but over all a 4. I'll be going back forsure."}
{"text":"Quaint place. Very busy. I had the FáMe omelet and my daughter had the Greek yogurt with fruit and honey. The omelet was surprisingly small given the price. The scallions listed on the menu board were really just a shaving on top. The outside of the omelet had a great texture and was velvety. No idea how that's done, very impressed. Inside the omelet was kind of a mess. Lots of water meaning the tomatoes were not cooked/cooked enough and thus the heat caused them to \"water out\" the entire inside of the omelet. Bummer. The ham was perfectly cubed which leads me to believe it's just restaurant style cubed ham and not something local. $9.95 for an omelet, especially at this size could still be successful when *excellent ingredients* are used and prepared correctly. It didn't really explode with taste. Not a terrible omelet but a real let down. The bacon included was medium grade supermarket bacon that was almost too moist, meaning it's pre cooked and kept in a steamer. The Fry's Black Label I buy tastes much better to me. Why not just cook it to order?  The $9 jar of Greek yogurt, honey and berries was nice. The berries were fresh BUT no one bothered to de-stem/core the strawberries. My culinary training consists of 4 years of Jack in the Box and even I Know that strawberries, like apples, pears, etc NEED TO BE CORED. Outside of this it was quite nice. Refreshing.  The staff was super nice. Kudos for that. A bad/lackluster meal can be upped a star for good service and smiling, knowledgable staff. Hence the 3rd star.  In all, I'd be willing to come back. I personally think my omelets are every bit as good, if not better (though the outer texture of the FáMe omelet was sublime), and for the price, disappointing in execution and portion size. The ownership might want to have breakfast at Luci's and take some notes.   Hopefully next time things will be better. I really want to like this place."}
{"text":"Cute ambiance and decent food--the first time we went, I had a sandwich that was meh, but fresh.  Today, I had the breakfast sandwich with bacon, which was quite delicious, but nearly $9!  I thought that was excessive for a regular old breakfast sandwich (eggs, cheese & bacon) that came with a small side of fruit.  Their chocolate chip scones are delicious (though a little small), but they're $3, which is a lot for the size.  I've gone back on more than one occasion, though, for scones in particular because their so good.  Not sure if that will continue for the price, though, once my pregnancy cravings subside.  Overall, Fa-me has some high and low points, but ultimately, the reason for my lower review is the price--I'm just not sure the food is worth the expense."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The staff are WONDERFUL. The atmosphere is pleasant. The prices are great. Our group was visiting for 4 days, and we were there every day for brunch. I highly recommend this business."}
{"text":"I've been driving by every morning for weeks and finally stopped for breakfast. Expectations exceeded!!! Ordered the Parisian omelette which was amazing...light & fluffy and cooked to perfection! Coffee was delicious and they offer coconut & almond milk. I'll definitely return for breakfast and lunch in the near future!"}
{"text":"Finally someone is giving Lux a run for their money. Their espresso is smooth--not bitter--perfectly pulled. The two eggs any style plate was absolutely delicious, with scrambled eggs garnished with green onion,  two strips of crisp bacon, and a fresh fruit cup of strawberries, grapes, and pears. Toast on house made bread. I have been here a few times so far and it is my new favorite spot. The ambiance is calm and inviting. Everything is spotlessly clean and the service is fast and friendly. You should go!"}
{"text":"Live near Fame and I work from home - but I don't actually like working at home - so I thought I would try Fame as a go-to for work and coffee meetings. I really wanted to like it and so far so good, but when I sat down to get to work there was no internet connection. Turns out their wi-fi doesn't work. So I was stuck moving to another coffee shop and having to buy another cup of coffee.   Coffee at Fame was pretty good as well as the environment, but I was already a little frustrated.  Maybe I'll try it again when they figure it out."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Saturday afternoon around 12pm.  Pros:  *staff found a table for us while we were in line  *food was out within 15 minutes *portions were large *food presentation was appealing  *healthy options available   Cons  *very long line *small writing of the menu on a chalkboard  *somewhat a smaller outdoor dining area, as in the other tables were close enough to comment on our conversation"}
{"text":"Love the food but the prices are a bit off. For instance the sides with the sandwich were cut out and a 9 dollar sandwich  with no side on a small plate looks a little small if you know what I mean...it looks lonely..that small sandwich  all by itself. .Used to be a choice of salad  or fries etc.  Miss that.  And why paper towels and not napkins..? Great food tho. And lovely decor."}
{"text":"I was just in and ordered two Dirty Chai teas and  the barista asked how many espresso shots I wanted. I thought a Dirty Chai was 2 espresso shots?!?! I leave to find that these taste nothing like Chai. I called and they connected me to the Barista who said this is their chai recipe and he just adds the espresso. Well... This tastes nothing like a chai and is much more like a latte! Will not be ordering any type of chai from Fa me!"}
{"text":"We found our new favorite brunch place! The buttermilk pancakes were not only my favorite in the valley but were also made using all organic and humane ingredients. We are in love with the decor, music and most importantly the fantastic food!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, overly filling portions so might be wise to share and order more after if you choose.  Great coffee and fantastic friendly service!!  I go here by myself or with others.  I much prefer it over Lux anytime!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, delicious food. Highly recommend this place! Try the pancakes...nothing fancy, but I'm not even a pancake person and they are to die for. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and treat yourself to an espresso drink from the coffee bar too...worth it! Staff is always great as well. So glad this place opened, even if I'm still not quite sure how to pronounce their name."}
{"text":"My mother and I split the Fame Omelet and it was fantastic! Everything down to the potatoes and toast were wonderfully tasty! We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on my way out of town before a long trip and was BEYOND pleased.  First of all, the interior and ambiance was amazing! The dining area was also super clean, tidy and welcoming; major bonus!  Right when I walked in I was greeted by the young girl at the register. She had a lot of knowledge on the menu items and the restaurants farm to table concept. She talked me through some of her favorites as well as the restaurants most popular items. Despite my thousands of questions and indecisiveness, she happily helped me land on the Frenchie Toast with a side of bacon, a latte and some fresh squeezed orange juice! Let me tell you, I was NOT disappointed! The french toast was just as described; crunchy crust, chewy center, but LOADED with yummy flavors. The bacon is to die for. Seriously. Do not leave Fàme without getting a piece (or 10) of that stuff. The barista, William, did an amazing job on the latte... best one I've had in Phoenix! Don't let the price of the fresh-squeezed juices put you off. After one sip, all of my doubts on the price and quality of the ingredients went away.   Throughout my meal I was checked on multiple times, which was nice for a counter service restaurant.  Overall, Fàme should definitely be a Phoenix favorite! Between the service, quality food and happy environment, there's no better place to be!"}
{"text":"Great for breakfast and lunch. Loving the atmosphere and the staff is so friendly and make you feel at home. Such a cozy little spot to do work or even homework since they have complimentary wifi. Now, back to the food. Breakfast is on point, their french toast is the best french toast in Arizona by far. They have generous portions and the fact that they changed their menu in order to personalize it to the costumers liking is great! You feel at home the moment you walk in through the door, I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The coffee is wonderful! Doesn't taste like burnt beans.   Staff is friendly and approachable. I believe we also met I think the owner who was super nice. Big crowd on Sundays earlier in the morning."}
{"text":"We have been dining here for quite some time and have a favorite in the fried cawliflower!! Very unique and tasty..dont be afraid of it.. simply amazing!! Love the omelets and sandwiches..always fresh, always sweet environment, and always consistent. Love Maria and Ivan!  Thank you for your passion for good food and compassion toward your customers."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! Delicious and healthy. Made fresh so you won't have any health issues eating here. I'm particular with what I eat, but this place was great. The staff is so friendly and the owners are very pleasant. If you want food cooked properly with excellent service, this is the place!! Pa. You have to see Tuey, she is amazing!! So sweet and real!! Excellent"}
{"text":"Super cute, newer little place on Central. Small menu  Everyone was friendly. Overall underwhelming. Nothing was bad but nothing was great for breakfast either. Somewhat plain, sparse plates. Basic food that tastes good but seemed pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Excellent place to meet for brunch or simply enjoy a latte with pastry. Friendly staff, great decor and atmosphere. All pastries are made in-house, which is really impressive considering the selection. The regular coffee was a little weak for my taste, but the latte was very good. I'm not sure why my latte was served in a to-go cup when I was staying, but I am thinking they assumed it was to-go. I tried their breakfast sandwich with bacon and avocado, and it was delicious and VERY filling. I'll be back again and again to try other options, and if they make their regular coffee a litter stronger I'd give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast with my family before they went back to Texas and it was the perfect spot. The food taste absolutely amazing and the service is up there as well. I personally changed the order that I got and the cooks in the back got everything correct. The coffee is also very good and everything is organic.   I typically do not like spending money at restaurants because I am cheap but I will have to make an exception for this place every now and then. Definitely get there early too because it will get busy pretty quickly."}
{"text":"If you're looking for excellent northwest quality coffee, this is not going to please your tastebuds. The vanilla used was not real and they only put one shot of espresso in a 16oz size for their vanilla lattes. I was pleased with the owners response to my feedback and he refunded me."}
{"text":"Mind you, I'm a little bit partial to this restaurant because we did quite a bit of work for them on the reclaimed wood, communal dining table and light fixture, as well as some other odds and ends, but all that being said... we've been going there almost every Sunday for brunch. I could go on about the food, it's wonderful. I could go on about the location, it's very convenient for me. I could go on about the ambiance, they have paid attention to the cute little details that most people overlook. However, the thing that stands out the most is that we love going in and giving a big hug to the owners and seeing how happy they are doing what they do. They're extraordinarily friendly, and not in a weirdo way... They are just truly spectacular people, and it shows in the way they take care of you there. Everyone we've referred there has loved it and we've seen them pop in with other friends they're referring unexpectedly. We get to hang out at the big communal table in the center and end up joining friends like it's a family get-together. I love Phoenix. I love this restaurant. Come check it out. I think you will too."}
{"text":"I came here for the soft open initially; they were having growing pains due to the high demand and we were comped our meal in full. The food was excellent but I decided to give them a few months before coming back in order to allow them to adapt.   I returned this weekend (July 19, 2015) and cannot be happier for the owners. Our dishes came out quickly and the preparation and plating was excellent. Their croque madame had just the right portions of ham and Gruyere. Their cold soup (potato and leek) was refreshing and well balanced. I'm glad I came back and foresee many trips in the future."}
{"text":"We came in for breakfast. Everything we ordered was perfectly delicious. Service was excellent. Will be returning many more times."}
{"text":"I had the breakfast tacos and my niece had kids pancakes.  Both were awesome! We will definitely put this as one of our regular stops."}
{"text":"I have eaten here only twice, but the Quiche is fantastic.  So is the pecan bar.  They use only the freshest ingredients.  The wait staff are friendly and helpful in explaining the menu, but the best part is the owners.  They are genuine good people that are bringing the best food they can to the table.  Give the quiche a try.  You wont be sorry."}
{"text":"Awesome Cafe!!! Over the top customer service and food was amazing. I ordered a mocha with their chocolate pancakes. And my friend ordered some fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and french toast. Both were so good and drinks perfect. I highly recommend for breakfast/brunch!!!"}
{"text":"You order at the counter, they give you a number, then they bring your food. Easy as that! We had no trouble with seating and the food was prompt. Croque madame was delicious and so was the breakfast wrap!! I want to try the avocado toast next time, which looked delicious."}
{"text":"Fast casual breakfast & lunch joint with fresh decor and friendly service. Honestly surprised at the food options and quality. I had blueberry pancakes and tried the french toast - both were delicious and packed with flavor. Very impressed by this little cafe and think you will be, too!"}
{"text":"As Fà-me was being built, I was curious to know what type of food the neat and inviting looking space would serve. Several months after passing by daily, my boyfriend suggested we try it out. I am so glad we did!   During my first visit, my sweetheart and enjoyed a delicious breakfast and he had cold brew coffee while I had fresh squeezed juice. Knowing the food and drink is locally sourced and prepared fresh daily was icing on the cake and made me yearn to go back and try a different menu item.   On my next visit, my roommate had what she said was the best chorizo, egg and potato wrap. It looked delicious and, while I would have loved to have the same, I don't eat pork. The one and only downfall of this place, that I can see, is the lack of meat offerings. If I remember correctly, the only meat choices are sausage, chorizo or bacon.   One of the most special moments of my most recent visit was the extremely wonderful interaction with the owner Maria. She was an absolute delight and you can tell she truly cares about her business and the patrons. Not to mention, she is a dog lover! Hence the reason dog bowls and biscuits are available for our pup friends, who are welcome to enjoy the open front patio.  This is an incredible place and wonderful opportunity to support an up and coming local business. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Great food & coffee. Can't go wrong with anything on their b'fast menu. Excellent lattes."}
{"text":"I love this place! I stop here occasionally on my way between jobs for the atmosphere and the delicious espresso (no cream or sugar needed). Friendly staff and great food are also a plus. Wish I lived closer so I could frequent this place more often."}
{"text":"Fast casual style dining! Beautifully decorated restaurant with food that is fresh and delicious. I had a vanilla latte and a veggie omelet that had goat cheese, cauliflower, broccoli and mushrooms and it came with two sides, I picked the bacon and potatoes. My boyfriend had the breakfast wrap filled with eggs, chorizo, potatoes and cheddar cheese. Everything was AMAZING. Fresh ingredients, well prepared and visually stimulating food. The only thing I wish was that it was closer to home, regardless, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Fame was a great find on our visit from Seattle. After our disappointing hotel c-breakfast, we were eager to be surprised.  We ordered lattes, regular, which was Java rich in flavor, and Chai, just right not over-flavored.  Our breakfasts were also excellent, Huevo Rancheros, with rich flavors, quiche, with perfect crust, and pancakes, that were fluffy.  We can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Came here for some breakfast and it did not disappoint,. I had the wrap is a burrito with cheddar and potatoes I added avacado.  It did not disappoint!  So good the flour tortilla was crispy and toasted.  Would recommend 5$mimosas on point."}
{"text":"First time there under the recommendation of fellow yelpers. The grilled cheese was wonderful--love the fried cheese parts. Lots of flavor. The pineapple mint limeade and chia limeade were also very refreshing on the hot summer day. Ambience is urban modern. Roomy area for self-seating and very chill atmosphere.  Service was great and knowledgeable about menu selections.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Such a gem in the neighborhood. We Found this place via Yelp and it was such a great find! Love the juice and breakfast options! If I lived in Phoenix, I would come here often. The ambience was nice and clean."}
{"text":"Best banana pancakes in downtown Phoenix. I loved their fresh squeezed oj. Super friendly and their coffee is amazing too."}
{"text":"Dinner at Fame last Saturday was the first evening they were open for dinner.  It was a magical experience beginning with exceptionally tasty ceviche and fried cauliflower, followed by grass fed steak and fresh halibut cooked to perfection, accompanied by Pinot Noir and Malbec wines that were perfect pairings, then concluding with a generous cheese and very select cold cut board.  The service was impeccable and the nighttime ambience was greatly enhanced by the charming proprietors, Maria and Ivan."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot!  I had the brioche French toast - just the right crispness, good cinnamon and vanilla flavor, and fresh fruit.  My daughter had the hollandaise sammy special with avocado, which had a good, light sauce and very tasty prosciutto.  My daughter would have liked the avocado to be a little softer, but she still enjoyed it and are most of it.  Will definitely come here again when I'm back for my next college-aged daughter fix."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Perfect to come solo or with group. Food is so fresh, healthy and filling. I ordered the fresh veggie omelet. The ingredients are fresh and flavorful. Definitely order it again.  I'll be back to try more. Sausage was amazing too."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, we had high hopes. Unfortunately, Saturday morning we left very disappointed. Hubby had the Huevos Rancheros and it actually looked pretty scary. (sorry no pic) The black beans looked like they had been pureed. Everything on his plate looked spilled out and awful. No potatoes with it either or meat. I ordered the Dos which I'm pretty sure was supposed to come with potatoes but I guess not. My eggs were ok, pretty bland. The toast was super hard, the crust actually hurt the roof of my mouth. The jam for my super hard toast was strange. Honestly my first thought was \"why did they give me bbq sauce?\".  I ordered a separate side of bacon. The bacon was pretty good. Needless to say, we both left pretty hungry. Oh and they don't have regular tea, only flavored tea which I'm not a fan of. And the girl that took our order looked like she would have rather been at home sleeping and seemed a little annoyed when I asked if they had plain iced tea.  Watching the cops arrest a homeless guy across the street was pretty entertaining. And also the crazy guy talking to himself walk down the street was fun as well. Gotta love what the lightrail brings around.  Now, the good... the decor was great. I loved the planter boxes out front. The light fixtures were great. The tables were nice. And I especially loved the big railroad wood with the lighting wrapped around it. BUT, I don't go somewhere to eat just because it looks nice on the inside. Long story short, we wont' return. :/"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and had an egg sandwich with avocado. I thought the food was overpriced and it was very bland. The only dish that everyone liked was the Chorizo wrap."}
{"text":"I was sorely disappointed by this place. I ordered a coffee and the croque monsieur. The coffee was nothing special and the sandwich was cold and dry. The cheese wasn't even melted past the first top layer and the bechamel sauce was non-existent. When I politely suggested that they made a mistake with my sandwich I was simply told that that is how they do it and there was nothing wrong. Perhaps other menu items are fine but I'll never find out because that was the worst coque monsieur I have ever had and they did nothing to make it right."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular here, despite it being 20 minutes away from me. They have perfected the breakfast burrito. The atmosphere is spot on. The coffee is refillable. It's one of my favorite breakfast places. The only reason I stopped going regularly is because I found a new place closer to my house."}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled upon Fáme Caffe while driving down Central and decided to stop in for breakfast.   I loved the look and decor of the restaurant. The outside seating area where we sat is lined with herb planters which separate you from the parking lot. It is counter service so I'm glad it wasn't extremely busy when we were there.   Everything on the menu sounded pretty great and I finally decided on the Parisian omelette which came with a side of fruit (served in a mini mason jar!) and bread. I noticed the pomegranate sangria and it looked amazing but I opted for a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice, also served in a mason jar! The OJ was fresh and delicious! The omelette was good but a little dry. The portion I thought was a great size, not small but also not over the top big.   Overall I probably wouldn't go back for the omelette but perhaps if I'm in the area I'll stop in and try the sangria."}
{"text":"So far the best place for breakfast I have found. Healthy choices and great drinks. I had the latte, and again delicious. I also was able to bring my doggie."}
{"text":"Beware - parking can be a struggle on a Sunday morning. I got here around 10:30am the other weekend and while I was fortunate to park right in front of the restaurant, others were not so lucky. So I think I arrived at prime brunching time because the line was literally out the door, yet it moved significantly fast. While I waited I was given a number to remember and a gentlemen asked where I would like to sit, to save me a spot with the numbered placeholder. Great idea. Since I was on my own I was able to snag an outside table, which I 100% recommend if you can while the weather is still fantastic. My grapefruit mimosa was perfect, the horchata latte was such a treat to sip on the drive home, and I really enjoyed the madame croquette and side salad. Next time I would probably ask to go easy on all the ham. The best, and most memorable, moment of me eating there was the actual owner of the restaurant came up and asked about the food. She then cleared my plates and asked about my day and if she could do anything else for me. I cannot remember the last time I'd had such an amazing experience. This place is a booming success and I can't wait to be back with friends. It is worth the drive, the wait, and the price!"}
{"text":"Walking distance to this gem!  When moving to the 'hood I fantasized of mornings off work- walking to this little cafe and sitting in the sunshine reading a book with a latte.  My fantasy has become reality and I've been fortunate enough to frequent this cafe a handful of times.  The coffee bar is lovely and the barista is a doll!  I've tried the banana pancakes, and the breakfast sandwich with avocado once and once with bacon.  The pancakes are bomb and I recommend the avocado.  They undercook their bacon so it's one chewy greasy gross mess.  Next time I will get something else or request it crispy. They use brioche for the bread of the sandwich- yum!  They always have fresh flowers and the patio is dog friendly with a bike rack!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service!  Just ate breakfast here with my husband and we loved it.  We were surprised that it wasn't overly busy for a Saturday morning.  What we ordered:  -orange juice (fresh squeezed) -croque madame -French toast -sausage    All were top notch and delicious!  The bread and vanilla citrus custard quality really shine in the French toast.  The croque Madame balanced the tasty flavors of the gruyere cheese, egg and ham.  Yum yum yum!  The service was great too.  This isn't a formal sit down and a server takes your order set up, but believe me they absolutely care that you have a great experience.  The owner came by and gently asked how our food was and what else we might need.  She was truly concerned that we enjoyed our meal and experience.    Finally - for those who visit, read the note by the tip jar.  It's cute and represents what this place is all about :)"}
{"text":"This place is busy for weekends brunch, and for a good reason! The place is super cute and the food was awesome.   They have a fun selection of drinks, many different lemonade types....didn't get to try one but I will be back to. Their coffee though, was amazing!!  Now for the good stuff...the food was not only beautiful but tastey!!! My boyfriend had the monte Cristo and the jam that came with it was the perfect balance. I originally did not like my 1st item, but they corrected the issue and got me the parfait and the French toast and wow was it SOOO good.   Can't say enough about the service here. The chef came out to talk with us. Would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Surprised by the best cup of coffee I've ever had, Italian macchiato. It was so good we went back for a breakfast sandwich the next day. Yum! Toasted fresh bun, slice of green tomato, crisp bacon, topped with a flluffy scrambled egg.  Love the atmosphere in here. Just wish it opened earlier."}
{"text":"Great new joint!! Vibrant restaurant with incredibly fresh and tasty food! We're lucky to live within a 5 minute walk from here!"}
{"text":"Tried this place while my cousin was in town from NY. We both got the avocado toast with egg and it was so delicious. Full of avocado and flavor... not just a couple of pieces. Love that they have a pet friendly patio too. Look forward to going back. Hopefully I'll try something new but the avocado toast was so good I'll probably get that again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, I have also had breakfast items on the menu that are tasty, but don't waste your money on the burger, doesn't taste good, although it may be grass fed beef it tastes like an old frozen patty."}
{"text":"Ditto on Karla H.'s review. Cool atmosphere and great customer service but... - food (omelette) was bland and uninteresting; bread was dry and rubbery; Denny's better and cheaper. - if you want to order just a latte, you have to stand in the same line that people order  breakfast. That means you wait a ridiculous amount of time in line. - interesting restaurant concept but quality and creativity of food NOT on par with Matt's Big Breakfast or Snooze."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The atmosphere is calming and lovely, and Steph is an amazing cashier & person. She made everyone who walked in smile and she is so sweet! The food is amazing and the portions are perfect."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast sandwich some pancakes for the girls... Great coffee great atmosphere congratulations, this place is right on!"}
{"text":"cold food :/ and tried almost everything.  hey guys cold eggs is not the business!!   ...but great staff."}
{"text":"Loved it . Service was a bit slow But the Charm and attitude the staff is outstanding  Food is excellent fresh and many local suppliers I loved my omelette and the latte I will make this a regular stop Its so great when a new place gets it right !"}
{"text":"Inside has an old farmhouse feel with egg cartons used as decor on the ceiling. This is one of those restaurants where you order at the counter and they bring your food to you if you're eating there. They didn't seem to have paper menus that you can look at if you're new to the place, so my husband and I stood in line looking at the back board menu and had to choose quickly, which was fine.   He ordered a breakfast burrito which had chorizo, eggs and potatoes in it and I ordered what was called 'dos',--two eggs served with potatoes. I added chorizo to my eggs. We were both impressed by how good the chorizo was and added their house made sauce to our meals. Their house made sauce tasted like a smoky, spicier Cholula (which we liked!). Coffee is self serving, as well as water, at a table located in the corner of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for dinner the other day. I had the avocado tacos since I'm a vegetarian and they were average. my friends had the agua chile scallops and nopal tacos. they said the agua chile scallops were the best part of their meal. I hope the dinner menu evolves a bit by including a side of rice or beans when you get more than one taco. I guess I just expected more since I had one drink and two meatless tacos that came out to about $24."}
{"text":"When I saw this place being built a few months ago, I couldn't wait to get my behind inside! I finally had the chance to stop by for a quick macchiato and scone. Wow! I was super impressed with my simple meal. The staff was incredibly helpful and sweet. The decor is beautiful, bright, and rustic. In fact, I just returned from a month long trip in Mexico City where I ate at some of the best cafes. I was a little sad to leave them behind knowing I would not find such places on every corner of Phoenix. I found the essence of some of those cafes in Fame Caffe, so thank you! The black and white back splash behind the counter was super tasteful, and added an art-deco element of design again the modern, rustic decor (similar to what I saw abroad).   Back to the food though...  I bought a scone because I thought, why not? I'm here for coffee, yada yada yada. The moment I bit into the cranberry scone, I knew I had to come back for more. It was fresh, flavorful, and hands down muy rico! The espresso was absolutely delightful, and presented exactly how I would order it from the cafes in Mexico City.   Coming here was just what I needed as I was coming off my post-vacation blues. Great service, quality food, and damn good espresso. I'm coming back for brunch, and I'm a woman of habit so you will probably see me often."}
{"text":"This place is average at best. Wife and I got the french toast, Parisian omelet, chai latte, watermelon/melon/pineapple juice. Total was around $30. The french toast was dry and chewy and overly sweet. The omelet was over buttered and otherwise flavorless. The chai was extremely sweet and the juice tasted only like watermelon without the other fruit juices. Worst part of the experience was that I left hungry. Disappointing culinary experience."}
{"text":"Loved this place, but walked into there today and my daughter's ordered a kids meal then gal rudely asked are they under 12! I don't mind paying a little more so they can get it. She said there other stuff on the menu you can get but they can't get a kids meal. You just lost my business as of today."}
{"text":"This place is so beautiful and super clean! They have an outside eating and offer a really good menu! The pastries I recommend they are to die for!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The food and service are exceptional!  There is not one item I would not recommend on the menu! Live the ambiance and friendly people! Go there!"}
{"text":"What a nice place for breakfast.  I don't eat meat, so their lunch menu doesn't offer much for me, but the coffee was great and breakfast was tasty and well presented.  The staff is super nice and the atmosphere was very inviting.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Smallest Açai bowl I have ever seen for $9. I took 2 bites and it was gone. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I recently moved to a brand-new infill apartment complex, Elevation on Central, and when I discovered this amazing restaurant right across the street I decided that I've died and gone to heaven!! There is nothing I love better than quiche and salad for lunch and theirs is fabulous, with fluffy quiche and a wonderful, fresh salad. The French toast is amazing, and my husband loved his omelet so much that he ate every bite, saying that it was the best omelet he's ever eaten. While a previous reviewer described the omelet as \"surprisingly small given the price,\" we thought it was a perfect size for healthy eating. We love the atmosphere, the outdoor dog-friendly patio and the friendly, knowledgeable staff. What a gem!"}
{"text":"Our first visit here, was amazing loved it!   Today was my second visit, and I brought more family with me this time. Wanted them to try something new.   Ordered two chilaquiles, set of pancakes, and Eggs Benny (chefs special).   My cousin did not like the Eggs Benny I went told the cashier that they were not to par. Was not offered a refund only option was an additional item.   I requested a refund, solved no problem.   Go back to finish our meal, my aunt was sharing her chilaquiles with my little cousin, and she pulls this long piece of hair from her mouth. With instant disgust, we gathered our items and left.   I am extremely disappointed, and a bit embarrassed as I raved about this place heavily to all my family and friends."}
{"text":"I got the avocado toast and I can't stop thinking about it. I'm gonna go back one day and get another avocado toast."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast diner!  Loved the Ambiance.  Got something in a skillet (Chiqualetta?) with over easy eggs on top.  Extremely delicious.  Can be a bit crowded, but overall I am thrilled to have found this place."}
{"text":"I love Fame!! We live close, and from our house to sitting down with food in front of us is about 15 minutes - which is a huge deal for a breakfast/brunch that can take SO LONG on a Sunday morning. I get the Veggie Scramble that has this amazing goat cheese in it, and a big iced tea. I've also enjoyed the Madame Croquet as well as their lunch menu sandwiches. My boyfriend always gets their dirty chai which is amazing, way better than a lot of coffee shops with so much cinnamon and spice!!"}
{"text":"Great service, SUPER dog friendly, very clean, and really good food. Very relaxed ambiance."}
{"text":"Anthony Bourdin said it best \"what nicer thing can you do for somebody than make them breakfast\". Fame makes it all as if your visiting a close friend with love and care. Comforting sustenance that leaves you wanting to return. A few favorites are the Fame Omelette and the latin pallet the Chilaquiles. If your looking to quench your thirst try the freshly squeezed juices or a mimosa. Just love this place. Word of caution its gaining popularity so it does get packed at times."}
{"text":"An instant nope. My girlfriend and I came here on a Sunday morning because our first choice restaurant was too crowded. We waited roughly 30 minutes to order our food but were able to find a seat despite how busy they were. Both of our orders came out super greasy due to having so much cheese. The monte cristo can be expected to be on the greasy side due to it being a French toast sandwich, but there was so much cheese that was melted off of the sandwich that it felt like I dipped my hand in a deep fryer. Our bodies were hardly able to digest them. I'm giving 2 stars because the decor is really nice and the self serve coffee allows you to avoid waiting for someone to come around and fill your cup."}
{"text":"Been here twice and they've gotten my order wrong everytime. They recently switched their menu and they literally have an option of 3 eggs and cheese omelette for $8.00. So basically eggs and cheese and if you want additional ingredients it's $1.00 extra and then hopefully they remember to include them. Oh and if you want it to go please plan to wait at least 20 minutes for your food."}
{"text":"Came here while visiting family.  Tried one of the omelettes which was delicious but the best thing here was their coffee.  Their iced americano was delicious as was their cold brew iced coffee.  Price for coffee was very reasonable as well.  Their burgers also look delicious but didn't get to try as I saw someone who ordered it.  Next time I am around the area I would like to try.  If I lived nearby I'd come here everyday for coffee."}
{"text":"A good breakfast wrap, the potatoes we mashed and almost had a grit like texture, which was good along with the sausage instead of chorizo for me.    The orange juice was pre squeezed into Mason jars ready for serving.  A little on the sour side, but still fresh none the less."}
{"text":"2nd go round... Near perfect both times. Service is stellar and the food is top notch. I've had both the Parisian omelette and the Croque Madame, each were tasty in their own way. The kitchen staff knows proper execution of a perfect omelette, however the Croque really impressed. This new Central ave joint deserves your patronage."}
{"text":"It is a quiet winter morning on a weekend in the desert. The sun outside unfolds through hints of cloud and crisp, refreshing air. Before me rests a mug, two books, a pen. Lifting my eyes, a window opens out to frame the waking human world with all its anxious human pulse.  Service here is slow, but not unkind. I blame it on the numbers in this spacious public house - we the crowd of hungry/thirsty travelers, we the sound of words and thoughts that fill it to the rafters. Twisting my neck I see that nearly every seat is filled.  Before too long a plate of food arrives and perches just beside me to the left. On it rests an omelet, a clutch of moist potatoes, and reclining halves of toast. A thin film of steam arises from the egg as from my mug. Breathing through the nose, I almost taste it.  Visitors shift past me as I slowly raise a bite. A body ruffles edges of the jacket on my back in apologetic passing. The omelet neatly cut now offers view of steaming contents: wet strings of melted cheese, warm squares of tomato, folded egg, and pebbled scallions.  The first bite to the last is wrapped in silence, slow breathing, an unpredicted hum of satisfaction. Alternating samples of the toast prove omelet's equal. Another sip of coffee. A stranger exits, smiling. Soon the plate is empty but for scraps.  BACKGROUND  Fàme Caffe has been calling to me for well over a year now. Sadly, our schedules have refused to sync up until today. I entered Fàme with more than a years' worth of pent up anticipation, and left without the meagerest complaint.  Everything from atmosphere to service to the food was registered a win. In passing, the Caffe seems small and unassuming. Upon entrance, one can't help but be impressed by use of space. Tall ceilings, plentiful seating, and a healthy hum of activity draws you in.  The menu is surprisingly extensive with primarily health-conscious options. The food does not disappoint. Somewhat restricted hours equal longer lines and greater congestion than other options, but the experience of this place is distinctly worth the wait.  Fàme inspires a sense of community and of awareness. Come prepared to stay a little while. Come prepared to eat healthy for a fair price. But do come. You won't be disappointed. I know I'll be back - my spirit and my taste buds have assured me.  ;)  IMPORTANT NOTE  I have confirmed that Fàme is, in fact, pronounced Fah-May. This was a source of some confusion for me up until this morning.  CONCLUSION  Don't miss this hidden gem. Check the hours, work out the scheduling of it, then come by for some really great eats and an inspiring ambiance. The team will likely be busy attending to guests, but they'll be sure to make you feel at home.  Fàme Caffe Crew: thank you for the hard work you put in every day. Thank you for the outstanding food and wonderful service, and for creating such a beautiful space and spirit. It's noticed, and it's appreciated. I hope to see you all again very very soon.  :)"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and steel cut oatmeal. Plenty of places to sit and friendly staff. This place will definitely replace my Lux addiction."}
{"text":"Really good food, really good service! Healthy options, pastries, coffee, and delicious tea. The interior is adorable, and is worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Very cool place. Nice vibe in the heart of Phoenix. Really nice people working and also the patrons Good caffe and Croque Monsieur."}
{"text":"Glad this place opened up a few months ago.  Great place to go for breakfast, brunch, or lunch with a nice ambiance.  My usual is the breakfast, eggs, toast, sausage, coffee, etc.  They have a daily homemade jam for the toast.  The vanilla cantaloupe preserves are my favorite so far.  Pet friendly patio, outside seating when it isn't too hot, convenient to the light rail.  Really glad I have a place like this near where I live.  I'm a regular now.  The lunch chicken pesto sandwich is really good as well.  Fast and friendly service is a plus."}
{"text":"My best friend and I went to Fàme around 2:30 on a Sunday after attempting to eat at another restaurant that unbeknownst to closed at 2:00. We didn't know what to expect because we only had about 5 minutes to look at the Yelp reviews in between restaurants. Boy were we fortunate that the other restaurant was closed! The food and the service at Fàme was exceptional! The atmosphere was trendy and pleasant and the location was convenient. My friend ordered the breakfast wrap, I ordered the Croque Monsieur with a side of potatoes and we split an order of pancakes that came with a side of fresh fruit. Each dish was delicious and it's obvious that they use the freshest ingredients available. The pancakes were light and flavorful and I swear they have someone in the back churning butter! It was that good!!! The owner stopped by our table to check on us. She has to be the sweetest lady alive! She was genuinely concerned about our happiness & confirmed their use of fresh and organic local products. Fàme is a new favorite of mine. I can't wait to go back and try something new!!! Oh yeah...the cappuccino I had was delicious too!!!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmm! I came here with my friend and got mochas, the chilauqiles and the breakfast tacos. The food was beyond amazing!!! Really cool restaurant, great outside seating and indoor/outdoor bar seating. Love!"}
{"text":"This place is so damn cute! So happy it just opened right down the street from us on central just south of camelback. We got the two egg breakfast that comes with toast, potatoes, and bacon. As well as a fresh squeezed green morning juice made with apple, carrot, cucumber, grape, spinach, kale, and parsley! All the ingredients here are from local farms! The decor is adorable and hip and the atmosphere is light and comfortable and happy. They have brunch, lunch, fresh juices, a coffee bar, and baked goods. Perfect for a Saturday morning!"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers for the lead to Fame, pronounced fa, like \"so la ti do fa\" and me, like may. You stand in line to order, the assign a table number while you wait, you order, they bring it to you. Every one is friendly, casual place. I ordered avocado toast with a poached egg and Hubs ordered  Fame omelet with 3 eggs, aged cheddar. Everything was fresh, delicious and just the right amount. Not those massive quantities at diners. Potatoes had perfect salt-rosemary ratio. Wishing this place had a location in my hometown."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast today and can say this was hands down the best breakfast I've had in Arizona. Service was fantastic, and the owners are there EVERYDAY! I got the cheddar omelette, but with scrambled eggs instead of omelette style and the eggs were perfectly cooked and the veggies were fresh and really tasty. The house potatoes and bacon were also soooo delicious and the butter pancakes were by far some of the best I've ever had. Coffee is amazing, the \"easy going\" pressed juice was delicious. Will be returning quite frequently. Definitely a new favorite."}
{"text":"This was my second time at Fame .  The first was to sample the cold brew and sublime  baked goods.  They did NOT disappoint!  I went again yesterday to meet up with dear friends who are moving to Long Beach.  I spied a lot of delicious options but decided on the Croques Madame.  It's a classic French recipe that added the twist of Noble Bread's 7-grain toast as the base.  The nuttiness of the bread, combined quite nicely with the healthy helping of toasted  Gruyere cheese, bechamel sauce, lean ham, and an egg, to create a satisfying brunch entree .  It was the BEST version of this dish I've ever had!  This place is always hopping and the staff is pleasant and efficient.  The seating is comfortable and the patrons are laid back and satisfied.  All of these things combined make for a great experience!  I am definitely putting this on the regular rotation!"}
{"text":"This was a good experience,   Counter service (not a fan of this)  Food was good though! A little pricey for breakfast for the amount of food that we got. In a pinch this place is a good back up place to go."}
{"text":"This was definitely one of our favorite places in Phoenix. We visited the city for the weekend and had time to check out places before Lost Lake. We came here twice! It was that good.  It's a beautifully decorated restaurant where you order up front and find a table to sit at. If it's busy, someone will come up to ask how many people are in your party and they'll get a table for you.  I tried the frenchie toast (highly recommend this), avocado toast with bacon, and Parisian omelet. All were really good, but the French toast was amazing. It's crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. It comes with berries on top and doesn't need too much maple syrup. My next fave was the Parisian omelet - def recommend if you're looking for something light to eat.  Some standouts that my friends ordered: croque madame, oatmeal, breakfast wrap. They said the chorizo was delicious.   Note: their hot sauce has a kick to it!  I honestly wish that I had this place in the Bay Area. It's soooo good!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time this weekend! You order your food at the counter and they give you a number to take to your table.  The French toast had really good flavor, but the bread was a bit tough and hard to cut. My husband was very hungry and asked about the biscuits and gravy portion size. The staff member stated it was a heavy portion, however he received a small portion. We didn't care if it came as a small portion, we just wanted accurate information when placing our order.  I love the decor and atmosphere. Very laid back and would be a great place to hang out while studying."}
{"text":"Bomb.com Finally found a place by my house that is good for breakfast and healthy eating."}
{"text":"Really cool spot with breakfast, lunch, coffee and fresh squeezed juices. Quality is the word as everything is made in house. My go to is the breakfast sandwich and a vanilla latte."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Super rad outdoor set up. Food is 10/10 - pancakes with banana and chocolate chips, veggie scramble, rosemary potatoes. Friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"I loved the space and the decor of this restaurant. I went with my coworkers for lunch and was pleased it had parking, which is a problem in central phoenix. Staff was friendsly. Prices were a little more than I would have liked but you are paying for high quality ingredients.  I had the chicken pesto sandwich with the side salad. The pesto was to die for and the chicken was really fresh and shaved thin."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's definitely my new favorite caffe. I have been here for breakfast, brunch, and lunch. I tried something different every time & have NOT been disappointed. Aside from the food tasting great, the staff is super friendly & helpful. Tje environment is very chill & they play good music. It gets really busy on the weekends for brunch but i think it's totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite cafe in Phoenix! I originally found the cafe in Uber eats as I was dying for chai one day at work. Usually delivery from a cafe isn't the most thrilling, but Fàme did a lovely job. Everything was packaged beautifully and my order was perfect. I finally got to go and really enjoy everything Fàme has to offer recently (normally I just grab and go or order delivery). The patio is lovely and the food is even better when you stay in and eat. I'm looking forward to bringing my fiancé here one weekend soon. Fàme is the  perfect spot for excellent food and diving  into a new book."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place! Fast casual, with quality food, friendly and personable employees. They locally source their ingredients from farms in the area, great! I had the breakfast sandwich, which had delicious heirloom tomatoes on it, and the rosemary potatoes are full of flavor."}
{"text":"Free refills on organic coffee! The space is beautiful: large windows, natural lighting, refurbished wood detailing, old-fashioned light bulbs. There are also yummy samples at the front. I sampled the lemon (?) poppyseed scone, which was delicious, but ordered the tomato basil focaccia bread, also wonderful, as I wanted something savory. If you're looking for a quieter alternative to Lux (a block up the road) with similar quality coffee + food, I would send you here! I'm so excited I discovered this place!"}
{"text":"This place has the dubious honor of being the setting for where my parents met my boyfriend...  And it turned out to be a great setting. My father, who is hard of hearing, requested a quiet place for lunch, and it can be a struggle to find somewhere that doesn't blast \"background\" music. Other reviews seemed to indicate that Fàme Caffe would not be such a place. As promised, the place was adorable, the weather was perfect and made the open storefront an ingenious idea, and the food was excellent. My companions had sandwiches of various sorts, which seemed to hit the spot, and my berry salad was everything I needed. Nicely done, Fàme!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  We went for Sunday mid-day Coffee.   The service was super nice. Our barrista was super nice and made an amazing coffee, that is not served in plastic cup (sorry Starbucks lovers).   The location is superb. Inside is super spacious and outside seating area is just as nice. It is not cluttered.   We only had coffee and some pastries and all of it was delicious. I was craving a lemon bar whole day and they didn't have one but it is kind of hard to top the lemon bars I make so it is better they didn't have any :-)   We are for sure going back to this place and we want check out their food.   Thank you Fame!"}
{"text":"They have great bananas. I had the avocado toast with a side of the house potatoes!! They were so crispy and seasoned!! I love the ambiance of this place too. Dog-friendly patio. The workers were super friendly. Gave me a free pen."}
{"text":"Great environment and exceptional service and mimosas. This open restaurant can be a bit loud as the crowd filters in but get there at opening time and it's quaint and quiet. The bacon and pancakes are amazing!"}
{"text":"It's my first visit. We had huevos rancheros, avocado toast, iced caramel, and a toddy that I didn't like. The server was so nice about it despite being super busy. Amy offered different choices. I decided on white vanilla grapefruit hot tea with honey. Yum. The avocado toast and huevos rancheros were delicious! I will def come back and try something new. The food looks so yummy."}
{"text":"This is hip little spot in the heart of central Phoenix. Definitely an assortment of breakfasty foods and coffee. It was really neat how you could draw and color on the table clothes. Passes the time while waiting for your food to come out. However, I will say make your food choice wisely. I got the breakfast sandwich and my girlfriend got the chorizo breakfast burrito and I instantly realized I made the biggest mistake of my life when they brought our food out. The burrito was massive and super tasty and took both hands to hold. The breakfast sandwich was sub par and only took one to hold and it was a bit on the bland side. Some hot sauce pepped it up a bit though. I would definitely come back, but I would definitely order something else. Oh and the pancakes are massive too and take up an entire plate and so light and fluffy."}
{"text":"The best breakfast I've had in central phoenix.  The mood fantastic.   We went there for the first time on Saturday for coffee and had to come back for breakfast this morning.  My GF asked if they would rewarm her meal which had gone cool, and the owner, Maria, walked out with a hot plate and some banana bread that was killer.  I guessed was from Spain and I was right .   I'll be back many times!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times- each time they have screwed up my order. The girl at the cash register, Kylee, had a terrible sassy attitude and incorrectly entered a simple order for one stack of pancakes.  The food is good but the service and the staff are awful.  If this place would fire their rude staff and hire some people who were remotely friendly then this would be a five star review."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this new place out. The pictures and the reviews were good.  I got here ordered my food and then they give my order to someone else. What's worse is that they did nothing until I said something about it.  The food doesn't even look as good! I should have went to Lux. At least their service is on point!"}
{"text":"Everything I've gotten is delicious! The Croque Madame is delicious. Savory and cheesy. The Burger melts in your mouth. The hand cut fries are good too! They always have fresh teas and limeaide."}
{"text":"Love the food, the atmosphere, the coffee and did I mention the food is awesome!!! Bringing my mom next time!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I am really impressed by this place. My boyfriend and I have certain food allergies and they were very friendly and accommodating about them. Even when the order came out incorrect, my boyfriend and I were very understanding as we know we have a lot food needs. But the chef came out and was very apologetic about it. It was very clear that the chefs here have pride in the food they serve. Besides all that, the food (and the coffee!!) are very delicious!! I highly recommend, not only if you have food allergies, but if you are looking for top notch food and coffee."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!!! Super trendy and hip, I felt right at home. The food was delicious and light enough that I could enjoy a fresh Pastry for desert. The food is well thought out and all made with ingredients from local farms. For a soft opening the service was more than perfect. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I love the French toast and pancakes.  I haven't tried anything else yet, because these things are so good I can't help but order them again and again.  It's a little loud inside when it's crowded and on the weekends there is a long line to order (unless you arrive early).  Some people might consider it a little overpriced, but I'm fine with it."}
{"text":"In the year or so that I've been patronizing this cafe, it has come a long way! They have switch around the physical layout of the place, streamlined their ordering system, and have expanded the menu to incorporate a wider variety of breakfast and lunch options. Most importantly, however, they have kept true to their mission of serving locally sourced, splendidly tasty food! Their breakfast sandwich is sublime (for some reason, their eggs are fluffy, light, and heavenly) and their breakfast wrap (with added avocado) is the perfect way to start the day. Highly recommend getting here before 10am on the weekend though, as it does get very busy!"}
{"text":"My first time here at Fame Caffe. It's a cute little place for breakfast. I had something off the Chef's Specials, I had the Eggs Benny and it's delicious. The atmosphere is pretty cool."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 5 stars because their service is super friendly and the food is absolutely delicious! They also allow pets on their outdoor patio. What I don't like is that they don't have a kids menu so it gets pricey when my stepdaughter and I have breakfast. A place that I frequent often has an amazing a la cart menu so my step daughter can eat off that."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly. Nice atmosphere. Fantastic food. Highly recommend breakfast, brunch, or lunch here."}
{"text":"Quality items that don't break the bank.  I ordered the Croque Madam based off of the recommendations and it really is a delicious breakfast.  I wasn't aware that it was stuffed with meat and cheese; I actually thought it was mostly going to be toast.  Glad I tried it.  I also got the breakfast wrap with chorizo.  Nice spices without being overwhelming, melted cheese, and a soft tortilla that's chewy (not like the thin dry bread wraps).  It comes with blended salsa that you can pour on top.  Easy enough place to find, ice water dispenser, good parking, casual atmosphere.  The total for 2 breakfasts and a drink was about $22.  One thing they might want to change is the ordering process.  There's just one cashier and all orders are placed at front counter right after you walk in.    The ladies before me wanted to sample tea before buying, then when I was up, I had a couple of questions about the menu that slowed things down as well.  The people behind us just had to wait.    Also....my apologies, but I just realized that I didn't leave a tip.  I paid at the counter and planned on leaving a tip on the table, but since the service is just food drop off I just completely forgot by the time I was done.  Anyway, it wasn't because I didn't enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"What a great little breakfast place. Had the chorizo burrito. Was on point. Wish I would have known how huge they were tho. My girlfriend and I could have shared one instead of getting two. Their coffee was great too. Had an iced caramel coffee. Really wish we lived closer to this awesome little joint. I would be there all the time. Good choice."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast location.  I had the caramel frappe and it was delicious.  Very great environment, you can order at the register, within minutes you will have your food!"}
{"text":"I went with a few friends to Fàme the weekend it opened.  I had the yogurt parfait, my boyfriend had a beautiful-looking mushroom and gruyère omelette, and my two friends had pancakes.  The parfait was just what I wanted - natural, unsweetened yogurt with local fruit that could not have tasted fresher.  The homemade granola was nice and crispy, not chewy and stale-textured, and had lots of sweetened almond slivers (yum!). I got the large size ($9), and was stuffed.  The mushrooms in the omelette were firm and plump; it was a nicely balanced piece.  The pancakes were also tasty. The coffee was ok. The ambiance is stylish, warm and welcoming.  Prices seemed a little on the high side, but this seems to be the norm as the quality and attractiveness of great little restaurants keeps improving around here.  The owners and staff are incredibly friendly and accommodating.  Fàme is on my short list of brunch spots!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Lots of organic options, but missing more pastries options and it's quite pricey for a lunch menu, but considering it's quality and organic well it's worth the price. The avocado toast is amazing!"}
{"text":"Fàme Caffe is so cute! It had a very welcoming rustic decor with a nice open dog friendly patio. My husband and I decided to try this new spot out for brunch last weekend. I went with the Farmer salad and my husband chose the french toast along with some Arnold Palmers. The salad was awesome, it had a generous amount of shaved vegetables, creamy feta and a flavorful vinaigrette. I opted for tuna for some extra protein and avocado which were both nice additions. My husband's french toast was a huge portion of thick Noble bread. It was perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. In addition they had real maple syrup to go with it, and some fresh fruit & bacon. The french toast was so delicious, my husband devoured the whole thing, I thoroughly enjoyed the few bites I was able to steal though. The owner came to make sure that we were enjoying our meals, which I thought was a nice touch. My only complaint was that the lemonade in our Arnold Palmers was extremely tart (as in they may have forgot to add the sweetener?) nothing a few packets of sugar couldn't remedy though. I will be adding this one to our brunch/lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I love Fame, beat oatmeal around!  Their quiche is my second favorite, coffee great too!"}
{"text":"I came in here for a quick and healthy bite before a meeting next door! It was exactly what the doctor ordered. Delicious iced tea, one of the best beet salads that i've ever had, wifi, and a wonderful ambiance! I also ordered the potato leek soup and wasn't the biggest fan so I probably wouldn't order that again but I will FOR SURE come back for the beet salad! Their farm-to-table concept is fantastic and seems to be all the rage these days! I highly recommend stopping in here for a healthy breakfast or lunch if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome spot! I've always driven by this place and wondered if it was worth stopping in and it definitely is. The girl at the counter was very helpful and polite and the breakfast burrito that I ordered was very good. I like the ambiance of this place and the location so I'll be coming in quite often."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have had everything from a delicious Bloody Mary and bomb ass breakfast burrito with chorizo to a simple but very good avocado toast and absolutely the very best coffee anywhere! Plus awesome service, sweet music, free Wifi and more! I'm coming back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Nice and simple just the way we like it.    People are unbelievably nice.    I really enjoyed my visit."}
{"text":"I just moved to the neighborhood and discovered there was a new breakfast, lunch / juicebar / coffeeshop open next to Hula's. Probably my favorite new spot for everyday coffee and quick food. I met the owner the other day and she's pretty awesome!  Fivestars on Juice Fivestars on Breakfast and Lunch Fivestars on Coffee"}
{"text":"What can I say, we drive 45 miles just to eat breakfast at fà-me. The food is farm fresh and perfectly prepared! Service is great too! You can't beat this place!"}
{"text":"We were on the hunt for a hipster-y trendy cafe and we found one!  The food was good, and average priced. The coffee was good, too.  The woman serving me was so friendly and sweet and wanted to know all about Canadian coins (I was visiting from Canada) and we had a long talk about it, which I found endearing.  The juice tasted very yummy and it was sweet, the french toast was DELICIOUS. Food comes quick, too.  Cute place."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience. The decor and atmosphere alone, make you feel very welcomed at this place. You walk in and the menu/cashier is located immediately to your right. You have multiple options to choose from and the beverage options are just as great as the food. I chose the Parisian omelette and matcha to drink. You get seated with a number which is how they locate you to deliver your food. My omelette was decadent and flavorful, and my tea was smooth and creamy. Great overall experience, I will definitely return next time I'm In town."}
{"text":"When I go to fàme I always get their breakfast wrap and it never disappoints ! Also, I will get a vanilla latte, extra foam, and they always make it perfectly. Service is exceptional. Definitely a favorite go-to for brunch."}
{"text":"Delicious! Delicioso! Délicieux!  Chalk this one down as a first for me.  A neighborhood cafe serving a mixture of American, Mexican, and French (!!!) breakfast and lunch items.  All the while sourcing everything organically and almost entirely locally.  Yup, i was an intrigued as you are.  So I ventured here on Saturday morning near their 8am opening to see for myself.  Fame occupies what used to be just your average neighborhood coffee house (Java Cafe).  Ivan and Maria O'Farrill have since turned this prime spot on Central & Highland into an indoor/outdoor restaurant and cafe with beautiful wooden accents throughout the entire space.  There's plenty of seating (probably enough for about 100) but the space is still intimate and cozy enough without being too crowded.  Order at the front counter here whether dining in or taking out.  Be warned as the display case with fresh baked pastries will tempt you greatly while you wait in line to give your order.  As this is the first breakfast spot in Central Phoenix where I've found french breakfast items, I went with the Croque Madame this go around.  I also got a small cup of their house made berry parfait.  Total cost including water and tax came to about $17.  I grabbed a seat at one of the stools at the indoor/outdoor bar table that faces north along Central Avenue since the morning weather was ideal.  Food came out in about 5 minutes.  So here's the lowdown on the Croque Madame.  Two slices of toasted multigrain bread (sourced from Noble Bread, a local Phoenix bakery), with ham in the middle (and lots of it), gruyere cheese on top (again, lots of it), a sunny side up egg and a side of fresh greens.  But the secret sauce here (literally) is the the béchamel sauce that drenches this dish.  Basically its a white sauce made from butter, flour, and milk that is used on a variety of french dishes.  Oh my heavens was this awesome.  It almost eats like a ham & cheese sandwich, but much richer.  Almost as if you were dipping cured ham in a cheese fondue.  Its that gooey and rich (and delicious).  For the berry parfait, it was served in what almost looks like a candle jar and included a berry mixture, greek yogurt, honey, granola, and nuts.  Much bigger portion than I would've expected for the \"small\" size.  Made for a nice light and fruity contrast with the richness of the Madame.  Fantastic breakfast and one that shall be repeated again in the not to distant future.  They also have a decent looking lunch menu with a nice array of beer and wine options to boot.  On weekends they have some special brunch items including a short rib enchilada dish that caught my attention.  And the pastry case will likely be impossible for me to say no to going forward.  So yes, Fame is legit and full of promise.  The ambiance and the food are full proof.  Even, apparently, if you're a French expat."}
{"text":"Loved the service! Waiters are friendly and the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place, one of our favorite brunch location. The vibe is always so perfect and the food is always very good. All the staff is very friendly and we have never had a bad experience from the time we been coming to Fame.  You can really tell the chef put love in all the food because it is very delicious. would highly recommend Fame."}
{"text":"Super cute breakfast/brunch spot!  I tried their iced caramel coffee, it was good but wish it was a bit sweeter. Love how it's easy to get in and out(sometimes) for the parking area. They are closed on Mondays. Also you can order food from them to be delivered to you from UberEats."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been to Fame Caffe and I must say, it deserves more stars than I originally wrote. I wanted to have a healthy breakfast for a change, so I ordered the avocado toast (with bacon of course, can't be TOO healthy) and I was pleasantly surprised. It was seasoned well, with a great lemon-y taste. The sesame seeds and the micro cilantro complemented it well. I  would have preferred for the bread to be toasted though.   They are a variety of choices to choose from on the menu, from healthy choices like the veggie scramble to the breakfast wrap which consisted of mexican chorizo (the server recommended this). I ordered a caramel latte. It was good and strong without being too sweet. Fame could get a little pricey - I spent $14 without tip for a small avocado toast and iced coffee.   I absolutely love the ambiance of this restaurant. It is straight out of an HGTV episode; it looked like a place Chip and Joanna Gaines built, with the farmhouse/modern feel. Up on the ceiling are egg crates which gives the place some charm. I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Pros: The avocado toast with chili/chili oil is crack. I was super wary on the flavor profiles, but now I'm sold. Plus it cannot be beat for $6. It's also one of the few places that serve real maple syrup by default. The bacon is also crack - must be slightly candied. It's a super comfortable place to have breakfast/lunch or a meeting for freelancers (there were a TON of people on their computers). Cons: Ok. The service sucks. I think they mean well, but they don't think. I came in with my baby and all my hands full when they handed me a drink, my credit card back, a giant block number for my order then told me yes - you can get water yourself over there and the high chairs are there too. Really?? And this was at 2pm. It was not busy at all. It left me rather irritated. I get that this doesn't really define totally crappy service, but it sure separates you from amazing service."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. I wish every breakfast place had the quality that goes into fa'me. Seriously was at a loss for words. I drove out of my way for this place. It's a very fast paced spot. You have to find your own table which I don't truly care for but it totally matches the vibe of this restaurant. I had the Parisian omelet. Small and light but so so good. Everything that walked by looked unreal. I already know that I'm going to order something new every time until I finish the entire menu. Restaurants like this always are a great find because you can change it up while always enjoying what you're eating. Hands down my favorite breakfast spot. Must must must go!!!!"}
{"text":"Great new addition to the Uptown neighborhood.  We stopped in for brunch shortly after it opened and snagged a great outdoor table to enjoy with our dog.  I had an egg white omelet and really enjoyed my breakfast.  The restaurant has a rustic, comfortable feel to it.   You order at the counter and the staff delivers the food to your table.  They have a great looking pastry case and a full coffee bar.  Great laid back place to grab something to drink, read a book and enjoy the scenery."}
{"text":"First off, don't get the chocolate croissant!  It was burnt, dense and so stiff!  It may have killed chocolate croissants for me it was so bad!  Otherwise, the coffee was solid.  The Croque Madame was delightful, and pretty much everything comes with a bit of side salad which at times are random (my friend got some with biscuits and gravy.  Whaa?).  The portions are a bit on the small side for the pricing but hey, it's a hip joint, man.    I gotta say, even if I didn't get a brownie - those are the lamest brownies I've ever seen!  It's like they took a good size brownie and cut it into 3 layers.  Each layer is like 4 bucks!  They need to fix that baked goods area, no doubt."}
{"text":"After spin class, friend Monica and I were driving along minding our business when she noticed the mural of the chicken on their front wall. Because of that, we stopped in for coffee. Place is very clean and service was great. Coffee was pretty tasty! Monica did have breakfast. I don't believe I ever saw her take a bite so I guess she enjoyed it. I'd love to return to try their breakfast or lunch menu. Cheers*** :)"}
{"text":"Just stopped in to Fame as we noticed it was open finally. Had a lovely brunch that runs until 3 p.m... tested the French toast created from Noble Country bread and the hubster had the oatmeal which could easily have fed an army.  French toast was crunchy in a way that only Noble bread could create with delicious under notes of vanilla.   The hearty oatmeal had to have been cooking on the stove all morning to create such wonderful meaty rolled oats  with carmelized bananas slices throughout.   the Juice Meister was kind enough to create a special Sweet Tooth version of healthy juices just for me. I know I need the vitamins but don't want to know they're there and he achieved that in a wonderful mixture.    Clean, hip vibe and the friendliest service and most competent service I have ever experienced during a soft opening. Next week comes the hard opening and I wish them well... they deserve it"}
{"text":"Hubby, baby and I stopped by for an unplanned bfast this morning and stopped by here due to the yelp reviews,   The cafe is very cute, clean and the decor is pleasant. There are lots of plants, herbs and spices. Some of the decor was very cleaver, like the egg crates arranged on the ceiling like art.   I hesitated on whether to give this place a 3 or 4... I'd say a 4 on ambiance and location a 3 on service and food. At this price point, you'd expect something other than counter service. Breakfast with coffee is about $15 per person give or take. The food was just ok. I had the Parisian and it was $11 (coffee another 4-5). It's an egg white omelette with gruyere, mushrooms, caramelized onion and spinach. It's obvious they use butter, which is great, however my omelette was VERY greasy, not what you expect with egg whites ( luckily I LOVE butter or I would have sent this back). The onions were also not caramelized, they could have been cooked longer. The bread served with breakfast was the great! Crusty and fresh, I kind of wanted to buy a loaf. My daughter ate the fruit and she have them two baby thumbs up! My hubs had the bfast sandwich and was not impressed. NOT that it was bad, just nothing special, nothing stood out. The coffee is self serve and was ok. I've had better coffee at Merci and other bfast locations with similar set-ups.   I think this place may be worth it if I'm in the area, but if we are planning ahead, we would likely pick somewhere else."}
{"text":"Decent. Not spectacular but a good place to grab a bite to eat.  Did not try coffee but rather the blood orange mimosas....which were of course good.  Had the breakfast tacos.  The mashed potatoes dominated them and it was hard to taste anything else...the main reason for the low review.    Huevos Ranchero was not as expected/described.  Was served in a skillet with all sides dumped in and just not a well thought out dish.    We tried this spot on a whim.  Most likely will not come back....but if your in the area give it a try.  Seems to be very popular."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast! Loved the Monte Cristo with an egg added, French toast, cornbread and coffee. Cute place and great service. Order at counter and they bring it to you. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Its Ok,,, we had Omelets to go ,, Not sure i liked them.. They had everything falling out of them . I asked for cheese in them and I could barely find it.. I will admit the Bacon was Great.. Ill give it another try."}
{"text":"I've  loved both visits here.. My son lives right  across the street so when we are in town, we have to stop.. The breakfast wrap and avocado toast are both winners.. Along with house potatoes.. On our last visit, we sat at the counter and ordered there.. The server/bartender was not very attentive, but the food and ambience make up for that! We'll  be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite brunch place from now on! This place is truly local, meaning you will meet the owners here. Ivan from Mexico and María from Spain. The food is delicious and you can tell its made with the main ingredient, love. I got a turkey sandwich, simple and yet delicious. My wife got huevos rancheros. She said, better than Chelsie's Kitchen. A creature of habit, so it's a big complement. We chatted with both owners at the bar, met another couple that comes here \"every Sunday.\" So a truly neighborhood feel. Oh, and the food came out super fast, not that we were in a hurry. We lingered for a while just because it was cool chatting with the owners, trying an artisanal Mexican beer and learning that they plan to open for dinner soon. Maybe tapas or paella? Can't wait to find out!"}
{"text":"Amazing food great service! Delicious coffee! Cool atmosphere.  Get the blueberry pancakes!! Juevos rancheros and avocado toast are also delicious!"}
{"text":"i love this spot...esp for breakfast.  reasonable prices and the food is amazing! my BH ordered the fame omelette with fresh fruit and noble bread. also fresh squeezed oj, which he said was fantastic. the omelette was generously stuffed with gruyere (sub'd for cheddar) and was perfectly cooked.  coffee could have been stronger, but he likes a bold bean. :) i had the pancakes with blueberries,'which were the best i've had anywhere. and i love pancakes. absolutely nothing on them and they were the. best. ever. my iced tea was subtly flavored and delicious.  service was terrific and the line in which you place your order moved well. the space has a great vibe and is really clean and fun.  a must go!"}
{"text":"Large menu with fresh ingredients, indoor and outdoor seating with delicious coffee offerings as well as bar selections. The omelet was delicious and the mimosa was generous."}
{"text":"Food was average. Service was ok. The food came out cold for both means my guest. I am not a fan of cold eggs, toast or potatoes. There was no butter or jam given to us for the toast. When we asked for it the jam brought out was tart and not sweet. The food wasn't horrible but it also wasn't great. Would I go back, no."}
{"text":"Avocado toast was yummy. Minus one star for the tough chorizo (had difficulty slicing it) and minus another star for the watery latte.   On a Saturday morning, the environment is for brunch conversation, not for a plop down with your laptop and work... will have to try something else on their menu and see if their coffee is really mediocre."}
{"text":"Absolutely this place. Just moved to Central Phoenix and been wanting to try it. Lots of yummy options so much that I just want to come back and try it all. Enjoyed the avocado toast with scrambled eggs on it and an iced vanilla latte. Sooo good. I was shocked it wasn't packed. Highly recommend this spot..a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Started eating hear about a month ago and it's been great every time.  I was just there this morning after an appointment and it's a great place to enjoy a good cup of coffee, some delicious food and decent people watching.   Everyone is always very friendly and helpful.  Food wait times are minimal and the food is delicious.  I haven't had any of the meat items so I can't vouch for that, but everything non-meat having has been superb. Enjoy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast. Excellent service, quality food, modern atmosphere. A bit noisy, but most importantly food."}
{"text":"Just love love it here! I know I've ordered the same thing each time I've come to the avocado on wheat toast. It's just so delicious and refreshing. They have a big selection of tea's hot and cold. A big variety in the menu."}
{"text":"Yummy! Went here for breakfast and was not disappointed. Went with croque madame on the cashier's recommendation and was not disappointed. Had a yummy and hearty breakfast with a latte. The cafe is cute with adorable decor and cool farmhouse tables. The bathroom was clean and the service was good. I definitely will be back, but only when I feel like splurging. It was on the pricier side."}
{"text":"I was just across the street for a HS graduation and decided to pop by for some nom noms. As soon as I walked in, it was a familiar feeling of, the currently trendy style, hipster health food food grub joint.  Wood walls with stainless steel tables garnished with a tin bucket with eating utensils and napkins and a small base with pastel colored plants. It is always nice to dine in such a relaxing environment. There is indoor and outdoor seating, so you can choose either or.  The food was overall \"just good.\" I had the chicken pesto sandwich but the chicken was quite dry and I don't feel that the pesto was all that particularly great. But... You can get a side of salad or Fries and I got the fries. The fries were a hearty amount and definitely filled me up. Again, the fries were just the same 'ol same 'ol fries, nothing special."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The food is outstanding and the service is fabulous. The kitchen uses local produce which is always a selling point for me. The establishment itself is well designed & intriguing (Egg crates on the ceiling, now that's repurposing at its finest!). I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I love this place but I wish they would open on time in the mornings. This could become a busy morning stop for those of us driving by on the way to work BUT opening time and readiness is unreliable. They need to be 100% ready and open at 7 am sharp if they want the morning \"on the way to work\" crowd."}
{"text":"Really nice brunch spot downtown! They have a good amount of vegetarian and omnivore options. A few vegan items too. Service was quick and friendly for being a busy Sunday. Everything on the menu looked good so it was hard to make a decision! I ordered the breakfast sandwich sub avocado instead of bacon, and it was very good! Definitely didn't skimp on the avocado!  My husband ordered the breakfast wrap, which was also quite tasty. Overall,  affordable, cool spot for breakfast/brunch downtown!"}
{"text":"Such a lovely spot for a quick breakfast, brunch, lunch, or coffee. I've gone a few times late on weekend mornings and was thrilled that there wasn't any sort of crazy wait. The food quality is amazing from what I've tried!  I highly recommend their French toast. I find a lot of French toasts to be dry and nothing exciting, but their's is tender and moist on the inside, but the crust still gives it some substance. It also has this light citrusy flavor to it that I love!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is awesome. We came here at 8 on Sunday morning and there was already a line (the line moved quickly and the service was fast and prompt). We ordered breakfast wrap, croque madame and frenchie. Everything was delicious and fresh. I even liked their coffee here (I'm picky about my soy latte). The decor here is really cute and cozy. I don't really have negative things to say about this place (except wish it was closer to my house....Hahahah)  Love everything from the food to the decor, vibe and atmosphere. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Semi-fast casual breakfast, lunch, and brunch place. The food is amazing quality, touting organic options, mostly locally sourced, vegetarian and gluten free possibilities. I had the French toast (the top seller) which was a locally prepared hard French bread dusted with cinnamon and powdered sugar with a citrus glaze, dipped in maple and a side of fruit. The last had the heirloom tomato (caprese) salad topped with bright flowers.   The high point aside from the great flavor and freshness was the presentation. One wouldn't expect it from such a casual affair (which has high rolling lawyers and even the Mayor of Phoenix dining on occasion.)  The low point is the portion size which isn't huge but don't let this deter you because where quantity only slightly lacks, the quality makes up for it quickly.   The owner is a super genuine and nice guy and the staff is happy to help and informative. One of the best local spots we've been to in a while."}
{"text":"The food here was clearly good quality. I do recommend the avocado toast, it has really great flavor. Add an egg or it may be a little dry!  The omelet was fluffy but packed with tons of cheese. However it seemed to be enjoyed.   I took away a star based on portions to price. The toast about 8 dollars and it was the smallest piece of toast I've seen! I was still so hungry after, I would recommend getting a side along. I should have also purchased a pancake. Otherwise, it was a great order at the counter and sit Location. Very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite breakfast spots. We've tried lots of items on their menu and everything has been delicious. They've got breakfast classics and then dishes with their twist on it if you want to try something new and unique. Their breakfast potatoes might be the best I've ever had. You can tell how fresh everything is. The red haired girl who works the counter is the absolute sweetest and always gives top notch service and takes everyone's order super quickly. With such a wide variety of options, I don't think I'll ever get sick of this place."}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast spot! Haven't tried lunch but menu looked just as good as breakfast! Hey offer a full bar option with mimosas, bloody Mary's and sangria etc!! I would say on the weekend try to make it before 10 less busy just like anywhere in uptown area! Great service ! Amazing lattes and coffee!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the food, the coffee, the bar everything. I was really surprised by the decor. They use meat that is hormone free, free range,  and beef that is grass feed. I got the breakfast wrap. It has chorizo, egg, cheese, and potatoes wrapped in a tortilla.  It came cut in half, with the outside tortilla cooked perfectly to a crisp. It has really surprising how one little thing like crisping the outside tortilla can change the dynamic of a simple chorizo burrito. I loved it. My fiancée got some banana pancakes and she feel in love with them. One thing that is hard to find for some reason is pancakes that have bananas cooked into them instead of them stacked on top. The had a pretty big menu for breakfast and lunch. Their coffee was wonderful as well. I loved how relaxed the environment was. This place needs to be more popular. Definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Friendly and efficient customer service, great food, awesome atmosphere. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Fame has amazing food + coffee! Always love the atmosphere and the excitement in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Pros: Good coffee, drinks and cocktail selection.   Oats were good.  Cons: Croque Madame was less than stellar.  They use a heavy nine grain with a thick crust.  I'm not trained in French cuisine do I can't comment on the proper protocol for this dish, but I will say it was super heavy and lacked flavor.  Maybe it was my own fault for thinking a sandwich with béchamel wasn't going to be heavy.  Brick-like though.  Service was good overall.  Central Phoenix is more hipster every time I come back..."}
{"text":"My only warning: they're closed on Mondays.  The atmosphere is terrific.  The repurposed boards on the walls, the crazy light fixture over the communal dining table, even the egg crates on the ceiling are all terrific.  I ordered a bacon/avocado burger an absolutely loved it.  Even the fries were terrific.  My friend ordered the croque madame (madame because it comes with an egg) and while he didn't share,  he did say it was terrific as well.   Looking forward to finding an excuse to go back for breakfast sometime soon."}
{"text":"I am horribly upset with myself for never having review this place before! If you're in the area, and you have not been down here, there's something wrong with you! Hack, even if you have to travel to get here, you need to be here. The food is wonderful, the Ambiance amazing, and the people who work here truly nice.   I've had the privilege of meeting the owners on more than one occasion, and they are just people you want to do business with. Support your local places and I recommend the breakfast wrap!"}
{"text":"It was my first visit at this establishment and I was a happy customer after eating here. I like the ambiance and the food is fresh. Their coffee was freshly brewed and the service was great!   I like the fast paced where you come in, place your order, pay, sit and wait for your food. The food came pretty fast considering it was a Sunday and it was busy. I'll definitely be back there soon!"}
{"text":"went here just to see the outdoor mural on their back wall by artist Andrew Brown.  Impressive. So I went inside to see their menu. So simple loved it. I had the chicken quesadilla. it was perfect casual, and they use great ingredients and local when they can. chef and cook is very conscious of using clean and local ingredients. iced tea was also very fresh and took basic iced tea to another level."}
{"text":"Delicious food (I had the Parisian omelette- so tasty). Great atmosphere (combination of local breakfast casual with trendy). Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!  Great food and great price.  The  service is fantatstic too.  We have definitely added this place to our favorites."}
{"text":"I would actually give it between four and five stars--it was really good!  I had breakfast for lunch and it was awesome.  The staff was friendly and efficient and the decor was tasteful and relaxing.  I will eat there again!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I usually add ketchup or salsa to my eggs but did not have to because it was seasoned and cooked so well. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I LOVE this place! However, as of last week we were really disappointed in their coffee. Their food is great, the tea is perfect---and the coffee use to be the best in downtown Phoenix. I sincerely hope Fame looks into this issue to see what things changed recently!! Also, I cannot for the life of me understand why they don't open until 7am. They serve coffee yet I'd venture to say they are losing out on a lot of potential revenue by not being open earlier...and not staying open later."}
{"text":"Had the parfait this morning. My favorite part of it all was the fact that it was real greek yogurt. The berries were on point and im pretty sure the granola was homemade"}
{"text":"We love coming here for brunch. It's very kid and dog friendly! Great neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"I really love this place.  The food is top notch.  The decor is nice.  Great location.  It feels exactly like you want it to; comfortable, clean, fun and relaxing.  The only drawback is the service.   The interior is really nice.  It seems like a country chic cafe.  The seating looks like you won't find anywhere but then it works out.   Waiting for food does not take long.  The food is great.  It tastes fresh and freshly made.  The menu offers a lot o choices and slightly exotic fare.  The prices are reasonable for the food you are getting. Their drip coffee is good.    I have been to this place often enough to know two things.  I'm going to enjoy the food and I am not going to enjoy ordering my food.   While wait staff, managers and everyone else is friendly and outgoing, the people taking your order at the counter and the coffee barista will make me feel like I am bothering them and I am stupid.  Basic questions either go unanswered or are answered with attitude.    Overall that brief experience at the counter is no reason not to come to this restaurant.  You will really enjoy 95% of the experience."}
{"text":"This is a great coffee shop! I got the iced vanilla latte which I think is better than Lux. It was not too sweet and not bitter. Delicious. We got the banana jam muffin, poppyseed orange muffin, steal cut oatmeal, and the Parisian omelette. Everything was perfect. The muffins were still warm and the jams were all homemade. The omelette was tasty and a good size. Oh, and the decor was so cute! They have a farmhouse style going on that would make Joanna Gaines proud. Much more comfortable to sit in and enjoy your breakfast than Lux. My new favorite coffee shop in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"10x better than the first visit. We stopped in by chance one of the days they first opened and it felt incomplete. No lunch menu and limited options. Today was a 180. Had fresh juices, the counter server offered her favorite and it had very nice balance to it. Ordered the spinach and mushroom omelette and it was perfectly cooked. The cheese and mixins were abundant and the fruit bowl was substantial.  I like the toast they use, lots of grains and flavor. I was playing with the baby and letting him eat some fruit and they brought us over a brownie. Nice people, maybe Spanish decent. Just a true love for hospitality and care for the guests in the building. Great job!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Portions are on the small side. Some items on the menus are really good like the pancakes."}
{"text":"The line was at the door on Sunday morning. It looks small on the outside but spacious on the inside. The line moves slow but the food got to our table surprisingly fast. I was prepared to wait but super happy that I didn't have to. Everything on the menu looked good but I especially enjoyed the mimosa. The staff is genuinely attentive."}
{"text":"Best crouqe madame in the city, paired with the absolute best french fries that I've ever discovered. The chef explained the french fry process to me which he articulated has if an artist describing the process of his latest masterpiece. If for no other reason I recommend individuals try this aesthetically well put together breakfast and lunch nook for the fries, crispy exterior with a smooth delicate center. These guys are knocking it out of the park, unfortunately I can't get past the fabulous French, (crouqe madame). The only downside if any was a young lady who I assume is a server with pigtails and glasses seemed a little frustrated when I entered to order food at 20 minutes until closing, she made a point to look at the clock when I was standing at the register, when I asked if there was enough time to dine, she responded, \"yeah you got 20 minutes\"."}
{"text":"This place has potential, but it still needs to work out afew kinks. For example, packaging of to-go orders.... You never put an omelet with moist fruit in a box together. You can however, 1.) place fruit in a small cup ( preferred method) or 2) have some type of a divider between warm and cold food. I guess for potatoes, since they are usually hot, you can place together with an omelet? Another issue is the amount of ingredients in your omelet. I got the \" Gruyere omelet\" which is suppose to have cheese, onion, spinach, and mushroom( but I said no mushrooms please), and maybe something else? I could not taste anything but eggs. And when I opened up the omelet there were no onions and very little cheese and spinach( like 2-3 leaves). No favor or excitement. Very disappointing.     The salsa taste old. It's not fresh and saucy. Could not help make up for the plain and tasteless Omelet. : (   But it's only been open for 3 weeks so they say. So I will give them the benefit of the doubt... I should have checked my food before I left.  On a positive note, the coffee and the customer service were good. I'm sure this place will be able to work out these errors and become successful."}
{"text":"Went here with a girlfriend for brunch. I don't entirely love waiting in a line to order for brunch, but we had some delicious food come to us. I had the breakfast sandwich and it was pretty legit for the layout of this type of breakfast establishment. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Great new brunch spot.  Food is local, fresh and tasty.  Best cooked omelets in town - one of the very few places that knows how to cook an omelet and doesn't overcook the eggs.  Friendly service and the nicest owner.  If you're really lucky, it'll be one of the days they make their homemade strawberry jam.  The only times I've bitten into toast and said \"that's amazing\" - and I overheard a couple of the other tables make similar sentiments."}
{"text":"Not horrible, but we won't be itching to go back anytime soon!  - Ambiance & location-great  - Service is slow, line moves like molasses  They do offer samples of pastries while you wait, which is nice but I prefer faster service.    - food is sub-par/edible. We had pancakes (nothing special but good) & steel cut oats...  Okay, $7 for a bowl of steel cut oats with fruit seems ok, until you see the type if random fruit put on top---mine had watermelon and grapes, REALLY?! I mean I know those are cheap but c'mon...I've had my share of oats from many places. So odd considering blackberries and blueberries are in season, tasty & so inexpensive right now. Could also use a few nuts (such as carmelized pecans or others) to add to it. I know the use local produce but there's such a good variety at any local farmers market which go much better with oats.  Anyway, like I said, won't be stopping by again anytime soon :)"}
{"text":"I don't know why it took me so long to check this place out. The prices are reasonable and the food is AMAZING. I love the laid back vibe. I'd much rather relax here for brunch than somewhere with an hour wait and lots of noise and chaos. The breakfast tacos and half iced/half hot Fame mocha are so bomb!"}
{"text":"Just happened to be passing by this place while I was looking food. I was immediately hoping it was good just by how cool and nicely done it looked from the outside.  From the patio seating, to the wood \"V\" beams, to the very cool flip up window counter (allowing you to sit inside, but out), to the music and distressed wood, and even the stainless steel water cups you fill from the 25L fusti....this place is cool, relaxed, and clean. Now, most importantly, I am excited to report, Delicious as well!!  For your first time here do yourself a favor and order the Croque Monsieur. This is an item you are not going to find just anywhere and boy do they do it right!!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Had the quiche with a side salad, quiche was delicate and delicious . Great bottomless coffee.  I will be back for lunch and have a cocktail  Very reasonably priced,  great value for such awesome food."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best brunch in Phoenix. If there's a line, trust me, it is well worth the wait! Everything was tremendous and pretty affordable for the area. The only downside is that there isn't one closer to my house! The best coffee I've had in a very very long time. Keep slaying the brunch game Fàme, we'll be back."}
{"text":"It is delishuuuus. And nice service!! Really nice decore and clean place Short time waiting on food, cashier nice,friendly and patient"}
{"text":"I went to Glendale AZ for spring training and I always look forward to a good breakfast when I'm out of town! I looked up breakfast spots and Fàme came out as a top pic. When we arrive I was a little unsure if the taste of the food was going to be good as this place looked really trendy! We ordered three different plates and it was all delicious! Our favorite was the French toast very fresh and tasted great!"}
{"text":"I've eaten and I can't get up  Wonderful Friday breakfast. Ordered at the counter and grabbed a table outside. Food was delivered to our table in no time, hot and fresh.  Hubby enjoyed a chilaquiles skillet. In fact, he enjoyed it so much that he bought a bottle of their house hot sauce. Our daughter loves French Toast so in her honor I ordered that dish. The bread was crispy on the outside and not gooey on the inside. Berries accompanied the dish. Of course I had to send a pic of my breakfast to you know who.  The tab for breakfast with coffee and ice tea was $26."}
{"text":"Came here for a later breakfast around 9:30am on a Saturday morning. Pretty busy but we managed to get a table for two with no problem. I ordered the breakfast wrap with chorizo eggs and cheese and it was pretty darn good. The wrap was packed pretty tight and the salsa that they served with it complimented it very well. I would order it again. A little pricey at around $9 but that's pretty much the standard nowadays. Coffee was very good too and I like how it's self serve so you can make it the way you like it. Would come back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Super fun and cute atmosphere and setting. Food is great and service is friendly. Have only tried breakfast  here but would definitely come back.  The only thing I would say is bad is that the board for the menu is really hard to read, the menu is scribbles on the board so it makes it difficult to see exactly what is on the menu. And the colors for the lunch menu you can't really read.  Other wise this place is great."}
{"text":"My neighborhood gem! Great vibe, great service, great food - consistently. Steph is the happiest employee I have ever seen! Always have been there for breakfast - can't wait to try dinner there soon."}
{"text":"This place is adorable! I love the bar and egg crates on the ceilings. They're menu accommodates to all of my family's dietary restrictions (vegetarian, dairy free, gluten free) and has delicious food! Plus people here were nice. I ordered the avocado grilled cheese which had spinach on it. It was one of the best dang grilled cheeses I've had in a while. I LOVED the crispy cheese on the ends of the sandwich, my boyfriend was definitely trying to steal bites of it haha. Side salad was good too! Pickle tasted funky to me, I think because I was expecting dill but instead it was almost sweet-tasting. My boyfriend got the croquet madame which looked like a masterpiece! He said a little bit too much cheese but otherwise really good and filled him up. My sister got fruit and roasted veggies, both delicious. My mom got some kind of turkey sandwich but without bread and they were happy to accommodate, she liked it! My dad got a buffalo chicken sandwich and it was huge, he said he enjoyed his meal too. We also got tea which was tasty. I'd be glad to come back!"}
{"text":"The food was too good that I forgot to take photos! I had the avocado grill cheese and mimosa. The bread was the highlight of the dish - it was crispy on the outside and soft inside. The grill cheese connected the two pieces of bread, and blended well with the butter on the bread. The side salad with the dish was very fresh and balanced the dish very well. It was so yummy! The mimosa was ok, nothing as outstanding as the bread. I went at around 2pm on a Sunday, so there were many empty tables. Good place to chill and work in the afternoon when it's not too busy. Cute place and I will definitely go bk and share more photos later!"}
{"text":"OMG this place knocked me off my feet!  The food is delicious and very reasonably priced!  I came in for brunch with a friend.  We both left very impressed.  The only bad part is trying to find a parking spot (but hey it's the middle of phoenix what do you expect right).  Definitely a place worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! They had no problem making    an omelette into a scramble for me. It was prepared perfectly and with just eggs no milk added  The toast on the side was very fresh and tasty, possibly made in house. The jam was definitely made in house and it was possibly the best jam I have ever had. Now about the service... Everyone was fabulous and generous !"}
{"text":"The ordering/seating process is a bit odd but it somehow works for this place.  The service is great and the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"What an amazing find! My husband took me here for breakfast and all I could think was, \"why did it take so long to find this place?\" It's delicious! I had the steak and eggs - because it's my birthday... and I can. I come from a family that raises beef cattle so I KNOW a good steak. This steak was perfect!!! Great cut, juicy, well seasoned (NOT too salty - my peeve), and cooked to perfection!! Eggs were... Eggs. The house potatoes were great - not greasy or overcooked. We will definitely be back! Now... off to continue the celebration!!"}
{"text":"Been in for coffee a few times and really enjoy their house brew. I also like that it's self-serve but they keep it stocked. Between the coffee, ample seating, and atmosphere, Fame is as good a place as any on Central to grab a cup.   Finally tried Fame for breakfast last weekend. We had the croque monsieur and the berry parfait. Both were excellent and the service was prompt and friendly. Going to have to head back someday in the evening to see what all that cocktail ware on display might have to offer..."}
{"text":"Came back today for the second time. Ordered the french toast- dennys french toast is 100x better. I do love the ambiance so I will come back. I hopefully dont have to order each dish from the menu in order to feel satisfied with my meal"}
{"text":"Fresh, great tasting food and coffee.  Friendly staff. This place is a great addition to the area."}
{"text":"Met some friends and clients there for brunch today, having never been there but they had highly suggested it, having been there prior.   One walks in, and I see it is not a regular sit down and get served kind of place.   Instead, one stands in line, peer at the board with the menu, orders, and the food is brought to the table.   The staff is very friendly and efficient.   I was thinking of having something like the french toast or pancakes, but decided on something healthier.   I ordered the huevos rancheros, deciding to give it a try, as opposed to the omelet, especially since the omelet comes with three eggs versus the huevos rancheros comes with two.   I supposed I could have ordered an omelet with two eggs, thinking back. ...   Oh, well.   Next time.  ...  My friends suggested the croquet madame and the croquet monsieur.   Since I'm not really fond of bread, decided against it, albeit they ordered it and both dishes looked good.   One friend ordered the avocado toast, which had a HUGE half of an avocado on toast.   I really didn't know avocados were that large!  She ordered an egg to top it.  Another person ordered a breakfast sandwich and I can't remember what everyone else ordered.   Everything looked great, though.   My huevos rancheros came with two eggs atop a tortilla with black beans.  It was good, albeit I am not a fan of corn tortillas either.   I think it would have been better with maybe a flour tortilla on the side, especially since I like flour tortillas much better than the corn.   It was the right mix of flavors, seems somewhat healthy, not overly large so one walks out of the restaurant stuffed.   It must be unlimited coffee since one can refill ones cup till. ...  I do see they have wi fi, and I might go back to try maybe some of the potato dishes as well as maybe an omelet or the pancakes or French toast.   It is not so noisy that one cannot have a conversation.   The food is fairly inexpensive, most of the dishes are $8-$9.  It is right on Central Ave., and one can easily hop on and off the light rail.   Next to a bunch of other restaurants that I've been, whether for happy hour, dinner, lunch; therefore, convenient location.   It is only open till 3:00, therefore, good for breakfast or lunch.   Yes, I would definitely return. ..."}
{"text":"This place was the cutest! Very hipster-California-coffee-shop feel, in a great way. Awesome outdoor seating and really cool wooden benches/tables inside!  The food was delicious, we split a Mexican chorizo breakfast burrito and a oatmeal with fresh fruit. (Too much food). Both were delicious, the chorizo (which I believe they source locally?) was out of this world.   Also ordered iced coffee and a fresh grapefruit juice; juice was served in a mason jar- so cute.  They have a parking lot which was helpful! The guy taking our order (owner, maybe?) was SUPER nice, didn't rush us, and offered suggestions when we were trying to figure out what to order. He Clearly takes pride in the place!"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad, it's just not THAT good in my opinion. I have nothing really to complain about other than that the food isn't as good as the price may suggest it to be. $28 + tip got us two sandwiches (of which one was a grilled cheese), one order of fries, tea and an 8 oz diet coke.   There are better options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Wow. Charming, friendly, clean and delicious!!! Hubster had the huevos rancheros and I had the croque Madame and we were not disappointed. Everything was perfectly prepared! Fresh squeezed orange juice served in a mason jar. Can't wait to bring my girlfriends. Soooo good!!!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute cafe and I wish I lived closer!  We found this place on Yelp while heading into central PHX one Saturday and decided to stop by for a lighter lunch.  My boyfriend is obsessed with buffalo chicken sandwiches/wraps/pizzas so of course he ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich here.  I took a bite and have to say, it is the BEST buffalo chicken sandwich I've ever had!!  The difference between the food here and a lot of other places is the quality of ingredients.  The chicken tasted fresh, not drenched in buffalo sauce to hide the day-old taste like other places.  They use Noble Bread, which was delicious and chewy.  The green heirloom tomato gave the sandwich a delightful crunch.    It looks like they try to locally source their ingredients, which is great.  Service is very noncommittal hipster vibe, hence the 4 stars.  All in all, a great place for good food.  Highly recommended if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Perfecto! My partner and I have been returning here on a weekly basis, and have yet to be disappointed.  The meals are delicious and handcrafted, using only the freshest of local ingredients. The menu changes based on ingredients available, so check back often.  The staff here are a cut above the rest, and consistently friendly. The owners are usually very visible, and tends to every detail.  The food is reasonably priced, considering the wholesome quality."}
{"text":"My best friend and I came here for brunch one Saturday after a bit of thrifting, and we really enjoyed Fàme Caffe! The atmosphere is really cute and cozy, and they made us feel very welcome. They answered all of my questions about their menu items and accommodated my cravings for something unique.   I ordered the special of the day with a few changes, which was essentially prosciutto toast and jam with a soft and creamy cheese. It came with a refreshing side salad. My girlfriend ordered the quiche of the day with a side salad, and said it was lovely.   This is a nice place to sit and chat while enjoying a casual brunch or lunch. I wish it was closer to me because we'd come more often!"}
{"text":"This place is fun, right in the heart of the heart of good food - Central PHX!  Shabby sheik interior that's clean and spacious.  They make, bottle, and sell their own hat sauce.  You'll want to try it and maybe take a bottle home.  Food quality was amazing.  Buffalo chicken sandwich was very large and enough to split.    Here is why I rated 4 stars versus 5.  Had the BLT toast.  This is served open faced with thick bacon, light cheese, avocado, tomato, lettuce.  About $10 is my memory.   I presumed that my portion was the lunch sized as it was rather small for an entree sized sandwich.  In retrospect, I think the name of the sandwich alludes to it being open faced and a half sandwich."}
{"text":"Breakfast tacos - Really thought these were more egg based but were mostly mashed potatoes and black beans with really fresh cilantro.  Latte was very good.  Busy place, would try it again but make a different breakfast selection."}
{"text":"Ehhhhh...I generally trust yelp reviews but me and my family were disappointed and had high expectations based on the reviews. We all wished we had ordered something else. Basically, we all thought the food was mediocre.    But I'd give it four stars for ambience. It is definitely a cute place. And the staff is organized. Don't let the line fool you. It moves quickly and the food didn't take a long time to be served."}
{"text":"Where do I start........Sunday afternoon it was pouring rain and we all know that it's rare for it to rain in AZ.   My girlfriends and I decided to have brunch at Fame. I couldn't wait to taste everything on the menu.....  First things first.....you have place an order before you can be seated so if your going to have a large group you need to have someone get there early to place everyone's order.   As our group trickled in each one of us had to wait in line to place an order. We had a nice waitress who let all of us be seated as she took our orders...  Let's get to the food...... aghhhhhhhh I wanted to love this place, I really did..... but when I ordered the Huevos Rancheros... it was a soupy mess. Look I get it.... everything is organic. I love organic but I know organic taste good. This didn't taste remotely good. It was bland and the tortillas were hard and cold. The egg was cold!! I  hate hate, hate cold eggs.....    Still hungry I reached over to my girlfriends plate to try her French toast..... what the @%#%...it was dry..... DID I CRACK A TOOTH....  I took one for the team and didn't complain....I just continued to eat hoping it would get better.   As I'm washing down this meal with an blood orange mimosa which by the way was so tart everyone on the table had to add a package of sugar to it. YES....THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE THAT I EVER HAD TO ADD A PACKET OF SUGAR TO A MIMOSA!!!  Okay..... so the vanilla honey latte was amazing and so was the bacon.    I actually place another order for bacon.....  Look people love this place.... maybe it was a bad day considering it was pouring outside.   Food should make you feel good and warm your soul....  Fame just didn't do it for me.... a quick latte, a muffin and scone. I'll show up but for brunch I'll pass...."}
{"text":"We just had a delicious breakfast. I had an omelette and my husband had one of their specials, short rib enchiladas. Both dishes were really good. The ambience of this place and the food presentation were spot on. I'm looking forward to coming back to try lunch."}
{"text":"We stop by this place very clean excellent services and the breakfast was awesome they have a variety of breakfast menu end it up getting 2 plates .and penny our server was delightful stop by this place if you are in the area you are in for a treat.."}
{"text":"Met some friends here for brunch. We got real lucky as we were a party of 12 and the big community high top had cleared just as we got there. The concept is fast casual and you move through the line pretty quick even on a busy Saturday. The black iced tea was OK. I had the Croque Madame. It looks deceptively small when plated but it was very filling and being made with 9 grain bread it made for a more relaxed eating pace, I loved it. I also got to try the breakfast wrap and it was good too. One of our party got an egg that was still clear and it was immediately cleared and a new plate brought out in short order. The owner/manager? came back twice to make sure their second try was acceptable. The servers were also the bussing staff and whatever else needed attention and it worked smoothly. The patio is dog friendly."}
{"text":"What a great place! Went there for a coffee date and found out that it closed at 3pm, but the owners opened it up for us!! We chatted for about 15 minutes and they ended up giving us our coffee for free! Great cold brew, cool space, good vibes. Overall on point. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Had the cheese quesadilla and a chai tea. It was delicious and refreshing overall. The service was great. Next time I'm trying something different."}
{"text":"This place is delightful! We had the omelette and chorizo breakfast wrap, 2 mimosas and an espresso for $34. The staff was so polite and helpful, offering suggestions that fit our mood. We're very happy we stopped here and would stop again. The decor was also very quaint and welcoming."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here since day one of opening and seen the caffe change quite often. The prices are quite high but that what you get to have for farm to table. Over all i will continue to come here. I feel that they need to get rid of the planters outside it makes it hard to get into. Big Pro.  They now serve wine"}
{"text":"Great spot love the food and lots of drink options easy to lounge at and grab a bite. Came for brunch the quiche is fantastic"}
{"text":"My favorite coffee place! I sometimes bring my laptop and work for hours at this restaurant. Great breakfast options and friendly staff!   A must try :)"}
{"text":"Exceptional breakfast this Easter morning.  The omelette sweet ordered were perfect.  We ordered two sides of bacon (1 for each of us) and ended up with enough for lunch.  Service was quick and friendly.  Planning to return for lunch sometime!"}
{"text":"Winner winner! Are you a hipster foodie? Looking for a daytime workspace to eat and chill? A person who gets hungry sometimes? If you meet any of these criteria, you will love Fa-me Cafe."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere and super tasty menu!  Order at the counter and find your own seat with you number. Good options for non-dairy eater and plenty of healthy options."}
{"text":"Service here is great and the food came out really fast!  Stephanie at the register is super nice and keeps the line moving fast!  Jasmin who helps to seat you was super nice, and the other girl who brought out our food was extra helpful.  It's got a nice vibe and many yummy looking things on the menu.    For our first visit, we ordered the veggie scramble (2 eggs, goat cheese, mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower), which comes with toast and house potatoes for $8.95.  It was good.  The potatoes were too salty for my husband;  I'm a salt addict and thought they were amazing.  The coffee was also good.    We came back two days later and tried the \"Frenchie Toast ('Pain Perdu' style country bread & cinnamon & powdered sugar & berries)\" for $9.50.  I loved it more than my husband, but he's not as much of a French toast person.  I'd give it a 10 out of 10...perfect bread, texture, and flavor.  You get four slices with maybe 12 berries and real maple syrup!  We also ordered the \"avocado toast\" from their lunch menu (\"sea salt & sesame seeds & cilantro & chimayo pepper & lemon vinaigrette\") for $7.  We added a side of seasonal veggies for $4.  Both were fine for what they were.. Really healthy food, though I should've asked for whole wheat toast.  Definitely would return!"}
{"text":"We were heading downtown and decided to stop by. The place is well kept up and looks nice. The patio is cute. It seemed a little dark so we ate outside and the seating was pleasant. We ordered the chorizo burrito which was a little spicy but good. We also had the chef special which was the braised pork belly burrito. It tasted mostly like bland potatos but had plenty of pork belly. The burritos were a good size. We also ordered coffee which came in cute mason jars. I enjoyed my coffee. I gave it 4/5 mostly because of the pricing. I felt the coffee was a little on the pricier side. The burritos didn't really stand out for their price. I would definitely try this place again in hopes of getting something better. You order at the counter and they bring you your food, so you choose your seating. I thought everyone was polite. So I had a pleasant experience, I just didn't find the food we ordered as something I would order again."}
{"text":"The staff here are amazing.  Very attentive and always carrying a smile.  The restaurant itself is very clean.  The decor is very refreshing and the seating is plentiful.  We chose to sit outside which can lead to being forgotten, but the wait staff checked on us regularly.    The food wasn't fantastic, but not bad.  My wife had the Mushroom Omelet.  The onions and mushrooms were tasty, but the eggs were bland.  It seemed to lack simple flavorings such as salt.  She ordered a muffin as well which was very soft, fluffy and tasty!  I had the short rib sandwich.  It to was just bland.  The short ribs really didn't have any flavor other that of cooked beef.  I chose a side order of fries which unfortunately were raw.  This was a disappointment especially for the price point of entrees.  Give this place a little bit to get in their groove.  If they can spice up the food a little, this place will be another phoenix hotspot."}
{"text":"All I can say is Croque Madame.  All day, everyday.  I want to try something else, but have been unable since this little (ok, not so little) gem entered my life.  Delicious.  Lovely atmosphere and staff, great place to bring out-of-town guests, your dog, or just yourself."}
{"text":"Veggie scramble is my go-to. Perfectly made with multigrain bread and crispy potatoes. Horchata latte on the side-good to go!!!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to come back!! Came here for breakfast with the husband and the pups. They have a little patio area that is dog-friendly. Came here around 10 on a Sunday morning and we didn't have too wait long for our food! You walk in and order and then find a seat and they bring the food to you. I ordered a daily special which was eggs benedict. Sooooo good! I thought it beat Snooze. The sauce was different, it tasted amazing though. The dish was amazing and just the right amount to fill me up which was perfect! My hubby got the breakfast wrap which basically seemed like a breakfast burrito. He got it with chorizo and it came with this bomb salsa! Definitely a good size as well. For the price not only are you getting amazing food, but a good serving, too. Overall, cute little place. Glad we finally were able to try it! Oh, and they have a bar! So if you're looking to have a mimosa or something, they've got you covered :) Looked like a full bar. Five stars all the way! Thanks Fame, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Do you believe in love at first sight or love at first taste? Well, skeptics - I freaken do! I fell in love with this place once I set eyes on it. It is so damn cute - earthy, rustic, open, and NOT busy!! Oh hell yea.  Then I fell in love again when I tried their almond milk vanilla latte and the food. The coffee was so good (better than Lux) and the size/portion is great. The small is a good size. The overeasy plate (bacon, eggs and potatoes) was delightful especially the potatoes and bacon. They were crunchy and just melt in your mouth good! The pancakes were one of the best pancakes I've tried! The service was great too - they offered a bowl of water for my dog, which was sweet.  The tab ended up to be close to $30 - I agree the prices here are a little steep, but it's more like a 5 step hill steep, not a damn mountain. I will take this any day then to wait for an hour somewhere.  This will definitely be my go-to spot for coffee and breakfast from now on. Lots of parking and a mile away from me."}
{"text":"True gem! Surprisingly varied menu... I had a hard time deciding what to order. Decided on a tasty veggie scramble, my guy ordered simple over easy eggs and bacon which were also delicious. Everything that came out of the kitchen looked amazing. Can't wait to try the chiliquilles next time! And the coffee... SOOOO GOOOOOD. Such a friendly place too...the people who worked there and the customers. We sat on the patio with our happy dog after the server gave him a treat. Our new fave place for breakfast."}
{"text":"I was craving french toast and when I saw the pictures of their french toast I was sold. They look perfect in every way but truthfully they were not what the picture portrays. They were crunchy which is not a texture I like to have when eating french toast. A lot of it also had to do with the syrup. It had such an odd taste to it, it was not sweet as you would expect any syrup to taste. Ending off on a good note though, the service was really nice and the atmosphere of the location is awesome."}
{"text":"I only stopped in for coffee so can only speak to that. I was in Phoenix for a few days for work. This is the place to go for organic coffee and milk. I looked everywhere.  They are excellent."}
{"text":"Great choice for supberb food for breakfast.  Had the quiche with greens and oatmeal comes with bluberried, sliced bananas and strawberries.  The atmosphere buzzes with the chatter and happy satisfied customers as well as the rustic astetic environment."}
{"text":"Delightful breakfast spot and cafe. Repurposed wood and brick walls, exposed ceilings, table settings that hearken to harvest time, a wonderful assortment of baked goods (such as the exceptionally buttery and flaky  chocolate croissant or the apple muffin that tastes like an apple fritter).  Great breakfast options here with local and organic products, seasonal fruits, and noble bread. I love that they feature Croque Monsieur, my favorite breakfast sandwhich with bechamel and gruyere (basically a savory  French toast sandwhich that Is out of this world.)"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and thought I need to give Fame a try. So glad I did, such great breakfast items and the coffee was delish!!!  This will be my new regular spot, I hope they extend their hours into the evening soon."}
{"text":"Counter service type of restaurant. Don't recall anything being spectacularly delicious. They do use authentic Mexican cheese on their enchiladas! Which is a plus! Centrally located, parking is a little cramped, since this place is located in a plaza."}
{"text":"Extraordinary service, Aimee at the bar is beyond exceptional!! The ambience, to the deliciousness of the food; the presentation is key!! Aimee at the bar provides you with non-stop service that makes you want to keep returning for an in and out brunch / breakfast. Fàme never fails ... Three thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Wonderfully delicious. Fàme offers a variety of amazing breakfast options each one offering amazing flavors. The omelet was probably the best omelet I have had. Simplistic and delicious. The variety of juices was awesome! Grapefruit lime was so good. The coffee is also good as I have been here a few times. The only downside is that it is so good it is often packed. On cooler days the patio is nice as well! I can't speak for the alcohol selection but I know it's offered as well. Order at the front and sit to have your food quickly delivered. All the staff is very friendly and inviting. A truly inviting fun atmosphere with amazing food to go with."}
{"text":"What happened??? We were obsessed with this place for a few months, going a few times a week. It was amazing - great service, delicious, beautifully-presented food. But then, there was a shift. Staff turn-over and a sudden change in the vibe. Food mostly still good, but seems like smaller portions? And less well-presented? And then there was the weird \"I hafta charge you by the size of the cup\" thing that happened to my husband (he likes a LOT of milk). I feel like this gem is tarnishing and it bums me out."}
{"text":"Best pancakes in town. I order the chocolate chip pancakes every time. Literally to die for! They are better than the pancakes from Snooze. They have bananas, Nutella or chocolate chip pancakes- it might be more simple than Snooze's options but man, simple might be the best! It's all in their batter too and they cook it perfectly! As I savor the flavor, I try to think what it is that makes it so fluffy and mouth watering.. I also have had the chorizo breakfast burrito/wrap and it's so flipping yummy as well!!! So if you are going for savory or sweet they have great options. The ambiance is relaxing and hip too! The gal at the cashier on Saturday mornings, is always energetic but not the overwhelming Dutch Bros energetic... it's the Sunday morning rain is falling happiness feeling.. slash who run the world? Girls! Kinda feeling and optimism vibe she gives me! But be careful, the line does get long at random times. Luckily I've been there around 8:30 and 10 am and there wasn't a line but then literally right after the line was up to the door."}
{"text":"Transformed previous coffee shop into a clean modern great place to eat sip and visit with friends. Attention by a expert staff to customers flows into the kitchen that uses great fresh ingredients. Am going through the breakfast menu and have yet to be disappointed! The croque madame is best outside of Paris! Heading into lunch menu next. Don't miss and BTW best scones sine Kohnie's on Cameback."}
{"text":"Super cute industrial design inside. Family-friendly (and just plain friendly in general). Nice patio (for when it's not 110+). Great location - we can walk across the street from St. Francis, and you're close to some other cute businesses. A pretty varied menu, including lots of hot and cold options. We liked everything we tried: chorizo burrito, breakfast sandwich, yogurt & granola bowl, pastries, and French toast. I love that they sell mimosas and bloody Mary's. Prices are pretty reasonable. One complaint: they don't really have specialty tea drinks for us non-coffee drinkers. They were nice enough to make us tea lattes, even though it wasn't on the menu, but they weren't great. To coffee shops everywhere: please start making matcha drinks! Even with that, I'll happily go back to Fame again and again."}
{"text":"Famé is such a comfortable warm, hip place. We love the quiche, served with a salad, the avocado toast (I add a poached egg, yum), and everything we have had there. Coffee drinks are available and delicious too. You'll be happy you found Famé"}
{"text":"Food was seasoned to perfection. Mimosa was light on OJ- just the way I like it. My picky 12 year old was upset with lines and crowd but was smiling when food poured out to our table.  Parisian egg whites meal, mimosa+ pancakes with egg scramble and lemonade. We are smiling! Nice job owners!!  These were the best damn pancakes I've ever had. I would never have imagined they'd be that great! :/)"}
{"text":"OOOO LA LA! My Hubby took me here for Mother's Day and it made for a very Happy Mother's Day INDEED!  The décor is very French country and super cute!  We went in ordered and the counter. took a number, had a seat and shortly later had a most enjoyable meal!  I had the grapefruit based Aqua Fresca and it was so refreshing!   The Croque Madame had the most amazing crusty bread, smothered in a delightful thinly sliced delectable ham and the cheese.... so freaking good! The Egg on top; made my mouth curtsy!!!!!!  We will definitely be back! I didn't realize this lil gem was hiding in my neighborhood less thana mile from my house! dangerous for my wallet and my waistline!"}
{"text":"My favorite Saturday morning breakfast spot. So much so that I don't tell anyone about it unless I really like you because I don't want to wait. Their coffee is the best in town, their breakfast is always on point and their amazing customer service makes me willing to get out of bed before 9 on the weekends. That should say a lot. Thank you fame!!"}
{"text":"A nice place to grab breakfast, brunch and lunch. I ordered the vegan quinoa salad, but I added chicken to it. It was average, as there are not enough vegetables in the salad, it was mainly quinoa. The soy sauce with sesame seeds I came with a salad as a dressing, was a nice touch where it added some flavor to it.. or a drink I ordered an Arnold Palmer and it was good.  I would definitely return to this place, only because I would like to try some of their sandwiches, they looked good And I definitely encourage you to take a look at the menu and try them out."}
{"text":"The vibe of the place is great. It's very clean and the staff was attentive. I had the chorizo breakfast burrito and my wife had the banana pancakes, both were fantastic. The barista, Ashley, was very friendly and made us two great Lattes. Overall the place exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great first impression. Friendly service, having a laidback casual breakfast. Did the typical fare of eggs, toast, pancake and sausage, just had to order it as three items. Everything cooked right, though sausage a bit tough and dry. (Maybe their style?) Nice city view from open bar area. Yep!  Ate it all!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. In the old Citizen coffee spot, they created a very cozy atmosphere. They have fresh fruit and veggie juices, coffee and great breakfast. Even french toast using Noble bread. Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Just putting it out there but I am by no means a morning person so having a brilliant place to go to whenever I'm not operational is spectacular.  THe service was friendly, answered all my redundant questions and were pep in the step which I needed to start off my day.  Their coffee is good to get the engines revving and their food selection is just what you need to make it till the late afternoon.  I love the decor and the atmosphere which kind of a reminds me of the northwest.  I'll be back for sure to try more."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot!  Trendy, not too noisy, pleasant staff, great food.  Will definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot.  Lots of interesting options for your meal and several pastries to fulfill your sweet-tooth.    I went with the breakfast wrap which was ample in size.  It was full of eggs, potatoes, chorizo, and cheese.  The wrap was delicious and the green salsa it came with complemented it well.  Additionally, because I'm a glutton, I had a scone.  There are a few different flavors to choose from and I went with the Vanilla/Almond/Strawberry.  It was excellent.  The iced coffee too was very good.  If you're into lattes and the like there is a coffee bar to meet your needs.  The decor of the restaurant is great and there is ample seating no matter your group size.  There are about 8 tables outside as well.    The prices are a bit steep.  My breakfast was $16.  I'll be back but due to that reason alone, it won't be as often as I'd like."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning, around 11:00. Just missed one rush and before another. Menu is actually more diverse then you may think. Wife got the breakfast sandwich special and I got the chorizo and egg breakfast burrito. Both items surprised us with how tasty they were. I also snagged a blood-orange mimosa. I love the whole laid-back casualness of the place. How the whole side of the restaurant opens up (probably best in the winter, spring and fall time frame.) And don't stress. You'll score a table, seat or chair. Service seems to be completely staffed by teenagers. And they don't miss a beat. Knowledgeable, efficient and super friendly. Not from Phoenix, but have already recommended it to my local friends and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place was better than I expected. I was a little disappointed that i couldn't get the croque madame with out the ham. I ended up having the chilaquiles and enjoyed them very much."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Pork belly wrap special was delicious. Spice level was perfect with slices of jalapeño hidden inside. Make sure to order at counter before you sit down."}
{"text":"Fame has been on my list for a number of years now. Unfortunately, when my girlfriend and I want breakfast, we always seem to skip these café-style places - and I'm not entirely sure why. I say it's because of their hours, although realistically, the hours are the same as any other breakfast/lunch joint that closes in the afternoon.  I ended up visiting Fame on a whim during a lunch break with a couple of work colleagues. Some quick research on Yelp made it obvious that the default recommendation appears to be the Croque Madame, which is a thick slick of bread that is topped with an egg (over easy in my case), ham, béchamel sauce, and gruyere cheese. The dish comes with a side of mixed greens.  Honestly, I was actually very impressed with this pretty straight-forward creation. It was nicely balanced, with nothing completely overpowering the combination. The bread itself was very good quality, with a nice toasted crunch and satisfying depth.   Their online menu says that they will have dinner coming soon, although I'm not entirely sure if that statement is current or still in their future plans.  Based on my single experience, I'd give them a solid four stars. Once I can drag my girlfriend here during a Sunday breakfast run, I intend to do some experimenting with the menu to see what else they have to offer and will update this review accordingly.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Second experience here now. This place is quaint and confortable. Every time I show up I'm suprised it's not busier than it is. They deliver coffee and food to your table via a number which they hunt down. Every employee is helpful, knowledgeable about their product and everyone is smiling. It isn't the closest shop to me, but it's quickly become my favorite. They have delicious (slightly over priced) breakfast and lunch. The chicken pesto sandwich is my go too. As well as a bar with breakfast cocktails, beer, and probably more if I was a bit more observant. Overall awesome place, 100 percent would recommend!"}
{"text":"One of the highest quality restaurant omelettes/meats we've found. We are nutrition coaches who place high emphasis on food quality and this place has it. Locally sourced, healthy animals and it's obvious in the flavor of the food. Well done."}
{"text":"This is really unfortunate. I've been coming here for at least 4-5 times in the past month and I always order the same thing- horchata latte and Parisian omelette. The food has always been good and the service is polite and consistent. But today... of all days... I ordered the same thing at 2pm and by 5pm I started to suffer what would be the worst case of food poisoning I've ever had in many years, maybe the worst yet. I've been in tears for the past 5 hours in my mom's bathroom in excruciating pain. My mom wants to take me to the urgent care, but I told her I'll be camping out in the bathroom cuz I don't feel safe. I don't know what happened, but something went wrong, maybe the inside of the omelette was undercooked, maybe the milk in the horchata latte went bad... I have no idea and may never know. All I know is I'm suffering from the only food I've had today and it's totally not cool. Now I can't come back because I'm scared I'll have to repeat this misfortune."}
{"text":"Today was my fourth time at Fáme. This is a really great caffe.   The first time I visited was just for coffee and juice with a friend. Fresh pressed veggie juice. The owners chatted with us for a moment. They were new. It was nice to see that they are genuinely local and care about their place, their people, their service, and their food.   The quality of food is wonderful and this is a very comfortable community gathering place with friendly service.   I love Fáme so much because it contributes to the Uptown Central Phoenix neighborhood as a whole. Good, local, quality. :)"}
{"text":"Good coffee, but pricy for lunch:/ Got the beetroot salad for brunch. Free wifi and really quiet. Just wish it wasn't so expensive:/"}
{"text":"Great Chilaquiles and scones.  Cool atmosphere.  Definitely a recommend.  Friendly staff and in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"fàme (pronounced fà-me) means hungry in italy and northern spain. At fàme caffe, classically trained chef Ivan prepares carefully sourced food with passion. His wife Maria, who grew up in the hospitality industry, creates a warm and ... blah blah blah blah ...  Okay, you get it. This place is all about passionate  ingredients. Feel free to read the rest of the fàme story online. We're here to talk about food! And damn, the the french toast was delicious on multiple levels. I had their frenchie toast [vg] \"pain perdu\" style + berries + 100% real maple syrup ... which is pretty much a really long way of saying, \"Damn! This sh** is good!\"  To add a little bit of salt to my pallet, I opted for the side of country sausage, which was savory. Every bite made a crisp snapping sound followed by an eruption of savory flavor in my mouth.  So, if you ever find yourself tired of waiting at Lux down the way, swing in. Place your order. Grab a sit (feel free to color on the table top butcher palate). And enjoy a passionately sourced meal ;)"}
{"text":"I had pancakes & french toast at Fa-me(not at same time!)  Both were excellent & beautifully prepared, plentiful & served with scrumptious, perfectly cooked bacon.  Apparent that these are REAL cooks who take pride in their work. The servers are professional, friendly & attentive.   Lovely atmosphere & meticulous. Highly recommend & definitely going back."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, wonderful menu, wonderful prices. It never disappoints. Of course it helps that the owners are an absolute joy. Even though it such a drive for me, it's totally worth it every time!! Definitely a jewel."}
{"text":"I have been here several times now and everything is consistently amazing! I highly recommend the chilaquiles and the pancakes are so good. Great spot!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite local breakfast spot! Great food and amazing service. My fav is the pork belly wrap. The green salsa they serve with it is amazing, great options for kids as well! Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"First time here and family really enjoyed it.  Definitely will be coming back.  The coffee bar was also a great compliment to the meal."}
{"text":"Got the breakfast sandwich with extra bacon, the buffalo chicken sandwich and a large iced caramel coffee.  The eggs were a little tasteless, the salad that came with the buffalo was over salted beyond imagination.  I love salty food and I love greens.  I couldn't finish it because there was nothing but salt on it. The buffalo sandwich was decent, had a good kick to it.   I certainly wouldn't say I won't be back.  It's cute and has a very relaxed atmosphere.  I'll definitely be back to try some other things off their menu."}
{"text":"Very cute breakfast/brunch place with amazing food and even better service. I came early on a Saturday morning (around 8:30am) so it wasn't crowded yet. As I left, however, it started to get really busy. I'd recommend coming before 9am if possible. There is free parking, but I think it could get filled up quickly during peak business hours.   I had the breakfast wrap with chorizo and it was delicious!! The orange juice was really good as well. The cashier who took our order was very friendly and had some great suggestions for what food to order. The food came very quickly and was hot and fresh. Great quality ingredients, especially in the orange juice. If I'm ever in Phoenix again I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I love salt.....no need here!  The Croquet Madam came highly recommended!  Crusty bread, amazing flavor...great atmosphere.  Anything and everything you could want for breakfast or lunch.  My husband had 2 meals and we both were impressed.  The chia tea was also wonderful no need for sugar.  I'm going back!"}
{"text":"Favorite brunch in Phoenix. I love the order up register and the at home feel of the place. From breakfast to lunch there are so many delicious choices. My faves are the petite madame and the quiche"}
{"text":"Very cute little breakfast/brunch joint. Wonderful adult breakfast beverage selection and the menu is varied and well done. We tried the breakfast burrito and breakfast sandwich and enjoyed both. Our friend ordered the chilaquiles and enjoyed those as well (found them a little soggy but ate every last bite). This place is a bit pricey but is a great pick for a special occasion. It is not very big and can be standing room only if you go during peak hours. The parking lot does get crowded but I found my overall experience here to be very positive."}
{"text":"Ok, this place was perfect.  Workers were all very pleasant.  Food was amazing, fresh, well planned, and creative.  Unfortunately, I don't live in Phoenix but this place would be a staple in my routine if I did."}
{"text":"Excellent local spot for breakfast, brunch, and coffee. Weekends it can get very busy so be prepared for a little wait. Some cute outdoor seating for when the temps are nice. My go to is the chilaquiles with avocado, but the banana Nutella pancakes are a close second! Their chai is sweet and smooth. Definitely a favorite of mine in central Phoenix! Would highly recommend. I wish they'd bring back their cream cheese berry muffins though. Original pastries from when they first opened were way better!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The food portions are quite small but it's bloody delicious. The taste, the presentation, the flavor, the quality of food, and the ambience. The pastrys are tasty, and the menu has great variations. The omelet is a must! The coffee is just perfect. Sometimes the service slows and requests take quite a time (we request a sauce at the beginning and got it at the end of meal). I'm becoming a regular to the spot!"}
{"text":"Phoenix has an incredible restaurant scene so when my travel takes me there it is always so hard to decide where to go - a place I never visited on one of my favorite haunts?  This morning on a whim I entered Fàme Caffe for with the intent to grab some breakfast then a cup of coffee to go.  I was immediately attracted to the look and ambiance of Fàme - open, bright and friendly.  However I have a strong dislike when restaurants have you order at the counter than bring your food to you.  I prefer the old fashioned wait staff.  In this case, I am glad I stayed instead of looking for a new restaurant.  Food was served fresh, hot and delicious.  My cappuccino did not look like any cappuccino I had been served before but was delightful.  Only when I ordered a coffee to go but asked to have it after I ate (not at the time I had to order and pay) did my customer service dip. The barista tried to have me take my cup then as it was \"easier\".  But my hostess took care of it in a very pleasant and professional manner.  Overall a great stop and would recommend Fàme Cafe."}
{"text":"Really great breakfast spot that is still \"semi\" hidden from hoards of Phoenix breakfast goers. My husband is obsessed with the croquet Madame and my son loved pastries before they revamped their menu over the 4th of July weekend. I don't think they have pastries anymore...they also have great fresh grapefruit juice!! We love it!"}
{"text":"Great location, food was good with healthy choices. Freshly squeezed juice. Over all it was descent."}
{"text":"I adore this spot.  Atmosphere - They do NOT overdo the hipster vibe. Chalk board menus, large enough space, I appreciate that they aren't trying hard. They have an indoor/outdoor bar that lines the restaurant for couples like me and my boyfriend AKA me always cold and he's warm enough to sit outside with the dog. Yes, dog friendly! They have little treats that are made by KAK and my dog ate those all up (but he'd probably eat anything). There are also full tables outside.  Their staff was fantastic -- Super friendly and professional. They were great to our pup and were quick to clean up any plates. They were extremely helpful and offered great suggestions.  I ordered an Iced Coffee which was not watered down and they were able to add some flavors of my choice. My boyfriend ordered the café con leche, one of his favorites and he highly suggests you try it.   My favorite part was the food. I ordered a side of tender belly bacon and their French toast. Their French toast is made on thick bread served with delicious maple syrup.  Some of this and a side of Tender Belly bacon, you are set to tackle the world. Their bacon was perfectly cooked, and I am actually drooling thinking about this meal."}
{"text":"So I loved the menu, great selection for breakfast and lunch. The pineapple mint limeade was really refreshing and the perfect thing to drink with my guajalote.   My only grievance is that when the server stopped off my food she told us where the silverware was and didn't just bring it with the meal. I mean it wouldn't be a big deal if the stand wasn't on the way to our table. I just don't understand why she couldn't just bring it with her."}
{"text":"Yum. Good food and great mimosas but expensive. I think we had a breakfast Sammy, breakfast burro and 4 mimosas in total and it was close to $60. Still a good vibe and good place so I don't regret it but for the price, there are other options out there."}
{"text":"Fame is really close to our apartment so we decided to go in and check it out before we went to the football game. The prices are a little high for a breakfast place but the food is phenomenal. Everything tastes extremely fresh and the juices, teas, etc are very good as well. I would highly recommend this place for a good breakfast, brunch, or lunch place. I believe they are going to start serving dinner soon as well."}
{"text":"My sister and I love getting brunch in this beautiful cafe. We love their delicious food which is so thoughtfully prepared by the talented chef. We always have their omelettes with the house cappuccino.  We recently tried their freshly squeezed orange and grape juice and they were fantastic.  Also, the level of hospitality and the quality of the customer service here is unrivaled.  We love this wonderful cafe. The relaxing ambiance and the tasty food never fails to impress us during our frequent visits."}
{"text":"Finally, was able to try this fantastic place for Sunday brunch.  Another great farm to table concept type restaurant/coffee shop.    Service was great, friendly, and quick to answer any questions we may have had.  We ordered the Persian Egg White Omelet ( so tasty and fresh ) and also ordered the Huevos Rancheros ( great flavor ) served in a cast iron skillet.    Overall pleasant experience and  will gladly add Fame to my brunch/coffee rotation when in the area.  Don't let any line or crowd deter you. Tables turn pretty quick and it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Why would I like Fa-me Caffe? I can't even pronounce it or spell it. Is it Fa'me with the French thing above the a? Or Fa-me with a hyphen? And don't get me started on the two Fs in Caffe. Ha ha. Who cares, cause the food is tres bon! Oh my god we loved it! We drive by all the time and just today went for the first time. I never order omelettes because I prefer eggs over easy or eggs Benedict. And if I do order an omelette I have to put ketchup on it. But Fa-me doesn't have eggs Benedict so now I am just pointing at things written on their menu board. My wife ordered the breakfast wrap and iced mocha. Well...now the fun begins. The mochas are fantastic. And we ran into a person my wife knows from high school. They raved about the oatmeal and said that is what they always order. Now I am wishing I had ordered oatmeal. Now for my food review. The food arrived and looked good. But tasted even better! My omelette with mushrooms and caramelized onions was so so good! I felt like I was in Paris sharing an incredible meal with my gorgeous wife at a cozy little French bistro. Of course I knew I was in America just by looking up at the egg cartons glued to the ceiling, and the 105 degrees outside - but still...such a great tasting, well thought out breakfast with crispy bacon just the way we like it - and the cheese in my light and fluffy omelette so perfect with the onions. I think you just converted me into an omelette lover. So perfect that if I were the chef and I saw a customer putting ketchup on it I'd throw them out of the restaurant immediately, lol. As for Rebecca's wrap full of potatoes, 5 stars from her as well! The green salsa is the best! And my wife is very picky about salsa. She is an Arizona native and knows her salsas. She said it was so fantastic she could drink it. Seriously. We bought more of it to take home. We don't have tortilla chips so we just may be drinking salsa tonight while reflecting on or wonderful 5 star experience at Fa-me Caffe with two Fs. We'll be back for sure. I'll be trying the oatmeal or possibly doing the omelette again with salsa on it this time!"}
{"text":"Cutest little spot right on Central Ave, great ambiance. Cashier is super friendly, food is good not great, latte was luke warm not hot, quiche was sold out at 11, and the line was long. Would come back to try specials!"}
{"text":"Fame is losing stars for their poor service. The last two times I have been there they have been out of coffee. I ordered coffee and waited for it to brew on both occasions. When it was finally done brewing I had already finished my breakfast. They should be prepared for the busy mornings with a back-up carafe, last time people waited in line for the one to be filled and then it was emptied again before everyone waiting was able to get a cup.   When I asked the server to pour me a cup from behind the bar she had major attitude.   The food is still delicious, but the service needs improvement."}
{"text":"Wow, did I come on a bad day?? If you like to grossly over pay for a much less than mediocre burger this is your spot. My wife and I just had the \"Fáme burger\" with waters (on the house) the total was just over $26. That's a burger with no side. When I paid I turned to my wife and said this better be the best burger we've ever eaten. Well, I hate to report it was NOT. The only condiment was catsup, there was one tiny piece of romaine lettuce, a tomato with the hard green center still in tact with a thick slice of onion. On the side there was a very wilted pickle spear that looked like it had been left out to dry. The bun was so dry it literally crumbled in my hands as I tried to eat it (see picture). I love to support local small businesses and am not a negative reviewer at all. I am always quick to leave a great review when I have a good dining experience. This wasn't the case here so I'm just calling it exactly how it was. If you want to trust the 4.5 stars go right ahead I did."}
{"text":"I decided to give Fa-me a second tried and boy was I impressed! First time I went was on opening day so I think I should have cut them more slack (sorry Fa-me). My main complaint was the ingredients. This time i could taste the freshness and quality of their ingridients, from the eggs to the coffee, veggies etc. i will definitely be a regular here. I normally don't go out for breakfast because i had not found a restaurant that makes delicious breakfast with the same quality of ingredients I use at home. I guess I will be spending less time in the kitchen on the weekends."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place! It's great for a coffee and danish on-the-go or for the leisurely weekend brunch. The food is incredible! Their lattes are deliciously flavorful without being too sweet. I would recommend the veggie omelet for a light/savory breakfast and the pancakes for something sweet! Don't pass up their fresh squeezed juice!"}
{"text":"Repeat visit for my wife and me.  The first couple of visits the food and service were spot on; perhaps it's just an off day for the chef but the eggs were awful!  I ordered the breakfast wrap which was fairly decent and my wife ordered the veggie omelet which looked and tasted like something pre-made and warmed up in the microwave.  The \"eggs\" were draped on top of cold veggies...for $30 (for 2) we expected better.  The 2 stars are for the great servers who are always friendly."}
{"text":"This place is highly on my list to recommend to the locals or visitors. Good food, coffee, and chick spot to hang out with (small group) friends or just yourself go sip coffee and watching the world (on your PC) or blending in...lovely place. Breakfast (so far) has been delicious (slightly more of the cost, but I would want to go here) and worth your spending. This is my new favorite place currently. You should try it out!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here for breakfast this morning, and it was incredible!  I had the Croque Madam, and it was the best I've ever had...and I've been to France!  The bread was so cheesy and delicious, but not so toasty that it cuts your mouth like a lot of Croques I've had.  The egg was cooked perfectly, the ham was delicious and not too salty, and they didn't add anything ridiculous like mustard, as I've run into other places.  My friend had the steak sandwich, and it was great too.  The steak was cooked perfectly and not at all tough.  I also ordered a side of potatoes, which weren't anything to write home about, but my Croque more than made up for that!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Burrito was a bit hard. I was waiting until they worked out all the issues I read about. My daughter was insistent on trying out this place, and now she understands my position. I honestly could have made a burrito better at home. The tortilla was hard and it was a bit dry on the inside. Loved the orange juice and my daughter enjoyed the apple juice. I would probably wait for more time to pass to give it another try"}
{"text":"After almost being bit by a rattlesnake on our morning hike, there is no better way to eradicate the fear than to have some pancakes, and famé has the best. This is our second Sunday in a row having brunch here and although new, they seem to have it figured out."}
{"text":"I've been back several times since my first visit, and thank goodness the service has improved. I would like to give the restaurant four stars, but I will leave the review at only 3 because two things bother me. 1. It's higher priced, and 2. Short hours  Gratefully, the staff has adapted a good routine for handling the morning crowd. Every time I go, several people are waiting for service. Some customers are couples who go to Fame to sit and enjoy a nice brekkie. I always feel like the only one in a hurry.   The fresh juices are good and the pastries look delicious. I think I tried the banana bread and something lemony. I was happy to find them moist, but not oily.    -------  I'm not considering my second visit to Fame in the review, but I just have to mention it because it's funny.  On a particular morning, I was the first folk there. I ordered and then held out cash to pay, but was told that cash orders couldn't be taken for another half hour or so. OoHHH. Did someone forget to fill the CASH register?  Like I said, I'm always in a hurry, so there was no way I was going to wait around. Leaving  empty handed felt so weird and rejected-like, though. Two hours later, I burst out laughing because I was thinking: my change would have only been $3. Between all of the staff, they couldn't reach in their pockets and make petty cash/change? What a chuckle that was."}
{"text":"I have been to this cafe a few times but I had not been in a while. Yesterday I stopped in for brunch. My daughter ordered blueberry muffin and an omelet which came with potatoes. She thought her muffin and potatoes were really good and her omelet was not amazing but good. I ordered one pancake, an egg and fried cauliflower. Oh Yea and a latte. Latte was great, cauliflower was good it was different than when I ordered it before. I think it was deep fried before and this was a bit different but good. My pancake was not cooked all the way through so I had to send it back...probably didn't need it. What was AMAZING was how much effort the owner gave to me for my pancake being wrong. She was so nice and so concerned and tried over the top to make our experience great which honestly is more important than the food. She even refunded my money you can just tell that she cared so much about your experience and this was awesome and will be what would bring me back again and again."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood MUST!! Lines can be long on weekends but worth the wait. The quality of food is amazing, the preparation of it, equally amazing! Basic menu, which is ideal for the farmhouse/warehouse interior decor. The staff (always busy) super friendly & polite.. I have been several times & look forward to many more meals here!!!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch on Father's day. My first time, I loved it. Place has a really good urban coffee shop/bistro vibe. Good was excellent. Staff friendly and attentive. Noise level not bad considering how busy it was. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Dear Fáme Cafe, I want to sincerely thank you for existing. We have ran to you four times now for weekend breakfast and never been disappointed Your croque madame truly satisfied my intense Saturday morning need for something rich and delicious. The cappuccino alongside was so smooth and yummy too. The only thing better may be your fresh orange juice. The ham used in the croque and in the HBLT was so good I'm confident you roast and slice it in-house.  And, your homemade pickle was so sweet, how'd you do that?!?! Mmmmm, thank you for being so wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great service (smiles and conversation) and delicious food. The organic coffee was on point too :) and the oatmeal was to die for, I don't usually say that about oatmeal."}
{"text":"We went here yesterday around 11am. The line wasn't too long and it went quick. We sat outside and the misters were on so it was cool and comfortable. Service was quick and the staff were friendly and efficient.   The reason for only three stars is, the food was just meh. Not awful, but just nothing special and not too flavorful. Husband got the breakfast sandwich without cheese or meat; added avocado. I had the avocado toast; added tomatoes and egg. I had asked for an egg with the white cooked and the yellow runny. The girl taking my order said, \"Oh, that's our over medium.\" Unfortunately it was over cooked; the yolk was not runny. Disappointing.  We shared the potatoes and they were delicious.  We also bought slices of banana bread and ate it this morning at home. It was very good.   This was our second time here; we ordered something different last time and it was just okay also. We will continue looking for a favorite breakfast restaurant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and unique concept. Menu is fresh and good. Biggest disappointment is in the staff training and service. Lack of any energy, enthusiasm or most importantly eye contact.  Cashier was very robotic and unfriendly. Bartender looked everywhere but in front of him and any potential guests in need."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for brunch after an event across the street. For a Sunday morning, this place seemed pretty empty (after reading other reviews here, I'm now realizing we got lucky that day). This place is SO cute! It's along Central Ave. near a bunch of other restaurants. I got the Fame Omelette, which I thought was decent, but not great. My friend got the breakfast wrap. For my drink, I got the iced mocha and it was pretty standard.   I liked the vibe here very much! I wasn't impressed with the food the first time around, but I plan to come back and try something else. The atmosphere and service were good enough for me to want to try this place again."}
{"text":"Parking: Eyyyyy not so bad, plenty of parking. In the hope your kids do not read the sign of those special kakes next door out loud...lol  Entrance: I notice they have tables and chairs outside, along side with a couple of doggie water bowls. Assuming, its \"Pet Friendly\" makes it a homie place to grab a bite to eat.  Inside the restaurant:  We walk in and there's not much to know whether someone is going to seat you or you seat yourself until you stand for a moment watching others. The ahh hah light bulb comes in and you notice you order your food, take a number, and have a seat. Off to the right, you'll notice the different types of coffee on the menu and in the middle there is a cash register. Behind the cash register at the top of the wall is the food menu.   The Food: I order the Croquet Monsieur and the Mocha Iced Coffee. It didn't take too long for our order to come out. The aged cheddar that the menu claims this good Croquet has, is what drew me to order it. As it sat on my table I tried to determine whether I had an omelet or a melted cheddar covered sandwich. Well it was the sandwich with flavorful cheese and ham melted inside. I never had one but I have to say I loved every bite of it. I noticed a side of greens to it and decide to dip into that with a fork. Had a bit of a salt flavor with some kind of Italian or vinaigrette dressing. I'm not a fan of salads but I ate it all. Sisters boyfriend asked if I'd like to try some of the french toast he ordered. Well that was a shocker, I tried it, seem to be a possible normal french toast, except that citrus flavor came out. I would have never thought the two would work, but wow, that was good. I'll have to get that next time. Good job whoever invented that one.  The Ending and Why not a 5: They do have waiters come around from time to time to see if anything else is needed, so they don't just leave you to the tables, don't worry. I would have given it a full 5 but it's not a location near me. Also, the food is excellent but it's something I would have to of grown up on. If it was chicken fried stick and eggs, would go back more than once a month. This could be a new entry for breakfast for me, maybe at some point it could hit the home cooking gut and make a 5. Keep up the excellent above average service and food, you guys are bringing something very different to the breakfast table. Everyone can appreciate that."}
{"text":"Came back to give Fame another try, now that it's well and open! It's still as lovely looking and I still gravitate to their open patio/bar seating.  Decided I wanted breakfast for lunch (breakfast served all day) and got pancakes, side of sausage and a small iced latte. Though price point is a bit steep here, the quality of food and service is spot on. The pancakes were perfect and my ideal pancake! Three, thick, fluffy with a slight crisp edge and a lovely buttery flavor. Served with maple syrup and of course I got a little more butter on the side. I did not find the sausage to be fitting for the price $3 for a sausage link cut in half, it was definitely different from a typical uncased breakfast sausage and more akin to a Chinese Sausage in texture and milder in flavor. The latte was pretty good as well.  Service here makes you feel appreciated and welcome with constant checking in and greetings. Great food and solid coffee! I'm kicking myself because I want to try more of their breakfast menu, definitely drawn in at this point. Plus, for them to understand that breakfast any time of day is appropriate are people who know what they're doing! Haha! They serve more than just breakfast, they serve sandwiches, juices, pastries and coffee. Wi-Fi is decent here and outlets are located along the perimeter of the cafe except for at the patio/bar area. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Love!!!  Had the fame omelet and it was extra delicious. Great atmosphere and very nice ladies behind the counter. They seemed genuinely nice, not just the nice because they have to be. I loved that. This could very well be my new favorite stop for breakfast, coffee, and laptop time. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We loved our food! I ordered the chilaquiles special and it was delicious! The environment was great, it was so nice and cute in there. Plus the cashier at the time was extremely nice and helpful since we were first timers. Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend after hiking on a Sunday.  We got a spot at the long talk table outside.  The egg white omelette was very clean, and came with fruit.  Such a cute place, affordable and good food.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The build out for this caffe was done beautifully. The owners clearly care about us locals and utilize all locally sourced ingredients possible. The food consistency has improved tremendously since they've opened and the staff is usually very friendly. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, the seating is superior to many downtown joints and feels more European than hipster. The espresso took me back to France - excellent! Omelette was ok. They do not have a good decaf yet, which is negative because my wife prefers not to have caffeine. You also have to ask for Splenda- they only have that bitter Stevia junk as they are wholistic/ organic. They were making some good looking juices fresh also."}
{"text":"Great food but they adjusted the tip I put on my card. My food came out to $11.35 I wrote down a 2 dollar tip and they made it to 6 dollar tip. Not cool!"}
{"text":"New favorite for breakfast. I'm big on friendly staff.. these folks are endearing. And a spinach and greyere omlette they just nailed. Love high quality bacon and found it plated here too. Just a fantastic, beautiful spot! Eat here.. let's make it relly popular!"}
{"text":"Delicious soy chai tea latte iced. Cute little spot in uptown Phoenix. Went here to go to breakfast with a friend, and wound up really enjoying it! Had the breakfast wrap with chorizo and really liked it. May have had too much potato, but overall really tasty. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend and would come back!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance and the setting that this venue sets out to its diners. You order at the counter, grab a number, and your food is brought out to you. Came in on a Friday morning for a late brunch with some friends in town. I ordered the breakfast sandwich as did one of my friends. My other friend had the breakfast tacos. The sandwich was delicious, however I'm not pro to cutting an avocado in half and plopping it onto the sandwich. It wasn't hard to slice my avo myself - just was surprised that this was a method people were using in the food business....  I stole a few bites of the breakfast tacos - now that's a damn good taco. The mashed potatoes were an interesting mix up. Would definitely order that next time!  The daily brewed coffee was good and their specialty drinks also look pretty awesome. This place has been on my list for awhile. I'm super glad I finally got to try it. There's tons on the menu I'd be happy to devour! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"What a great place! The pancakes and bacon are phenomenal! It's like they chose a pig from heaven and placed it on my plate! Delicious! I have also had the parfait with a side of toast when I am not as hungry. Always fresh fruit. Great service and quality product, a staple of my weekend breakfast."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here when I was visiting for a business trip. Yelp showed me the way. Was it everything I had hoped for? no... it was much more. I got the chilaquiles with a side of a French toast slice. I also got a latte. I was in heaven. I wanted to eat everything but to my dismay, my stomach was at full capacity. The people were so nice! They even have their own house made Cholula type of hot sauce. I will certainly return when I come back to PHX."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and loved it! Everything from the salads to the desserts are homemade. The coffee and iced tea were amazing.  Great farm to table restaurant."}
{"text":"Great envirnoment! Farm style meets industrial with a taste of mexico! Their Chilaquiles are to die for.  Highly recommend them for a family, business or even study session."}
{"text":"Fun find! Delicious breakfast-had the Parisian crepe and it was yummy and healthy -watch a great match!    Seating is communal and casual, felt cozy and independent at same time. Nice size space and interior. Staff was friendly and cheerful. Restroom was very clean and private.   I went early, 8am on a Sat and since it's self seating and lots of space I didn't feel like I was holding up a table too long while I wrote out some postcards.   Was a perfect beginning to my day"}
{"text":"Where rustic meets hipster, you'll find a chill atmosphere surrounding your fantastic eats. A walk-up order venue which offers breakfast and lunch options. We visited on a Saturday at about 10:30am. No outrageous wait to order, and our food came out quickly. We ordered the Veggie Scrambler and the Breakfast wrap (see pictures), which were both very good. The Veggie scrambler also came with red roasted potatoes which were sprinkled with a hit of rosemary. Nice touch! We ordered jam for the bread, which was strawberry. Not sure if it was homemade or not, but that was also good. A vanilla latte to drink was added to our order, which totaled a very reasonable $23. All and all, this place is a solid recommendation. Perfect for a date, catching up with a friend, or solo people watching and decor gazing."}
{"text":"Consistent, great food and amazing service. While standing in line (when it's busy) they give you a number and then place the number on a table so after you order you have a place to sit. You order at a counter, and on less busy days you just seat yourself. My boyfriend and I ride our bikes here when it's cooler as they have bike locks just right outside. It's dog friendly so you'll also see many pets on the patio. The only down side is that the patio is very narrow so I feel there is not much room in between tables, and no room for more then two people to a table. We have had the French toast, pancakes, burritos, cinnamon rolls and eggs bene special. Everything is so good! This is a weekly spot for us!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! the food was amazing! we got pancakes with scrambled eggs, steel cut oats, and the avocado toast (which is to die for!!) the freshly squeezed orange juice tasted so delicious but the iced latte could have been a little sweeter. other than that would 100% recommend. must try!!!"}
{"text":"This place is WONDERFUL! The food is EXCELLENT! The atmosphere is lively but nice for breakfast and brunch. I've come in the last 2 days to eat and wait for my fur babies to be groomed across the street.  The service is WONDERFUL and did I day the food is EXCELLENT!? The location is good too, there's lots of free parking. It's right across from the Catholic church/school, the block before Camelback/N. Central."}
{"text":"Found this place on the way back to our hotel by downtown Phoenix. Really cute and quaint breakfast and lunch spot, love the decor and ambiance of the place. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The food was great, I ordered the breakfast wrap and my husband got the fàme omelette with fresh squeezed OJ and an iced vanilla latte. Everything was delicious, one of the best OJs we've ever had. Great place for a breakfast meetup, sol as we found it on our vacation here!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and both times I have loved it! First time was just a for a quick coffee on their very cute open patio/bar area (which is dog friendly, they even have water bowls out for them). The restaurant has a cute farm to table ambiance. The egg cartons on the ceiling are a great conversation starter!  Second time was for brunch on a Sunday. The parking lot was a little full, luckily the restaurant was busy but not too busy. We had to wait in line to order but we found a table without any issues. Service is fantastic and prompt. And food is delicious! This visit I had the huevos rancheros (which I have never had before), they were very good but I didn't have anything to compare them to. We ordered Flat Whites to drink (which weren't on their menu) and they completely accommodated us.   I can't wait to come back to try some of the other items on the menu (looking at you parisian omelette) and bring my dog."}
{"text":"Incredibly good food and a refreshing vibe. Local, fresh ingredients and a menu that combines \"familiar\" with \"exotic\" - this is the type of place that you might find in Paris or Buenos Aires that locals adore. The owners were out mingling with the customers and were genuinely interested in their clientele. It's a breakfast / brunch spot - so it is only open a few hours a day & fills up quickly."}
{"text":"it hurts my feelings to write a bad review, but.... i went in last week with my mom for breakfast and we were pretty excited.  even for how busy it was, there was plenty of parking, the place is adorable, and the staff are very friendly.  so what could possibly go wrong?  twice?  well, the burger.  they ask how you would like it cooked, which leads me to believe i get to choose my own adventure in doneness, but thats a big lie.  i said rare and was given a well done burger.  i want red, i got black.  ok, no big deal, i went up and asked for a replacement and they didnt give me an ounce of attitude or hassle, and the owner even came over and personally apologized.  they went through such great lengths, i just felt like an asshole.  it was a good burger, i could have choked it down and not made anyone uncomfortable.  the next burger comes out after a 10 minute tableside dissertation about the quality of their meat and yadda yadda, which we endured, but as soon as burger 2 appears, the tumbleweed appeared and suddenly no one cared.  probably because this was also overcooked completely through.  so i payed for 1 burger, received 2, and ate 0. i think with a little fine tuning, this place could pull a few more stars from me, it has a lot of nice things going for it, but when a person places an order for a specific meat cook, they should get it, especially the second time.  the cook should be able to accomplish this, the server should check it before bringing the order out, and the second time, when the corrected version is supposed to be delivered, the management should double check it. it will be a while before i think i will find myself there again, but i surely will be back, hopefully to update my rating to a better one. (side note, the pickles are gross.  but thats just my opinion)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Perfect coffee and absolutely the nicest staff! Omelettes are spot on! The French toast looked amazing but I wasn't as impressed.  Oatmeal is awesome also.  Could sit and enjoy for Hours! I like the location next to the light railway."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite brunch places in Phx!  I made plans with a friend for brunch (obviously) and picked this place out after checking out the menu and seeing the reviews. Definitely didn't disappoint! I had the Croque Madame and one of their specialty coffee drinks and was blown away. My friend got the buffalo chicken sandwich and House-made chips (I stole handfuls of the chips). The spot is super cute. You go up to a counter, order, and pick a spot to sit. So it's super quick and easy. The workers are super sweet and terribly good at their jobs. Don't forget to try their house hot sauce!"}
{"text":"I really love stopping here. It's comfortable enough to sit at for a while if you have a coffee or have a meal. Food is always amazing and fresh. Wish it was open past three for so dinner!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place...the welcoming decor, the delicious coffee and the perfect portions of farm fresh food. Fresh squeezed juice, Schreiner's sausage and an atmosphere that could keep you there for hours. So happy to have this little gem in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Trendy place. Excellent customer service. Ordered frenchie toast $8.50 and coffee. Not typical French toast. Order is 4 pieces.  Taste is ok. In my opinion not worth $8.50. Good strong coffee!"}
{"text":"Just go. Oh and order the french toast when you get there. Well priced, friendly staff, great food. Really this place is a no brainer. Seriously though, best french toast in phoenix."}
{"text":"Lové Fàme, they have a fresh rotating menu...the environment is clean it is a great place to linger in..."}
{"text":"I was back in Phoenix on vacation and decided to stop in. It's right off the light rail which is a plus. I sat at the bar but you order first then grab a seat inside or outside. I opted for a Mimosa and the French toast and sausage. Definitely farm to table is correct. A generous portion of French toast, with fresh berries and delicious syrup. The sausage was in a nice casing that popped when you cut into it.  The Mimosa was great accompaniment to the meal.  Great customer service and prices that can't beat."}
{"text":"The essence of brunch is rooted in relaxation and escape, you've worked long all week and you just need to, as Tom Haverford and Donna would say on Parks and Rec: \"Treat yo self\". But recently brunch has become a fight-for-your-right to that semi-early escape - becoming a stressor in itself, waiting anxiously and impatiently (sometimes, if not always, in the heat) for delicious food. Fame can be brunch without the drama.  I walked right up to a counter, ordered the Croque Madam, and after a reasonable amount of time, enjoyed my ham-gouda-sunny side up sandwich with the breeze of the rare and coveted 75 degree weather in my face. My only complaint was the gouda was slightly burnt and the prices are a bit high but paired with the delicious Toddy iced coffee, I didn't mind too much.  I've always passed Fame because it is within walking distance of Lux, a nearby cafe that's a popular spot to work and hang out; with a crowded hipster vibe I try to frequent it on an as-needed basis only. By contrast, Fame is a nice alternative, it seeks to provide a relaxed yet sophisticated atmosphere where you can enjoy good food and drinks without the worry. Could this be a Phoenix cafe rivalry in the making? Oh yeah!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The croque madame is the best I've had anywhere. Excellent huevos rancheros, omelette, parfait, and outstanding French toast. Basically, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place is adorable and in a trendy part of town. It was so busy but we still were able to get a seat and our food came out much faster than expected! The eggs benny was delicious and I loved the cold brew! I will be back to try lunch next time."}
{"text":"Darn. Initially very impressed. Great space. Friendly staff. Decent coffee. Great fresh menu. No wifi. The barista even admitted that the wifi doesn't work.   Fix your wifi and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Fun place to go to for a quick breakfast and lunch if you are in the area.  Very chill place where you order in line and then take your number and they bring you your dish.  They serve many breakfast items many of which are vegetarian but only a few vegan choices unless you have them modify.  I at first was interested in their lunch special but you can't order that until 11 am so since I was there at 9 am decided to go for the avocado toast and a side salad. The service here is very friendly, they are helpful to let you know what the dishes have in them and will modify any dish to your desires. The place is situated with a very large kind of farm style table with a bunch of smaller tables surrounding the place.  Orders come out quickly.  The avo toast was excellent and filling.  They put a spice on top of the avocado which is tasty.  The salad was fresh and good but it was lacking dressing so I asked for more.  It actually worked well to order both dishes because you could take some avocado from the toast and put it on top of the salad.  Both dishes were filling enough but I had a juice before so I was not super hungry.  Overall I would like to come back here again and try lunch but in general it's a great option if you are looking for something healthy and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Good food, however 2 of the 3 items were half the size of what they should be and they charge for every little thing. Unless you want ketchup or hot sauce you'll probably be charged."}
{"text":"First time here. Checked it out after hearing good things. Was not impressed and very disappointed. They were out of French toast, oatmeal and biscuits and gravy. The things I heard such good things about. Why don't we order enough product to cover the demand, especially if it's a popular item. I found it to be very overpriced for what you get. I ordered a BLT and a iced coffee, $14!!. My friend I was with ordered the breakfast sandwich. The way they were prepared made it almost impossible to eat. The breakfast sandwich falls apart in the first bite with how they layered the items and the bread used for the BLT is so hard and the bacon not evenly placed it punctures the bread and mayo goes everywhere. Not happy at all. Would try it again but hope for a better experience."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it's a great little breakfast cafe! The food is delicious- I highly recommend the Croque Madame (with one sunny side up egg on top) or the Croque Monsieur (without egg), it's kind of heavy but incredible good! The line moves quickly there, so your never waiting to long and the ladies who take your order are always pleasant. My one and only crux with this spot is that their coffee is constantly out. They keep it in a self pour container, which for obvious reason, runs out quickly with the volume of people who come through. The fact that they are always  'borderline' out of coffee as a breakfast cafe is just... well, kind of ridiculous. Other then that the food is so good, atmosphere so pleasing and service so pleasant that you can overlook the coffee goofiness. However, all and all, I'm very happy and will continue to visit this place time and time again!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little gem of a breakfast/brunch/lunch cafe. Beautiful potted flowers and herbs on patio and very relaxed and friendly atmosphere. If you are looking for good organic fresh foods this is the place. Downtown Phoenix centrally located right next to light rail."}
{"text":"I came here for some breakfast on a Sunday.  It looked like a good place to try so I came in.  Not being able to eat wheat there is a limited menu but I settled on the Quiche with fruit and an Americano.  The Americano was decent but not as good as my little espresso maker can make at home which I had one earlier.  The Quiche was also pretty good but I could tell it was not baked that day because it was served ice-box cold!  It looks like, for the most part this place is all about freshness and quality.  They even have organic coffee.  If the quiche had been baked that day I don't think they would have needed to store it in the refrigerator.   It was pretty good cold, I imagine it would be great warm.   The fruit was fresh and I'm glad that was cold!  The rest of the food that went by looked really good.  Too bad I can't eat bread because there were a few things I would try here!  Overall cute place and I would come back here again.  I see they have some draft beers here and grass-fed angus burger."}
{"text":"This has Been my weekend spot with the family for the past couple of months.  Freshly made every time! Friendly staff, go early if you want to beat the long lines. Recommend the Madame w/ egg and their freshly squeezed OJ! Remember closed on Mondays and close at 3pm."}
{"text":"This place is literally 2.3 seconds away from my house. I'm so glad that this place is open at 7am so my mom and I can have breakfast together and make it on time to work.   I Love the decor. Love the atmosphere and everything about this place. Look up at the ceiling. Hehe super cute.  The owner here is very nice. Very accommodating. And was very welcoming. I had the pancakes, fruits and potatoes on the side. And my mom had the eggs, sausage and potatoes. Our breakfast was wonderful. Except the potatoes, it was hard. So we took it back. Instead of getting new potatoes. They reimbursed our money back. Which wasn't what I asked for, the owner and I fight back and forth. He is just too kind. Great customer service!!   I'll be back  :D"}
{"text":"Sitting inside, at bar and on patio. Walk up to place food order and they will deliver to your table. I had the Frenchie Toast. It was made on a baguette type of bread with berries and powder sugar. YUM. Can't wait to go back and try another menu item."}
{"text":"I met up with a friend here and it was the perfect place to catch up. Because you order at the counter, that meant we weren't constantly interrupted by a waiter. My friend was a vegetarian and the menu had enough variety to satisfy us both.   I ordered the pork belly wrap, which was the special of the day, and it was amazing! The portion was huge and I was only able to finish half of the wrap. My friend got the pancakes and was also unable to finish all of it.   We both enjoyed the ambiance, the quality of the service, and the quality of the food. This spot was recommended by a friend who lives close by and I'm so glad she did."}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast/brunch spot.  The organic coffee is delicious, croque madame was right on the spot.. and must save room for the frenchie toast (I added berries) ... the customer service is outstanding.. seriously and excellent spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Somewhat hefty prices for the amount you get but it's worth it. Monte Cristo is delicious here; it's only served on weekends. Parking tends to fill up pretty quickly and it's hard to turn onto central with it being on the corner so come prepared to walk.   Overall great food and atmosphere and always worth the trip."}
{"text":"Incredible. Absolutely incredible. I got a mocha, fresh squeezed oj, and a breakfast burrito with bacon instead of chorizo. Everything was fresh and tasted heavenly. Perhaps the best breakfast burrito I've ever had, especially with the green salsa they serve it with.  I've driven by hundreds if times and had never stopped...I will be stopping now!"}
{"text":"Food was great but will not fill you up as normally most places that charge $9.99 for breakfast should. The girl at the register did not care for our experience there and made it obvious that she was annoyed or hungover working there on a Sunday morning. The atmosphere and environment of the place is very nice as most places on central are but don't go if you have a big appetite or want good customer service"}
{"text":"I had read an article or 2 about this place. Our food came out quickly. The chicken pesto sandwich was great. Fried cauliflower for a side was a way better sub than the standard fruit or salad. Flavored tea complimented the meal and even went well with the brownie that the owner brought me for my birthday. She was really sweet and made sure we were happy."}
{"text":"I had a craving for French toast, the frenchie toast which is French toast consisting of berries was good. The place is pet friendly and has a warm feeling to the place. Overall and enjoyable experience for breakfast."}
{"text":"Here's the deal..... I love a good egg sandwich...it may be my most favorite food....The first time I got the egg sandwich here, I messed up. They serve it on a brioche bun, which, for me, is way too much bread and messes with the flavor of the sandwich. On subsequent visits, I got my sammie with an over easy egg and various types of toast....MUCH better. Also, last time I went, they threw on some avocado.... even better! Prices are decent, portions are large, and the coffee is good. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Fàme Cafe is a great place for breakfast or lunch. The vibe is laid back and everyone who works there is helpful and friendly. I teach, perform, and work across the street at The Torch Theatre and it's awesome to have a place within very close walking distance to grab coffee or a bite.  It's hard to recommend one single item when they do so much, so well. Their breakfast sandwich and their breakfast wrap are both wonderful and hearty. Basically, though, it's just quality ingredients, prepared well, and at a good price. Good times!  Even if you just need coffee and a place for free wifi or to read a newspaper, it's a pretty calm place to hang out.   If you haven't been to Fàme Cafe before, you should! If you've already been, I'm sure you'll visit soon."}
{"text":"Overrated. The \"breakfast wrap\" AHEM aka breakfast burrito was really bland. The potatoes inside were slightly undercooked and the reddest grease I've ever seen was everywhere. The burrito, sorry.....breakfast wrap...fell apart, which is always annoying getting all those ingredients on your hands; especially the grease.  $8+ for a glorified breakfast burrito, that is not executed well, is lame.   The chai was average. If you love chai, checkout the Refuge Cafe not too far away."}
{"text":"Great place! Avocado toast was excellent! Croque Madame was also divine! Great atmosphere! Cool decor! Very welcoming. The staff was upbeat and friendly! Is a bit pricey, but the quality is superb! My new spot!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Went for lunch with coworkers during the week, I had chicken enchiladas, they had quiche and the vegetable enchiladas. Environment and presentation was excellent. Food was pretty good i have had better enchiladas but these were still good. Pineapple mint lemonade is addictive and I'll be going back for that alone (it's very sweet though so caution to those who don't have much of a sweet tooth)"}
{"text":"Sooooo delicious!! Everything is made from scratch, and it reflects in the food. My daughter had the buttermilk pancakes, and said they were some of the best she's ever had. I had the croque Monsieur, and OH WOW!!!! And on top of that, their cold brew coffee was one of my top give favorites of all time!! And the staff just rounded out the experience by being super friendly and accommodating. We will be going back and SOON!!"}
{"text":"Well all my food came out cold, the line was super long so not worth trying to get it fixed and then waiting another 15 minutes. The apple juice was super good and the coffee was pretty good. Service at the counter was also pretty good. Just seems like maybe they could do somethings better. I might try this place again and hopefully it will be hot food next time."}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast. Great atmosphere! Good food - had Parisian omelette and quiche. Just a bit loud, but definitely not as loud or crowded as the coffee shop down the street."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in on a Saturday around noon. I thought it would be packed with a brunch crowd, but it wasn't. Everyone who wasn't there was missing out, though, because it was delicious, fast, and all around great. I had the chilaquiles and my boyfriend had a benedict special. We both loved our meals. I had a horchata latte and he had a mimosa. The latte was so incredible, and unique. The atmosphere is great. The service was friendly and FAST. We had been putting off trying this place since it opened because it initially had bad reviews. We are so glad we decided to try it. I just wish we hadn't waited so long."}
{"text":"My neighborhood cafe. I'm here 3-5 times a week. Always spotless service and facility and amazing food. There isn't a thing on the menu I don't love.  I do wish the ice-tea was a little more brutal. It's fairly tame. I want a very dark and strong ice tea but that's just me."}
{"text":"This place got a complete 180 makeover from the last coffee joint.   The food is fabulous and the fresh squeezed orange juice is to die for! The Carmel latte with a dust of cinnamon on top is a must try.  The fresh squeezed orange juice perfect.  It is very smooth, sweet but not too sweet."}
{"text":"I've only had the pleasure of trying their coffee, but as amazing as my latte was, I'm sure I will have to be back to try their food. I ordered an almond milk latte and it was delicious. You would think that it's simple enough, but usually with non-dairy lattes, they can be pretty hit or miss. This one was great. The espresso had a nice flavor and which ever almond milk they used, it was so tasty. A hit! Also, the wait wasn't long at all. I went in on a Wednesday around 7am. The café is a good size and has a good, cozy feeling to it."}
{"text":"The iced coffee is one of the best I've had in Central Phoenix. After living in Australia for a few years and moving to PHX, I was missing the smooth creamy coffees I had in Aus. Fame delivers. The oatmeal is also great! Not too sweet, and the nuts and berries are a perfect texture mix."}
{"text":"I went here by accident and was extremely happy! The menu is all organic, locally sourced and there are vegan and vegetarian options. The food was very well priced and the portions were very large. I ordered the vegan quinoa bowl and it was amazing. I could not believe how well the food was prepared and tasted.   The service is quick and great! Our food was out in about 10 minutes after ordering. After our meal the owner stopped over and asked about our dining experience. She explained the restaurants concept and idea and thanked us for stopping by. As a nice surprise she brought over some banana nut bread to dip in my coffee.   I will be back! What a great little spot."}
{"text":"I really liked the eggs benedict we ordered here!  I also enjoyed the side of potatoes it came with.  The pancakes were also good, but didn't notice anything incredible about them.  They are served with a side of maple syrup and they charge you like a $1 for more syrup, which is pretty annoying.  Especially because you pay at the counter before you get your food, so you have to get a whole separate tab just for some more dang syrup!  I didn't need more syrup for my pancakes, but my friend did.  I got the lemonade (it was actually limeade) and that was good too.  We really liked the decor of this place and on a Sunday morning parking was actually easy to find, though I imagine that lot can sometimes get filled up."}
{"text":"Great food, even better coffee.  We've been here 3 times. The third time, my coffee was (misplaced? made and handed to someone else? Not sure). When I inquired about the coffee, they made sure it was at my table ASAP. Someone came over to apologize and offered me a mimosa on the house (I declined, but next time YAASSS) for the hiccup. So nice of them!   Sometimes it gets crowded and loud, as it is a smaller place, and there's not a ton of parking.   The same girl (Stephanie, maybe?) is usually on the register and is quick, efficient and accurate. Super friendly and always greets us with a smile."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwiches were extremely disappointing. We tried one with avocado and one with bacon. On both, the eggs were overcooked and dry, the brioche bun tasted old and dry, and barely any cheese. At least the ambiance is nice and coffee good. Maybe the other menu items are better?"}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with the staff here. Everyone was incredibly friendly and personable. Having a pretty sensitive diet has been difficult to deal with while both traveling and going out to eat. The two ladies that went through the entire menu with me this morning singlehandedly improved my trip to visit my family. I appreciate the time they took to help me find vegan breakfast options!   The food was fresh and very flavorful. The sautéed veggies I got were amazing and reminded me of the farm fresh dishes I make back home in Portland. My mom mentioned the French Toast being unique in an unexpected manner, but tasty nonetheless.   As far as the atmosphere goes, fantastic job guys. Such an adorable place. I'd definitely be a regular here if I still lived in the state."}
{"text":"Got the daily quiche and potatoes. My quiche was burnt, bland, and had a hair in it. Potatoes werent cooked all the way nor were they seasoned. Latte tasted terrible. My boyfriend had the dos, nothing was seasoned. High horchatta latte, tasted nothing like horchatta. Way over priced, we paid $50 some, and it was just two of us. Also my quiche had mushrooms when i asked for none, and my boyfriend asked for three eggs only got two. Terrible over priced breakfast."}
{"text":"Yet another central place that didn't let me down. Staff was friendly and fast. Although it was busy, my order was taken in no more than five minutes with various people in front of me and my order was handed to me fresh in about 10 minutes. The cashier was nice and helpful, the decor was mid century modern and cozy. This is good  place for brunch, and seems quite popular. I expected good food and got amazing food and service."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Brunch is fantastic and some of the best cold brew coffee around!"}
{"text":"Really great breakfast spot! Service is quick enough where you don't have to call ahead on the way to work. Prices are very reasonable for what you get. The staff is extremely friendly and always welcoming. I've been a few times already and this will be a nice new breakfast staple. Try the croque Monsieur!"}
{"text":"Food is well worth the money, cute vibe and opens at 7am which is great! The staff can be a little hit or miss except for the gal with the long red hair. I always forget her name because I'm terrible with names but she's AMAZING! Always friendly, great service and super organized!"}
{"text":"Coffee & food are excellent and would like to give a 5 star review, but the gal running the cash register was snarky when asked if they were going to unlock the doors anytime soon. Recommend you rethink making your customers wait outside in cold while you have a morning meeting that runs past opening."}
{"text":"One of my favorite early morning stops!  Nice selection of fresh made pastries.  Nice ambience. Had their yogurt parfait with yummy granola and honey, fresh berries.  It was excellent!  Don't forget to bring your dog. They have a small but dog friendly front patio."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Hipster chic. Barn wood/Pallet wall coverings. wrought iron. I like it...but it feels like this style is about to get dated. That doesn't bother me but Christine is always aware of a look that is about to die. It is definitely \"of the time\" but not especially creative.  Service: Wow! really really fast. Water is self serve (I can live with that). The silverware is in an enamel coated coffee cup with enough for a whole days worth of customers. This was fine by me but Christine said \"what if someone coughed on these\".   Food: Adequate. Not \"bad\". Just not anything special. The potatoes were bland. The omelette was uninspired (but an omelette is an omelette). Christine said her special order hot chocolate with a splash of regular (not espresso) was good. High praise from Christine.  Portions: No complaints. Good portion sizes  Price: Not crazy expensive but not cheap.   Other: It looks like this place might convert into a bar of sorts at night. Not sure, but there appears to be a full-ish looking bar behind the counter/bar where people are currently eating breakfast"}
{"text":"Excellent. Unique. Great food in a relaxed atmosphere. Order at the counter. Chilaquiles were amazing as was the sweet roll."}
{"text":"This place has a wonderful vibe. It looks as if Chip and Joanna Gaines had done the interior. The way they move people through is great. We went on a Sunday morning about 9:30. It was about 90% full but no one lined up to order. We went to the counter to order. I had the croque madame and my friend had the special Monte Cristo. Both were done perfect. The croque madame was very good, the egg done perfectly. For me there was too much ham, that is just me, not a complaint. It made it too rich.  When I go again, I may ask if it can be made with half the amount of ham. My friend loved the Monte Cristo. After we were there about 30 minutes there was a line of about 10 people or more to order and it stayed that way until we left about 11:30. Clearly very popular. I can see why as the food is good."}
{"text":"I came here last week after wanting to try it for a few months. The atmosphere was better than I had anticipated and the food was delicious. It's pretty cheap if you order off the standard menu, but I ordered breakfast enchiladas which were delicious. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Favorite new coffee joint - friendly atmosphere, great epicurean taste and breakfast menu, and amazing cappuccinos and prompt service. I had a dirty chai and vegetable quiche and it was probably the most flavorful quiche I have ever had. I'll go there again many times as it is a work-friendly environment, and I don't like the noise at Starbucks."}
