{"text":"Definitely my favorite meal prep company! HummusKing Meals offers delicious mediterranean food and is extremely convenient for a busy lifestyle. These meals make cutting calories and eating healthy enjoyable!"}
{"text":"The chicken kabob, beef and chicken shawarma are what I get every week. The best \"fit food\" I can find. I'm trying to eat cleaner and healthier to lose weight and these meals are wonderful for the on the go person like me. The meals are pre-packaged and portioned just right for you. I find healthy food sometimes is not so healthy or disgusting in taste but these meals are sooooo tasty but right in calories too! The service is great and not to mention delivery is the best thing EVER for me!!! Thank you HK1 for always getting my orders right!!!!"}
{"text":"When you talk about meals put together carefully with love and high quality taste, I think that explains this meal prep company. 

Healthy, delicious, and passionate. I love HK meals."}
{"text":"If you want a healthy choice that taste good, HK1 is the way to go. Fresh and healthy, they drop off twice a week. Thanks again Fouad and HK1 Meals!"}
{"text":"I'm giving a 2 star review because the food itself is not the issue.  If the food was bad, it would be a 1.  The food is actually good.  I've had a very difficult time dealing with the person on the other end.  

The first time I ordered we were missing a meal.  I called HK and the man who answered said he would bring it by the next day; that didn't happen.  We had to track him down and he brought it by later in the week and also threw in some peanut butter balls which were great.  So we decided to try him again and there was no issue.  We took a week off and ordered again for the week of 4/30.  I ordered 9 total meals:  the order included 6 chicken dishes, 2 beef, and 1 salmon dish.  The meals showed up yesterday and there were 9 meals, but all were beef.  I emailed and spoke with the man from HK right as he was leaving my house.  I noticed this within minutes.  I would have HAPPILY given these meals back as this was NOT what I ordered in the slightest.  I personally am trying not to eat red meat as my initial order of mostly chicken reflected.  I was told \"I will personally make your order myself.  Keep those meals.  I will bring your meals by either tonight or first thing tomorrow morning.\"  Needless to say he did not show up that evening, he did not show up the next morning, and he has not returned my calls, texts, emails or messages through Facebook.

I really want to give this person the benefit of the doubt, but I was over promised twice and in the second case grossly under delivered as I'm now left with meals that I'm not going to eat and I didn't order.  Great intentions, but poor follow through.  Had I not been burned multiple times, I'd give him a quality review, as again, the food itself is not the issue."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best meal prep anywhere! The food is so good you don't even know you're eating something that will help you lose weight and look great!! The customer service is amazing as well!!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. They are always appreciative of your business and have delicious food. Perfect for on the go, working moms like myself! Wishing Fouad much success!!"}
{"text":"Got my first batch of meals, and the food tastes great!  meal prep is difficult for me to keep up with due to the work/ school schedule so i appreciate the pricing and speediness of the prep. Also my homemade chicken always comes out dry. The chicken in these meals are very juicy and full of flavor. Will definitely continue to order!

EDIT: I tried the jalape√±o cilantro hummus after the review. It tastes amazing. I felt I definitely had to come back to mention that after trying it!"}
{"text":"This is genius! I used to hate eating healthy because it wasn't flavorful. Now with HK meals I can eat healthy and enjoy it. I love that I can customize my meals so I don't get board of the same thing everyday! And the free delivery makes my life so much easier! Also my best friends daughter loves this stuff."}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food, ever! Authentic definitely the real thing. But even if you feel like you might be ready for authentic Mediterranean food, their selection is broad enough for children/novice and those who might want to try something adventurous!"}
{"text":"Tried to inquire about a monthly meal plan they were offering. The food looks good. Seems healthy. Really annoys me that a company that is active on social media can't respond on social media.

Photo below was them Auto responding to my follow, then never responding to me basically telling them I want to purchase their product.

Don't want my money I guess, well here's a review for your customer service skills."}
{"text":"Best meal prep service in the valley I have been going to Phoenicia cafe for years now and their food has always been amazing. The reason why I say this is because the owner fouad cooks his meals there so it's just a piece of heaven. My favorite is the chicken kabob with broccoli and hummus."}
{"text":"Coolest service!! A nice man Answered all my questions through text (which is honestly my preferred way to communicate :D) gave me all the information to set up an account and pick my food. Then delivered the food to my house the very next day. The food is seriously soooo good! I have tried other meal services that were much more expensive and really tasted awful. HK meals is quick, reliable, healthy, and most importantly really delicious and very reasonably priced ! Super excited to continue business with them. This service will save me SO MUCH Time & energy. 10/10 recommended :)"}
{"text":"This meal prep service is amazing. The food is great quality and different from your normal meal prep stuff. But, the best thing is the customer service that the owner provides. He goes above and beyond to make sure you get your meals on time and also makes adjustments to the meals to meet your specific needs and wants. Highly recommended to anyone looking for meal prep!!"}
