{"text":"This place is bad. I ordered a simple breakfast burrito because they advertise \"wraps.\" The guy at the counter said they only do bagels so I said okay. He threw  1 slice of cheese and sausage and egg on it. I took 1 bite and it was cold and terrible. I went back because I was mad because he was rude and the sandwich was bad and told him to please remake it so he just threw it in the microwave for 30 seconds and tossed it on the counter.  I never post on Yelp but I was upset after this experience."}
{"text":"I always get grilled cheese and breakfast sandwiches from here. They make it as you ask and it's always pretty good."}
{"text":"My family loves coming here!  my husband loves the grilled cheese, he adds bacon and says it's the best sandwich ever. my four year old absolutely loves the ice cream and the flavor variety is great. I had them cater my daughters birthday party, my entire family was blown away. They did the cake plus cupcakes and a 3ft hoagie and I had no left overs which never happens. The cake was perfect exactly what my daughter wanted. Will definitely eat using them for my special occasion needs."}
{"text":"Bought an antipasto salad. It was huge for the price (7.50). Super generous with the meats. The Italian and the Ranch dressing are also excellent and I believe he said they were home made.  Looks like they have hoagies and pizza too."}
{"text":"Stoped here a few time for lunch over  the last couple months  or so . Everything has been pretty good and ready quickly. Which is a key thing for me due to I only get a 30 min lunch. There is no dining inside but they do have a few picnic tables out side .  I mainly just eat in the truck. Price is normally between $6 to $8  . They normally have 1 special a day and 1 soup and feature different deserts from time to time ."}
{"text":"Great location on the corner of Millers Run Rd and Battle Ridge Rd.  Their building is a repurposed filling station which makes parking super easy.  I have stopped here a few times for coffee to go on my way to work.  The coffee has been good each time, and today they had a Kenya medium roast which was just awesome.  This coffee needed no cream or sugar to taste good!  The service has always been quick, adding just a few minutes to my commute.  It takes longer than that just to park at a chain coffee location!  They also sell food (but I haven't tried it yet.)"}
{"text":"Nowhere to sit here, so I ordered a sandwich to go. The meatball sandwich only comes in one size, but it has plenty of meat, you won't be hungry. The ladies in the store were quite friendly, and they got my sandwich out very quickly. In addition, they make their own cupcakes, cannoli, and other temptations, I'll probably try them out soon."}
