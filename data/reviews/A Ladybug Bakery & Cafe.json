{"text":"Went here to grab a chocolate croissant as I heard the pastries were really good.  Way over priced and tiny.  The place is super busy though and I think it's only because there's a lack of choices up in Aspen/West Springs.  Saw the crepes but no way would I want to pay close to $15 for one."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER, DO NOT COME HERE. You can't sit down without an ordering number, you can't even wait for your friends to come first. 

The Owner came by while I was on the phone and my friend was in line to kick me out off the table and spoke very rudely and loudly such that other diners were looking at me; it was really embarrassing. She came over and yelled \"WHERE IS YOUR NUMBER?\" I said my friend is ordering, she responded with \"WHERE'S YOUR NUMBER? YOU CAN'T BE HERE WITHOUT A NUMBER, YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.\" All the while I was on the phone and she was just shouting in my other ear. I was more shocked than anything. 

This is NOT a cafeteria, what kind of system is this? It's definitely not cheap enough to tolerate terrible service; in fact, this place is outrageously overprice. $12 for an onion soup?"}
{"text":"I keep going back. It's good food but am going to say service needs to improve. The eclair is to die for!!"}
{"text":"If you like waiting forever for mediocre overpriced food than this is your place. Sure they make crepes, but they don't make them well. The coffee is superb, but you pay 3x the amount of that of Starbucks. Its merely a pretentious act in a pretentious neighborhood."}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is fresh, unique and numerous tasty items to choose from. I also like that they have pre-made items such as soup and cinnamon buns (take these home and say you made them;)). The ambience is very cozy and relaxed. The only thing I would agree with on some of the other reviews is it is a bit on the pricey side but well worth it."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was terrible, my husband and I went there for first  and definitely last time for breakfast, no one helped us, and we had to order and pay first and then sit, in the middle of our meal, we asked for more coffee, but the waiter said\" I have to ask the owner about your order\" so we left without finishing our breakfast. It was an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"It's a 5/5 for the products, but a 3/5 for the decoration and setting. I love the idea of a European style 'cafeteria', but when you enter the Aspen location, you don't know where to line up, where the menu is and where to pay. Very confusing. The decor- come on, you have to bin those plastic flowers!! While sitting at the table, I could see a thick dusting on the ledge..which otherwise would make me walk out immediately. But hey, the desserts are fantastic. Next time I might just take out rather than sitting in..."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a middle grade because there are a lot of pros and also quite a few cons. If Yelp gave me that option I'd actually give it a 3.5.

Pros - Quality food, friendly enthusiastic service, great tasting food, crisp clean feeling, excellent variety of sweet and savoury food as well as meals and snack sized bites, ample parking, great coffee and even better smoothies, and pleasant ambience. Their pastry display is mouthwateringly good and most items are available in individual sizes. 

Cons - Many items feel over priced, I don't need 100% organic so would rather pay a little less and get garden variety lettuce and tomatoes. They seem to reorganize their ordering system and table layout every month. I don't mind lining up to order because I get to look at items when I'm deciding which is nice. It's a bit annoying when it's busy and I've ordered and paid, but can't find a table. I wasn't a fan of the large shared tables they used to have and the tall bar height tables were a pain as the stools tipped so I slid off every time I sat on them. The smaller tables are a big improvement, but they are so tightly packed you need to be prepared for the lack of privacy when chatting. 

There are a few cons, but the pros certainly outweigh any negatives. All in all, it's a nice place. I enjoy dining at A Ladybug. I'm not exactly a regular, but have been there quite a few times. 

The smoked salmon crêpe has an interesting open faced twist and is fresh and light, it's one of my faves.  

They have the BEST pâté in the city!

I'd give it a 5 star rating if the prices weren't so high."}
{"text":"Can't believe how expensive it is here! So, so overpriced. And I shop regularly at patisseries and the farmers' markets, so I'm used to paying more for artisan quality. But wow. I had lunch at Rouge in Inglewood earlier today and paid less. 

Strange layout. Not sure where to order. Coffee is frothy and bitter. Staff are friendly but cannot speak English very well, so are unable to answer questions about the menu.  Strange furniture and decor. I'm confused about how they can charge so much for food and stay in business?"}
{"text":"Good food but worst customer service EVER from owner. I'll stick to Manuel Latruwe instead."}
{"text":"One of the best chicken soup that i've had in many years! And the Bennies and hash browns are 10/10!! Congratulations, amazing food, friendly staff, very good service! We recommend it to everyone that wants a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Since last visiting, the cafe is under new ownership and thank goodness for that! The vibe of the place has gotten much better and the staff are much more friendlier and accommodating! Food and drinks still taste the same - good and the atmosphere has changed for the better since under new ownership! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time yesterday morning and was really excited because the place looked cute and despite hearing that the owner is super rude, I wanted to give it a chance and it's close to my house. 

I walked in and immediately no one offered to help and i had to say \"excuse me\".  The owner was also there and was clearly agitated with her staff like I've heard. 

I started by asking if they have almond milk to make an almond milk latte. She said yes for 50 cents extra, so both my friend and I ordered one. When the total came up, it was almost $17, to which I asked if it was a mistake. She said no, and that it is $2.50 each extra for almond milk.  WHAT?????  So I'm paying over $8 for a medium almond milk latte? You could go next door to blush lane and get a carton of almond milk for $4, which is cheaper than paying for it at this place in my latte.  What the actual F***? 

After I was extremely shocked at the price, she just stood there and shrugged her shoulders.  I said that's absolutely ridiculous and if I could talk to a manager and she still just shrugged her shoulders and told the workers to hold on making the lattes.   

So I ended up walking out and going to Good Earth and the second i walked in there the girl said \"hi girls! You look so cute, what can I get you?\" I asked how much almond milk was and she said \"50 cents!\", then I told her about my experience at LadyBug and she told me she went there once and spent $20 on half a sandwich and a coffee. Ridiculous ..... 

I was hoping this place would be a lot friendlier and affordable but nope. if you want to spend $8.50 on a latte then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place - I really do! I've been three times and the food has been awesome; however, another espresso machine, and another barista is much needed.

I've been two times with my boyfriend - both times it took quite a while to get our coffees (over ten minutes). There was only work person working both times, and the second time I went he seemed quite busy - so that's fair game. 

Today I took my good friend there - raving about the dessert type breakfast. Which again, was awesome! We both ordered coffee - I ordered a whole milk latte, and she ordered a large french press coffee. We sat down and got our food a few minutes later... and we chatted and ate... we weren't quick eaters by any stretch of the imagination - but man. We were already done our food, the whole plate before we even got our coffees. They came at separate times too. I had my latte for a few minutes before she got her french press coffee.. We asked for to go cups as soon as they came... No apologies from staff for it. Totally disappointed because you have to tip in advance... I think next time I go, I won't order a coffee - and i'll leave the tip in cash on the table based on how it actually was, not how i hope it will be.

Seriously though, this cafe would be SOOOO much better if they had another barista and another espresso machine. They totally need it."}
{"text":"One of my best modern cafe and I would go here more often if it wasn't so far. The service is great, the staff are friendly and can assist in recommending dishes. I highly recommend eggs Benedict, but I mostly love all of their food. If you want something different, try their kimchi pasta or kimchi crepe. The pastries are also recommended."}
{"text":"I used to come here for years. The past months it hasn't been the same. The food gets worse and worse and I've terrible stomach pains clearly they are using expired food and should get checked. I'm sure currently they wouldn't pass the health inspection. This isn't normal and we decided to never go again after my husband also felt sick all weekend"}
{"text":"Very nice French breakfast options! Authentic French baked goodies! Love this place, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I simply can't give this cafe more than two stars. Were it not for it's incredibly cute interior and beautiful pastry case I'd be giving them one star.

I was there in the morning to get some work done while waiting for a doctor's appointment, excited to try a new place. I didn't check it out on Yelp! beforehand though. They don't have free wi-fi, so my mistake for not checking ahead of time. 

I told the cashier that it was my first time here and wasn't sure how this all worked - there is a process, believe me. She was more than happy to explain the number and table system. I think it's just confusingbecause it's a little like being a mouse in a maze when you walk in the door - narrow path going in front of the pastry case, then to the cashier, with not room to turn back if there are people behind you. 

When reviewing the milk options for hot drinks I was pleasantly surprised that they offered soy and almond milk. However, I just about fell over when she pointed out that it was an extra $2 to have almond milk!!! Really now, this is not even remotely close to fair for people who have intolerances.

Once recovered from my sticker shock, I chose their Signature iced tea and wove my way through the tightly packed tables with my rolling laptop bag in tow (now that, my friends, was funny). The server brought me a glass and a stoppered bottle of water while I waited, but I quickly had to call her back because the water glass smelled musty. Then, the final straw came...

I tried the Signture iced tea and it was incredibly, sickly sweet. Unsure of what to do since the server was very busy running around, I brought my drink up to the barista and asked about getting a cup of tea instead. The owner just happened to walk up, listened to my request and said it wouldn't be a problem. My next question was if I needed to see the cashier. After all, the iced tea was around $5 and the tea was just over $2, so fair is fair. She looked at me and said not to worry. \"Not to worry about what?\", I wondered. Not to worry that ey wouldn't refund the difference? When I brought this to her attention, she looked stunned that I would dare ask for even a partial refund, and walked off. She later found me at my table and told me she would \"go to her car to get the change\". What the !?!?!?

The one nice thing I have to say is that their patrons are open and friendly. I chatted with the people sitting next to me and they, too, admitted that this place is pretty pricey. My only hope is that the owner would see that people may be willing to try her establishment, but many more will be unwilling to return. So very unfortunate."}
{"text":"Lovely place for a nice coffee break in the afternoon on a Sunday with a colleague .I ordered the mochaccino - apparently it's espresso, dark chocolate and a bunch of other awesome stuff.my colleague had one of the \"red\" (ie rooibos) drinks.

I actually saw the place when I was at sushi place right next to it earlier this year and I wanted to try it so today I made the effort to come over with a colleague to enjoy this café place today.

I really enjoyed the atmosphere.and the set up.People working there were lovely."}
{"text":"Very pretentious. Very loud. Clearly care more about their bottom line cuz they pack their customers in by putting in too many tables and making it very uncomfortable. Also hot as shit... in October.. get some AC 
I understand you have a bunch of machines, but compensate for it, especially with how expensive you are. No excuse."}
{"text":"Although I am not too crazy on the quality of service, I will travel across town when the craving strikes for some damn good crepes."}
{"text":"Chic little cafe/bakery with a very nice atmosphere.  A little pricy but definately well made and friendly.

If you are looking for a quick lunch place in the area check it out and also the bakery for take out treats."}
{"text":"I went to Ladybug Cafe the other day with my friend because we had heard good things about it. We walked in, and were really confused about the ordering process, however, seeing as they are going for that European type vibe, I can see why they wanted to do it like that. I don't mind the whole ordering process, except since it was our first time there we both wanted to look at everything and take our time deciding. We had to let several people budge in front of us in the line because we were taking so long to decide, and it was a little awkward and I felt rushed...In the end I got the chocolate crepe and my friend got some fruit and yogurt crepe. We both decided to just get tea because we were paying outrageous amounts for our crepes and tea was the cheapest haha. 

Our food was really good. The presentation of it was beautiful and I almost wanted to just stare at my food rather than eat it. One thing I liked about this place is that their staff are really friendly and on top of everything. Although it is a cafe, we had a dining experience because the girl working kept coming over to see how everything was and cleared our plates for us etc...which only happens in regular cafes (such as starbucks) if you get an ambitious worker. 

This place is nice and the food was good, I just can't afford to ever come back again and get a crepe for 15$...it's a really nice place to treat yourself to but for the amount I paid I would've expected something that filled me up a bit more."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit to this place and in all possibility the last one!

Had Mediterranean Pasta which was supposed to mildly spicy or so it says on the menu - had no salt, no taste, absolutely bland-est tasting pasta I have ever had and that includes no-name pasta that one can find in local grocery store.

Vegetables were raw and seems they have not been sautéed at all - and something was off in the sauce that is not well received by my or my partners stomach.

Burgers that kids had were reasonable except for the size and 15-20 pieces of Lays chips it comes with.

Decor and ambience is definitely a plus point along with its location but I am afraid that's the only positives about this quite an expensive cafe in the town."}
{"text":"If the prices were less Aspen Green and more Bowness they'd have the best bakery of all time. Do drink the espresso and eat the chocolate croissants. Don't eat the crepes as they're wildly overpriced and underwhelming."}
{"text":"Just 4 words.
The Mousse au chocolat...
Soft and tasty like I love it..
I can eat 10 easily.
Just try and let me know."}
{"text":"I went to Ladybug Bakery on the weekend to celebrate my New Years 2017. The service was great the team there were Happy which is so nice to see. The pastries that I ate was fantastic, I would highly recommend this place to go to. I spoke to the owner Warwick was his name I believe and what a pleasant gentleman. I'll be going back.  Five Thumbs Up"}
{"text":"I have now been here twice. 
The first time I went I just had a latte and a cruffin, the lady at the till was very welcoming and friendly and was great when I asked questions. We sat down with our pastries and our coffees took forever to be made, we had finished our pastries and sat and talked and still had no coffees so I went up to the bar and asked for them to go. 
Second time I went for breakfast, much better experience. Everything came very quickly and service was great. Only complaint is there are very few waitresses working during a brunch rush on a weekend. My boyfriend had requested hot sauce and it was never brought to him as the girl was helping a lot every table in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Why so many bad reviews? This place is DELICIOUS!! Can be Pricy, buy fair for the quality, portions and ingredients. Different ordering and table system, but it's a small place and it works well. 

I've been coming here for years and their food is consistently delicious and always fresh! I've tried many items but we come back for the smoked salmon crepe and chicken sausage potato crepe. Both are delicious, fresh and filling but not greasy what so ever! Makes a treat brunch feel a bit lighter. We usually end off with a dark chocolate waffle. All their crepe and waffle combos are awesome though! Coffee and pastries are yummy too. If you like quality food, don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Don't forget to bring the hope diamond when you're visiting this place ...

The coffee at the lady bug is good but not great. The crepes and waffles are arranged beautifully and taste good, but the ordering system is rather complicated. I will say though that the decorations are nice and it's a cute little shop. 

But everything aside, this place is beyond expensive for what they are serving and the portions they are serving them at, and that's why it gets 3 stars and not 4."}
{"text":"I didn't expect to like this place as much as I do. Moving to the suburbs you get used to Starbucks and other chains, but this place is amazing. The pastries are some of the best you can get in Calgary; they do coffee right; their staff are friendly. Honestly, I've never had a single thing about my experience be anything but less than perfect."}
{"text":"We love this spot for brunch on Sundays! We often take home desserts for events and entertaining. Thank you Lady Bug! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"We went to this cute little place with our friends on a busy Saturday morning; the place was packed but we could be seated in less than 20 minutes. 
Everything we ordered tasted really good; it is more like home made fresh food; coffee was also good; I am just giving the 4 star rather than 5 as the price for every item in this cafe is so high, higher than expected."}
{"text":"This is our favourite place for lunch or brunch.  It's best to go early and avoid the rush, the food is always great as is the service.  If you are counting calories you may want to skip a day when having a pastry. Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"I've come here twice within a week while visiting Calgary. I'm not too keen on the ordering process where u line up and look at the menu above. I feel like I need to rush to decide what to order.  Then u get a number and they bring out your order to your table.  It gets soooo packed in there on a Saturday afternoon you cannot even get a seat.  Sure, you can order but after that you may need to stand wherever while waiting for a table to leave.  The concept is flawed.

On the other hand, the food is absolutely of the highest quality.  It is very pricey at about $13.50 for a crepe but they do use organic ingredients.  The strawberries are very fresh.  The coffee is really quite good too.  Even with the steep price I keep going back because I gotta say, you do get what you pay for in this case.

I usually order strawberry with banana crepes & a bowl of chicken soup.  (Because crepes alone won't fill me up.)  The soup is really quite good.  It is very baby friendly and they have high chairs that attach to the table for them.  The staff is so helpful and absolutely friendly. Love it!  The lost star is merely only for the crazy prices."}
{"text":"Have heard good things about the Ladybug Bakery and Cafe and decided to try it out with family.  The oldest son had previously tested this place out previously and had enjoyed it very much.  Husband and our son ordered the salmon linguine and I order the chicken and mushroom crepe.  They were very good and we enjoyed them.  We also had lattes which came in a large latte cup with designs of flowers swirled on them. Cute !
For dessert,  my husband and I shared the banana strawberry crepe with bernard chocolate sauce drizzled to share.  The son had his own.  It was quite huge and I don't think I could have finished one myself !  Although sonny boy wolfed his down in no time flat.  Nice place to have a coffee & dessert (lots of selections here and all homemade too ) or quick lunch to sit down and enjoy.  
This is located in the new Aspen Woods area on the southwest side of town and the area is developing fast with new restaurants and shopping.
Its a stone's throw from a great organic marketplace and and you can also stop at the Crave cupcake place close by too.  But this Ladybug place will be a nice place to come for lunch when I'm in the area !   We enjoyed ourselves very much and shall come back again.  But they don't open late or have fancy supper entrees."}
{"text":"A great neighbourhood option. The atmosphere is refined and polished while being relaxed. 
My food and beverages have been good with many options. I think their speciality is breakfast and I often order lunch choices at breakfast, which is why I haven't given 5 stars. A good option for those that want a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This cafe is very cutely decorated and very organic and homemade! My problem with this place is the portion size/pricing. $12 for a bowl of soup??! That is crazy. The chicken soup was good but holy the price was insane for the portion. I could feed my whole family for that price elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have used this place to cater buns for a big party, cakes for a birthday and have purchased their frozen croissants avec chocolat. 

All of the items I have tried from here have been great and usually it's pretty busy which has to mean a few people at least like it. 

I've never had a sit-in experience so I cannot rate that part of the biz at all. 

I have been there on one occasion where it was absolute pandemonium and I *think* ownership was there and being quite crusty to staff...though, maybe they're all crusty to eachother, I dunno...their battles don't make their wares takes any worse. 

It's a decent location for anyone around Bearspaw/Springbank or like me, in Bragg Creek. Good quality for an albeit high price without having to drive all the way into the city. 

I'd like to try a juice cleanse pack with them - just to see how that is put together but, I  am a vegan nutritionist so I have all the stuff at home...I know next to nothing about those offerings they have."}
{"text":"I take some of it back. I was there visiting the Cafe (the owners are old clients of mine) and they surprised me with a Crepe and Coffee.  I was floored.  The Ham and Cheese Crepe was absolutely awesome.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the equally impressive cappuccino as it offered a good sublime flavour that complimented the crepe well.

The only issue I find still is that it's still pretty far and out of the way for me in general (a 1/2 hour drive) especially as none of my friends and family live anywhere near there.  But I'd like to run down there on a lazy Sunday with nothing to do and enjoy a brunch soon."}
{"text":"Excellent!!... I really enjoyed this place. The  Sand Rose Tart is delicious!!.. And the French onion soup is very good too... I want to go back there soon, to try everything there!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for a while.  Who doesn't love baked goods?  Ordered the chicken and mushroom crepe along with the strawberry banana chocolate crepe.  Both were very tasty.  But I didn't detect much chicken in my crepe.  My only complaint."}
{"text":"Do you get a crepe or a waffle?? Um, the answer is both. Which I have done. Many times. No shame. They have a pretty decent selection for both waffles and crepes, which include both sweet and savoury. You can also customize both of them and add additional toppings if you think the party is still not big enough. This place isn't really cheap either. The waffles are pretty small for their price, hence why I usually go back and get to try something else, so it can get kinda expensive at the end of it all. I don't come here that often, so when I do, I kinda go all out. The presentation of the waffles and crepes are gorgeous and you can see like at least 5 people whipping out their phone and having a mini photo shoot with their food. 

The place itself is pretty cute with all white everything, which gives it a very crisp and clean look. When you walk in, the menu is on the wall and you line up and give your order in and you get a table number in return. If you want to order something else, you actually have to leave the place and re-enter through the entrance door so you can get back in line. It's really an odd set up and it makes it more cafeteria style, so it really takes away from the chic mood I feel like this place is trying to achieve. While I usually see new staff and servers there, there is this one woman I always see there (my guess is maybe she's the manager or one of the owners?) and she's usually one of the people that takes the orders. I honestly feel like she hates her job and she makes me feel rushed when I order, especially when there are people behind me. She doesn't give off a pleasant vibe and it makes me feel like I don't want to approach her if I have an issue. Thankfully I don't really remember when I really needed to, but I wouldn't want to with her. 

They do have other things on the menu and they have this glass casing with a whole bunch of different pastries and desserts along with savoury dishes such as salads, soups and sandwiches. I find it kinda odd because all of the savoury dishes are individually set up on the plate and just wrapped in plastic wrap. It makes me think that if you order it they simply take it out of the casing and heat it up. So I personally have never tried any of their other foods except their desserts and savoury crepes. 

Overall, their crepes and waffles are beautiful and delicious, but can be pricey. Their ordering system can definitely be improved, but I don't overly mind it."}
{"text":"Over priced, looks tasty, taste not to bad. Shall return to make my mind. Right now it's kind of mixed fillings."}
{"text":"Such a cute little cafe in Aspen.  I came at a non busy time, so I had the luxury of browsing the counters and the pretty jam-packed signs filled with what they serve.   Despite it not being busy, even I felt overwhelmed with all the somewhat kitschy stuff everywhere.   There's a little corner for juices, and weird pamphlets all over.   It just made me feel sort of anxious when trying to make a decision on what to order. 

I panicked and just ordered a chai latte.   They charge $3 for an upgrade to almond milk - almost the same price as an entire carton.   So I ended up paying almost $8 for a teeny latte.    Insanity!    Yes, it was delicious and the art was cute, but the price is ridiculous.   

They really pack people in on busy days, as even though it wasn't busy, the tables were SUPER close together.  

This place needs to get an identity and simplify - less is more I think, as they just have too much going on with their menu."}
