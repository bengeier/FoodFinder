{"text":"I'm not a \"pizza person\", but the hubby is.  Ordered delivery from here on a whim.  The pizza was really good.  I liked the crust, and it did not seem greasy.  We got half white sauce (garlic and oil) and half red, a bunch of veggies and I asked for chopped garlic to be added as a topping.  Very tasty.  I will definitely be ordering the occasional pizza from here, as I prefer theirs over Pizza by Robert and Sweet Basil.  Wish they had green olives as a topping and pesto sauce  UPDATE:  They now have green olives!"}
{"text":"Tried out Nirvana for dinner. Ordered a large pizza w black olives. Pizza was reasonably priced and was ready when I got there. Very friendly staff.   Pizza is New York style and was absolutely delicious. Definitely the best thin crust pizza I've had in Cleveland. This is definitely our new go to spot for takeout pizza!"}
{"text":"It's nice to have a local pizza establishment that provides quality ingredients. The Pizza Huts of the world serve their purpose for kids or when ordering in large quantities however if one is seeking unique pairings I would highly recommend Nirvana. The owner obviously cares about her clients and their palates. The BBQ Chicken is my favorite and typically what I order. I'm not sure where Jim D. is deriving a flavorless cracker disc. because I have observed the staff rolling out the dough and then placing into the pans??? Interesting. Everyone is of course entitled to their own opinions. Mine again is such that the ingredients are clearly thought out and of a much better than average quality. Please try Nirvana. There are a number of toppings to choose from including several sauces if you elect to think outside the box with regards to your typical pizza. Thank you and welcome to the neighborhood, Nirvana Pizza."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great customer service and the pizza is the best I've had in the entire cleveland area!!!"}
{"text":"Flavorless cracker disc.had sausage and banana pepper pizza ,I think it was sausage !! Really bland generic cheap tasting pizza.i wouldn't be surprised if the sauce wasn't just contadino or hunts pizza sauce ,I'm pretty sure it is!! If you like real pizza made with high quality ingredients and toppings this is not for you...on the other hand if you like little Caesars or even papa johns or any chain pizza you might like this pizza probably would appeal to younger customers with no developed palate"}
{"text":"We've been here a bunch of times. Easy, local, tastes good. I wish they had some salad options. Glad they started delivering. Noah is the best!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and Calzone.  My wife and I have ordered the specialty Buffalo Chicken pizza 3 times already and it's amazing! This last time we ordered delivery (in the snow storm!) and received our pizza and calzone hot and delicious inside their quoted 45 minutes. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Boring crust without much taste or chew (nice and thin though without being cracker-like); sauce tastes canned and like it is tomato paste mixed with water. Toppings cut nicely.  Sold as NY style pizza - but really not even close. If you live in Bay Village - you're better off getting Casa Vella from Crocker Park for NY Style pizza - or even Sweet Basil"}
{"text":"Also... I have to say the wings may need some work. They seem a little naked. I only write this bc I believe in constructive criticism. On a waaaay positive note; let's talk about the garlic cheese breadsticks. I never get breadsticks before pizza bc in my head it's basically the same BUT these garlic bread sticks have changed me, the cheese on the outside is crispy fried and when you bite in, you bite into a burst of garlic flavor. Top notch! I love pizza nirvana!!!!!"}
{"text":"I tried Nirvana Pizza after one of my friends told me about it!  FINALLY a GREAT pizza place in Bay Village!  I was visiting a friends home in Westlake and told her we needed to order from there.  I placed a take out order and went to pick it up on a Friday night.  Ordered two large cheese pizzas and three specialty pizzas.  ( I was feeding 5 adults and 6 teenage girls!)  The quality of the ingredients was EXCELLENT!  It is New York style - which I love -the thin crust melted in your mouth.  The pizza FLEW out of the box and we all commented how yummy all of it was.  They did not have chicken wings yet but told us they were  'coming soon' just like delivery is!  WAAHOOO!  All i can say is 'TRY IT'.  Easy parking and very nice staff.  My only suggestion:  get a sign that lights up outside!  I almost missed you!  But thanks for coming to our neck of the woods.  We can't wait to try your wings and calzones next!"}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea.  I prefer Danny Boy's or Papa Johns.  Was generally bland, and a bit floppy."}
{"text":"Very, very good pizza pie. Dough and crust are baked perfectly for the \"New York\" style. Sauce is mild and tasty. Toppings standard and fresh. No surprises or trying to be too cute, just good fresh normal pizza pie."}
{"text":"great pizza great price.  two big slices and a soda for 5.50! the sauce is great the cheese and crust are fantastic. friendly staff and very fast!"}
{"text":"Really glad we tried Nirvana.  It has great pizza, cheese bread and the wings are even pretty good.  The sauces they have for the pizzas and wings are pretty good too.    Only thing I would say is they don't always open at the hours listed. It's a new business and the winter has been bad, so I'll give them a pass on that.  But it's nice to have them in Bay!"}
