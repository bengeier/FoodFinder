{"text":"Better Kitchen is cheap, average Chinese fast food. 
I ordered the tofu with vegetables and mushrooms with white rice. It came with the free soy milk. 
There's tons of tofu but not enough vegetables. I find the food a little bit on the salty side. The soy milk was great, though. 

The service was great. It came in less than 10 minutes considering there are so many people lining up for their food."}
{"text":"Super cheap and decent quality eats. Located in the really dingy food court of Oriental Centre, Better Kitchen is easily the most popular stand. It has been there for as long as I can remember, and it's probably not leaving any time soon. 
I usually drop by here after school for a quick snack (mostly fried squid, which is very good) and their original HK style milk tea bubble tea. Their milk tea bubble tea is super addictive and flavourful, and for only $2.50 it's a lot cheaper than Chatime or other drinks from bbt shops. Their milk tea is always consistent and delicious, but their tapioca quality is not always great. 
One of the older ladies is super sweet and nice and speaks English very well! The younger lady is not quite as nice, but she's not totally rude.
Have been a regular here for years, and will continue to be."}
{"text":"For a fast food joint in a food court, this place is pretty good.

The hk milk tea was comparable to what you can get in HK.

Congee was really hot and flavourful.

Definitely would return for a hk fix if I'm in the area again

Cash only."}
{"text":"We were checking out the Oriental Centre at Sheppard Ave E at Brimley, and tried the food court.  Better Kitchen was one of our options, so we gave it a try.  25 March 2018, Sunday afternoon and the last time I was at this small but interesting mall was about 15 years ago, the parking was brutal and reminded me of Pacific Mall!  However today we found a parking spot, as another patron was leaving.  The mall is very clean, and the food court had a full time cleaner, so the tables were spotless.  At Better Kitchen, they did have a combo option so we tried that.  It consisted of a Chicken Congee, Rice noodle with shrimp and soya milk for only $6.50.  For the two of us not being that hungry, it was perfect.  My husband had the Rice Noodle with shrimp and I had the Congee.  The congee was very tasty, with lots of chicken pieces.   We will definitely go here again.  The lady at the counter was very friendly, polite and smiling."}
{"text":"There is a reason why this place has stayed for years. I think I was 12 when I started coming here; I'm 21 right now. 

I've only really ordered one menu item here, beef chow fun (non-spicy), but it's consistently made really well (super tasty!). This is my favourite place to get them. They occasionally give out soy milk with my order.
 
It's tucked in the corner of the food court, so it might be easy to miss."}
{"text":"The only reason why I come over here.....this place has the most bomb pork fried rice I've tasted...with just about $12 I can get an order of pork fried rice with my favourite honeydew bubble tea........probably not good if your counting macros but its so damn delicious i that could care less :)"}
{"text":"The price is good! All the orders comes with free soy milk.

I usually has the fried noodles/rice or the wonton noodle soup.

There are pictures on the wall that are showing you what exactly you going to get, take out all the guessing work!

The dishes are not too good.. all the stired fried has tons of green/red pepper as fillings and hardly has any meat/seafood in it! I would suggest to stay away from that!

It is in the food court in the Oriental Mall."}
