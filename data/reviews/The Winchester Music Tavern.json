{"text":"A hidden gem in the Birdtown section of Lakewood, The Winchester Music Tavern featuring live bands and a 100 inch screen for sporting events is an awesome venue serving fantastic from scratch food and great signiture cocktails as well as a great selection of beers and booze  all at attractive low prices. This place is a real winner!"}
{"text":"If you're on the Atkins Diet, leave your carb counters at home. Not only did I just tear through a pile of $0.60 wings (the Wednesday night special) smothered in Gorilla BBQ sauce, but I just asked for a slice of bread to sop up and consume the last of the sauce. And WOW is my rum and coke strong. And ever Wednesday night, there's a $5 comedy show. But do get the wings!"}
{"text":"Best brunch in Cleveland. Unlimited mimosas, delicious food, and perfect brunch music! The breakfast burrito and French toast were especially amazing but all the food was good. Tim and the rest of the staff is so helpful, quick, and friendly..they just wanted to make sure we had a good time and enjoyed our food and drinks. Went there with a group of friends on a Sunday and had so much fun we stayed for hours. Such a good deal-- a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!!!!! Tons of food specials....wednesdays is $5 jumbo wing day and omg the wings are like no others anywhere. You have to come in and try them! They have an incredible back area for bands, comedy, stand up, burlesque and other acts. Drinks are well priced and everything on the menu is great!"}
{"text":"This music Tavern is a great addition to the Bird Town neighborhood in Lakewood. Very affordable drinks and the food is A1. I had the duck fat fries and they were cooked to perfection, not greasy at all. The staff is attentive and all in all we had a great experience here. If you are a late night person then don't miss out on all the great local talent that they showcase here, it is a music bar after all."}
{"text":"We love Yacht Rock Brunch! If you enjoy eating tasty breakfast foods and enjoying a build your own Bloody Mary bar to the soothing tunes of Michael McDonald, stop by the Winchester on Saturday mornings 11-3. They even have a stack of captain's hats to complete the mood."}
{"text":"Ordered the veggie burger uber eats tonight and now I have food poisoning so thank you very much for that"}
{"text":"I've been here before, but it was a while ago. Happy hour $2 16oz PBR and $5 burgers on Tuesdays. It was quite dead, but i was there in the beginning of the week and before 6pm. Atmosphere was nice and quiet and quaint perfect for two buds to hang out and catch up a little. Good possibility that I may be back."}
{"text":"It's a Sunday and of course I'm gonna have some Bottomless mimosas! I'm 5 drinks In and I just received my food! 

I ordered Chicken and Waffles . I love fried chicken, so I had to..duh. Anyways lol I'm honestly tipsy and stoned right now and I'm gonna enjoy the shit out of this. 

Ok so I finished the chicken and waffles and it was delicious and I loved the fried chicken! It was extra crispy just how I like it! 

My friend and I decided we were still hungry after 7 mimosas so we both ordered \"The Winchester American Breakfast \" let's see how this goes. I ordered extra bacon and scrambled eggs with mine. Enxhru ordered over medium with bacon. 

Wow can't believe my fat ass ate a second meal. It was delicious"}
{"text":"Their vegan Monday... let me tell you... you won't be disappointed!!! It's only the second week of \"vegan Monday\" and you'd think they'd been doing this for years. The chef is AMAZING! He understands the importance of flavor and texture and offers a complex array of complimentary vegan items! I'm sooooo impressed! I will absolutely be returning to Vegan Monday's and you should too! Also, they're adding new vegan items to their regular menu - score! :)"}
{"text":"This is a buddy bar. If you aren't buddies with the bartender you aren't getting served. The bartender's buddy got two rounds before we got looked at."}
{"text":"I knew this was the right place, when Keith Sweat's \"Twisted\" came on. It was Sunday and I had a craving for a Bloody Mary and brunch food.  I didn't want to go to the usual spots, I wanted something new. That's when I found myself at the Winchester. They have build-your-own Bloody Marys for $5-I piled mine high w/ cheese cubes, bacon, salami, McClures pickles and stuffed olives.  They also offer bottomless mimosas for $15 and a tasty menu with breakfast offerings. They have fun shot specials, like The Irish Breakfast-which is Jameson, Butterscotch Schnapps with an O.J chaser.  The bartender was awesome and and I really loved all the 90's music playing. Definitely coming back the next time I have a bloody mary/brunch craving"}
{"text":"The drinks here are CHEAP. Great bar food too. They have deals everyday, ask the bartender about them."}
{"text":"Great dive bar! They have an awesome music space in the back and bottomless mimosas on the weekends for $15!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Unsure of what to expect I ventured in here to try the wings as they were recommended to me. The atmosphere is relaxed and the bar tender and cook were both very nice. Yes the cook, he came out and talked to us about the wing sauces and that they are made in house and even gave us options not on the menu. Got the garlic parm wings and honey habanero. Both were good. The garlic parm is a cream type sauce different then what you would vision for garlic parm and it was really tasty as was the honey habanero. The wings are big and I enjoyed them. The only negative thing I have to say about this place is the bathroom was not great at least for the ladies. Two stall bathroom with one stall completely dark because the light didn't stretch over that stall so couldn't really see. Soap was in like sauce type bottle, papertowels were out. The stall with the light didn't flush. So overall I enjoyed this place the atmosphere the wings. Just go potty before you go and you will be good."}
{"text":"What do I need to say besides $15 bottomless mimosas at brunch?!?

But really. The brunch menu is DELICIOUS and affordable. The yacht rock music make for a fun Saturday! 

$5 Bloody Mary bar. Great music. Bottomless mimosas. All a win."}
