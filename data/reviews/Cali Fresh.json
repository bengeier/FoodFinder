{"text":"Talk about having delicious Californian and Mexican food on the go!  I've had a few visits at Cali fresh, and everytime I get wonderful, quick and friendly service, and mouth watering tacos!!! My all time favorite taco would have to be the Pacific shrimp taco, the sauce (AMAZIIIING) that is placed over on top gives it that grand finale after every single bite! They always seem to have a long line, but it's defitnely worth the wait. Check them out when you see them at events around Madison you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"At a recent Concerts on the Square I was in need of dinner and saw the line for Cali Fresh was out of control. Instead of shying away from the wait, I decided to take the implied advice of COTS dinner seekers and hop in line. I remember trying a taco from Cali Fresh a couple of years ago at a food cart festival, but couldn't recall much detail aside from remembering chopped up beef and a generally favorable experience.   I opted for a beef burrito this time around and was pleased. As the name would lead you to believe, the cart does a lighter take on Mexican food. My burrito had a good balance of hearty fillers like pinto beans, chopped steak, and rice as well as a fresh kick with lettuce and pico de gallo. The tortilla was nicely grilled and the burrito didn't fall apart as I was eating it - a blessing in a picnic setting.   The Giant Taco sounded delicious due to the inclusion of avocado, but it was unclear if it came with rice and beans. The COTS menu sounded like it did, but the cart menu on display had no reference to sides. Plus, $4 seemed too inexpensive for a taco plus sides. When there's not a mile-long line behind me I'll have to inquire about what's what.   Cali Fresh is a pretty inexpensive food cart choice that offers a fresher alternative to the big burrito chains."}
{"text":"Tried this food cart for the first time the other day-why haven't I started going here sooner? Food is delicious and lived up to the fresh in its name.  My food was prepared very quickly- I got two vegan cauliflower tacos with a side of the chipotle sauce-so much flavor packed into the tacos, which were topped with pico de gallo, cabbage, and fresh lime.  They forgot my avocado but they were so nice I didn't feel like asking for it. Line moves very fast and they take credit cards, always a bonus for food carts. 10/10 will be going back!"}
