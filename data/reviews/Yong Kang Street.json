{"text":"I came here with relatives visiting from out of town. They stayed in paris and we decided to eat here. There are two dimsum places that I know of outside the strip that are good and inexpensive. Well i was disappointed there weren't a lot of dimsum selections. Place is small and cramped, server was ok. We ended up ordering noodles. It was bland. The chicken taste just okay must be a frozen chicken from Vons."}
{"text":"Clearly a lot of Asian people eat here which is or says something!
BUT cold egg rolls - and water glasses that smell they just had a cup of bleach in them isn't good or safe !.
Where is the Nevada state health board?
Keeping hundreds of thousands safe?."}
{"text":"Giving 2 stars because of the service. I understand Vegas has changed. It used to be that you could get a great meal for a steal, but now it's as if you've walked into an amusement park. I ate the Shrimp udon- $20 and it only comes with 2 shrimp. The dish wasn't very flavorful. The food was hot and fast. That's about the best of it."}
{"text":"I dont normally write reviews but the food, service, and atmosphere of this restaurant was off the charts. 

I went back 3 times during my visit. Sooo Mi was my favorite server, she was so nice to me during my stay there. 

Hello to all the staff! Love you guys!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch around 1. We were immediately seated. First impressions were nice decor and cool open kitchen area. We got some dim sum dishes, har gao and shu mai and other classic dim sum dishes. They were pretty average. I'm from DC and we have quite a few good dim sum restaurants so I wasn't impressed. I came with family and we also got the Singaporean noodles with chicken and house fried rice. Both were pretty average by my scale. I feel like I could've made either dish myself. Overall average quality."}
{"text":"We passed by here last night and came back this morning to enjoy a meal. The menu looked great. Too bad the hostess would rather leave a few empty tables within the restaurant and sit us next to the walkway. When we asked to be seated inside, she informed us with attitude that we would need to wait. We were willing to wait,  but we were not willing to put up with the attitude...moving on!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place again... 
Service is amazing and food got somewhat better but still not that great.."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place only has three stars. The food is amazing. Everything is vey authentic. The dim sum was delicious and I highly recommend any dish with duck. I recommend coming here rather than waiting in line for the Paris buffet."}
{"text":"Pork buns were under cooked, my meal never came. Over priced and not awesome. $5 for an ice tea."}
{"text":"I swear to god everyone here who gives a review of anywhere above 2 stars or says \"the taste is okay\" has NO SENSE OF TASTE. Sorry for the insult. 
The Japanese Tonkotsu Ramen did not taste anywhere near what it should taste like, the broth does not even taste like a pork bone broth, it was terrible! It was so bad to the point I need to flood my soup with chilly oil! 
The smoked duck simply tasted like a salty piece of chicken in my opinion. The meat is tough, definitely the quality I expect from such a place.
Note that the restaurant is in Las Vegas, the price would be high. However, the price does not reflect the quality and standard of the food in the restaurant. I will definitely not pay such a high price for a lousy bowl of ramen again!"}
{"text":"I should have known better than to come here. The food was awful. I ordered the Dandan Noodles. I struggled to eat  my entree and could only finished it because I forced myself to, and it was a painful experience. My girlfriend agreed that it sucked. We had better Chinese and Japanese food in Vegas both at higher and lower price points."}
{"text":"This restaurant was conveniently located in Paris hotel where we stayed at during our Christmas vacation. Location within the hotel was excellent and so was the decor with all the lights, lanterns and stuff getting my undivided attention. I really wanted to like this place but the portions for the price was not worth it. We ordered $60 worth of food for a family of four with two kids and we weren't even half full. Quality was a hit and miss (pork ramen, dumplings were delicious but the BBQ pork wasn't that great unless you like fat and slightly burnt meat). Our waiter was friendly and even tried to talk to me in Mandarin but I don't speak the language -- I appreciate it though. We ended up going across the street afterwards to Serendipty 3 to get more food and dessert (price and portions there were much more reasonable considering Vegas that is, but that's for another review)."}
{"text":"Everything here is ridiculously pricey. I had wonton noodle soup(yellow noodle ,4dumplings , a couple pieces of broccoli) The dumpling was ok but the broth tasted like salt water with msg added. If you charge $18 bowl of soup ,you should make it worth the price. I could have gone to China town and had a nice bowl of soup for under$ 12."}
{"text":"This is in the French themed hotel in Las Vegas. We are here around 10 am. Wait staff were very efficient. Food was good quality. Dim sum cart was nice. Desert cart looked promising. Would come back again."}
{"text":"No where close to the real food on Yong Kang street in Taiwan...disappointed.

As a Taiwanese American, I was super excited when I found out there's a Taiwanese cuisine in Vegas. My wife and I got all crazy/excited and decided to dine here (without checking YELP reviews...which we probably should have)

The service was great but the food was just a disappointment. The Xialongbao(soup dumpling) were very dry. The price were overprice too. Yes, I know everything is expensive in Vegas but with the price tag like this, one can probably find a better restaurant somewhere else."}
{"text":"The Taiwanese noodle was good, service was excellent too. And, we forgot our handbag there and they kept that safely for us. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Really good food and service was just fine. Try the dim sum. It's a good thing when you see Asian people eating at a Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"We found this place as we wandered through The Paris as we were out and about one day. We were hungry and this sounded good. We shared the BBQ Pork Lo Mein and the steamed dumplings. Both were really good. We honestly expected it to be just ok, being an Asian place in The Paris. We were pleasantly surprised. The noodles were perfectly done, great flavor and lots of meat and veggies. Portion was perfect for sharing. The dumplings were awesome. They had great texture and good flavor. We would definitely come back. A nice surprise. Not overly priced either."}
{"text":"Terrible service and taste. It's a disgrace to Taiwanese tradition and culture by serving what you call authentic."}
{"text":"Very good Beef noodle service and great service. Definitely will come back here next time when I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place not only is its expensive the food is God awful. We order two orders of spring rolls that looked and tasted like they came from the frozen food section of Walmart. Not only were they awful they were still cold on the inside

Order bowl of Won Ton soup that the broth was boiling hot and tasteless. The Won Ton were over cooked and soggy

Only saving face is fresh set of customers daily. If this place was off strip it would be closed with food like this

The hostess also had an attitude, seems not only she not care she was rude. The other customers sitting around us also were not happy with the food nor service"}
{"text":"Very PRICEY. One order of chicken friend rice cost $20, serving is very small, which is not even enough to feed one person. 

Food is pretty oily, doesn't taste good"}
{"text":"Expensive and not worth the price with the consideration of the quality and quantity. I ordered a duck rice and it costs 17 dolla and there are only four ducks with the rice."}
{"text":"Had a few random dim sum dishes as well as the beef noodle soup. Service was fast and though not perfect, pretty good for a \"Chinese\" restaurant (as others mentioned, they serve a mix of Cantonese, Taiwanese, and even Japanese inspired dishes).

Dishes are all probably about 2X as expensive as they would be outside of the Vegas strip, but that just comes with the location.

Would add that the server did hover over us while we were trying to write in the tip on the receipts instead of waiting till we were gone to pick it up."}
{"text":"Was at a conference at the Paris hotel 
Ate here as I only had 1 hour for a quick lunch
The Singapore noodles were delicious. I'd eat here again. Definitely try if you are in the Paris hotel"}
{"text":"Great dim sum, tender pastries with superb pork, shrimp, and duck fillings . We never even got to the great looking noodle bowls because we filled up on so much dim sum!"}
{"text":"Good value quick service duck and pork bowl very good. Dim sum limited hut decent priced for las vegas very good."}
{"text":"Food is good! Soup is hot, service is fast, the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the dumpling from the dim sum cart was cold. We ordered the shrimp and pork won ton soup. One with egg noodles and one with rice noodles. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Omg! We have always been a fan of anime partly because of the food they eat. It looks so fun, cute and yummy to eat and boy we were not disappointed. Yong Restaurant is the place to go to if you are craving foreign asian food! I could not stop saying wow. The staff were very friendly and quick on serving. We were sat down and they took our order for drinks and as our waiter went to go get our drinks an employee comes in with a food cart filled with yummy goodies! Don't be scared to taste it, it was totally worth it for us. I wish we had one of these back home."}
{"text":"super bad experience? they doubled the price compared to some local Chinese restaurants. However, the taste is not as good as those restaurants in china town. Even worse, they raise the price again at midnight, which is terrible no matter taste or price. Probably you get a bad taste noodles for $25+, and which is worth only $8-10 at local restaurants.You cannot imagine how bad it is! I would never come back, never!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is very Vegas w/ modern decor and club music playing and the prices are very Vegas too. Unfortunately the food isn't worth it unless you're starving. Very plain. And this is the first time I've ever been charged for tea done careful when they \"offer\" tea or water."}
{"text":"We had dinner here and the food was very bad. I hate to say this because I've been to Taipei and love their cuisine. Quite frankly the food tasted like something you'd get if you went to an Americanized  \"Chinese\" restaurant in Podunk, Arkansas. Here's a bright-line rule for Chinese restaurants: If you are served a dipping sauce that's bright red and sweet, you know you're in for a horrid culinary experience. Yep, this place served rock-hard crispy \"vegetable rolls\" with such a sauce. Dinner for 3 cost $70! Seriously, you can eat better at Panda Express for 1/3 the cost. The dim sum was very limited (just one cart with about 6 choices). But hey, when all the food is bad, less is more."}
{"text":"I was nervous to try after I read all the negative reviews, but this place is truly awesome! So good in fact, we ate there for dinner two days in a row!

Service is amazing and food comes out within 5 minutes of ordering. I got the stir-fried ramen with lobster the first night (it was HEAVENLY) and the next, shrimp tempura udon. I recommend the ramen over the udon, but both were fantastic. Spring rolls are also great! 

I'd come here again and again if I could. Definitely delicious and fairly reasonable for the amount of food you get.

TRY THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"We walked in this place because the front and interior design catched our attention. We don't expect a good authentic Chinese restaurant in Vegas but this place is just really bad. The taste is bad and the service wasn't great either. my friend and I ordered bean paste noodle and pork chop noodle, they're supposedly taste different and with different toppings. However, these two dishes taste exactly the same! We conf8red with the waitress to see if they made a mistake AND they kept insist they're entirely different noodles+toppings/sauce and stated that \"Its their style making these noodles\"!   

OVER ALL:
I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL

FOOD TASTES BAD 
SERVICE IS BAD"}
{"text":"We have very high expectation for this place and we could have gone to La Village next door for breakfast buffet, We were very disappointed about this place. 

Ok number 1, let's be honest the food taste average, not good, not terrible but average.... 2.Service: the font desk lady Maybe she is the owner I m not sure... but her face let us feel that we owe her a lot of money, a male waiter brings me my noodle using just one hand and his thumb in the soup which made me very uncomfortable. 3. over priced, ok I understand this is Vegas but come on I can get be world's best soup in the heart of Manhattan for under $15, they charge $20 for a noodle soup. One glass of coke is 3.88.... please see the attached receipt and reconsider if you want to come. 

My suggestion that is the la village buffet next to it will be better choice."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place by accident.  I have probably walked past it a hundred times and never noticed it.  We were able to get seated pretty quickly and found that the place had an upbeat and vibrant atmosphere.  It was clean and comfortable.  A great place to hang when you want a fun night out.

While the food is a little pricey, you pay for the location.  I kind of like the fact that the prices ended in .88.  We were on the Strip and didn't feel like heading out because we were on a roll.  The Dim Sum cart had a great offering.  The food was flavorful, salty and delicious.

I enjoyed the Chinese Broccoli in Oyster Sauce.  It was savory and salty.  The broccoli was cooked al dente and had a nice firmness to it.  The spicy won ton dumplings were full of flavor.  I would have preferred them spicier, but then again, I didn't ask them to be spicier, and being in Vegas, this restaurant has to cater to all types of people.  Like my mom.  She thinks that the pico de gallo on a fajita at Chili's is too spicy.  This would have probably killed her.

So, we have covered the price, touched on the ambience, and talked about the food.  What's left?  The service.  It was attentive.  It was seamless.  I didn't have to ask for anything as my needs were anticipated by the staff.  It didn't disturb our conversation and we almost didn't notice it, which is the best service there is."}
{"text":"My family & I decided to stop by for some quick dim sum before exploring the strip, we got as not a lot of patrons were there. We picked a few items off the list a server gave us. Each dim sum dish ranged between $6-9 dollars USD which made my family & I miss our authentic dim sum back at home in Vancouver for a fraction of the price. The item we picked tasted alright & the portions were on the small/decent side. If we could go back in time, we would've picked something else on the strip for brunch than a $70 USD meal that barely filled us up."}
{"text":"I wanted to order the Lobster fried noodle instead of lobster noodle soup. I was my mistake that I didn't ask but it's a tasty  bowl of noodle soup. I would eat here."}
{"text":"We came here after a long walk on the strip. We ordered the Japanese and Korean noodles. The Japanese noodles were traditional.The dumplings were by far the best I've tried. I love how they walk around with the cart of dumplings so if you want more they're easily accessible.  Also loved the decor and the attention the servers provide. Just for two people we spend 70 dollars but everything on the strip is the same price."}
{"text":"I've been to Taipei, had Taiwanese traditional and street foods; and this place was surprisingly authentic and good. The members in our Asian family, who are usually very picky and discrimatory in their Asian food tastes thought the selections they ordered were delicious.

We had Taiwanese beef noodle, Hong Kong style wonton noodle, minced pork over rice, pot stickers, and few other items. They were all tasty and authentic. 

The service was good despite its being very busy during the holidays. 

The decor was interesting and worth artistic attention. 

The only thing that was not authentic was the price. But anyone who expects cheap prices for good quality on LV strips is as foolish as those who believe they can win big at the casinos."}
{"text":"Had a great meal! We trusted our waiter Mike to pick out our meals based on our preferences and he was spot on!"}
{"text":"Just not good. I've had better food from an old can and the service was almost as bad. RIPOFF!!!"}
{"text":"The location inside the Paris casino along the restaurant row is convenient while we were already there.  The service was a quick fast food like- no different than many other dim sum house... Okay, maybe these guys here are nicer.  So this place worked out for something quick for me and the wife.  She had the bbq pork fried rice and I had shrimp fried rice.  The flavors are there but the rice was an under done steamed rice and then fried- I wasn't crazy about it, neither was my wife.  With a draft beer, it came out to $40.69.  So if I'm in a hurry again and nothing else are open, I could go there... Maybe.  ...convenience... ugh!  Rice crisps or oat bars is an option."}
{"text":"We ate here for a quick lunch. As we were eating (food that I was not impressed with at all) we see someone in the kitchen with gloves on digging her fingers in her mouth. We dropped our forks in disgust. She then starts messing with dishes, with the nasty gloves still on. I go ask to see a manager and the hostess said there was not one there. As I am doing that, the waitress comes to our table and asks if everything is okay. While this is going on the same lady starts picking her nose with those same nasty gloves. The waitress says not to worry she is only a dishwasher. We told her that we understand but she is touchy plates and silverware that we eat out of with those gloves. She also said there was no manager. Everyone was listening to us and starring so she asked us to leave and told us we did not have to pay and that is all she could do for us. DO NOT EAT HERE"}
{"text":"I was surprised to see that it only has 3 stars on Yelp. 

I really enjoyed it. It was not packed or had to wait in line. I ordered the Taiwanese chicken fried rice and I really enjoyed it. The rice had a lot of flavor. My husband ordered the Taiwanese beef noodle soup and as well no complaints over his plate. Plenty of flavor, everything was well done. 

Service was great. Our server was very attentive and kept walking over to us to make sure we did not need anything. I would say there a language barrier since we weren't able to understand the waiter when we asked questions or the woman walking around with the cart.

I would totally recommend this place. Every time we walked by it was never full which was nice to eat at a restaurant that was not packed. I feel the restaurant is underrated Since it is not that large and there is a lot of competition around. 

I did not rate it 5 stars due to prices of course it will be pricey due to location and the language barrier. Besides that the food is definitely 5 stars."}
{"text":"Egg noodles and dense little wontons were fantastic.  Soup base was great. Dumplings and Pork buns from the carts were the same.  I'm a dim sum and noodle veteran and All in all a great experience.  Not sure what's with the past reviews that gave low marks."}
{"text":"This place is was not that great. Dim sum is outranglusly expensive for what it is ranging from \"that's kinda expensive\" to \"wtf? That's it for that price???!\",and the cart was only offered once....I thought they are suppose continuously come with more options....

But at least you get an option to choose entrees from a menu, offering dishes from other Asian menus (Vietnamese, tiawaneese...) me and my boyfriend ordered the minced pork meat over rice (only because so many reviews said it was great), it just tasted \"bleh,\" and makes me leave thinking \"I should have just gone to get McD\"

The best part of my meal was the ice latté my boyfriend got me next door"}
{"text":"Taste average and not really authentic Taiwanese cuisine, personal opinion though. But really pricy. Won't try it again."}
{"text":"Our waiter was awesome in personality and suggestions. I wanted to try something we so I got Taiwan noodles. I've had ramen and udon and the Taiwan noodles with its dark broth was ok. Maybe I'll try the ramen next time? Husband had the duck. They bring it out sliced in the bone. Unfortunately there were only about 6 pieces out of about 14 that had meat on it. The star was the dimsum. Our waiter said that we may need soy sauce but it was seasoned fine without it. We are there last night and I'm thinking I want more tonight."}
{"text":"We were attracted by the name of the restaurant because it's named after one of the most famous restaurant streets in Taipei, Taiwan. We ordered the beef noodle soup, spicy wonton dumplings, and juicy pork dumplings. ALL delicious! Their beef noodle soup was probably the best I've ever had in the US so far. The downside of this place would be the high price of everything- but they are located in a hotel and the quality of the food is really unbeatable. So I think it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. We ordered four different dishes and all were fantastic!!! Great service and atmosphere too. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Just happened to see this restaurant while going to my room

Surprised to see a Chinese/Asian that actually had decent food"}
{"text":"All these one star reviews are right! This shop instantly loses 3 stars for the price. 5 of us ate here, and the total was $86. The first dish we had was too salty so that loses another 1/2 star. The last half star is also due to the price.  The menu says there is a 18% forced gratuity for 6 people, and when we asked why they forced it on us(without telling us beforehand) for 5 people, they said it was due to holiday weekend. Overall not worth it, just go to a buffet or head down to chinatown for equally good food!"}
{"text":"Glad i did not follow the reviews.  The place had great service and food, i had the beef noodles.  The price was high but not when compared to other Las Vegas strip places"}
{"text":"Such a good find! The atmosphere is great. On the \"street\" in Paris. The food was superb. Try the tempura shrimp soup with udon noodles. It was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm going to vote based on price discrepancy. Anyplace that charges $20 for a bowl of pho is definitely at least $$$, NOT $$!  I don't care WHERE the place is!

I had Taiwanese beef noodle, also $20. It was good, but not $20 good. (The pizza place 5 doors down have a whole pizza for ~ $20!"}
{"text":"BBQ pork was cold and no taste.  Duck was mostly bone.  Chicken rolls on the cart were cold. Tea was made using tea bags. ??"}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere and well priced. Even had veggie ramen options, plus all around."}
{"text":"Yummy food excellent fried rice and noodles.
Great service thanks to chef for great shredded chicken fried rice."}
{"text":"4 stars for dim sum carts and Hot green tea. Great services  waiters /waitresses always smiling . Stayed in vegas 3 days atet there 3 times. Loved it!!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good fresh Dim Sum and nice good noodles, forget this place. Food are prepared long time ago, just reheat in the microwave before serve.  Found flys at the bottom of the vinegar bottle. Low quality!!!"}
{"text":"Located straight back from valet towards self parking. Sadly I asked two people one in a suit and another in uniform had no idea where the restaurant was located much less that it even existed in the Paris Hotel. 

After the sticker shock of their prices I expected INCREDIBLE food but was just ok. If I want to eat expensive dim sum and rice I'd head to Wazuzu at least the food is awesome there.  Or Ping Pang Pong at the Gold Coast just down the street. (my favorite)

The best of what we ordered ended up being their Vietnamese noodle soup (pho) at a whopping $19. At this price drive down to Pho Kim Long in China Town and you can get two yummy bowls!"}
{"text":"Before you pick this place, have to very be careful, check your bill carefully, they put 18% tips on your bill without notice, even for two peoples. We asked them about it, the manager told us is was required, it's rediculs, never come back again!!!"}
{"text":"Dan Dan noodles with shrimp. Decent flavor. Not spicy though it was indicated that it would be.  I added some chili paste and it was good. 

Dim Sum cart shrimp dumplings were excellent in texture and taste."}
{"text":"After many visits at Paris in Vegas, we finally decided to take in lunch at Yougn Kang Street.
The veg spring rolls were crispy & tasty.    The Wonton Noodle & Hong Kong Style Noodle bowls were decent tasting.  While the dim sum cart came by, we also decided to get the Sui Mai (pork) dish.  Waiter was attentive. Overall thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great place to get a quick, good meal. They roll carts around and offer you dim sum and or their appetizers. Great fast service. And if you check in you get options of a drinks. Thai tea delicious fyi."}
{"text":"This place was so good I visited it twice - I had the Taiwan beef soup noodles and they were the best that I have ever had. The se vice was quick and the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Late at night, a steaming noodle bowl was very appealing.  Unfortunately, this is not the place, the tonkutsu ramen bowl I had just wasn't right, tasted like supermarket ramen.  The dim sum items were a bit better, bland and small portion but edible, nowhere near what you'd get in Chinatown but I couldn't walk that far :-)  Next time I'll keep walking though."}
{"text":"They absolutely refuse to answer any of their telephones, so good luck getting a hold of them if for example like me you'd like an itemized receipt. Their inbox is full so you can;t leave a message. And you can't get an itemized receipt from them through  Paris Las Vegas accounting.  Stay away if you value normal Western standards of service.  The food? Hohum."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch and dinner on the same day while attending a conference. The servers were super nice both times and the quality of food was great. Since it was cold here in Vegas, i was in the mood for something warm. I had a Hong Kong chicken noodle soup for lunch that was great with grilled chicken and for dinner i had a beef soup that was even better! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good!!!!! They have great service and delicious food!!! First time in Vegas Baby!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I always come here at least once when we go to Las Vegas regardless of where we are staying. They have an assortment of dumpling and spring rolls and the sticky buns are the best! All of the noodle options are amazing. The best thing about this restaurant is the service. It doesn't matter who your waiter is, the minute they see you need something any of the waiters come to fix it and help you."}
{"text":"Very tasty and spicy, just the way I like it!"}
{"text":"I think you all are too hard on this place. If you want \"howdy y'all\" service then go to Denny's. Chinese social graces are more transactional. And that's OK because you're here for the food right? We loved our spicy dumplings, crab dimsum, Xiao Long Bao, and Miso ramen. Each of us could choose to eat big or small, the food came out fast, and the ambience was great."}
{"text":"Casual but pretty good.

Right in the middle of the busy promenade of the Paris Hotel, so don't expect quiet and leisurely. However the food is serious. 

Even at dinner time they have carts with dim sum. We had steamed pork buns, spring rolls, and pork dumplings. All hot, fresh, and tasty. 

We ordered roasted pork (char shiu) which was good, not great. And dan-dan noodles which were very good. 

The service was attentive and pleasant.  

I would return here."}
{"text":"Very worse place to eat. The server didnt tell me that I will be waiting for 30 mins.for my food. I changed my order and served me something cold and dry. I went back to my old order roast duck.and when it finally came ....it has an after taste. Worse part they want me to pay for my food that i barely ate.Definitely will not go back to this place!!!"}
{"text":"so expensive... And salty and force me to pay tips without telling me in advance?! What do you expect me to say?! I will never ever come here again!"}
{"text":"We didn't get to eat here so I'm not going to be able to comment on the food but my comments are just about the reservation system and the hostess. I made a reservation on Open Table. When our plans changed, I tried to cancel. I could not cancel on the Open Table site, but it did give me a phone number to call Yong Kang Street directly. When I tried to do that, there was a recording that said that the mailbox was full.....\"goodbye\". I didn't want this negative item on my Open Table account so the next day when we were in the area, I stopped at Yong Kang Street to talk to someone. The hostess informed me that they were not taking Open Table reservations, even when I showed her a copy of mine with the confirmation number. She also said that the system was down and she could not fix my reservation. Huh? Are they taking reservations from Open Table or not? I informed her that I tried to cancel my reservation by calling the phone number that was provided and she suggested that I discuss that with the manager. UGH! We won't be eating there, even if it's good if that is the way that they manage things."}
{"text":"Food was really good! The service was not bad too. Will definitely come back for the green onion pancake"}
{"text":"I stayed at Paris for a conference for a week. Nothing special, just a really good, simple meal. My colleague, a friend and I decided to grab a quick bite here one evening prior to going out. We all ordered the \"Chick with Noodles\" dish and we all agreed that it was just terrific. After that we found ourselves eating there repeatedly throughout the week as it was a nice place between a fancy restaurant and the food court (ordered the \"Chicken with Noodles\" each time). Reasonably priced and great service and ambiance too."}
{"text":"Excellent late night noodle and dumplings restaurant. Servers are excellent!! Very friendly and outgoing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is surprisingly delicious. We're vegetarians and they accommodated our requests gladly. The taste is yummy and the service is amazing! Will make this a Vegas regular!
One star taken off for price"}
{"text":"Delicious dim sum and noodle soup! I visit every time I go to Vegas!! Fun atmosphere and great service too!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I don't know why they have such a low rating on yelp bi would normally rate them 4 star but I'm rating 5 to push their rating up. We had BBQ pork fried rice, Mongolian beef noodle and pork/shrimp spicy dumplings.   Everything was delicious. The price was good too considering the prices in Vegas. We left spending just under $50 for two of us."}
{"text":"Wait in line for 20 min and another 30 min for the food to be served. Don't come on a holiday.

Other than that, good service, great food (very authentic Chinese food compared to Americanized Chinese food like Panda Express etc and poorly prepared food in Chinatown). A little pricy but considering the location it's acceptable."}
{"text":"Really good dumplings and the assortment of noodles is great.  Service is great as they make sure you are taken care of"}
{"text":"Friendly and efficient service. Reasonable prices for the Strip. Loved the TenRen's tea and traditional dim sum cart service. Dim sum itself was tasty - most of the traditional dishes there like siu mai, har gow, pork buns, and potstickers. Also ordered the house fried rice, which was okay, but would probably try something else next time. Definitely satisfies Chinese food craving."}
{"text":"Had dinner here. Omg it's not good at all. Shrimp fried rice have raw shrimp, no flavor or whatsoever. Chow mein, is dry, chicken is nasty and no flavor. Dim sum, ordinary and very plain. It's probably the worst dim sum/ Chinese/ Taiwanese restaurant ok the strip we have ever tried. Customer service is bad. Thai tea drink has no flavor, requested for boba and they are out. Not kid friendly. And most of all, it's not worth the price. It's way too pricey for the food and service you get. It's not good at all. Pls don't waste your money going here. Find other place that's good and worth it."}
{"text":"The food was good. But kind of deceiving on prices and the lady that comes around with the carts doesn't speak English ??so we ended up getting charge for something that we said we did not want. There needs to be better information stating how much the food is on the cart for one person to go and eat and cost $70 that's pathetic"}
{"text":"Don't come here. You will get 10% of what you pay for. Servings are extremely small. They food are not that great either. I honestly prefer Panda Express over this fake Hong Kong style restaurant. Their fried rice was very basic. No reason to say, \"wow.\" Soup had a nice presentation but don't let this deceive you. The soup was very salty. The cup of noodles from the grocery stores have better flavor and probably less sodium as well. They did bring out our food pretty quickly. Its nice that someone is always walking around with a cart full of \"fresh\" dim sum. These items were also expensive. Even though we weren't impressed with our food, our server was extremely nice and attentive. She constantly checked on us to see how we were doing. She also made sure that my glass of water was always full. I expected more from this place considering their prices. You're probably better off trying another restaurant. I do not recommend and I will not be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"O EM GEEEE What a tragedy!

I was staying at the Paris and it's the first thing you see just in front of the elevators.

The place looks great, appealing, low key, nice decor. 

Stop. That's it. Overpriced awful food. 

I ordered some sort of noodles with chicken. Nothing tasted good.

My companion ordered vegetable fried rice. How can you mess that up, right? They figured it out. Just make it so salty that tastes like a shot of soy sauce. 

The prices were ridiculous. I don't remember if it was 8 or 12 for a buddha beer. Either way is crazy.

Won't go back.

Cheers."}
{"text":"This restaurant grabbed my attention after we checked into our hotel. Overall, I would saw the decor of the restaurant was far more impressive than the actual food itself. I ordered dumplings and noodles if I remembered correctly, I left unimpressed so my memory is a little blurry. I do recall my main entree having lots of cilantro and I cannot stand the taste of it, so that alone ruined the experience for me. The service was super quick; I was actually astonished seeing our plates delivered within minutes of just ordering. If I just stuck with appetizers and dumplings for the evening I would have enjoyed the meal more."}
{"text":"Very good little Dim Sum restaurant in the Paris hotel, shrimp dumplings, short ribs, roasted duck fried rice were all delish"}
{"text":"I ordered duck fried rice and it was lack of taste but i asked for ginger sauce on the side and that helped a lot. This place is quite expensive so might not come back. Dim sum was very expensive too. Nothing special about this place but if you crave for noodles or asian food, head to Asian Noodle at the Venetian. 

Service was good tho. Water gets refilled from time to time, hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"At 2am, the food is just want the doctor ordered! And the Service was 5 stars by Mike and Ivan. Not sure why they have 3 stars"}
{"text":"The Taiwan beef noodles recommended by the staff was mediocre. It was nothing like the one I had in Taiwan. The noodle was similar to the one used for Hong Kong wonton noodle, so it was really off. We also ordered some dim sum dishes, which were just ok. None of us liked the place. For the price we paid, we should have eaten somewhere else."}
{"text":"In all the times I had been to Vegas and stayed at the Paris, I always wanted to try this place. I finally committed to it and I was not disappointed.

It was 7pm and we were seated immediately, so I wouldn't imagine when it would be busy enough for a long wait to be seated. Our waiter was at our table immediately to take drink orders and brought them quickly. The only negative thing I experienced was after being seated, but before the drinks arrived, two of the cart girls passed over us. The table immediately next to us got served, but we were ignored. Not sure why, but that was the only time it happened.

For a group of four, we ordered noodles and rice off of the menu, and several items from the carts. The vegetable fried rice was a little underwhelming with flavor, but the lo mein noodles were quite good. The only items I didn't like were the chicken feet, not because they were gross, but there was too much work for little meat reward; and the sticky buns, mainly because they were TOO sticky. The paper underneath would not come off without a lot of effort to remove it. Other than that, all of the dim sum dumplings, shu mai, and shrimp tempura were all delicious. For as much as we ordered, four of us getting out of there for about $100 was surprising.

This is definitely a place I'll go back for the affordable price and tastiness of the nice variety of on-demand food. Definitely recommended, especially if you're staying at the Paris and don't want to go out or dress up."}
{"text":"Happy that this place is open til late. I like the decor. My husband and I got the duck but the only thing is it's not worth $20. It was good but not great. The duck wasn't as juicy. Flavor was ehh-okay."}
{"text":"Oddly the best Taiwanese beef noodle soup I've ever had.  For $19 a pop, definitely not cheap, but definitely incredibly tasty.  So much so that I would gladly pay this much money for a bowl again.

(Note: I ate this completely sober, so it's not like it's drunk food)"}
{"text":"Sui Mai was tepid and lacked flavor.  Cha shu was dry.  Egg rolls were tasty.  Lobster noodle soup was tasty.  Pork over rice (as they don't sell traditional fried rice after 10pm) was bland, tepid, and had a mound of shredded raw vegetable over 50 % of the order.  No idea what that was all about.  We were right next to where the waiters congregated.  Took forever to get drinks refreshed after they were offered. $99 wasted dollars.  Never again."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.
Everything is on the expensive side but that's kind of expected where this is.
The dandan noodles are SO GOOD. Seriously get them if you come here. Some of the items they show aren't on the actual menu however.
They forgot to give us one of our orders but when they did they gave us double to make up for it. (: The dimsum is okay.
Overall it's okay."}
{"text":"This place serves up pretty good Dim Sum. There is better in Vegas but this place does it for us. We stay at Paris and Bally's quite often so we are glad to see this place come to Paris. We had a good dining experience so we'll make this a regular Restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"The Hong Kong style Wonton Noodles on the late night menu were fabulous and Mike was an awesome waiter.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The dumplings were okay but everything was very overpriced as everything is on the strip. I also had the noodles with duck and it was not good at all. The noodles were drowned in the peanut sauce and the duck meat was way too salty. I couldn't finish my meal and left the restaurant hungry. I think that happened once to me before. For a 45$ lunch (drinks not included)) for persons it was very disappointing. I would not recommend this place"}
{"text":"We ordered taiwanese shrimp and pork noodle soup and pan fried dumplings.  The food was delicious!  The service was not the most desirable, but the food most definitely made up for it."}
{"text":"The noodles were good, the appetizer cart was pretty impressive with a good variety ready for you to eat! The sushi was terrible. I don't recommend getting sushi.. Service was great also:-)"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to eat After a hangover the pork and Shrimp wonton noodle soup.   So good... then they came around with the cart (dim sum) WHAT omg made my day. Thanks for being there when I needed you. For dim sum I got the bursting wonton.  I forgot the name but if you ask I'm sure they know"}
{"text":"Food was very good.  Authentic Cantonese style food with a good selection of dim sum.  Tempura shrimp was excellent, very fresh.  Chicken with ginger over rice was very good also.  Not American Chinese food at all.  

Good, friendly service also.  Right on walkway thru Paris shoppes."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with amazing dim sum would give this place a 5 star rating but if your a seafood lover like myself, you might try the lobster fried rice and realize that dim sum is the way to go.  Literally everything else is amazing, however at $23 the lobster fried rice will underwhelm you.  Trust me save the money for some great dim sum and leave with every taste bud pleased."}
{"text":"Bachelorette party madness. Michael was quick and extremely helpful. Food was tasty. Ordered loads of food from menu and dim sum. Thank you."}
{"text":"Had dinner here today Tues Mar 29, 2016 at 8:30pm and like most restaurants in the Strip, it was overpriced. The Beef with Sukiyako over rice was disappointing. I thought it would be seasoned better.

The waitress failed to make eye contact with me, the one who was footing the bill, but made eye contact with the other two in my party. She did not receive a tip from me."}
{"text":"Food is not very good. I felt overpriced but it is Vegas and inside Paris Casino. I gave 20 percent tip for having hot green tea in the morning."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Seated at 11pm on a Wednesday night. After 35 minutes, 1 glass of water, and one small item from the dim sum cart, I left, frustrated at the lack of adequate staffing and generally unfriendly staff."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to have a quick bite. I had the beef fried rice. The flavor was good but not as memorable. The fried rice wasn't oily like some fried rice I've had so that's a plus. The pork sumai was delish tho. The service was good as well even though I had to ask for a refill on my drink before I choked on my food. The price was a bit absurd but the area and venue was nice."}
{"text":"#7 Dandan noodles were ok. Little flour taste to then. Over all ok. The manager shoved me and called me am asshole after waiter spilled and broke glasses on the person I was dinning with!  He could use some anger management courses."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Horrible service. Disgusting atmosphere. Don't come here. Save yourself the trouble and go down the street anywhere else. Do not get the chicken ginger rice. The chicken is served cold and the rice is hard and old. Steamed veggies are filled with oil. The chicken noodle spicy was not spicy at all. It was just salty ramen packets. The wonton soup was served cold. If we were not all starving we wouldn't have are a single thing. Half the food was sent back. Avoid this place. Slow service."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad - but of course dim sum that's just \"ok\" is still good to me. it's like have you ever REALLY had bad pizza? all pizza is good, just like all dim sum is good. I only had the dim sum off the carts, and it was all tasty, but not as good as I've had back home in San Antonio (I realize how that sounds). but it's true, back home Golden Wok is better flavored/seasoned, and the only reason I gave this place 3 stars is because of the expense. about twice the price as better dim sum at home. however, atmosphere is really cool, service was great, food was well-cooked, and it was clean. Be warned however, an iced tea is $5."}
{"text":"Loved the decoration of the place! The dim sum tasted good but presentation was poor. They had one cart rolling around to serve dim sum. Beef noodle soup wasn't bad, but $18 was actually kind of crazy for how average it was. Also, they put jalapenos and iceberg lettuce on top, which was very confusing (although the jalapenos did add nice flavor)"}
{"text":"Darn. I thought I left a review. Any hoo. Not recommending this place. Should have read reviews first. I had the Vietnamese Chicken Pho.......the chicken was definitely frozen first. Lol. Maybe from Tysons frozen chicken bag. My husband's chicken fried chicken....tasted burnt.  Again from frozen chicken. All restaurants from Paris so far gave been great. Not so mych this place. Better places to spend your hard earned vacation money for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"After getting robbed at some 'high end' places I convinced my friends to give it a shot it was in our hotel and smelled good. I am now currently the savior and we have plans to eat here again tomorrow before our flights. Good dim sum, loved the pork and shrimp, great duck and noodles soups. I've been to China and we all know it's gonna be slightly Americanized but overall was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"What?! $15 for Won Ton Mein?! $19 for Taiwan Beef Noodle Soup?!  $6 for two Char Siu Bao?!  Are they NUTS?! 
Won Ton Noodle Soup - broth was good, though not enough for the amount of noodles given; won ton was tasty - only given 3 pcs, and are not Shrimp.
Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup - fair, of course, and no where as delish as on the streets of Taiwan. 
No free tea here!  And not even loose leaf tea! $4/pot. 
Unless I'm dying of hunger, I'll pass this restaurant on my next visit."}
{"text":"OK, is it me or is it just not possible to get a good meal at the Paris Hotel?  Second place I have eaten at (Mon Ami Gabi was the first) at Paris, and just not good.

Started with vegetarian spring rolls - two whole rolls (wow) smaller than a $5 roll of dimes.  Can you spare it?  And then on to Taiwanese Style Beef Noodle Soup - Campells anyone?  Thin soup, not spicy at all and three pieces of meat that seemed to be leftovers from parts not used for any other meal, including pet food.  

Our waitress had trouble understanding what vegetarian means, my dining partner has to explain several times before finding the one item that was vegan on the menu.  Slow service, inattentive staff and just not a good experience."}
{"text":"If you're hungry and wondering around after a show between Paris and Bally's this place serves food. The prices are a little steep, but that's to be expected on the strip. Honestly, there are better places for Dim Sum off the strip. I ordered iced green tea and spicy shrimp won tons. My green tea came in a cold can and cost almost $5. I thought it would be freshly brewed and iced, not in a can. The shrimp won tons were okay at best. There were six on my plate and it cost me $12. Honestly they tasted like frozen food from Costco. The food was palatable, but barely. For the price and being on the strip my expectations were high, but I was really let down. My friend ordered beef over rice and took two bites and couldn't eat anymore, she said it was disgusting."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a casual, nice Chinese restaurant on the strip, and realized that now Yong Kang Street Dumpling & Noodle House opened recently. Probably the first place to offer Dim Sum on the strip?

We had several Dim Sum items, Taiwanese beef noodle and fried rice. Hmm I have to say, Ping Pang Pong at Gold Coast was better for Dim Sum. Quality was on par but selection is very limited here and of course the price was way higher. Taiwanese beef noodle was far from what I enjoyed in Taiwan. Fried rice? I'll pass.

Rather disappointed, but I would still leave 3 stars, for the unique proposition on the strip. We need more like this one."}
{"text":"Great casual place in Paris Casino for lunch or a late bite. Highly recommend the Taiwanese beef noodle soup!  The dim sum itself was ok but still good.  A good place to go if you are craving Asian noodles/fried rice or dim sum."}
{"text":"We had a late lunch at Yong Kang Street. 
My boyfriend got the lobster fried rice and I had the BBQ pork fried rice. He added something spicy and I added duck sauce. It was the perfect amount of food and tasted great.
The best part was the Steamed Pork Dumplings. Freshly made and tasted amazing. 
Great, friendly service."}
{"text":"Not sure why this doesn't have better reviews. Great noodle soup and dim sum in carts and all served until 3am. Fantastic!!

Was hungry after a night out at the Cosmo and was craving some noodle soup. Looked up where would still be open at 2am and found this place. Rocked in there at 2:30am and got seated. Ordered noodle soup but the dim sum cart was still going around for anyone that wanted it. 

My husband got the wonton noodle soup and said it was good. A few big wontons and a ton of noodles. I had the BBQ pork noodle soup and it was great. Exactly what I was looking for. Lots of noodles and a decent amount of meat. 

I will definitely be coming back here next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"this food is really good i am not a huge fan of new food places but this place is great. love the service. i recommend the wonton soup and pork dumplings"}
{"text":"Love this place. Never miss it anytime I'm in Vegas. Best place to eat a light lunch. Soup is awesome! I love the chicken clear soup with udon noodles. They don't deserve just 3 stars. Very good place. Hang over? Go get some soup, dim sum and dumplings"}
{"text":"Mikey is a GREAT server! Most definitely recommend this place. Really fast, easy, and good!  Recommend Dim Sum here as well! Thanks for the good service."}
{"text":"Cool looking new restaurant street feel and service was decent BUT food was disappointing less than average. Def not worth it for the price I will not be coming back
Food was not flavorful ..... Its specialty is dumplings and noodles and we ordered both but not impressive"}
{"text":"I'm in Las Vegas and found a gem, Yong Kang Street at Paris Hotel & Casino. Great location, across from the Paris hotel elevators. The decor makes you feel like you are sitting on a patio and being able to watch many people passing by. The food.......dim sum carts, noodle soup, fried rice and more! We were 6 people and got a sampling from each section and shared. Great Taiwanese style beef soup!! The servers were fun and interactive too. I will return! Thanks."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  I had the egg  noodle soup with shrimp which was delicious.  My husband had dim sum and tried the shrimp dumplings and spring rolls.  Great variety and options with a reasonable price.  Our bill was around $40."}
{"text":"Descending down from my room, I was constantly greeted by this street market inspired venue tucked away in the Paris hotel. Sitting next to a sake bomb bar and some sushi place, Yong Kang and its giant paper lanterns stood out from the rest.

Overall the food was very typical of what you find in a Vegas restaurant - slightly overpriced food served in a area that is incredibly decorated. If i would have to guess, if feels like Vegas venues spend more time and attention to the set design of the restaurant to mask the so so quality of the food.

A few things did make this place stand out from the sea of food options. The top one being the great attitude and service of our waiter (FenFen C). She made sure to check in on our table, refill our drinks, and get out our entrees as soon as they were ready.

I would highly recommend coming here for the Dim Sum cart. yes its more expensive than your typical Dim Sum back home, but so is everything else in Vegas. They tended to have more options of Dim Sum, and the fact that there is zero wait is really great."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a noodle bar at 1:00 a.m. after a bushel of adult beverages?  I had the BBQ pork noodle soup paired with an Asahi draft, which was tasty and fueled me to push forward on my journey in the wee hours of the morning on the Strip.  This is good stuff.  Yong Kang Street is wisely open until 3:00 a.m."}
{"text":"Typical Americanized Chinese food, but not too bad. 
Fried rice dishes are not recommended if you want to try some real Chinese food.
The other dishes were just mediocre."}
{"text":"Mike was Awesome! He made us feel at home at this restaurant! The dim sum and soup was amazing! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Oh what a night!  A group of 6 of us arrived in Vegas and came after an event.  We were Starving!  wanted a good, but decently priced buffet and Yelp brought me to the Paris casino.  This was about 9pm and the line at the buffet snaked around like a Disneyland ride. It was very tough to gauge since part of the line was hidden behind walls.   Half of us were willing to wait while the other half said the noodles smelled great and there was no wait.  They won and here we came.    They service dim sum, noodles, and rice.  Service was good but it should be since 18% Gratuity is added unto parties of 6 or more.  There are a lot of funky named things on the menu we had to ask about and Im asian!  I ordered the Duck fried rice since I rarely get to have duck.  For $18 I expected a good sized bowl but it was rather small so I had to get some dim sum.  It is true dim sum where the roll around the carts.  Selection wasn't great but got some Har-gow at the tune of $2.00 EACH!  My rice was quite tasty I must admit.  My friend ordered some sesame noodle plate and it was oddly gritty.  But someone else got duck noodle soup that was delicious. 
I would probably give a 4 but it was SO expensive for what you got, that it drops down a star.  It can easily be $25-30 per person but for a noodles?  My rice was good enough that I would return but no dim sum or drinks this time! lol"}
{"text":"My family and I always enjoy staying at Paris hotel and casino. This restaurant has a very inviting decor but much is needed in the running and operating a restaurant. I own and operate restaurants and never have I seen such poor hosting service. The ladies you have in the front are obviously clueless at hosting. Two ladies just looking at us like deer in headlights. I understand coming as a party of 7 takes longer than seating 2 or 3. But the option for us to be seated separately and sooner should have been given to us. Instead the hostess just keep seating everyone that came after us. After waiting more than 35 minutes we just had it. Advice to this establishment change your hostess ladies before they really chase everyone.  Hostesses are your first impression to how your shop runs even before the food. So take some advice and have your hostesses learn some proper etiquette to hosting guests. No one likes to be treated in this manner. It's Vegas and you guys are in a big casino you have to have your A GAME on. Please avoid all this restaurant all together. Don't waste your Vegas time with this place."}
{"text":"Not true Taiwanese food from Yong Kang..  but a mix between Taiwanese, Cantonese, Japanese and lots of alcohol.   It is pretty pricey, but worth it if you want authentic good  Taiwanese/Cantonese/Japanese food.   

I recommend the Taiwanese beef soup noodles!"}
{"text":"Review is on late night menu.   

Perfect place to go when you're in the mood for food late night for both Ballys and Paris.   Prices are pretty much what u can expect for Vegas but the noodles were prepared well and authentic."}
{"text":"I'm half Japanese and half Chinese, grew up with great chinese food from Sacramento to SF. This place is authentic and yummy!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for dim sum on the strip this is the place to go. Service is friendly and food was very good. Did not order any menu items just picked off the dim sum cart.  They have both steamed and fried options that were all amazing. A go to in Vegas for Dim Sum!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food! I love their dim sum and noodle soup.  Must try when you visit Paris Hotel. Taiwanese beef noodle soup and wonton noodle is the best! Also the pan fried dumplings are juicy and crispy."}
{"text":"Just spent 4 days at Bally's and ate here twice.  Great food, the spicy dumplings on the menu are amazing.  Great noodles.  Service was fast and efficient. Was open late, which made it a great place to get a late night bite after losing at cards.  I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"In A Nutshell:

-Yong Kang Street really looks like a restaurant on the streets of Taipei.
-The decor & signage are pretty realistic, very cool how they designed it, especially being inside the Paris Casino Hotel.
-With that being said, the food was just average.
-Nothing really stuck out, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't mouth-watering good or worthy of a longer review.

Overall, it's still nice to have Taiwanese food as an option in a French-themed hotel."}
{"text":"Mediocre quality of food. It is an appropriate place for a late night snack, but I would not recommend it if you are looking for all-out dim sum. Service could have been better."}
{"text":"So bummed.
Only vegan(?) option: spring rolls.

We went to several dumpling-serving restaurants while in Las Vegas and NONE had even a vegetarian dumpling. I wouldn't be so sad, but there were several reviews of Yong Kang Street, that stated otherwise. Upon arrival, and after explaining what \"vegan\" meant to their staff (who should know that term already), we were informed there were no real vegan options at all. 
As they had no options for anyone who isn't omnivorous, I can't review their food. My review is solely based on:
Decor,
Server & staff knowledge,
Wait time,
Clarity of menu (mostly written in Taiwanese),
Not wanting to only give one star."}
{"text":"Had the best vegetable soup  has such good flavor i will definitely be back for more and we had great service by mike made sure we were taken care of the whole time!!"}
{"text":"Hotel restaurants don't ever really appeal to me but this place is a must-try! We ordered the roasted duck & bbq pork noodle soup and got the steamed sticky rice & bbq pork buns from the cart. The flavors were all def there & the food just hits the spot! We'll be visiting everyday while we're here... ps. The Vietnamese coffee is awesome too!"}
{"text":"If you need a helping of dim sum?, this is not a bad place to go. I came in the morning and the service was excellent. The food was decent ?but too expensive for the amount you recieved. 

I had the short ribs, sticky shrimp balls, pot stickers, and a variety of other types? of dumplings. As you can see, other than the short ribs, all I ate were different types of dumplings. Yes, they were appetizing and I recommend? ordering these dishes, but I expected more options from the dim sum menu. Additionally, the limited amount in each dish can put a hole in your wallet, so hopefully, ?you win big at the casino to make up for your loss here.  

The atmosphere is nicely decorated and full of life. With the convenience? of being located in the Paris casino, I would probably return if I really wanted some dim sum in Sin City."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites places in vegas everytime I'm in town I have to come here  waiting for the lady with the dumpling cart makes everything more exiting, order some luckybuddha now one of my favs beers! Crew super friendly I always order what they really like from the menu 'cause they know is good. I just in love with this place"}
{"text":"Great service. I love the ginger sauce. The fried rice was extra tasty. I had to minus a point for the heavy peanut sauce in the Dan Dan noodles. I recommend the crab that is deep fried that comes on the cart. I don't know what it's called, but it was perfect."}
{"text":"Shrimp Wintons to die for! Same for Shanghai Lo Mein and Steamed Dumplings. Great service. And really cook chop sticks."}
{"text":"This dumpling house, while super enticing on the outside, leaves much to be desired. It is rather expensive, even for Las Vegas standards, and the food quality doesn't match the price by any means. The dumplings were tasty enough, but sparse and  lukewarm (there were only 3 and it cost $7.88). The beef in the Taiwanese noodle soup was gristly, fatty, and chewy. The pork in the pork over rice was practically non-existent. I will not be coming back. I really should have looked at Yelp before coming here. Unfortunately it's situated right off the elevators, so it caught my eye while heading to the casino. One strong drink later and this spot seemed like the best option for a late night craving, but was quite the opposite. I'm pretty disappointed, mostly because it cost way too much for less than mediocre food."}
{"text":"This place was easy to get in . The dimsum was cold . We ordered the Dan Dan noodles.   Which was way overcooked.  The food came quickly  but it was expensive . I would not go back . Dim sum needs to be piping hot."}
{"text":"The Yong Kang Street is a convenient spot inside the Paris hotel with tasty Asian food, good service and really cute decor. We grabbed a late night bite to go, and definitely appreciated that there was a place where we could get a meal that didn't taste like fast food at midnight. 

The food itself was ok, but not the best noodle soup I've ever had, either. Thus the 3 stars. 

Would I go back? Yes. Mostly for the convenience, but also because I know that their food tastes good and the service is also good. I think I'd rather have a sit down meal, to enjoy the decor and ambiance, instead of just doing take out."}
{"text":"Walking threw the casino looking for some late dinner. Decided to randomly give this place a try. My husband and I were surprise at how much favor everything we order had. 
We will be returning for those pork & shrimp dim sum! Yum yum"}
{"text":"Maybe they should specify one order with one free drink if you're checking on yelp. No wonder they are only three star around this area. The attitude of the manager is suck he should be fired"}
{"text":"I ate there twice when we recently stayed at The Paris Hotel.
We had both the pork and the duck Udon stir fried noodles. They were very good. Loved the duck especially.  
We also had the pork dumplings. To be honest, I found them comparable to the ones I can buy at Trader Joe's and I know I can better sear on the dumpling than they did. 
The food is good, but overpriced because of the location. I would eat there again when we stay there next time."}
{"text":"Most terrible food I've ever had!
Too expensive for one dish!
Can't believe 5.99 for just one small size milk tea.
I am a typical Chinese and I swear food here are not good. We spent 150dollars on our breakfast and not  full up(three adults)
????????????8??????
?????????????
?????????????????????????
??????????????"}
{"text":"Average food and although rhe service was okay we had to wait 10 minutes for a bowl of white rice that we ordered."}
{"text":"So surprised that they only had 3 stars and most of the negative reviews I can tell those ppl are really picky ..
 I was walking by this place at midnight , they seated me really fast and dim sum cart comes real quick , unbelievable they still have dim sum at midnight , and the server was really helpful , exactly explained menu on point . I tried Taiwanese beef noodle what they highly recommended, it was full of flavor , and dim sum was more than 20 choices , everything I had was amazing fresh and taste good .. little bit pricey but it is reasonable , when you are really hungry at cold midnight can eat some fast hot and yummy food on the strip casinos . Definitely will come back here when I come to Paris again . Last thing if the noodle could add more it will be perfect !"}
{"text":"We ate here today. YUM! We knew nothing about Dim Sum I think it was called, where a cart comes by and you pick food you would like! It was so amazing and all the ladies were very helpful. We also ordered some pork and noodles. Everything was fantastic tasting!"}
{"text":"Look for Mike he's the best! Great Soup! Great Service! Great Place! Friendly people and really fast service... This place is great if u're really really hungry."}
{"text":"Pro's: Half decent noodles, Cool setting
Con's: Horrible frozen dim sum, terrible value

Food: The noodles here are surprisingly half decent, the ramen had a rich broth and the noodles had a nice al dente texture. The Hong Kong Won Ton noodle soup was also pretty good. The dim sum is HORRIBLE, just avoid it. Its cheap frozen crap steamed in the back then thrown on carts. 

If you're craving Asian this is a good quick fix in a cool faux Asian / Parisian setting. Unfortunately the convenience and setting come with a really hefty premium for what you actually get, the value proposition is terrible."}
{"text":"Ordered a little bit of everything!  Great food if you're in the mood for asian.  Seems like they make their own fresh noodles.  The chicken in the fried rice and chicken tasted a little rubbery but I wasn't too salty or greasy so it's allll good.  My favorite had to be the fried pancake, the dipping sauce was really good!"}
{"text":"Too expensive for medium quality food. You can find better places that offer dim sum. China and poblano in the cosmopolitan is a great place. You get higher quality for the same price. If convenience is your motivation for coming here, then it's fine. I know everything is Vegas is more expensive. Why not pay more for quality? It makes a difference."}
{"text":"Good casual Asian food option on the Strip in Paris -- closer to 3.5*.  The spicy Taiwanese beef noodle soup is pretty tasty, with plenty of beef and a spice that seems mild at first but builds.  The chili dumplings are good as well but pretty overpriced at $10.88 for six.  Items from the dim sum cart are forgettable, and the wonton noodle soup is bland, leading to the low review.  That said, I would happily come again for the beef noodle soup."}
{"text":"The hargow and chicken feet with the lobster fried rice was amazing. friendly and attentive service!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my spot for comfort food in Vegas.  There's always a pleasant person to greet you and you get seated immediately.   

As always, my husband got his favourite Dan Dan noodles.   I always get couple of different proteins from the Dim Sum tray and steamed rice.   

We love Chinese beer (not very strong) and ordered a bottle of Tsingtao and a bottle of Lucky Buddha.  Both were delicious!

My sauteed beef over squash and shrimp/crap on a sugarcane drumstick were delicious!  There's something about a mix of the spicy, salty and sweet that just hits the spot!

I also checked in on Yelp and they gave an iced tea which was delicious!!

Overall it's a great place to relax and enjoy a meal.  It's not a fancy place and it's kind of like eating street food in China.  I guess that's part of it's charm.  

If you're looking for good food and a comfortable place to rest away from the gambling scene, this is great place.

It's located inside Paris.  By the towers entry."}
{"text":"Our server \"Joe\" said we had to leave a good review about him to redeem our \"free drink\" for checking in. I'm sure they will continue to be paying the insane amount to Yelp yearly to keep all the bad reviews off. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be working as they are still three stars despite trying to scam their guests. Won't be paying $20 for a $5 bowl of noodles anymore thanks to their dirty business tactics. Plan backfired!"}
{"text":"Great place and good street style vibe. Hong Kong Wonton Noodle Soup was excellent as well as the dumpling cart. Mike was the best server"}
{"text":"A lot of negative reviews here...

I didn't think the food was bad, I actually enjoyed my meal.  The dim sum cart is a cool feature and they have a cool atmosphere, it really feels like you're on the streets of a foreign country.  The fact they can pull off that kind of environment is a plus in my book.  

We had some egg rolls, dim sum and shrimp something while sitting at the table waiting for our food.  None of them were more spectacular than something from Pei Wei or Leann Chin in my opinion.  For my entree I ordered some combination of beef and broccoli with rice and had no complaints.  I did stay in my comfort zone though, if I could do it again I might try something I don't usually order since everything coming out appeared good.  Sake was served cold and so was the beer, altogether it wasn't too expensive either, solid choice..."}
{"text":"I only had a quick minute on my lunch to try Yong Kang Street - so I stuck to their pre-made dim sum. In all honesty, even if I had time I likely would have eaten the dim sum because it is one of my favorite foods of life. I sat by the gate and while having passerbys watch you while you eat isn't my favorite atmosphere being squished between that and lanterns/Chinese-esque decor on my right was nice for a short time. 

The taste of all the food was good. I got pork shu mai, soup dumplings, sticky rice in a banana leaf, and fried crab/shrimp puffs. Everything was comparable to other favorite dum sum locations like KJ in the Rio and Yum Cha. The only thing that I didn't eat was the fried crab/shrimp puffs because I didn't know when I ordered it that they wouldn't have mayo to dip it in. I've never been to a place that didn't automatically provide mayo with puffs like that. This place gave me a sweet and sour sauce that I would not recommend. 

Lastly, it's expensive. I didn't knock off any stars for this because - duh -it's located in the Paris on the strip. I paid $40 for 4 different plates and an iced green tea. At a local place this lunch might have cost $20. I didn't feel ripped off though because the service, food, and atmosphere were pretty good. I'd come back for a quick lunch but I am not running out to the strip just to eat here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Overpriced and disappointing. Better off spending a few extra bucks and getting noodles at a buffet! Service wasn't the friendliest either!"}
{"text":"This cute little place, the food is good and they seem to have an all day Dim Sum. Good service, fun location for people watching. 
Nothing too crazy... Prices are decent considering location.  
Some of the portions are massive. (lol) I didn't try too much food the day I came in but everything was pretty good the place was clean."}
{"text":"Not a good place, the foods temperature wasn't  hot enough. The servers are rude and expect a big tips."}
{"text":"I had high hopes considering they were boasted to be one of the first to do dim sum carts on the strip. It's not a very big place, but they only had two with a small assortment of dumplings, shumai, some pork ribs, and a small variety of the deep friend items. I got one of the steamed sticky rice wrapped in the banana leaf. There was little meat and the flavoring was off. I only tasted the 5 spice and star anise. I had also ordered their wonton soup, but ended up canceling the order because they forgot to make it. My friends had also ordered the bbq platter which had bbq pork and roast duck. Those were pretty good. Their lobster fried rice was not what we were expecting. It was pricey for fried rice topped with some lobster meat. Overall a 3 because the service other than my missing order was good. It's a bit pricey for just ok."}
{"text":"Good food and customer service from the hostess to our server.  We placed our order for the house fried rice and juicy dumplings and we got some dim sum while we waited.  By the time we finished our dim sum (which was perfect - not over cooked as most places are) our food came.  We enjoyed both and will probably come again next time in Vegas.  :)"}
{"text":"It's really surprising how bad this place is considering how good it all looks. Everything is severely overpriced for what you get. We came here the morning after celebrating my birthday on the Strip, so we were trying you cure our huge hangovers. To me, this usually means that I stop becoming picky with food and eat everything in sight, but I couldn't even stomach what I bought. There's only one dimsum cart roaming around the place, and the cheapest thing you can get from it was like $7 with a typical dimsum serving size. Siomai was dry and nothing special; rice was too dry to eat with chopsticks and felt hard. My friends ordered some sort of chicken over rice bowl. It was apparently bland and soggy, and it was definitely not worth the $15 they spent. I bought 3 things off the dimsum cart and spent $30 (read: ridiculous).

Conclusion: Pass. Go to Chinatown for much better dimsum. It's like 10 min from the strip.

{"text":"A solid 3 stars.
Competent dumplings, but variety could be wider.
I just wish the soups weren't so stupidly priced."}
{"text":"Its gross! Their dim sum is nasty and hard! Their noodle soups are so so. Not that great."}
{"text":"Convenient location for dim sum on the strip. Dim sum was hot and fresh. The Taiwanese beef noodle soup was great to cure a hangover too. There was plenty of meat in the soup."}
{"text":"Delicious soup! Hits the spot and filled with yummy veggies! Even had the pork dumplings and shrimp dumplings from the cart. Friendly Asian servers! My 2nd time eating the HK soup with BBQ pork in the 3 days I've been here!"}
{"text":"Mehhh...
Why did we choose to eat chinese inside the paris hotel? WRONG move. 
But we were craving asian food, and it was convenient. So we did take out and brought it up to our room.
Maybe because we have an abundance of extremely delicious chinese food in LA, and my palate has uped it's game in recent years, but this Yong Kang Street Dim Sum spot was ....=P
The shrimp fried rice wasn't bad but everything else, i wasn't digging it. 
The place was always packed though with a long line to get a table. They were killing it"}
{"text":"Service was good. I didn't like the spicy Taiwanese noodle soup. It was too greasy and didn't have much flavor. The beef was tender, though. I liked the crab ball dim sum. Inside is crab claw with shrimp on the outside, deep fried. So good! I took a couple bites of the taiwanese beef noodle and let the server know it was too oily and didn't want it. It was taken off of my bill with no hesitation. That is appreciated. The ramen noodles were alright as well. I wouldn't come back for their noodle soup as it's not very authentic. But their dim sum was good from what I ordered even though it was one item. I would come back to try more of their dim sum"}
{"text":"We ate here a couple of times while staying at Paris and the food was good both times, the Singapore noodles were prepared well, not too greasy like they often get, and the dumplings off the cart were decent for an American restaurant.  A Vegas casino restaurant is not usually going to be as good as that small family place down the street due to their scale, but this one was good.  The only complaint I would make is limited choice on the dim sum carts and that they spent more time talking than wheeling around so they were leaving money on the table. Mind you the dim sum dishes can add up if you have a few.

Other people have complained about rudeness but the staff were polite to us."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with dim sum when you're so hungry and need fooooood now! The dim sum carts have your favorite dim sum to choose from! So we ate at the Beer Park outside, well we tried to eat there and it was awful!!!!! A waste of $110!!!!! We didn't eat our food, paid our bill then came here. All their dumplings were hot, yummy and tasty. And we got full! Our server was very nice:) 
We knew we should've came here in the first place but wanted to eat outside since it was so beautiful. What a disappointment that was. Cold food! 
Glad we decided to come here after making that mistake! 
Next time I stay at the Paris I will return. 
If you're looking for a quick dinner, come here! Otherwise I recommend the Pair tower restaurant! Their food is phenomenal."}
{"text":"We ate here twice over the course of three days. That should speak volumes for any who know me and my reviews, as we like to try as many new things as possible when traveling. 

We were actually trying to make our way to the quick-serve crepe window down the \"street\", but my cousin and I both saw the sign for this restaurant at the same time, and were immediately intrigued. 

Walking over to the hostess stand, we saw a couple ladies pushing dim sum carts, and made the decision to eat there. My husband had to join us, but I don't think he minded so much. 

Our first time here, we were trying to snack only, as we planned on dining at the Bacchanal buffet for a late lunch. So it was with that thought in mind that we sat down to snack on a few items from the dim sum carts. 

Let me just pause here to say that the dining area is kind of small, and not really conducive to having several carts pushed around, like you'd expect from a dim sum restaurant. And, though they give you a menu that lists the items you can find within the carts - from Group A on down to Group D - we only ever had carts B and C come our way. And the only reason we knew what cart letter they were is because of where the server placed the stamps. 

At any rate, day one was all dim sum, shared between the three of us. We grabbed a few soup dumplings, some shrimp shumai, sticky rice, fried shrimp balls and bbq pork buns. 

You know...snacking. 

Everything was very good. Our favorite, though, was the soup dumplings. Especially paired with the vinegar (not the normal white vinegar, and careful on the pour, it comes out quick!)

Our second time there, the hubs decided he wanted a noodle dish, so my cousin and I shared a handful of dim sum, hubby got ramen, and I got a fried noodle dish for us all to share. 

The dim sum this time around was more of the same (since soup dumplings are delicious!) My husband liked his ramen, which was good because he wasn't too thrilled with my cousin and me for suggesting this restaurant two days in a row. The fried noodles were excellent, with a great flavor to the sauce and a ton of fresh vegetables tossed in. Definitely enough to share, and to fill us up. 

The servers we had on both days were friendly and efficient. The first one told us that dim sum is served starting at ten, so show up when the craving hits!"}
{"text":"Inside the Paris Hotel (10am-3am)
Order from the menu or the carts of dim sum being pushed around
Beautiful atmosphere that accomplished the street effect
Extremely overpriced but expected for a places on the strip 

Overall, I recommend the Taiwanese style beef soup ($21)! The broth is very tasty and the meat melts in your mouth. However, with the amount I'm paying, I would hope the meal would at least have me leaving full by the end of the meal."}
{"text":"My reliable go-to Asian food joint on the Strip. Prices are a bit expensive for Chinese food but very reasonable for Strip food pricing.  Staff has been consistently friendly--most speak Mandarin. Dim sum at all hours.  There isn't a gigantic dim sum menu but all the classics are there:  shumai, shrimp dumplings, egg rolls, fried dumplings, etc.  My favorite dish is the Hong Kong won ton noodle soup. Very tasty, classic Chinese food--fresh bok choy & generous tasty won tons. Their Taiwan beef noodle soup is also a classic and delicious--savory generous portions."}
{"text":"My first time here and must say it was really delicious. My server Mike suggested all the right item. Japanese miso ramen with the Thai ice tea. Broth was flavorful. Portion is good enough to keep you full. Service and food was spectacular thanks to my server."}
{"text":"The dumplings are great however the chicken used is precooked from the ones frozen that they sell in grocery stores I told the waiter to change it for pork since it was fresh he was really nice and changed it.  A little bit pricey but good for late night munchies."}
{"text":"We have 3 people, and we were not hungry that much so we only ordered a few dishes. They automatically charge 18% gratuity when we check."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of asian restaurant and the food here tasteless for the price at least the dim sum is ok but still over priced.  Service charge is immediately added for group of 5 at 18 percent when service is awful.   I think Paris Hotel should evaluate this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is horrible, extremely salty and expensive, reason for bad rating. I arrived late from airport and were hungry and came here. 2 days later I knew there was a food court downstairs on Ballys open until 3am, where you can go straight from the Paris boulevard until the end, then use the electrical stairs down, much better option.
The only good thing was the hot jasmine tea. The waiter Ivan is great and very nice."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place is overpriced. The food isn't anything grand, and I know for a fact I can get better tasting food for a lower price down in Arcadia. I expected this place to be better because of the crowded wait and the (one) dim sum cart rolling around. It's better to wait longer for good places like Mon Ami than to resort to here.

Edit/Add: I forgot to mention that the lobster fried rice barely had any lobster on it as well (maybe 2 or 3 small pieces on top? It wasn't even mixed into the rice)! Be wary if you're going to try that out."}
{"text":"Taste is not bad. Yet, I am not extremely impressed either. Price is high. I have no issue with paying for great quality/taste, yet, Yong Kang Street does not deliver what I expected. Also, staffs are not well trained enough to understand English."}
{"text":"The hostess and waiter were nice but the waiter was not very attentive, he just showed up when he saw an empty plate to give us our check. 
Our food didn't come out at the same time, my friend is vegetarian so she got stir fried veggies and a side of rice and I got shrimp tempura udon. Right after we ordered, her rice came out, about 5 minutes later, my udon and then a few minutes later her veggies finally came out, resulting in cold rice.
We wanted to try the dim sum cart as well but the two carts only passed once and the people pushing the cart both looked at us (I made eye contact both times) and then continued on looking forward like they never saw us. Everyone else had dim sum and looked happy with it, so I assume it was good.
Both our dishes were heavily salted but otherwise OK (besides being way over priced, but it's Vegas).
I was hoping for the experience to be a bit better."}
{"text":"Finally, an Asian noodle bar and dim sum in the Paris.  Located in the hall of shops and restaurants connecting Paris and Bally's is a welcomed addition.  I didn't try the dim sum, but instead went with the Asian noodle soup.  It wasn't the best, but it was good enough for me to try again, if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"So expensive. The taste was just fine (actually, it's below average if it was in Taiwan). I can find this in Taiwan with only 1/10 price. I know this is Las Vegas but still the food just not worth the price. I'm a Taiwanese. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Coming from san francisco bay area where there are awesome thai and vietnamese places, we were disappointed. 

Food is bland with occasional strange aftertaste. 

Will not come back."}
{"text":"Our server Mike is amazing! He gave us great recommendations on food and drinks. Also! He's so funny! Made our bachelorette trip amazing!"}
{"text":"Food tasted fine but nothing to rave about. Ordered something with duck and it was all bones with no meat. Everything we ordered was mostly rice and very little meat. Waste of money. Spent too much and left hungry."}
{"text":"Servers are ok and they show their annoyed face when they dislike your presence. 
Noodles are ok too. Wonton, duck and pork bbq (asado) has the same broth, and noodles. Their noodles are thin so u can taste the crunch every bite. Broth is rich but with the noodles it seamed bland. For the beef, their noodles are slightly thick because the broth is also slightly thick. Wonton was the least favorable. 
I like how their shrimp ball is coated with rice. Thats new for me. Dimsum wasn't that hot as well as the noodles. 
 Note: party of 6 or more will be charged 18% more."}
{"text":"This place uses only sugar and salt to flavor their food. Not my favourite but it's edible"}
{"text":"Just had some great ramen at the MSP airport on my way to Vegas, but what the heck, I can't turn down good noodles...the dim sum cart is top notch and the ramen was damn tasty."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Chinese restaurant in Vegas. Rice does not come with dishes and costs $4 a small bowl. The rice that we got is hard as small rocks and lukewarm, like it's been left in the open air for awhile. The servers are slow, not especially friendly, and not too knowledgeable about the dishes. You cannot use any comps for this place neither. All in all, worst experience ever in Vegas. They probably could have save this space for a gift shop and be a more positive experience."}
{"text":"Food was good but a bit on the pricey side. Ambiance was good and not to noisy. The only thing i dont like about the place is that they let people eat in their resto even shirtless..i know its vegas but c'mon, pls ask your guest to be dress accordingly and dont let people eat shirtless!!!"}
{"text":"I was here with 3 other adults plus a child.   Our brunch dim sum ended being
over $100.  Talk about being expensive.

Service was excellent and food quality was not bad.  My only complaint is
dim sum menu selection is very limited, we wished they had more variety.

If you are staying in Paris Hotel and don't feel like leaving the hotel for some
Chinese food, this place will do."}
{"text":"After a few days of straight American food we were in some serious need of some asian cuisine. Someone recommended that we come here. We started with some dim sum. It was all pretty decent, a little over priced but hey we're in a casino, what do you expect. I ordered the duck noodle soup since I was feeling a little under the weather. It was decent for a run of the mill Chinese place  catering to all people. Better than what you would get at a random take out place but not quite comparable to an authentic restaurant in Chinatown. It satisfied our cravings without having to leave the strip."}
{"text":"Delicious food and stellar service. I had the sesame noodles with peanut sauce, full of shredded veggies. Husband had udon chicken noodles. He was thrilled. Getting used to the dim sum lady took a little getting used to, we likened it to a mobile sushi track...moving the dim sum around the dining room! We thoroughly enjoyed and will be back."}
{"text":"I had a late dinner there. Arrived around 9:45 pm. They were serving late night menu which didn't include the fried rice i wanted so I got roast duck over rice. Tasted really good. Large chunks of roast duck and the waitress reminded me to be careful with bones. Will go again!"}
{"text":"Food was good and was on the table in less than 5 minutes. 

Service was great.

Price wise: 
*Quite expensive* but what isn't on the strip. 
I guess I would rather pay a little more than to go outside and look for the same food that's cheaper in price. 

Environment really takes you to another place. Decorations all the way down to the tables make this place beautiful.

Serving size is just enough for one person so do not plan on sharing with someone. Order your own.

We ordered the duck on rice, BBQ pork on rice, juicy pork dumplings, lobster fried rice and noodles. All delicious.

I love that there is Asian food available in the Paris hotel and casino!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The noodles are delicious. I came back this year specifically for the lo mein. My boyfriend ordered different noodles, loved them, but had a bite of my lo mein and wanted to come back to order lo mein. We also love the Dim Sum carts. You can see all the food before you choose. Everything we've had has been delicious. I'll come back to Yong Kang every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The owners of the infamous Din Tai Fung dumpling house family chain now has a  noodle house in Las Vegas! I didn't connect the two until I saw the picture of Taiwan on their wall and it says Din Tai Fung in small letters. I asked the manager and he confirmed. 

TAIWANESE BEEF NOODLE SOUP SPICY
Finally! A noodle place inside a big hotel! I liked this bowl a lot. Late night, good slurpy soup, good and comforting. The flavors are also on point.  Beef was nice and tender, broth dark and flavorful but not too rich. The veggies fresh too. Price is high of course at about $13.99 a bowl but I shared it with my friend since we were eating out a lot in Vegas. 

Soup spoons here are big and deep so it holds a amount of both noodle and broth per bite. I need to get these for home."}
{"text":"Long lines, food is just okay.  The list of menu offerings is reasonably authentic but the quality of the individual items is only just okay."}
{"text":"Meh. Dim sum off the cart was tepid or cold. Edible but nothing was memorable. Pricey for what you get; way overpriced when you consider the quality of the food. On the plus side there seldom seems to be a line to get in (I now know why)."}
{"text":"Nothing to say about their food... They try to mimic every asian foods from taiwanese to vienamese but don't seemed to get anything right. Just go to next japanese restaurant and get udon instead of low quality noodles of y k."}
{"text":"Alex y is awesome. I hope he remembers me when I come back. The kid gets everything we ask for best dim sum."}
{"text":"Sounds like most of the negative reviews are from stuck up rude people that have never eaten fresh food. I've heard one person complaining it was tasteless while the next person said it was too salty. In case you have never eaten Chinese food or noodles, umm, it's salty., but In a good way. The next beef seems to be that it's expensive. Yeah it's expensive. No doubt you can find the same meal somewhere for at least half the price, not sure where but I'm sure they are out there some where in the slums of vegas. You won't find it in the strip in the middle of a huge casino hotel. They have to pay rent to be in such a prime location. So you get to pay for the convenience. As for the food. Absolutely amazing. Super fresh and off the charts. We didn't mind one bit paying the bill. It was one of two restaurants that we ate at that made our entire trip to Vegas worth It."}
{"text":"So... highly disappointed. Came here a few weeks ago before catching a show at Paris. Wanted to grab a quick bite and it wasn't crowded so we figured why not... ugh what a mistake.

First off the only pleasant person was the hostess. After that it seemed like everyone was in a hurry to just get their shift done and go home.

Started off with the vegetable egg rolls... nothing but the taste of oil. I'm not sure these were even fresh. Maybe they'd been frozen for a while. Whatever the case it just wasn't good at all.

Second was the Taiwanese beef noodle soup... broth was flavorless and the noodles were soggy. At one point I wanted to ask for some hot sauce but our waiter was too busy around the corner eating his dinner. When he did come out he still had food in his mouth...

Save your money and grab a slice of pizza around the corner."}
{"text":"Located in the Paris Casino, Yong Kang Street offers dim sum and noodles and other Chinese fare.
The layout of the restaurant is pretty cool- styled to look like a Taiwanese noodle shop, with a dim sum lady going around with the carts. We had a fairly large group (10 people) but they were accommodate us quickly.
Service was quick and attentive, with no mix ups with the orders. One friend ordered the roast duck and the rest of us got noodle soups. I ordered the Hong Kong wonton noodle soup- it was huge and satisfying, and the wontons were stuffed with meat and shrimp.
Food was good but a little expensive for what it is (but its Vegas, so I guess everything is expensive- but then again, I'm from NYC where things are expensive, and the price of the noodle soup surprised even me)
Totally A-OK place"}
{"text":"I was skeptical to come because of the 3-star review, but after coming here, I don't really get it, because the food is pretty good! 
Decided to come after having food poisoning from Chipotle (note to self: never again!) and needed to eat something light. Also, as I was staying in Paris Las Vegas, it was very convenient. Got a bowl of Vietnamese noodles, which was super delicious. It came in less than 10 minutes, the chicken was super tender, the noodles were great and the broth was soo good! Was very surprised. I guess people can say it might be a pricy place, but considering all the other restaurants around that are much more expensive, this restaurant is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Seeing their advertising along the Paris entrance makes us want to give it a try. It was our first time here and I guess it also will be our last time. It was completely awful and horrible experience. 

Foods were so so BAD from the dim sum carts to the main dishes. We ordered Har Gow and Xiao Long Bao as our starter. They were cold and bland. The noodle soup was completely ruining my day. 

We politely asked for togo boxes in order to not make the server feel awkward, because we did leave so much food on our plates. Guess what, i decided throwing them away right after we left the restaurant. 

\"OVERPRICE\" $70 for 2, I dont mind to pay if it's worth. I guess this place should not be in the hotel like Paris. If you love authentic Chinese food, you will be very disappointed."}
{"text":"Yelp scam alert!!!
Taipei street food style joint located inside Paris Las Vegas.
Each table had pamphlets asking customers to review them on yelp and check in on yelp to get a free drink.
We checked in on yelp and sure thing a free drink coupon showed up.
When it was time to order, I showed our server the coupon and asked her what drinks I could order with that.
Now it gets interesting (and very very shitty).
Our server told us that the free drink is only for people who give them a good review on yelp. So, I would have to write a \"good\" review on yelp and \"show\" it to her and only then would she give us the free drink. 
I am guessing a lot of 5 star reviews here are in exchange for a free drink.
Fake reviews all around!! Not at all expected from a decently high end place like this. 
Horrendous. Scam. Fake Reviews.

The food wasn't bad though. We had dim sums and the Singaporean noodles. The noodles were good, dim sum was decent- a little too dry for my liking.
However this is Las Vegas, there are tons and tons of great places to eat which do not ask you to write a \"good\" review and \"show\" it to them for a free drink.
Better avoided.
I hope the yelp team takes notice."}
{"text":"Not good at all. Very bland... Right now as we speak the manager is taking my food back.. Yes it's cute and yes it's in Paris but don't come here for food! Tons of other places in Vegas I could of gone to: never ever again! Nobody at my table has enjoyed their food. The little lady pushing the cart of dumplings and tempura is cute/ sweet and friendly. Thankfully they were took back our food without any hesitation .. They must be familiar with this !!"}
{"text":"WORST PLACE EVER! My son swelled up like a balloon and ended up in the emergency room after having their Beef noodle soup. They put way too much MSG!!! Don't take your kids here!! This place should be shut down."}
{"text":"1) FOOD. We ordered the Beef Noodle Soup and the Minced Pork over Rice. Coming from two people who are Asian, eat Asian food regularly, and really enjoy Taiwanese food specifically, the food here was delicious. The BNS was flavorful, topped with Jalapeños for extra spice, and came hot. 

I even got a Hong Kong milk tea and that was also very good. (Wish they had boba!)

They even serve dimsum which I thought was cool. We didn't try it, though.

2) SERVICE. Very prompt. We were seated quickly, food was ordered quickly, and food arrived fairly quickly. 

We will definitely be back if we are ever in the area, for sure. We were hesitant because of the low ratings but don't be scared away by the negative reviews & give it a chance! We were glad we did."}
{"text":"Dried up dimsum and noodle soups taste like just plain hot water. The worst, that's right, THE WORST, chinese cuisine experience I ever had. Food is very overpriced compared to quality. Food is made without any care or passion. Please save your money and eat at Panda Express! Never going back."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for some lunch. This Chinese restaurant is located in the Paris casino.

The layout of the restaurant is really cute. It looks like an open air cafe in the streets of Paris or something. There's cute lights hanging from the sign, and tables \"inside\" the railing as well as \"outside\" the railing (so it looks like you're eating on the street).

The menu is mixed dimsum and ordering entrees. To my amazement, there was actually a woman pushing a dimsum cart around the tables. But be warned that it's Vegas and the prices are a lot higher than your usual dim sum place. Small, medium, and large orders are closer to $7, $8, and $9 per dimsum order.

I thought this place wouldn't be that good but I was surprised by the quality of the food. The pineapple bun dimsum was pretty good! The buns were very fresh and large, and the pineapple bun coating/shell on the top was delicious. It was probably the most expensive pineapple bun I purchased from anywhere ($3.88 for two buns) but it was still good.

The xiao long bao came in an order of 4. It was decent, but I thought the dumplings could have been a little bigger and juicier. Probably not worth the I think $8-$9 for a small order of 4.

The dan dan noodles were interesting. The sauce was excessive so it almost looked like a soup noodle dish when you get the bowl. But I thought the sauce turned out well, since it was really peanut/sesame flavored. It was also quite spicy too! I ordered duck with the noodles (you get a choice of meat), but I didn't think the BBQ duck went that well with the dan dan noodles sauce.

The ramen broth was a bit too watery for my taste but mild enough for my dad.

Scallion pancake was good too, although it's just the pancake, no egg like my mom would make it at home!

Also don't try to get Total Rewards points here. It doesn't seem to work, and after talking to the Total Rewards desk, you can redeem your points here but I think the minimum was like 200 points for $1 (hardly seems worth it especially for casual Vegas goers like me)."}
{"text":"This Vegas getaway started with an unexpected stop for sushi in Henderson. So why not let the unpredictable continue? Who wants some Dim Sum served in a setting that resembles Chinatown in Paris?

Once again, my girlfriend and I allowed our experience combined with luck to make the decision where to eat. Yong Kang Street looks like part of the Disney-esque setting. Somehow, the Paris street scape inside morphs into a comfortable, themed patio setting for the dining room. And with the kitchen on full display, it's difficult to resist.

One unique feature of Yong Kang Street, is the Dim-Sum carts that are constantly passing by loaded with steaming hot, tasty morsels. After three or four passes and constant \"gotta try that\" urges, we agreed that we had grazed enough. In fact, this meal passed so quickly, not that we were rushed or in a hurry, that I didn't get any photos of the food. Until Desert.

While the assortment of appetizers and Lobster Fried Rice were all wonderful, so was the fruit flavored Mochi (ice cream). Green tea is typical and refreshing. But I enjoyed the raspberry and mango best.

It was a different kind of dining experience. Everything was freshly prepared and the chefs were all working non-stop. Plus our server Soo Mi was wonderful. Yong Kang Street is on our \"must visit again\" list."}
{"text":"First time have the DimSum place use the tea bag for the tea! No taste at all! The BBQ meat like just buy it from Costco then heat it up! Deep fried chicken roll not hot, not crispy! So expensive! Two people order three dish is over $50.00. Never go again!"}
{"text":"Great dim sum and dumplings. The Shanghai Lomein is more like Hong Kong style egg noodles rather than thick noodles. Overall, a solid Asian eatery with Las Vegas price tag."}
{"text":"Ordered the duck noodle, and the taste is no good the duck was not fresh and the shop is lacking taste, overpriced, will not go back....."}
{"text":"Went here on the last day of a Vegas weekend trip. Worst choice ever.. Dim Sum was $5/small plate. The Vietnamese beef soup was $16.99. Not satisfying at all, especially for the overpriced food. Save yourself some money, and eat elsewhere. I'll give 1 star for the nice waiters & waitresses."}
{"text":"Awesome dim sum!  My fav is the chicken feet. And be sure to try the Vietnamese coffee. We will def be back. Open til 3am!"}
{"text":"Great location among the hustle and bustle inside Paris hotel and casino.  Very kind staff seated me in a great \"people watching\" section.  We worked with many people for ordering Dim Sum.  The gentleman pushing the cart was very nice.  Same goes for the guy who took my drink order.  A big bonus was a free Thai Ice Tea from checking into Yelp.

The big reason they are getting only 3 stars is because of the quality of the Dim Sum.  It definitely tasted like it had been reheated and was not fresh at all.  For both the Shrimp Dumpings and the Shumai.  We are probably spoiled from the fresh Dim Sum we get at our favorite restaurants in Seattle, but we expected more from Paris."}
{"text":"The name of the restaurant makes me think of my hometown so I decided to give it a try, and Yong Kong Street does not make me down! The beef noddle is authentic, and the bubble tea is awesome!! Reminds me of home, so glad to see they got such good Taiwanese food in Vegas. I would definitely come again next time!!"}
{"text":"Great place for fresh dimsums and that is the only thing worth eating here. Tried noodles, veg stirr fry and roast duck..all pretty average."}
{"text":"Service is good but food is a bit over priced. Food was good but didn't blow my socks off. Best to go in a party of 3 or more to share dishes and dim sum. And they are not part of Pairs so you can't add points to your reward card."}
{"text":"Not the greatest .. but it is open until 3 am.. it's way overpriced. And the food is not authentic Chinese food it's very bland . It is very expensive . You are not really getting what you paid for here."}
{"text":"best hangover cure!
dumplings on point!
beef noodle soup makes you breed like a stud no rhino pills needed that day!
you're body is a wonderland!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. After asking the woman bringing the dim sum cart around for a recommendation and she had nothing to say, I ordered the pork Dan dan noodles. There was tons of oil pooling in the bottom and the pork was so dry I couldn't eat it. That pork seemed like it was under a heat lamp for three days. $20 wasted."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them \"0\".dan Dan noodle is presented with weird spicy sesame source and some overcooked  bean sprout.it looked gray color and look  like a shit. Doesn't look tasty at all. I tasted a little bit. It's strange flavor. It's complete wrong dishes. I asked a waiter. He said that is Dan Dan noodle. Don't expect you will get authentic , good quality Chinese food here. The price is high too. Their menu price is different from the price online! , so I checked out with tips. That's it. Don't go to this place even for try!"}
{"text":"I didn't expect to be able to find good Chinese food on the strip. Gotta be honest I just doubt they could be authentic and actually have the flavor it's supposed to. I am surprised. I've walked by this place every time I'm in Vegas and I always just assumed that a Chinese restaurant inside a hotel called Paris didn't scream authentic. We stopped by at about 1 or 2 in the morning and it was just incredible. Tasted great, the broth of the noodle soup wasn't too salty and still had flavor without being a thick soup. The only critique I have would be the service. It was just a little bit on the abrasive side; a little rough around the edges but other than that and the fact that the spicy wonton wrappers were a little thick. It was perfect. Price could be a little lower for the quality of food and the experience given but you are on the strip and this is to be expected. I would recommend one visit just to try it out but it wouldn't be a repeat for me unless I was craving this specifically."}
{"text":"I honestly would not recommend eating at Yong Kang Street unless if you are truly super hungry and it is the only place that is open to eat at. 

My boyfriend, his cousin, and I were super hungry. We were searching for a spot to eat and settled with this place since the food smelled so delicious. However, the aroma from the food was all false hope because once you take a bite of any of the dishes then you begin to regret your choice. Don't get fooled like we did because I definitely know there are several YUMMY taiwanese food restaurant elsewhere. 

What we've had:
Dim sum dishes - it was A-OK and super overpriced. 
DanDan Noodles with BBQ Pork - oh man was this super salty. Bleh. 
Stir-Fried Udon with BBQ Pork - it's like you are eating plastic fried noodles with veggies and BBQ pork. NOPE! 
Taiwanese Style Beef Soup - this was seriously the best out of the dishes. It was good. We should of just stuck with eating soup instead (ha). 

Overall, I love the decor of this place. It is cute. Service was A-OK. And I still had a great time with the people I was with, but the food is a definite no go. 

AS ALWAYS, NOM FOR LIFE!"}
{"text":"Had dim sum!  Everything was great!  The soup dumplings could have been hotter-temp wise and the steamed rice was a little dry.. and I was worried from another review that the casing was going to be super thick, but it wasn't that bad! We had shumai, chicken legs, shrimp dumplings, charsubao, and steamed rice.  My mom raved about the chicken legs!! I didn't try them  service was quick and friendly.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here around midnight with a buddy looking for something warm before calling it a night. Being Chinese, I expected the food to be mediocre at best and it was. The dimsim was marginally better than microwave dimsum. The shrimp noodle soup surprisingly hit the spot. But none of these warranted the one star rating. The service was the worst I've had at a food establishment. After receiving our food, our server (I think his name was Michael) completely disappeared. We finished our food and we did not spot him once. No one came by to check on drinks or anything. We had to flag down a random server to get our check. We then waited around trying to flag anyone down to take  our payment and we were about to just walk out since no one was there when we finally saw our original server and flagged him down. He walked over, grabbed the book without saying a word or looking at us, and a long while later, came back and dropped off the book. Again, without a word or acknowledging we were even there. I don't expect much after midnight and I wasn't looking for world class service but literally the only words we heard from him the whole night were literally \"What would you like?\" and \"This is your wonton soup. Wait. I think that's the wonton soup? Wait what did you order? Oh yea this is the shrimp noodle\"."}
{"text":"I love the restaurants inside the Paris hotel. You get to feel like you are dining al fresco with their faux cloud ceilings and winding paved walkways, without having to actually sit outside in the desert heat (yes, please!). 

My friend and I had just finished our massage appointments and were starved, so we suggested meeting back up with my husband here since it was a halfway point between the Bellagio (where we were) and our hotel (the Mirage). 

They weren't busy when we arrived, so we snagged a table next to the main walkway for optimal people watching views. We ordered two beers and their steamed pork and vegetable gyoza to snack on while we waited for my husband to arrive. They were delicious and disappeared from our table quickly. 

They also rolled over a dim sum cart filled with piping hot treats and gave us their group menus to help determine what everything was. Group A is $5.88 an item, B is $6.88, C is $7.88, and D is the most expensive at $9.88 a piece. We were more in the mood for noodles though so we decided to pass on the cart offerings. 

Once my husband got there we ordered another appetizer for the table, this time being the spicy chili shrimp and pork wonton dumplings. Those are addictive! I could have easily put away 4 more plates of those by myself. Don't say I didn't warn you. 

For our mains we got hot sesame noodles with BBQ pork, and hot Dandan noodles with chicken (you can get their noodle dishes either hot or cold). The peanut sauce on the Dandan noodles was perfectly balanced with notes of sweet and heat, but the sesame noodles were probably my favorite because of that yummy pork. It was smokey and fall apart tender.  

This meal really hit the spot and was perfect for sharing. It's a little on the pricey side, but that's to be expected of most places on the strip."}
{"text":"Dry dim sum costs $8 per dish...? No thanks. Late night mistake. Service is super quick to the point that makes you feel like you have to leave soon. Server lady grabbed the dim sum plate as soon as I picked up the last piece of dim sum... There is a mismatch between type of service/food they offer and price they charge."}
{"text":"I can understand the low reviews. Service was lacking and the quality of food ( soups ) was plain. 

Seen a worker compress a trash can with his bare hands then serve food to a table twice!

Unreal! Only reason for the two stars is dim sum at dinner time."}
{"text":"Awesome place - dumpling and pasta. The soups are delicious. I definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Wow the food here was so fresh and delicious. I ordered the oden soup (pictured) and the broth was amazingly flavorful! The dim sum was also to die for. My favorite pick was the chicken feet (don't judge me lol). Our hostess was also very sweet and attentive. A little pricey but it's Vegas"}
{"text":"This place is a whole lotta meh... if you like authentic Asian food, dim sum & noodle soups, I'd pass. I went here with some coworkers during a trade show and was underwhelmed. Taiwanese beef noodle soup was the best thing I had but overall not worth the $$. So many better options in Vegas"}
{"text":"We ordered the Taiwanese Style Beef soup, Lobster Fried Rice, and the Hong Kong Style Noodle Soup. All dishes lacked flavor, and was not very authentic. They also had a dim sum cart going around which had very basic items. Each dish was about $20 which is extremely expensive for the portion, and the type of food we were eating. Will not be returning due to being extremely overpriced for bland food."}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre food. Having had lots of Chinese food from the Bay Area, considering the price of food in Las Vegas, this is pretty overpriced and bland tasting food with small portion. Only went here for the convenience when staying at Paris Hotel and did not hit the spot for Chinese food."}
{"text":"It is a good choice to go there.  I order Dinsum carts and Tonkatsu Ramen! It is delicious for me. I can't believe it only 3 stars?
I shar my videos

{"text":"This is first time for me. I'm just wanna try. Dumpling & Noodle House at The Paris Resort and Cacino. They're have so many asian noodle in menu. But the price a little bit expensive and so small portion. (Maybe Coz in Hotel but another restaurant big portion) about test is ok not bad."}
{"text":"We went to see the Eiffel tower in Paris Las Vegas, got hungry, saw Yong Kang Dim Sum with push carts (very important)! We ate there, OMG, it is just as good as when we were in NYC for Dim Sum! You have to ask for Lun. He is The BEST waiter!!!!!! We had THE Best food and experience! Definitely coming back when we are in town!!!!"}
{"text":"The worst chinese Japanese food ever!!! Waitress rude from China and refused to speak Chinese! Noodle are not fresh and price for ramen is outrageous! Almost forgot dim sum price - get your platinum card out!"}
{"text":"We came in expecting to have just a quick noodle bowl and www surprised with all the dim sum choices. Everything was consistently tasty, especially their pork buns, their sesame balls and custard tarts! 

The price was good. About $25pp including tea and tip."}
{"text":"One of the best dim sum I've ever had in America. The price is a little bit pricey if you wanna get full. My boyfriend and I ordered 5 different types of dimsum and an a la carte noodles and the bill in total was $80.00. So it's definitely not cheap. But honestly it's sooo good I can't complain. The wait was fast too and the service was really good. Totally recommend."}
{"text":"This is the place for fast delicious Chinese food. Everything was good and service was fast. We had shrimp dumplings, pork buns, crab balls and chicken feet. About 5 people helped us at different times. They all work together very well. Nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Really good food! I wish I had a bigger appetite! I don't recommend the Taiwanese beef noodle soup. Didn't like the taste.

Chicken feet were good 

Great service!"}
{"text":"So it was late at night, because its Vegas of course, when we tried this place. 

We got three bowls of chicken noodle soup, Taiwanese style.
It did hit the spot--great flavorful broth, well cooked chicken, very delicious noodles, and the addition of broccoli was also very nice. The chili oil they bring you adds a nice taste it as well. I asked for limes and the server brought my lemon, so its definitely not pho friendly, but again its a good noodle soup that can substitute for pho when you need it most. I would say it was a pho/ramen hybrid.

Overall it was delicious with good service but I'm not sure I would go again unless I really needed something late night. It just may have not been my taste. But I would recommend :)"}
{"text":"Almost felt like I was back in Hong Kong where I had the best dim sum. Service could have been a little faster but it was pretty packed. I would return again if I were back in the area."}
{"text":"The dumplings hit the spot! Loved how the dim sum cart were pushed around! Mike is great!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on our last night at the Paris hotel.  We ordered some good dim sum dishes off their two rolling carts, one was for the steamed dishes and the other for the fried dishes. Also ordered some noodle dishes from their menu. Everything tasted good. My daughter had their spicy Taiwanese beef noodle soup but said it wasn't as spicy as other ones she's had previously from other places. If you like spicy food, I recommend trying their spicy shrimp dumplings. We enjoyed that dish the most. Would love to go back and try other dishes. My suggestion is if you're doing dim sum,  don't order just food from the menu. I guarentee you won't finish your food if you do. Unless you only order one or two dim sum dishes as appetizers."}
{"text":"Young Kang Street is a great place to stop in late night for a quick bite if you're in the Paris hotel. The BBQ pork over rice and the won ton soup are excellent choices. Service is also excellent. They are open till 3 am."}
{"text":"Food is not special but is edible. The fried rice was OK and the dim sum cart was OK as well. You could definitely do better if looking for Chinese food but you could do worse as well."}
{"text":"Dim sum was great - though piping hot and juicy were the steam dumplings, the wrapping used was too thick - loved the taste and texture of their Dan Dan and beef noodles - the mixed veggies were crispy, but nothing special in taste - all in all, with its appealing setting - it's an ok casual spot!"}
{"text":"Loved this small little restaurant in between the Bally's hotel and the Paris, it specializes in dim sum and we had a excellent tawaniese beef noodle soup (share as the portion is enough for two). Dim sum are small orders and range from 5.88 - 9.00. Despite the mediocre reviews I appreciate the small portions and you can pick and choose as you go."}
{"text":"The noodles are pretty good. The staff is all Asian and the food is authentic. But if you know authentic noodles you know the authentic price. I had a hard time paying $22+ for a bowl of noodles when I pay $3 in China and Taiwan for yummy noodles. I get it it's Vegas and all and the food is good. I liked the Hong Kong milk tea that came with a check in!"}
{"text":"The ad is deceptive. Yong Kang Street should not be located inside Paris hotel in Vegas. Food truck would serve them best. Food is ok. Dim sum is just one cart with same \"potstickers\", etc. Disappointed. Not a cozy environment."}
{"text":"This establishment should be closed. It took over 45 minutes to receive our order of soup & noodles. After the extensige delay they forgot to give us spoons which took another 3 requests and 15 minutes to get. Once we were able to eat the noodles they  weren't cooked all the way. In the end this was one of the worst dining  experiences I have ever had."}
{"text":"Just arrived from long flight, asked for take out and they said didnt provide take out yet. Ordered Japanese ramen was so salty and told the waitress but offered to add hot water. What ashame! Bbq fried rice took forever and can not accept room charge. What on earth this place already open."}
{"text":"Pricey for the same food in a Chinese restaurant but you are paying for the convenience. Dim sum brought out on a cart added to an already nice atmosphere. Food quality is so-so. Service people are very friendly."}
{"text":"This is must to visit if you are in Vegas. I have been then for more than 5 times now. Dim-sums are really good in taste and we ordered duck noodles which were so good in taste."}
{"text":"It's cheap, but definitely not for those that get an upset stomach easily. There are much better options for affordable dining in the area. Both my girlfriend and I felt awful after eating there, so be careful venturing here."}
{"text":"Cute little place inside the paris hotel.  I was looking for a small meal so I decided to head down to get some dim sum.  Compared to other Chinatown places ive been this dim sum was really really expensive!  The cheapest item was 7$.  The dim sum was okay, I will say they came around with that cart every couple minutes.  I ordered a bunch of the dumplings, all of which were just okay.  I had a thai tea that was really the star of the meal.  I left feeling full but also a little ticked off that 3 small dim sum dishes costs me 35$!"}
{"text":"FOOD
- Japanese Tonkotsu Ramen With Pork: ramen with 4 slices of pork and half aged egg with bean sprouts and green onions. The flavor was okay. I felt like it was lacking something. It was definitely overpriced, but what isn't in Vegas? 3.5/5

SERVICE
We were immediately greeted and seated. Our waitress was attentive. I didn't have any complaints. 3.5/5

FINAL THOUGHTS
Decent food. I wouldn't spend this much on ramen anywhere else, but when in Vegas I know food will be pricey. They have a lot of different noodle options. I would come back to try other things."}
{"text":"Vergogna. Dumplings per nulla freschi, prezzi elevatissimi per la qualità offerta. Personale non particolarmente disponibile ed educato. 
Sinceramente lo sconsiglio."}
{"text":"Great Chinese/Japanese food.  Especially the Udon noodles. You need to cone here. The Lucky Buddah also a great flavor. Another must have. For sure coming back. Fyi my second time here."}
{"text":"Good for some late night eats but that's about it. We came in late from the airport and wanted a hot meal so we definitely got one here!

We had the BBQ pork/duck rice bowl, wonton noodle soup, and BBQ pork noodle soup. The meats were actually decent! I enjoyed the broth for the noodle soup but it was definitely on the bland side. The noodles themselves weren't that great either.

As far as pricing goes, it's not TK Noodles...LOL. About $15-$20 a dish which isn't bad considering you are on the Strip. A la carte dim sum was $6-$9 a dish.

Venue is small but service is good! If you use casino comps here, they still charge you tax which is odd. 

Most annoying part of the meal though? Some stupid fire alarm kept on going off. Loud speaker annoucement, flashing light, and siren. It was annoying and loud. When we asked the server about what was going on...he said that it's a normal every day thing and \"no big deal\". A loud and screeching siren definitely didn't make it pleasant to sit here.

A flat 3! I didn't wanna round it down to a 2 because of the siren but food wise, it wasn't bad! If you have a craving for some dim sum and chinese BBQ, stop by! It's not bad!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!!! This place is delicious. The beef noodle soup is my favorite item on the menu. I was very impressed. Everything was fresh and delicious and perfectly spicy. The service was great! This is a great place to go to with all of your friends during your stay!"}
{"text":"The food is not really bad, but the front desk waitress is really bad. She asked me and my family to sit outside. I asked her if we could sit inside, and she said that it was full and we couldn't sit. It doesn't matter, maybe the restaurant is going to take a break. However, I saw many times when she let other people sit inside. I don't think inside is full actually, because no one is sitting outside like us. Is she discrimination?
And, when we almost finished eating, even if we didn't ask for a checkout, the waiter quickly gave us a check. This restaurant made me very disappointed in Las Vegas.
If only I go to this restaurant, I will not give them any tips. Their service is very terrible. I will not go again.
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
??????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has like 3 stars.  That's definitely not fair in my book.  I've eaten dumpling from all over.  I think this place is one of the best in the country, even ahead of Din tia fung.  I always order the spicy shrimp and fresh made soup dumplings.  I come here at least once every time I'm in Vegas, as I it's one of my favorites.  Keep up the great work yong kang!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Vegas. I usually stay at the Paris so it's super convenient, plus it's open late  (3am maybe?). The appetizers (dumplings or other small things) are ready for you as soon as you sit down. They roll the cart around and you can pick right from there. Raman is pretty dang good, lots of choices."}
{"text":"We needed a quick bite to eat before heading out to a show and Yong Kang Street was a good choice in Paris, where we were staying. Loved the dim sum cart of tasty options. We got the pot stickers and the pork & shrimp siu mai dumplings. Both tasted fresh and delicious. We shared the dan dan noodles with BBQ pork which were just ok. Sauce was very thick with a peanut butter flavor and not much spiciness. Pork on top was a bit dry and chewy. 

Service was good and quick, and someone came by to top off our water during the meal which I always appreciate. I checked in to Yelp to get a complimentary Thai iced tea which was yummy. Decor is charming; if you squint you could actually kind of imagine this being a street cafe in Asia. Prices are probably pretty standard for the Strip. Overall we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"This place is located by the turnstiles at Columbus Circle. Good sushi. Picked up lunch here for the 1st time today using MealPal. There was a promotion so I was able to get my lunch for free!! YAY. Got the 8 roll salmon avocado. It was fresh and tasty. Happy with the food and the service. Will return. Thanks"}
{"text":"Very western version type restaurant and very expensive!
Juicy dumplings were dry and bland
Noodles in soup ok
Way overpriced, but they were in the Paris Hotel so what do expect.
Excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are pretty picky about Asian food, but this place surprised us. We tried the lobster noodles and roasted duck fried rice which were both pretty good! Plus we liked the fact that they also had dim sum carts."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit here. Watching a woman push a cart and offer items like tempura shrimp and sesame balls brought me back to the streets of Chinatown. Here we enjoyed tasty dumplings, hot noodle soup, and tasty roast duck. Washed it all down with a ice cold tsing tao. Our server was very friendly and helpful with the menu.

I would like to give this place a another go. Maybe next time im in town."}
{"text":"This is our second time here . The food is always amazing  
Tasting with great service. I highly recommend the dim sum cart ."}
{"text":"Only the second time eating here but will always eat here, when in Vegas. Staff and food are awesome and will always recommend."}
{"text":"Well, I had a strange experience here. My wife and I found this place in the Paris hotel and wanted to give it a try. It's open until 3am, we were thrilled about that since we just saw Jersey Boys there.. The people working were very nice and helpful, our waitress was exceptionally gracious. My wife got the chicken noodle soup and it was delicious. We also got some dim sum and it was great. I got the Taiwanese Style Beef Noodle Soup (see picture) and didn't really like it. I think the problem was that it was too authentic for me. I'm pretty sure soup contained  a blood broth and the flavor was just not to my liking. We both ate all of the chicken soup and the dim sum. The waitress noticed that I didn't like the beef noodle soup and took it off the bill for us. I think the lesson here is to know what you are ordering. Again, it was a lovely place but I just didn't care for what I ordered."}
{"text":"Noodles.  Not that great. Textures were off (well... I'm sure the noodles were machine pressed...) and the seasoning was less than impressive... I want more toppings too And Vegas prices...

I really wish my family would move away from Vegas so I didn't have to keep spending money at overpriced eateries that think too much of themselves..."}
{"text":"After we dropped of all of our stuff in the hotel rooms, we went downstairs and ate at Yong Kang Street. Stephanie S. and I thought it was pretty funny since we just got back from Taiwan (with the real Yong Kang Street), but our group was down for some dim sum. It turned out to be the most expensive dim sum we've ever had!

A small order was about $8 and noodle dishes were $20 or more. All of the dishes were just okay. When you tack on prices that are 3 times more than usual... Yikes! Lesson learned: When in Vegas, don't eat Chinese food. Surprisingly, for a group of 8, we only paid $25 each.

For these prices, you could definitely eat better elsewhere in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went with some friends, and I had to try the dumplings. Usually I am not  big dumpling person, and I was hoping this would change me...the service was great, the seating was quick and the food was plentiful....however, the dumplings were sticky and over cooked. I still give it a 4/5 though because everything else was on point. They accommodated my group of friends and we were able to get seated very quickly. I might have to give them a second chance the next time I am out there."}
{"text":"Quick place to grab lunch and some dim sum.  Reasonably priced and pretty tasty.  Good location."}
{"text":"Cool little place in the Paris hotel. Little pricey, but the food tasted great and fresh. The noodles were nice and chewy and didn't feel old. Egg tarts were great too!

The service was really nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Delicious Shanghai bodies with chicken. Shrimp fried rice not that flavorful. Although shrimp cooked to perfection. Service quick and frieindly.  Love to eat and people watch in Paris."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly delicious!! I come from Alhambra / Rosemead in California and this place defiantly lives up to the expectations of Chinolandia there . 

The honk kong style wonton noodle was delicious!! Soup had a nice soft taste while the noodles were perfect firm and the wontons had a delicious flavor !

The shrimp steamed dim sum was absolutely delicious! Tastes just like the fancy dim sum places back home . Plus the soy sauce dio was great ! They mix it with something I couldn't put my taste buds to but amazing"}
{"text":"Sorry but this place is not worth to many words .
Except very very below average and 
Very very over priced 
Would not go back"}
{"text":"Authentic, great chinese food!

Love the pork dumplings and buns, and the noodles are GREAT. Especially love the broth. (It was the Taiwanese Style Beef Noodle Soup [YKS Special])

And they're open til 3am! WIN"}
{"text":"I've been here a lot of times, mostly because the Paris hotel is awesome and Yong Kang Street is open till 3 AM which is great! My favorite part is the cart with egg rolls and other dishes, it's a unique aspect of this restaurant, although sometimes the food is just room temperature. The tempura shrimp udon is delicious! The juicy pork dumplings (which I order religiously) are okay, they aren't like traditional soup dumplings from other dim sum places but it's good for the convenience in location and hours. I recommend Yong Kang Street for a quick bite."}
{"text":"The food is good, very pricey for low portions but it is very tasty. Now the service lacks unfortunately they have potential. Just don't give me the wrong order twice and assume once we get our food you don't have to check on us mr Alex. Was very kind of one of the line cooks to come to my table to ask if everything was well since he noticed the lack in the waiters. The place is beautiful as well, nice ladies going around in dim sum carts as well."}
{"text":"Solid choice for authentic dim sum in Paris 

Love that it's a cart system just like in the Chinatown areas we're used to.   From the chicken feet to the fried rice, all tasty and perfectly done in a really cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch and got a small portion of the juicy pork dumplings for a snack. $7.88 for 4 and it hit the spot. They are smaller than normal but not bad. Also got a free Vietnamese iced coffee with Yelp check-in!"}
{"text":"We didn't feel like going far from room in Paris so gave this a try. We were very pleased. Pork dumplings were very delicious and a variety of 7 different types of dim sum. My wife had the lobster fried rice and was very pleased with it and I had the bbq pork noodle bowl. Spicy perfect!!
Try it"}
{"text":"Not very authentic Chinese food.  We ordered the juicy pork dumplings and it the pork was PINK!!! They tried to explain it wa spunk because the way it thawed in the refrigerator and offered to make me a new one. I said no thanks so they cancelled that order for us. The only dish that was decent was the Japanese udon soup. That was decent. I had the chicken over ginger sauce. Bland and the chicken was basically steamed chicken breast which they served with white rice."}
{"text":"We came here because the kids are always wanting to eat rice and noodles. The food taste pretty authentic to me. However, the prices are exceptionally steep.

I think people are used to paying more than half the price of what you'll pay here. So that's why the reviews are what they are. But based on the taste & quality (not value), the food is delicious. Service was good.

We tried the Taiwanese beef noodle soup (well done but costs 3x what it should be charged at $18 a bowl with small bundle of noodles), the stirfried XO string beans (which were really delicious), and the sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf (decent). 
When i wanted to order an extra side of noodles, i think the charge was like $9 or $11. I forget.

Beware that it appears you will get a free milk tea or Thai tea for checking in but you'll be asked for a review first."}
{"text":"The worst noodle I had ever taste .  Service is horrible for price of an arm.  Do not eat here !!!!!"}
{"text":"Average food, average noodles, average broth, kinda pricey.  But if you are on the strip, craving noodles, the choices are limited so I guess you go here for the average food."}
{"text":"Terrible  taste !!! and terrible  price!!!!
They charged 18% service charge also
I didn't know that ...
I paid tip doble. ..
I complained  them but didn't get back credit
Be carefull!!! Double check your receipt !!!
Anyway don't go there!!!
Terrible taste!!!!
And too expensive !!!!"}
{"text":"This place makes me soooo sad. All I wanted was some good dim sum in Vegas but I realized it was not possible. We ordered the pork and veggie dumplings and scallion pancakes after about 20 mins of waiting in an empty restaurant. If you don't get something from the carts they walk around with, then you will have a hard time getting served. My stomach hurt for a full day after. All sad. Don't come here if you want quality."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Paris hotel and decided to give this cute Chinese place a try. 

Atmosphere was great; we've got Asian lanterns, wallpapers, and music playing (sometimes).
The food, however, was lacking. I expected as much due to Yelp reviews and the location. 

The selection isn't bad at all. 
You've got a dim sum cart that comes very often with common dim sum plates. I got the juicy pork dumplings (siu long bao). Of the 4, one was only juicy and 3 was dried up. It wasn't very flavorful and leaned more towards the salty side. I also got the bean curd roll that was very good.

Out of curiosity, I also ordered their lunch special which was the Singapore rice noodles with BBQ pork. I've had these noodles in different Chinese restaurants and I gotta say Yong Kang's version was the worst I've ever had. The BBQ pork was OK. The noodles were too wet (not soggy, just wet). The chunks of vegetables were too big. To finish, it was too salty (salt and soy sauce) with very little flavor that resembles what Singapore noodles should taste like.

Oh, if you like Thai iced tea, I recommend it. It's pretty average.

Lastly, the service was very good probably because there weren't many customers. They greeted me, smiled a lot, and constantly (almost on the aggressive side) asked if everything was OK.

Overall, if you're craving for some Chinese food and you don't have the means of transportation, head over here. If not, you've better off going to Chinatown."}
{"text":"Here once again because this place is incredible .. the Hong Kong soup with bbq pork is amazing .   I love the dumplings that are pushed around on the cart and you pick which ones you want .. don't miss out ..this place is a homerun!!"}
{"text":"Food was so-so... probably too salty for my taste. Way over priced. Dim sum were priced $6-9 each. A bowl of fried rice good for 1 person is priced $16. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Just had a great miso ramen. Asked for an extra egg. Perfect.... Over did it and got the chicken rice. It was fantastic"}
{"text":"I should have known better than to eat in any of the restaurants in this area, but it was pouring outside so I didn't want to venture far from my hotel. 

Based on the two food items I tried and a review of the items on the food cart I'd say the food here isn't too bad, but is way overpriced. What really put me off though was the service. There was a delay before someone came to take my order, so during that time I partook in one of the items from the dim sum cart - some kind of fried meat dumpling that was about on par with what I'd had at other dim sum joints but cost about three times more ($6.88 USD for two pieces). Once I finally ordered (spicy chilli wontons for just under $12 USD for 6 and a beer) the food came quickly. So quickly in fact that the condiments for said dumplings came out some 5 minutes later (after I had eaten them - for the record they were actually quite tasty).

The bill came out even faster... I was not even halfway through my beer before the waitress came out and unceremoniously dumped the bill on my table. She returned a few minutes later asking whether I was paying by cash or card. I pointed out that I wasn't even half done my beer and she apologized and went away.

Not sure what the rush was about, the restaurant wasn't even half full.

So in summary, food was okay (though mediocre if you live in city with good access to Asian food, like Toronto) but WAY overpriced, service needs work."}
{"text":"Serving size is too small for pricing. Could've been a whole lot better on the soups! Fried rice was ok! Dumplings were not too shabby. Had the taiwanese beef noodle soup tasted like noodles in soy sauce... Vietnamese beef noodle was also watered down could use more seasoning and flavor towards broth"}
{"text":"Yong Kang Street has nice decor, and looks very nice as a restaurant. I was feeling like eating some Asian cuisine, and this place fit the script!

We started off with the dim sum, which felt a little expensive for what you're really getting, but hey, you're in a casino. 

I went with the duck noodle soup, and it was decent. It is definitely better than what you would get at a random takeout place.. but not comparable to an authentic restaurant that you would find down Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"Expensive but good. They also are open really late so that is great in Vegas. To go orders are really fast. Dim sum is fresh and yummy. Pork fried rice is my favorite. But again it's expensive like a fine restaurant but this looks like a food court restaurant. Still recommend."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an awesome authentic beef noodle soup spot on the strip, this is the place to go. The noodle is nice and chewy while the broth is tasty and on point. It's a little spicy so it's actually perfect if you like spicy. 
I had Joseph as my serve, the guy is awesome. Make small conversation while you wait and checks up on the table consistently. Definitely not your typical Asian restaurant service."}
{"text":"Overpriced shit is putting it nicely. Service was good enough though. Waitress did very well."}
{"text":"I had the bbq stir fry unon& it's good, full with flavor! It's #10 if you want it. 

The service was good, food came out on time and the environment was nice and relaxing ."}
{"text":"Not enough for price paid and terrible customer service. I was very disappointed and would recommend to go to a better place on the strip."}
{"text":"Not as good of a dimsum , dumplings and noodles for the price. They do have a dimsum cart but they have three different dimsum prices which is not clearly displayed in the cart when you pick a dimsum from the cart. They just have a paper on your table that has Dimsum A, $5.88; Dimsum B $6.88 and Dimsum C $7.88 and they mark  A,B,C depending on what dimsum  you chose. We ordered Juicy  Pork dumplings $12.88 and it was dry. I think this is their  version of Xiao Long Bao. The Shanghai Lo Mein with duck which our server recommended ,$17.88, has more cabbage veggies than noodles and it was not that savory, more on the oily side. The Shrimp Tempura Udon, $17.88, came with two small tempura and maybe three spoonfull of noodles. Overall, food was okay but not something I would say \"have to try in Vegas.\""}
{"text":"Decent Chinese dim sum and noodles open late on the Strip in Vegas. Located inside Paris hotel and casino. Amazing decor made to look like the streets of Hong Kong or Shanghai. Prices are of course inflated but we were happy to pay given its location and hours they were open.

Must try their Beef Noodle Soup-- amazing al dente yellow egg noodle in a delicious beef broth. They are quite generous with their beef brisket though I did find a few pieces a bit tendony and chewy for my tastes. Good thing my boyfriend loves tendon!

They also have a dim sum cart that comes around classic HK dim sum style. We enjoyed everything we tried from the Shrimp Har Gow to the Pork Shumai. Again, higher prices than what you'd pay anywhere else but look around...you're not anywhere else but the heart of Vegas on the Strip! So just sit back, savor the flavors, and just enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Super fast service, great food, great ambiance!  Highly recommended! If you are in the area, drop by to get your dim sum fix and then enjoy the Vegas strip in style"}
{"text":"Hong Kong milk tea is really good, but not for almost $7. They don't have boba either."}
{"text":"The Dim Sum was extremely hood, I order a fried crab claw with shrimp. It was breaded just right.  I also had the House Fried Rice, which was very good. This may be my go to while here..."}
{"text":"My home is nearby Yong Kang Street in Taiwan, so I often grab some food there. The food in this restaurant tastes totally different from the food in my hometown, way below the standard. Not recommend at all."}
{"text":"Pretty good wonton soup but not the best dim sum we've ever had. The cart service for dim sum is a weird experience to me because I would rather have freshly steamed dim sum than to pick already cooked ones from a cart. Service was good and scenery of inside shops of Paris hotel was nice."}
{"text":"Newly opened in the Paris hotel in Vegas. Service was very attentive and friendly. They are totally on top of it. The food is amazing and authentic. We started with the spicy won tons in a spicy szechuan sauce. Very very good. Almost as good as my favorite Taiwanese place here in Irvine, A&J. I had the Taiwanese beef noodle soup - a classic. It was perfect. The broth was piping hot, rich, mildly spicy, and had the perfect amount of grease slick on top. Yum!!! The beef was superb and perfectly tender. Basically melted in your mouth. The noodles were perfectly cooked and stayed firm. My boyfriend had the dumpling soup, which was mild in flavor but very satisfying. He really loved the dumplings. They were big and plump with meat. It was the perfect cure for our hangovers. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Loved this place. It's pricey for Chinese food, but to find actual Chinese food that's authentic and good in the hotels on the strip is RARE.  Most of the time the food is obviously overpriced and bland. However the food here was enticing and wonderful. I loved the scenery and the service. We ordered the wonton soup, shrimp fried rice, and some dimsum. Everything was so delicious! The service is on point here so try it out!"}
{"text":"had chicken udon stir fried. very tasty. drew gives it a 4 and i do too. conni gave it a 3 though. make sure to try the appetizers theyre great."}
{"text":"This is located inside the Paris Hotel and is open late which are both convenient. I tried the dim sum which was average. The prices are a little expensive but inline with Vegas strip pricing. The service was good."}
{"text":"I give a 4 because I think I ate here 4 times of my 5 night stay. Sushi was ok, I would have preferred some additional dipping sauces but they are available upon request.  Pricing was good. Maybe a 3 plus w taste but I thought it was fun, interesting, good price. And I would do it again."}
{"text":"Not worth the money. Poor Chinese imitation. Thought about the dim sum but gladly did not order. Ordered the duck noddle soup.  Noddle tasted like instant ramen. Broth was more salty than flavorful. The duck was OK. This is despite me being drunk. Isn't everything supposed to taste better when you're drunk? Service was horrible too. Took a while to get a waiter. Granted decor was nice but that's about it."}
{"text":"The food, especially the Taiwanese Beef Noodle soup are full of flavors. The prices decent and the portion is fairly generous. Overall the place is a good hit, I would recommend the place."}
{"text":"Opens late, super fast take out, prices are steep, char siu (bbq pork) was good over napa cabbage and rice.

If you just need your fill for chinese comfort food, def. the spot to hit up :) it was 15.88 for what I would get for 5.99 in SF but the pork was juicy and tender and wasn't cheap so I appreciated it.

Not bad and I wans't event hungry!"}
{"text":"Stayed at Paris for three days this week and just got back.. Took my wife and in-laws to this restaurant knowing that it isn't going to be \"authentic \" since we're in the middle of a large casino for God's sakes but it should be decent enough...  NO WAY..  The food was overpriced and very bland on the flavor.  I had the BBQ over rice with some blanched lettuce or something at $18...  Horrible.  My in-laws had the soup with peanut sauce base.. Very basic and they didn't advise of the possible peanut content- I think it was called \"Singapore \" Noodle or something.  The server should have advised us in case any one of us had an allergy against peanuts.  The Dim Sum was 
acceptable but good Lord OVERPRICED!  I'm from Chicago guys and Asian.. I don't stay away from expensive restaurants it it has to be worth it..  Stay away from this place..:-|"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot in the Paris hotel and casino. The ambience is very nice in the sense that it resembles Taiwan night markets and has a warm feeling. The food is also pretty decent considering the chefs are straight asian. Only thing I don't like is the price. I mean, 20 bucks for a bowl of soup?! I get the concept of the rent they have to pay, but I just can't justify spending that much food I've paid for little for my whole life. Even if it's due to location. 

3 stats for this one."}
{"text":"This is not how dimsum is supposed to taste like! They pride themselves as the first dimsum cart restaurant in Las Vegas strip but they are doing it all wrong. This is messed up because they are giving dimsum cart a bad reputation. No justice! People, pork siumai does not cost $7. For 4 tiny pieces! Do not come here. You will regret it."}
{"text":"$18 bowl of chicken Pho. Was mediocre in flavor. Even after I doctored it like usual. Service was good, friendly staff, pricey for ramen and other noodle in my opinion but hey it's Vegas. Dim sum looked good but I wasn't in the mood this time. I'd probably pass in the future."}
{"text":"I had my doubts about this place coming in. A Taiwanese name for a place that serves Cantonese dim sum and Taiwanese dishes and Japanese ramen? Hmm. Also, I've never had any good authentic Asian food on the strip before. 

Luckily my doubts quickly went away as we started eating. We each ordered a noodle soup and then got 2 orders of xiao long bao to share. My won ton noodles had a nice light broth and totally hit the spot. I also tried their beef noodle soup broth and it was nice and flavorful (although oily) as well. I didn't try their dim sum, but our other friends who tried it said it was just okay. 

Their prices are pretty high, but I think you pay for the convenience of it being right at the foot of the elevators at Paris. They also have pretty attentive service for a Chinese restaurant.

Comfort food! Just what I needed after a long night of drinking and clubbing."}
{"text":"Limited choices, not as fresh as expected. It filled the void because I was hungry. I will try it again maybe not so late at night."}
{"text":"As a noodle lover, I may give 2 stars to the food, it's just average taste, but the things is u gotta care about the price, I know it's in Vegas, and everything is expensive, but$ 20 for a bowl of noodle? Not really, and I ordered No. 8, the Noodle with beef, it only gives u , let me see, three little cube, the taste, I can't say bad, but just not that good , not worth 20, and Its not fully cooked, I have to let them cook it again. Anyway, I'm not mad, just kinda wanna tell everyone, if u got any other a choice, just don't pick this one"}
{"text":"When you ask Michelle the hostess : Do you have Vegetable Dumpling ? She answered \"Yes, in the cart\"...I was very excited because you cannot find any in Las Vegas. I ordered some  Crispy Scallion pancake and Vegetable Spring Roll waiting for the cart to order my Vegetable Dumpling. Everything was greasy and not very good but was so excited for my dumpling to come..... The cart come and Surprise: The Vegetable Dumpling have Shrimp in it. When Michelle pass by, she told me: Yes but it is just a little bit......( not very good when you are a Vegan). at the exit, She apologized and  I asked to see the Manager, but her answer was: \"she is to busy right now.....\" I did not have time , left and decide to put the review on Yelp, so at least the Manager can see it. Food not good, service ( from the hostess) not good.....What a waste of my time."}
{"text":"The dim sum is not that bad (what would you expect from a dim sum place in the Paris hotel?), and the lobster fried rice is good. It is a bit on the pricier side, but other than that it was satisfying. 

The one in the Rio is actually better, but this is in the Strip"}
{"text":"To me, This place is worth 3 stars simply based on the atmosphere. It felt romantic and hip to sit underneath the cloudy painted ceiling and string lights. Loved the lady pushing the cart of dim sum around. The best thing I ate here were the eggrolls and the soup dumplings. After trying those, I just knew the entrees would be great. However, they were flavorless! Plain noodles/rice and chopped meat. I had to pour some of my dumpling dipping sauce on my noodles just to finish. The meat didn't have any flavor. 

I won't be back, no matter how good the ambiance and dumplings are. There are endless other options in Vegas where you can blow $70 on two people."}
{"text":"During my stay in Vegas, I went to this restaurant 3 times, warm welcoming service, genuine food, definitely a place to go if you wanna try some southern Chinese food"}
{"text":"Definitely over priced. The food is ok. I like the Venitian noodle place. More variety and the price isn't as outrageous as this place. I only came here case it's convenient!!"}
{"text":"Mike was a great server
The food was fantastic I recommend stopping in
I liked the way they came to the table and presented the food
Dim sum was delicious."}
{"text":"This was the only restaurant that looked good this late in the Paris hotel. A man rolled a cart around the tables with all kinds of dumplings. THEY WERE SO GOOD, the food came out fast and it did not disappoint! 10/10 recommend for ramen and dumplings."}
{"text":"This place saved us tonight!  Got out late on a Tuesday night and nothing decent was open until this charming destination! Everything was good until Mike our server. Then it got better! Delicious food, fast, but not fast food. And apparently, the entertainment comes on the side with the manager - server duo. Hilarious. Couldn't have asked for better! Love you guys!"}
{"text":"Noodles are on point! Gonna come again, BBQ pork noodles you need to get. The Tai tea is great as well."}
{"text":"Don't eat the sushi here! Very tiny sushi and the rice is too sticky :( dim sum is moderately good but over priced"}
{"text":"Great place for late night snack!

Pricy just like every other Asian place in Vegas but actually worth it.

It's rare to find a place with duck that is flavorful and made right ! 

Noodles and rice came out so quickly !! Dim sum takes a while so if you're really hungry avoid that."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere with dim sum carts for you to see and choose appetizers! We had chicken from the cart to start. Then split the house fried rice - good size portions of the shrimp, chicken and beef but lacking a little salt and enjoyed the pork/shrimp wonton soup. Average portions and a bit pricey but it is in a casino on the strip."}
{"text":"The best review a customer can give is a repeat visit. 3rd visit in 2 weeks. My favorite dishes are the House fried rice and won ton noodle soup. These common dishes exemplify their commitment to tasty food. Both are excellent. And... late night! 

The dim sum carts which staff roll around are pretty cool. BBQ pork buns and shiu mai were solid. 

This is an under rated lunch and late night gem."}
{"text":"My family ate at Yong Kang Street on New Year's eve. 

What I like about Yong Kang Street was that they were very accommodating. My sister and I are vegetarians (going vegan). The waitress told us that we could change the broth from beef broth to vegetable broth! Yay! This won a few extra points in my book. There weren't that many restaurants that offer this. The vegetable noodles were absolutely scrumptious. It's a good portion of food. It isn't as flavorful as other noodles that I have had, but if you add some sauce its pretty delicious. 

I also ordered the spring rolls. This were perfectly crisped. For two egg rolls, the cost was $5. What knocked one star off this restaurant was that the prices were steep. I believe for my vegetable noodles were $18. 

The waitress was very nice and the service was speedy. When we first arrived at the restaurant there was a line of about ten people. We were seated in 10 minutes or less. If you consider that it was New Years Eve, this wait time was excellent. 

This restaurant does have a Yelp offer. I wrote this review after my experience at Yong Kang Street. The waitress didn't ask me to write a review before in order to receive the free tea. The free tea did not sway me in writing a more positive review."}
{"text":"Gave this place a chance for dim sum, but definitely NOT good. The food tasted like something you buy in a box and microwave and that might be being generous. 2 stars since no complaints about the service."}
{"text":"This is a real find. Not often that you can find such a contrived, complete farce of a restaurant that you just think how does this place exist. Obviously it stays in business from having people that stay in the hotel go there for a quick bite hoping to catch some Asian comfort food. Do not be fooled. Jack from jack in the box must be cooking in the back. Or not cooking maybe. 
We stopped here just to grab a quick bite. We ordered a little dim sum. I should've known something was wrong when the dim sum got stuck to my chopsticks like glue. 
My wife ordered shrimp fried rice, and I ordered the roast duck and pork fried rice. 
The fried rice was the same except my wife's was topped with some precooked warmed up shrimp, and mine was topped with some dried up char siu fat. 
The rice was nice and crystallized with grease, triple green onions, and was pretty much inedible. The duck was kind of ok, but really not up to par with anything you could get anywhere. 
Oh yeah, my mother in law was with us too. She had questions about the menu because she wanted to know if there were any noodles that were just regularly seasoned and not with peanut sauce. Well. It sounds like peanut sauce is the name of the game around here. She ordered the sesame noodles unseasoned with shrimp. They just brought the peanut sauce on the side, and yea of course it was the same pre cooked shrimp warmed up like my wife's fried rice. Disgusting. Cmon. 
I was shocked. Pure trash. Don't do it!"}
{"text":"Hong Kong Wonton Noodle soup ($18.88) is where it's at!! The broth/veggies come in one large container. The pork & shrimp wontons come in another with the noodles. Ask for soy sauce and chili sauce to add in (it will come on the side). After 4 Vegas trips I finally got to try \"the noodle place\" and it's SOO good!! On this (the 6th trip) I knew I wanted it again but couldn't remember what I got. The young girl at the podium was SUPER helpful and patient. The Wonton Noodle soup was EXACTLY what I got last time and it's just as good as I remember. I'm writing this review because I didn't last time and hated not knowing what I enjoyed. Next time, I think I might try the Vegetable Noodle Soup. 

**I have had the noodles both drunk and stone-cold sober! They are delicious no matter your stage in the Vegas game ;)

Oh, and my husband got the Spicy Chili Wontons ($10) based on the cooks recommendations. The first 4 were GOOD! The last 2, the spice started to kick his butt. He finished them like a champ and said they were delicious too!!"}
{"text":"Very good fast food fried dumplings. My favorite when I'm staying at Paris Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Street food exactly replicated. We felt we got that racist treatment. But hell ya don't care we are in  Vegas  to have fun baby."}
{"text":"Loved it. Like Chinatown street food.  Yes stupid expensive but this is Vegas. Loved the dim sum carts they roll around. Dumplings very good, Peking duck crazy good. Ice cold Kirin on tap (yes I know that's Japanese) and very good service. Dandan noodles with bbq pork groin grabbinly good. Loved it all. Stuffed myself with way more food than I should have but don't care. Will go back."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot in Paris Hotel. It's close to hotel elevators. Service is great except the lady pushing the dimsum cart with siomai & etc. She's not that friendly, as if she is not happy with her job. 
Food is very delicious. We love the beef soup the most and it's good  for hangover. Roasted duck is one of our favorite too."}
{"text":"I had the udon noodle soup and a few dim sum dishes. The dim sum dishes were fresh and they constantly come around with the cart. A little pricey compared to regular dim sum but everything in Vegas is more expensive than the norm. The soup was also good but if I go again, I would just get the dim sum dishes. 
There was no wait for dinner on a Saturday night around 7, but it did start getting busier as I was there. Great for a sit down dinner with food that arrives very quickly and is right in the middle of the shops between Bally's and the Paris."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, great food... the spicy wontons had a perfect level of spice. This is a great stop in the Paris!"}
{"text":"A great gem in the middle of all the madness... I loved this little spot for so many reasons but the top three are: 
1. Delicious food 
2. Quick service 
3. Reasonably priced
Also I loved having dim sum on the strip it's so light (depending on what you choose) and authentic ; does not put you in a food coma..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Make sure you try the Dim Sum carts, the only ones on the Las Vegas Strip!"}
{"text":"Almost a 4-star, depending on one's mood & situation.

Even though I'm a CBC, and prefer non-Chinese food, after 3 days of heavy eating, chowing down on one's grass roots is a natural phenomena--I think lol.

So during my many frequents back and forth Paris/Ballys/Planet Hollywood, and passing by YKS and their super long lineups, my first initial glance is, 'nah, made for westerners, I can eat this stuff at home'...

Eventually curiosity got the better of me, and despite the high prices (which I can accept, it's vEgas, it's our crappy Canadian dollar), I just have to try it out.  Besides, mostly Asians were eating here, probably for the same reason lol.

First off, the veggies were great.  Bak choy at this stage, my body needs it.

Wonton noodle, pretty decent too.  And the broth wasn't as loaded with MSG as to be expected.

Roast duck, pieces-wise adequate in itself, and we're not exactly in Chinatown, so for $18, whatever.

now, we were totally impressed by the service, spoke Cantonese a few times.

Unlike other restaurants, it's OKAY to order just cold water--what's even cooler, is that they topped up a few times too.

Liked the picnic style seating along the wall.

Yes, long lineups as usual everywhere, and honestly, not worth the wait if you're short on time.

But a nice change."}
{"text":"I was so hungry when I arrived here on a Friday around 3:15pm. We were seated immediately and they came around with our drink orders quickly. The decor here is pretty awesome. Yong Kang Street is a Street in Taiwan so it was cool to get that vibe with the decor here. It felt like we were outside.

Shortly after getting our drinks the dim sum carts pulled up! One had appetizers then the next had dumplings and other varieties. We tried the soup dumplings, shu mai (pork and mushroom dumplings) and bbq bun. I asked for a menu of what they had on their cart and she told me that they didn't have a menu. I just wish I knew what they had on the cart. The shu mai was pretty good. I wanted to try their noodles so we ordered the Taiwanese Beef Noodle soup. It had a spicy sign on the menu next to it. If you have a high tolerance to spice, be sure to add the chili garlic to it. The soup was good and they weren't shy with the meat. 

The severs came by often to check in to see if we wanted anything. Overall, the dim sum was ok and the noodle soup wasn't bad at all."}
{"text":"This eatery has pretty good Chinese food despite being in a hotel on the strip. We ordered siu mai and pork spare rib from the dim sum cart and Shanghai lo mein from the server, (Lin is his name I think). 

The siu mai had a great taste to it without any of the sauces, (soy sauce and chili oil). The pork rib was in a black bean paste and the paste was very slight. I was hoping the paste would've been a bit more pronounced. 

The Shanghai Lo Mein we ordered was very good. We ordered it with duck. Lots of roasted duck and Vegas were in the in the lo mein. It had an awesome authentic Chinese taste too.

The service was great! Thanks Ken and Lin (?), but it was a bit pricey. Probably visit again."}
{"text":"Good restaurant.   Ordered the Taiwanese Beed noodle soup and BBQ pork fried rice.  Both were good. Service  was very fast too."}
{"text":"Poor service. Bad attitude. Especially a young waiter, never waited for me finishing my words. 

Worst Dandan noodles I've ever had.

Very expensive. Force you to pay high tips. Doesn't deserve it."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night with no reservation and we were seated immediately.

A cart comes around with fresh not appetizers. You pick what you want and the cart person puts it in your table.

For dinner I had the stuffed wonton dim sum. It was delicious and came out in under five minutes."}
{"text":"Super super overpriced! It was $18.88 for a normal sized bowl of noodles. We got 3 small dishes from the cart and a bowl of noodles, which came to $60! For Vegas, it's fine. But dim sum should never be that expensive."}
{"text":"I'd like to think of myself as a person who is very experienced with ramen. I have been to 10+ ramen places where I am from in LA. Directly from Little Tokyo itself. This was the worst ramen I have ever had! The broth tasted like literally salted water. No flavor at all. The pork chasu was unseasoned and very minimal. The only good part was the noodles. They tasted dense and fresh. For $20 for a bowl of ramen (absurd, should be $10) it was very disappointing. Just ate the noodles and left everything else. 
I happened to get some pork dumplings on the dim sum cart and they were very delicious! I'm thinking maybe dim sum is the way to go at this place and not off the menu. Most dim sum doesn't even have a menu so not sure why they have one. Whatever you do don't order the ramen!"}
{"text":"A restaurant that when busy you are not looked after by any server!
Would of ordered way more..but just a sigh.....
Mind you when we arrived the girl that welcomed us at the door was the best, polite, nice and smiled... which is more than what we got the rest of the night. 
Food was average, the duck did have a good quantity of meat on it which was a nice surprise.
The trolleys of food was not exactly hot, and when we asked waiter what the difference in ordering off the menu.. which works out cheaper.. 
He said nothing different.. all comes from same stack from kitchen.. Oh dear."}
{"text":"This restaurant is an embarrassment to the Paris Hotel. In the middle of Chef Ramsey's and Martorano's, really??? How did they even get in?
The food was horrible, I wouldn't even feed it to my dogs. I was served beef tongue in my beef soup. Why was it not on the menu description? The taste and smell alone was anything but pleasant.
The service was good, but seriously, the food, how can anyone on this forum say anything good about it? Relatives, friends? Surely they have to be.
I have been to several Asian places, and this is by far the worst I have ever been to, in fact, the worst food I have ever eaten in any restaurant all over the world. I hope Paris gets word of this and others that have left similar reviews. It has no business there, at all."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good dim sum late at night! It doesn't compare to any of my favorites in NY, LA, or even SF, but quite good for Vegas, especially the Strip."}
{"text":"*** Expensive and Tiny portions ***
Food were bland and below par level to any dim sum.
Ordered the following
Steamed Pork Spare Ribs, Spicy Chili Shrimp Pork Wonton Dumplings, Singapore Rice Noodles and Lobster or Shrimp Fried Rice. We also ordered Thai Ice tea and received normal ice tea. 
I do not even hjave one line to write about these items. Sorry to leave this review just blad like the food we had.
We paid more than $200 for 5 of us for eating nothing great. Will you go there still after reading this review, only if you will die soon because of starving."}
{"text":"On are way from one casino too the next we had stopped for bearings almost in front of this small eatery.  I was watching a couple choose through Dim Sum items,  the smell from all around was unbelievable.  We were seated two minutes later.  everything was good mind you but nothing really popped, or stood out."}
{"text":"I had the dim sum. I thought it was very good. A limited selection but very good steamed dumplings.  I ordered the scallion pancake and it was too greasy so I'd pass on that in the future but the dim sum was good. Sure it's cheaper to drive somewhere else but I was curious to try this."}
{"text":"Mike was great, provided us with everything we wanted. The food was great! Reasonable prices. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried a lot off stuff off the carts and menu. Everything was delicious and authentic. Took us right back to our trip to China and Japan. Service was great and quick despite them being busy and staff were friendly.

It is pricy but its the strip so to be expected"}
{"text":"Dimsum was ok, siu Mai had bigger ball and har gaw lacked personality ..although the trolley cart style is nice touch.
Bbq pork and roast duck noodle was also ok. The serving was huge and broth nice. 

Availed of the free drink by checking in via yelp . 
Wait staff was business like.. 

et oui it's definitely Paris price point !"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and delicious food what more could you ask for! Super fast too!! We got the dim sum"}
{"text":"Prices are the most ridiculous I ever seem. 

Mom demand for taiwanese food so have to try. 

Anyhow... the waitress dropped the menu on my head, didn't do anything about it; food takes forever to come.

Why come here at all?"}
{"text":"Hargow 3 on my meter.
Fried Dumpling 6 on my dim sum scale.
Shumai 7 on the scale of ten.
Service was a solid 9.
Overall economy of meal 5 a little expensive but considering I am dim sum spoiled this must be taken with a grain of salt.

Now as to the decor and ambience 9.5. I love the Asian hipster steampunk look this place has going on. The waitress and staff were awesome and very friendly. There was a roasted duck hanging in a glass oven in the front of the restaurant which tells me perhaps I should have had some duck soup instead of Dim Sum."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, mediocre dim sum, terrible prices. $10 for a bottle of Tsingtao? Wow."}
{"text":"Actually really good beef noodle soup. The service was very helpful honest and friendly. I dig that place"}
{"text":"Solid 4-star Chinese eats here!  We ordered a couple items off the dim sum cart and a noodle dish with duck.  Everything was tasty!

Service was excellent, our server always checked on us.

It's a bit pricy for dim sum, but given it's located inside the Paris hotel, it's not too bad.  

I only wish they made egg tarts as part of their dim sum menu."}
{"text":"Meh... that's how I would describe this place.  The Dim Sum selection was very limited and the waitress did a terrible job of explaining what was inside the dim sum.  When I asked what one of the dumplings was, she just replied \"tofu\".  I had to follow up to find out that it had pork and mushrooms inside.  I would be pretty upset if I ordered it thinking it was just tofu, especially if I was vegetarian.  This place is way over-priced at $50 for 4 orders of dim sum and 1 Taiwanese beef noodle soup.  On top of being overpriced, the service left much to be desired.  My water was never refilled although it was empty for the last half of my meal.  LV has plenty of better dim sum options and most will deliver to your room."}
{"text":"One of the few places that are not filled during holiday. You can find a table here almost any time - that is a huge plus. Other than that the food are really not great."}
{"text":"Very bad experience. I stayed at Paris and had a convention here for 3days so Yong Kang seems to be a quick eat place. The food was ok not good and not bad. Understand the price is high with being in the hotel and all. So I don't complain on that. 

However the reason I say it is a bad place is how they sneak in the service charge of 18% in even you are just 1or 2 person dining there. We ate there 2 times. The first time I went in for dinner and when the bill come I normally don't care how much it will be and just give the credit card. If the service charge is their rule for small party then I don't mind. However, the write that it will be for a big party 6 or more but they charge us anyway.  The worst thing was when the credit card slip come. It left blank on the tip line for people to add in again and no where to be found that they have already charged the tip. 

When we went eat there again next day during lunch we only order a little and we was really surprise of how much total it was.  So my wife look at the bill detail and found that the sneak in the service charge in again. We ask them that we only 2 person why we get charge the they said it is normal since they change the rule.  So we pay without extra tip this time and vow that we will never come back again. Bad business practice. Rip off customer. Food is expensive mediocre quality."}
{"text":"Okay service , but the quality of the soup and dim sum was poor. I was highly disappointed because I felt robbed knowing that everything was already overpriced to begin with. The atmosphere/setting was the only good thing about the experience."}
{"text":"Began our meal with some spicy chili wontons and ha gow. Ha gow delicious enough for me to get another order, lol. Oh, and chicken feet, which were pretty good too. Wouldn't order the chili wontons again. 

Went with the roasted pork noodle soup. Broth wasn't anything special and the pork was overcooked. 

Only thing I'd order again is the limited dim sum they have here, meaning I prob won't be back, lol. 

Waitress took a long time to finally come around to us, but once she did, she was on point with her service."}
{"text":"long story short, absolutely no reason to go here over noodle asia in the venetian.  

tawainese beef noodles was pretty weak.  broth was lacking.
wonton noodle soup, same story.  weak broth, only came with 4 wontons.
dim sum was subpar.  we tried the bbq pork buns (dry) and the har gow which fell apart.
the steamed dumplings were clearly boiled, and they didnt have the mango dessert which was on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food, was eating burgers the last couple of days and it was great to find this place. Love the food and had good spice to it. 

I order Pork Fried Rice and Pan Fried Dumplings, gotta try the Ramen or Soups next time. It looks like it was curing some hangovers at the next table."}
{"text":"Seriously yummy and fast! I've had Asian food around the globe and this is defo top 5! Definitely recommend. I had the ginger chicken and my sister had the duck fried rice. Both fabulous! Inside the Paris hotel-sit, eat, people watch!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, food is fresh and tasteful. They do serve a lot of food, so order appropriately. We tried different dumplings, $7 and $8 per plate, served from a woman pushing a little steam cart. We also had the pork fried rice and a chicken dish. It was all very good, but will order less next time. It would be helpful if they told you."}
{"text":"I wish I listened to the reviews because it's true...was ridiculously overpriced for mediocre food. 4 pieces of shumai cost about $7! I ordered the roast duck over rice which cost me $17. I was so underwhelmed, I had lots more rice compared to duck and my duck was all bone with little meat. The skin was soft and not crispy like a roast duck should be :(. My plate had loads of nappa cabbage on it, looks like a filler for the lack of duck. I also tried the wonton noodle soup which again disappointed me. It cost about $17 also. The broth was so bland I felt cheated. I had 4 pieces of wonton with heaps of nappa cabbage."}
{"text":"We ordered the Bbq combination duck and although the food arrived very quick the duck was cold. We also ordered shrimp rice which was very average. I was expecting to get decent food quality but i was wrong. It's definitely worth driving to china town and get good quality food for half of the price. 
I enjoyed the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant. They also offer dim sum options which makes your dining experience a bit better.
But overall, I was very disappointed with the food and I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal and friendly service. Glad that they stay open late. I love the music here."}
{"text":"Service was fine; they are clearly ramping up their efforts (little signs adorn each table asking diners to review them on Yelp.) But the food was bland. The sesame noodles were like spaghetti dragged through oily peanut butter. The veggie spring rolls were all right, but nothing spectacular. $21 for food but I also had two beers so my total came out to more than $40 for sub-par Chinese. Maybe the dim sum is where it's at?"}
{"text":"This place has a high price for mediocre Chinese food. If you don't have a car but have the time, walk over to Bellagio where they have high priced but rgood Chinese food. If you have the car and the time, head to Chinatown or even inside Gold Coast for great Chinese food for a third of the price or less. 

Alas, I had neither a car nor time and had to order to go to back to my room. I've given this place a few chances previously and have had a few items. The beef stew noodles were barely passable, but was too greasy. The lobster noodles were a farce, you get pieces of frozen rubbery lobster meat added to a low cost noodle soup and get charge what could be a whole lobster elsewhere already. Dim sum items were ok but costly. The only thing I figured out was consistently good was the roasted duck and BBQ pork items. 

BUT- they cheat you on the to go orders and give you meatless-skin-on-bone-only pieces. Figuring you couldn't be bothered to go back for replacement or complaints if you were in a hurry! So be sure to check before walking away."}
{"text":"The third time come here. I feel Very nice place. Service is very good Food is ok. The staff work here all Frendy. I like to enjoy Dining in here."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night after checking in, since it's the first restaurant you see after stepping out the elevators. I really liked it since they serve dim sum even that late. Food was mediocre at its finest but if I was drunk and lazy to walk anywhere, I'd eat here again. Lol"}
{"text":"Great place to dine in. My friends and I were strolling by after a night out and decided to eat here solely because we LOVE Asian food. Shrimp Har Gow dumplings were amazing. Their duck was tender and flavorful. There was no need for hoisin sauce which most places do offer. Most of all, the service is superb. Checked on constantly to make sure we were happy. Henry definitely adds a personal touch to the customer service like no other! Friendly man with a positive energy for someone who has to work very late. Thank you Henry!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located inside the Paris casino. We went with one of our Taiwanese friend. She told it that it was authentic Taiwanese food. OMG, she was right. The food here is really amazing, flavorful and authentic. They also have DimSum there too, really good.  Anyone that likes  \"Chinese\" food should definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"Came here on a week vacation. I mostly ate off the strip. Service was good and quick. Finally decide to try something inside the casino. Ordered the HK noodle soup with duck; out of all my years the worst noodles soup I ever had."}
{"text":"After a long day of hiking and gambling, we wanted some Asian soul food. Yong Kang is inside the Paris Hotel and Resort where we were staying. We went there out of convenience and laziness to leave the hotel. 

The restaurant shares air space with the casino floor. It's decorated to look like a food alley in Asia. It's quite appealing and reminds me of some places I have visited during my travels. 

We were seated immediately at dinner time, and was quick to order an appetizer out of their Dim Sum cart. We got  \"Ham Shui Gok\" which is a fried mochi-like dumpling with meat inside. I had no expectations coming to this place since most Asian restaurants inside casinos are mediocre and target non-asian foodies. I was impressed at the dim sum for it was comparable to some of the best I've tried. 

We ordered the Hong Kong Noodle Soup with Duck and the Taiwanese Sausage Fried Rice for our entree. Both dishes, to my surprise, were actually very delicious.

The Noodle portion was normal, but the fried rice portion was definitely small compared to what were used to. For the price we paid, we expected more in quantity. 

The Fried Rice and Noodles we're both about $17. The two Dumplings costed $5.88.

The only downside to this place is price, but you can't complain when it's literally outside of your hotel elevator."}
{"text":"Very difficult to tell you about the taste of the food as we could not get served. Our waiter brought us menus and water and then never returned. Everyone around us places their order and received their food while we continued to wait. It was around 10 pm and not that busy. When we walked out, the lady at the front who seated us just said bye and waved. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Service was bad & slow but food came fast. I loved the dumpling lady! She was great & recommend good choices! I'd would have preferred to just eat dumplings the whole time. Lol. But for reals this review is mixed. My husband liked the food but I didn't, I guess I prefer more sweet food. Also I didn't like how our server recommend the noodles with chicken but we ordered the noodles with BBQ pork & when the food arrived it was with chicken."}
{"text":"One star for the OK-Decent dimsum. The noodles and the rice bowl, disgusting! I would be ashamed as the owner of this place serving such horrible food!!!   
Do yourself a favor , there are so many other restaurants to eat at! I should of read the reviews first before coming here, cause I wouldn't have!"}
{"text":"I spent a year in Taiwan so when my wife saw this restaurant during a recent visit she had to take me there. This a close to what i ate in Taiwan. If you are looking for the sweet American style Chinese probably not your choice at least the food we chose. Dim sum carts had some nice chooses. I has roast duck. I got hooked to it while over seas. Duck was very good with great crispy skin. We also had Taiwanese beef noodle soup. Broth could have had a little more flavor but it was very good. Prices are high"}
{"text":"This is our new go-to place for noodles while in Vegas. Hubby and I shared the ramen with pork noodle soup and couldn't even finish it all. The broth was so full of flavor and the pork was delicious. Service was friendly and efficient. Will definitely return and try more menu items! (Note: if you enjoy people watching while dining casually, this is a great little spot.)"}
{"text":"If you like food poisoning come here! I ordered a soup to go. They didn't make it, but they had a completed different meal prepared that someone left and were so kind to give that to me. After sh*tting my brains out for a day, I came back and told one of the employees what happened. Instead of apologizing he personally attacked me and said I was full of Sh*t. I said no I'm not, I'm completely empty thanks to your restaurant. His name was MIKKY. I was not reimbursed. I should've looked at the reviews before coming here. Eat next store at the sushi restaurant. They're nice and the food is better."}
{"text":"Great dim sum, great atmosphere in the Paris food court... definitely get the pork dumplings!"}
{"text":"The food they bring on the cart is decent. The noodle are not. I had the hong kong duck noodle. Very plain broth and duck was off the grill but the broth killed the flavor.  I wouldnt go there again especially because of the 20 dollar a bowl of noodle price.  The noodles tasted like a packet of top ramen but worse.  Would not recommend unless everything else is closed or full."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO! Just a piece of shiiiiiiit!!!! I am Chinese, trust me! That's not Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Delicious !!! Shanghai noodles with barbeque pork is amazing.  I love the dim sum cart, different choices."}
{"text":"Most dissatisfying $75 meal of my life. The roast duck was overly salty and the noodle dish I got was bland with limited ingredients."}
{"text":"The food here is average ...AT BEST. 
As everyone else mentioned the Taiwanese beef noodle soup is good..but for $18?! Are you kidding me? I understand vegas has high prices but this is just absurd. The juicy pork dumplings were pretty gross and the vegetables were good but then again it's hard to mess up stir fry veggies. Again though for $14?! Ridiculous ... absolutely ridiculous pricing even for Vegas for what you're getting. Make the effort to take the extra walk and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Have been meaning to give this place a review... 

Probably one of my worst restaurant experiences. 
I came here to have a late dinner the first day we get into Vegas since we're staying at the Paris. When we were seated it honestly took almost 20-30 minutes for us to be acknowledged by the server. We ordered our drinks and that took another 10 minutes to show up. We placed our order for food and that took almost another 30-45 minutes. We saw several tables around us that just left because no one was taking their order. When we received our soup we were given plastic containers. The clear looking ones that you get hummus or dip in at the grocery store. We asked for hot sauce and the server gave us sweet and sour sauce. Under the impression it was hot sauce I poured a lot of it into my soup just o be disappointed at what it really was. I spoke with the manager about the lack of service and how I felt we were the only ones that received the plastic containers after having looked and walked around and she didn't seem to care for anything we had to say. 

With the dissatisfaction I even went to the hotel front desk and being a total rewards member I wasn't pleased with the service received with that restaurant. I was told that they would inform the F&B director but have yet to receive and feedback. 

If you love long waits horrible service then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I was shocked at how bad this place was - especially because it looked so good, it it was always crowded. The concept is great - with dim sum carts rolling along and lots of noodle dishes, mostly Taiwanese. 

However, in the end, not one dish was as good as any decent Chinese place in San Gabriel or Arcadia in So Cal, nor did it setttle as well. 

Besides being super expensive, at eight bucks per dim sum and over 10 for a small bowl of noodles... but I spent the entire next day on and off the porcellin throne. 

And it wasn't just me -- my friend who I went to Yong Kang with had the same problem.

I reall wish it was better. But FYI... Las Vegas has a great Chinatown - with good dim sum in carts on weekends and great Cantonese BBQ & Seafood places for dinner. There is also excellent Korean in Vegas. And the Chinatown is only 10 mins from the strip.

Bon Appitite."}
{"text":"I was lured in by the dim sum carts .. and actually had the noodle soup after checking out the menu.. 

I decided on the Taiwanese beef noodle soup.. it was delicious.. the meat was tender, noodles and beef broth complimented each other nicely.. I added chili paste for heat but didn't need it for flavor.

I used the Yelp check-in and enjoyed a Taiwanese iced coffee for free .. it was sweet & strong!! 

Great place for people watching .. I enjoyed the dim sum on a previous visit and it was also delicious!! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Slightly overpriced but expected because the restaurant is inside the Paris Las Vegas Casino. We both ordered the Taiwanese Rice Noodle Soup (with BBQ pork, and with Duck). Each bowl of Noodle soup cost around $16.50 (not including tax or tip).

The ambience of the place was nice and clean which I personally enjoyed. Everything looked new and decently clean.

The service was also very quick. We ordered  and within 5 minutes our food came out. We were in a rush so this worked out perfectly.

The taste of the food was average as it tasted like a huge scoop of sodium/msg was scooped into our soup. We both finished our water and later felt the \"sodium\" effects in our mouth.

Overall scenario: We arrived at the restaurant around 8:10pm and immediately got seated by the hostess, ordered and finished eating by 8:40pm. We were able to make it to our 9:00pm Britney show next door at the Planet Hollywood!

I probably will not come back here unless it was the only place open and I was in a rush or something. 

I don't have anything exceptionally good to say about the place other than quick service. The only had thing is there was a lot of sodium in the food which makes it quite unhealthy. Maybe we just ordered a bad dish..."}
{"text":"Attentive and fast service compared to surrounding restaurants. As soon as we sat down, we were approached by the wait staff for drinks and dim sum. Entrees are also turned around quickly. Also, we got the Thai Tea and Vietnamese Coffee, which quenched our thirst from the hot 100 degree weather.

Overall, the food is on par with any dim sum/Chinese bbq restaurant in the San Francisco Bay Area."}
{"text":"This is a reasonably good dim sum spot on the strip. Selection is very limited but most of what they have is acceptable. The xiaolongbao didn't have enough soup and wasn't served hot. Everything else was acceptable quality.

Food 2.5/5
Service 4/5
Decor 4/5
Value 2/5"}
{"text":"Went to bacchanal but there was a 2.5hrs wait!! Decided to check this joint.out instead since we were hungry.  This place is a def of 2 stars at best.  Service was extremely.slow not because they werent trying but 2 waiters for a place of this size is crazy.  The dim sum was good but very pricey for the ave taste.  The soup dumplings had super thick skins, the chili dumplings barely had and.meat, and the pan fried.dumplings was bland.  I would not.recommend.This place, keep om.waiting for ur fav spot"}
{"text":"Pho was waaay to salty and covered in sprouts.  Lots of breasts though. Chicken feet good.  Pork dim sum not good. Crab and shrimp dim sum good.
Sauces good.  Help was sketch.  Lobster fried rice not worth it.  A bowl of pho for $18 where I can get it for $8 in the bay.  Unlimited soda.  Not bad but needs improvement."}
{"text":"The food is pretty awful here. I had the Shanghai style noodles, and they were bland and flavorless. It was like they just boiled some water and threw some pepper on it and called it a day. The soup dumplings were mediocre as well--tiny, flavorless, with barely any soup. The service is so-so. As a Chinese person, I'm embarrassed that people come here thinking this is Chinese food. Take-out is better than this. Save yourself some money and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Sigh. Even worse than the typical casino \"Asian\".

I ended up here because I was checking out Paris (pretty meh, IMO) and I was interested by the dim sum concept. They advertised \"20 varieties\"'and perhaps that means that in sum total of the existence of the restaurant they have served 20 kinds. Because when I visited it was like 6 things - egg rolls, wontons, shrimp tempura, sesame buns etc. YAWN. I picked a chicken egg roll and it was served barely warm but tasted fine.

For dinner, I chose tonkatsu ramen and it was pretty terrible. The broth was off tasting, they used sweet BBQ pork (tough & gristly too) and added sweet corn? Wtf? It combined to be very odd indeed. I think it depends when you visit because I saw photos where regular pork was used. It seemed like they thought \"well, we got this gnarly ass leftover pork, let's use it because this girl won't know better\". 

Now, you might be thinking \"well, what did you expect, ordering Ramen in a French themed casino?\" And you would be right - that was a dumb move. Do not be stupid like me and order ramen - in fact, do not order any food here because it is not good.

What is good? Well, the wine prices were not bad for Vegas and the pour was strong. Service was great - really attentive. Still, unless you're craving what is essentially Panda Express, steer clear."}
{"text":"Taiwanese beef noodle soup was delicious.  The waiter suggested soup at the end of the night because it has been simmering all day and makes the soup base yummy.  He was right."}
{"text":"Food was good our waitress could have been more attentive.  The soup dumplings are awesome."}
{"text":"The past 36 hrs have been some of the worst of my life. My friends and I are in Vegas for a bachelorette party, having a great time until we decided to stop here. 
First the hostess uses the Dim Sum (overpriced) to draw us in and then gives us menus trying to get us to pay an average of $20 for a low quality entree. We finally get the Dim Sum we requested; it tasted ok, not great. We go out for the rest of the night and by the next morning all of us are sick. Food poisoning destroyed our entire day and ruined the rest of the weekend."}
{"text":"$19.99 for beef noodle soup ? Ha ha ... It's just better go china town to eat other beef noodle soup ! After I had this beef noodle soup I felt super thirsty for whole afternoon . I was super regret why I picked this place to eat !! The service was ok !!! 

My advice : 1. Save your money to go China town to eat better noodle with fair price . 

2. Don't even try the Dim sum !!!"}
{"text":"With one look at this place, I was needing to try it! And I'm glad I did!! So delicious. Ordered the Taiwanese Style Beef soup and a noodle dish with bbq pork. Both very good and flavorful. I personally added more soy sauce and chili paste to the noodles and they tasted amazing. 

The price was a bit high but of course, you're in Vegas. But for the portion and taste, it honestly was worth it.

The restaurant also had servers with little carts on wheels that slowly maneuvered through the small paths between tables. We grabbed some crispy, deep fried, chicken egg rolls and the sweet bright red dipping sauce. Yum. The flavor was great. They don't have much chicken inside, more of a type of clear noodle but still tasted great when dipped in the sweet sauce. I would order that again. 

The staff are also very nice and was greeted, seated, and drinks ordered very quickly!"}
{"text":"I was walking to my car when I smelled the restaurant. Like other reviews, the aroma smelled so good which enticed me to try the place. The prices were expected to be pricey because it was located in the Paris hotel. I ordered the wonton noodle soup , priced at $18.88. It was fresh and tasty. I am giving the rating 2 stars because the service was terrible. The waiter was rude and inpatient to me when I asked him menu questions. I was solo and the place was not busy at 1 am. Honestly, the only person nice to me was the busser who was helpful and packed my leftovers and gave me a water to go."}
{"text":"Definitely go there again when I am down to Las Vegas. Try Taiwanese noodle soup and beef fried rice. They are authentically delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try a noodle place and came across this restaurant while exploring the Paris casino.  It was around 11pm, which is apparently considered late night, even in Las Vegas, because the late night limited menu is what was available.  When we were seated, we were the only ones in the restaurant.  The seating area is nice, it's supposed to feel as if we're sitting outside on a Parisian patio, which it did.  Our server was helpful in explaining what our choices were on the menu, which were basically noodles and meat with peanut butter sauce, or noodles and meat in soup, as well as the dim sum cart.

I decided on the shrimp noodle soup.  It was just over $20, which seemed odd for one person, but I figured it must be an amazing noodle soup.  The dim sum cart lady came by and explained the dishes, although her English wasn't great and I only had a very basic understanding of what the dishes were, having never eaten dim sum.  I ordered the shrimp sticky rice balls (2 for $7.88) and she put them on the table and stamped our card.  They were okay, kind of weird tasting, and I wouldn't order them again.

My soup came out not long after and was basically a bowl of ramen noodles, 6 or 7 shrimp, green onions and cabbage.  (They had apparently forgotten I asked for no cabbage, although they remembered no cilantro).  The broth was pretty flavorless and really just tasted like water.  I had to add soy sauce and the spicy red sauce from the table to make it enjoyable to eat.  Honestly, homemade Top Ramen noodles in the plastic package at the grocery store is much more flavorful and way cheaper.

Our server was attentive until I got my food, then she was nowhere to be seen.  Keep in mind there was only one other table occupied in the entire place.  I had to flag down the manager who was chatting with other servers to ask for the check.  When he brought it, I had been charged for two portions of dim sum, even though I clearly only had one.  Then I had to wait to flag down our server and wait for her to fix the check before we could pay and leave.  $30 for a flavorless bowl of soup and rice balls was way overpriced, even for Vegas.  Try one of the other noodle places in Vegas!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place out.
Never had dimsum before. They have fried food cart and steamed food cart. Very different experience. It could of been 5 star for their good food and atmosphere but last minute impression let them loose one star.  Server was standing in front until we were tipping them for the credit card transaction. Pretty much was pressuring on tips. Server could of got 10 dollar tip on 50 check but I tipped him 8 for making me feel awkward"}
{"text":"New Chinese dim sum place inside the Paris Hotel. I'm shocked they have dim sum at this hour.

I was forced to eat here while i was waiting for my buddies to arrive at the Paris Hotel.

I was pretty impressed and drawn to the place since I noticed they served Dim Sum in the evenings, which is not normal for a Chinese restaurant.

I ordered the brown rice, which was so freaking dry i couldn't even eat it with my chopstick, the hagaw and siomai  tasted like they were old, dry and had no flavor. But I did not stop there, since i was already there i decided to have the hong kong style wonton soup which was $14 for freaking soup! The wonton soup had thin noodles which felt like it was never ending, and the wontons had shrimp inside them, the broth was okay nothing special. After i got the bill i had a bad taste in my mouth! The food was pricey and not as good as dim sum restaurants in china town. I felt like we were paying for the ambiance just because it was inside the Paris hotel, The reason why i gave this place a 3 star was because the service was great, not your typical Chinese restaurant that's for sure! If only they cooked like your typical Dim Sum restaurant I would have given them a 4 star.

Overall, I may go back to try their other soups, their service was great, ambiance was nice , wonton soup was okay.  i did not enjoy my dim sum at all because it was too pricey and the quality was not good at all."}
{"text":"When I go to Las Vegas, I typically do not seek out Chinese restaurants to visit, especially when I am staying on the Vegas Strip. I was with my friend who craves going to Chinese restaurants. I am one of the few folks who will go with her.

We saw Yong Kang Street at Paris Las Vegas and decided to do an early dinner there before catching a show. We went with dim sum. We sat outside the restaurant that was sort of a patio, but fenced in. It made you feel like you were indeed having street food.

Since this area was rather narrow, we didn't have too many carts with dim sum goodies being rolled to us. Rather, we marked what we wanted on a itemized menu with a pencil and the food came to us. We liked this method, as it allowed us to figure out what we wanted.

The dim sum quality was amazing. It tasted authentic. My friend doesn't eat pork, so I went crazy with pork-filled dumplings and other pork items. Naturally, we shared seafood, beef, and chicken dishes.

The most notable dim sum item that we loved the best was the crab claw. It was a generously sized crab claw with the perfect crunch. It was by far the yummiest crab claw that I have ever had in my life. It should be. It ran $8 for a single jumbo crab claw!

We ordered a lot of items. The prices at this restaurant are steep. You have been warned! What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, including how much we paid for our food.

If you feel like treating yourself or have won a large sum of money at the craps table, this place is for you. If you are on a budget, I would recommend going someplace else.

{"text":"Average Vegas prices with yummy beef noodle soup and our favorite pork soup dumplings and spicy dumplings, very much like Din Tai Fung! Would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted a quick lunch after some time at the Paris pool.  We also wanted to try the dim sum.  After some confusion in communication, we tried examples of the dim sum which overall were good but overpriced.  We tried the chicken with ginger as a main entree.  What a waste of money!!  There was little chicken and no flavor.  Service was pleasant and somewhat helpful.  I will not eat at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Dim Sum in Vegas? And at Paris? Could it be any good? The answer is astoundingly yes. It was fantastic. I usually have to go to Monterey Park (in Los Angeles) to get Dim Sum this fresh and delicious. 

The Shiu Mei and Har Gow were flavorful and fresh. I also had the tonkatsu ramen (with a nice hardboiled egg) and was slurping up the garlicky broth to the last drop."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place and saw they had dim sum so we sat! The hostess was super rude and looked annoyed when we asked to sit at a different table (even though the place was quite empty). We ordered a bunch of dim sum and the duck. We loved the dim sum (or fav was the shrimp and soup ones). And we like the authentic cart and style of the place. The duck was pretty good but being from Chicago it doesn't compare to some of the places we have there. It's a good stop for some dim sum before
You go to a big Vegas dinner."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was overpriced and subpar. The ambiance was nice and relaxing, but I would not go back again."}
{"text":"It's a delicious restaurant! Morning tea is very authentic! If you have a Chinese stomach, be sure to try it."}
{"text":"All I gotta say is What the?! Maybe it's because we came so late after drinking and gambling we came here about 11:30pm on a Wednesday, they seated us right away but the server ignored us for about 15mins before bringing us water then we waited another 15mins to order. I ordered dandan noodles and I said to my husband you want to share? The server must if heard me and assume we were sharing and walked off before my husband can even answer by the way no he didn't want to share but oh well. The noddles came and all I can taste was peanut butter! I mean they must of put a soup spoon full on the dish! Weirdest dandan noodles I ever had. End story we had a few bites, paid and left to our room hungry, never again will we stop at this place."}
{"text":"Youngkang Street is a foodie and night market paradise in Taipei. While this store in The Paris doesn't come close, it's a nice dim sum spot on The Strip. 

I loaded up with a savory bowl of Shrimp and Pork Wontons and Noodles. Add a plate of BBQ Pork, it was a satisfying meal. FenFen, my server was great and enjoyed her charming chatter. 

The dumplings were firm and flavorful. Hand pulled noodles are done right. 

Yes, a bowlful is 5x more than what you'd pay for in Taipei, but to enjoy them in Paris is a worthwhile stop."}
{"text":"Even for the hefty $20 price, the Taiwanese beef noodle soup still manage to hit the spot. Save your money and avoid the pricey dim sum though. It looks tempting, but it's mostly disappointing."}
{"text":"5/5 for ambiance
5/5 for service 
2/5 for food

Tl;Dr service, and ambiance is great. Food is meh, excessive herbal flavor is used to make it \"authentic\" tasting. 

The restaurant's design is stunning. I love the design of the walls to look old school and rustic. However the booths are odd, you gotta slide in still, don't expect to just enter it like you normally would. 

Service was nice, nothing to complain about. I was able to do the yell check in with no hassle, unlike other yelp reviewers. Maybe something changed? Just keep in mind you can choose from Vietnamese coffee, Thai tea, and milk tea.

Ordered dim sum and 4 different noodle soups, Hong Kong style, Taiwanese style; egg and rice noodles styles. 

All the soups were very \"herbal\" and have a very strong taste. However, it can definitely overpower the contents of the dish and it ends up killing the flavor of the noodles and meat. 
Dim sum wise, tsu Mai was fine, however everything else didn't taste authentic at all, felt like they made everything \"authentic\" by putting an excess amount of Chinese herbs and seasonings. 

Overall, it's not bad of a place but for everything to be around $18 or so per dish is excessive and maybe exploring somewhere else isn't such bad of an idea."}
{"text":"We showed up starving for a late supper. Unfortunately, they were out of Thai tea, iced coffee, tea with milk...all of the drinks I really wanted. We ordered a pot of hot green tea and being suuuuper hungry were delighted when a dim sum cart showed up. We got the meatball, the shrimp and pork dumpling and the pork bun. All of them were superb. Hot and fresh and flavorful. 

I ordered the BBQ pork fried rice an my husband ordered the Taiwanese style spicy beef noodles. My fried rice was out of this world. His soup was awful, bland, the noodles were thick and gooey and the beef was touch and stringy with big chunks of fat. The waiter noticed quickly that he was devouring my meal and had pushed his to the side and was quick to offer to get him something different. He went with the BBQ pork noodles and they were delicious. We left very happy. I almost knocked a star off because of them being out of the drinks we wanted and his awful first soup. But the service was so good and the replacement soup more than made up for the first bowl of soup that was disliked."}
{"text":"Food was pretty average- not especially tasty or fresh. The prices were way too high for what was served. At least they provided good service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located inside the Paris hotel. My husband and I were looking for a place to have dinner and I was originally set on a Parisian style restaurant, but I couldn't pass up this cute restaurant. I'm a sucker for atmosphere. We were quickly seated and greeted by our waiter. I noticed that our table was quite wobbly so I folded up a napkin and placed it under a leg of the table. A worker saw me do this and alerted other workers to come fix our table. About 3 people rushed over to help out. We weren't very bothered by the wobbly table but they insisted on fixing it and even told us we could move. We greatly appreciated the help.

If you check in on Yelp, you get a free beverage. Normally it's one offer per table but our waiter said because it was New Years, we could each have a free drink. We choose the Vietnamese coffee. It was sooo good. I love strong coffee. We also ordered some juicy pork dumplings as an appetizer. These dumplings are filled with a broth. These are a must! We were sitting next to a worker on break. She saw me looking perplexed about the condiments on our table. She kindly informed me what each one was. 

For our entrees, my husband ordered the a Japanese ramen and I ordered the Vietnamese beef noodles. It was so much food. We were so stuffed by the end. Menu items were reasonably priced for Vegas. Also, it's nice that they have a variety of Asian food on their menu. Our waiter and all the workers were so friendly and attentive. We were very impressed by the great service, food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite before going to see a show at Bally's. It was just inside the easy indoor passage way that links the Paris Las Vegas Hotel with Ballys so that was super convenient. I ordered a soupy noodle dish with duck and my wife had the pork over rice. We also split an order of pot stickers. My noodles were delicious as was the pieces of duck although I would have liked it had my pieces not been so boneheads. The pork over rice was even better it was ground pork nicely seasoned with Chinese five spice and it had sacallions tossed into it as well. 
We were also tempted by the dim sum cart that came around but we opted to just stick with what we ordered. Given that it was an eatery in a first tier hotel on the strip the prices were a little on the higher side but not cost prohibitive. I would definitely go back I would just order what my wife did."}
{"text":"Food was good but pricy, usually 7-9  dollars for a dim sum, and 16-20 for an entree, and considering their portion, it is pricy. Average 40 per person. But the dim sum and noodles worth it.

However, the service needs to be improved. 1st time got soup on my pants while the waitress was trying to take the plates away without any notice while I'm working on another dish, got offered 20% discount fine. 2nd time was forced to buy more dim sum than we need, because they were literally threw dim sums on your table and let you to try them, while keep saying the dim sums were good!

4 stars for the food, 2 stars for the price, 0 for the service."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical of this place as I was really hungry and have never had much of an appetite for soup-type meals, but I was pleasantly surprised.

First and foremost, incredibly friendly and attentive staff. We were seated immediately and were helped with the menu since we are not too familiar with Vietnamese cuisine. I ended up ordering the Vietnamese Iced Coffee and the Pork Ramen and Pork Dumplings. All items were prepared to perfection and I was completely satisfied. I left full, caffeinated, and content with my experience.

A unique restaurant experience if you are tired of buffets and burgers in Vegas!"}
{"text":"One of the few places where you can get your Asian food fix. The restaurant is in the Paris hotel and has Dim Sum"}
{"text":"Great service. Quick but tasty food. The setting is nice - it's inside but feels al fresco. Great option of dim sum and plates dish."}
{"text":"The service was good and the food was portioned well.  The pork fried rice had good flavor, but needed a bit of soy sauce to tie it together.  The Thai chicken fried rice was good but chicken could have had a little more flavor.  It was basic shredded chicken that would be similar to that found in chicken noodle soup.  Overall, the atmosphere was nice and the place was pretty clean!"}
{"text":"I would give lower stars just for the service of the receptionist. Food wise and the actual server/waiter were good.
We just walked in, and we were the only ones waiting in line and the lady mentioned 30 min wait and she said to write our name down. Then we thought about it and we're like ok we can write down the name, then she is like you just have to be here we don't take names. I asked her how many people in front of us, and she said it's just us. Then finally she said we are next so it should just be 5 minutes. We got the table in less than 5 minutes........  But just the way she was talking was like she doesn't want business and she could have mentioned we're next anyways instead of all the discussion above.

3/4 of us are vegetarian, but 4th person who ordered dim sums really liked them. I ordered fried rice and it's like any other fried rice so I can't complain. Other vegetarian food were average so it's probably more for dim sums."}
{"text":"Dim sum was very good, however the main courses were just bland and unedible. I have had better food at a hospital."}
{"text":"The service was very bad. We waited about ten minute until a waiter finally came to our table. We came here for dim sum but the choice was very limited. They only have 2 carts, steamed and fried. What makes it worse is that the waiter serving the cart wandered around inattentively and chatted with each other.. We literally had to walk to them to get our food. However, the food itself is okay. I actually like their shrimp shumai. Also, their Hong Kong style ice tea was authentic, if you've never had one, definitely try it. ( I've been to Hong Kong for more than 10 times)"}
{"text":"Yummy Authentic dim sum, beef noodle and Dan Dan Noddle!!!! Will come back next time!"}
{"text":"Asked them if there are eggs in their product (since I'm deathly allergic) and server said he didn't know and suggested I try their fried rice. JUST SO YOU KNOW fried rice is made with fried eggs. I simply got up and left and just said \"sorry\". #sorrynotsorry"}
{"text":"I really do hate to write negative reviews.  I rather not say anything at all than write a bad review especially for a restaurant in Paris where overall all the restaurants are top notch, including the buffet.  With that being said though I'm hoping that they take this to heart and improve.  My husband wanted to order white rice to go and maybe a few other things but the hostesses were simply unhelpful.  First, they said that they don't do to-go orders after 10 p.m. but it was 9:45 p.m.  So they let him order.  Then we asked what do you get for the different prices of dim sum- crickets...they had no idea.  We asked if they had siu mai- no idea.  Asked how much har gau was...not a clue.  And best yet they didn't even want to go to the dim sum cart to find out.  So, we got our $3.88 order of white rice; our $8.88 har gau (which is a RIP OFF); and, some pork dumpling thing that she insisted was siu mai (IT WAS NOT).  Educated your staff as to the food you serve.  Sad..."}
{"text":"Probably the saddest excuse for Chinese food. Ever. Being from arguably the most ethnically diverse place food wise (NYC), I was sorely disappointed with the quality, quality and the pricing of the food. I ordered the BBQ pork rice which is Chinese style roast pork over rice ($15.88). The bowl was primarily rice and had bunches of parsley and Chinese lettuce to cover up how little food there actually was in the dish. Overall, there was about five small slices of tasteless, bland and cold roast pork in my bowl. With tax and tip, my bill totaled $20.00+."}
{"text":"Vegas prices, so prepare yourself for sticker shock. The dim sum didn't look that great but the ladies pushing the cart were nice. All of the servers were friendly and attentive too! The decor is neat as well, and most of the seats have good vantage points for people watching.

A pair of chicken egg rolls was $7, and not really better than what you can cook from frozen. The spicy chili wonton dumplings were amazing! Tasted really fresh and delicious. The menu says pork, but they also contain shrimp, so be advised. I also had the dandan noodles with chicken, and I did like them quite a bit. Never had dandan noodles before so nothing to compare it to, but it was spicy and flavorful. The chicken was just shredded white meat added on top of the noodles, but there was plenty of sauce to keep the meat from being dry.

I'd say skip the dim sum and go for the noodles to fulfill your drunken carb cravings."}
{"text":"Just what we needed!  Tonkatsu pork ramen, udon noodles and dim sum.  Like alfresco dinning.   Perfect.  Nice service and tasty tea"}
{"text":"Not that great at all. The only thing good is....the place is convenient to those who want some Asian noodle soup and dumplings. Otherwise, I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Friends and I were looking for dim sum, we were thinking Chinatown but we rather spend our time on the strip and found this place on yelp. Decided to try it out and we were not disappointed, it was cart style and at a good reasonable prices.
Mike hooked us up and made our bachelor night dinner a success!!! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I will give zero star if I can. Bad service. Dim sum is just so so. Rice noodle is the worst I ever have in the restaurants----a few and very very short noodle and 3 fish balls (which  taste like the one I buy in any market)."}
{"text":"It was good for a quick lunch. The food tasted good not great, the service was decent, but we felt that there may have been too much salt or MSG I don't know if there was any. Noodles, veggies were good. Pork was funky."}
{"text":"This place is such a rip off.. There's almost no dish under $10 and the quality of the food is just average, we ordered a beef noodle soup and the shredded chicken over rice, the beef noodle soup was ok and the chicken rice was way too watery that I thought I was eating a bowl of congee, traditional Taiwanese shredded chicken over rice is not supposed to be this watery!!! The taste of the rice is ok though and the service is good so I give it a 3 stars, will I come back? Probably not."}
{"text":"2 in the morning I was craving some noodles but didn't want to drive to Chinatown from our Paris room. Decided to go downstairs to try this place out. It definitely was good but with eye-gouging prices!! I understand it's the conviences of it and the restaurant is inside a hotel but for two bowls of noodles it cost 50$ with tip. Which is outrageous for noodles. I recommend the spicy beef noodle soup because it was good. If you're  really craving Asian food at 2 am while in Paris try it out."}
{"text":"We stopped here to avoid lines at other places and since we really enjoy dim sum, dumplings and noodles we thought this we be a great meal. Well, everything was just ok. Dumplings were a little bland, dim sum items were a little cold, and overall we just wished it would've been better. Probably wouldn't recommend stopping here unless you are super craving it and you don't or can't wait to find another place. We'll keep looking next time for sure."}
{"text":"What an overpriced disappointment. The food was flavorless, except for the Sprite and the shrimp tempura sauce. The atmosphere is nice that's about it. Run, don't walk away."}
{"text":"Great ambience, really great selection of Taiwanese food and dim sum. The beef noodle soup and lobster fried rice were fantastic. Came and ate here two days in a row because it was so good."}
{"text":"Well I had hoped to be one of the 5 star reviewers on this place to bring their rating up, sadly I can not. The greeters were not very friendly and were even annoyed when I asked to see the menu. Apparently it is on the wall and I just did not see it. She pointed and said it's over there as usual. Ok, excuse me for not being a usual I'm pretty sure Vegas isn't for usuals is what I should have said. I looked over the menu and wanted soup so I decided to dine.

Once at our table they asked for our drink order I mostly only drink water so I asked for that and she said you don't want anything else to drink? I said just water please. She walked away. Another lady came over asked for our order, we ordered soup with beef and rice noodles and shrimp fried rice. It took about 15 minutes to get our food. 

The soup was pretty good, not the best I've had, but good. The beef they used in the soup was great with the first bite but the rest of it was all fat barely any meat. the noodles are my favorite. However, there was not enough noodles in the soup. I asked if we could have more noodles and she said sure. She brought back a totally different type of noodle and left. She never came back, I had to flag her down to let her know we needed a refill and that our shrimp fried rice was not good and we would like to send it back. She said \"It's good why don't you like it?\" I told her it tasted weird and we would just like to have it removed.  She rolled her eyes and walked away! A totally different lady brought our check over and it still had the rice on it. I asked her to please have it removed $14.99 for something I could not eat no way was I paying for that! She fixed it and came back, I thanked her and placed my card in the slot to pay. It took them another 10 minutes to come back with it. 

Bad service and over priced so I do NOT recommend this place"}
{"text":"Delicious food both from the dim sum cart and from the menu. The service was extremely fast as well. The music was louder than I'd like for a dinner atmosphere, making it harder to hear our conversations. I'd still go back if I'm ever around."}
{"text":"My second time at this restaurant, and it was great!! Food was fantastic but the service was even better! Waiter Michael is an asset to this place! Thanks for making another great experience !"}
{"text":"Three stars for the food quality and friendly service.  Dumplings we tried were pretty good and our server was pleasant. However, there were only 2 carts of dumplings the entire time we were there so I was bummed about the lack of variety. For example, the only had baked bao, no steamed (that is pretty much a dim sum staple)."}
{"text":"Exactly what we were looking for!!! The dim sum was wonderful! Had all the great main dim sum dishes. Nice for a late night nibble."}
{"text":"We were staying at Bally's and were looking for a place to eat a light lunch nearby. 1 adult, 2 seniors and 3 children including added gratuity came to $157. No senior discounts. The decor  resembles a street scene in a Hong Kong action movie in the 80's. The long tables by the wall had bench seating on both side which was hard for my mother to get in and out of. The Vietnamese noodles were tasteless and did not come with hoisin, basil or bean sprouts. The Taiwanese beef noodle was good, not spicy as advertised, the meat was soft and tasted like oxtail. The summer special stir fried udon with bbq pork was heavy on the sesame oil and just ok. The shu mai and har gow were forgettable. The egg tarts were good but overpriced for two (better in San Francisco). Best thing- they had baked char siu bao which my husband and the kids enjoyed as snacks. Ok if you are desperate for dim sum and have a lot of money to spend."}
{"text":"It's great food for a midnight snack however it's quite expensive for what it is ($20/soup). My husband had the Japanese miso soup and I had the Wonton noodle soup. Both delicious but on the expensive side."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out because it was conveniently located near the elevators in Paris, and didn't feel like making reservations. We were seated immediately, and the dim sum cart appeared next to our table immediately. It was a little overwhelming, since we had just sat down, but everything looked good. We ended up grabbing some tasty egg rolls off the next cart that came by. I ordered Japanese Ramen that was great, girlfriend ordered beef noodles. Prices are high at about $18-$20 for a bowl of noodles, but pretty standard for anything on the LV strip."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my meal here. 10/10; I highly recommend the juicy dumplings. Secret menu: order them extra juicy, they are amazing you must order them extra juicy."}
{"text":"A small \"streetside\" cafe inside the Paris serving a variety of Asian Dim Sum, noodles, veges, and soups.  Fast, hot and delicious. We really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"They come around with a cart of tapas. That is super cool, because it is already ready and you do not have to wait. The other food also came on very quickly. I had the shrimp tempura udon- although it was good, it is very salty. The service was good, and the ambiance is nice."}
{"text":"Love love looooovvveee! I finally get to give a review about this place. If you're on the strip and want some good noodles or dim sum, this is the place to go. I am pretty obsessed with their Hong Kong Style Noodles. I love how simple and delicious the broth is. You can choose your meats for it. Chicken, Pork or Duck. I got it with the duck and it was delicious! We also got a few orders on the cart. Shrimp dumplings and chicken feet. It was good! Can't complain about shrimp dumplings. The outside consistency wasn't too doughy which make it even better to eat. Not too thick and was the perfect amount for the chopped up shrimp. My mom ordered the wonton soup with noodles. For someone who wasn't hungry, she finished it lol. That mean, it was good! Freshly made and service was on point!! I love the quick service. You didn't have to wait long for a server to come by and you got the food pretty quickly. They are great! You must try the spicy dumplings. Dip every piece of dim sum in that sauce. I would even put it on my rice if I ordered some. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I come Las Vegas many times. Finally I find my favorite Chinese restaurant. The Taiwanese Style Beef Noodle Soup tasted so good. My friends just ate it before took photo. So I can't share with you. I ordered barbecue pork and duck. The meet tastes flavorous. Yong Kang street is very good restaurant in Paris Casino."}
{"text":"Ok so I forgot to take a photo since I was really hungry and it was really late. Landed in Vegas at 10:30 got to hotel Paris and finally got some food and brought it up to our room at midnight. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. We only got one dish to share, the dan dan noodles with Bbq pork. It was really good. Peanut buttery noodles with chili sauce on the side. It had bean sprouts and was very flavorful. I wasn't expecting much given the reviews but I thoroughly enjoyed it and so did my husband. We will probably get it again before we leave."}
{"text":"Super hungry for some quick snacks at 2 am what is there to complain about 

Food was hot and and service was fast 

Tea was boiling 

Perfect way to end the night"}
{"text":"Don't get the Taiwanese beef soup.

The fried rice platters were ok, totally not worth $20.

If you're going to get the fried rice, make sure to get the lobster for only $22.

To get a good flavor going on, we had to drench our fried rice with sriracha.

The Thai tea and HK tea are not worth the $6 price tag."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic find. We sat down and the Dim-Sum cart descended upon us. Didn't understand 1/2 the stuff that was presented to us, but we ordered and enjoyed it all. They have a menu as well, we added noodles. Yumbo! Can't say what dessert is like as we ordered to much and were full. So perhaps start with 3-4 dishes and decide as you near the end if you want more. The staff was friendly, giggled a lot and were quite attentive. So be not afraid, go out of your comfort zone and enjoy."}
{"text":"This was one of two places we came to for dim sum as my aunt & uncle had been here a year ago & raved about it.  It is a busy place with friendly & attentive service & some great Taiwanese dim sum & cuisine.  We had dim sum for dinner; it was excellent but limited being that it was dinener.  You have two waitresses coming around, one with steamed items & the other with fried & baked items including desserts.  The shrimp won ton is crispy & greasless with suculent seasoned shrimp; perfect with the sweet & sour sauce.  The crab balls are crispy with a wonderful crab filling & the shrimp dumplings also crispy with a well seasoned shrimp filling; both perfect with the formentioned sweet & sour sauce.  The juicy pork dumplings aka xiao lung bao are wonderful, I will be it very small than what you are used to at other restaurants; stioll, the wrappers are delicate with a well seasoned pork filling.  The sesame balls are crispy, coated with sesame seeds & filled with smooth red bean paste.  The egg custard tarts are some of the best yet, very flaky & creamy; my aunt especially raved about them, having owned a bakery with her family growing up.  Round it off with a Ching Dao & you will not be disappointed.  I deinitely be back to try the main dishes next time & go for dim during lunch when there is always more avalable.  So, for wonderful Taiwanese dim sum in a casual atmosphere with friendly service at reasonable prices, Yong Kang cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"When you need Dim Sum you need Dim Sum. Service ok, staff friendly... The menu states that they have over 20 varieties of Dim Sum. The carts had only a few. Like 5/6 different ones I chose twice (because I was hungry.)

My husband did ask for duck and they said they can make a \"dim sum\" style order special for him...and it was char su. lol

I absolutely love the decor though. Nice vibe and they did fill my water without me asking. I really like that (that is why it's 3 starts) other than that it would be a 2."}
{"text":"I'm Taiwanese.   This place is a no go.   Food not too fresh,   beef noodle soup noodles are horrible and chalky and chewy for $20???   Beef is tough and chewy.   Go to Ping Pong Pang. MUCH BETTER. If you want authentic real Chinese look at the people eating there.   No Asians???  No eat there.   Bad sign.   Food no good."}
{"text":"OK...  I haven't read prior reviews about this place bit I'm staying at Paris and just wanted to do a decent evening snack on the cheap.    ordered the spicy chili wontons which were OFF THE HOOK for only 10.88 and the steamed pork dumplings for 9.88.  All I can say is DAYUM.  The service from Mike was also tops.  Give this dude a raise.  He's good for business.  Makes me want to come back and explore all the potential goodness on this menu."}
{"text":"Two and a half stars for this noodle and dim sum place located in Paris. (Read below for more info why it he review is 2 stars and not 3)
 High traffic area and average food.

Noodles: just as anything you could find in a typical chinese restaurant off Spring Mt road. 
Broth: flavorful but overly salty.

One more thing, staff told me I could earn Total Rewards points by going to TR counter. That didn't work out."}
{"text":"A nice find in the Paris casino.  The service is amazing and the food is wonderful so much food and a nice treat healthy !!"}
{"text":"The food here is really bad. That pho is not pho. The BBQ pork is cold and dry. Not even worthy of late night drunken eating. 

Service was excellent and fast so bonuses for that. The bad Asian food came fast!"}
{"text":"Outrageous prices for flavorless dim sum.  My ramen was overcooked and also had no flavor.  Maybe this is a kitchy place to try out for folks who have never had dim sum - but don't let this sway you from never trying it again.  Dim sum should be a great experience of trying out samplings of delicious food at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Good place...I really like the Dim Sum type atmosphere with the rolling carts.  Service was very good, didn't eat anything but the dim sum...I've tried many places including china town on west coast and in NY....pretty authentic dim sum, not the greatest selection but enough to make me happy.  overall good, ate there 3 times while staying at the hotel"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Asian spot on the strip. If you've had a bit to drink, and need some quality healthy food for your demolished soul, come here and to re-energize to get yourself back to tip top shape. Ask for Mike bc he's the bomb. Great atmosphere, take a right, walk to the back and the first spot on the left."}
{"text":"Great food but service leaves a lot to be desired. Been there twice (again food is great). Ladies in charge of dim sun are not very friendly. When you ask someone for a favor (water or change ), you get an attitude. Hard for me to understand how a business that has so much competition can afford to hire staff with attitudes."}
{"text":"A restaurant that has a server pushing a cart around full of dumplings, steam buns, egg rolls, etc?.....I think yes! This place is awesome and while you can order directly off their menu, I prefer sitting and selecting a couple choices right off of the cart and have food right in front of me in less than 3 mins after arriving. The service is good and the servers are on top of passing by every so often, offering you more off the cart. Love their pork dumpling and eggrolls! Great place for a quick bite or appetizers."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch here yesterday. I'm a big dim sum fan and the food here is quite good. I only sampled a few things since the dim sum cart didn't get to the far corner where we were seated very often. I would have had more steamed selections but the cart that came to us had more fried varieties.

That said, we ordered and shared a Vietnamese noodle soup that was delicious. We pretty much filled up on that...but we also sampled the pork bun, steamed shrimp dumplings, chicken egg roll, fried crab and steamed pork. My least favorite was the steamed pork; I really liked the shrimp dumpling and the pork bun. 

I wasn't hungry for the rest of the day yesterday after indulging in all of this deliciousness. Pricing is high for dim sum but it's Vegas and located in the Paris resort....not like going to Chinatown in a big city. Still...very good food and great service."}
{"text":"This place is open late but I feel like my choices were limited. It wasn't busy at all and I was alarmed the food might not be that well here, but I wanted to give it a shot. It smell so good on the walkway, you can see big pots steaming. It's like you are on the busy streets wanting to walk in for well, street food. The food is decent but overpriced. There's dumplings, noodles (taiwanese, chinese, japanese), rice dishes, and also a dim sum cart ranging from $6-$10. I got the roast duck soup, wished there was more broth and that the duck was still pretty tough. They offer a good drink variety such as iced coffee and milk tea also but I just stuck to water.  If you have an appetite to satisfy and I did, it will be expensive. I picked up the bill for my family and even left still hungry.

I enjoy staying here at Paris, so I will keep this place on my list of eats next time around and would probably just stick with their soups and noodles."}
{"text":"I was too lazy to leave the hotel and was craving for Asian food so I decided to try this place since it was convenient.  This place has only been open for a month and it averaged 4 out of 5 stars on Yelp.

The wonton soup was very salty and the shredded chicken with ginger sauce was lacking flavor.  The Dim Sum dishes were average but at $6-$8 per Dim Sum dish, it wasn't worth it.

Overall, come here if you are desperate for Asian food and lazy to travel to Chinatown (which was our case)."}
{"text":"Just opened a few weeks ago. Located inside the Paris hotel. Decor is really cool. We sat down to taste some dim sum - which came to us in a dim sum cart that rolls around the dining area. We had the soup dumplings and hargao. Pretty good. Not sure if it was worth the $7+ each item - but hey it's Vegas! We also had the Taiwanese beef noodle soup. It definitely took me back to Taiwan. Now, of course it's not exactly the same but the flavors were really good. The beef was extremely tender. I would definitely recommend it if you're in the mood for some dumplings or noodles."}
{"text":"Average dim sum and terrible wonton noodles. At 2am, the steamed pork ribs and siew mai are pretty good. Definitely avoid the noodles. I wouldn't eat here in the day but it's a good late night grub spot. 

Service is slow. Some servers are friendly while some are grouchy. It's hit or miss.

I would eat here again at 2am."}
{"text":"I travel to HK and China 3-4 times a year and everytime I go there I try to have wonton noodle soup (in HK ) 
This place has the same ( almost ) taste as HK noodle soup place 
Great noodle soup !"}
