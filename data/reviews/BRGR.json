{"text":"Service was a bit slow.. We waited for a little bit to be seated.. We sit near the open window which was really nice.. Ordered drinks that took a while to get.. Our waitress didnt introduce herself which I can't stand when you have to ask for it.. The food was great though! Burgers were delicious.. Very well seasoned! Inside the restaurant wasn't nothing too special.. The food was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great burgers.  The fries are awesome, nice and crispy. You have to try the milkshakes.  So good."}
{"text":"I love their average joe burger. I like my burger plain and medium - but still very flavorful! I like that it doesn't come drenched in mayo or ketchup - I want to be able to taste my burger! One time they missed the temperature (medium-well to well-done) and I thought it was quite bland... I'm not sure if they missed the seasoning that day or if the temperature made all the difference."}
{"text":"Perhaps I expect too much from an exclusively burger joint, but I was deeply disappointed by my experience.  While Brgr is purely a burger restaurant they had a mere 5 burger options! WTF? And no 'build your own burger option!  The menu was rounded out by such dubious choices as tuna steak, falafel burger, or turkey burger, as well as a slew of salads.  Really? The place is called burger, just stick to one thing!

At any rate, they offer 4 or so burgers, none of which sound nor tasted good.  My 'medium' burger was virtually rare, cold center that was purple and a barely seared outside.  I ate the thing so fast just to get the ordeal over with.  The rest of the table did the same.  It was curious that 3 us ate there and said nothing about the food til we went to a bar afterwards and everyone admitted that they hated it, but wasn't willing to say so at the restaurant to destroy the evening. 

Also for sides, you have to pay $4 or so for fries or onion rings and what not.  Those were all okay, but nothing amazing. And the beer selection was very good, a standard 10 or so beers w/a good mix of local and national micros. 

Overall, I'll never return.  The burgers were subpar and the prices, while not super high, aren't worth such mediocrity.  Sadly, w/fries and a burger you're paying $16-20 for a very average meal.  Add to it the lame atmosphere which includes far too many remnants from the space's former owners.

Stay away!"}
{"text":"Walked out after finding Foie Gras on the menu. Interesting how they make a point to allow vegetarian substitutions for the burgers, but put food created from animal torture on the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here only twice with our families. The first time I got the Average Joe burger with avocado. It was ok, I don't think it had much flavor and it was very dry! I had to add some of the sauces they have there in order to eat it.  Mine was also mostly bun than beef.

Just yesterday I had the Fire In the Hole burger and again it was pretty good but nothing memorable. Even though this one came with guacamole and a chipotle mayo, I still found it a bit dry. 

The fries though are tasty along with the shakes. I would not really come back here though for a burger unless I was invited. It's not bad but it's not great either."}
{"text":"Living nearby, I've been to Brgr several times now.  Unfortunately, my first visit was the best-the others have been pretty average.  During our most recent visit, my husband and I decided it would be our last.  There are just better choices out there.  I'm not going to pay $10 for a burger that only covers a portion of my bun or that is clearly overcooked.  And we're in Pittsburgh here.  Where are the fresh, hand-cut fries?  If I want thin fries that came out of the freezer-I'll stop at McDonalds."}
{"text":"After taking a final, there was nothing more than wanting to gorge myself on a good burger and then take a nap. While the burger I had was good (average joe), the service was lacking. A friend and I were immediately seated but then waited over 10 minutes for someone to even come over, and it was out hostess who sat us telling us our waitress would be coming. Ok, I can understand getting busy but there were several other waitresses standing around talking with each other, it was very awkward.
The redeeming element of BRGR were the chips. My friend and I shared this but we could have each had our and more."}
{"text":"you can get fat here. seriously. between beef, fries and giant sized alcoholic milkshakes.. 

..just change the typeface on the logo.. geezus PAPYRUS FONT IS ONE STOP SHORT OF THE GODAWFUL COMIC SANS  and what a graphic design letdown! 

otherwise the food, is good. the fries are tasty and my kobe beef burger was so perfect, the meat was the grade that i paid for, cooked exactly how i asked, each single bite a perfect dissolution of velvety fat and juice in my mouth.. i even ate the bun it was so good. 

not sure about anything else cos well, didnt have room for much else. I do wish the beer was cheaper.. 4 dollars for a yeuingling is highway robbery in this town - in the summer, with the windows open and the roof patiothis place will be awesome... I liked the 2redlounge that used to be there before, and I hope BRGR is smart enough to take advantage of the rooftop and great stone bar - and offer a alluring happy hour with food compliments, which i do not see as an option yet... 

the decor has not changed significantly since 2redlounge.. but who cares. its burgers =)"}
{"text":"The burgers here are good but huge! I tried the button buster which had just the right combination of sweet and tangy. The burger has braised beef short rib an onion ring and bearnaise aioli. The Flavor combinations just awesome. 

My friend got the salmon burger which was equally delicious. 

If you like burgers and a fun, kind of trendy atmosphere, you should definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I have no complaints, but it's nothing too special. Okay... I'm a vegetarian, so I can't comment on the burgers. But the service has always been quick and friendly here from the servers and bartenders. The shakes are good, but I usually order one of the well-priced craft beers (they have a great selection) or a deconstructed cocktail.

My favourite is probably the deconstructed tequila cocktail - a shot of tequila with a chaser of sangrita (yes!!!) followed with a can of tecate for $7. My boyfriend got the pickle back - a shot of whiskey with a pickle juice chaser followed by a PBR for $6. Nice! I think these are really fun.

The crack dip is good, but the truffle cheese wiz is even way better. That's the dip that brings me back for serious bar snacks. Yum!"}
{"text":"I was here opening week, so hopefully things have improved since then. A very friendly and knowledgable manager was training a less than happy server, so our service was very odd. I was also told I could have mac n cheese made with special sauce, since I'm a vegetarian, and it was not at all as described. The shakes are good, but their strong alcoholic ones are still a little too sweet and sugary for me. I think they should have a stiff option that actually tastes like booze instead of candy. But that's understandable. The cheesy tots are probably my favourite thing on the menu - totally get it instead of fries as an app!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!

Really enjoyed my time at this trendy spot in shadyside!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! OMG the best burger I've ever had in my life! The Moscow Mule was on point too!"}
{"text":"I have to tell you that when I went to BRGR the first time months ago it was a disaster - especially the service.

I had such a bad taste in my mouth that I almost didn't want to go when a group of friends suggested we have dinner there.

BRGR seems to have re-tooled during the time that I was refusing to go, because my last visit was fantastic. The hostesses were awesome, our server (Sam) was spectular, the food and drinks were great - the menu is different.

I won't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"First of all, let me say I rarely eat red meat.  I'm more of a chicken/turkey/seafood kind of gal.  This was my third time to Brgr, and I had previously tried the Salmon Burger (just so-so) and the Tree Hugger (lentil & falafel - not too fulfilling). This time, however, I decided to take the plunge and try an actual BURGER.  So I went with the Shrooms burger, topped with forest mushrooms, caramelized onions, brie cheese and mustard aioli.  I ordered it medium-well, and it was prepared accordingly.

For me, a person who eats red meat only a couple times per year, the burger wasn't mindblowingly, extraordinarily outstanding.  It was tasty, but I wasn't rocked to my core. The mustard aioli was pretty yummy, though...unfortunately, I couldn't really taste the brie.

My friend ordered the Double Yoi Burger, which came with pastrami, Swiss cheese, fried egg, cole slaw, and Thousand Island dressing. He moaned and raved his way through the thing - definitely sounds of pleasure and satisfaction. I was happy because it was his first time to Brgr, and he thoroughly enjoyed it.

We also shared an order of the fries (just with the parmesan and herbs), which were pretty standard (but nicely cooked), and a salty caramel milkshake (delish!). 

So....from a culinary perspective, it was pretty good fare, though I have heard Burgatory blows it out of the water...

As for other factors, my friend and I had a short wait time, and our server was a very personable, patient, attentive 20-something woman who was very pleasant and helpful with our menu questions.  

I would go back to Brgr - it's very convenient to my apartment, and I really want to try the Thai Pork & Shrimp Burger. :)"}

{"text":"I like the vibe and the burgers here.  The took away my favorite beer (a rasberry lambic style), but I can understand that something like that is not to everyone's taste!  The only real complaint that I have is that one of the hostesses needs an attitude adjustment.  I went in a couple weeks ago with a dear friend visiting from out of town and wanted to bring her to BrGr for a quick welcome drink when she arrived.  We arrived around 4pm on a weekday, when the place was virtually empty, and asked to sit on the couches (again, the whole area was empty) and the hostess curtly refused to seat us there on the grounds that we weren't eating.  It is my experience that the best way to handle policies like this is to say to the customer that they are welcome to sit where they would like as long as the place is empty, but that if a large table comes in they will have to move.  After all, we just wanted a quick drink and, based on my experience of the place, would have been out before the rush.  In any case, what was a pretty good opinion of the restaurant was seriously soured by this experience.  The hostess wasn't even apologetic, she was off-putting and generally seemed like her decision was based on power and pride, not care for the customer or the business."}
{"text":"5:30 dinner scheduled in the heart of East Liberty, or is it East Side these days.  My friend Tammy and I started at the bar of BRGR, which was surprisingly quiet for a Thursday happy hour.  However, we soon learned why the inside was quiet.  With several beers on tap, I enjoyed a cold white Belgium beer as she sipped on a glass of red.  We seemlessly closed out our tab and worked over to the hostess.  The plan was to sit on the rooftop deck and soak in the beautiful spring weather, but it was seated to full capacity (around 6 PM).  The next best table was available, a high top along Centre Avenue (great for people watching).  BRGR is a great place for folks with food allergies, as my friend made some special requests that were all met with ease.  We had a duo/team serving us, 1/2 in training.

Tammy did not want the bun, but the trainee confidently offered a lettuce wrap to replace the bun.  She also had an option to choose a healthier side vs. fries (which I ordered) and decided on a vinegar based coleslaw.  Not for everyone, I ended up eating the majority of that slaw, mixed with raisins and carrots.  My Turkey Burger was juicy and heartily topped with avocado, tomato and a sweet dressing.  A great place for candid conversation, the interior of BRGR did not change much from its previous occupant, 2Red.  Since its inception in the Pittsburgh market, BRGR has expanded to the North (Wexford), South (The Gallera Mall - Opening TBD) and PNC Park.  There is a food truck option for catering and festivals.  With higher end burger joints serving as a huge foodie trend, the price for drinks and food was a bit pricey.  That would be my only constructive comment about the experience.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times, and each time is a delight!  I love the beer selection and spiked milkshakes.  Terrific!
Food quality is a 4-star.  Options for vegetarians and pescatarians aren't all that great, but hey, its a \"Brgr\" joint!
Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"They have pretty good burgers and awesome happy hour deals. My BF frequently come here on fridays to wind down after a long week. 
That being said, it sucks to get hurried out of an establishment because \"we have a large party waiting to sit\". Last time I checked they do not take reservations and the manager flat out lied to our small group of 5. This being the first time being \"kicked out\" of a restaurant EVER! was new and leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Kind of hard to recommend such an establishment that lacks customer service 101. Common courtesy goes a long way."}
{"text":"Family and I had dinner here and between the 4 of us we got the Maui Wowie (very good), Average Joe (exactly as the name suggests, meh), Shrooms burger (typical burger with mushrooms), and the BRGR (their namesake, too similar to the Shrooms-a burger with mushrooms). All in all, the food was good tasting and flavorful. Unfortunately their service was pretty bad. We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table when within our sight there were 3 available 4-person tables. When we asked about it we were told they liked to save those tables in case larger parties came in and need to be seated. We were appalled and almost left. We had to wait so they could accommodate people that may or may not show up after us to get seated BEFORE us. Our server was very unfriendly and not at all interested in answering our questions. The Average Joe burger was completely different from how we ordered it. And we had to ask to have our water filled from the hostess because we asked our server three times for more water and she just kept forgetting and going to talk with her coworkers. Would've given this review one star but the food was actually good although I probably won't go back until they've turned over the staff."}
{"text":"The good.

The hostess had me seated pretty quickly despite the place being crowded and our waiter was very attentive.  Good job.  Nice atmosphere and decor.  The light and sunny \"beertail\" was pretty tasty and would recommend it if you like wheat beers.

The bad.  

Sadly BRGR's biggest failure was what it has centered its name and menu on.  Both my date and myself ordered a \"Fire in the Hole\" burger.  Despite coming with jalapenos (jarred), chipotle mayo and sriracha, it didn't even register on the heat scale with me or my date.  We both just found it to be kinda bland.

The burger itself was also tiny for what I would have imagined from a place called BRGR.  The beef patty was probably only 4 ounces or so, which I'm sorry, but for a $9 burger that doesn't even include fries (Yes you read that right, french fries are $4 extra).  The only positive thing to say about the burger was that it was correctly cooked as ordered.

I will gladly pay for small portions of good food, or even big portions of okay food, but they fail to deliver either.  There are several places in Pittsburgh which can offer both a tastier and bigger burger, for cheaper (Fat Head's, Burgatory come to mind)."}
{"text":"Better burger options in the burgh.

-The hostess told us there was going to be a 15 minute wait (there were at least 3 visible empty tables in the main area). She ended up having to track us down in the mall seating area after a half hour because \"something went wrong with their texting system\". 

- Our waitress came by shortly after we were seated and took our drink order. My wife got a diet and I order a coke. We both received diet. Not a huge deal for me but I could tell the mostly high school student staff wasn't experienced. 

-Ordered the grilled cheese bites appetizer, it was literally a grilled cheese sandwich cut in fourths. Not even an overly good sandwich at that. 

-My wife ordered a \"make your own burger.\" the waitress asked no questions (such as how she would like her burger cooked) nor did she repeat her order to make sure it was correct. Her burger was marked as being cooking medium well but it was extremely dry. 

-The only issue I had with my meal were the Cajun tater tots. They were just frozen tots with a heavy dusting of Cajun powder on them. 

-Overall, for a lunch that was pretty costly I was disappointed. If you are looking for a good burger in Pittsburgh, try out Burgatory or Wingharts before this place."}
{"text":"Food Was good but the service not the best. Super slow. The server came to the table twice, to make the order and to bring the check."}
{"text":"Simply delicious! And the decor is comfortable and rugged. The milkshakes are \"adult\" and amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, good service, and quick food to table. What more can you ask for? On top of that, they have creative burgers. The only burger joint I love more is Burgatory. I also suggest sitting on the balcony overlooking East Liberty."}
{"text":"BRGR is a my boyfriend and I's go-to spot in Shadyside when we feel like getting something better than Whole Food's hot bar, but don't feel like going too crazy on a meal at Spoon, Casbah, or Salt.  It has a casual, relaxed atmosphere, with plenty of TVs for sports action and big garage doors to let in the natural light.  In the late spring and summer, they open up the rooftop seating area.  It's a great place to grab a bite to eat or a drink while being outside and enjoying the warm weather.

We have dined here several times in the past few months and always order the same thing: a california turkey burger and a salad (the current seasonal salad, pickled beet, is delicious).  We order just one of each, and ask that they split the order up for us.  This means they bring out two bowls of salad and two baskets each with half a burger and pickle.  The half salad/half burger is a pretty decent portion and comes in at under $20 for two people...not bad for Shadyside. 

Be warned, the parking situation at BRGR is a little sketchy.  You can either take your chances and hope you don't get towed by parking across the street, pray for a street parking spot, or cough up $3 for the valet parking.

Also, be aware that some of the menu items change seasonally.  On one occasion, we ordered our standard turkey burger+salad combo...without realizing that the turkey burger had taken on a \"Thanksgiving\" style preparation complete with cranberry, stuffing, and green beans.  Although I enjoy these side dishes as part of my family Thanksgiving dinner, I didn't like the taste of these piled onto a turkey burger and a bun.  Luckily, they've since switched it back to the much tastier cali-style burger."}
{"text":"I have been to BRGR twice, both times in a desperate attempt to find a michelada before 5pm on a Saturday. (Disclaimer: I haven't had the food here, just drinks.) The parties I went with may not be the restaurant's average clientele, but that doesn't excuse the fact that both times it took us seven to nine minutes to find a hostess to seat us, nor the fact that when we did hunt one down, she more or less sneered at us.  (The service issue persists through the entire meal--the most recent time I was there, my table waited for 20 minutes for our check after our table had been cleared, while our waitress chatted with a co-worker behind the upstairs bar).

Most disappointing michelada ever, and I (for some reason) once had one with Braggs and Thai basil at Cantina. The fact that my friend comes here on the regular specifically for beer cocktails baffles me; I seek out a michelada, as with most spicy, tomatoey cocktails, to make myself a little more human after having a few too many the night before. That BRGR managed to craft a hangover drink that tastes exactly like vomit seems to be missing the point. Truly undrinkable, and I never abandon a cocktail.

The second time I had learned my lesson, and opted for the Little Blood deconstructed cocktail. This, I was into. I'm not much of a shots person, so I alternated between sips of tequila (Espolon, my personal mid-shelf favorite) and the thick, sweet, and slightly spicy sangrita served with it. The cold can of Tecate was refreshing, and let me linger over my drink the way I want to on a Saturday afternoon, without forcing me to make a shot last for twenty minutes. It could have used a lime, but not so badly that I thought to ask for one.

Next time my friends and I need an early afternoon drink, I'm headed to the Thunderbird. But I'll admit that I'm curious to try their other deconstructed cocktails, so I may return someday. But I'll know to dress up, and give myself a lot of time."}
{"text":"It's not as good as I hoped it could be. It's a burger in a mall in the suburbs.  No flavor to the meat, fries are frozen from a bag, bun is nothing special, bacon was over cooked or reheated.  On a positive note the staff was very good."}
{"text":"Visited this place a few weeks ago and ordered the signature burger. I asked for well done and I got med rare/rare. I ate it anyway. It was really good. Got home and was sick for 3+ hours. Huge disappointment because I really liked the burger. Seems like they have kids working there..."}
{"text":"I enjoy BRGR. My favorite thing to get there is a spiked milkshake. It has been a while since I ate a burger there, but I think I enjoyed it. The deep fried pickles appetizer tastes just like Chick Fil A chicken. 
They are creative with their drinks and I enjoy them all.
Sometimes it gets filled with too many hipsters and the whole bar is circled with people drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon. 
I like BRGR more than Burgatory. Although, that could be because BRGR has a better location - Burgatory is further out of the way and I have only been there once."}
{"text":"Great spot. Those salmon burgers are my go-to. The shakes with alcohol are so thick that I think its nearly suicidal if you try to knock an entire one out on your own."}
{"text":"Crappy, overpriced burger and poor service. Had to go Wendy's right after to get the taste of an actual burger. NOT Recommended. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"This is place is amazing!! I had my aunt run here for quick dinner. My aunt and uncle got a cabbage wrap and I got the Fire in the Hole Burger with Cajun Fries  It was sooooo good! I don't live in Pittsburgh but when I come back, this is one of the places I would def come back too :)"}
{"text":"Booze milkshakes and burger sliders... can it get any better?  Let me answer that for you, NO WAY! For the past year and a half I have visited Pittsburgh over a dozen times spending from 3 days at time to spending entires week so I would like to think I have eaten my way though Pittsburgh and the only place I have been back 5 times or more has been HERE! 

It is a fun and young atmosphere with an outstanding menu and cocktail list... Come very hungry and leave buzzed and full! 

I promise you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"We love this place!  Menu has something for everyone in our family. Service is usually very good although food sometimes takes a bit long. Food is excellent- never had a bad meal here. 

Cool design and great location in Galleria. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Gave brgr a 2nd chance tonight after movie with husband.  The experience was as bad as the first. Rude servers !Horrible seating system.  
Save your cash and go anywhere else. 
We won't bother with a 3rd chance."}
{"text":"The appetizers were good.   I am not sure what DJ is talking about. This place is a poor knock off of Burgatory.   The burger options are limited and I agree with a previous poster,  somewhat flavorless.   If you want a great burger go to Burgatory. In a pinch this place will do for appetizers. 

The other thing that was lacking was service.   We actually had to go get our server to get our iced teas refilled, even though she checked on the table next us every five minutes. She never once checked on us until we went and asked her for refills."}
{"text":"Honest question: does BRGR even want my patronage?

Or your patronage? Or anyone's, for that matter? Seriously, what will it take for this overpriced and overhyped rehash of a burger concept to actually, I don't know, invest in some basic training on how to run a restaurant--starting with Hospitality 101? Do they actively not want to make money, or are they just that bad of a restaurant?

Three times I've been to BRGR, at three different times of day, with three different sets of people. Each time, I've been underwhelmed by the food, and truly astonished by how poor the service is. The hostesses are downright rude. The servers--and calling them that is generous--seem to resent speaking to customers or delivering food or doing anything remotely related to their jobs. The bartender was cold and condescending when we ordered beers...which we had to approach her for, since she was ignoring us. The only thing the employees of this restaurant seem to be good at is wearing inappropriately short shorts and chatting among each other as they congregate near the bar. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed trying to flag down our waitress as we attempted to order another drink...as she leaned on the bar with her back to us. I know I've been out of the industry for a few years, but I'm pretty sure that \"if you have time to lean, you have time to clean\" still applies.

The food is overpriced, entirely uncreative, and executed poorly. I asked for a burger medium rare...which arrived extremely rare and very greasy. My SO's medium burger was a well-done, and also very greasy. We also accidentally received someone else's (presumably greasy) burger which sat on our table, getting cold, for five minutes before we were able to get the attention of the waiter who had wordlessly placed it on our table and then wordlessly retrieved it--seriously, do the managers beat them if they smile at or speak to customers? It's also downright cheap that the burgers come with nothing--that you have to order fries, etc, on the side. I once ordered the fried pickles as an appetizer, which were soggy and bland. People rave about the adult milkshakes, which are decent enough but nothing that I haven't had at, say, Red Robin before. The fries are fine if you like salt and Costco-brand shredded Parmesan.

As if the awful service and mediocre food wasn't enough, the concept and flow of this place don't even make any sense. Each time, I have been rushed through my meal--even when the restaurant has been almost empty, as it was one early Saturday evening last week. The decor is bland, except for the too-numerous televisions, which are not generally the hallmark of a gourmet experience. To top it all off, both drinks and food are overpriced--you'll pay more here for a beer than anywhere else, and for no apparent reason, because their selection is decidedly \"meh.\"

Bottom line: I would rather dine at the Petsmart across the street than experience the complete failure of a restaurant experience that is BRGR again."}
{"text":"Our server was really sweet and super knowledgable about the menu. I had the King Salmon burger, to try something different, and I enjoyed it! I'd probably stick to a normal patty next time, because that's what I'm used to. The truffle fries were addictive and I couldn't get enough of The Dude spiked shake!! Like most alcoholics shakes, it only had a hint of vodka, just so you could know it was slightly there, don't expect to feel anything from it except joy. But as a shake on its own, it was great!"}
{"text":"This place is always crowded, which is a good sign. The burgers are big. The milkshakes delicious. They do their best to accommodate food issues - like gluten free (ie - wrap it in lettuce) and veggie options. The veggie burger I had was really dry, though.

All in all, it's a good place to go with guys who generally really like the burgers. The atmosphere isn't quite my style.

Valet parking was quick and affordable ($3)."}
{"text":"Went for lunch while in the area on business. We were a party of three and it took 50 minutes for our food to arrive. I had the Cease and Desist burger- it was ok. Buns are great, burger was juicy, but flavor was just ok. Cajun tater tots with ranch sauce were the best part of my meal."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. I usually take friends here whenever they visit. Their burger selection has something for everyone. I find their veggie burgers incredible. I've had a table on the patio probably 5 out of the 6 times I've been there and the wait has never been very long."}
{"text":"My first experience at BRGR was great. The atmosphere was chill. I had a lot of space , it nice and quiet and most importantly the food was perfect. It was served fast and it was fresh off the grill."}
{"text":"You won't regret making your own juicy burger! They have unique toppings that will make your mouth water! For example: pieorgies, cheese sticks, chicken fingers and such!"}
{"text":"Got the turkey burger and it was yummy. My friends said their burgers were cooked more than they wanted though. Still, food was good. Our server didn't check back often but I know typically they are more attentive because I've been to this location a few times"}
{"text":"Food: *Disclaimer: all food comments come from a vegetarian perspective* 
BRGR serves exactly what you would expect, burgers.  And thats pretty much it.  They have two salad options, neither of which look exciting, a few sides like chili, and french fries.  There are 10+ burger options, all of which can be made with veggie burgers, and 2-3 hot dog options, which can't be made veggie friendly.  The burgers range from sweet (carmelized onions), to spicy (jalapenos), to mexican (guac), to BBQ style (apple wood bacon), and more.  The veggie burger is huge and comprised of mostly falafel with some corn sprinkled in, but lacks flavor.  Other restaurants in the city make homemade veggie burgers, and this one doesn't rate in the top 10, or even close.  The descriptions of the burgers sound considerably better than they actually taste; nothing has blown us away in multiple visits trying multiple items.  Even the unusual condiments on every table are skimpy on flavor.  The fries are enough to share, and are above average but not spectacular.  Wheat buns and gluten-free options are available.  The non-veggie burgers include beef, turkey, and even seafood.  Carnivorous friends have been satisfied, but not amazed.

Price: Burgers range from $7-12 and sides from $3-6.  The burgers are very big, so you'll definitely get your fill.  The fries are meant for a group, so at $4, you get a pretty decent amount.  Cocktails range from $6-10, but are worthwhile (see below).  There are late night specials that include burgers and Pabst Blue Ribbon, which is definitely a plus. 

Drinks: You would think hamburgers would be what a place named BRGR does best, but, if you thought that, you would be wrong.  BRGR's bar is fantastic, with a large and diverse beer selection, unique cocktails and liquor choices, and bartenders who know how to make the drinks well.  There aren't many restaurants in Pittsburgh I would say this about, but it is worth going to BRGR just to drink.  The cocktails aren't cheap, but they're large, interesting, and stiff.  There are seasonal specials, and BRGR also offers spiked milkshakes, all of which sound incredible.

Atmosphere: The downstairs and upstairs rooms at BRGR both have great atmosphere, a true strength of the East Liberty location.  Downstairs, there is a garage door in the front which opens to the the sidewalk and street and allows sunlight and fresh air in.  The bar is big and is a good place to hang out until your table is ready.  Upstairs is even better.  In front, you can look out over Centre. Ave., and from behind, you have a beautiful view of gothic East Liberty architecture, which looks beautiful as the sun sets.  

Service: The service has always been attentive, helpful, and friendly over the course of multiple visits to BRGR.  The bartenders know what they're doing and are more than willing to carry on a conversation if you're alone.  BRGR provides Valet parking at a $3 charge plus gratuity, which may be necessary on a Friday night.  

(+): great drinks, solid service, and truly nice atmosphere

(-): overall, the food is average at best

Would I go back again? For drinks, absolutely, and after 5-6 of them, I may be convinced to try another burger."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I enjoy going to BRGR for date nights or just when we are simply too lazy to cook and it never disappoints. The California burger (made of turkey) is super filling and flavorful but what we both LOVE are the mini grilled cheese bites as an appetizer - they're delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly service by Gregory.  First, the hostess allowed us to choose where we wanted to sit: upstairs balcony, patio, or in the dining area.  We were going to share a brgr, fries and chocolate malt.  It was brought out to us fast and already split.  It's a good thing because the portions were large.  There were whole and half malted milk balls in the malt, too!  So glad we went!"}
{"text":"I have been to brgr many times over the last few years always seeking out local real food. I went out of my way on Sunday,as I was in between things  I was alone. It was A comedy of errors from beginning to end. the worst service I think I have ever gotten anywhere.  I sat for 10 minutes before the waitress came and brought me water. QI had to ask for her to take my order. When my meal came somebody else brought it it was the wrong order and over cooked.  After several minutes of sitting alone with it I began to eat the part I was not allergic to   after a timethe waitress came to check on me (mid bite). I alerted her to the situation but as I was needing a quick bite to get onto the next thing I decided not to send it back but asked for A plate to separate the food I could eat out    the plate never came   I ended up taking it home for my dog-   another 10 minutes sitting with my forks forks down before she came by and I could ask her for a to go box. (Biodegradable). Then had to ask her 10 minutes later for my check.   I am lucky to live in Pittsburgh that gives me the option of finding real local food elsewhere"}
{"text":"Overall this place was excellent. The atmosphere was somehow classy and casual with bar seating, couches and lounge areas and tables. We thoroughly enjoyed the rueben eggrolls for an appetizer but were disappointed that the fried pickles were in spear form instead of chips style. The BRGR burger was deliciously juicy but the highlight was the Big Easy shrimp burger. It was AMAZING. The Cajun tater tots were well seasoned and came with ranch dipping sauce. We finished the meal with a boozy cookies and cream milkshake that perfectly rounded out the meal. My husband and I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm a little confused by the goal of BRGR - is it a place to hang out and eat a good burger and drink some nice beers, as suggested by the multiple TVs with sporting events?  Or is it more of a high turnover joint, wham bam, thank you ma'am, as the service would indicate?

The burgers are good, around $10-12 for each; no sides, which are extra - $3 for the chips w/cheese sauce, and $4+ for the fries.  The Kobe burger I thought was a bit disappointing, and maybe the extra $12 would have made it better - but I thought the flavor fell flat.  The Button Burger, which also has short ribs and onion rings was very, very tasty.  It was a shame I had to share half of it with my wife.

And there is a nice selection of microbrews to choose from.

So I was hoping for a nice night of a big, juicy burger, and drinking some beers -- but essentially, we got a fast-food type of waiter -- who was taking food off of our table, even though we were still grazing on the chips and fries -- and dropping off the check without asking if there was anything else, which in fact, would have been another round of beers.  

I'm sure if I had a better experience, one which lasted longer than a Kardashian marriage, I'm sure I would come back.  And if you haven't been here, I still think it's worth trying.  But in the future, when I want fast-food service, I'd rather just drop the $5 for a 5 Guys Burger -- at least eating there is like having a friend with benefits... no expectations.  Oh well, I guess Burgatory is next!"}
{"text":"Fabulous delicious burger.  Fresh ground meat, great bun and cooked to perfection"}
{"text":"Good burgers, but not great. When a restaurant wants to be known as a higher class burger joint, the burgers better be great, which unfortunately they were not. I had the Button Buster which was a burger with short rib meat on top. I ordered it medium, and it came out a little overcooked, not bad enough that I would send it back. The burger was a bit dry and the sauce overpowered the aftertaste. Again, if you are strictly a burger joint the burgers should be prepared perfectly every time. The fries were excellent with a little cheese and spice on a standard order. The menu offered enough of a selection to meet everyone's needs. 

The atmosphere is great. Great beer selection and a knowledgeable bar staff. Great place to hang out with a few friends. 

I would go back to try another burger on the menu. If I got this burger in a standard restaurant I would have been more than happy. But in a specialty burger joint I have higher expectations which BRGR did not live up to."}
{"text":"Had a problem with the manager Carolyn (sp?). We had a party of 11 with a death in the family. Since we had a lot of people I understand it can be hard work for a waiter. Our waiter was pleasant and did a good job, but Carolyn walked by several times rolling her eyes and shaking her head after we asked for some extra side plates. We then had a problem with the bill and instead of handling like a \"manager\" she continued saying things under her breath and rolling her eyes. I asked our waiter for her name. Apparently our waiter told her that I did so because at the end of the meal she confronted me, which I thought was also inappropriate. I told her the reason I had an issue was because of her attitude and she denied doing all of these things. When I gave her examples, she said \"well the transaction was really hard\" I said that's no excuse for your attitude and two of the ladies at the table had a \"hard\" day lost their mother and I think they made it through the meal with more grace than you."}
{"text":"I've been twice now and have not had a good experience either time. First I tried the Kobe beef burger ($12) and was disappointed. The toppings were flavorful and good, but the burger itself was more medium well than the medium rare that I ordered. And then when I finished I realized I had paid $12 on a singular mediocre burger. This was over a year ago so I can't be more specific

Just today, I tried the \"Shrooms\" burger and found it utterly disgusting. In theory, all of the ingredients (brie, mustard, sauted mushrooms, and caramelized onions) are delicious. In execution, they sucked. First, my burger was dripping with oil. This was not the natural result of a nice fatty mix of ground beef but was (presumably) due to the mushrooms being sauted in copious amounts of oil. This resulted in me consuming a great deal of what I assume was canola oil considering it's lack of taste. They also used what tasted like an ultra-pasteurized creamy brie in lieu of the type of brie I prefer and call \"stinky brie.\" The mild flavor of this brie was lost in the burger and it's primary impact was imparting it's somewhat mushy texture. This would not have been a problem if the too-large bun wasn't soaked in grease, wrapped around a burger with no crust, or topped with sauted mushrooms and caramelized onions which both provided the contrasting moutfeel of... soft vegetables. I don't know if the burger was ill-executed or ill-conceived but it lacks flavor and there is absolutely zero crunch to this burger. Each mouthful was just a somewhat bland pile of mush that left a grease trail around my mouth. 

Using raw red onion and blue cheese instead would probably help the flavor and texture, but the lack of char on the bun and patty is inexcusable. The mustard was the shining star in the flavor category but do you really want the best thing you can say about a burger to be, \"Well the mustard was good?\""}
{"text":"Great burgers, but the service is very slow.  We waited 15 to place our order, 20min for our burgers. Then after we ate we waited another 15 to get the bill."}

{"text":"Good burgers, with unique toppings, but shakes lack in flavor! Brgr is good but if you want a better burger, go to burgatory!"}
{"text":"Another occasion where 3 1/2 stars would be perfect!

BRGR has upped their game in the last 6-9 months, and after another visit or two, I might even bump this up to 4 stars. Their tater tots are the best in the city, and some ofd the best I've ever had. I am a big fan of their turkey burger, and I feel like all of their burgers have been a little better lately. Plus they have a good vegetarian burger that can easily be made vegan, and they're sensitive to those needs to.

Cons: the atmosphere is a little too loud and unfocused. I think a place like Burgatory does a better job of balancing the casualness of the burger restaurant with the higher prices. And BRGR's beer selection is a little boring sometimes, and cocktails can be hit or miss. But overall, it's a great option, and I'm glad to see it's gotten better in recent months. Those tots, man...they're really terrific."}
{"text":"Burgers were awesome! I actually tried the California Lovin' turkey burger on lettuce wrap (never had a burger on a lettuce wrap before) and it was delicious! My co-workers tried two other burgers as well and loved them! We will definitely be returning. Besides...I want to try the Spiked Handspun Milkshakes :)"}
{"text":"I had a hard time rating this place.

So much was a clear 5 about it; the atmosphere, the roof top patio, the boozey shakes and floats. It was all good!

What fell flat for me, was the burger itself, which is a shame when your place is called Brgr. First the good on the burger; the buns are amazing, toasted to perfection, and the ingredients are clearly fresh. What fell flat then? I mid-rare burger without a trace a pink, and lack of creativity, and more importantly texture and zip in the toppings.

I will indeed be back for their post 10pm specials which include a cheap average Joe burger and deals on their wonderfully creative ice-cream and liquor cocktails. I also want to try the lamb burger. I will update my review after another visit."}
{"text":"I am new to Pittsburgh and some suggested I stop by this restaurant. I had never been to Shadyside before (which is a cool place!) and from my first impression I liked it! It's a cool place with a young staff and great decor. They had multiple seating options (maybe because I was there on a slow night?) but we got a great seat by the window. 

I had a burger and a spiked shake - can it get any better than a shake and alcohol?! The burger was great - much more than I could eat in one sitting. The fries were tasty as well. 

My waitress was kind and the host even chatted for a while about things to do in Pittsburgh. I'll def be back when I'm in the area again and would love to bring friends!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to here and this time I was a bit disappointed. I tried the Kobe Beef burger today and found it wasn't very hot. I'm fine with its medium rare-ness, but I think a burger should be a warm, not room temp. The bun was soggy due to the juice from the pickle spear served along side the burger. But the fries and chips were tasty. The \"adult\" root beer float I had was fine for what it was, but I probably wouldn't get it again. Overall, I wasn't really impressed with the burgers or the drinks. But the upstairs outdoor seating is great on a nice evening. The staff were very accommodating of our large group (14). Initially they said it would be a 45 min wait, but after 10 minutes, our table was ready."}
{"text":"The service was prompt, polite, and friendly.  The food was fantastic.  The salad was so good I did not even notice I did not poor the dressing on.  Serving sizes are good. 

There are gluten free buns and lettuce rap options for the gluten free.  The spicy chicken (can't remember the name) salad was amazing.  The side are huge so you only need one or two for 5 people. 

On draw back I can say is we had to wait a long time for a table while tables sat empty.  The same tables where empty when we left.  There might be a good reason but it is just weird.  We used no wait and signed in with the host immediately."}
{"text":"Very helpful, kind staff.  Love the decor and we enjoyed sitting in a big booth with our kids.  For these two reason I gave two stars.

Unfortunately we came here for the burgers and these were some of the worst I've ever had.  Ordered the tater tots, average joe and the spicy burger (with sriracha sauce and jalapeños).  Both burgers had underwhelming flavor (yes even the \"spicy\" burger) and meat was chewy and not tasty.  Brioche buns were ok, not too bready.

Ordered a side salad that was presented as fresh romaine and seasonal vegetables with egg and bacon bits.  What arrived was a withered bowl of iceberg with chunks of bleu cheese and soggy tomatoes.  Yes I know it's a burger place but don't advertise your salads as something they're not.  

Totally average or below average burger spot in my opinion.  And for these prices and all the hype I was expecting much better."}
{"text":"Insane...having difficulty coming up with another word after having tried the Bison Burger, tater tots, and a spiked dark chocolate milkshake...a must try"}
{"text":"Very disappointed dry meat way too salty really expensive for the food quality pls go to burgatory this place sucks don't waste your money"}
{"text":"my date and I both had a very uninspiring buffalo burger and fries. won't be back for the food but my come back for a shake based on other reviews. 
it was interesting to watch the other customers flag down the waitstaff for service. we eventually had to do the same thing. it wasn't busy but our waitress simply couldn't be bothered."}
{"text":"It was okay. That's the best I can say.  We ordered the fried pickles, which anywhere else is sliced into small pieces and fried, but here they serve in spears.  The problem with that is that the crust fell off almost immediately and you are left with just a warm pickle.  When the burgers came out, they looked delightful, but they were just kind of okay.  The bun looked a lot better than it was.  Fries okay.  Milkshake okay, I ordered the salted caramel (alcoholic) and it tasted like alcohol, which I don't personally consider a good thing."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best burger places around! My boyfriend always enjoys whatever burger he gets and I love their veggie falafel burger. The salads are great too and you get a good sized portion. I love sitting at the bar and the bartenders have always been extremely helpful. It also doesn't hurt that their draft list is great!"}
{"text":"I really like the concept of Brgr and the menu sounds great on paper.  But Brgr is sort of like the new age pizza joint that is everywhere.  The toppings and menu are fantastic and the decor is nice, but they gloss over the most important thing: the basic foundation.

I ordered the \"Button Buster\" which is a burger topped with braised short ribs, white cheddar cheese, bearnaise, and \"crispy onions.\"  The crispy onions turned out to be house-made onion rings which was a pleasant surprise!  That's about the only good thing I can say about this burger.  The braised short ribs were rather tough and not flavorful at all.  The bread at this place is definitely not house-made, which is surprising considering that it's an up-scale burger joint, and is bad and dry.

The worst part?  The burger itself.  Three of us ordered med-rare burgers and ALL of them were WELL DONE.  I mean, c'mon, even Red Robin and Denny's can do better than that.  Could it have been a misplaced order?  Not likely considering the wooden toothpick skewering my dry, dry burger said \"MED RARE.\"  After my first bite, I lifted the bun so I could cut into the burger to check the center.  To my surprise, it looked like the cook had already done that, confirmed that it was to his/her liking, and still served it to us overcooked.

We also tried the spiked shakes which were quite tasty but that's a given with Dave and Andy's.  I wish there had been more milkshake like at a diner where a typical milkshake is really 3x the volume necessary.

I'm not sure if our burgers were a fluke as the restaurant was pretty busy for a Sunday evening.  So I'd suggest going to Brgr at a really off-hour, like maybe 3pm on a weekday, so that you have the kitchen's entire attention.  Or if you prefer well-done burgers, then this place may be okay for you."}
{"text":"How can one argue with a delicious milkshake?  That's the highlight here although there is no shortage of other artery-clogging delights (such as a burger topped with more meat.)  French fries with parmesan and truffle oil or the cajun tater tots are also delightful.  
Don't be afraid to order their salads - beet salad with homemade Boursin cheese was a welcome relief from all the meat."}
{"text":"The food was ok, i had the average joe burger and the wife had the button buster.  Both were cooked just as we asked and were pretty cheap for an entre.  We also split a side of fries.  Also they gave us samples of the milkshakes (ill tell you why in a bit) and they were tasty.  The food was good, nothing outstanding, but solid bar food.  You want a burger, they have burgers.

However, the wait staff was as bad, rude, inattentive and will prevent me from returning.  We had a group, called ahead, the day before and the day of, several times.  We arrived was told it was going to be a bit, so we all got a couple drinks and waited..and waited.. and waited.  ended up getting tables that were not together and not enough seats for our group.  i know things get busy, but we were treated very rudely and told to \"make do with the seats we have\" and many more snippy, impolite comments.  Even waiters were bumping into me while i was waiting for a table and giving me attitude (\"you have to get out of my way\").  The wait and the tables being apart could be forgive, the way we were treated, not forgiven. We were spending a lot of money, lots of drinks, food, etc.  I hate to give a poor review, but honestly this was the rudest i have ever been treated at a restaurant.  I will not be back to BRGR."}
{"text":"Friendly service and consistent quality. I only ever get the turkey burger which is better than most. The fries are great and so is the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just a chill kick back kinda place!!! Employees are fun and outgoing!! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"After reading lots of mixed reviews, I am here to offer yet another mixed review! I really enjoyed the atmosphere, we were seated on the first floor at a table in front of the large garage doors that open out onto the street. Had we not been seated here, the other dining spaces looked cramped and very, very close to guests at the bar. Our server was friendly and efficient, but the hostess was not. We walked in with our (almost) 3 year old and your could immediately tell she was disgusted...even heard her mumble to another employee about why you would bring a child to a bar? Meanwhile, there were at least 2 other toddlers in the restaurant at the time AND and infant in a carseat/carrier on one of the sofas! Also keep in mind this was a Thursday evening at 6 pm, not Saturday night at midnight! And did I also mention that BRGR HAS a separate kids-only menu! Prior to actually dining at BRGR, I had no idea it was being billed as a BAR, rather I thought it was a burger restaurant with a full service bar. Management might want to check into how they want the employees branding their business. 

Other than that the food was okay, not bad, but not anything that has me in a real hurry to go back. Burgers were large enough but did not come with any sides -- fries, orings, etc -- were all ala carte. I like that they were happy to accommodate my special requests in modifying one of their signature burgers, but feel like there should be a few more options on the menu. In theory the Spiked Milkshakes would be good, but they were seriously over the top sugary. I will definitely return to BRGR at some point, just probably not on a regular basis."}
{"text":"The staff behind the bar were all very friendly but I was a bit disappointed by the food.  I had the button buster, which for its name was undersized (the bun was considerably larger than the burger) and overcooked (a cardinal sin for a place that is all about it's burgers and that has a temperature guide expressly printed in its menu). Overall, it mostly satisfied my need for a beer and a burger but for a burger-centric restaurant, I expected a better than average experience."}
{"text":"Nothing much to brag about at BRGR.  Stopped there on a Sunday afternoon with the family.  the food was okay.  It didn't really doesn't differentiate itself from other local gourmet burger chains like Burgatory.  The roll that was used appeared to be fresh baked and quite soft but unnecessarily greasy.  Burgers are greasy enough.  I don't think it's necessary to wipe the top of the bun down with grease just so it appears shiny.  Prices are on par with Burgatory but your burger includes no side.  Not even chips.  I really hate this trend of charging $10 for a sandwich and then charging $4 for fries, $5 for onion rings, or even more for a side salad.  At least Burgatory includes chips with their food.  I don't see this as a place I'd go to again.  There are better options for burgers in the 'Burgh."}
{"text":"Normally a good spot. 1st meal, not ours. 2nd meal, my burger ordered medium was well done (pushing dry). No biggie, just asked for a re*cook. Super snappy fix, except, it wasn't a fix. Just another leathery sack of garbage, which took another 20 min to correct. Thanks for not charging me for the burger I guess?? A comped check would be more appropriate.

Downhill and lack luster at best.

Thankfully I could grab Thai cuisine on the way home so I wasn't super hangry after our date."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere...  Good drafts on tap! Burger was awesome, and they have some interesting creations. Prices were decent for a burger... But it was just that...... A burger....  No sides, they were extra.  Would definitely go back! Good eats!"}
{"text":"Ladies, let's be honest - when it's \"that\" time of the month I am always craving a good, juicy cheeseburger - and BRGR knocks it out of the park every time. I've gone to this location several times and the burger has always been superb. IMHO - they're WAAAAY better than Burgatory (which I find spotty in their consistency). At this location, I always go for the standard \"BRGR\" and I *always* leave super satisfied. YuM!"}
{"text":"Was really hoping that this place would be on par with Butgatory, but the burger I had was really bland. In fact it reminds me why I generally don't order burgers. The fries were mediocre (dry, somewhat stale and equally flavorless). The waitstaff was unimpressive, as well. The only positive was that there's a decent selection of beers on draft. 

In addition, the atmosphere was pretty weak. The chairs were uncomfortable and people are somewhat crammed into the restaurant. 

Very disappointed. Was really hoping to see a restaurant come in into that space that would last, but I wouldn't be surprised if they're closed within a year based on my experience."}
{"text":"We've waited for soooo long for you to open so please live up to your fabulous reputation. Opening night was great!"}
{"text":"Honestly, it was a hamburger. Just a hamburger. The onion rings were cold by the time they got to the table. (To be fair it was jam packed busy, but still.)

Beer selection on tap was weak by local standards. Decor was sort of faux industrial arty, with Restoration-Hardware-style details and canned \"art photos\". They also do the scammy valet parking thing wherein the prime spots in front of the restaurant are out of commission so they can charge for parking. I hate that.

We are in this neighborhood often but would not be tempted to return."}
{"text":"First time at BRGR.  Expected better.  Menu seemed confusing.  Burgers were ok but too rare for us.  We ordered medium-rare; should have asked for medium.  French fries were just ok.  Service was good.  Better gourmet burgers at any number of other area restaurants."}
{"text":"We went here on a Sunday afternoon and were pleased to be seated with no wait.  The layout of the restaurant seems odd in that I felt kind of exposed at the table.

We ordered the fried pickle appetizer.  This was an odd recipe consisting of pickle strips in what is basically unseasoned batter like you would find in fish and chips.  The flavorless batter is far too heavy for an appetizer and doesn't go well with pickles.  They need to change the recipe.  I have never seen fried pickles done this way but am always up for something new.  However, this didn't work.

My burger, ordered medium, with bacon and bleu cheese wasn't very good.  It was dry and tasted like it had sat for a while.  It was barely warm.  The lettuce and tomato were very bland.  The brioche bun was the only positive.  My lady did not like her turkey burger and said it had no taste.  The bun was very cold on her burger. 

Worst of all were the fries with parmesan cheese, herbs, and salt.  Parmesan cheese is a very salty cheese and this combined with the salt on the fries simply made for too much salt.  Further, very thin fries (think McDonalds) mean you get way too much salt in each bite.  The fries were a complete disaster.

A few years ago, we went to the original BRGR and were underwhelmed  We were hoping this would be a different experience.  

Service and interactions with staff went well."}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant. Have been here a few times and I will definitely keep coming back. I especially enjoy the freshness of the food, the happy and helpful staff, and last but not least the amazing sangria."}
{"text":"We are from California, and went here on recommendation. It was a great experience from beginning to end. It was family friendly (our daughter is 11 months).  The service was prompt and friendly. The food was delicious. Good food for a good price. We will be back when we are in town!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, cooked exactly as ordered.   Speciality spiked milkshakes, made with Dave and Andy ice cream are incredible."}
{"text":"While shopping one night I asked a younger looking cashier where I could find a good meal at a decent price.  She quickly recommended BRGR and said I should visit there before I left town.  I stopped in to find a small bar feel.  I sat at the bar and the bartender was very pleasant and accommodating while I was placing my order. The burger I had (Button Buster) along with the tossed fries were out of this world!  A highly recommended stop for anyone visiting Pittsburgh in search for a good burger!"}
{"text":"Good food, ALTHOUGH,  overrated and overpriced.  Burgers aren't that big and u Dont get a side.  Sides are extra.  I had regular beef, some kind of spicy burger which was good.  My dad had a mahi burger which was too fishy.  Do yourself a favor and save some money by driving up the street to Red Robin."}
{"text":"I have to bump it up a star.  I went here on a Sunday afternoon and had a much better experience.  The burgers were better as were the onion rings.  

They had Hopslam on draft, and Founders CBS, and Leviathan.  Did I mention Stoli moscow mules for I think $6?  The Moscow Mule became my favorite cocktail after I had one there.  

Service was great and friendly.  I feel much better about BRGR this time than I did the first time."}
{"text":"Having one of the better burgers out there prevents this BRGR from getting a measly one star. However, the terrible service, along with the above average time for the food to be delivered to the table takes away three of the possible five stars. Recommended to those who want great food, but can also tolerate the ignorant service."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review because I was very happy with BRGR's service, and I happen to think their food is pretty great, too.

A group of 8 friends was planning to invade BRGR on a Friday night, so we knew it would be a long wait.  A few of us went about 45 minutes early to secure a place on the waiting list and have a drink while we waited for our friends (we're pretty nice friends, don't you think?!)  Anyway, as luck would have it, our table was ready within the hour wait time that BRGR gave us, and our other friends were late!  We begged and pleaded with the lovely hostess to not give up her table, but rules are rules, and she had to (FYI - BRGR won't seat you until your entire party is present).  When all of our friends finally showed up, we were convinced that it was going to be another hour.  But, within about 15 minutes, another large table became available, and it was ours!  We were all really pumped, as there were some BRGR first-timers dying to try out the eats.

In addition, the hostess came over not once, but twice!, during our meal to make sure that we were happy with our meal.  Great job all around, BRGR staff.

And, because you want to know about the food ... I've been to BRGR a few times. The salmon burger is awesome, as is the one with carmelized onions (the name escapes me at the moment).  Fries are pretty standard, but still yummy.  The shakes are great!  And, I tried a sip of my friend's spiked root beer float, which I found to be creative and very tasty.  They also have a great selection of craft beers and a good happy hour special (1/2 price drafts, I think).

I'll be back to BRGR and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went here after getting told it's a good spot for burgers so we decided to try it after a movie. I like the ambiance of it, dark wood and animal hides are a cool touch. I ordered the cease and desist burger and it was so good. One of the top burgers I've ever had (I'm from CA, so I know burgers haha). My boyfriend ordered the blue cheese burger and he loved it. We got fries and they were great too. Perfectly crunchy and went well with all the different sauce options on the table. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Good service, but overall bland and disappointing.

Ordered a simple burger medium-rare, with dried blue cheese and bacon.  The burger was cooked to order, very pink inside.  However, it was bland and I could not taste anything other than the bread with the occasional bit of bacon. I tried it without the roll to see if that was holding something back, but wasn't.  There just was no taste to the meat, not even the blue cheese and bacon could save it.  And bacon can save a lot of things you can put bacon on cardboard and it would have made a better tasting burger.

Fries were okay, even if slightly undercooked.

Overall everything was just bland.


Bland."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night around 7:30pm.  Plenty of open seating at the bar/restaurant.  Started with the fried pickles for an appetizer.  Lightly 6 big spears, lightly breaded, with good ranch dip.  Got the BRGR signature burger, medium.  Cooked to specification, unique toppings/flavor combinations.  Agree with others that you should share a basket of fries.  I can eat a lot, and the two of us could not finish off a basket of fries.  Recommend the truffle cheese whiz to go with them.  Did not have room for a shake, but they sound good.  Will get one next time.  Decor is nice inside.  Our waiter, Brian was very nice.  Would go back."}
{"text":"Three words - I loved it! I loved the vibrant atmosphere, filled with burgers and fries and tall tumblers of shakes with ambient lighting and customers of all ages and kinds of groups. The food is delicious! I got a shroomz (mushroom, brie, some kind of mustard dressing) and my companion got the kind with guacamole and jalapenos. The fries are crisp (pretty close to pomme frites) and sprinkled with herbs and parmesan. 

I am not sure what is there not to like about BRGR! I think the place adds awesome and much needed twist to Pittsburgh's American cuisine. Well if you do not like guacamole on your burger, then may be this place is not for you. However, if you appreciate the line of contemporary resturants like Avenue B, Salt, Elements, etc. go to BRGR and enjoy! 

Oh for those non-Shadysiders, parking is free in the covered lot by Fedex, Plum, Borders, etc. Don't go to the paid lot on the other side on Highland. Also it gets really busy, so go on a weekday if you can. Otherwise, totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"will not be back. this was my third visit and as was the last two visits the service was terrible . sat at the bar and again only one bartender for a busy crowd. the bartender was slow and very unfriendly."}
{"text":"The Kobe beef burger cooked medium was second to none.  The french fries with cheeze whiz were the best fries I have ever tasted.  The service was good and the online service to see how long of a wait you have is an excellent tool."}
{"text":"BF surprised me and took me here for late lunch. the place is huge! we stopped in the middle of the week and there was probably 4 other couples there. the staff looked pretty bored, all stood around pretending to work, one staff was cold so she literally walked around covered up in her blanket...very professional! not. anyways wait staff didn't seem to enjoy her work either nor did she stopped by frequently for anything. I honestly was not happy with the staff but the food made up 100%! bf ordered the button buster and I ordered the shrimp po boy and we both shared an order if tater tots! there were condiments on the table and the crack dip was really crack dip, soon as I dipped a piece of tater tot into it, I seriously was hooked! must go there again soon!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is wayy over hyped.  For being such a trendy place I would expect much better.  The burgers are ok but don't compare to the other top burger spots around the city.  Stop by BRGR if you want to pay $20 for an overcooked & undersized burger and a small side of fries.  I also found a rubberband in the truffel cheese whiz--yummy!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice since we moved to the Burgh. It's convenient, the atmosphere is nice, and the food is pretty good.

The veggie burger was too soft and salty, so on our second trip here I got the king salmon burger and it was muchhh better. I wish the buns were not so soft, maybe they could grill them, since the veggie/fish burgers are not very firm. 

What makes this place for me is the sides! I love the fried pickles, they have the perfect crunchy shell and the pickles themselves are tasty! Onion rings were good but not amazing, I really enjoy the dips you can select for the fries. 

I got a beertail last time I was here and it was pretty good, not too sweet so it goes well with the food!

Not the best burger I have ever had but it's good and we've never had a problem getting a table."}
{"text":"Pretty much the same review here as i have for Burgatory, I just knocked them down a star here because they have no create a burger option in East Liberty. 

Portion sizes are good. Food is tasty. Still yet another place that insists on cooking in rancid vegetable oil unfortuantely, but that's everybody. Butter, lard, bacon fat, etc. please. Healthier and tastes better. I enjoyed the double Yoi.

I would go back if in the area but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Well. It started off bad with the bartender taking forever to come over and get a drink order.  She was too busy talking to a couple a few chairs down.  When she finally decided to stop by I ordered coffee and water. I received the water quickly however the coffee didn't arrive for about 10min. I would understand if they had been out and she had mentioned having to brew more... however this was not communicated.  When the burger finally arrived it just seemed to be extremely bland.  Overall very disappointing"}
{"text":"I had my doubts but this place is pretty good. I wish they had a sample platter for their apps because the tots and fried pickles were awesome yet they are huge! Burgers are a good size and drinks were cold fresh and decent pricing, food is priced fair too.

I am not a fan of the bench seating where you are basically sitting two feet away from someone else hearing their every word as they hear yours, but they do have tables and I prefer the bar."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the place was very nice and trendy. The menu was rather brief just burgers no appetizers at all. I ordered a button bottom n a basket of fries and to be honest it wasn't that good. The bun was soft the patty was to dry, I ordered well done patty which slightly bitter!"}
{"text":"2 stars for burgers, although would be 0 stars based on rude hostesses and waitress we had. Much better places than to get treated that way.  It was though every request on our waitress was a bother and the hostesses, either on their own or based on the way they are trained, hover over you to urge you to finish faster to turn the table. For fast food and better burger go to Five Guys.  Save your time"}
{"text":"Service was AWESOME!! Beer flight was AWESOME!! I travel quite a bit but the burger was great for the price. I forgot the name but it had crispy onions, burger, aioli and blue cheese...I think It was the steakhouse burger. I also had the house fries and they were super de super salty--Not really my thing. It is good for kids & it's reasonably priced and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"My first experience dining at BRGR was for a girls' night...because, evidently, when it comes to my friends and I, \"girls' night\" means \"chow down on burgers, beer, and milkshakes\"...the picture of femininity and grace. I've been there many times since, happily introducing my family and a handful of friends to this fun little burger place, and it's definitely at the top of my list for \"best burger joint.\"

With a trendy indoor dining and bar area and fantastic little outdoor section (located upstairs, with a view of...well, the street...but still nice), this place is perfect any time of year (the upper area is open even in the wintertime, thanks to a generous collection of heating units and patio torches). If you're not looking for a burger, you should avoid it, because that's about all you're going to find on their menu (aside from a salad or two and a selection of fattening but oh-so-delicious sides). This place is called BRGR (supposed to kind of look like and sound like \"burger,\" I believe) for a reason: they offer burgers; handcrafted, sloppy, delicious burgers. On top of traditional beef patties (topped with ingredients that actually make them far from traditional), the restaurant also offers a selection of nontraditional burgers (tuna, turkey, vegetarian, salmon, and more, depending on the season and the chef's changing interests). Some burgers, like the kobe beef burger, are pretty much always available, while others come and go throughout the year (my favorite disappearing burger was an amazing lamb burger with Greek cheese, cucumber, and other Mediterranean-ish ingredients). The \"Average Joe\" is about as basic as you get, but I recommend you travel outside your comfort zone and try one of their other delicious, handcrafted creations: \"Fire in the Hole\" (with jalapenos and sriracha, for those who like a little heat), \"California Lovin'\" (a  turkey burger that will make you rethink the whole concept of turkey--it's not just for Thanksgiving and school lunch sandwiches anymore), \"Kamikazi\" (the best sushi ever, but burger-style), and \"Kobe Beef\" (featuring bleu cheese, oven-roasted tomatoes, and other deliciousness). Be sure to add a side of fries with truffle cheese whiz (this is not your average cheese out of a can--it's a creamy cheese sauce blended with truffle oil), or perhaps the house-made chips (served with \"crack dip,\" an amazing concoction that should come with all chips ever). If you have a dessert stomach, like me, or if you simply plan ahead and don't stuff yourself, save room for one of their spiked milkshakes. \"Salty Caramel\"--made with vanilla ice cream, caramel sauce, sea salt, and bourbon--is phenomenal. \"Cupajoe\" is great for coffee and chocolate lovers alike, and non-alcoholic shakes are available for the kiddos. Aside from all of this, they have a pretty good beer selection and offer mixed drinks too.

This is a fun place to head to with friends, or visit for a casual date night, and it's in a great location (near lots of shopping and a few other restaurants). Parking can be a bit tricky (you can't park in the garage across the street, because it's reserved for shoppers at that shopping \"mall\" area), and the area a few blocks over is a wee bit sketchy, but neither of these things are major issues.

So, if you've got a hankering for a burger, skip the craptastic offerings at your local fast food joint and head to BRGR. Just make sure to come on an empty stomach. And don't forget about the truffle cheese whiz. It makes everything better. Everything."}
{"text":"I was not a fan of BRGR.
Being a build-your-own-burger restaurant fan, I was excited about one opening up so close to home and not having to drive to Robinson to go to THE OTHER DIY BURGER PLACE (now referred to as ODIYBP).
I happen to be a regular at ODIYBP.

I was pleasantly surprised at the beer selection, and the prices definitely beat ODIYBP's
....the burgers though?
Not great.
First of all, if burgers are your restaurant's specialty, why would you choose a ground beef mixture that is so greasy that the bun liquifies within minutes of the beef patty hitting it?
Secondly, knowing that your ground beef has such a high fat content that it's going to be a greasy mess, why would you not choose to use buns that hold up to the amount of grease seeping out of your burger??

That aside, I found that ALL I could taste was salt.
Everyone at my table commented on the saltiness of their food.
No side dishes are included, so I ordered the potato chips, and they were about as good as my burger.
Which is to say, not good. I don't know if the frying oil was old or if they'd just sat out for hours. Maybe a combo of both. Who knows.

Tl,dr: go to Burgatory instead."}
{"text":"Easily the best hamburger I have ever had.  Was it expensive? Oh yes, but it was entirely worth it.  Such is ground dry-aged ribeye and a tomato you can actually taste.  We seem to be living at the right time to witness the advent of designer burgers.  BRGR succeeds at what so many other fancy burger restaurants fail.  I have two classes of burger places: one for Five Guys and another for BRGR.  Don't eat here expecting a cheap burger.  Eat here expecting the best burger.  

100% worth a visit.  The best meat + the best bun + the best toppings = the best hamburger."}
{"text":"Eaten here often enough to want to eat here more often... great milk shakes, fries, and an assortment of burger styles that doesn't lose the taste of the meat.  They also treat my kids well (breaking a shake in two, crayons, or just being nice).  After missing burgers from my time in Los Angeles, it is nice to have choices here."}
{"text":"30 minutes after placing our food order - 45 minutes after arriving our waiter informed us they were out of an ingredient for one of our selections.   I suspect the order wasn't placed until then as other patrons were seated in and served by the same waiter well after we arrived.  No apology and no consideration was given.   Will not return."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place and burgers are outstanding. I've had many top notch burgers and their burger rates in my top 5 (as a reference point my #1 is the burger at Minetta Tavern in NYC)."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if I possibly could. I left this location less than two minutes ago. Myself and a group of 5 other adults all walked in after dinner and purchased one drink each. We then sat outside and after finishing our first drink were told by the bartenders that they were no longer allowed to serve us. We asked to speak to a manager to see as to why we were cut off and the manager told us the Bartenders had reported us too intoxicated. 30 year olds having had one drink? Awful service from a manager having no answer or example of any behavior that would call for their decision. In the past the staff has been cold and at times rude and this last visit proved that yes they are rude, unprofessional, and have no regards for customer service. We will never return and make sure we spread the word to everybody. We recommend Houlihans in the same mall if you are looking for ANY customer service!"}
{"text":"I've been to BRGR twice now (lunch and dinner) and had good experiences both times. Service was fine, a bit slow but the restaurant was packed both times and our servers were attentive. I enjoyed everything I tried: the turkey burger has a \"patty\" of stuffing with cranberries that's especially tasty. The salmon burger was good but fell apart too easily. My friend loved her veggie burger (a mix of falafel and lentils). The onion rings and fries were excellent and served in generous portions. And the boozy milkshakes were INSANELY delicious (especially the salted caramel). They're made with Dave & Andy's ice cream and quite large -- I couldn't finish mine, even though I desperately wanted to. I can tell this is going to be one of our regular haunts."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and was excited to see that the menu said that they had fresh local beef. However, I was sad to find out that this is not true. We asked where the meat was from and one of the servers went so far as to tell us that they got their meat from Curtze Farms. The menu says Curtze Meats. So because I am serious about ethical farming I called Curtze and they said they are a distributor and their meat is from all over the mid-west (where most American meat is from). It's not local at all they just deliver within Pittsburgh. It is just frustrating that they are using the term \"local\" in a dishonest way.

As far as the flavor of the food goes, it's ok."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers... different types of toppings to suit your needs and good selection of beer. The basic fries have some seasoning and cheese shreds on them... tasty. 

My friend and I split one of the spiked milkshakes for dessert... We had the cherry soda/whiskey/chocolate ice cream one... as I type that it seems just as gross as it actually tasted. We should've known. 

A good stop for a basic lunch... but skip the alcoholic milkshakes."}
{"text":"I went here because my co-worker swore by it and still swears by it, but I will never go back. 

My fiance and I went in one evening, and were able to be seated right away which was great. 
Then our waitress came by and asked if we had ever been before and we said no. She just kind of shrugged it off like \"oh, oh well you're here now.\" When it came time to order I told her I have an onion and onion powder allergy, so I had a few options picked out and asked if any of them would be able to be made without the onion or onion powder. She told me no and that my only option was absolutley no seasoning without even attempting to make it look like she would check with the kitchen for me. Not even a \"would you like salt and pepper?\" as an option!
 I was a waitress for 6 years, and I know how demanding people can be, but she didn't even attempt to make it look like she cared, she just wanted to be done with us. We got our food, obviously it was bland and tasteless, and she never tried to see if there was anything she could do for us to make it better.
All in all, the food normally is probably better, but the unenthusiastic service leaves such a bad taste in your mouth, it's hard to tell."}
{"text":"Consistently amazing service every visit for the past few years! Never a wait and great food options."}
{"text":"The first time I visited this location I ordered the Fire in the Hole burger since I'm a huge fan of spicy food. My food was delicious.The service here wasn't so great. Honestly I didn't feel like my server even deserved a tip. I thought that this may have been a one time occurrence and the server may have been having a bad day. However, the second time  I visited BRGR I was met with the same result. The server that I had that day was also very rude. The food was good though. That's the only reason why I'm giving this place three stars."}
{"text":"Relax! Why the attitude? By the attitude of the servers here I would almost think I were in New York trying to get a table on friday night. These people don't seat incomplete parties and don't like it if you sit down and only order drinks. Come on! It's East Liberty, not Tribeca. Other than this place trying too hard to be exclusive, the burgers and milkshakes are good. On the other hand, they are way overpriced, considering the fact that they are just burgers and milkshakes. Served in East Liberty."}
{"text":"It's fine if you're looking for a flavorless greasy, beef patty. But if it's an umami overload you want, I recommend Burgatory. The apps are spot on! But the burgers lack seasoning."}
{"text":"Good bison burger which was thick and juicy. Got the regular fries and fresh cut and now realize one side is plent to share. Fresh cut were better."}
{"text":"This was our first visit, and we were very satisfied. We both really liked our burgers (Santa Fe Hippie and Shrooms). The onion rings paired great with BRGR sauce. We finished by sharing a Red Velvet Cake hard shakes, and it was fantastic. Sitting up on the top floor patio added to the experience, although we started feeling bad for the staff who had to keep walking the stairs!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just had dinner.  The service was excellent..The food was very very fresh and we'll portioned..The atmosphere was very relaxed..and the pricing and creativity of the menu was fantastic!!!! I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"I went for a birthday dinner here with a friend of mine and had a mixed experience. I ordered a beer based upon the recommendation of the server. She said that since the beer was listed as \"nitro,\" it would be smooth and have a light pumpkin flavor. The beer ended up tasting like watered down, light beer. The \"Shrooms\" burger was satisfactory, however the sautéed onions turned out to make me severely ill. We visited the restaurant on a Sunday night and happened to be the last two left in the dining room around 9:45 when the owner came to our table and curtly asked us to leave. I doubt that I will visit again because he failed to even ask how our meal was or give us warning the establishment was closing; to top it off he made it quite evident as we finished our conversation outside to pop his head out and lock the door (as if we were going to break back in to sit down). I can think of several other locally owned  restaurants where the owner would be more than happy to thank me for my patronage."}
{"text":"Never Again. Don't believe the hype. Food was disappointing and the ambiance was lacking. The staff treated us like an inconvenience and they were out of several beers and burger toppings. Save yourself the time and money and get a BigMac instead."}
{"text":"Very nice place, I would go again. I stopped in for lunch and felt welcomed, met the manager for a personal reason, very nice and helpfull. The bar tender was great very nice, she did somewhat forget my beer but she was nice about it and kept me happy. The food came out in a kindly matter. A quick 20 min lunch was great. Good job guys keep it up"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, beautiful wide tables, delicious condiments (ketchup, mustard, cheez wiz, etc all taste hand made), awesome boozy milkshakes w/ Dave & Andy's ice cream, perfect onion rings.  Perfect place to catch up with friends with a nice relaxed atmosphere.

Burgers are just OK (7.5 of 10) but everything else is so comfortable, modern, and well done that its a pleasure to eat here."}
{"text":"Went today with some friends for a little Sunday afternoon recovery. The menu is simple and not too pricey. I got the cease and desist and it was very good. We split a round of fries with the truffle cheese whiz which was delicious and only .50 extra. Service was a little slow but the waiter was nice and friendly. Would've been a 5 star experience has the mimosa not been $9!  A little ridiculous considering you can get a mimosa carafe elsewhere in the area for much less. Overall will be back for a mimosa-less brunch."}
{"text":"Excellent service, clean restaurant.  Was a little surprised that sides weren't included, but the orders sides were inexpensive for the quantity.  We ordered the tater tots, a large basket that was more than enough for the three of us.  Burgers were flavorful an cooked precisely to order."}
{"text":"I got take out from the BRGR in Cranberry. The food was OK. I was kinda disappointed in my burger for the price I paid. They even forgot to give us our Bam-Bam milkshakes. It wasn't noticed until it was too late! I honestly think the apps are way better than the burgers themselves. I prefer Burgatory."}
{"text":"I'm officially done with BRGR. The service is lackluster and they can't seem to make their food correctly. 

When I moved to Pgh 2 years ago BRGR quickly became my favorite restaurant and I would eat there at least once a month. At first it was great every time. But after a few months, my experiences changed and not for the better. For about the past year or year and a half, my food has been wrong 9 times out of 10. I have a lot of allergies, so I am never able to order straight off a menu without adjustments, so I am used to some errors, but 90% of the time is ridiculous. And frequently my companions' food has been wrong as well, even when they ordered exactly as the item is listed on the menu. Additionally, not once have I been apologized to by a manager, even when I have mentioned to the server the frequency with which I have issues. In fact generally the servers themselves barely apologize.

I have stopped going to BRGR for the most part, but the other night it ended up being the most convenient option for a friend and I to grab a bite to eat. First my burger had an item on it that I am allergic to and had asked to have left off. They had to talk my burger back. When they brought it out again I cut into what should have been a well done burger and it was clearly pink. At that point I told the server that they could take it away and not replace it. Getting my order wrong twice is unacceptable. Once again, no apology from a manager and a half-hearted apology from the server. Additionally my companion's burger was ordered medium rare and although he ate it as it came, it was less less than rare. His burger was barely cooked. Then about 15 minutes after I sent back my second burger and clearly stated to two different bartenders that I wasn't interested in a replacement, one of the bartenders brought a new version of my burger telling me that there was a miscommunication and the kitchen remade my food anyway. They really can't get it together. I refused the burger because at that point my companion was done and I didn't want to spend any more time at BRGR. And who's to say it would have even been right? And if it had been correct, at that point I didn't want to pay for a burger it took them 3 times and the better part of an hour to get right.

Let's talk about the money for a minute. Obviously at this most recent visit, my burger was taken off my bill since I never even had a bite, but otherwise I have never had a discount of any amount or any sort of compensatory offer to make up for any of the times I have had a poor experience. Why should I keep giving BRGR my money when they can't get it together and they seem to not be bothered about that fact? The food is good when it is right, but it is not so good that I am going to keep taking that chance. But the ultimate thing for me: the overall service experience is ABYSMAL and I refuse to keep rewarding that with my business. And I will be telling my friends to stay away too."}
{"text":"KOBE WAS AWESOME! A GREAT ADDITION TO EAST LIBERTY - SOLID BAR FOOD ELEGANTLY ELEVATED!

Looks like me and a bunch of my yelp foodie friends hit up BRGR all within a couple days of one another!

 Impressed by local food critic/bitter Betty AKA CHINA MILLMANs review for The Pittsburgh Post Gazette we decided to stop by and stuff our faces! 

Hubby and I went Saturday night at 6pm. We were seated right away and had already reviewed the menu via the critics column. I knew right away if I would be noshing on red meat (a rarity for me) I was going to the top of the line - the Kobe burger! Hubby had the short rib burger and we split a order of fries and onion rings.

Sides: Onion rings were textbook perfect. Batter was even and crunchy. Ratio of all parts was harmonious. Fries were solid but not amazing or life changing. Instead, a solid counterpart.

Kobe: Juicy, rich, luxurious, velvety...I fell in love with it! Bun was so perfect and sturdy and flavorful. It was a food slut moment. I ate like a person possessed!

Shake of the Day: \"What Girls Are Made Of\" ANSWER = Pumpkin Pie Spice and Egg Nog? Totally off base - flavors were not unique rather a disappointing reminder of holiday punch. I regret not trying the salty caramel.

Summary: Great casual bar with wonderful food. Brgr is not full of itself. This place is serving great food in a relaxed, fun, family friendly bar and I will come back!"}
{"text":"As a \"cheap eats\" place (as much as such a thing exists in the Shadyside area), this is one of my favorites.  I am not a huge burger person, but I thoroughly enjoy the burgers here.  They are creative but not overly so, flavorful, and extremely tasty.  I typically order the \"Button Buster\" cooked medium, and it is always enjoyable.  I also find both their onion rings and french fries to be excellent.

The atmosphere is very nice, and service tends to be very good as well.

However, on one or two occasions, when the restaurant was very busy, I have had disappointing service and my burger came out overcooked.  Their staff was nonetheless extremely accommodating for this issue.

If you're looking for a restaurant where you can have some very tasty burgers, a few other sides or starters, and get out spending no more than $15-20 a person with tip, Brgr is a very solid choice."}
{"text":"This place is so great that on a two day business trip to Pittsburgh I usually eat here both nights!  Everything on the menu is awesome, especially the bourbon caramel milkshake and the season slaw side."}
{"text":"This place is just too hyped up.  I ordered a burger medium well and it was oozing red on the inside.  i could barely fit my mouth around it.  I'm sorry but burgers are 100% about perfect proportioning of quality ingredients.  If you want to make a bigger bugger, make it bigger in a direction that makes sense.  Burgers are my favorite food, but I was not thrilled by this place.  Stack'd in shadyside is better for 1/4 the price.  Also the restaurant was freezing cold!  I was sat at a teeny high table where our plates could barely fit even though the restaurant was mostly empty.  I didn't like the way the burgers were served also, they were crammed in a tiny basket that made it hard to eat.  Don't get me wrong this place isn't bad, but there are so many other places nearby that will give you better food/atmosphere for a fraction of brgr price."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Service was slow and sloppy. Burger was over cooked and light on the meat. Fries were way over salted. Shake was almost bitter and difficult for me to drink - the best part was watching the bartender roll his eyes and shake his head at me after I sent it back - how's that for customer service? All around an expensive $50 meal for 2 people with nothing good to say."}
{"text":"Milkshakes are good, burgers are good also but this place is no burgertory. Nice place, not to noisy, sports games playing, hipster music in the background and good service makes this place good enough to come back to."}
{"text":"We were visiting Pittsburgh and craving a good burger. Everyone enjoyed what they ordered so it seems you can't go wrong. I ordered their most popular burger, The BRGR, but made my own alterations which I always appreciate about a restaurant. We also ordered the poutine fries to share which were delicious. Don't forget to save room for their infamous milkshakes which you can order virgin or spiked. I ordered the spiked cookies n cream shake and loved it!"}
{"text":"I loved BRGR and plan to take family and friends here!

The Dude Abides milkshake was DELICIOUS, my Tree Hugger burger was enormous and flavorful, and the \"side order\" of fries was way more than enough for two people to share. 

Our waitress was friendly and informative, and the food came out surprisingly quickly (..though we did visit on a Tuesday night).

My only complaint is the lack of variety for vegetarians - since I plan to be a repeat customer, I'd love more non-meat flavor concoctions than just falafel-lentil. I'm sure whatever the chefs at BRGR come up with would be well-executed."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Good burgers and fries. Their signature burgers are tasty blends, not just stuff thrown together for creativity sake. The fries are pretty good as well.  Nice ambiance, lots of TVs.  Seems like a nice spot for lunch or the evening.  I've ordered take out since going there the first time. One thing I don't like is that they charge separately for burgers and fries instead of in combos, but that's fine really. Nice place."}
{"text":"Pretty solid falafel veggie burger that they make in-house, for all of you vegetarians out there. The regular burgers looked great too and my friends comments also support that. Our group got several baskets of various fried things, all of which were very tasty. I hear they also have an extensive menu of milk shakes that are good, but I didn't try any myself.

Trendy decor and dining accouterments, even if I thought it pretentious that the name of the restaurant is actually \"B\" \"R\" \"G\" \"R\" and not \"burger\". This restaurant is right next to Spoon, and both are owned by the same person(s) and share kitchens 

Similar to my experience with Six Penn Kitchen, I took a colleague here for lunch as a farewell for good luck in his new job he was moving on to. BRGR was a great place to go for the occasion and it had a nice atmosphere. The front of the building has garage doors, so I imagine those get opened in the summer months."}
{"text":"Garbage.... The staff is soooo rude I didn't even order food and left. The place is always packed so they feel like they can treat guests like garbage. 

Anywho, the burgers are over hyped and my burger was soooooo dry and disgusting. Never... Again..."}
{"text":"Unable to visit the much-hyped (and farther away) Burgatory, our party heeded a friend's recommendation to visit this more conveniently located, burger-focused eatery for Sunday lunch. We had tried to go the night prior, but the wait for four was 1.5 hours (!). Fortunately, the wait for our party of 7 was a more reasonable 30 minutes, but the bar was mostly empty so we chose to dine there immediately. I can't really speak to the normal, table-based service, but our bartender was quite gregarious and affable. She provided great menu suggestions and even helped us make plans for later in the evening.

BRGR has a fairly solid tap and bottle list, with only a draft line or two dedicated to common swill and the rest to quality, craft brews. The food didn't quite match expectations but still hit the spot. My bison burger was overcooked past the requisite medium rare and seemed to lack the promised crunchy onion straws, but was nonetheless tasty with smoky chipotle aioli, tender mushrooms, and sharp cheddar. In contrast, my companion's \"Fire in the Hole\" arrived at a perfect medium rare and was quite delicious. 

Ditto on another friend's short rib \"Button Buster,\" which leads one to believe the kitchen possesses more skill with cooking beef than the menu's more exotic offerings. The quality of the patties (both bison and beef) shone in the burgers. Vegetarian friends enjoyed their veggie burgers, which boasted a falafel patty rather than the de rigueur fake meat/mixed vegetable variety.

Sides were exemplary, especially the wholesome, crispy-creamy-zesty Cajun tater tots. It's unfortunate you have to pay extra for fries/tots/onion rings but that's the way this joint does things, I guess. At least the side portions are big enough to share. I couldn't taste what was \"spiked\" about BRGR's coffee milkshake, but it nonetheless was tasty and a good example of dairy craft. BRGR can be a little pricey and the waits can be surprisingly long (no reservations and a 1.5 hour wait for 4 on Saturday night), but if the burger craving strikes this place's creations will undoubtedly hit the spot."}
{"text":"It was the first time eating here and we ordered fries, tots, Chachos, and a Regular Joe Burger. The Fries were amazing, loved the cheese topping. The Cajun Tots were GREAT too, but probably not the best match with the Chachos. I liked the twist using potato chips instead of tortilla chips in Nachos, but i wasn't expecting a barbecue type seasoning on the chips. It was really good at first, but after eating half the dish I had enough. The chips would have been better plain since it was topped with other delicious flavors of shredded chicken, guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream and another type of sauce. The burger was GREAT, very juicy and a good size and presentation. 

I would give 5 stars but they lose one for service.
The host seating us was nice, but the waitress seemed a little MIA. Normally I don't mind if they are busy with other tables/guest, but there was only 2 other tables and it was 4pm. When I finally saw her walking by I asked for togo boxes (and assumed she would bring the check). She brought two small boxes and then walked away. I waited for 5 more minutes for her to come back but didn't see her so I walked over to the host and asked for my check and a third box for the rest of my food. He said he would get the waitress for me, who came back 5 minutes later with another box and the bill and then quickly left again. You would think that it would be common sense to bring out a bag for my left overs considering I had three boxes, but guess it wasn't to her. We waited a little big for her to come back to get a bag, but just got annoyed and asked the host to get it.

I hope they split tips because aside from taking out order, the waitress wasn't very helpful."}
{"text":"I tried the BRGR's burger for the first time. It was cooked to my specification but lacked any flavor. I got the original dry aged beef. The server was friendly & attentive. I happened to ask if they had Mojitos and the server said I can make you one, I agreed and it was very tasty! Mojito was priced only $2.50!(virgin & not a happy hour price). I will probably try there burger again to give them a better rating."}
{"text":"With all the hype around BRGR and them having a dedicated spot in PNC Park, my girlfriend and I wanted to stop by as she was having a friend visit from out of town and this seemed like a good spot. Such a mediocre experience.

Parking:
-Zero parking in the immediate area as there are typically no spots on the street as there are many businesses around Highland St. and Penn Circle that compete for parking. Valet is available but this type of dining doesn't merit valet. 

Hostess:
-The entrance is nice enough but finding a table can be tricky, I smartly used the No Wait app (also used by Burgatory) to skip the lines and ensure a table was ready. I arrived with \"1 party ahead of you in line\" status on the app. When called to the hostess podium I was told we could sit at a high-top table at the bar or go upstairs and look for seating. The bar is no place for a nice dinner so we went upstairs and felt the air conditioning slowly taper off to nothing. Arriving on the rooftop area there was no airflow whatsoever on a hot and humid day. I went back downstairs to ask if we could get a regular table as it was intensely hot upstairs. Surprise surprise a table was ready. I can't imagine how some guests were eating upstairs, the AC on the first floor was appropriate for the weather. 

Service:
Our waiter clearly had better days, maybe he was upset he was working during the Pen's Stanley Cup game or was just over the day in general but his service was unimpressive. Does anyone have customer service skills anymore? 

Food:
The food was the best part of the experience which is a positive but still can't save a poor experience and two star review. I had the salmon burger which was decent but a little dry. The tater tots I ordered as a side were the best part of the meal which is a little disappointing. My girlfriend ordered fries with the famed truffle cheese wiz. I didn't care for it but I'll chalk it up to possibly not liking truffles. 


Definitely won't be going back to BRGR, go next door to Spoon or across the street to Plum Pan Asia and get some much higher quality food."}
{"text":"I finally decided to give BRGR a try. I'm burger fanatic and I was unfortunately very disappointed in my entire experience here. First my boyfriend and I wait several minutes before even being acknowledged by the waitress and another several before getting menus. I decide on plain and simple, The Average Joe. Im fine with an up charge for fries but I've never seen a burger at a restaurant that doesn't at least come with chips! I give in to the $4.50 fries because I like a side to my burgers. The food at least came quickly but our waitress neglected to bring silverware, napkins, ketchup etc. After finally getting settled with all the proper condiments and utensils I bite into my food. The burger was over cooked and seemed to lack a juicy flavor. You could get a better and cheaper burger from 5 guys! Our waitress was not great at refilling drinks and even forgot when asked. I do think they were understaffed but the neglect was ridiculous. Overall for a high end burger joint they did not deliver on service or quality of food for the price you are paying."}
{"text":"Food is fine but the atmosphere is not very good.  I was there on a Wednesday night.  There were kids and grandparents.  The music was top 40 hits from the 90s.  I think the drink are overpriced.  the upstairs seating does not have a good feel.  There is absolutely no reason to go to BRGR instead of Tessaro's.  Sorry for the poor review."}
{"text":"I visited the East Liberty location for lunch one afternoon in early October.  The service at the bar was great and I really enjoyed my burger.  I was happy to find some yummy pumpkin beer on tap which made my day even better.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Vegans beware: the company now carries the impossible burger which is a product designed to promote plant based eating but they do not offer a plant based roll!"}
{"text":"After having one of the best All-American burger meals at the BURGR in Las Vegas, I was psyched to take my mom to the BRGR in Pittsburgh when visiting hime from California

I mistakenly thought they were the same establishment (in Pittsburgh they sneak the extra R out of their name), but they are in fact not the same. BURGR is great, BRGR is not.

The mushroom burger was undercooked and the bread was soggy (seemed like a McDonald's bun - not even toasted). The fried pickles had no seasoning or character. It was simply a pickle, fried. No original preparation.

The only good thing about this place is the wait staff. They are friendly. Too bad they have to be at the forefront dishing out the crap from the kitchen. They deserve better.

Do not go here."}
{"text":"I so want to love BRGR, but every time I make the trip, I find myself disappointed. To start, the wait staff is chilly and aloof. I have never had the experience of dining at BRGR and feeling as if the staff cared about their work or the quality of product - as a server myself, I can only assume this has something to do with management.

My most recent meal at BRGR was especially disappointing. I ordered my burger medium rare, but it arrived really very rare. I can get down with a rare burger - especially at Burgatory, where they get a great sear on the patty - but not this one. Inside, the beef was cold and mealy, so I asked for it to be brought up a bit. My server said, \"So you want it medium?\" I responded that I wanted it as ordered - medium rare. It came back medium, and was honestly just not very carefully prepared. The lettuce was wilted, the tomatoes were watery and the cheese not melted.

Again, I am a server, and not much bothers me more at work than the first world problems of entitled guests. What gets me down about BRGR is not necessarily the fact that I wasn't served a perfect meal, but that their disregard, both for customers and product is painfully evident. BRGR could be great if their team cared to make it so."}
{"text":"3-4 stars. 

I guess I had too high expectations. \"Gourmet burger\"... I was expecting, well, I don't really know what I was expecting, something gourmet perhaps? 

Not that the burgers were bad, not at all, they are perfectly fine, the meat was cooked as I wanted it, and the bun was tasty. 

I guess the problem is with the concept of a gourmet burger. Oh well.

Also, the fries were  a massive letdown. Frankly, in a gourmet burger, it would be nice to have tastier fries - you know the kind of fries you are sure they were not frozen. 

The milkshakes were also a mild disappointment. Pretty good, but not that fancy.

On the other hand, that's a nice place (despite the very many TVs...: that's a bit distracting): adult, comfortable, slightly upscale but not pretentious. The prices are reasonable, the food is good, the beer menu is large, the service competent, and not overbearing. So, I'll probably be back. Perhaps I'll move it to 4 stars."}
{"text":"BRGR isn't bad, it just isn't great.  I got the \"Cease and desist,\" which has onions, cheese, and thousand island sauce.  The burger was cooked properly and all the ingredients seemed to stand on their own, but it just didn't wow me.  I probably wouldn't resist going back here, but I don't think I'd make a strong effort. (4/5 for the burger)

The fries were also a little bit of a disappointment.  Fries tossed with Parmesan and herbs sounds good right?  Yes, if it can be if done properly.  However, I thought BRGR's fries were a bit overcooked and hard.  The cheese and herbs kind of just stuck together and didn't seem to add a lot of flavor. (2/5 for the fries)"}
{"text":"BRGR has really good burgers, onion rings, and milkshakes.  Nice casual, trendy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Burgers are good, but the service is terrible. I waited 15-20 minutes before a server even came to take my order."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positives first. We used the NoWait app as this place is always busy and once we arrived we only had to wait about 20  minutes. They have a very nice seating area to wait. The place was packed and our waiter was fantastic. I felt bad as they were down a milkshake maker and all the servers had to make their own. That must have been a pain on a busy Saturday evening.  This place is very kid friendly and a great place for families. This was a negative for me as we were trying to enjoy a date night and kids were running around everywhere making a mess.  The wait staff must be used to this as they did not bat an eye and did an excellent job cleaning up the place after each party left.  

Now onto the food which left me pretty disappointed. I ordered a regular burger with lettuce, onion, tomato and sharp cheddar cheese. It was mediocre and also $9.  The burgers come with nothing-I mean come on at least give us a few chips. Nope you have to pay $4.5 for chips which come with a cheesy, meat dipping sauce that is not good.  I wanted a side salad and they can only give you 1/2 salads of their entrée salad. I went with half of the Cesar salad and the dressing must be made with anchovies which I do not like at all.  We topped the night off with a nonalcoholic salted caramel pretzel milkshake which is pretty darn tasty but to be honest they are better at Burgatory."}
{"text":"Seriously the BEST burger I've ever had.  Fast service, great food, and great atmosphere....  what else could you want?"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant. The menu has a lot of variety that will appease any taste bud. I've had the Santa Fe, and I've had the burger with the foie to boot. Some say it's pricey, but it's freaking foie! nomnomnom My homeland of California banned this deliciousness, so I'm perfectly happy BRGR will legally give me some (thanks!)

Another burger that's my fave here though is the Turkey Cranberry. It must be seasonal because I had it in November last year and have been secretly waiting for its return. It's literally thanksgiving in 2 fluffy buns- turkey with cornbread stuffing, greens, cranberry, and gravy aioli. I'd have one every month of the year if I could!

(I'm secretly hoping the BRGR powers that be will see this review and know that a year later, I'm still craving it!)"}
{"text":"I literally have been driving past this place for years at this point.  I never really know where to park, though I have always been intrigued by the apparent valet parking sign right in front of the restaurant.  Anyway, I moved into the neighborhood and decided to give it a try. 
The waitress was a little new and was a little hesitant with my gluten free status.  Whatever it was fine.  I ended up ordering a bison burger on a gluten free bun with cucumber and smoked cheddar with a side of coleslaw.  First let me say the side of coleslaw was enormous and looked amazing.  As for the bison burger... well the burger itself was a bit bland and a bit dry.  That being said the added toppings on the burger and the gluten free bun made everything much better.  
Also, there is an upstairs and it is worth it.  The view is pretty good and it is nice and breezy.  Overall, the waiters are nice and the food ok.  I will, however, agree that if you want an excellent burger maybe try Burgatory.  BRGR is really about the location and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had their famous BRGR burger for $13 it was over priced. And just OK however next time I order without the blue cheese on it was overpowering ."}
{"text":"Not the best experience. While it was a Sunday lunch, service was very slow. The food was good, but the person who brought it out was very rude. Just handed the plates to my friend for her pass around to everyone like she worked here too. Just not the best experience and the staff was for sure short."}
{"text":"Wanted to do a back to back burger comparison between burgatory (which I love) and BRGR. Went to burgatory on a friday. Next day tried really hard to order a custom burger that would be as close to the one I ordered at burgatory as possible.  Emphasis on tried. Every burger comes loaded with stuff- waffles, foi gras,  pickled onion....The plain comes with lettuce tomato and onion.  Limites saucea.tried to get aioli that comes with one of the apps.The bartender told me truffle aioli is like marinara. Wtf. 

The reason for the toppings became immediately clear on the first taste of the burger (which I ordered med rare and got med well) To hide a
tasteless unseasoned beef patty.  With a slice of white cheddar cheese that could not have been thinner. Bacon that tasted like it had been cooked 2 days ago. Reminded me of the cheapest fast food burger to be had. 
I cannot believe the high praise heaped on this place. Save your money and go to mcdonalds"}
{"text":"Great burgers, shakes and cheese fries."}
{"text":"My bf and I have been pretty excited to check out the new location so we stopped in today for takeout. The place was clean and the employees we encountered were pleasant. It wasn't very busy around 12:30ish. Unfortunately weren't too pleased with the food when we got home (a very short walk from BRGR). My burger, while cooked properly to medium-rare, was very salty (and I love salt). The side salad was missing as well as the sauce and pickles for my burger. I had also ordered onion straws but received barely any. My bf also didn't receive his burger sauce and some of his toppings. The Chachos we ordered were OK but nothing special. I'd go back again to see if it was just an 'off' day for them but it might be a while since Burgatory is nearby and very reliable."}
{"text":"The burgers are outstanding but, the customer service could be better. 

My wife, daughter and I decided to give this place a try. I must say I really dig the decor. It is very manly with lots of TVs on the walls, nice shades of blue and grey. Two huge all glass garage doors that open to let the warm weather in. There is a decent size bar area also, There is even a outdoor level on the second floor. 

We were seated promptly and handed menus. We order our drinks. My wife and I got Cokes and our daughter got a chocolate milk. When our drinks came my daughter tasted her milk and said it tasted funny. My wife smelled and tasted it. It was spoiled! I'm glad I didn't get a milkshake if they are using spoiled milk! We flagged down the waitress and told her that our daughter's milk was spoiled. She apologized and said she tasted it before she brought it out. You tasted my daughter's chocolate milk?! Are you going to taste our burgers too? I knew she was full of it because if she did taste it she would have know it was spoiled! She replaced it with a Coke and all was well. 

We already knew what we wanted as we looked at the menu already online but, the burgers we wanted weren't on the menu. Maybe they change ever so often. 

They do offer kids meals. Don't ask me why they are not listed on the menu. For kids meals they offer a cheeseburger, grill cheese or hot dog which includes fries and a drink. My daughter got the cheeseburger and loved it. I believe the kids burger is the same size as a adult burger as she could only finish half of it. 

My wife got the \"Cease & Desist\" which consists of a burger with American cheese, caramelized onions and 1000 island dressing. Pretty much their version of a Big Mac. I had the \"Button Buster\" which consists of a burger topped with braised beef short ribs, white cheddar cheese, béarnaise aioli and crispy onion rings. It was outstanding! I especially liked the bun as it was coated with butter and then lightly toasted. 

My wife and I shared a order of BRGR Fries tossed with parmesan and herbs and topped with cheese whiz. They were really good as well. 

Our waitress came over with drink refills without being asked I might add (which always gets you a few extra bucks in your tip from me), as we were eating to tell us that her shift was over at BrGr and she was going over next door to Spoon to start her shift there. And that we would be taken care of by her replacement. We sat waiting for a good ten to fifteen minutes for our check and a doggy bag. My wife flagged down a waitress would then got our replacement waitress to bring our check. 

Other then our daughter's spoiled milk and taking forever to get our check we really liked BrGr and would have given it 5 stars. We will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"This has been the month of trying places that I should have tried years ago.  I'm actually quite surprised at some of the flack that this place has gotten in earlier reviews.  After sampling some veggie burger goodness from this place at an event I attended a couple years ago, it became close to the top of my list to try. So, I finally went with a friend a couple of weeks ago.  And I tried the veggie burger called the \"hippie\" something or another burger, and it was grrrrrreeeaaattttt (I feel like Tony the Tiger).  The fries were good, the beer was good, the fries were good.  And the venue and wait staff were all pretty great.  An all around good (and yummy) experience."}
{"text":"I was dying to try this place because I live right down the street but wasn't impressed. Don't get me wrong the burgers were good and the meat was cooked perfectly but I just found that my bun was a little soggy (not sure if it's because of the combination I chose because I customized my burger) but it was really messy and hard to eat. I guess I can't be too upset though because that's what you get with any burger. 

We ordered the grilled cheese bites to start, 3 different burgers, and fries and onion rings. All of us liked the flavors of the burgers and we're impressed with the onion rings. They were the best onion rings I've ever had!!!! I really wish the fries were able to just come with truffle oil and not the combo truffle oil and cheese wiz. 

Overall, great service and good burgers. I would definitely head back there with my dad and brother (haha)!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The atmosphere was a bit loud but the food was excellent. I ordered a standard bacon cheeseburger with fries and I figured I would try the Mac&Cheese. The burger was perfection, the fries were nicely seasoned but the mac & cheese was the worst...it was a mix of chilli and mac & cheese and it was a bad combination. They had some type of chipotle mayo sauce which blended well with the ketchup, I ended up drowning my burger and fries in it. Burger 1-5=5. Fries 1-5=5. Mac 0!"}
{"text":"Not my first time here, but sad to report that things have certainly changed in over two years. Now the service is still friendly but much slower. The menu is fairly limited, but the burgers are really good. I was disappointed with my meal. I order the button buster burger in a lettuce wrap. The burger was excellent but the \"lettuce wrap\" was just a chunk of iceberg lettuce on the plate with the burger sitting in top. No wrap at all. I just wonder if the flair if this restaurant when it opened is now gone and the management needs to reinvigorate the whole place."}
{"text":"I live nearby, so this is place is great whenever I'm craving a good burger. I recommend the BRGR burger or Shrooms burger and you definitely have to get the fries with parmesan.  They're so good. I used to live in Erie, so it's cool to see that their meat comes from quality places located there. I've been here a couple times and the burgers are always perfectly cooked to order. It's usually pretty busy but with any luck you can sit and eat at the bar. I also love that BRGR is at PNC Park and they often do promotions at the ballpark where you can text to get free fries and stuff like that."}
{"text":"I like the ambience for a casual meal or drink, but the food is just okay.  The menu is limited and, not surprisingly, made up primarily of burgers.  The creative preparations sound excellent on the page, but the execution is generally just good, not great.  I find the patties (beef, turkey, and veggie) just average, especially given the price.  Also, while I have had a few great servers at BRGR, most of the time I have been underimpressed with the service."}
{"text":"Worst burger I've ever had to pay for! No seasoning on this very very dry burger and was also poorly constructed. 30+ dollars for two hamburgers and ala carte potato salad. Worst lunch in south hills."}
{"text":"Fave burger in Pittsburgh!

The preparations are a little wacky, but just go fir it, dive right in.

I'll go back and get something totally off the wall.  the Truffle Cheese Wiz is made in house, you should eat it."}
{"text":"I am a lifelong burger girl. If a restaurant has a good burger on its menu there is a 95% chance I'm going to order it. This is obviously why I LOVE the plethora of burger joints in this city. BRGR is at the top of my list. So far I've had the Ceast and Desist burger and the Average Joe burger both of which were incredibly delicious in their own ways. The Ceast and Desist incorporates one of my other loves: Thousand Island Dressing! The Average Joe burger is your basic burger but I am a strong believer in the idea, \"if it's not broke, don't fix it!\" I encourage you to add bacon though! 

The shakes are another one of my favorites at BRGR. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the caramel milkshake. My husband got the Hot Chocolate one the other day for his birthday and he said it was delicious too. I definitely recommend splitting a basket of fries with whoever you go with. I usually hate sharing my food but the basket is too big for even this die hard fan to eat by herself.

The only downside is BRGR's popularity. I've gotten lucky a few times and got a table right away but the last time we waited for a half hour for a table on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"I went for lunch a couple days ago on a weekday and the place was packed.  later there was even a wait for some people.  

My lunch date and I had the short rib burger which had onion rings on the burger.  We also shared a greek salad and I'll say that both were decent.

The service was slow and both dishes took a long time to get to the table.  But they have a wide range of burger choices and I can see why so many Pittsburghers frequent the place.  The burgers don't come with a side which is a negative, we didn't bother ordering a side like fries but I will try them the next time I go.  

I'm not a big fan of burgers in the first place but love short ribs.  I might go back but not really anytime soon."}
{"text":"This was my first time at BRGR and I will never go back! There were 3 other parties inside the restaurant. Once we were seated and given the menus by the hostess it took 15 minutes for our server to come and ask about drinks. We debated on leaving. He then dropped off the drinks and did not ask if we were ready to order even though we were. He walked away so quickly we couldn't even grab his attention to tell him we were in fact ready. he finally came back to take our order about 5+ minutes later. When the food came it was dropped off by a food runner. Everything here is a la carte, so you dont receive fries/chips with your burger. My bill for a burger with Just cheese and fries costed $17! I took a bite of the burger that I requested to be medium that was completely rare. I waited to ask my server to send it back, but he was nowhere to be found. I waited over 10 minutes and not one staff member walked past our table or was even in sight. We also witnessed the manager? Yelling in the middle of the establishment at a bartender for being late. Several tables were watching this encounter. While eating, 2 parties who had been seated left due to not being acknowledged by the server. Meanwhile the manager? Was tending his tables. We had finished our meal and put the plates at the edge of the table. We then proceeded to wait over 15 minutes before the manager took our dirty plates away. He then came back 5-10 minutes after and asked if we needed anything else. I said yes our checks please. When he came back he have us one check. We waited another 5+ minutes before we could tell him we wanted separate checks. My friends bill came to $11.13. She put $15 on the check presenter. He picked it up and took $4 out of his pocket and handed it back to her. We were baffled. We have never seen a server do this before especially seeing that we were both servers. This was absolutely a terrible experience."}
{"text":"If you are looking for food of a different type,  this is definitely the place for you.  The food I ordered was entirely not what I thought and it included onions,  even though it was not supposed to logically have onions. Though the staff was nice and friendly I was extremely unhappy with my food, as was my date."}
{"text":"Nice place, king Salmon burger very delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent food and delivery service, the fries are still crispy when delivered, one of my most desirable delivery experience in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"We've tried this restaurant multiple times....love the bar and we keep hoping that the food will get better.....but, it doesn't.  Veggie burger is too salty - salad greens were wilted and clearly old.  Burgers are just ok....left us feeling heavy and knowing that we ate a burger.  We will come back for the bar but we're finished hoping the food will be better."}
{"text":"We decided to try BRGR since we didn't want to drive to Burgatory. The service was good (Sarah, I think). The grilled cheese bites were yummy. The Bloody Mary was pretty good (very horseradish-ey, which I like). The burgers were just disappointing. Tasteless, dry burgers were not what we were hoping for from a place called BRGR. Make the trip to Burgatory if you want a fantastic burger."}
{"text":"BRGR is a great place to get drinks and comfort food with friends. The clientele and bartenders are friendly and chatty. If you want to watch a game, there are about 8 HDTV's all tuned to one of two sports channels. The burgers come in all shapes and sizes (beef, lamb, salmon, tuna, etc.) and the cocktails are very inventive (Miller Lite + Rhuby + Bitters = Genius!). The beer list is very respectable. My only gripe is with the milkshakes.  They are some serious sugary whisky-crack, and I'm just into whisky.

The downstairs has a leather-bound chair/couch and sports bar vibe that is kind of fun if you are having a night out with the peeps and want to eat some place that is not going to destroy your wallet (expect to spend ~$30 bucks per person). Most of the people who would watch a football game here are a little more on the yuppie than yinzer side, but hopefully that scene will improve. At present, it's less hipster than Kelly's but there is none of the MD-brofest that is endemic to Shadyside. The upstairs patio is nice in the summertime, but has stellar views of the now defunct Borders, AAA, and CVS East Liberty (i.e., its virtue is that you are eating outside). 

It is  EASY to meet up with people here after eating at Spoon. You can literally walk from one restaurant to the other, and the cocktails are arguably more creative on the cheaper side.  

On a final note, if you are stuck at Bakery Square due to your or someone else's poor planning and are not a teenage girl enthralled with the shabby-chic overpriced yardsale that is Anthropologie, it is probably the best place to spend a little downtime in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Taking its name into consideration, BRGR has surprisingly bad burgers.  I've been here twice, and both times I've left underwhelmed and disappointed.  I've noticed a trend with this place and Burgatory where there is a lot of talk about the fanciful and impressive burgers, but what I want with a burger is just delicious food.  Don't get me wrong-- I enjoy fussy burgers with lots of various toppings, but the actual beef has to good.

Both times I've order burgers here, I've asked for medium-rare, and every time it comes out well-done.  The fries the first time were delicious, but the second time I came here, they were lukewarm, over-salted, and dry as if they'd been sitting under a heat lamp for too long.

I think the two things that make BRGR a worthwhile trip are the alcoholic milkshakes and the rooftap terrace (only open in the Spring and Summer, I believe).  I doubt I'll ever get food here again, but if some friends want to relax under the sun/stars and get fat/drunk on some shakes, I'd suggest BRGR.  

Random sidenote - did BRGR really pay for the rights to play the Rolling Stones song \"Gimme Shelter\" on their website?  I'm skeptical."}
{"text":"One of top 5 burger spots. The bison burger is my go to. When your looking for a burger without having too choose all the different options this is the place. Happy hour is good for cocktails as well. Only downfall is mist get fries or sides separate from burger."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place because you can usually get a seat without too much of a wait and the burgers are good and not too pricey. They also use the No Wait app in case you want to put your name in ahead of time when you're on the way, which is a plus on a Friday night. Nice that you have options to shop while you wait too. Burger options are good and we like to build our own. Burgers do not come with any sides but the al la carte sides are definitely large enough for two or more people to share. My husband and I always split the cajun tator tots and can never finish them all. Drinks are definitely pricier. Even if you both just have one expect your bill to be a good $25 higher. But overall definitely a fan and will continue to come here often for quick bites."}
{"text":"Sydney was an amazing server. Her recommendations were very helpful and accurate. Constant attention to the table, asking how we were and filling up waters. Aside from the delicious food, I'd come back just for phenomenal service like the one Sydney offered!"}
{"text":"I've given BRGR enough recommendations. Working at a store on Walnut street I have sent a lot of customers out to their location. I typically have a good experience there. Normally I just go with my girlfriend and the experience is great. However today I went with a party of 6 to show how nice it is, how good the shakes are, and just how the comments about them being snobby are false. 

Well, today proved me wrong in every way. I went in and we waited at the bar for our party to all get there (that is normal). But when my party arrived, I went to the hostess and said our party was here and she said give me 5 minutes to get your table set up. I wait 5 minutes and walk upstairs to the open air roof. No table... No wait staff even expected us. 

While sitting there, we all ordered shakes and said no food right now. We got a look like, why are you even here? Then sitting close to the upstairs hostess, I hear her say to the downstairs staff; \"Make sure the people you send up are ordering food.\"  We ordered side orders, but I did not go there to eat. I went only for their shakes.

I know my friends and I spend more money drinking than eating. Especially when the shakes are $8 and the burgers are $12. 

We left shortly after hearing the comments from the staff because it was an environment we did not want to stay in."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite and beer. Great atmosphere. Service was good and everyone was friendly. Just got the pierogis but they were great."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently ate at BRGR during a trip to the Pittsburgh Arts Festival.  We thought it was great.  We were seated near the bar and the waitress immediately brought water to the table.  From that point, our service was acceptable but not great.  The decor is contemporary western which compliments the beef dependent menu.  The bathrooms were clean and attractive.  

Now, the food.  The food was great.  We ordered and split one of the adult milkshakes and it was amazing.  I now believe that no vanilla ice cream should be served without bourbon.  I had the button buster which was delicious and rich, my husband had the smokehouse bison which would be my choice for our next visit.  We shared an order of fries which were tasty.  

All in all, it was a very good experience.  Only 4 stars because our waitress was too busy socializing to give us the caliber of service I have come to expect with any restaurant, but especially for a restaurant with what appeared to be an abundance of wait staff for a relatively slimly populated dining room.  We would certainly return."}
{"text":"Kinda stumbled upon this place Saturday night before game day. Downtown was packed and couldn't get in anywhere without an hour wait. We only waited about 20 minutes for a table which made me nervous, but we loved our food! Everyone had an angus burger - they were cooked perfectly and were so unique with the different toppings. Nice selection of beers too.  Kids had the milkshakes - oh wow - to die for!!  If we are ever in Pittsburgh again we will be stopping in!!"}
{"text":"Their burgers are different, so if you want a traditional burger, you'll have to order off the menu.  Additionally, everything is a la carte, so the bill adds up quickly."}
{"text":"For all the hype about this place I was really expecting more. My husband and I went on a weeknight. Luckily there wasn't much of a wait. I've heard it can be up to 2 hours, but since it was 7:30pm on a Tuesday we were in the clear. 

The service was wonderful. Our waiter was extremely attentive and helpful when we asked questions about the menu. But the burgers and sides were just kind of okay. Which isn't bad. I think I was just expecting a blow-your-mind burger.

I ordered the Sante Fe Hippie, but substituted beef for the vegetarian patty...so I guess it was only kind of half a hippie. And it was a decent burger, don't get me wrong about that. If I had gotten it for like $6 at a burger shack I would have been really impressed, but for a gourmet burger restaurant I'd say it was just alright. 

The burgers at BRGR don't come with a side of chips or fries. But they have shareable sides you can order that are big enough for two people. We got tater-tots. It seemed like they were just the tater-tots you can get at the grocery store and make in the oven. It's nice there are a few different side options other than just fries though.

I'm happy we tried BRGR. But from now on when I want a gourmet burger, I'll always go to Burgatory."}
{"text":"We have been to BRGR about every two weeks for the last few months. Great for kids, great beer selection, and on par with Bubba Burger in Bridgeville but with a little better service and side choices."}
{"text":"I was torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars. The sante fe hippie burger was just okay, but the bison burger was absolutely delicious. The spiked shakes are also really good. THe restaurant is big, has TVs, and is a great location.

On one visit, it was great service, yet the other visit wasn't so good. I ordered a cocktail during HH which was good and ordered it again. The second time it was almost all orange juice. He then messed up on my receipt. Though, I gave it 4 stars because these could be mistakes anyone could make at any day or time. As long as I stay clear from this waiter, I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Food was good but service slow on a slow night. Waitress was talking to bartender most of the time and was not very attentive."}
{"text":"Wow. Their burgers are cooked perfectly. It was savory and tender and juicy and the topping were the right proportions and it was delicious. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I love BRGR in Shadyside as a fun and trendy options. It's feature menu is similar to Burgatory, but the food is better in my opinion! You can build any kind of burger you can dream of - but look closely. Those add-ons can really rack up your bill! I'm also a big fan of their Greek salad if you're looking for a lighter option, and of course, you top off your meal with a milkshake (alcoholic ones are delicious!) Just be hesitant that the bill can get expensive quickly! Great location and valet parking available."}
{"text":"The best way to describe BrGr is it's a young teenage boy trying to fit into his father's big boy pants. I have eaten at this place about five times now since it opened. Every time the experience has been inconstant. The burgers are good, but I've had better at places like Tessaro's. The service is questionable, particularly on the weekends, as you never know if the server will be attentive or not.

Also, I think their menu changes too often. Perhaps it's because they are trying to find the right menu mix. But it only adds to the inconsistency. For example, my friend had an amazing burger salad he told me I had to try. I came in the next day and it was already off the menu. Same thing with the sweet potato fries. One day they were there and the next they were not.

I had one of their specialty drinks at the bar. It was called \"Lemonade\" but it had vanilla vodka in it which overpowered the entire beverage. Nancy, the bartender, overheard me making a comment to my friend that the drink was not very good. She offered to fix it for me, which was a very nice gesture.

Much like a teenage boy, this burger bar is clumsy and awkward as it still tries to figure out its place in the new East Side dining scene. There is hope it will grow up and be the strapping young man we hope it will be. I want to like this place and hope it will become a neighborhood staple. It just needs time to figure things out."}
{"text":"Went to BRGR the other day with one other guest. We were seated upstairs on the rooftop deck, which was quite pleasant since it was a beautiful summer evening. Service was friendly and prompt. Burgers were good and were cooked as we ordered (medium and medium well).  I left satisfied and would return."}
{"text":"I finally ate at the restaurant. I was hoping for redemption. I was very disappointed. VERY. The fries were probably the highlight, and they weren't even that great. Not as good as Burgatory's fries. I got the Hippie Burger with a black bean and falafel burger. It was pretty much tasteless.  The sauce on it was tasteless and blah. I needed salt for my burger and I don't tend to salt any of my food. Even our server was not enthused about the food. If I could give it zero stars, I would. I wanted to LOVE this place, and I just won't be coming back..."}
{"text":"Was here a few months ago with my fiance for a quick bite.  Had to wait for a table so we sat at the bar.  Bartender was polite and helpful.  It was a cold night and we ended up sitting on the rooftop area that was being heated with propane heaters.  It was chilly as we sat next to the streetside in an open area but bearable.

I wasn't impressed with the burger that much. It was OK but nothing special.  For the price I was expecting something much better.  And there are no sides with your burger.  If you want fries expect to pay extra.  

Overall, it wasn't bad-i'd eat here again if someone wanted to treat or I wanted to just blow some money.  Pittsburgh has no shortage of burger/beer joints at better price points with better food."}
{"text":"I ate at BRGR for the first time this weekend. Although it was muggy outside we sat upstairs. With the ceiling fans going and a great view, I was glad we made that choice. For 7 o'clock on a Friday night it was pretty slow. We got seated right away and our waitress seemed almost bored, constantly checking on us which I guess is better than not. Now on to the food. We all had the summer shandy cocktail, which was citrus vodka, yuengling and lemonade and it was delish. For apps we had the chips and crack dip and also the fried grilled cheese. Both of which were delicious. We had to get a second order of the chips, the cheese dip is that good. We all had burgers which were also good. Was it OMG best burger I ever had in my life, no. But all in all, great service, great drinks and a good burger = a good time. Oh and they also have valet for $3 which is a deal because parking down there can be a nightmare!"}
{"text":"I've only been to BRGR one time, but I would totally eat here again if given the chance. It's a bit out of my way and parking can be tricky in this part of town, which is the only reason I haven't gone back. 

So, most importantly, the food. BRGR definitely has some fantastic options. I love their cheesy toasted grilled cheese bites and would so order these again. And the burgers! I'm seriously in love with their burgers. I read their menu and zeroed in on the fact that they have a Brie cheese 'shroom burger. I'm all about delicious, cheese-loaded 'shroom burgers - particularly big juicy ones ones that you can order local ales with. Plus, I went to dine here during the summer, so I had the chance to sit by the wide open floor-to-ceiling windows. I had a perfect dinner, and it was the perfect atmosphere for dinner.

Be careful if you choose this seating option, though; I went during the end of rush hour so it wasn't a big deal, but the music combined with car horns could easily have been pretty hard on the ears. Not to mention, near the end of my meal it began raining before anyone could shut those windows, which I'm sure could have negatively affected my meal if I'd arrived later in the evening and sat in the same place. It probably wouldn't hurt for the staff to double check weather forecasts before opening those enormous windows, especially on a busy night where guests can't exercise caution and ask to sit anywhere else.

Last note: looking at other reviews, I wonder if this place is hit or miss depending on the day you go, because my burger was perfect and my fries just excellent. I'll have to see what happens when I get the chance to eat here again!"}
{"text":"So far the best burger joint I've been to near Oakland area of Pittsburgh. The meat is always cooked the right way i want it to be, shakes are to die for (I don't like vanilla and my boyfriend got the vanilla milkshake-I loved it!!!) and of course the fries and onion rings as well are SO GOOD. If you just add on beer, the best burger joint you have right there! Definitely recommnd BRGR to anyone and the menu is not too long, not too short so i'ts perfect to just put in your order and chit chat w/ your friends as you drink your beer. I visit Pittsburgh about once a month for the weekend, and I've been to BRGR all times for the past 3 visits. It's just inevitable:)"}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of BRGR - while they're not my absolute favorite burger place in the 'Burgh they easily make my top five list. I actually prefer them over another similar local burger franchise since I find their portion sizes to be considerably more reasonable and their meals juicier and tastier overall. So when I heard that a BRGR was coming to my part of town I was thrilled. After giving them a couple months to work out of the growing pains that come with any business or restaurant opening at a new location, I made it a point to stop on in and check out the newest member of the BRGR family.

I came in on a Saturday so the place was, unsurprisingly, hopping. One thing I do want to note is that I noticed while playing with my phone after sitting that my No Wait app said there was no wait for general seating, which was not correct; I fortunately didn't have to wait since I was willing to sit at the bar. After looking over the familiar BRGR menu and ordering I could take in the look of the place. It's quirky, but in a good way I think; the lounge chairs, cow-pattern foot-rests, big screen TVs, wooden decor all kind of come together in what I guess is supposed to be a kind of modern Western look. 'Cause...beef equals cows equals Western, maybe? It definitely doesn't look terrible despite my teasing, but I admit that since they're located in a mall they don't have quite the same atmosphere as the stand-alone eastside joint.

Mall location or not, the food is exactly what I've come to expect from BRGR. I actually ordered a custom burger, which came out SUPER quickly (within 15 minutes of ordering) despite the full house. I also ordered a S'mores milkshake which was admittedly delayed - I had to ask about it after my burger came out - but it made it to my seat within a couple minutes after the mix-up had been discovered, so the delay wasn't a huge issue. The milkshake was just yummy - the ice cream itself was creamy and the drink was covered in marshmallows, complete with cracker bites and chocolate chips sprinkled in throughout the beverage. I enjoyed every sip of it! And my burger, while admittedly not the juiciest burger ever, was still very very good and cooked exactly as I'd ordered. I'd asked for fried egg, avocado, tomato-cucumber relish, pepper jack cheese, bacon and mushrooms, and it was an excellent blend - plus a few pieces of avocado and whatnot slipped off of the burger as I ate (which isn't something that happens often when I eat burgers or sandwiches and whatnot, since I'm a very neat eater), so I'd definitely say they didn't skimp on the toppings! My only additional comment on the burger would be that the pepper jack cheese really didn't have any kick to it like I'd hoped, so if you like more flavorful pepper jack like I do you may want to pass on it here.

Overall I was very pleased with my meal here, which for the most part had no issues and no delays despite the busy Saturday mall crowd. I will definitely keep this new location in mind the next time I want a burger and I just don't have it in me to leave the area and go elsewhere - plus I really do want to come back to enjoy some of my favorite BRGR drinks and appetizers!"}
{"text":"If you've been to one semi-pricey specialty burger joint you've pretty much been to most of them, and BRGR's no real exception. They do give you a pretty sizable helping of fresh cooked fries when you order them, and every ingredient on the burger is fresh. It's the kind of meal I don't think I'd typically pay $10-15 for, but I enjoyed it and didn't feel bad about it. Plus the staff here were all super cool and friendly. I can think of worse places to go get a gourmet burger and a drink or two."}
{"text":"I am a fan. The burger I had the double yoi with homemade chips was just amazing. I was expecting a good burger but I really liked this one a lot. The flavor was just amazing, meat was cooked perfectly and the service was so friendly. Ask for Becca, she did a great job with our party of 7 for lunch."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I don't really get the big idea. The black bean falafel burger is really dry and dense. I had such a hard time eating it. Their sweet potato fries are so crispy that they borderline hard and inedible. My partner had the BRGR burger and also said it was nothing to write home about. Really disappointing. On the other hand, the service is top notch and the servers and runners are really attentive."}
{"text":"This location is an insult to the BRGR brand.  The staff is brusque and short, with the exception of one of the four we interacted with.  The burger is made ahead of time completely.  I mean the cheese and the burger were at best warm.  The fries were warm but carelessly seasoned.  All this and the price was at least 50% higher than the BRGR a quarter mile away downtown.  Avoid at all costs folks, this location carries none of the BRGR fire."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Friday around 8 and faced a very crowded bar area & 40 minute wait. Enjoyed a Full Pint IPA and gf had a Blue Point Winter Ale. Good vibe to the place -young crowd and families. Seats are a little close to other diners. Dinner included Root Float, o rings w truffled Cheese Whiz - I know, who thinks of these crazy concoctions - which was good and crispy but needs a little larger onion. Had the Fire in the Hole burger med rare (very pink center) and it was really good. GF had the Button Buster w the short ribs and white cheddar but we could not locate any cheese - serious bummer. They do iphone paging system so you can check your progress! Overall nice experience. Ladies room was clean and big."}
{"text":"I went to Brgr for the first time a few days after it opened and have a mediocre burger and awful service.  I was really excited after reading reviews which implied that the service had been improved and that the menu has been changed.  I tried it again this past Friday night.  

First off...the positives:  1.  The service (at the tables) has ABSOLUTELY improved!  We had a party of 8 and had very attentive waiters.  The bartenders still need some improvement.  2.  The rooftop seating is really beautiful.  This place gets an A+ for atmosphere.  

Unfortunately, the negatives outweighed the positives:  
1.  The bartender was still disapointing.  He made several mistakes, and one resulted in me paying for a $7+ bottled beer instead of the half off draft that I actually ordered.  He also forgot that my friend had already paid her tab and wanted her to pay twice.  2.  The menu is, in my opinion, way too small.  They only have a few shake combinations, which compared to Burgatory is very disapointing.  Also, they do not allow any substitutions on their burgers.  PLEASE PLEASE add a make your own burger!  3.  I have not had a beef burger at Brgr. I think if you have a turkey burger or a salmon burger on your menu, it should be high quality, just like your beef burgers.  If these nonbeef burgers are going to be afterthoughts, please don't have them as choices!  I had the turkey burger this time, and the burger was much smaller than the bun, with the toppings (avacado, mayo, sprouts) completely overwhelming the flavor of the turkey, which after I took everything off of it was actually decent.

Overall, I think that the food is a bit overpriced, and that the quality of the non-beef burgers are much lower than other burger joints in the area.  Harris Grill and Burgatory have much better turkey burgers, and Burgatory completely surpasses Brgr when it comes to choices.  I probably will not try Brgr again, but if I do, I will make sure to stick with beef."}
{"text":"BRGR's website claims to employee an executive chef. That's interesting. An executive chef for a place that serves burgers and fried things? Why? What on earth does he do there? Time the fries? Discern if every burger is indeed medium and not medium rare? By my estimation it is absolutely ridiculous. BRGR is a burger place. The burgers aren't very special. They are burgers. Yes, you may be able to get Gouda or perhaps Gorgonzola. In the end it is a burger. Despite the executive chef possibly being a real thing, which again is an absolutely ridiculous notion, the burgers are just, well, pretty normal and certainly not special. They need to upgrade the fried things. They are not good. The fry on them is just kind of soggy.

What is special is the particular terribleness of the service and ambiance. Notably at the bar and with the selection of totally inappropriate whiny metal music dabbled with teeny bop girl scream pop. Think Katie Perry B-Sides. Think Everlast. Think some 17 year old screaming about dying young on her highly engineered track daddy payed for.  I look around the place and almost everyone is over 30. A majority of patrons over 50. Imagine the bartender, while forgetting you are there while you wait with a twenty on the table and empty glasses singing along, self assured with every word as the minutes drawl by. Sure, perhaps it was a one off night. It was Saturday at about 6pm. There were only 4 people behind the bar milling about. Perhaps, the didn't see us or anyone of the silver haired guests as they spoke among themselves, audibly enough for us all to hear, about being perfectly drunk on that one night, at that one party, that one time. Perhaps, as they sang along to the terrible, annoying, loud, inappropriately selected songs, about dying young, they were so touched with internal empathetic emotion they were transported away, far away from the bar at BRGR in East Liberty on a Saturday night in November at 6pm, to a dark room, where they fantasize about people missing them if they die young. 

Them:
\" Ohhhhh....My....Gawdaaaaaah!!!!!!!! I was like...just perfectly drunk. Like not too drunk to the point where you're like, you know, all sloppy. Just perfectly drunk and stuff.\"

Us...after 10 minutes with empty glasses:
\"May we please get a check please.\"

BRGR look around and see whats going on in your restaurant. You are supposed to cater to your guests and not your own terrible taste."}
{"text":"Took my daughter here for a bite to eat while in Pittsburgh. Awesome Gluten Free chicken sandwich! Great atmosphere. Maybe they will make their fries in a separate fryer so I can enjoy gf fries next time!"}
{"text":"My wife suggested that we have lunch here today....my first time at BRGR. I had the Cease and Desist burger with carmelized onions, American cheese and 1000 Island dressing with a side of onion rings. This is the best burger and the best rings I can remember ever having...bar none! 

The burger, cooked medium well, was perfectly cooked and combined with the toppings delivered a mouth pleasing experience! The burger was also sized right....not oversized to make up for inferior meat. The onion rings had a homemade crispy coating with a real circle of snappy onion. 

The restaurant was comfortable, not overly noisy(except for the chatty women at the next table) with two flat screens in my line of vision. 

Would it be wrong to have lunch and dinner here today? Doesn't matter....I'll be back often!"}
{"text":"Terrible service!  We sat at the bar and the had the worst service ever!  There were 2 bartenders and both lack any idea how to provide customer service.... they both hid at the corner of the bar and continually focused on the tickets coming in from tables and hid with their backs turned to guests.  I had to get up and ask for a food menu, and then again for silverware.  When we needed  we beers is had to physically wave my arms in the air for 45 secs to get their attention.

Used to love this bar.... disappointing.  We will be at the yard going forward!"}
{"text":"Burgers are great.  Great house chili.  Service sucks though.  They need to get a handle on their front house team and get a decent front-house manager in there before that situation tanks what is potentially a great idea.  We waited 15 minutes for water...another 15 for actual drinks.  We watched the wait staff chilling by the bar and shooting the shit.   Yep.  I worked in the industry for a loooong time and know what fails a place.   I hope the owners are paying attention.  You've got a good product and a nice physical space, but the front-house team needs something: encouragement, leadership, a system, all-of-the-above.  I felt bad tipping 12%, but it was warranted and probably too high.  

Note to owners:  PLEASE do NOT blame the front house staff.  Blame only yourselves and fix it with compassion.  I would like to see you succeed.   And if you, the owner, are also the chef...try not to be a dick.  Okay?"}
{"text":"Foie Gras burger was Da Bomb!

It took me a while to come and try this place because I saw that the rating on Yelp was only a 3.5 star. But after finally deciding to give this place a try, I am surprised that the place only receives a 3.5!! Granted this may not be THE BEST burger place I've ever had,  but so far it has impressed me for the two times that I did come here.

If you're willing to dish out an addition 13 dollars, definitely try their Foie Gras burger. There is no way that someone would not give this place a 4 star after trying that! Once in a while, that additional $13 dollar is totally worth it. But even if you're not in the mood to pay that much for a burger, there are still plenty of other options. I love mushrooms, so I tried their Shroom burger, which in my opinion, was also very good!! Love the mustard aioli they add, gives the burger a burst in your mouth feel when you eat it. My fiance tried their Turkey burger with lettuce wrap, and it's pretty delicious for people that's going for the healthy option. Of course, go with the REAL burgers if you're going for the full flavor. 

BRGR also offers the some pretty interesting drinks that you won't find at many other places - the Beertails. My fiance loves trying their different Beertails, where a beer is paired with a shot of hard liquor and a very unique chaser. I think they offer some pretty interesting combinations that's worth a try. 

Aside from Winghart, this is probably my favorite burger joint in the Pittsburgh region - I would chose here over both Stack'd and Burgatory when I am feeling for a good gourmet burger."}
{"text":"First off, I'm going to get this off my chest...I don't eat red meat or seafood and I'm allergic to mushrooms.  This left me with three burger options as there are no substitutions (as the menu ominously states).  And for that, I don't know if I want to applaud them for sticking true to the beef roots of burgers or think of it as poor business planning in a post-\"Fast Food Nation\" world.  Either way, I've went with some good ole 'Merican red-meat-eaters every time, who attested to the excellent in the beef patties.

So I've tried three burgers personally (in ascending order of worse to best):
-The Tree Hugger (falafel burger): Dry, tasteless, just about the worse falafel I've ever had.
-The Locavore (lamb burger):  I think lamb is just not for me.  I don't blame the burger so much in this case since everyone else I was with who tried it, loved it. The relish was quite good and the mint was a nice touch.
-California Lovin' (turkey burger): Overall, excellent.  I could have done with less alfalfa and more avocado though.

The bread is uninspired, which is my main general burger compliant.  The pickle also made it a little soggy.  But put better buns around those burgers, and I will upgrade by a star in a second.

The appetizers were all great and large enough to share amongst 2-4 people.  I strongly recommend the BRGR fries and the onion rings.

The milkshakes would earn a 5-star review alone if this were a milkshake shop, but it's called BRGR so no go.  Here's the run-down: all excellent, boozy or not!  The Bourbon Cherry float was STRONG on first sip, since until the ice cream melted a bit not a whole lot of cherry soda could fit into the glass.  Luckily, the waitress left the soda bottle so I could fill as I went.  The Salty Caramel was also incredible, but the prize for best milkshake has to go for the White-Russian-In-Shake-Form called The Dude Abides.  It's not on the menu anymore (for shame!), but the staff is pretty cool about making it anyway if you ask.

The decor was a little trying-too-hard-to-be-trendy.  It took about 5 minutes to seat a party of four at 7pm on a Saturday, but it was taking about 40+ minutes for groups that size as we were leaving around 8:30pm."}
{"text":"Average and slipping. The burgers lack flavor, and despite the 'local' appeal (local is overdone and becoming a tag line that skeptics are teeing off on- yep, local is great and kudos to those who do it well). BRGR/ sorry, you food was once great. It's now average at best. The burgers were dry and below average. The fries were average. The service was good which brings the overall visit to average."}
{"text":"I've been twice, underwhelmed both times by both service (inconsistent and not particularly friendly) and the burgers (fine, but ...). I see lots of other raves, so maybe just not a good match for me."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat here for awhile now and finally got the chance to. My experience went from really good to not good at all. My friends and I had a really enthusiastic and nice server. We all ordered milkshakes and got a round of fried pickles. All which were really good. I've had better fried pickles, since their batter was super heavy and made for chicken, but they were still good. 

We ordered our food and we waited FOREVER for it. 3 other tables that got there after us were getting their food before us. Finally when the food came out, my burger was COLD. I'm not joking, it had no heat. It was obvious that it was sitting out the whole time we were waiting. I'm guessing our waitress either forgot or she didn't put all of our orders in. So I sent the burger back, the manager came out with the new one, didn't even say they were sorry or that they would comp the burger, nothing. She just said \"here you go, how's everyone else's? Okay good\" and walked away. The new burger also tasted a bit raw, too, but I didn't have the time or energy to say anything else. 

The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because the milkshakes are great and so are the fries and I liked the decor. But I am definitely not going back. I would choose Burgatory any day over this place."}
{"text":"First time at this place and really just looking for something convenient to Motor Square. And that may be the best feature of brgr. Well, no, the fries were very good, order without the cheese and herbs and they are fine. The Mocha milkshake was apparently very satifying to my partner as well. The brgr was not so good, no where near competing with Tessaro's. The meat was more or less tasteless. the bun chewy and tasteless. brgr this, I thought, and the first time will also be the last."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this place. They have great burgers and hard milk shakes. The prices are pretty good. They have roof top seating. They can get really crowded."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been interested in trying BRGR since it was recommended by a friend. We were unable to wait over 45 minutes last time we came to the Galleria during the Holidays, but this time we came on a Tuesday night after a movie and the place was nearly empty. We immediately got a booth on the wall, the host was friendly and the place was clean. So far so good. Our server (Erin) greeted us pretty quickly and we ordered the fried pickle appetizer, a margarita and an IPA from the extensive selection of beer. The margarita was ok, but my husband enjoyed the beer. We ordered the BRGR burger with the dry aged beef, the Glazed and Confused meatloaf burger, and an order of fries to share.

The fried pickles were pickle spears, not chips, which was disappointing. I wish I had known, because I probably would have passed on them. They were a little greasy for my taste, and we didn't finish them (this never happens). 

Our server came and asked my husband if he wanted another beer and he started to say yes. She took off and ordered him a second IPA without asking if he wanted the same beer as before or if he wanted a different beer. He was looking at the beer list and wanted a different beer, but it was too late. I wanted another drink, too. But I just waited until she returned and ordered it. She seemed in a hurry and distracted. I ordered the pomegranate martini and it was very good.

Our food came. My husband's burger was cooked well, and he said it was good. My sandwich was also good. Very messy, but tasty meatloaf wrapped in bacon, with bbq sauce and potato salad and cheese. Way too big to eat the whole thing. I took half of it home and barely touched the fries. The fries were good, plenty for two people. We also took them home. We did not have any of the sauces on our table mentioned by previous posters, but they sound good. It looked like the staff was closing down early and leaving. At one point a man was standing in the middle of the restaurant with a rolling dumpster full of garbage. Hours before closing! Not sure about management of this place....

The food was good, but not great by any means. The reason I am giving 3 stars as opposed to 4 is because we were rushed through our dinner, and felt as though our server couldn't wait to leave. She didn't ask if we wanted dessert or anything, just closed out our check. We have young kids and solo date nights are rare for us, so we really didn't feel like being rushed.The restaurant was open for two more hours, so we just waited for our food and continued our date until we were ready to leave."}
{"text":"Mahi wowie & the bison burger was exceptionally delicious and well made. Fries were surprisingly good (skinny and crunchy) with parm cheese and herbs. However, fries sold separately and not paired with a burger purchase is a crime- so expect to pay a good amount here, as craft beers are close to $10 as well. It would be a sold 5 star otherwise."}
{"text":"Came in after a long day of work to watch the playoff basketball games at the bar with my boyfriend.  The restaurant is well decorated, and the food is good enough.  My burger came out at the desired temperature and protein-style like I like (can't take the In-N-Out away from me).  With that said, I do think that the food was overpriced for what we got, nothing incredibly special in my opinion.  With regards to the service, I will say our bartender/server was very attentive and pleasant, and very helpful with the selection of our beer.  However, when we first entered the restaurant, we were not acknowledged or welcomed, and upon leaving the restaurant, we were treated the same way.  They just stared at us.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good enough, just not a well-rounded experience."}
{"text":"There are a lot of burger joints in Pittsburgh, and BRGR is one of the better ones. Maybe not as good as burgatory in the waterfront, but pretty darn good. 
I've never heard a complaint about a burger there and every single shake, spiked or otherwise, has been fabulous. Service is pretty good and even though there is often times a wait, you can have the hosts text you when your table is ready.
I've only had one issue worth mentioning:
I usually get the veggie burger, which is awesome, but recently tried the mahi mahi and shrimp burger. I expressed my concerns about the possible texture issues, but was encouraged by a table mate to try a different burger. I wish I could say I was wrong cause it looked so delicious, but it was the wrong texture. I'd give it 2 stars.
Besides the chewy fish sandwich, everything else is worth trying."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. What else can they be. But they have a nice selection of very creative burgers. I had the Thai peanut burger medium. And it was awesome. Perfectly cooked and loaded with flavor.  Niece had shroom burger and loved it. Loads of mushrooms and cooked perfectly.  Had the truffle fries with cheese which they slathered on.  Would have prefered on the side but oh well and the coleslaw was perfectly matched the apple slaw raisins  worth every penny. 
Be prepared to drop a few extra duckets. But I think worth it."}
{"text":"Good (but greasy) burgers, decent prices for the serving size."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Sat on the deck/patio.  Server was attentive.  Pad Thai Burger was ok; unfortunately there just wasn't enough flavor which I thought was odd considering there is a sweet chili & peanut sauce on it.  Husband's was much tastier as he had the Double Yoi w/ a \"lettuce bun\". The spiked milk shake was nothing to write home about.  Couldn't even taste the alcohol and they're not that thick.  I personally like Burgatory's shakes better."}
{"text":"Chachos!!! I'm in love with you!!! Huuuuge size. I just moved to PA and this is my go to restaurant, better and fastest service, than othet places, and the quality of the burguer is excelente, cooked to perfection. 
Our server dont remember his name young kid was very friendly, and took good care of us. 
Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Delicious, freshly ground, ammonia-free, perfectly cooked burger,  fast service, tasty fries and easy parking.  And if you're a vegetarian, they'll be happy to provide you with as many napkins you can eat.  Maybe some cardboard, too!"}
{"text":"Nice place, crowded on a Saturday night. We just came and had drinks before our dinner at the yard. Bar was almost full, two free seats for us, perfect! The bartenders were nice but nothing crazy. We both got ipas. They had three to pick from and those are the only types of beer I really ever order when we are out. I got the terrapin luau krunkles. I had never tried it yet, it was delicious!! I guessed it had passion fruit in it and was right! Yum! Love passion fruit ipa. Will be back for drinks."}
{"text":"This is not my favorite burger place in Pittsburgh. It's probably because the last time I was here, I asked for medium plus on my burger, and our waitress looked at me like I was crazy and told me that was not possible. Ok? How is that not possible? I understand that there is no button option on the ordering screen for \"medium plus,\" but I'm pretty sure it's possible to jot a note to the chef. Anyway, needless to say, the meal started off on a sour note for me.

I've been back two times since, and on both occasions, my burgers were dry. I tried the salmon burger once as well as the hippie burger on the other occasion. The burgers were fine, and the fries are actually very delicious, as well as the milkshakes, but I prefer Burgatory. Hands down."}
{"text":"Ordered the Avg Joe, fries and a Strawberry shake 15 mins before closing and you never would have known. Treated like we were the first customers of the day. Food was excellent and so was the shake. This was also very close to the hotel, which was a bonus!!"}
{"text":"The burgers were amazing, the angus beef tasted to perfection, the bun was great. We also tried their mac and cheese it was so tasty. Their fries were so good and the amount fits for two. The place is great i highly reccomend it to anyone to go there and just enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"This place took over the footprint of the Japanese restaurant on the 2nd floor of the Galleria right across from Anthropologie.

Upon checking in there was 2 listings for BRGR which are duplicates so I had checked them both out.  It was already around 2pm and we didn't have lunch yet so I thought we'd give it a try.

They have a pretty good beer menu.  I was more concerned about the drafts on the beer card which had drafts on one side and bottled on the other.  While it wasn't feasible to do so I ended up getting the \"crate\" which is 4 x 5oz draft beers of your choice for 12 dollars.  So I knew that 20oz for 12 bucks is a bad deal but I wanted to try all 4 IPAs they had so this was the easiest way without having 4 pints.  The beers were all distinctly different but good.  I think my favorite was the one from Massachusetts (#1).

The place honestly reminds me a lot of how Burgatory does their menu with the custom choices.  

I went with a bison on a brioche with blue cheese, bacon and onion straws.  I had also ordered the fries which by default come with Parmesan cheese and herbs.  

My wife had decided on macaroni and cheese and it came with a hot dog.  

My burger was great.  The meat while it didn't necessarily look to be done medium wasn't overdone.  The blue was real blue not the kind of blue that is used in dressing or served with wings.  The onion straws were crispy and fresh, not cold and dry.  The burger itself was a near 5 or as close as I can give it.  I'd say safely it was better than the similar burger I had ordered last time I went to Burgatory.  The fries were good too.  While there was an option for gravy or chili and cheese I didn't want that.  I'd go that route if this wasn't a gourmet burger I think but I didn't really want anything to take away from the burger itself.

Where they fell off was what my wife had ordered.  I told her next time we go to a burger place, order a burger and not what they do not specialize in.  Her mac and cheese with a hot dog was a sufficient sized serving.  The dog was huge and really thick.  The thing is it was either boiled or steamed and it was sort of bland.  The mac and cheese wasn't a mac and cheese.  It was scoobi do or swirl type pasta except it was with a chili mixed in so the easiest way to describe it is that it was more like a Hamburger Helper.  Not a cheesy mac and cheese but rather a pasta mixed with chili.  

Regardless of the macaroni and cheese fail the burger balanced it out and so I will give this place a 4* because I didn't think it was just OK but rather better than that.  If I had to choose between BRGR and Burgatory that would be tough.  I haven't had enough of the menu of each to say which I prefer more but with what I had today at BRGR compared to what I had at Burgatory last time I think BRGR wins this round."}
{"text":"I ate the Jalapeno burger with a veggie pattie substitution.  Tasted solid, but I've had better.  Definitely try the fried pickles as they're well worth it.  Milkshakes are also a must, spiked or not-spiked.  This place also lost a star with me because it's a tad bit on the pricey side for what you get.  Overall though, solid."}
{"text":"Spiked Shakes and Kobe Burgers!!!!???? Are you kidding meee??

BRGR has, in my opinion, come across something totally mind-bending in their spiked milk shakes, and they are AWESOME. It's like being an adulterated child. 

Remember all those times you went through the dairy queen drive thru and wish your blizzard had alcohol in it. Well, BRGR has done it my friend, fear no more.

Their Kobe burger was amazing, as well. I think I inhaled that piece of delicious meat and bread in less than 3 minutes if I'm not mistaken. And their fries are crispy and perfectly seasoned with garlic and salt?? 

I love BRGR and will come back with some meat and shake lovers and totally blow their minds."}
{"text":"Went for my first try on a Sunday night. Sign is a bit hard to see, even right underneath it. It's he dark blue color, methinks. Two people, seated immediately. Nice and cozy with various comfy couches and tables and chairs. We had a bench seat/chair combo. Almost immediately we were asked if we'd mind moving to another table since a large party would be arriving shortly. No pressure at all - we were told we could stay put if we wanted. I had no issues with moving, and we soon relocated to a barstool-type table. It took a bit of time for a waitress to come over, but she finally arrived to take our drink order. Nice selection of draft and bottled beers, and good to see Natrona Bottling pops offered. I ordered a Shroomz Burger (forest mushrooms, caramelized onions, brie and mustard aoili) and my friend had a Fire in The Hole (guacamole, jalapeños, pepper jack and chipotle mayo). My burger was one of the tenderest I've had - almost too much so, like biting into cream cheese - but had decent flavor. My friend seemed to like his too. The only real issue I had was with the side of onion rings. They would have been wonderful - nice and crispy, tender onion circles, good-sized order - if it had retained at least a degree of warmth. My bad for not sending back. The fries were pretty much the same. When the bill came, the waitress told us our drinks were on the house for the inconvenience of having to move. That's class!

Overall, don't think there's anything in particular that would draw me back for super expensive burgers, but I wouldn't caution anyone to stay away. Just make sure to ask for your sides to be hot."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service was abysmal.  Both the bartender and our food server seemed to be on drugs.  To the point where they seemed to have no idea where they were, what they were doing, or that they had customers to tend to."}
{"text":"Came around noon with three other friends on a Saturday.  Guess we beat the rush because we were seated right away.  The service is nice when the waitress is at your table, but for a place that wasn't so busy, I'd say it was a little spotty.  What was exceptional, however, was that when we ordered our Salted Caramel (spiked with Bourbon) shake and said we'd share it, the waitress automatically brought it out in two glasses, which was thoughtful. 

In terms of the burgers though...My friend and I got a Shrooms  (mushrooms, brie, caramelized onion) burger and a Double Yoi (pastrami, egg, swiss cheese, slaw) to share.  The burgers are super oily and unfortunately, the beef patties seemed so sadly underseasoned.  It was so so so underseasoned that the burger probably would've been just as good without the patties.  Sad.  The Shrooms came out on top though- the Double Yoi ended up being really heavy, even with the slaw.  I liked the ideas behind the burgers, but felt that the execution wasn't so great. 

The fries are pretty bomb though, so if you come, get some for the table to share."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT.
Better the Burgatory, in my opinion.

Here's the story:
- The burgers are just delicious.
- The fries are great.
- There's decent service.
- What more could I want?

My burger was properly cooked (medium really did have a bit of pink in the center, just like I wanted).  And it showed up hot and juicy (listening, Burgatory?).

This locations has lots of TVs, and the Steelers game was on.  They have the volume set where I could just hear the game, without the sound being overbearing.  (I prefer this to dining in a disco, but then I'm old and cranky...).

Go here.  Tell us what YOU think."}
{"text":"With so many fancy burger places around town, it can be hard to make your mark.  I debated between a 3 or 4 star review but when I consider the fact that I've been back for more on more than two occasions, I had to go higher with my rating.

I can't really hate a place that has tater tots and the Cajun Tater Tots at BRGR are well seasoned and very crispy.  I like homemade chips and I've had their crack dip.  It's good, but I don't get the hype.  I've haven't yet tried any of the spiked shakes.  When I do a burger and shake, I usually go with boring vanilla.  

I have enjoyed the Average Joe, Cease and Desist, Fire in the Hole and Button Buster.  Each burger is tasty and exciting in its own way.  The Average Joe is a good way to go at BRGR if you're looking to start simple.  Fire in the Hole has all your hotter ingredients (pepper jack cheese, jalepenos, sriracha sauce).  Cease and Desist is a good combination that's not too filling (cheese, caramelized onions and thousand island dressing) while the Button Buster is stacked high with short ribs, cheese and crispy onions.  I might have considered that 5th star if the burgers were cooked consistently.  My usual request is medium and I've had a few burgers more medium well or well done.  While I've only gone with their beef burgers, they do offer seafood, poultry and veggie burger creations as well.  

BRGR occupies an open and inviting space in East Liberty.  Great place for some people watching while you enjoy a burger and fries."}
{"text":"Well, I'm not a big fan. 

The food is decent, nothing wrong with it. It's just not special and does not justify the price point at all. 

I'd rather go to Houlihan's (also in this mall), where I can get a great burger that comes with fries, get better service, and actually save a few dollars. 

I'm not usually so cost-sensitive, but somehow, this whole experience just does not come close to justifying the price, especially for a family of five. 

No need to come back."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with their Buffalo Burger at all.  The service at our table was so/so, however, at the bar, they were pretty efficient and friendly.  I may be back for drinks, but not for food."}
{"text":"Ok. The burger is good. Some of the burgers are made with prime beef. But I think they could taste better if they had a wood fire grill. Shakes are like mixed concrete... and I mean that in a good way!!!

I'll go back."}
{"text":"Great shakes, great burgers and even better fries. The truffle cheese whiz is mind blowing."}
{"text":"I've stopped at this place a few times in my day but never really went out of my way for it. Today celebrating a coworkers birthday we decided to go since he love burgers. Today I decided I'd order a chicken sandwich from the build your own sandwich section. The sandwich came and I just say it looked delicious and I was proud of my creation. I pick it up, take a bite and I feel something strange in my mouth. I feel it on my right side and pulled this strange thing out, I realized I had bitten into a large rubber band. I immediately called the waiter over and showed him what was in my sandwich. Took it away instantly and had a new one made for me. By that time I had lost my appetite as did everyone else as the table. I will say they handled it well and professionally as I did not have to pay for my meal but still this was unacceptable. I highly doubt I will ever return."}
{"text":"I've tried this place once, and did not have a good experience.

BRGR bills itself as, \"Pittsburgh's first gourmet burger bar\".  Well, first of all, you might argue that Tessaro's, BRGR's competition located in an adjacent neighborhood, is Pittsburgh first \"gourmet\" (I hate that term, so overused) burger joint - predating BRGR by a couple of decades.  Secondly, for a restaurant that bills itself as a \"first\", you might wonder why they chose a non-novel name - the very same abbreviation is used as the name of several \"high-end\" burger restaurants in NYC, Kansas, and Texas.  

So let's talk about the \"gourmet\" burgers served at BRGR.  I don't really understand why they describe their burgers as \"gourmet\", as nothing is noteworthy about the meat used to make their burgers.  In every other \"gourmet\" burger restaurant that I've been to in other cities, I noticed that the restaurant had gone to great lengths to describe the locally-raised, grass-fed beef that went into their freshly-ground burgers.  BRGR never mentions the source, feed, or freshness of its burger meat.  

Upon tasting the burger, you quickly understand why - the burger is made from everyday commercially-raised meat.  It doesn't taste like anything particularly special.  It's a reasonably good burger - just nothing special.  It isn't anywhere near as good as Tessaro's - which is about the same price (for the burger alone, more to continue).

My girlfriend and I ordered both ordinary potato fries and sweet potato fries with our burgers.  The sweet potato fries were inedible - limp, wet, and oil-laden.  A single fry, lifted by two fingertips at its end, would double back on itself under its own weight.  We told the server that they were inedible and sent them back uneaten.  The potato fries were edible, just not very good - they were soft, undercooked (a soft yellow, without any crust that you expect in a good fry) and disappointing.  A \"gourmet\" burger joint ought to be able to serve a proper french fry: par-fried first at a lower temperature to first cook the interior creating big pillowy granules of fluffy starch, then flash-fried to order at a high temperature, properly caramelizing the exterior leaving the fry with a delicious tasty crust.  This isn't hard folks - I can do it in my own kitchen - why can't a self-professed \"gourmet\" restaurant do it in a professional kitchen?

The service during our visit was awful.  I was unfamiliar with a beer on the draft list and asked what type of beer it was.  Our server said, \"I don't know\" and stared at me.  I asked her to find out.  When she returned, I was told, \"It's a kind of a dark-type of a beer\".  Yikes.  Our server then proceeded to bring the wrong beer - and told us, \"I'm sorry, I was talking to my friends and forgot which beer you ordered\".  Yikes.  She also didn't deduct the inedible sweet potato fries from the order, until we reminded her.  All in all, she was a human conveyor belt - without knowledge, charm, or any detectable interest in her work.  It was way below par.

The atmosphere isn't to my taste - it has the look and feel of a high-end sports bar, with plasma TVs blaring sports entertainment from virtually every wall/corner.  There are a few plush-looking leather couches, likely remnants from the space's past life as a high-end cocktail bar, but I think you're paying for them.

Meaning, the prices are too high.  The burgers themselves seem reasonable ($6-$13, average over $8.50) - until you see that they do not come with any sides, which cost extra ($4 for fries, $5 for onion rings).  Draft beer is expensive - over half of the draft selections were in the $6.5 to $8.5 range for a pint of beer!  Dinner for two (two burgers, two sides, four beers) was over $57 - before a $4 fry was removed from the tab.  

All in all BRGR simply isn't worth the price.  If you want a far better burger, for a far better value, you're far better off going two miles away to Tessaro's."}
{"text":"from its name, \"BRGR bar\" sounds like a bar/lounge that sells specialty burgers. from the way BRGR treats its customers, it's a snobby expensive restaurant that turns away paying customers for no good reason.

first time i went there, i came with a group of 7 people for dinner and drinks. we waited for about 30 or 45 minutes patiently waiting for our table (as other smaller groups got sat). then we saw 2 tables open up right next to each other and we asked if they could put them together.  they said NO, but couldn't give us a good reason why (they actually said they just couldn't move the tables). there was no one behind us in line. the only tables that could accomodate us were still eating and clearly wouldn't open up for awhile. the two adjacent smaller tables just sat empty for 10-15 minutes when finally, we got fed up and argued with them until they realized they had NO good reason for why they couldn't put the tables together and finally sat us.  it seemed like they initially didn't want to do it b/c they are too \"good\" to move tables around to accomodate patrons.

the last time i went to BRGR, i tried to go there for drinks at around 9:30pm.  the restaurant area was mostly empty, 5-6 tables were open downstairs and who knows how many open on the patio.  no one was waiting in line.  we had a group of 4, but they refused to sit us because we only wanted drinks...they said we could sit at the bar (all the bar stools were taken). i said i \"might\" get an appetizer, but they still wouldnt sit us. we asked when we could get a table for drinks, they said around 11:30 or 12am.  two other larger groups came in at the same time, wanting to just sit and drink, and they wouldn't sit them b/c they weren't ordering food.  those groups left.  my group left and went down the road to mad mex (funny thing is, i actually ended up ordering food).  

anyways, management needs to realize that they are supposed to be the more casual counterpart of Spoon. probably never going back.

for the other stuff: 
-waitstaff service is good.
-shakes are good.
-the burgers are ehhhh and overpriced."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great burgers, fun variety, hip atmosphere - a great place for any occasion. I love their terrace upstairs, especially in summer sunset hours. BRGR really is a very good place that would survive competition in any foodie-oriented city."}
{"text":"I ordered the Fire in the Hole and my friends and I shared an order of fries with the cheese whiz.  Let me tell you my burger was made perfectly, the bun was soft and fresh and the burger was hot but not soo  spicy that you couldn't eat it because the gaucamole and green peppers masked some of the spicy.  It was the perfect blend to make the perfect burger.  The cheese sauce was so thick and delightful!  We also had Sangria's and they were amazing.  If you are looking for a great spin on a burger this is the perfect place to go.  The prices were also very good, I was pleasantly surprised.  The service however was a little less to be desired, she was very nice but we barely seen her.  It was a good thing we didn't really need any service since the food was soo amazing!!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner late last night with my boyfriend. I got the Maui wowi burger which surpassed my expectations. It was a mahi and shrimp party which I expected to be like salmon burgers typically are but was suprised when I got it. It was like a crab cake. Large chunks of fish and shrimp. So good. My boyfriend said his burger was also really good his was beef. We also got some awesome fried pickles and sweet potato fries. Both came with really good sauces. The staff was also really nice and everything came out really quickly. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Much tastier this time. 

Had the button buster burger and it was just enough. Shared some Cajun tots and they were okay. I'm interested to try their other potato products. 

Milkshake was much better than past visits. Chocolate chip cookie dough was on the top, a generous dollop. The shake itself was smooth so it goes fast :(. Texture is a little runnier than burgatory. 

Plenty of non-meat options so your vegetarian friends can come too."}
{"text":"If I had given this place a rating before they changed the menu, I would have given this place a 5 (not sure why I gave it such a low rating from before as the burger patties here have always been solid/one of my favorite no-nonsense burger patties in terms of quality). Not that the newer menu isn't better ... there is a lot more variety on it in terms of the kind of burgers you can get and they added some flair to the appetizer menu. The one thing that really made this place stand out was the fact that they used to have half-off on the Average Joe burger after 10 PM. $4 for a premium burger that is customizable fixings for $1 each is simply such a steal ... that just doesn't exist anymore. The new menu is nice though ... appetizers are good and them milkshakes are always nice to have."}
{"text":"Nice ambience, casual, tasty, and good value. 

the food is good for its price, but if it were a dollar more, would perhaps be not worth it. the burgers are inventive and cooked to perfection, but not a tessaro's burger surely. 

the beer selection would be enhanced by weekly changes or some kind of gimic to draw crowds. 

service was untrained and aloof. 

the \"truffle parmesan cheese fries\" were such a lie. melted \"nacho\" cheese sauce with barely any truffle oil and mozzarella cheese grated on top; you cannot fool me. just get some parmesan and some truffle oil and stop fooling with this cheese whiz business. 

the natrona bottling company sodas were a throw back and nice gesture, but needless to say, I will wait for a tessaros burger. 

go for the value."}
{"text":"Have the button Buster medium cooked with fries. Great burger, juicy and flavorful (I added a little burger sauce on the table) . Fries were typical. Had a great server and ambience was quiet when I visited. 

I would try Burgertory before coming back but it doesn't seem like this place had a big selection in terms of burgers. 

Kind of overpriced in my opinion."}
{"text":"Wanting to try the new place, we went around noon on a Sunday, place was less than half full, so no waiting.  We ordered and our burgers came surprisingly quickly.  You would think they would be piping hot.  But, no, they were just warm.  Had they been pre-cooked?  It was curious.  We ordered the Cajun tots and an order of fries.  The burgers were pretty tasteless, not juicy, which only added to our thoughts that they may have been pre-cooked.  Fries were nothing special and the tots on top had a sprinkling of spices, not enough to earn the Cajun label and very little spice flavor other than the ones on top.  Personally, I think that if you are at the Galleria and want a burger, the burgers at Houlihans are better.  Also, and this may seem petty, but I hate being served on plastic plates with the paper on the plate.  We won't bother going back, we felt the same way about the BRGR in East Liberty.  Too bad, I was hoping for a success at that location, it has been through a few iterations of restaurants."}
{"text":"Before going to an elite event in east liberty, my boyfriend and I decided to check out BRGR for happy hour! We came around 530 on a Thursday and it was decently crowded in the restaurant area, but the bar wasn't- so we sat there :). Our bartender was friendly to us right Away and was very helpful in assisting me with figuring out what beer I wanted! I ordered four seasons bang bang double IPA, my boyfriend ordered helles lager by southern tier brewing. The happy hour special was that each beer was $2 off, which was pretty awesome! My beer was incredible and so was my boyfriends! I was really glad that the bartender suggested it for me! 

After drinking a beer, I decided to try the grilled cheese bites for a small appetizer! They were a little pricey for what we received. The presentation demonstrated well how this appetizer isn't meal for more than two people and that it was basically grilled cheese on a stick. Having said that, it was incredibly tasty! The chipotle sauce on it was amazing and i loved dipping the bites into tomato sauce, how cool?! 

I really like this place. It was my 3rd time being here and I was never disappointed ."}
{"text":"We came as a group of 11 and within only 5 min they were able to put enough tables together to seat us all. The adult shakes were fantastic and everyone enjoyed the enormous burgers. So why only 2 stars I hear you ask?? Well simple 2 of us got the symptoms of food poisoning the morning after...
Our guess was the burgers as we both ordered medium rare, and no one else did but who knows for sure. I write this review not to 'flame' the restaurant, but to warn everyone that even the most upscale places can screw up every so often."}
{"text":"God awful burgers, full of fat. Went once and never will return. Bad experience and truly disappointed"}
{"text":"This place is a hit of miss. The burgers are tasty [the food truck versions are better] but the service can be awful. 

I've had the range from pleasant and efficient to catching them bad-mouthing my group who had left them a good sized food and an even bigger drink bill [during happy hour non-the-less] and still had the audacity to loudly complain we made them work while we were sitting 2 seats away from them at the bar next door. 

Take it what it is. Consistent and decent enough quality."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the movies and then found BRGR. We had to wait half an hour to be seated but it was a Friday night.  Food was good ,hamburgers are large ,liked putting my own hamburger together.  Everything is a la cart.  Sides are big enough for two or three people. Service was great. My hamburger was a bit on the raw side for medium but still good. Family friendly and good atmosphere for all. They are expanding and I would love to come back in the summer when you can eat on the balcony."}
{"text":"Best milkshakes in the city. Highly recommend the salted caramel and the spiked pumpkin (seasonal in the fall).

They also have great sides - the tater tots and fried pickles are incredible.

Better milkshakes than Burgatory but Burgatory has the better burgers."}
{"text":"My first time at this place, walked in and was told to go upstairs.  I didn't care where I sit, but thought that was strange considering dining room was empty.  The place is nicely decorated, and upstairs is an outdoor rooftop lounge.

Was recommended the bison burger with sweet potato fries.  Burger was tasty but I requested no spicy due to stomache issues but it came loaded with jalapeños.  Sweet potatoes were very salty.

Doing work in the area so might try them again.  Overall food was good but service might need more than just smiles."}
{"text":"The food at this hyped uber chain was fairly good. The truffle fries were memorable. Wait staff barely paid attention to our table. We met another couple for dinner & shortly after finishing our meals & cocktails we were asked to leave as others were waiting for our table. We were shocked to say the least. We felt that if you're going to kick us out we should at least been offered an incentive to do so as we were paying customers just as everyone else in the place. None of us will be returning."}
{"text":"Burgers are very low quality. Service is cordial and bland. Tots taste like food you'd eat after a night of drinking. Wouldn't dine again."}
{"text":"BEST turkey burger I have ever had. I want to keep going back to try all of their burgers, but I can't stop getting the turkey one. Try it!! 

Oh yeah, can I just say, awesome job on the branding!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to go out for a date night and have been wanting to try out BRGR for a while. I'm always on the hunt for a good burger! I'm happy to say that BRGR is a solid burger joint.

We started off with a salted caramel and vanilla milkshake spiked with bourbon. The flavor combination works, but I almost wanted a separate vanilla milkshake and the bourbon on the rocks in another glass. We wanted to try both The BRGR and the Smokehouse Bison burger, so we ordered both and they cut the burger in half for us so we could each try a bit of the other. That was nice of them. 

The BRGR was eh, kinda just a normal burger. The Smokehouse Bison was awesome. Juicy, spicy, and the chipotle aioli worked really well the rest of the toppings. We also got fries with parmesan and herbs and the \"truffle cheese whiz.\" The server assured us that it was actual cheese whiz mixed with truffle oil, but a housemade blend of cheese and truffle oil. It was awesome. If I go back, I'll definitely order those fries again."}
{"text":"We went to BRGR last night with high hopes of simple but delicious food. I had heard it was very good.    Had to wait about 30 minutes for a table (they don't take reservations for small parties).  When we were finally seated, they took us up two flights of stairs to what I believe in warmer weather is an open air roof deck.  They enclose it and add heaters to accommodate the crowds.  It took a while for anyone to even acknowledge us and get drinks.  We ordered everything all at once.  One of us ordered the \"Average Joe\", one of us ordered the \"Schrooms Burger\" and I ordered the Salmon Burger.  We also ordered some of the burger fries.  It was all just average.  By the time I food actually got to the table, it wasn't hot, just mildly warm.  

I guess I should mention that the service we received was just plain horrible.  I know it was a Saturday night, but at one point, when it was clear that nobody was going to refill our drinks, my boyfriend actually had to get up and walk over to the bar and ask for a refill.   After our food was delivered, we never saw another server.  Nobody cleared the dishes away.  Nobody came by to ask how everything was.  We waited and waited for someone to give us a check so we could get the hell out of there.  Suddenly our original server showed up...a bit befuddled and apologized to us because he said he \"forgot\" that we were his table.  I felt kind of bad for him at one point when he kept apologizing and offering us dessert.  Too late.  It was only a so so food experience.  No need to go back."}
{"text":"well we ended up here on a whim. we tried to go to nola in market square but it was PACKED. not in the mood for that

brgr fit in perfect. once again it all starts amazing valets (apparently love  a f250 diesel more then fancy cars) and a 10 minute wait on a friday perfect!

we grabbed a beer from the bar 2 pabst 12 oz cans for 2 dollars.sounds good in my book! also seemed like they had a different variety of beer then your typical restaurant .as soon as we opened the beer we were seated up stairs on the rooftop patio. very good for people watching.quite the perfect night for patio seating as well!

we placed our order with a very very very good waitress which i forgot to see what her name was on the bill. i got the devonshire which is a turkey burger with roasted turkey leg ontop of the burger and bacon and a sauce that tied everything together. this burger was amazing in every way not one complaint juicy. tasteful.spiced just right. my girlfriend got the shroom  burger she said it was really good but i didnt try it. also got an order of fries which were also done to perfection!they are tossed with parm cheese and parsley.

all and all i was very very happy with the pricing the quality and a perfect night for dinner on their balcony.

this place blows burgatory out of the water but i think tesarros still holds its own because of the different approach to the burgers."}
{"text":"First time here and it was pretty good. 

They have a large downstairs with bar and open garage doors to let the outdoors in. Upstairs is an outdoor rooftop patio with a bar. A good place for summer. 

I ordered the mushroom burger which was good. The mustard sauce was a little strong, I would have liked to have tasted more of the burger which was made well. My fries were delicious and so was my cookies and cream milkshake.

I heard mixed reviews but this place is definitely worth trying. Unlike others, I thought this was better than the flavorless burnt hamburger and burnt potato chips I had at that religious cow place."}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals. We had good service and everyone enjoyed their food. I didn't even get a burger, I had a beet salad that was surprisingly delicious. One of the best i've had! Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"My suggestion for this place is to drive the extra 15 minutes to the nearest Burgatory and get something that is actually good. Hell if 15 minutes is to far for you, there is a Red Robin a half mile away go there, their prices and product are better than this place. My wife and I went here for a late dinner during the week, after hearing mostly positive reviews about this place we decided to give it a try. This place really left something to be desired. Other than the service which was fine, and the appetizer; we were pretty disappointed. We each had an exaggeratedly overpriced beer, with tax my run of the mill IPA was over $9 and she got a $7 strongbow cider, that is stadium like prices.  Our burgers were flavorless, greasy, hunks of meat which left something to be desired. Another thing that annoyed me with this place is there are no sides with your burger, if I am going to pay $13 for a mediocre burger, I would expect some sort of side fries, chips, something. After all said and done I paid over $60 with tip to be disappointed by a subpar burger. Hope this helps."}
{"text":"Rather late to game here, but I thought I'd add my reaction to the mix...

A friend and I sat at the bar last night for dinner.   Two drinks each.  We each had burgers, fries and I sampled the cole slaw.  Walked away only $65 poorer ($80 with the tip).   I mention the price at the beginning only because I was impressed that a place this nice with a staff so professional and friendly wasn't charging FAR more.  I honestly didn't expect to pay $6 for a burger in a place like this.   

We ordered the 'average joe' with provolone and bacon.   Decent burger.  Well made.  Fresh bun and toppings.   

Have to agree with Alan about the fries.  Very nicely cooked but I had a hard time tasting the parmesan.   

The cole slaw was very good, and I like the large \"chunky\" approach.

The bar staff was attentive, prompt and friendly without going overboard.   

I also appreciated the good mix of people at BRGR: families, older couples, young singles, etc.   And though the place had an energy to it, you could still hold a conversation without having to shout.  

I think this is going to become one of my regular hangouts.   Decent food, priced fairly in a comfortable atmosphere and with solid service."}
{"text":"Looking to try something new, Jenn G and I decided on BRGR for lunch due to its proximity to my house and the fact I needed to be picked up like a 12 year old.

The place was decently busy for a Friday afternoon, but we definitely had our pick of where to sit. We decided on the upstairs deck to take advantage of the warm (but rainy) weather.

I went with the Kobe burger and was really happy with the decision. There were enough toppings to keep things interesting, but it was still very manageable to eat without making a mess of myself and the table.

We split the Parmesan fries which I'm mixed on. The fries themselves were perfectly prepared, but the Parmesan? Just a few shavings over the top, not even melted.

Slight fry disappointment aside, I will be returning to BRGR for sure."}
{"text":"I must have been at a different place than all the other reviewers.  I had a very pleasant experience while I was here for the first time.

The wait staff was very polite and chatty as can be.  Attentive to our needs and always coming back around to refill our drinks.  The food was delicious.  I opted for the California Lovin', I was craving and in need of a turkey burger and it hit the spot.  The pesto mayo and alfalfa sprouts was quite the nice mixture.  On a wheat bun was a great choice as well.

My only downside here is that I was unaware that a burger only came with a pickle as a side.  I was kind of expecting to receive chips or fries as a side, but just a plain old dill pickle.  Next time I'll be sure to add a side or get an appetizer to start."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place after a year of living in Pittsburgh. It was a decent experience, but Burgatory is way better for quality, ambience, milkshakes, and general value for money. I ordered one of their beef burgers with spicy Sriracha and an added fried egg. It was a good burger, but I just wasn't wowed. My fiancé had the fish and shrimp party burger, which he said was good. None of the burgers come with fries - they only come with a slice of pickle - so we had to order sweet potato fries on the side. The fries were too salty for our liking. Service was not great - servers felt like they were a little snobby and disinterested in their job. Overall, 3 stars for a very 'blah' experience that wasn't very memorable."}
{"text":"We loved this place. What a great selection of burgers and sides. The service was great. Beer selection amazing."}
{"text":"My salmon sandwich was good, as were the fries which you do get a lot of but after I tipped, the bill came to almost $17! Also, the bun was super generic, perhaps from Giant Eagle? Give me a choice of bread for the price you're charging! The menu could have been a little more innovative; to say the least; I think they're playing it safe like so many restaurants around here do. As it turns out, BRGR is also the name of a restaurant chain in New York, but unlike the Brgr in Pittsburgh, which says nothing about organic and grass-fed on their web-site, New York's BRGR only uses grass-fed and organic AND the prices are the same if not less expensive. The sad thing is, this restaurant will probably do well because most Pittsburghers naively accept over-priced mediocre food being disguised as something high end and special. Just look at Nakama."}
{"text":"I enjoyed BRGR more when it first opened, but less so recently. I am not as adventurous with my burger choices so I always order the same thing. Plus, I think it's odd fries or chips don't come with a burger meal. There is a nice draft selection which is a plus."}
{"text":"Burgers are good. Fries are good. Service is horrible at this location! We've been there a few times and every server we've had is stuck up, or give the impression it's a bother to wait on us. Go to one of the other locations!"}
{"text":"a friend recommended this place but I'm not a fan. Tried several different apps and burgers but nothing really stood out. I'd rather go to burgatory."}
{"text":"After calling to check the wait time three days over the course of a couple weeks, the hostess told us about the NoWait app. After downloading the app, I was able to get on the list without having to be at the restaurant. GENIOUS! The wait time in the app said 45-1 hour. We arrived 50 minutes later and our table was ready. I overheard the hostess apologize as she told those in line without the app that they'd have a hour long wait. On a side note, this was actually not as bad as the other times we called- 2+ hour wait. So, the real question was would BRGR live up to the hype and extraordinary wait times? The answer - in short- No.

I started with a chocolate milkshake while hubs got a martini. The shake was thick and tasty. No complaints there. The food came out quickly, especially the kids meal. I ordered the Average Joe with white cheddar. I was looking for the basic burger so that I could really taste the flavor and quality of the meat. Hubs ordered a salmon burger and we split the BRGR fries which were described as being topped with parmesan and herbs. Being preggo, I had to order my burger well done. Regardless of the temp, my expectation at a restaurant that specializes in burgers is to have a well seasoned, juicy burger. What I ended up with was a dry, somewhat tasteless piece of meat. The fries were also decidedly average. The parm and herbs were lightly sprinkled on top and did not stick to the fries. On a positive note, the service was great. Overall, I am in no rush to get back to BRGR. Nothing stood out to me as being spectacular. Maybe the crazy toppings on some of the specialty burgers add the missing flavor element. But, I've had better \"basic\" burgers at places like Smashburger."}
{"text":"Decent food for the price. Their dry aged beef is on par. Their onion rings are perfectly juicy and delicious. The fries were seasoned, not too thick or thin. The smores milkshake was delicious but not worth the alcoholic version"}
{"text":"I just had a to go order but it was simple, fast, and the burger was amazing!. ................. ................. ................. ................. ................. ................. ................. ................. ................. ................."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I have a food allergy and made it clearly known to my server. My food came out the first time and the burger temp was swapped with my dining companion. The second time it was served with the allergic food. The third time it was over cooked. The fourth time it came out with the allergy food. And the server exclaimed \"no one told me.\" At the point ... I'm done with burgers.  When my bill came... I hoped to not be charged for my burger but was then charged for the fries?! Not nice. I finally had to ask for the Manager.  The Manager cane and excused herself for not knowing about my Manager and threw the server under the bus for not telling her. How about being careful of plating food according to the order? Oh well, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Burgatory is a thousand times better. Crack tip looks and tastes like vomit to me. Will never go here again. Couch seating was uncomfortable and dumb."}
{"text":"There was no option for no stars.  Terrible service. Empty place. Manager and servers loudly gossiping and standing at the corner of the bar. Manager having a beer in a to go cup. Two burgers took over 30 minutes to make with no other customers in the place. Ordered medium got dry, medium well.  Poutine was half cooked.  Will not come back."}
{"text":"This pregnant girl was craving a huge, messy burger and BRGR satisfied that craving!  Everyone at the table loved their burger, each with a different one off the menu.  We also enjoyed the chips with crack dip, french fries and fried pickles which were THA BOMB!  Only thing I regret not ordering was a milkshake but it was because I couldn't fit anymore in my tummy!"}
{"text":"I came here for the location, and it certainly did not disappoint. The rooftop patio was super beautiful with views of Centre Avenue on one side and way better views of the church on Penn Ave.

I had the Santa Fe hippie burger, and it was pretty good. I liked how the burger was made not just of black beans but also a falafel-y type mixture. 

As a side we shared the tater tots, which were phenomenol. However, they were so flavorful that it was a little overshadowing of the burger itself. 

I didn't get a chance to try the milkshakes, but the spiked root beer floats sounded amazing."}
{"text":"Burger wars!! Let's dive in to the battle eh.

Brgr has a nice ambiance to it; casual, sophisticated but not too pretentious. TV's spaced out so you can catch a game; they even had Fox Soccer  Channel on!  There's upstairs outdoor seating but it seems to fill up pretty quickly. I came here on a random weeknight and we were able to get seating for two without a wait.

Service is a little slow and the server forgot to bring out my drink until we were halfway through the burgers. There's a pretty broad selection of burgers and I wish I had gotten something more exotic. Both of us got the kobe beef burger, which was cooked nicely (I prefer a medium for burgers). It had a nice crunch and the bun held up. The fries were good and the cheez whiz sauce was delicious! I don't know what they did to the ol' standby cheez whiz but it was excellent.

Overall, I don't know that Brgr does anything to truly distinguish itself. I'll be more than happy to come back and try it again but in one sitting, the fare didn't impress me the way Wingharts and Tessaro's instantly did. (Note to self to try the milkshakes next time as that might up the star rating by one if as good as reviewed on Yelp).

In the Pittsburgh burger wars betwixt Brgr, Tessaro's, Wingharts, I think Brgr comes in third. No shame in losing out to those two joints as Brgr does produce a decent quality burger anyway."}
{"text":"Wow
I am beyond full!!
Very delicious and well prepared 
Great fry cook..perfect on the onion rings
Excellent burgers and off the charts milk shakes-salty caramel"}
{"text":"I love the way this restaurant is set up.  The open air options and rooftop deck are a huge plus in my opinion.  Another great thing about this restaurant are the options.  It pleases the meat lover and vegetarian alike.  I have had the \"Tree Hugger\" burger:  lentil + falafel burger, hot + sour cucumbers, tomato, red onion,goat's milk yogurt  - it is so delicious that I feel guilty about eating a veggie burger!  I have also tried the \"Love You Long Time\" burger  - 5 oz Ahi tuna patty, avocado +wasabi puree, pickled cucumbers + daikon radish, chili aioli, sweet soy sauce -- since this is sushi grade tuna, i simply had it seared and it was AWESOME!  My boyfriend is a huge fan of the meat burgers... and we always get the fried pickles to share.  The salted caramel spiked shake is awesome and they have a great selection of beers too!"}
{"text":"I first dined at BRGR when they had just opened and again a week or two later the service was slow but the food quality was superb. I recently returned to the restaurant with my wife for lunch and the kinks in their service times appear to have been worked out; the food quality again did not disappoint and in fact remains extremely good."}
{"text":"After a two hour wait, a mediocre meal. Good appetizers, but salmon burger was bland and burgers greasy. Server was the best part of our dinner."}
{"text":"I have not eaten inside this location but I got take out. They were quick with my order and completed it within 15 minutes. I will return to this establishment. By Burger was Delicious and the homemade chips were good."}
{"text":"This was the second time we went to galleria brgr and the second was so much better!
I don't know what it was the first time we went, maybe it was because it just opened or that it was just so busy, but the service was terrible and the food wasn't great.
We tried again tonight and it was so much better.
We sat outside and the service was on point. Danielle our waitress was friendly and very good. I had the build your own burger. Angus, brioche with avocado and béarnaise  aioli. The draft beer selection was limited but  a good mix. My wife had the shroom burger with hard toasted almond shake! Both were tasty.
I always am happy when I give someone another chance and they redeem themselves."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this chain's competitor, Burgatory. I had heard mixed reviews for BRGR, but thought it was worth assessing for myself which was indeed the burger regent supreme. I ordered the Gobbler, which includes a turkey burger, sage stuffing, pickled green beans, and cranberry relish on a buttered brioche, along with an almond praline milkshake. The shake was good.

A note about the service, which docked a star from my rating. First, the server was unbelievably rude to one of my dinner partners when carding him. She grabbed his ID roughly, and scowled as she spent about 5 minutes assessing he legitimacy of his license. Note- we all look a little young, but he is well over 21. Second, my dinner partners are both gluten free (not by choice), part of what made us select this location - they have a dedicated GF fryer. The server left our table after we had thanked her for the restaurant's attention to GF needs. Her sarcastic parting words - \"We will TRY our best to make sure everything is gluten free\"....Hmmmm. Not the most confidence boosting when A) it's not a choice, and B) when we just mentioned that we drove nearly 30 minutes out of our way to get to your location...

The turkey burger was tasty, but not at all memorable. My dinner partners said their beef burgers were good, not great. They were not very polite when my friend asked for a burger a touch off rare. Our Cajun tater tots were more like paprika tater tots. I'm just not convinced that this place is worth the drive or the money. I will almost certainly NOT be back. Maybe with a different server the food would earn 3 stars, but I don't think I'll be driving out this way for a burger again."}
{"text":"I was extremely impressed with the burgers here! I live 5 minutes from a rival burger chain (Burgatory), so I rarely make it to a BRGR. The service was prompt, friendly, and they took care of my food allergies. They have gluten free options and dedicated fryers, so just let your waiter know if you have dietary restrictions!  They have a very unique cocktail menu with fun names (this is a selling point for me, I admit it!). I had a play on a Pisco sour and my mom had a Cosmo... both very well mixed! 

As for the burgers, I couldn't have a bun because of food allergies, but my mom was able to get a Gluten Free bun. The burger patties have a nice char on the outside and are extremely juicy and flavorful. I didn't even miss the bun because the patty was so good. 

I will likely still frequent Burgatory more because they have more allergy-friendly options for me, but overall, this was an excellent dining experience!"}
{"text":"I came here one time. Just one. Once was enough, I think. I was curious to try it after my co-workers raved about the food. So we all went. It wasn't busy at all and we got seated immediately. The waiter seemed very nice and friendly. He probably should write things down though, as half of our drink orders were wrong. The food came out and other things were wrong with our orders. He promptly fixed everything, but half of us got to eat while the other half waited. As for the food? It was ok. The burgers were decent in size, but lacking flavor, and very expensive. Everything you get on your burger is basically an added expense. My husband and I got fairly simple burgers, iced tea, no alcohol, and our bill was still nearly 40 dollars. For that much money, we could get a much nicer meal elsewhere. Not sure what everyone raves about here."}
{"text":"We ended up here after Union Pig and Chicken was closed. Place was alright, nothing really special. The menu went on about how good their burgers are, but I didn't think the beef was anything special. Burger was OK, but I've had much better. I may go back if I'm in the area kind of late again, otherwise I doubt it."}
{"text":"Wow. I have wanted to come here for a while and finally made it. The for was great. Drinks were expertly made and the Button Buster was delicious. I'll be making another visit again, soon."}
{"text":"I went here tonight for the first time with a friend of mine expecting it to be pretty good since I've heard good things about it. Overall, my experience wasn't horrible but it definitely wasn't great. They had a pretty cool selection of beer so that was a good start. Our appetizer was yummy - fried pickles. Obviously can't go wrong with that. But we asked for extra plates since the pickles were like 3,000 degrees and impossible to eat at first, but the plates never came. Our burgers got to our table super quick so that was nice and we weren't concerned with getting plates for our appetizer anymore. The burger itself was good but the bun was super mediocre and thin so I wasn't impressed with that. BUT the worst part of it all was our waitress. She didn't have even the slightest smile on her face, was super impatient with me when I couldn't decide which beer to get at first, and rushed us through our meal when there were only two parties in line. I totally get that's what restaurants need to do when they're busy but uhhhh they weren't busy at all so why be so rude about it? Especially when there are 2 or 3 empty tables around us. I'm glad I tried it but I probably won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time with my boyfriend. Both of us ended up sick. Food lacked flavor as well. Our waitress was great and so was the atmosphere. That's the only reason I'm giving them any credit."}
{"text":"The meat was so delicious! I got the button buster and I was so impressed. I asked for it well done, and it was juicy and amazing. I'm always worried that my meat will be dry when I order well done, but this was on point perfect."}
{"text":"Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!!!

This place is everything that Burgatory should be. I love the burgers. They're always cooked to the proper temperature and the topping choices are great. I'm also a fan of the shakes and fries. It's a great place to unwind with friends and get loose and it's also a great place for a business lunch that is guaranteed to impress.

The place consistently turns out great food and friendly service in my experience.

I like this place a lot, but if you're on a quest for the perfect burger 
see Tessaro's."}
{"text":"My group was a little worried because this seemed to be the only restaurant we passed downtown after a Pirates game that wasn't packed - but we needed some sustenance so we gave it a shot. The interior is pretty hip, warm, trendy etc. But the food is fairly standard bar/burger items with a few twists like spiked milkshakes and multiple sides that interested me. 

The service was pretty abysmal but our waiter admitted they were understaffed and he was clearly doing the best he could. But our food came out in a timely manner and was pretty tasty. 

I got the Santa Fe Hippie, their version of a black bean/falafel burger that was good and the rest of my group was pleased with their angus burgers. We got a side of chips and the house crack dip, which was a little cold from probably sitting around and the ratio of chips to dip was way off IMHO. 

Overall if I was back in Pittsburgh this would by no means be my first stop, but it is worth a look if you happen to be nearby."}
{"text":"Looks like I found a new favorite place to eat. 
So we stopped in after the lunch rush was over. Love the menu, a lot of didn't things I wanted to try. I decided on the Smokehouse Bison burger and we shared a order of onion rings. The food came out hot and fresh. The Bison burger has smoked cheddar,  mushrooms, onion straws,  jalapenos,  & bbq-chipotle aioli.  One of the best if not the best burger I ever had. Great flavors, fresh. The onion rings were hot and crispy. Another plus was they had PBR beer. Didn't get a shake this time but definitely next time. Looking at the chicken and waffles next trip."}
{"text":"Dear BRGR,

Thank you for the delightful falafel burger I enjoyed here with friends the other day. I enjoyed it thoroughly, paired with the boozy salted caramel milkshake (which helped make my night 10 times better, thankyouverymuch) and the incredible shoestring french fries with truffle cheese wiz. Whoever came up with the truffle cheese wiz deserves a raise in my book!

While I find your decorating and style to be a tiny bit... ohh, lacking?... I can forgive you since a little bird recently told me that you'd be doing a bit of an overhaul of your menu and ambiance. Hopefully this rumor holds true!

What I must ULTIMATELY thank you for, however, is saving my boyfriend's fancy pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses that I'd given him as a gift for Christmas (he'd apparently left it behind at our table). Your service and assistance in our search proved successful and we triumphed in the end! No words can express our gratitude for your help.

Sincerely,

Stephanie T."}
{"text":"Eh. Maybe I was expecting too much? Overall, this place was a letdown, though closer to 2.5 than 2. Let's review, shall we?

Pros: 
1. They text you when your table is ready. I like not having to stick within 10 feet of the host, especially in a crowded space like Brgr.
2. Spiked Milkshakes. Seriously, this was pretty much the only redeeming factor. These things are the bomb-diggity. Salted Caramel and The Dude (think White Russian) are to die for. Prepare for multiple brain freezes.
3. They can cook meat to the requested temperature. Sadly, this can be a rare quality, and Brgr nailed a Med Rare, Med, and a Med Well.
4. The fries were good, and the truffle cheese whiz was OK.

Cons:
1. Our server sucked. I won't go into the details, but she was a space cadet.
2. The fried pickles are spears, and they're nothing to write home about. Especially since they're, like, $1/spear.
3. My Kobe burger was just OK. Honestly, I took 2 bites, and was done.  I didn't get onions on mine since another burger at the table requested no onions, and there was barely any bleu cheese. The whole thing was dry.
4. It's expensive.

I'll try you again, BRGR, and hopefully we can go up a star or two next visit."}
{"text":"Regular food
Bad management
Bad services 
Very expensive for a mediocre burger 
Never coming back"}
{"text":"Put simply: I'll be returning to BRGR.

What an incredible menu of all my favorite things.  I had the Button Buster and a Bourbon Cherry spiked shake.  WHEN I return I will definitely be trying those fries out.

The wait was long (but worth it).  The cool thing though was they took my cell # and texted me when the table was ready.  We went down to the bar down the street while we waited.  Awesome."}
{"text":"Please note that I did their new delivery option.  (EAT24 - Needs to add this restaurant).

I ordered the BRGR burger and Fries (with Gravy).    I ordered my Burger - medium.   The burger was slightly overcooked but very tasty.   The red onions, arugula, creamy bleu cheese, and oven roasted tomatoes provided a nice flavor profile.   I thought it was a good burger.   I did say away from the foie gras based other reviews and was not will to \"jump out of a tree\" with the cost.   The burger was not bland but I think that was due to the toppings.

French Fries were really good.  They reminded me of McDonalds for some reason (thin cut / crispy - even on delivery).   The gravy was tasty as well.   If only they offered some cheese curds, I could have had poutine :).

I thought overall this was good.   Price / Delivery Charge was high.    I will order again but only on occasion due to the cost. 

Delivery Note - Delivery was fast considering the time I ordered."}
{"text":"Best burger joint in Pittsburgh! :-)
If you want a religious experience with a deep fried pickle - this is where you have it! Exceptional value for money and an extensive beer list. Friendly staff and a real laid back atmosphere. BRGR is a must ... even if you hate fastfood. This is good-greasy."}
{"text":"Meh is right.  I've def experienced better.

The staff here is rude.  Not friendly, not helpful, and they don't appreciate your business because they dont have to--this place is small and it's always packed.  This could be made a fun part of an 'experience' if the staff was friendly but as it stands all four times I've dined here the staff acted like I was burdening them.

Just because they say the burgers are gourmet and price them accordingly does not mean they are going to be good.  The first two times I was there the burgers were over cooked.  The third time, it had no flavor, and the fourth time I gave up and just had an $8 beer.

If you want a burger in East LIberty listen--go across the street to Kelly's, they have a better burger there.  Or try something else--Abay is around the corner, Dinette is across the street.

These are unremarkable burgers at prices that are going make you remark \"Damn!\" when your bill comes."}
{"text":"It's pretty darn good, but I always leave feeling like everything cost twice as much and was twice as greasy as it should have been. However I love the option to build your burger, and there are adult milkshakes are really good"}
{"text":"I've been to BRGR before, but made a recent trek on a Wednesday after work. It was a pleasant surprise that there was no wait. On prior trips I've gone on the weekend and had to wait longer than Kim Kardashian's marriage.

We were quickly seated and our server was very friendly. For some reason, I wasn't feeling terribly adventurous tonight and decided to just get the Average Joe with feta bacon and a side of fries.

The food came out and looked great, but my burger seemed out of place on such a large bun. In prior experiences I hadn't noticed this because it was covered in so much other deliciousness (see the short ribs on the button buster). The food tasted ok. The burger wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. The same can be said for the fries as well. 

Overall, the food at BRGR is decent, but it's probably not going to knock your socks off, especially compared to some of the other burger places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Nothing out of the ordinary - The burgers are pretty good. The service is a hit or miss depending on where you sit (inside or roof top). Yes, they have a nice roof top seating. If you haven't been here before - the place is the old Red Room - and basically the settings are exactly the same."}
{"text":"A great spot to meet at BRGR in the Galleria.  A bonus to sit out on their beautiful patio on a warm evening.  Burger was excellent and the fries delicious and can be shared."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now, and all I can say is \"meh, I've experienced better\" just like the rating system here says.  Maybe I was spoiled by the B Spot in Cleveland, I do not know, but BRGR leaves little to be desired. 

I can make a better burger on my own at home (and one that would be more healthy), I will say though that the homemade chips are yummy and they have a lot of good milkshakes.  

The staff can use some help in terms of their attitudes as well... what ever happened to service with a smile?  It definitely did not exist on this most recent visit to BRGR.  Living in the Southside, we like to venture out to other parts of town once in awhile but if I want a burger, I will hit up Winghart's down the street.... they are way better and so is the service."}
{"text":"So I had my proverbial BRGR cherry broken and it was amazing. Thank you Brenna/Jenna (I feel like an asshole that I forgot...whoops) whatever your name is ladyfriend for the wonderful service.

Went in to eat with my ladyfriend Terra sat at one of the lovely high-top tables near the window. Ended up ordering their Thai Pork and Shrimp Brgr and their King Salmon. One half for me the other half for Terra.

Thai Pork and Shrimp - Simply delicious. The end.

King Salmon - Unfortunately this one wasn't so delicious. Terra has requested for her initial temp for this sandwich to MR (medium-rare) and Brenna/Jenna let us know that their MR would be more on the rarer side and Terra requested just as long as it wasn't translucent and not dry to go for M(medium). Upon shoveling the Thai Pork and Shrimp BRGR down we made our way over to this sandwich and it didn't quite hold up very well the texture wasn't quite what we expected (the bad way) so we were a wee bit disappointed. Oh well. You can't win them all. I'd say stay away.

Brgrs brgrs aside we definitely did start our busy day with a milkshake. I was feeling kind of seasonal so I ordered The Great Pumpkin although it was a pretty tough decision between the peanut buttery \"The King\" shake though. I requested to have an extra cup be brought over to share which Brenna/Jenna graciously brought over. I kid you not happiness in the pants. :)

All in all fun times at BRGR will go again soon. Next time maybe Ill do dessert."}
{"text":"I have been to this spot a few times and really enjoy it.  The atmosphere is similar to Burgatory or the Yard.  Great place to get a drink and a good burger.

A favorite appetizer of mine here are the grilled cheese bites.  They are crispy, cheesy, and taste amazing.  They also pair well with the tomatoe soup side you get with them.

My favorite burger here is the steakhouse.  It comes on a toasted brioche bun which does a great job of holdiall of the toppings and burger together.  The combination of the bleu cheese, aioli, and onion strings is perfect.  I order mine medium rare and they always cook it perfectly.  

Having said that, the burgers here are not on the level of the best in the city.  It is essentially a lesser version of burgatory."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, disappointing food. I Ordered a burger medium as I was told its pink all the way through, round one was a fail and it was sent back...Round two came out over cooked as well but I don't think three times a charm with BRGR so I plunged in face first.



End result $35 down the drain, next time I'll go to five guys."}
{"text":"If your excited about the East Liberty Area upgrade and selection then this adds to the list of great places to eat at - I've eaten here on several occasions and finally sat down for a grade - it's right down the street from my favorite Wing joint Buffalo Blues so it doesn't get the love it deserves - I stand in the principal that the meat should be tasty enough to eat plain and this place has a signature taste to its meat. 3rd in the Order of preference only because it's side items don't really support the main course and their Milk Shake needs steroids to compete with Burgatory! All in All I could eat here everyday"}
{"text":"A bit expensive, but a very delicious burger! You can choose the type of meat you'd like for your patty (or a veggie burger if that's your thing!). They also give you a choice of bread and a few different combinations of toppings. The fries were seasoned and topped with shaved parmesan which is always a plus!!

I got to try the food truck at the Bloomfield Italian Festival and was very impressed. I will definitely give them another try!"}
{"text":"Its was ok. I always enjoy eating at Brgr. But this time i got the shrimp paddie and house chips. The burger was ok (bland) & the dressing was watered down. With no cheese. I wouldnt order it again...i could only eat a small amount of house chips. They were too hard and very oily. I normally get the Parma fries which r way better. I still like Brgr i just didnt enjoy my food today."}
{"text":"On a crowded Saturday night, our party of 4 was able to score a table near the back.  BRGR has a great atmosphere for a weekend dinner, and the $3 valet parking on this crowded street is a definite plus.  

Our table ordered a Greek salad, fries to share, and 3 burgers: the Button Buster, Fire in the Hole, and Maui Wowie.  The salad was as expected, and the fries were plentiful.  The burgers came out very cutely presented with little wooden picks indicating the doneness ordered.

Since it was our first experience at BRGR, my partner and I were indecisive on whether to order our Button Buster rare or medium rare, as I am endlessly wary of overcooked meat.  After speaking to our server, who pointed out the \"Doneness Guide\" on our menu and assured us that they were sticklers for turning out the burgers with the correct expected doneness, we opted for medium rare.  Our burger came out medium well and tasted overcooked even to my other half, who prefers his meat more cooked than I do.  I prefer my meat rare, so to me, it tasted like someone had ruined some perfectly good short rib.  I would definitely have sent it back had I not been sharing the dish with my decidedly unpicky partner.

I did not try the other two burgers, but our friends were in agreement that they much preferred the Maui Wowie to the Fire in the Hole, which they deemed only okay.  Overall, I was pretty underwhelmed by the food and won't choose BRGR for its burgers again."}
{"text":"This is a classic case of poor service ruining a meal. The service was subpar and the waitress was nonexistent at times. Our party of five was placed in a loud bar area and the waitress seemed to forget about us. The food was decent but the lack of service definitely ruined the meal. The overall experience was forgettable and we will not go back."}
{"text":"I went here with high expectations, which were quickly and rudely dashed. The burgers are covered with slop and it's almost impossible to find a side dish that isn't fried. Don't go here looking for a healthy meal. You'll get your entire week's fat intake in one sitting.  It also tends to be crowded and noisy, like a sports bar.  The menu seems limited to sauce-slathered crap, with a side of something greasy, with a dippy-cup full of more melted slop.  For supposedly being a high-end burger joint, the food is remarkably juvenile.  I picture their kitchen as having two tools: the broiler, and the deep fryer.  Next to a big pallet of fluffy buns.  And tubs of mayo and ranch dressing."}
{"text":"Great drinks, great appetizers, and good burgers.

I've been to BRGR on a few occasions for drinks and appetizers but, for some reason, never got around to trying the burgers. I ended up getting the shroom burger, some fried pickles, and a spiked shake. All were good, with my only complaint being the wait time.

I highly recommend the house chips and the fried pickles. The price is right and they have amazing, homemade flavor. The burger was by no means the beat burger I've had... but it was a pretty good burger."}
{"text":"BRGR was very busy this afternoon. And still, the service was great and the food was spot on. Juicy and delicious burgers, salad, and fries."}
{"text":"This place is unique and has good shakes but I wouldn't rave about the burgers. 

i got the shroomz, and it was very oily and greasy and wasn't bursting with the flavor I was expecting. 

Not enough brie, or mushrooms, I would say this is a regular burger joint with a cooler atmosphere.

Came here twice already, and i think the trend is that im going to be sticking with the fries/onion rings and forget about the burger! I can't get enough of the truffle cheese whiz!"}
{"text":"Alcoholic milkshakes, yup!!! Spiked shakes, as they like to call it. 

Diggin' the vibe. We sat at the bar and Allison was a fab bartender, extremely social, funny and informative. 

We were stuffed from dinner so we just headed in here to grab a milkshake... with locally made ice cream AND booze! I went with a classic of Salty Caramel: bourbon + sea salt caramel sauce + vanilla bean... yep! Do it!"}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to experience BRGR. There's was no wait around 9pm and we went in for dinner.

First things first, my bf ordered a non-spiked chocolate shake. It was literally the best shake I've ever had... Amazing. 

For dinner, I went with the Shrooms burger-- burger, forest mushrooms, caramelized onions, brie cheese & mustard aioli. My Burger was fabulous. I ordered a side of fries which has a nice season to the and sprinkled with cheese.

My bf ordered the Button Buster-- burger, short ribs, Cheddar cheese & an onion ring. He also ordered potato salad as a side. I tried both his Burger and salad & both were great. Burger was a little too much for me, but I loved the salad which was topped with fresh bacon. 

While our server was kind, he gave off this 'I don't really wanna be here' attitude. I initially wanted to give 3(.5) stars but decided to round it up to 4 because I know we'll be back.

I'm excited that we finally experienced BRGR. it was a good meal. I do want to note that I've never had Burgatory before.. I noticed a lot of reviews stating that it was better than here. Geez i need to head there now because I found BRGR pretty good!!"}
{"text":"In town visiting family for a few days and wanted a good burger so we landed at BRGR. The service was fast and friendly and the food was as expected. But oh my, the milkshakes! My little cousin got the s'mores shake and I was insanely jealous. When asked to describe it in 10 words, he said, and I quote, \"yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum.\" He's a man of many words."}
{"text":"I don't even like hamburgers much, but these are really delicious. Juicy and rich, with excellent combinations of toppings, and the spiked milkshakes are great, too! On the downside, it is a bit expensive when you consider that the burgers don't come with a side--that is, it's $10-12 for the burger alone, and then another $3-5 for fries. So, kinda pricey. But I've been here more than once, so it's worth it!

Also, the parking situation is atrocious--either street parking on the extremely crowded Penn Circle, or risk-getting-towed parking across the street at the PetSmart lot. Try to take public transit if you can, or I guess you could pay for the valet."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended BRGR for our get-together lunch. The menu had some unusual flavors for burgers. I ended up ordering a plain, typical burger. Otherwise, I would have ended up telling the waitress to leave off half of the toppings. My burger did taste good. The burger was a similar quality and price to what Burgatory sells. The restaurant got very busy while we were there, so I recommend showing up as soon as lunchtime or dinnertime starts.The waitress did a fine job."}
{"text":"Came here the other night for an early dinner. The inside of the restaurant is clean and well laid out. I ordered the Santa Fe hippie burger and the table split sides of fries and onion rings. I have never had a veggie burger like the one at BRGR. It was really dense and hard. It also lacked flavor. It had a slight falafel spice, which was strange with the guacamole topping. Also, the burgers are all $12-$15 and do not come with a side. At Burgatory you can get a much more delicious burger with a side for the same price. Will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Looking at their menu, I was a little skeptical about how good their burgers would be, but I was glad that everything went better than expected.

I got the Button Buster and my dinning partner got the Kobe Beef burger.  We requested it medium and medium rare, respectively, and they came out right on point.  Nicely done, brgr.  The best thing about these burgers were the buns.  They did not come out soggy (looks like someone rested their meat before plating!  Yes!), which is a huge bonus in my book.  Soggy buns are disgusting.  Their buns also withstood the manhandling they had to endure while being devoured.  Another huge bonus for not falling apart.

The shoestring fries weren't the best fries I've ever had, but they were plenty better than school cafeteria fries.  :p

We also got the daily special milkshake which was vanilla peanut butter.  It was amazing!  Probably one of the better milkshakes I've had in my time."}
{"text":"I can't believe I am writing the bad review because I have gone to BRGR and loved it! 

Three of us went and had a variety of burgers. I ordered a prime beef burger with two cheeses and an egg on top. It was remarkably bland and there was literally no cheese on 2/3 of the burger. That was the best burger. 

The person to my left had a burger wrapped in lettuce. Her burger came out with a hair on it. They did make a new burger for her. They also credited out the base burger but charged for the cheese and mushrooms.

The person to my right had a grass fed burger. She ordered it medium-well and it come out medium-rare to rare. They took it back and then brought out the replacement with items that were supposed to be kept off. Again they credited the main burger but charged for the additional items on the burger.

Not a single burger was correct that day. No excuse for that!"}
{"text":"The burgers are very creative and delicious, I had the mushroom brie burger and the Buffalo burger and they were both great.  The beer selection is fantastic- they have beers on tap that I haven't found on tap anywhere else in Pittsburgh.  Definitely try the fries with the \"cheese whiz\" (it's homemade- not the stuff from a can).  The milkshakes are amazing, they make their own ice cream.  It's great to bring friends to dinner here and have a fun evening with great food for about $25 a person (including fries, hamburger, milkshake and beer)."}
{"text":"I've been to the one in shadyside and the one downtown. The waiting time was ridiculously long at both places. But I guess the food especially the shakes is worth it. I really love their button buster and shroomz burgers."}
{"text":"BRGR has stopped using Dave & Andy's ice cream (even though they still claim to do so on their website). What a shame as it is by far the best ice cream in the city. The milkshakes don't compare to what they used to be, and it's frankly a major disappointment. Just another example of a corporation quietly serving their customer a lesser product without any price reduction. Shame on you, BRGR!"}
{"text":"We arrived at closing time...that may have affected my order.  I ordered the salmon burger and its ok! It wasn't very flavorful....very bland. The aioli sauce saved it from tasting like cardboard.  Sorry, but I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Unattentive bartenders could care less about customers. Big oaff \"dude\" behind bar trying to hit on other bartender whole time. Such a douchebag."}
{"text":"As a non-beef eater, I'm always leery of burger places.  I came here in Nov. on the recommendation of my labmate, who recommended their gobble gobble burger.  This burger has a turkey patty, cranberry aioli, pickled green beans, stuffing, and gravy--basically, it's Thanksgiving on a bun!  What a novel--and delicious--concept!  It was as delectable as it sounds.  My only complaint is that, if you put the gravy that comes on the side on it, it's quite messy, so make sure you ask for some extra napkins to clean up!  I ordered the tater tots with it, which were great for splitting between my dining companion, if a bit pedestrian.  On a subsequent visit, I ordered the homemade chips with it, which were also great to split, but again, I've had better (at Fat Heads). I also ordered the chocolate cherry bourbon spiked float, which had a nice smooth flavor.  I'm not a huge bourbon fan, however, and I preferred the adult root beer float, which I tried on a subsequent visit (yum!).

I went on a Sat. evening, and there was no wait.  Per the hostess's suggestion, I dined on the rooftop deck, which has a relaxed atmosphere and a great view of East Liberty/Shadyside.  Even though it was chilly, I didn't feel cold, thanks to the heat lamps.  Service was attentive without being overbearing.

Re: the question of BRGR vs. Burgatory, I thought the burgers (turkey and chicken, respectively) were very similar in quality.  Given that I don't eat beef, I can't comment on the beef burgers, or matters such as doneness.  I preferred the atmosphere at BRGR, whereas the shakes at Burgatory are more innovative.  I also felt that the sides were better at Burgatory, and I like that Burgatory provides free chips, at least (BRGR serves all entrees strictly a la carte, with no sides).  Location-wise, BRGR is more convenient to me.  Between all of these factors, it's a close toss-up, but Burgatory has a slight edge on food quality/innovativeness and value."}
{"text":"If you have a large party don't bother. Now, I understand large parties can be a pain. But it was my daughters birthday, and that's where she wanted to go. I showed up early to put our name on the list. The manager did everything but flat out ask us to go somewhere else. Well, it may be a half hour. That's ok, that's why I came early. Well, I can't guarantee it. Well we don't take reservations.  I said, cant i just put my name on the list!?!?!? Seriously! Had my kid not asked for BRGR, I would of gone downstairs to houlihans. The redeeming part of the evening? Our waiter. He was awesome. Food came out together, listened to the kids and verified what they wanted. Had he not been so nice, I would of been really mad when I realized I double tipped on the bill. They added 20% for a large party. I didn't notice til after. Normal practice and I should of known, my bad. But honestly, guy deserved it. I believe his name was Mike."}
{"text":"Forgive me for writing yet ANOTHER review so quickly after my last one, but I really gotta take BRGR down a star. I came here with my friend for his birthday and actually, this time, our service was pretty great, which was a nice surprise from last time. However, last time my burger was just a bit overcooked, and this time it was very overcooked (I always order rare). What happened here? The burgers used to be red and juicy and so good! The truffled cheese whiz hasn't tasted quite as truffley as usual these last two times either. And like I said previously, the fries are totally forgettable. So tragic! Get it together, BRGR!

And the kicker? After eating, we continued to chat for a while while I finished my sangria (which, albeit being basically just spiced wine, was pretty delicious). It was a Sunday and I guess they close early. Well, at about 9:45, maybe about 5 or 10 minutes after the last party before us left the restaurant, a man decked out in a suit whom I can only imagine to be the owner approached our table and said, direct quote, \"We're closing. You guys need to leave.\" and walked away. So rude. SO EFFING RUDE! No \"Thank you for dining with us,\" no \"Hope you enjoyed your meal,\" not even a casual \"Hey, just to let you guys know, we're closing in a few minutes.\" I've had bad waitresses, bad hostesses, but never in my life have I been treated this rudely by management! Oh yeah, and as we were saying our goodbyes outside the door, he popped his head out and looked us in the eye like an evil demon as he turned the lock on the door. WTF? Did he think we were going to try to get back in or something? It was totally creepy.

I don't know how I feel about this place now. I used to love coming here since it's a block away from my apartment, but now I'm kind of over it. I was always a bigger fan of BRGR than Burgatory, but I might be switching allegiances. Or I'll just go to Winghart's...why do I even bother with these other places again?"}
{"text":"I'll give this place 4 stars but 3.5 (the average) is about right.  This is an electic burger place that shares a kitchen with the upscale SPOON restaurant. We like it as a place to take visitors (at work and family visiting from out of town) because most people can find something to like here.  If you are vegetarian or pescatarian, there are reasonable options.  The setting is casual and the food comes quickly even when the place is busy.  The food is good not amazing and a little on the pricy side for what you get.   My kids like the shakes here."}
{"text":"Long story short, this place sucks and we got food poisoning. 

PROS
-Waitstaff was great and patient, and I loved the cool outfits a couple of them wore. 
-The rooftop patio is ace. Decent size, comfortable, airy( hey I've been to some stuffy patios before) 

CONS
-it takes a lot of walking to get the patio. So if you're elderly or have bad knees/joints/etc forget it
-small food selection. It's like a mini, crappier Burgatory. 
-It wasn't even busy and the food came quick but it was cold. The cheese was congealed. The meat flavorless and grainy. Not fresh whatsoever! Seems like they were cleaning out the refrigerator. I'm over this place. 
-you don't get chips or fries with your cold, over priced,  flavorless sandwich. 

BONUS ROUND
-me and my friends all got food poisoning the last time we went. So, nope not coming here ever again."}
{"text":"Seems like reviews for BRGR are quite mixed. I was pretty happy with the food and service though; it probably helped that it wasn't so busy on a Sunday afternoon. I really like the setup of the place, being both festive and casual at the same time. Our waiter got us seated and our orders taken pretty quickly, and the food came out shortly after. 

I don't think the burgers here are that much pricier than elsewhere, although I guess one reason might be that they do not come with a side by default. I'm not too sad about the lack of side though, as the burgers are pretty heavy already. I found mine very juicy (got the one with the short rib strips), with a large tender patty draped with cheese and onions. I feel that this can hold its own against Wingharts (and personally I may even prefer BRGR)."}
{"text":"Was at BRGR last night and the atmosphere is good but the product needs work especially when you compare it to Burgatory.  A couple of items to consider.  1. Revamp your appetizer menu.  Zucchini and mushrooms were greasy and the zucchini was too thin.  It was all breading.  2. Improve your wine selection.  Pint Grigio from Georgia with a twist top is not a good choice to serve.  3. Improve service training. Sitting at the bar and getting water was good but waiting 10 minutes and watching others get orders before us is frustrating.  

Overall the experience was ok, but I'm not sure I would be compelled to come back."}
{"text":"We came to the galleria for dinner but weren't really sure where to eat since there's so many options! We saw two seats at the bar in BRGR so here we went. It took a while for a bartender to grab us menus or drinks, but I think we just happened to sit down in a few of the busiest moments of the night.

Once the bartenders saw us, they took great car of us. We started off with two beers since they had a GF beer for me! Then we ordered burgers. I can't even remember what my other half ordered since I was drooling over my El Gaucho Verde burger. I couldn't decide between two but the bartender steered me toward the Gaucho and he steered me right.

The burger was perfectly topped with alfalfa sprouts and other deliciousness. The sauce was just perfect. I'll certainly be ordering this burger again! We also ordered a sauce of the house made sauce, but we didn't like the \"secret sauce\", so we ended up dipping them in ranch.

To any gluten free people, they are very knowledgeable and have lots of options here. I'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Brgr... you are trendy in some of the worst ways, but I love your food.  

Brgr does two out of the four things listed here: http://theoatmeal.com/blog/restaurant_popular

It has an obnoxious name, and they refuse to do substitutions.  Why? What will make it SOOOO hard for your cooks to change it up a little bit? It's just offensive.  Brgr, you are a stubborn restaurant.

However, the food is great.  The fries leave a little to be desired, but the burgers definitely don't.  And the spiked shakes? Oh lawdy yes.  They're crazy expensive, but SO DELICIOUS.

Brgr is a place to go.  I just wish they'd drop the obnoxious name and the flexibility issues."}
{"text":"We got seated without a wait. The service was great from start to finish. We had lunch type food, a giant chili dog, burger and onion rings.."}
{"text":"Pregamed before David Byrne last night. Just wanted to thank Jason for being a great bartender.  Thanks man!"}
{"text":"Went there Friday night , for dinner and drinks and I was definitely impressed. The place has a nice atmosphere with a nice decor. The service was good, fast and the waitress spent a lot of time suggesting us drinks suited to our requirements.
We tried the \"Paris 66\" and the \"Michelada\" for drinks. The fries were really nice! 
I ordered the black bean burger, and I thought it tasted nice, cooked well and was juicy too. It was a pretty big portion for me, and I couldn't really finish my burger :) But overall, I am not a big fan of burgers but would probably go there again when I am craving for a burger :)"}
{"text":"One of the BEST burgers I have ever tasted. The meat was perfectly cooked and so juicy, and the sauce was amazing. The fries were also perfectly cooked with a delicious sauce. The atmosphere was nice as well. HiIGHLY recommended!"}
{"text":"It's amazing how much the Bartending staff would rather sneak wine out of kid cups and chat and dance than actually serve paying customers who would tip."}
{"text":"5 stars for their new meatless burger. Holy deliciousness!! I have eaten at brgr a few times and gotten their falafel burger but it was always so dense that I had a hard time ever finishing one. Not the case today! The \"impossible\" burger is basically a seitan-esque burger that looks and tastes almost identical to a real burger. So close in fact, I looked at it and got scared. It was sooooo delicious and juicy. The inventors found the thing in meat that gives it it's color and texture and derived it. 

Anyway, I had it on the fire in the hole burger, which has guac, jalapeños, sriracha, pepper jack and chipotle aioli. It's spicy and perfect with this impossible burger. While you're there, check out the fries with truffle cheese wiz. Incredible taste! Also, this downtown location has the coolest interior. There's enormous chandeliers that look like they are made from shed antlers."}
{"text":"Love the food but servers move soooo slow, like it's a fashion show and do not take accountability of the restaurant.  I've been here a few times and the service overall can be better.  We sat on a very dirty table and asked a server if the table can possibly be wiped.  She says \"oh I don't know what that is... It's ok\".  Well, it's food.  And no it's not really ok, mainly because it only shows lack of accountability.  Then we sat for almost 15 mins til we got a menu coz servers forgot we were even there.  No system, bad customer service."}
{"text":"I've been to BRGR a few times now and really wish I could give it more stars but it's just not quite there yet. The burgers are okay--I've had the mushroom burger and the jalapeno one--and the shakes are decent but nothing exciting. I do like the ambiance, especially the outdoor patio up top, and the location is super convenient for an East Ender like me, but I think I'd rather make the longer drive to Burgatory next time I'm in the mood for this kind of fare."}
{"text":"I had the Tree Hugger burger.  This was hands-down the BEST veggie burger I've ever had.  Most restaurants just slap a Morningstar patty on a bun, but Brgr obviously took the time to craft a vegetarian option that rivals the meat burgers.  It is a lentil/falafel burger, with hot and sour cucumbers (nice touch!), tomato, pickled red onion, and goat's milk yogurt.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Um...YUM!

A bit pricey for a burger, but great atmosphere, and great taste.  Their fries are delicious, as are their shakes.  

I would definitely recommend this place if you're a burger lover."}
{"text":"Messy burger, not particularly memorable. Ok in a pinch but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Slow night here, quick service .... but a appetizer shall still come first and not with the main course - good food , great milkshake - recommend the food and the fries pickles !!!!"}
{"text":"Although the burgers and fries are very flavorful, mine were cold.  I had the bacon burger which comes with lettuce and tomato, but the coldness was not from the vegetables. The fries were cold and limp. I was here early, about an hour before the start of the game. So they either served yesterdays's food or they cooked it hours before the game. This is simply unacceptable for a burger and fries that cost $19.25 together. I would have taken them back, but I carried them up to the Pittsburgh Baseball Club and figured by the time I got back downstairs, they'd say it was my fault. These items hadn't cooled off. They were cold."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a no no for a hamburger lovert
The place is nice but the hamburgers were so tasteless 
Nothing like I expected. The bun served cold and not great taste either. On top the hamburger shows as $14 or so and then of course you have to add french fries for $4 so almost a $20 dollar burger!? If it was tasty and delicious ok but it's not. Will not be back. there are much better hamburgers in the burgh!"}
{"text":"Nice place if you want to try something different on your burger.  The burgers don't come with fries, but the burger is nicely portioned and pretty filling.  Relaxed atmosphere with tvs in the ceiling corners.  The main level space is relatively on the smaller side, I think, but they can still accommodate a group of 6+ people.  I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Consistently stellar burgers, fries and shakes. Everything is extremely fresh and the service is good too."}
{"text":"My review will not differ too drastically from other reviewers', and that's a shame. I was expecting so much more from BRGR after hearing all the hype, and particularly after witnessing friends get in arguments over which customizable burger establishment is better, BRGR or Burgatory. For me, the answer is clear, and sadly, that answer is Burgatory. 

I was in with a friend visiting from out of town, so we kept it simple since we had a lot of catching up to do. Nothing beats being able to eat a burger with one hand and gesture with the other (hey, good friends let good friends talk with their mouths full). I ordered the Double Yoi burger, which if you know anything about Pittsburgh, is an aptly-named tribute to Myron Cope that echoes a Primanti Brothers' sandwich. It came with pastrami, thousand island dressing, cole slaw, and the part I was looking forward to most, the egg on top. 

When you go to a nice burger joint and you get an egg on top, nothing beats cutting or biting into it and seeing or feeling the extravagant hot yolk drip down the sides. That's what I was expecting. I am doing the low-carb thing, so in my case I ordered it without the bun, and I was ready to see that glorious yolk cascade down my giant stack of meat. 

WAY disappointed. It was practically over-hard! OVER-HARD! NO yolk drippage at all. I was almost offended. And, on top of it, my medium well burger was cold in the middle. The pastrami was dried out. I understand cooking temperatures well enough to know that a medium well burger shouldn't be icy in the middle. I know from being a line cook, too, that that means my food was probably sitting at the expo station for way too long under a heat lamp. 

Neither my friend or I specifically communicated to our waitress that we would like our order of chips with 'crack dip' (I'll touch on that in a moment) to come out first, but it IS an appetizer, and to me, she should have at least asked. She did not, and I was a surprised when our food, which already took quite a while to leave the kitchen, came out with the chips side by side. It could have been handled better. 

So back to the 'crack dip.' I spent $4.25 on a basket of fresh fried chips that I shouldn't have eaten (which WERE delicious, crisp, and salty) just to try the 'crack dip' that comes with it. Our waitress explained that it's a to-die-for item, and it's reminiscent of a chili-cheese concoction. I think it has Sriracha in it too, so I was all on board. 

It came out in a 3 oz. souffle' cup haphazardly tucked under some chips. It tasted like a combination of CheezWhiz and canned chili you can get at the dollar store. Sadly, I was not impressed for the second time that evening. 

All in all, BRGR does have a lot going for it. It has a fun, unique menu with lots of add-ons and many ways to customize your burger. The decor is beautiful and welcoming. The wait was less than expected. The staff was pretty friendly. 

I fully understand that sometimes you go to a place and they're having a busy night. Things go wrong. I've worked in a kitchen for years, believe me, I know how that is. But I can't help but feel that everything was so lackluster that I wouldn't want to spend the time, money, and effort of driving to the South Hills to try it again. I'll be sticking to Burgatory for my burger needs from now on."}
{"text":"Taste: excellent. The turkey burger on wheat had sprouts, roasted tomato, special mayo, and cheese. It was really good for a bird. Malt shake, great! Soooo sweet, no dessert needed. The parmesean fries are gross, just some cheap fries w cheese ontop. Waste of $5

Service: mediocre. My waiter was nice (and cute) but the hostess was a c*nt. 

Price: ridiculous. The burger was good, but $25 for a burger fries and shake is crazy, especially for shittsburgh. I've never paid that much even in Chicago. They do give a discount for movie stubs.

Parking: pain in the butt. 

Overall, my experience was alright, but unfortunately the negatives (price, parking) slightly outweigh the positives."}
{"text":"Quite crowded on a Friday night, but that's expected... yes? 

Drinks were decent. I'd recommend the Dark & Stormy, which tastes like a Gummy Cola. I ordered the P450 (or something) with grapefruit, and I didn't like it. It tasted... funky. I also ordered the Little Bloody, which was fun to drink. A shot of tequila, a shot of spicy tomato juice, and a can of Tecate. I felt pretty damn cool. 

Service was good, considering my group was getting a bit drunk and rowdy. 

Fried pickles were delicious, and they were my favorite order of the night. I almost ditched my burger to order another round of pickles, but I'm glad I didn't. My burger was good. Grilled cheese bites were nothing special. 

Conclusion? Get the Dark & Stormy and Fried Pickles. You're welcome."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  I stopped in here on a whim during my walk home last night, and I really hadn't heard anything about it.  I was initially underwhelmed.  Somehow I thought the name Brgr was in homage to the city of Pittsburgh. I wasn't really in the mood for a Burger, and there simply isn't anything else on the menu except a $9 cobb salad and $6 chili.  I had the chili, it was quite tasty, but nothing too unseen.  Beer prices are expensive for Pittsburgh, rail drinks are more respectable.  The saving grace was my friendly service.

But PLEASE, for the love of pete, if you are going to charge $4 for a Yuengling and $9-25 for a burger with no sides you can afford to hire a graphic designer for your logo!"}
{"text":"We had a catered event by BRGR in the top deck of the restaurant this week and I have to say it was really nice! The deck is pretty and has a nice view of the church and city. 
They had a variety of half burgers from the menu available. Because they were half burgers you have the opportunity to try a few different burgers. They also served their special crack dip ( it's a chili-esque, thin dip) served with tortillas. My favorite part was the potato salad. It's filled with fresh dill, and absolutely delish!
The only improvement I would suggest is that they don't have capabilites to have a full bar upstairs. Soooo, they had to climb up and down the stairs to get drinks and it took forever...."}
{"text":"When you order a gluten free bun and not get it. It makes your night not a very pleasant night. 
I'm new to having to eat gluten free, and I said to my wife \"hey these gluten free buns look pretty good\". Then of course when the bill comes there's no $2 up charge for gluten free bun. 
You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to know I didn't get gluten free. 
So I'd like to thank Nicole & BRGR before I'll have to spend my whole Friday night by a toilet."}
{"text":"I finally got my fried pickles! Brgr is bustling with the young professional crowd. Clean modern decor with booths and swirling metallic wall art, a place to mingle with friends, and dim lighting that always adds an air of privacy.

We arrived around 6:30pm on a Saturday evening, I was prepared for open tables but we were put on the, hold for it... 1hour wait! Wow! Isn't Brgr Pop pop pop POPULAR. We decided to wait for the rest of our party and have a seat at the bar. The beer selection is interesting, I had a Guinness draft, usually my beer of choice because it is supposed to be the \"Healthy beer\" right? Plus it tastes great with savory grilled burgers!

The rest of our party was running late so when they came to get us and they had not yet arrived they kept us at the top of the list. We struck up a conversation with the bartender while we people watched. One of the managers was walking around like he was some sort of FBI agent. He was Intense and had us giggling! 

John was the bartender, formerly from Ceviche downtown, so so happy to run into him because he makes a mean Caipirinha. Best in the burgh that I have tried. When warmer weather roles around I'll be packing my sugar in the Raw packets(they only have simple syrup at Brgr...Ick) and caling ahead to see if John is there to muddle me that tart, exhilarating summer drink.

The couple we were meeting are great friends of the executive Chef so we were sat instantly and ordered right away. I had the fried pickles as my starter. They came out in a short metal cup. They come with 2 pickles one big, one small. Hmm not very impressive. I took a photo. My 1st fried pickle experience didn't have me begging for more. I let everyone sample them and our couple ordered them too. I thought the grease in the batter was slightly off. 

My Brgr knocked my socks off! Wow really bees knees! Juicy, tender, with the hint of that smokey char grilled taste. Braised beef short ribs on the \"Button Buster\" white cheddar, crispy onion perfection. Fries sold separately, they have a truffle cheese wiz and a truffle aioli (the aioli not on the menu) that had me licking my fingers! Must have!

Our friends had the Kobe beef brgr and next time I would like to try, possibly with fois gras! Interesting. 

For dessert I sampled the Chocolate Covered Cherry shake, it tastes exactly like those old time chocolates given to grandma. I was so full that I had no room for dessert! 

I can't wait to bring J and sit on the rooftop patio! 

Notes: Valet parking $3, Get there early because it's busy, ask for separate checks beforehand because they didn't want to split them afterward"}
{"text":"We like this place a lot, but today we learned a couple items to steer clear of. 

No on the chicken and waffles, and no on the death by chocolate milk shake. 

The chicken was dry, the waffles were cold and tasteless, and the best part of the shake was the chocolate ice cream.

Stick with the burgers & regular chocolate shake."}
{"text":"Decided to check out their 'keto' offerings since they are not far from my home.

I decided on a BYO burger - grass fed beef, pepper jack cheese, garlic aioli, mushrooms, and onions on a lettuce wrap.  The (iceberg) lettuce bun was plentiful and tightly secured with a long toothpick. I did enjoy this burger, but thought the patty could use a bit more seasoning & more mushrooms (I only found 2 small mushroom slices on my burger). It was also a bit costly at $14 after I added the toppings- I think some toppings, like sliced onion, sliced tomato, or pickle slices (pickles aren't listed as a topping choice oddly) should be free toppings because the burger itself is already upwards of $10 with no toppings.

Instead of fries or chips, I got a half portion of Greek salad- it was very good and a nice bowl portion. It had feta cheese, Kalimantan olives, cucumbers, sliced banana peppers, and tomatoes.  I really enjoyed the Greek dressing, though it was very sweet!

The waiter was on top of everything and very friendly.  I would be back again to treat myself whilst staying on track with my diet!"}
{"text":"When I went to BRGR, I got The Button Buster. I'll have to say, I was pretty excited because this looked like an awesome burger. However, I was a little disappointed. The braised short ribs on top of the burger were quite fatty and unappetizing. I took off the remaining short ribs and finished more of the burger. I wish that it would have come with a side as well. Overall, if I go here again I will definitely get a different burger."}
{"text":"I went to Brgr tonight and had the \"Fire in the Hole\" Burger.  All in all it was really good - I did occasionally taste a salmon flavor.  So I assumed that perhaps someone that had recently made the salmon burger was assembling my burger.  But other than that it was really good - it was medium well as I requested and it was spicy which was a plus.  I ate the whole thing and enjoyed every bite, other than the salmon tasting ones - which were about 4 bites.  

You have to order fries separately which I did, and shared with the people I was with.  The fries were crisp and perfectly seasoned to my taste.  

I would recommend this place.  I'm glad I checked it out."}
{"text":"Seriously, what restaurant serves lunch but doesn't open until 11:30?  Posted at 11am from parking spot in front of restaurant :( Sad trombone."}
{"text":"We somehow end up going to BRGR when we're in the area and Abbay is closed or something. We can't do it too often because they have only one veggie burger which is a hit or a miss. 

 I like that it's low key enough to make you feel comfortable but be warned that the ambiance is fairly yuppie."}
{"text":"Contrary to other reviews.  Our server was great and the time to wait (30 min) was almost exact.  A 30 min wait on a Friday night was not a bad thing.  I can not say anything about the beer, but the appetizer we got (egg roll based) was flavorful and hot.  The burgers arrive quickly and were tasty.  We got them with stuff on them and the toppings were plentiful and tasty.  I was disappointed in the fries - just frozen type, dressed up.  I am a fry lover, but my husband liked them.  Not our favorite burger place, but we will go back when in the area."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had some of the appetizers, quality food. The service was very slow, seemed like there were a lot of servers standing around! All around good experience. Will go back."}
{"text":"This place is terribly overpriced for the quality of food you get. I was super f*ckin stoked to get a big ass delicious burger while running so errands today, but I chose this place. It's basically McDonald's fries with oversized bland stake n' shake burgers. 
Our waiter seemed to not give a sh*t.  I had to find silverware and napkins on my own after our appetizer was delivered. After we were done eating, we waited for our check, watched a bit of hockey, waited some more. Finally I just went to the bar and asked to pay for my meal. 
The cheapest burger is 9 bucks, it doesn't come with a side. So be prepared for $15+ for shitty food."}
{"text":"Went here expecting to get a really tasty burger.  And sadly it was just OK.  Nothing really special about the Shroomz burger in the flavor department.  However, I really did like that they had a great beer selection and I would be willing to go back and try a few different things on their menu as they seem creative.  However, keep in mind, this place is no In-n-Out Burger or even a Ruby's Diner."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went on a Saturday night just because we were hungry and in the area. It wasn't the worst experience we've ever had, but neither of us would ever go back or go out of our way to suggest it to really anyone who would ask our opinion(s). 

PROS: Pretty good burgers, temp well maintained, chairs were comfortable, tons of TVs if that's what you're into, solid selection of liquors, sleek/modern design that I really liked, decent amount of seating for parties of 3 or less for quick seating.

CONS:
-SMALL!
-Although we only had a party of 2 it took almost 5mins to get a seat because whoever the guy up front was couldn't find either of his hostesses in the restaurant that was barely bigger than your average local drugstore.
-It took almost another 5mins just to get waters we didn't ask for and get blown off by our server for another 3mins until we could place a drink order.
-Despite the full bar and 2-3 bartenders it took 10mins to get drinks and place our food order. Also, a top shelf baybreeze (Belvedere, pineapple, and cranberry juice) somehow cost $12 which is absurd even for a restaurant.
-The chips with \"crack sauce\" we ordered was terrible. The chips tasted like they were baked lays from a bag, refried in old peanut oil. And the \"crack sauce\" tasted like tostitos cheese sauce with chili powder or maybe taco seasoning.

Once we had our food we didn't ask for much because we figured we'd be done eating by the time any of it actually came, so there weren't many opportunities to screw up, but somehow we were left with only 2 napkins for our meal despite asking twice. The only reason they're getting 2 stars instead of 1 is because everyone we dealt with was actually really nice.

My biggest warning would be for those in parties of 4 or more or even smaller parties that show up too late: There are only 3-5 designated 4 seat tables, and then there's this enormous L-shaped booth seat with small, 2-person tables. There are literally maybe 18\" maximum between each table and there are the designated bigger tables in the not-so-open space next to that mass. Extremely crowded. To the point that if I were to go back I'd call and try to reserve a tall table, and if they couldn't accommodate I'd just take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Our waitress was friendly, and the fries were delicious. My burger was so so, and the beer selection was kinda disappointing. Overall, I gotta say Burgatory is more worth the money."}
{"text":"Paid 60 dollars for two burgers, three milkshakes, and fries and cheese. This included tip. Service was okay. The burgers were not very flavorful. We were really excited to try it, but left disappointed. We won't be back. I'm an avid cook and make much better burgers at home."}
{"text":"It was a really nice Saturday afternoon here in the 'Burgh, this spring has yet to be nice, so I was taking advantage of the nice weather and having a meal out where I could eat al fresco. BRGR came to mind, I have passed by this place and knew they lifted the garage style door on nice days, and sure enough it was opened. 

My big complaint with this location is parking, DO NOT park in the garage located across the street from BRGR, you will be towed, signs clearly mark read \"parking for East side only\", BRGR is on the west side.....* grumble* I found street parking, and put 4 quarters in the meter, yes meters are watched on Saturdays!

Forget everything I've said about bland, boring, fall apart vegan burgers, BRGR has got it right, and wow, with a burst of great flavor. I had the Tree Hugger, awesome name and very flavorful! A falafel style burger that came on a baguette with pickled cucumber, roasted red pepper, and tomato. Delish, and Jamie, fellow vegetarian friend of Joe, had the tree hugger as well, only he had it with the parmesan fries (4 bucks al a cart) which he said were outrageously good. I had my burger with the best cole slaw (3 bucks al a cart) ever, very course cut cabbage with golden raisins, celery seed, carrots, caraway seed, and a wonderful sweet vinegar slaw dressing that makes primanti bros slaw seem like swill. The falafel burger goes great with any of the IPA's they offer on draft. Something about an IPA with the flavors of cumin, indescribably good. 

The decor is awesome, this place would look great in NYC, San Fran, LA, or any big city, but I'm happy they are here. Very big city looking without being snobby.

Well, after eating eating here, this totally throws my burger loyalty out the window, BRGR is my restaurant of choice now!"}
{"text":"This place is just average. It's hard to make a bad burger, so it's not like you can go wrong eating here, but it also isn't going to be memorable or your new favorite burger spot. I do like though that they have the option to put your burger in a lettuce wrap. I'll also mention that I was trying to be healthy when I went here by ordering a lettuce wrapped turkey burger, so I'm sure their other burgers would have more flavor."}
{"text":"Best burger and shake I have ever had. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. I kept it simple with the dbl meat dbl cheese and a spiked Salty Caramel shake. Awesome!"}
{"text":"A good burger joint, like the others.  The meat is very fresh as well as the toppings. Great atmosphere! They were my favorite until they changed their french fries.  I LLLLLOVED the crunchy long skinny fries, now they are thicker with what appears to be a coating. I won't be in as big of a rush to go back."}
{"text":"Very good burger considering location in between mountains ...overall not bad at all servers do not chat with you. First time in Pittsburg and like the meal! Con had to pay $10parking no parking except garage"}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty awesome, but I feel like we managed to come at a perfect moment, just before the mad rush that forced people to wait for an hour, while I luxuriated like Caesar on a comfy couch stuffing my face with delight.  Waiting anywhere sucks, and BRGR doesn't have quite enough room to fit the herd of people that were forced to wait in the cramped entry way.  I imagine if I had to wait an hour for a burger, I'd be inclined to bitch about the font choice on the sign as well.  But as I said, we had to wait for about three minutes for our glorious table.  As the sign would suggest, this place is primarily a burger joint, though it does have an excellent bar.  I'd recommend the Button Buster for your burger, and a Scotty Karate beer to accompany.  The addition of flat screens doesn't really seem to fit in with the rest of decor.  For the most part, it seems to be striving for a high end, jacket required type of restaurant, and on the other hand, you can watch women's basketball.  Service was very good for how busy it ended up getting, with a special shout out to the animated male host who was our initial welcome into the joint.  Recommended for a group of four or more.  Don't take a first date there.  We watched several awkward couples trying to politely wrap their mouths around gargantuan burgers.  OH!  And try an alcoholic milkshake, because, we're all going to die from something, and it might as well be from a novelty drink."}
{"text":"I ate here for dinner last Thursday evening with a companion.  The decor of the restaurant was nice and seemed industrial as it was probably a warehouse previously.  They also had TV's positioned conveniently all over the restaurant so that every seat was able to see one.

I was pleasantly surprised whenever I opened up the menu as we had been planning on visiting the Cranberry location but ended up switching to the East Liberty one at the last minute.  The East Liberty menu has a nice list of unusual burgers while the Cranberry one seems to be a make your own, much like the Burgatory.  For dinner I decided on the Thai Pork and Shrimp Burger while my dining partner decided on the Shrooms Burger and we got an order of fries and fried pickles on the side.  The shrooms burger had a nice taste and the mushrooms added some earthiness while the Pork and Shrimp burger was nice also although I am not so sure where the Thai part of the name came in.  The fries were crispy and cooked to a nice temperature while the fried pickles were also good although disappointing in serving size.  

The bottom line for me is that the food was decent and reasonably priced so I would come back to BRGR in the future.  I am not sure that it would be the first sit down burger joint on my list but the food was good enough."}
{"text":"My bf and I visited BRGR during the day; we chose to sit on the rooftop deck (nice feature) because the dining room is too dark, kinda blah. We were seated, there were fries under the table and chairs, not very clean. It seems anymore that a waitress not being hostile is the new 'nice'. Very hip attitude, not very talkative.

I ordered a burger for 10$, but that does not come with sides.The food came out very quick; which isn't always a good thing because I go out so that I can sit and relax for a little while, not just eat and get the hell out the door! The burger wasn't bad, but certainly nothing special, and definitely not worth the price. The beef was cooked well, but I dont think they used any seasoning, the cheese tasted like cheap flavorless cheese. Of note; neither the fries or onion rings are homemade :(

The place is ok, but doesn't live up to it's name BRGR. I was expecting a damn good burger!

BURGATORY is much much much better. The food is better, sides are homemade, and the selection of burgers is way bigger and they have a 'make your own burger' menu."}
{"text":"BRGR is the new \"gourmet burger\" bistro opened by the owners of Spoon Pittsburgh. 

The menu focuses, as you'd guess from the name, on burgers.  Not strictly limited to beef burgers, the place offers a variety of choices:  the turkey burger, for example, comes with green beans, stuffing, and cranberries, (\"It's a little too much like Thanksgiving on a plate\" said someone at my table).  There are salmon burgers, a lentil-based burger for vegetarians, a variety of beef choices, and at least one pork-based burger.

The pork-based alternative, the Banh Mi burger, was what I got.  A pork patty, pickled vegetables, and chicken liver paté, it reached (but did not go past) the limit of structural integrity.  It was creative, juicy, and I plan on going back for more.

Side dishes include french fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings, as well as coleslaw and a few other alternatives.  I'll follow up to this review once I've tried more of them.  The fries and onion rings were both excellent, and a side-order easily feeds more than one person. 

Price-wise, you're looking at $7 - $9 (on average) per burger, plus a few bucks for a side dish.  This means you can go with a few friends, split a side dish and get in and out for around $10.  That's a good deal.  The drinks, particularly the alcoholic ice-cream shakes, can fatten up your bill like a corn-fed cow, costing around $8 each.  A friend of mine had one, and while they're not to my taste - I don't go for sweet drinks generally - they're fine examples of the booze-and-ice-cream category.

Criticisms: at least on the first day, when we ordered onion rings ahead of time they politely informed us that \"everything comes out of the kitchen at the same time.\"  That rule is not going to last long, especially if they expect people to be ordering drinks from their bar.  Hopefully they'll also realize it's a bit off-putting to be told you'll get your food on their schedule instead of yours.

I also deducted a point for their having a \"Kobe beef burger\" on the menu.  Come on, guys.  Your menu is strong enough without needing to engage in that sort of make-believe.  

These criticisms, however, are fairly picayune.  The core message here is: they nail the gourmet burger bistro thing, they can execute on the food, and I plan on dining there often."}
{"text":"Guys, guys, guys. This was just a huge miss. Came in with some friends on Saturday evening around 8 or so. There were 4 other people in the restaurant, on a Saturday, for dinner. Anyway, it started off well, everyone was extremely kind. We came in after working out so tbh I can't remember what we all got because we were all just pretty hungry. 

Starter we ordered chips and crack dip. Decent
Then I ordered the Smokehouse Bison cooked medium. Came out cooked fully through and honestly it was super dry. Nothing about the burger stood out at all. Afterwards, everyone kinda all said the same thing. Burgers were bland and the condiments and added things on it didn't even make up for the actual burger. 

On the plus, I ordered the Death by Chocolate milkshake and it was really good!"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. Nice restaurant. Only one small gripe, iceberg lettuce, please replace with leaf lettuce. Recommended."}
{"text":"Premium toppings and great customer service can't make up for a dry patty 

I ordered the turkey burger called California Lovin' at the PNC Park location during a Pittsburgh Pirates game. 
It was topped with avacado, Provolone cheese, pesto mayo, roasted tomatoes and alfalfa sprouts. 

The turkey patty was so dry that it really needed all those toppings to add moisture as well as flavor. I particularly enjoyed the pesto. Avacado always has a way of sliding out of sandwiches and this was no exception. This was a messy sandwich eating experience...don't forget to grab some napkins! 

The customer service was warm and came with a smile and that was the highlight of the experience.

I won't be purchasing from the PNC Park location of BRGR again."}
{"text":"The manager and wait staff offered us free appetizers and first round of drinks. This was a nice gesture to make up for the scheduling mistake. Food was good also."}
{"text":"The East Liberty location is much better.  I've found the service and preparation lacking at the Galleria location."}
{"text":"I came into BRGR for a team lunch. The staff was friendly and attentive and seated us right away. Even though it was about 1230, there didn't seem to be a \"lunch rush\".

The food of those with me was only mildly warm by the time it got to the table.

I ordered the Niçoise Salad was I was pretty disappointed with. The green beans were canned, the olives were sad, and the tuna was tuna salad

 Next time I'm sticking with a burger."}
{"text":"I had the Kobe burger and vanilla milkshake. Both were phenomenal - the burger was cooked to perfection (medium for me).  Our table shared all three types of fries - also delicious.  I also love that they serve soda from Natrona Bottling Company - it is nice to see local businesses on the menu."}
{"text":"Dinner Thursday night February 8 was fantastic. From the hostess, Nadia, to Alison and all of the wait staff, service was friendly and attentive. Mez Around was a creative, flavorful cocktail, the chili was some of the best I've had in 20 years in western PA, the bison burger and chips were their usual standouts. I tried the pierogi for the first time and it was great - perfect pillowy pockets and delicious short ribs (I got the cheese sauce on the side). Delivery from the kitchen was not optimum - mains served too soon after appetizers, some tables seemed to have lengthy waits. They were trying to serve a packed pre-theater crowd so I understand the challenge but would have deducted half a star if possible."}
{"text":"Ate here after a Pirates game. Restaurant was easy to find and close to PNC Park. Food was tasty only complaint was everything was very salty! Like extremely salty I was dying of thirst after. Waitress was fast, restaurant was clean, portions were decent size. I recommend the wings/fries and the Mac n cheese."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to eat here and I'm pleased. The burger itself was probably the best tasting burger I've had in town. I got it well done and it wasn't burnt to a crisp or dried out. I like the bread they use. I requested crispy bacon and they did not disappoint. I believe there were 3 slices of bacon too, a lot of places skimp and only give you two. My only gripe was the white cheddar cheese I got was bland...I might request an extra slice next time.

The fries were nothing to write home about, and not really worth $4 extra IMO. I'll try the onion rings next time. I got a salted caramel (non-alc) milkshake and it was pretty amazing (thanks to Dave & Andy's ice cream) and plenty big enough to share. Our service was very friendly. The decor is great.

My only major dislike of the place is that they say no substitutions or additions to their burgers. The recipes all sound great, but I'm a rather picky person. My husband had the Shrooms burger, but he thinks it would be great with blue cheese instead of brie. Well, no can do. There's nothing wrong with having unique recipes that you don't want to mess with, but I think if you're going to do that you should also have an a la carte, build your own burger option.

I likely won't come back again on a Sunday afternoon though because there were way too many kids in here. Why do people bring their kids here? Come on, it's expensive. Go to Applebee's or something so we adults can enjoy a nice adult atmosphere. Good grief."}
{"text":"We came here again this week for a team dinner, and since the California Lovin' Burger had been changed to a Thanksgiving-ish burger, I opted for the Kobe Beef Burger, which was good. Still, I was secretly missing the avocado :)

We also grabbed some yummy truffle fries for an appetizer, and also tried the Texas Toast Grilled Cheese nibs, which were good. Perhaps I should have worked in a salad... lots of fried food!

BRGR is a solid restaurant - if you're into burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Okay the 3.5 stars that BRGR has is DEAD on.  So I'm going to jack it up with 4 stars....apologies.  I give snaps for a yummy Kobe Beef burger, great price, fast service and cool vibe.  Going to have to remove a couple for a single bathroom per gender (what small bladdered planet do you come from?! The place is half bar!!)
Apparently when you ask \"The burger doesn't come with any mayo or anything on it, does it?\" and they say, \"No.  No mayo\"  It is code for 'we will now slather both sides of your burger with mayo.  And while I love an edgy place, the reality is I have no doubt cool edgy 'chef' type would surely spit my a redo for someone whining about mayo, so there's that.
While I'm in favor of uplifting the neighborhood as much as the next suburbanite, the folks doing some low riding drive by's with their bass blaring makes it necessary to read the lips of the people you are with.  
A much needed funky joint and good vibe but don't bring the kids and run serpentine style back to your car if its after dark."}
{"text":"Today a friend and I arrived BRGR around 2:30 PM and after a minute of waiting, a server came up to us and said that there were people leaving a table and that it would be cleared so we could sit. There were about 4 servers on duty, and the place was pretty full, so that was totally fine. However, as I watched the server of the section near the windows walk by the table that was supposed to be cleared for us without doing ANYTHING about it a few times, I started to wonder if anyone was going to clear it. Finally, after 5 minutes of multiple servers continuously walking by the table and other servers literally just CHILLING near the hostess stand doing nothing, the busboy seemed to come out of nowhere (we hadn't seen him up until then), and cleared the table. 

Once the table was cleared, we expected someone to come bring us to our table. NOPE. Two servers, a tall guy and a young brunette, literally just stood there, occasionally looking at us, not saying anything. It was absolutely ridiculous. And just for the record, I have been a server at multiple restaurants so I know how hard of a job it is, and I understand why little things go wrong and don't stress out about them. But this was absurd. Like seriously, how are the servers (at least the ones we encountered today) at this restaurant so completely incompetent?! Anyway, we just turned around and left! Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"I've been to BRGR a few times now, and each time I walk away thinking that it should be called MLKSHK or APPTZR, because there's nothing good about their burgers, themselves.

I'm a big fan of the salty caramel milkshake with bourbon, and the fried pickles are really good, but everything else that I've ever tried has always fallen flat, from the ahi burger...to a regular burger...to the sante fe hippie veggie burger. I've tried REALLY hard to be impressed, but it's just not happening. The buns are dry, the burgers are overpriced, and the flavors are simply lacking the interest to justify going back. If I'm paying a premium price for an a la carte burger, there are better establishments in Pittsburgh to choose from.

Not to mention, the beer prices at BRGR are laughable. $7 for a Strongbow bottle? You've got to be kidding me. I guess they've got to get all the money out of you during your visit since the food isn't going to be bringing you back."}
{"text":"BRGR wishes it were Burgatory, but it's not.  And since they're basically at the same price point, why not just go to Burgatory instead?

The burgers, the toppings, the specials, the suggested combinations, and even the milkshakes (alcoholic and otherwise) are just slightly worse takes on an existing theme.  The food is just generally bland and unmemorable.  And one time everyone in my group got a stomach ache afterwards."}
{"text":"BRGR is fast becoming my favorite locally owned,burger place ever.Have had only enjoyable experiences there.Mark and Kristi at the bar couldn't have been more helpful,kind and professional.Sandy was great too,and they just got slammed with customers.We were treated so well,the food is absolutely one of the things you HAVE to try in your lifetime.I crafted my own,grass fed,bearnaise aioli,fresh mozzarella,bean,sprouts and mushrooms on a brioche and for me it was perfection.Great atmosphere,relaxed with family,just very cool vibe.I know there are other locations too,this one was the closest.And I want to say again,these guys  are locals !!Let's support them!So far,I only had my crafted one 2ce,but plan on going back and trying the Pad Thai burger,Grazed and Confused and some salads.Cannot go wrong with this place !!!Give them a try !You wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have always had a good experience at BRGR.  My boyfriend and I usually share our burgers with each other so I have tried a good amount of different burgers there.  I have had the Kobe Beef, Shrooms, Gobble Gobble, and I believe some sort of Asian inspired burger that they don't seem to have on their menu anymore.  Every burger I have had has been juicy and delicious. I always get a good medium or medium-rare piece of meat with great bread.  If you're really hungry, go for the Kobe.  Not only is it delicious, it is also huge!  I always get their perfectly cooked and crisped thin(ner) cut fries with the AMAZING truffle cheese whiz.  It is really what makes every trip great.  I don't think my meal at BRGR would be complete without the fries AND truffle cheese whiz.  It is so good it actually inspired me to go and try and make my own truffle cheese concoction at home!   But of course, it never comes out the same as BRGR's.  But I digress...  I wish I could write more about the place but almost everyone knows what a burger tastes like, right?  All I can say is that I will vouch for BRGR and think their burgers are pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"Sorry BRGR, 

I loved the atmosphere that BRGR had but the service and food were abysmal. 
The waitress brusquely took our order and seemed irritated of our mere presence.  We took the food togo to her delight and found that our medium burgers were seemingly fresh off the cow.  
I think that the burgers could have been delicious if given the time and would probably go to a different location.  The burgers were pretty expensive and I'm sad I had to waste our time there."}
{"text":"For someone who does not really enjoy the flavor of meat (I know either discredit this review or write me off as not-human), I've gone to BRGR a fair number of times because their hamburgers can be made so well! From my experiences their Average Joe burger is the classic lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, burger patty that really hits the spot whenever I crave a salty, medium-rare, juicy, delicious hunk of beef. I would say 3/4 of the time they grill the patties perfectly. On the side I often order onion rings. The batter is light, crispy, flavorful, and fairly light. 

Overall, the average joe is a burger that you cannot go wrong with! The only gripe I have is that some times they are not made consistently, and I sometimes end up eating a salty, meaty hunk of \"cardboard\" between two fluffy brioche buns with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and a pickle on the side. But again, the upside is that it happens less than the majority of times."}
{"text":"Treated ourselves to burgers and a shake. Hubby had the steakhouse burger, which was delicious, and I created a burger with white cheddar and pesto aoili. I think our only complaint was that our medium-well burgers were still noticeably pink in the center. That's part of the reason I didn't finish mine; the other is that I was full from splitting a peanut butter cup shake. Server was nice, and our food came out very quickly. Prices were reasonable. Next time we'll skip the shake and try the fries."}
{"text":"On a Saturday afternoon they can be busy, but  they have a neat app so you know how many parties are in front of you. The hostess will text you when your table is ready. After a short wait, we were seated. Although there is a sign in the wall \"There is nothing fast about a great burger,\" service and food were quick. Word to the wise: the bathrooms are downstairs and not handicapped accessible. The two of us split a shake, burger, and order of fries for about $25 including tip. That was just enough food, with a serving of fries we took home for leftovers. The strawberry shake was sweet and creamy. However, the average Joe burger was extremely average, even with white cheddar cheese. Needed mustard from one of the bottles on the table to be worth writing home about. This was our third trip to a BRGR, and although I prefer locally owned joints to chains, this one has enough quality and variety that we will likely be back."}
{"text":"+ Awesome burger menu.
+ Floats and shakes with booze! Get the pumpkin shake.
+ Fries with truffled cheese whiz!

- They don't understand what medium rare means. All of our burgers were medium / medium well :(
- Our waitress told me next time I should pay in cash because they don't have to claim their tips as income that way. Really? I lol'd."}
{"text":"Never have a bad meal. I always stick to just an average joe burger and chips with crack dip. Have tried other appetizers but didn't do it for me at all. Grilled cheese bites are not good. 

Button buster and fire in the hole are also very good. 

I like all of their milkshakes, but have been making them at home which are just as good!!!

Skip burgatory and go to BRGR. Like other reviewers, much homier and does not feel like a franchise when you walk in."}
{"text":"Ok so the burger I had was called Average Joe, but let me tell you nothing is average about this burger.... They have fancy cheese fries-Delicious!!! 
I have passed this place a million times and said look at those idiots sitting outside.... What is that place? Well I am glad to say I too am now a BrGr idiot"}
{"text":"The best burgers and shake creations!!! Great ambiance, welcoming and friendly service, good people-watching location. The foodies excellent!! The JBL speakers are clean!!! Goes down as a fav!"}
{"text":"I have been to BRGR 4 times.  The food is great and I was always recommending it and preferred it over Burgatory.  Our last visit, however, may be our last visit.  There were 4 of us - 2 of which were newbies and came on our recommendation.  All was good up until the very end.  We had paid our check and were sitting there chatting NO MORE THAN 5 minutes when our server informed us that they needed our table and requested that we leave.  Granted, we were offered a to-go milkshake but, in my opinion, that HARDLY makes up for the embarrassment and humiliation of being asked to leave a restaurant for ANY reason.  I would have certainly understood more if we had been sitting at our table for 20-30 minutes - but 5 minutes?  Really?  We will miss you BRGR - but I simply refuse to be treated that way no matter how busy you are.  And you weren't even all that busy.  Bottom-line - good burgers and food but they are more into turning tables over than making their customers feel valued or caring if they ever return."}
{"text":"Some coworkers and I came here for lunch last week, to order \"A burger, hold the vowels.\"  We were seated right away around noon on a weekday, but there was a pretty decent sized lunch crowd.  The door/window thing was open so we got a nice breeze - it can make it chilly if it isn't a warm day outside, so bring a sweater!

Our server was friendly, and was nice about waiting to take our order until our last friend came about 10 minutes later.  We desperately wanted alcoholic milkshakes, but stuck with water since we were on the clock - pity.  So we decided to split some side dishes, which came out first as appetizers.  We got the \"BRGR fries with truffle cheese whiz,\" and the \"Housemade chips with crack dip.\"  Yes, crack dip.  Apparently it does not contain real crack, so don't be afraid.

The sides were okay - I love French fries in all situations, but the \"truffle cheese whiz\" didn't add much to it.  I'm not really a big fan of processed cheese food, even if \"truffles\" are involved. I prefer plain old ketchup.  Fries were totally decent, with a little smattering of herbs and parmesan on top.  The potato chips were tasty and freshly fried, but the crack dip was essentially more cheese whiz, only this time they added sriracha instead of \"truffle.\"  It tasted pretty much the same to me as the truffle cheese whiz, and its neon-orange nacho cheese appearance was not really appealing.  So I say if you're getting sides, avoid anything with cheese.  Sides can easily be shared between several people - the four of us couldn't finish the chips and fries between us.

I'm being weird and healthy lately, so I decided not to get a regular beef burger.  I asked the server which was the best of the non-beef burgers, and he suggested the Asian-flavored tuna burger, aka the \"Love You Long Time.\"  Really?  Can't say if I was Asian I'd be a huge fan of that title (imagine ordering matzo ball soup and it being called \"big nose take all your money\" soup).  Anywaaaay, you can order it seared rare or cooked through - get it rare, tuna cooked all the way through is not yummy.  There's some avocado in there, also wasabi, sweet soy, pickled cucumber and daikon, and \"chili aioli\" which was a pretty creamy, somewhat spicy sauce.

It was all pretty good, had lots of flavor, but it was a bit heavy.  I guess I'd hoped for more sushi-on-a-bun, but the creamy sauce and somewhat messy toppings made the meal seem a bit rich.  Still, I ate most if it before I got full. Didn't think it was worth taking home.

The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and sunny.  I'd like to come back this summer for a boozy milkshake and a beef burger.  Oh, it's a wee bit pricey as well, I think the prices are better suited for dinner, so keep that in mind.  And watch out for the rcst brgrs."}
{"text":"This place had everything you want to have when going to a restaurant. Great and fast service, excellent food, and a cozy atmosphere. Their milkshakes were out of this world, along with the burgers. I have no complaints and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Plusses: Very good burgers. Nice blend of cuts, juicy and flavorful. Excellent onion rings. Had the \"Fire in the Hole\" which could have been a bit spicier for my taste, but was good. Excellent table service. 

Minuses: Way too loud, terrible/rude hostess on the day we went, hour long wait. They should knock down the wall and expand into Spoon. Tater tots kidney-failure salty."}
{"text":"Decent burgers. The meat was done well. The vegetarian burger was lacking in flavour, which isn't surprising. One portion of fries equals a huge bucket so be warned! Friendly staff."}
{"text":"It's very similar to Burgatory, but nowhere near as crowded and noisy. Good burgers, good onion rings, and friendly service."}
{"text":"It surprises me a little how much I like this place given my feelings for spoon. That said, I think they make good burgers and have a fantastic beer selection. During the hot hot heat of a pittsburgh summer, their deck is one of the best places you can be. My personal favorite item on the menus is the \"fire in the hole\" burger. But they're all good. Full disclosure: I'm hopelessly in love with burgers and lose all objectivity when talking about them."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a quick family dinner. I am always a fan of a good burger joint and BRGR totally fits the bill. This is a convenient location right inside of the Galleria and right down the hill from SHV Mall. I'm always a big fan of a Cease and Desist burger which is like a fancy big mac. I'd skip the milk shake and get the truffle cheese wiz fries."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times so far and every time it is just decent. You can make your own sandwiches with a ton of different topping choices which I enjoy. However, they do not have buffalo sauce as an option which blows my mind. Last time I made a chicken sandwich with coleslaw and an aioli as my topping. Pretty good! This time I went with the impossible burger. I have tried this once before at Burgatory and it was delicious. This one fell short for me though. It was very flat and not juicy at all, coming across more like a veggie patty. I do like that you can choose between different buns or a lettuce wrap which I went with this time!

I will say that the grilled cheese bite appetizer with a tomato soup sauce is delicious!! A must have if you come here."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Average Joe\" which is pretty much a cheeseburger with LTO.  It was the blandest hamburger I had ever had.  Didn't seem like the meat was seasoned at all!  I get the same thing at the diner down my street, for about a quarter of the cost, and it's better.  The bun was okay, toasted but still soft.  My husband got the \"Fire in the Hole\" and he loved it!  From the rest of the reviews, it seems to be a star on the menu.  Everything here is priced ala cart - so you have to order the burger ($8 - $12) and then sides like fries, fried pickles, etc are around $4.  They have some $10 specialty cocktails and alcoholic milkshakes, and what appeared to be a good beer selection.  We ordered a side of fries and it was enough for both of us to share.  They put Parmesan on them which was a different touch.  They taste like little garlic-bread sticks!  We also got a side of the truffle dipping cheese.  It really complemented the fries very well.  Atmosphere was relaxed on a Saturday afternoon.  There's mixed seating (hi-tops, tables, bar, and sofas/coffee tables) so something for everyone whether you're going to eat or just hang out.  Server was efficient, but I wouldn't call her friendly.  Indifferent, maybe?  Game was on and there are several TV's.  Volume can get loud.  Even though it is in East Liberty, parking was a cinch.  Use the garage across the street for free.  As we were leaving, they were setting up valet for the evening crowd.  All in all I'd say \"Eh\", but I would give it another try.  Maybe order something else next time, or spring for the Basil cocktail."}
{"text":"Burgers are fairly good, albiet considerably overpriced considering that it doesn't include any sides. If you want fries, you'll have to order those separately. Thankfully, the spiked milkshakes are delicious."}
{"text":"The fire in the hole burger is the best burguer I ever had in my life! And we also really like the Button buster. The shrooms was not great to me but it was a great burguer. The shakes are amazingly good and the fries with truffle cheese whiz are so good! But the best thing about brgr is that the meet temperature is always perfect! And for me that's the most important thing in a burguer place. The restaurant has since vibe and the staff is usually really friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Having missed my bus home and being thoroughly polar vortexed, I happened upon BRGR while wandering the streets of East Liberty trying to warm up. I was there during happy hour and though $2 off drafts and the $6 cocktails looked appealing, I decided to go the granny route and order a hot tea in a trendy burger joint. The tea selection was what you'd expect it to be a burger joint, but good nonetheless because it was piping hot. 

My server was prompt, professional, and friendly. She had only me and two other tables, so everything moved along smoothly. I ordered the mushroom and brie burger with a side of Cajun tots and crack dip. The burger was done perfectly medium but could of used a little more S&P. I only noticed the brie in about 1 or 2 bites because the burger was SLATHERED with the mustard aioli. A bit overpowering, to say the least, but nothing I would ever send back--after some scraping with the knife I was A-ok. 

The Cajun tots were solid, and I thoroughly enjoyed the house made ranch it came with. The big cup of crack dip was entirely forgettable. It tasted like an 4 day old chili and was a weird color of orange that I just couldn't get in to. Not worth the $1.50 for me, but I'm also not a huge chili fan so it may work for some others. Not enough crack in it for me to ever order it again, that's for sure.

Overall this place was decent. Not the best burger I've ever had but certainly not the worst. I'll be interested to go back and see what their cocktail menu is all about."}
{"text":"Yo! I got a burger and peanut butter milkshake here! How fuckin rad is that! Peanut butter milkshake son! Burger was rad too!"}
{"text":"Really good Kale salad, reasonably priced for portion received with goat cheese fritters are awesome."}
{"text":"Located in the South Hills at the Galleria where Dragonfire grill used to be. The decor is modern rustic looking. Very clean as you would hope for anywhere but especially at a new restaurant. 

This was my first time at a BRGR. I thought the menu was small compared to most restaurants in general but the focus is obviously the burger. After reviewing the few non burger choices, it became clear that a burger is what you are supposed to do. You can create your own by choosing toppings, bun, type of meat, etc. This could get pricey though because you pay for each item. I had the turkey burger (pictured) which was very good and I would happily have again. Their \"crack mac\" was tasty but underwhelming and not that special in my opinion. 

Burgers don't come with any sides, they are all al la carte but big enough to probably share between people. 

Bottom line, I thought it was good and would go back but I wasn't really blown away. I think you could get an equally satisfying burger somewhere else."}
{"text":"Tried the impossible burger for the first time, and it was amazing! It tasted exactly like meat. I subbed the impossible in the smokehouse bison and it was the best burger I've ever had, even when I ate meat!  Erin was wonderful and had such a cheery attitude. Will be my first stop next time I'm back in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Love it here! I'm a vegetarian but I'm not picky. If a new place opens up that is close to home, has good reviews and has at least one or two dishes I like - count me in! BRGR is usually always packed but we use the online app No Wait to secure a table well in advance. You can walk around the mall while you wait and that helps. The bar area is in one part of the restaurant and they also seem to put families with young kids on the opposite end of patrons without young children. As someone with a toddler, I appreciate that. 

I am not a fan of their falafel burger which is unfortunate because its the only veggie burger on the menu. It is dry, tasteless and I'll never order it again. I usually get the grilled cheese appetizer with a salad. My burger indulging friends do love the burgers though and the build your own options. 

Anyway, be ready for a long wait on the weekends but do try the milkshakes and beer sampler."}
{"text":"BRGR and I were on a long break, but when I needed to get my car's oil changed around the corner, husband and I decided to revisit BRGR. We split a couple of apps and a shake, and I was pleasantly surprised by both the food and the service. The grilled cheese bites were flavorful and not overly greasy, and it's hard to go wrong with the ingredients in the pork-n-tots. The only thing that disappointed was the \"crack\" dip--the description sounded like huacaina dip, which truly is crack, but we found ourselves dipping our remaining chips into the other dishes' respective sauces. Salty caramel milkshake gets two thumbs up, especially since I can't get my PB&J shake at Burgatory anymore...the world needs more not-overly-sweet milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after stopping at Top Gear Bicycle Shop.  We were sitting in our car in their parking lot and I was Yelping to find a restaurant nearby (yes, I do not know the neighborhood).  Well, I think 450 feet is close enuff to walk!  So, that we did to BRGR.  I noticed from the street that they have rooftop dining so that is what we opted for this warm October day.  They even had overhead heaters and curtains so that it was sufficiently warm enuff.

I ordered the steakhouse brgr for 13.00 which was, per their menu, \"8 oz handcrafted dry-aged prime beef, A1 aioli, arugula, onion straws, dry bleu cheese\".  I ordered it medium and it came out just the way I wanted.  I also ordered a side order of tater tots.  I must say their sides are portion sized for two so keep that in mind if you and your dining partner are ordering.

I didn't have room for a milkshake (next time).  

I enjoyed my burger and tots and the family-friendly atmosphere on the top deck.  It was fun people watching as we sat by the edge."}
{"text":"I frequent BRGR at least once or twice a month for lunch and/or dinner. While they do not posses the menu combinations you get at Burgatory, I feel you get a better burger and a far superior dining experience. The staff is friendly and helpful, and you have several levels to dine from open to the outside but covered seats on the first floor to the rooftop terrace. Seating is typically prompt as is the meal delivery. The shakes are great as well. Easily my 2nd favorite burger in town."}
{"text":"I was really, really disappointed.  Nothing about this experience, save the pretty patio and the ho-hum milkshake, was good.

I started off with the Salty caramel Bourbon milkshake.  It really got my hopes up that this would be a place to return to.  These positive feelings were soon crushed. The bourbon was prounounced and the ice cream was good.  It needed more vanillia bean flavor and more caramel.  I also did not like how thin it was, but I suppose that might have something to do with the extra liquid from the Bourbon.  I wish they served it in a more attractive glass with garnish, to really make me feel less of a jack ass for spending $8 on a shot and a half a milkshake.

I had the 'Kobe' burger.  It was ok.  It was not worth $13, considering it did not come with fries.  The patty was well formed and the burger did have good structural integrity.  I ordered it rare (if it's real American Wagyu it should be eaten as close to raw as possible) and it made me sad.  the meat was really unevenly cooked.  Parts of it were well done and others were more towards medium.  Unacceptable.  The toppings were nothing to write home about.
The boyfriend had the short rib burger.  It was even worse than mine.  The patty was poorly formed and started to fall apart as soon as he started to eat it.  He ordered it medium rare, but there was no pink to be found.   There was a quarter sized dollop of actual rib meat.  It was flavorful but it did not make up for how shitty the rest of it was.
We split an order of the chips and 'crack sauce'.  I'm not sure they make the ships in house, but if they do, they had been sitting way too long.  I suspect they are actually DRRTY brand chips that they have the gaul to pour in a bowl and serve me for $5.  The sauce was  a joke.  It's caned cheese sauce like you would get on nachos at a baseball game with some canned peppers thrown it.  It was offensive to my palate and my sensibilities.   

Severs/hosts in Pittsburgh must not smile.  It's been a running theme. I am baffled.  It's like they are actively trying to not be tipped.

I would not go back.  I wouldn't have minded the prices if the food had been even passable."}
{"text":"The best burger place like ever. Make sure to get the Double Yoi tipped with the mustard and BBQ sauce whichever you prefer and wash it down with a nice adult cookies and Creme or caramel salt Icecream shake."}
{"text":"My two boys took me to lunch today. (That's one of the upsides of having young adult children-they take you out AND pay!). This was our first time at this location. I liked the decor.  It was contemporary western. Cool walls that look like pallets lit from the inside paired with unique lighting. 
We started with an order of their chips and dip. They call their dip Crack so I had high expectations. Their chips are similar to kettle cooked chips and they have a dusting on them that I believe includes a BBQ flavor. The dip was disappointing. It was like they opened a can of chili and dumped it into little cups. I recommend you skip the chips and go straight for the fries!  They were hot, a little crispy and had a tiny smidge of herbs and cheese sprinkled on them. 
I ordered a made to order burger-Angus meat, white cheddar, bacon, and lettuce. The burgers come with a pickle on the side. I ordered the burger medium but it came out rare. I'm not a huge fan of rare but will eat it occasionally. The beef didn't have any flavor so even if I had sent it back to bee cooked a little more it wouldn't have changed the flavor. 
My oldest son made his own burger-angus beef, an egg, tomato, pepper jack cheese, and one or two other things. He ordered his burger medium and his too was rare. Please note that when I say Rare I mean the entire inside was pink. These burgers were only in the grill long enough to brown the outsides. 
My youngest son ordered a hot dog. At first I thought $6 for a plain hot dog was a bit high but when the hot dog came out it was huge. It was the size of four hot dogs put together. My son loved it. 
BRGR has a lot to choose from-burgers, hotdogs, salads and more. I think that a good burger can stand alone and can taste good without lots of toppings but that isn't the case here. So go wild with the choices of toppings because that is where your flavor will be coming from."}
{"text":"The way this place is set up is pretty cool it's very open it also seems like you are too close to the other customers though. My friend and I went here on a Sunday since another restaurant I wanted to go to was closed. I just ordered the potato salad and sweet potato fries. The potato salad was good I would order that again for sure. I would definitely go back here to try out the burgers."}
{"text":"This was a great tasting burger! I loved the atmosphere! I had gone there for lunch with friends and we had a great time. We sat on the deck on a very nice day! it was fantastic. The drinks where clever and the appetizers were impressive! I am looking forward to going back in the evening!"}
{"text":"Hey, 3 stars is A-OK. Sums up this BRGR. I am pretty sure my liking for this location is only out of necessity.  I am spoiled by my current area (and living next door to the original BRGR!), so when I trek back to my hometown area in the South Hills, I expect a few dozen incredible spots to grab food. No. That doesn't happen 'round these parts. I feel forced into appreciating this BRGR.

Between happy hour and the actual burgers, you're cruisin' just fine.  The drinks aren't incredible, but it's a restaurant in a mall. The happy hour specials are the best part of BRGR, so I can't pass up the six bucks on their signature cocktails.  Two poached pears later, I hit the appitizer happy hour specials with the fried zucchini and portobellos.  Zucchini wasn't bad. Really, I couldn't eat the mushrooms.  Mushy and bland, in conjunction with the tomato aioli (liquid smoke flavor tomatoes at best), I give up. I substituted with the orange sauce on the table for the zucchini.  The one that wasn't mustard.  I don't know, maybe chipotle mayo, thousand island? Good luck.

Same original menu that the other locations have seemed to stray from lately, which I really love.  Don't mess with a good thing.  That means the California Lovin' turkey burger is all mine.  In a world of those fearful of sprouts, it's a nice thing to see a big ol' heap of them stuck to the still-green avocado mush under the bun.  Speaking of bun, why can't I get something other than a huge traditional roll or lettuce?  The turkey burger is still incredible though.  The only draw back on this place is the service is a little rough--they typically seem understaffed or just not at that same level of service--and also the desserts aside from milkshakes. Yikes. By the time we hit the place, they maybe have one soggy, sad pudding and cookies jar of who knows what.  I love that they're get 'em while you can, made once a day kind of thing, but that usually means I can't get 'em.

Other than a few chains in the area, this is your lunch and/or happy hour option.  Luckily, it isn't a bad one. Just don't expect too much outside of those cocktails."}
{"text":"This is a nice spot a really nice decor. I like the fact they had a seating area away from the bar for those who are not interested in the noise that comes from the bar crowd. The burgers are top notch I order the belly buster and it was really good. Nice and juicy burger and the short ribs were cook perfectly. The Cajun tots were ok the seasoning could had been applied more evenly but they good none the less. I think this is worth the visit for sure."}
{"text":"Went for lunch; the hostess was all smiles and we were seated immediately.  Shared the BRGR burger and a Greek Salad.  The BRGR was dry aged beef with foie gras, greens, sauteed onions, aoli on brioche bun.  
Ordered the burger just Medium and it was cooked perfectly.  I loved the taste of the onion with the foie gras and crunchy greens.  It was delightful.
The Greek salad was you standard preparation; tasty, fresh and crispy.
I have to commend service here by saying; I mentioned that we were going to share everything and they brought our food to us in 1/2 portions so we did not have to cut and separate everything ourselves.  This extra step was a pleasant surprise and our server was helpful and friendly.  
I would totally come back here to try more off their menu.  Prices were affordable, service was very good and the food was delicious.  Oh and they have a full bar with drink specials."}
{"text":"I went in with a few people from work around noon. Service was prompt and the waitress was attentive. Unfortunately, the salmon burger I ordered was practically tasteless. Despite the \"salsa\" and aioli on it, all I could taste was bread and greens. For $10, I expect something tasty. The other four at my table had better experiences, but we all agreed that the food was oddly bland."}
{"text":"Went back for lunch; the parmesan fries were delicious, and though I loved the idea of my Big Fat Greek Burger, once again the burger execution left something to be desired. Between the condiments and the soft bun, my burger turned into a soggy mess very quickly, which was a disappointment. I love the service, and I still haven't had a spiked milkshake, but Winghart's serves my burger of choice in the 'Burgh."}
{"text":"I personally love Brgr!

The 'adult' shakes are always a good way to start or end a meal.

I have been there multiple times and have tried almost everything on the menu.  I do have a few favorites:

Gobble-Gobble burger; which is like eating thanksgiving in a burger.  The combination of the turkey burger, stuffing patty, pickled green beans and the cranberry sauce, make a perfect burger that doesn't leave you feeling to stuffed and is great cold!

Amore burger: is a beef and pork burger kinda like a meatball and topped with marinara sauce and two fried mozzarella sticks.  It sounds like a fatty burger but it fills the body with happiness.

I love their skinny fries which come in a basket big enough to share with at least 4 people.  

Their onion rings are perfect and taste great with their brgr sauce.

There is normally a wait on weekend nights but it is open from lunch to dinner so if you're in the mood for an early dinner I say GO For it!!

Great place with friendly staff.  I love this place, and I love it more since its walking distance to my house :)"}
{"text":"Their fries are a complete disappointment. They're soggy and flavorless and have the grossest texture. Their shakes are also quite flavorless. Overpriced, I regret all my orders from there."}
{"text":"This review is regarding my first experience ordering from BRGR through GrubHub and it was NOT good. My order was initial set to be delivered 45 minutes after ordering. After that 45 minutes passed and I noticed the delivery time had changed to another half hour later, I called Grubhub customer service. They said they would contact the driver, then said it would be another 10 minutes. Once again, the ETA had been changed. But it wasn't 10 minutes later, but another 20 minutes!!! And the driver didn't even get here within that time frame! It was at least another 30 minutes that I had to wait before my food FINALLY arrived!!! And the driver was rude and just handed the bag to us without any pleasantries, apologies or anything!! I'm so mad I tipped on my card prior to receiving my order. I want my TIP BACK!! And my money back!! Horrible service and the sandwich wasn't even good. I ordered the Cod Burger and there was Barely any fish on the sandwich. And of course by the time I got the food it was cold. So I had to warm it up in the oven, which meant more time that I had to wait before I could even eat it!!!! And all grubhub customer service wanted to do for my 'inconvenience' is offer me $10 off my next order.  How about refund me for this current terrible order because I surely don't want to use y'all again and won't be ordering from BRGR again. I'm not sure if the hold up was from the restaurant or the driver but either way it was terrible service."}
{"text":"Now that this location has been around a little long I have been back a few times and I'm surprised to say that BRGR is slowly becoming my favorite burger chain. They keep it simple and I like that."}
{"text":"My experience at BRGR started shaky but slowly improved. First, we were put on a half hour to forty-five minute wait for a party of two (note, they only accept walk-in reservations). The restaurant didn't seem to be at full capacity; however,  we ventured to the neighborhood in order to try this burger spot, so we didn't want to overhaul our plans. #endrant

Once we were seated, I ordered the BRGR fries and a alcoholic milkshake (the Cupajoe). The fries were thick cut and soft - not quite to my liking. They were also covered in shredded Parmesan cheese which didn't work for me. The shake was where the night started to improve. The alcohol the used was a bit poignant - not strong but overwhelming in taste. Otherwise, the shake was decent. I enjoyed the alcoholic shakes at Burgatory more.

The night hit it off for me when we switched from a high table to one of the cozy couch areas. These areas are meant for about five people and are great for talking with a group while chowing down and watching the game on a multitude of screens (inclduing a large projector screen).

The high point was the burger. I ordered the shrooms burger cooked at rare. The rare is more like medium rare at other places which was perfect for me. It was so juicy. It came with caramelized onions, mushrooms, and a drawing mustard aioli. It was so sweet and savory. Just a superb all-around burger. I would certainly return for it.

In terms of the overall experience, I prefer Burgatory to BRGR, but I wouldn't discount BRGR for a good burger especially when you're in the area."}
{"text":"Very chill atmosphere. The bar tenders let you be at the bar and didn't hound you to get a new beer. Beer selection was wide and had mainstays along with more niche brews. 

Burger was on point with a delicious bun and perfectly medium rare cooked burger. Major down fall was the burgers didn't come with fries which added another $4 to the meal. 

Price was about $3-$4 too expensive but if you're looking for a good burger, this is one to try."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of burgers not prepared by me, however BRGR has a pretty good aim on traditional and non traditional burgers. They have such a great variety of burgers that it makes your mouth water. During my first visit I didn't order food, only the spiked milkshake, and it was amazing, a little sweet for my liking, but nonetheless, great! During my second visit I had the Grilled Cheese bites, which were great, a perfect blend of crispy and butter bread with a tomato soup for dipping. I also had the Smokehouse Bison Burger, which was cooked perfectly to the temp i requested and had a spiciness that wasn't overbearing, but really tasty! Their sweet potato fries are really good as well, I like mine dipped in honey!"}
{"text":"This experience did not start off well. We checked the No Wait app and the Galleria location showed no wait, to come right in. Should have known when we walked up and saw tons of people that we weren't getting right in. 30 minute wait. Strike 1. We proceeded to have a seat, and while outside the restaurant we noticed 2 different groups of people waiting along with us. While waiting those parties had waitresses come up and get drink orders and then food orders for them. We kind of looked at each other thinking wth?? I guess they didn't notice us a mere 2 feet away, or maybe we didn't look hungry. Strike 2. We waited 45 minutes and finally got a table. Strike 3. After we were seated it took forever for a waitress to stop by, long enough we ordered everything at that time from drinking burgers to sides because I couldn't risk having to wait even more. Strike 4. It took over 20 minutes for the food to arrive, that is unacceptable to me. Especially when there were 2 tables seated after us that got their food before us. Strike 5. Food arrived, the burgers were actually cooked to medium (unlike most places even though they ask) And the onion ring and fry sides were both very large. If you were wondering about the fries in the menu the regular ones are frozen fries and the fresh cut fries have the skin on them and are actually fresh. Highly recommend those, fresh cut are always the best. Refills on the drinks was slow, super slow. Waitress was friendly. It by the time we saw her the entire evening had been ruined for me. They did give a 10% military discount. Wished a manager had made there way to our table (did see someone walking around to check on people). They would have gotten an earful from us. Highly doubt we will be back, sad because I really wanted to try their adult shakes!"}
{"text":"The one star is for the ambiance... My tuna burger was absolute mush and for $14 (w/no sides) I expected something cooked and seasoned to perfection. Also,  the crack dip on the menu just tasted like a cheesy chili sauce. 

As for the service our waiter looked like he'd much rather be somewhere else, like serving decent food, but he managed to be pleasant."}
{"text":"Alright, upon returning to BRGR after my not-so-good experience last year, I found myself hoping for a better time.  Well, I got my wish!  BRGR competes bigtime with the other burger joints in the area.

My burger, the Button Buster, was absolutely delicious.  It was cooked perfectly medium rare, just as I asked for.  You can tell that BRGR puts extra care in their meat.  One can taste the difference in the quality and preparation of the meat at first bite.

The toppings were great on my burger, and unlike last time, I did not feel jipped at all when it came to packedness factor (the amount of toppings they pack onto the burger).

Still, my one complaint is you have to pay extra for sides.  Just give me a side of chips, and charger me an extra buck.  I would rather have that then to pay a la carte for a side.  Also, gimme some more non-alcoholic milkshake options.  If they'd do this, they would easily be competing for the spot in my heart as the best burger in Pittsburgh.

All-in-all, it was a great meal.  I will definitely be coming back and bringing my family.  They deserve to have their minds updated and refreshed on what BRGR brings to the table."}
{"text":"I had the chicken wings for appetizer and the El Gaucho Verde burger with the impossible patty and added mushrooms and pico de Gallo. 

The wings came with a bunch of french fries, but they smothered the wings and fries in the hot sauce and ranch dressing. I don't like ranch on my wings and all of the hot sauce/ranch sauce made the french fries soggy instead of crispy and I wouldn't dip my fries in ranch let alone smother them in it. 

The burger came out and it was quite a mess. The patty was falling apart when lifting it up to take a bite. The burger had so much sauce from the tomato juices and the aoli that it was dripping with sauce. The sauce overpowered any other flavors and turned it into a mess that canceled out the flavors. The patty was thin, maybe a 1/4\" thick, so I was disappointed that it wasn't a bit heartier of a patty. 

I think BRGR has good potential as their burgers on the menu have interesting flavor combinations, but I was disappointed in this experience and much preferred Burgatory. I would want to try it again to see if I get a better burger next time"}
{"text":"I got the fire in the hole burger and it was delicious! I saw there were some complaints about the service, but our party of 10 had no issue. It may be due to the fact that we went around 9:30pm on a Tuesday. I wish you didn't just just get a burger without sides, it seems like that's the trend for burger places around here."}
{"text":"Nicely prepared tasty burgers!  The Tater Tots are to die for!  Great place to grab a drink and snack after work."}
{"text":"Big suburban burger restaurant and bar. But the food is surprisingly very good. Actually, the BURGERS are very good. I got the dry aged beef with white cheddar on brioche and was pretty happy. The fries were from a frozen bag is my guess. The salad was also probably from a bag, with some diced tomatoes and cuces on top and some dressing from the bottle. But the milkshakes... Those are the real deal. Fresh vanilla bean ice cream, caramel sauce, and sea salt on top. You can add booze too if you're feelin it."}
{"text":"A solid joint that nails the fundamental aspect of their business -- good beef. Their rooftop deck is also a huge plus. Bun, pickle, and toppings are so-so; if you're not quick, the bun disintegrates into a sloppy mess. Not that a burger place would be ideal for vegetarians, but the veggie burger is decent. It's best described as spicy falafel with some black beans sprinkled in. Overall, a pretty good experience.  Service and food prices were good. Beer prices were a little steep. Cleanliness was not an issue in our visit."}
{"text":"BRGR is always a good local go-to place for gourmet burgers. There isn't really anything on the menu that I would recommend over others. However, my one advice would be to make reservations on the NoWait app since everyone in PIttsburgh apparently likes to go to BRGR for dinner!"}
{"text":"Amazing spiked milkshakes... Burgers are unique and tasty. They do not come with sides, those have to be ordered separately. Although there are a variety of different burgers to choose from the menu is still somewhat limited.

They do not seat incomplete parties... which is always something that erks me."}
{"text":"I ate here recently and was very impressed.

Pros: Excellent, excellent burgers. Creative toppings, well-cooked meat, and great buns (often overlooked). Additionally, the burgers are inexpensive given the quality. The fries and particularly the Brgr Sauce are fantastic, as well. Finally, the alcoholic shakes are amazing.

Cons: Beer prices are high. I guess this is where they count on making their money. Also, service was slow when I went on a weeknight, so I imagine it's even worse on a weekend."}
{"text":"Since there are so few really good places to eat in the South Hills, we've really tried to like BRGR.  But, if you're a restaurant that specializes in burgers and you can't manage to cook them to order and get them to the diner hot, then why bother?  My burger has rarely come out the way I ordered it and the last couple times, the burger has been room temp.  Eww!  We were there this past Sunday night.  It was not crowded when we arrived but the patio filled up quickly.  There was only one server and he was definitely in the weeds.  In my opinion, it is his job to let his manager know this and it is her job to fix it.  My husband ordered a second beer which never arrived.  The manager reduced our bill, but that didn't make the meal any more enjoyable, just cheaper.  I think we've given BRGR plenty of opportunity to prove itself, so we'll just stick to Burgatory or Bubba's Gourmet Burghers in Bridgeville."}
{"text":"I loved this place. It was a week night, so it wasn't overly crowded.  Valet parking worked as expected.  The theme inside seemed slightly confused-- sort of a classier place but still with sports blaring on a million screens. Cozy though.

The lady I went with has nearly the total opposite diet I currently eat (vegetarian vs low-carb carnivore), and yet we were both able to easily find things we thoroughly enjoyed.  I ordered a fairly standard burger (sans bun) which came as a lettuce wrap.  I can't put my finger on what it was-- perhaps higher quality ingredients-- but I savored every bite.  Overall a great experience, and the first place in a long while that I'm actually excited about going back to soon."}
{"text":"Sorry, BRGR.  Your burgers just can't live up to the impossible standard that a certain other buger place in Pittsburgh has set.

I wanted to like this place, I really did.  It's close to my stomping ground, in my price range, and I love meat.  They had everything working in their favor, but unfortunately they fell flat!  BRGR doesn't have the selection of meats, rubs, toppings, or breads that the other place has.  People rave about their milkshakes, but the Partner In Cuisine and I agree that even though the milkshakes may be out of this world, for a place that is named \"BRGR,\" they should make more of an attempt at oh, I don't know...the burgers?"}
{"text":"I started my trip to BRGR with a boozy malt-tease milkshake and the beautiful, open bar.  It was massive and vodkay and delicious.

I'm not sure if i was just buzzed or what, but the double yoi burger was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.  I love that you can have your burger in a lettuce wrap, perfect for those of us who are gluten-free or just extremely full from aforementioned boozy milkshake.  They don't skimp on parmesan on the fries, either, and they are an herby explosion of deliciousness."}
{"text":"I had the seafood burger, it lacked seasoning, I was disappointed. The fries however were on point (hence the 3 stars)."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good things! 

I enjoyed my burger. I got \"the brgr\" (8 oz. handcrafted dry-aged prime beef, pickled red onions, arugula, creamy blue cheese, oven-roasted tomatoes), AND got to add a healthy piece of seared foie gras. (Aside: fois gras is not so easy to find in CA anymore...). Our little party also got both the herbed fries AND cajun tater tots. Both were delicious, and getting the truffled cheez whiz was a good idea. My alcoholic milkshake was also a win. 

So, after that, why only two stars? 

THE SERVICE WAS HORRENDOUS. 

It's like everyone who works here doesn't want to be there. They chat with themselves, they disappear for a while. If you're going to be in some sort of service position, you should look like you give a shit about the people you serve. Service was terribly spotty. The nicest, most polite person there was the busser - we asked him if he could send our server over (because we had basically been ignored for a while), and when I saw the exchange, it's like I could feel the eye-roll off his body language. And it still took a few moments longer than it should have to come over (of course, he had to finish that conversation with the other server). 

It's really unfortunate that, despite the good food, I'm really dissuaded from ever wanting to come back. The people that work here just suck that bad. Although, I would highly recommend that that busser go work somewhere that he'd get more in tips - I'm sure the lackluster service that the servers provide really affect his bottom line."}
{"text":"Warning: I've been here a lot, so this will be a long review.

I've always had a fairly pleasant experience when I have eaten here. The cocktails are excellent (whiskey shot with pickle back, basil gimlet, etc). The service is usually prompt and courteous. And the outdoor seating is nice.

Things I disliked:

-You are limited in the drinks you can order if you are sitting in the outside seating upstairs. Um, what? You mean the servers can't walk up and down the stairs to the main bar? I work at the three-story restaurant...we don't limit what you can order according to each floor.

-The baskets. I can't cut my burger in half very easily when it's in a basket. Additionally, the burgers are so greasy that by the end of the meal, the paper in the basket is falling apart, and it's disgusting.

-Not enough cheese whiz for the fries. It is the smallest cup ever given, and I'm not a cheese-eating monster.

-The tuna burger is gross. It is mashed up tuna pieces formed into a patty. Why can't they just have a tuna steak so I don't feel as if I will become ill by ordering the tuna rare, as I usually would with Ahi tuna? If it was a tuna steak, it would be an excellent sandwich.

-They don't take reservations...not even for large parties. So, on my roommate's birthday, we waited over an hour for a table even though we called ahead and they said they would save two tables for us. I understand a no-reservation policy, but for large parties, I think they could make an exception. It wasn't even a Friday or Saturday night.

-Pretty limited menu. And you can't modify anything. What if I like every single thing on a burger except the spicy cheese? Or I don't like onions? Come on. It's really not that hard.

-The crack dip is really not very good. It just tastes like cheese.

Things I like:

-The button buster. Oh my goodness, delicious. Especially with some of that stone-ground mustard. Nomz.

-The salmon burger. All those ingredients, arugula, the aioli, bacon...all go so perfectly together. It is an incredible burger. And the salmon is always cooked just perfectly so that it isn't dry.

-Service is always fast. I guess that's easy when your menu is basically all burgers.

-The truffle cheese dip. But, see above.

-The basil gimlet. That drink gets me messed up every time! In a good way, of course.

All in all, it's a great place to have a burger, but there are definitely some things that I'd like to see improved before I can give 4-5 stars. Will I be back? Absolutely. Is Burgatory better? Yes."}
{"text":"This is my second time here.  So I ordered a bacon cheeseburger at the bar.  I was served a cheeseburger with onions, tomato and cheese but no bacon.  I told them it was wrong and he said \"the kitchen is pretty busy so it didn't come out right.\" He brought me a plate of bacon.  Isn't it your job to make sure it's correct?  He seems to have no interest in his job or the people he is serving."}
{"text":"The excitement had been building all summer when it was announced that BRGR would finally open a franchise in Mount Lebanon's, stodgy, ho-hum Galleria mall, occupying a spot once held by the redundant teppenyaki showcase Dragonfire. Hype aside, I can soberly tell you that BRGR will Deliver The Goods should you choose to dine there...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soNcOfRvOtg

Ox horns bedeck the grey stone walls. The floors are wooden as are the dividing panels that make the open restaurant space seem as if it is a place unto itself. One can dine at the bar, at booths, tables, or around a couch near a faux fireplace. You'll forget that you're at a mall and fool yourself into thinking that a wealthy friend invited you over for a homemade lunch. The interior design is that ingenious. 

Even more ingenious is the menu. As a fan of Burgatory, I can say that BRGR has plunged its own flag into the hill, offering tricks and aces that the former didn't think of or keep up its sleeve. Having pecked that out, anyone who thinks that BRGR is swiping from Burgatory needs to stick with Five Guys. 

Yes, like Burgatory, BRGR allows patrons to customize their burgers by way of a checklist. But...does Burgatory offer sage stuffing, tomato-cucumber relish, 6 different kinds of aioli (!), braised short-ribs (!!), pastrami (!!!)? 

Does Burgatory leave squeeze bottles of complimentary, housemade condiments on each table? Go on. Dip your fries into that signature BRGR sauce (1,000 Island) you squirted a glob of onto your plate. It's free! 

How about potato salad? Ha! You thought only Tessaro's did that, eh? Our server, who happens to moonlight at nearby Red Robin, whispered that it is \"the best ever,\" and it is certainly a challenger, its ideally boiled spud cubes intermingling with a luxuriously tangy sour cream dill dressing garnished with fatty, briny bacon bits. 

And what of the intriguing appetizers? Ground Angus Eggrolls for the lady? How about Pot Roast Tater Tots for the kids? For us it was the Grilled Cheese Bites. Amusingly served with a dandy soup-like tomato fondue, this was childhood comfort food at its zenith. Toothpick-skewered buttery Texas Toast wedges bookended provolone, bacon, truffle aioli (Jesus!), tomatoes, and pickle chips. Each tempting tetrahedron glistened with ample layered flavors and textures while naked, but when coated with the zesty fondue became positively transcendent hors d'oeuvres.

Meanwhile, about that Angus bull in the room we're ignoring...

Like Burgatory, BRGR offers standard builds for the indecisive, but with all those fixin's, I had to set my imagination free. 

My meat of choice (there are 8 to pick from) was the Angus, mainly due to its engrossing chuck/ sirloin/ New York strip/rib eye blend, all of which introduced themselves to my palate without any of them overriding each other. Cooked perfectly to medium-rare, I uttered \"They nailed it\" as the savory juice dripped onto the plate and the pink interiors were exposed. Not wanting to overdo the accoutrements, I added the tomato-cucumber relish, the bearnaise aioli (gasp!), brie (oh yes, I went there!), short ribs, and guacamole. Constructed thoughtfully, the burger held together amazingly well. A Southwestern Eggs Benedict with steak and pot-au-feu on toasted Brioche, it was an opulent, handheld celebration of succulence, and I had it comin' to me. 

Desserts might be where Burgatory gains the upper hand. While my S'mores milkshake was very good with its mix of vanilla bean and dark chocolate ice cream, its miniature marshmallows came off as storebought (even if the ice cream itself is housemade), and its runny composition was a weak partner to Burgatory's thicker, far more decadent, more visually appealing milkshakes. Again, BRGR makes fine milkshakes, but I felt I could have had one of similar quality at any ice cream stand. Burgatory's milkshakes are on another plateau. 

Also indulged in was one of BRGR's cake cups. Reminiscent of a small parfait or a trifle, each dessert comes in its own chilled mason jar. Mine was of the Oreo variety and was crumbly, creamy, and adequately appetizing. 

BRGR's french fries stand a little taller than Burgatory's, however. BRGR's yellow, crispy, parmesan embellished shafts have a pristine nature to them, one that fits their extravagant surroundings. \"O\" fries these are not, as good as those are. Aristocratic is a word that floats to the surface. 

BRGR Vs. Burgatory ends in a draw, each eatery complimenting the other, neither failing in any capacity. Our metro area and the collective appetites of its inhabitants are big enough. There's plenty of room for both to battle for eternity. Angels Vs. Demons. 

P.S. Our wait during an early Sunday afternoon visit was less than 10 minutes. 

P.P.S. The service was superb. 

P.P.P.S. BRGR's cake cups come from an outside vendor called The Baked Pastry Company. 

P.P.P.P.S. BRGR's menus vary somewhat depending on location."}
{"text":"BEE-ARR-GEE-ARR has revolutionary gourmet burgers. 
About 20 beers on tap.
Cocktails.
Handmade shakes and more.
Ordered the Button Buster with braised beef short ribs, white cheddar, bearnaise ailol, onion rings.  Tasty and nice combo of flavors.  Had the BRGR fries tossed with parmesan + herbs.  Nice tasty and firm fries.  Tried some of the fries with the mayo based BRGR condiment, just like they do in many European countries and found that to be an interesting, too!

The manager was stopping at all the tables to check on how everything was.  

It's good to have BRGR in the area."}
{"text":"6PM Friday evening, we were probably close to being the last group seated without a wait.

The 5 starving souls in our group ordered:

2 Shrooms burgers; 2 thumbs up

1 Oy Vey (burger + pastrami + swiss + fried egg+ 1000 Island); ecstatic birthday girl

1 Custom mix of the Oy Vey & Button Buster. Basically Button Buster substituting pastrami for the Braised Short ribs (which I thought was nuts). Even though it is clearly stated on the menu--no substitutions--they were kind enough to accommodate an eyelash-batting 17 year old girl. Interestingly enough, most of this burger went home in a take out box. 

1 lamb burger (cooked medium--was my mistake. The burger was cold. I mean COLD) Loved the interesting curry and bits of feta, but was totally jealous of the steam coming off the others' burgers even on their last bites. I probably would not order this one again.

Also tried their fries with the truffle oiled cheeze whiz. Loved the fries, cheeze was ok. Also 2 orders of fried pickles. They are not spears or slices, but biggish whole pickles. Pickle-to-breading ratio a bit disappointing because they are whole, but nice crunch and flavors.

The girls (3) got shakes as dessert to go. I mooched a few slugs. WOW!"}
{"text":"February Burger of the Month Club! (Road edition)

Last meal from a great weekend included a trip to BRGR. One thing that I must say is that PIttsburgh has great bread. Sandwiches, buns, pastries...all have been fresh and tasted EXCELLENT. 

To drink..Spiked Milkshake. My choice? Salted Caramel! (Bourbon, caramel sauce, sea salt and vanilla bean ice cream) I was worried the bourbon may over power but when the tall steel cup came out with the large straw, I was thoroughly impressed. (Note, try spiked milkshakes more often.) It wasn't too thick to enjoy and surprisingly, I didn't feel like I was on a sugar rush afterwards. 

To eat....Cease and Desist burger (American cheese, carmelized onions, thousand island dressing) and for a shared side...Housemade chips and dip.  As I said earlier, bread in Pittsburgh has really impressed me. (random, I know.) But with the wheat bun on the Cease and Desist I was transported to burger heaven. The caramelized onions were a perfect shade of brown and the sauce and cheese did not overpower anything. BRGR cooks burgers to order and had great descriptions on the menu so you don't order incorrectly and my medium was definitely the perfect medium. The housemade chips and dip were tasty too. The dip is their own concoction that reminded me of nachos. Cheesy, a few black beans and some ground beef. I could've done without the meat in it because it was a giant clump, but I simply ate around it. 

The prices were closer to DC prices I pay back here at home but it was definitely a great lunch. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It was okay. We ended up here, instead of burgatory. Ordered fried pickles, expecting the smaller sliced pickles fried, like every other place in the world. Came out as fried pickle spears..., batter pieces fell off immediately after one bite and all that is left is a warm pickle. Bun on burger looks delicious, but wasn't. Kind of boring and so was the burger."}
{"text":"I love the food, but a word of caution if you sit on the rooftop - you will be ignored.  I sat up there twice and both times had to beg for water refills.  I definitely would have ordered more if the service was better, but it was easier to get the check and go elsewhere for better service."}
{"text":"I was not thrilled by the burger menu (limited) or taste of my burger. I did try a salmon burger from the person I was with, which was excellent, but would not usually be any beef-eater's meal of choice. The rooftop seating is always nice on a pleasant day."}
{"text":"Since i was child i've sworn off burgers, i had been forced to consume too many dry and bland ones, and i've been turned off by them until I came here to BRGR this past summer. The Kobe burger is amazing! I've been there twice and ordered the same thing, i just can't get enough of that tender meat.
    I always get it medium-rare (they provide a list of options with explanations on what your getting i.e. well done, rare) and it just MELTS in my mouth. The service is good and the location is up-beat without being too trendy. 
   My only problem is how expensive the drink menu is. The food is so well priced, its just sad to have to pay so much for drinks! My boyfriend and i went out on a date here and paid $30 for food and about $30 in drinks and we only ordered a total of three all together (two special drinks, one beer). Even the beer on draft is pricey. 

   Drinks aside, the food is amazing and all of their menu options are exciting and different."}
{"text":"5 stars for awesome burgers, great service and a great atmosphere!
This place is nice, in a good location, the girls and guys working are super friendly and bring the food out quickly.
I was starving when we arrived for a late lunch and their veggie burger really hit the spot!
I had the santa fe hippie 
grilled corn + black bean falafel burger,
guacamole, shredded lettuce, tomato,
pepperjack cheese, cilantro-lime creme fraiche
 which tasted like a huge crunchy falafel and the creme fraiche complemented this perfectly!
The man had the average joe since he wasn't that hungry and liked it as well.
Seriously one of the best meals I've had, very very good.
The place gets full but there is plenty of seating so it doesn't feel cramped, perfect for a casual date, get  together, wish we had one of these here!"}
{"text":"So incredibly boring and mediocre. When I compare BRGR to establishments such a Tipsy Cow, Burgatory, and Stack'd (as well as the manyeth American restaurants in Pittsburgh), the thought of this place does little to stimulate my excitement. The price point of these burgers ($12-14) begs the comparison. 

The service is very slow and they seem to not really understand the temperature at which to prepare a \"rare\" burger (see photo below). 

BRGR burgers are decent, but I wholeheartedly recommend paying other restaurants a visit when you've got a hankering for burgers."}
{"text":"Too expensive for the burger.  Rather eat at Red Robin. More for your money"}
{"text":"I absolutely love these burgers, but my new obsession are the Cajun tater tots. These tots are like crack, cause they keep me coming back. I am not a spicy person, but these are seasoned just right with the perfect amount of crunchiness. Service lacks at a table, but we have found the service to be better at the bar."}
{"text":"The service is good and they try to help with decisions regarding the menu. The issue is that the menu and the items contained in it are just not that good. Even my drinks from the bar were just OK... Not a bad place, just not that great either. Shakes are the highlight, but even those have gone south in quality and size.... Other options around town are much better."}
{"text":"Delicious sangria, great service, yummy food. Good place to meet friends or sit at the bar and read."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad, it really wasn't.

But I guess I just don't understand what the hype is all about.

One quick note:  There is no light on their sign, so if you go at night, it might be tough to spot.  This place is sandwiched right between Spoon and Goodwill. 

I went with a group of three and we had to wait a few minutes for our table, but were seated fairly promptly.  Our waitress was very patient as we tried to decide what we wanted, so the place gets at least 1 star just for her!

Drinks:
My friend wanted a Hurricane and either they DON'T have a truly FULL bar, or the bartender didn't know how to make it because they asked if there was something else she would like instead.  She ordered the Sangria instead and said it wasn't very good.  

I had the Salted Caramel Spiked Milkshake. YUM!  It was the best thing I ate all night.  The bourbon came through but not so much that it was not palatable, and the shake was just the right thickness.  I think it is the best thing I had all night.

Other than that, we all drank water.  I thought the spiked floats sounded very inventive, and if I go back I would probably try one.

Food:
We ordered the Homemade Chips with Crack dip and the Fried Pickles.  The Fried Pickles were tasty, if not a bit greasy for my tastes.  They are also fried in spears, not chips, just and FYI if you're thinking of trying them.  I don't really have a preference over how the pickles are cut, but some people are picky about that kind of thing.
The Homemade Chips were fresh and crisp.  The Crack did was pretty good, and we were impressed with the multiple layers of flavor, although we did note that it almost seemed like it was just melted cheese with chili mixed in.  Not sure I would call it Crack, but it was pretty good.

We all agreed the burgers were... MEH.... Not bad, not good, just a burger.

The meat tasted great and was well-cooked and I LOVE the fact that they source many of their ingredients locally, but the FLAVOR just wasn't there.  I had the Button Buster and it was like unflavored rib meat on unflavored burger meat with cheese.  The onion ring added some nice texture, but the flavor of that didn't jump out at me either.  It was just missing something... We decided, well, what do you cook ribs in?  Barbeque sauce.  So we asked for some, added it to my burger, and YUM!  So... tip: If you order the Button Buster, ask for a side of BBQ to go with it, sooooo much better.  

My friend had the Fire in the Hole and thought it was a solid burger, but wasn't blown away by it.  She also said she was still hungry after dinner, but it had been a long time since she ate, so take that for what it's worth.  

Our overall impression was this:

The menu seemed creative, but there was no mention of ordering a \"custom\" burger, so we didn't ask.  Alcoholic shakes = YUM.  

We wouldn't recommend this to someone who was asking for a phenomenal burger, we would send them to Tessaro's.  However if we had a group of friends going to BRGR and wanted us to join, we wouldn't say 'no.'"}
{"text":"The fries are fantastic, the shakes are awesome, but I'm not always a fan of the burgers. They're trying to do interesting things with ingredients, and they just miss the mark sometimes. The menu does change so sometimes they have some good options. Burgatory has better burgers and many more choices, which suit any appetite."}
{"text":"Just ridiculous & over rated. Mc Donald's fries & burgers were just ok. Server was just clueless & didn't even realize we did not have silverware.  Never again."}
{"text":"On our second visit, our food and experience was much better. 

We sat near the front in the armchair and couch section. The furniture is pretty worn but it's still comfortable and feels like home, although it's a little difficult eating over a coffee table. Service was a bit slow - and shouldn't have been - as there were not many people there for lunch. 

My friend and I had the California Lovin', which was the best turkey burger I've ever had - and among one of the best sandwiches in general. The flavor combo was fantastic. My husband had the Shroom and, by the looks of his glazed-over eyes after he finished, it was fantastic as well. I will say, however, that my friend's order was wrong - a lettuce wrap instead of a wheat bun and a mysterious order of bleu cheese that he didn't ask for. My burger was also on the wrong bun. My son's grilled cheese didn't look special but he certainly chowed it down. Our table shared an order of the regular parmesan fries, as well as the sweet potato fries - and both were fried to perfection. I love the selection of craft sodas; and, my husband, ever the hophead, loves that they have Ballast Point's Grapfruit Sculpin - albeit for $8/bottle!

I really hope that they: revamp some of the interior, improve service, and consider lowering their prices ($65 for three adults and a kid at lunch is sort of pricey).

Overall, I'm still a fan of BRGR and plan to visit again."}
{"text":"Not my day I guess.  Went to BRGR for a simple Caesar salad and Chili and a beer.  Of course they messed up everything but the beer.  I ordered chili with no sour cream... It came loaded with sour cream on top, I ordered salad very light on dressing....it came loaded with gobs of dressing.  The bartender showed me his ticket stating \"no sour cream and light dressing!\"  My issue is what if someone has a food allergy and the kitchen staff doesn't even look at what is requested.
If the kitchen won't look at customers needs and requests, I will not patronize this restaurant.  Someone is going to get very sick or die because this establishment refuses to look at customer needs.  Shame on you.  Naturally the manager offered me a refund which I refused.  What I really wanted...was what I wanted.  He totally missed the point.  Instead of offering me a refund he should have been in he kitchen coaching his staff and watching the orders coming in and going out.  Instead, he chose to sit customers and stay out front.  Too bad, the problems in the back"}
{"text":"Shakes=awesome. 
Burgers=over rated, but ok. (Shadyside Grill up the street has better burgers)
House chips=don't bother. 
Service= sucked. Slow service, bitchy server.

Next time I come to an overpriced/over rated burger joint like this one, I'll be sure to order my food without the extra side of pretentiousness. I guess I just don't understand the snobbiness that oozes out of this joint. The food definitely doesn't back it up..."}
{"text":"After moving back to da burgh after living in South Florida, where diners made THE best burgers in that end of the third-world-state, I was really disappointed in my options for getting a REAL burger.  At first, Tessaro's was the place I found that made the best, but on my second trip there with my best friend, the service was APPALLING, and enough so to never return, but that's for a review for Tessaro's.

Since the Tessaro's fiasco, the hunt has been on to find a good REAL burger.  The kind made with real meat, as opposed to the frozen hockey puck variety that most burgh joints pass off as a hamburger.  Well done, rare, or medium all end up looking grey and lifeless, and taste pretty much the same.

A variety of new burger joints all kind of popped up at the same time, so we started trying them one by one as transportation has allowed it. We rely on public transit, so thanks to PAT and the moron Steve Bland, our choices have become extremely limited.

Our first, and closest choice to try was BRGR.  

First, we checked them out on the web.  Ok, looks a little pretentious. But the food 'sounds' good.  At least on paper.  There was one little glaring item on the site though that made me a little wary.  It was the picture of the burger.  Now, the picture of the burger itself wasn't the issue, but more the warning-of-things-to-come visual of the pickle on TOP of the burger.  That looked like a gherkin to me.  And gherkins aren't known for being large.  But in the picture, the gherkin almost crossed the entire bun.

So we go to the restaurant, which is trying oh so hard to be all New York or LA chic, which in Pittsburgh just plays off as second rate pretentious.  This isn't kitsch or fun...it's just pretentious.

So we sit down with the menu, and the waitress comes over with her nose slightly tilted toward the air.  (the busboy was two hundred times friendlier)  I tried to probe and tongue in cheek inquire about that pickle.  I explained to the little girl about my misgivings on seeing a gherkin stretched out across the bun in the image.  Her response was to blurt out a condescending...'It's a CORNICHON!'

Well, whatever you want to call it sister, it's a TINY pickle, and it stretches almost the entire way across the bun.

We ordered a Jalapeno burger each, one 'basket' of fries with 'truffle oil cheez whiz', an order of fried pickles (there were THREE, and happily larger than the gherkin...errrr...sorry...CORNICHON), I had a Diet Coke, and we each had a spiked shake.  My friend ordered a Caesar salad to take home to her mom.

Indeed, the gherkin (whoops, I did it again...CORNICHON), was an omen of the size of the burger. These burgers (now I think I know why they leave out the vowels) were only slightly larger than White Castle sliders.  Tasty?  Yes.  But a meal? No.  Unless you're the bulimic type who throws up everything they eat.

The 'basket' of fries was barely enough for two, and the cheez whiz was ok, but not worth raving over.

The shakes were good, but again...it's a milkshake people, with a shot of booze.  

Three fried pickles.

And a waitress with her nose in the air.

The bill, for two slightly larger than slider burgers, two shakes, a basket of fries that wouldn't even qualify as a supersize size from McD's, three pickles (really one pickle cut in thirds) and a Diet Coke, plus a salad to go?  Almost $60.

Sorry kids...but this is definitely one of the 'FTLT' type of dining experiences.

FIRST TIME, LAST TIME.

When I go out, I'm looking for food...not toy food, and definitely no TUDE."}
{"text":"loved it. went on another lunch date with sheryl t. and got the mahi mahi burger and the black bean burger. both delicious. and filling. we also ordered chili cheese fries and could only even fit in about half. the prices were reasonable. perhaps a little much for a burger that doesn't come with fries but they're gourmet and pretty big! to drink, i had a \"sliberty shandy\" which was a yuengling/lemonade combo and was absolutely delicious. i'd go back any day."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with coworkers and it was just average. Our server waited until our meals were served to bring out the onslaught of appetizers which we had ordered which defeated them being appetizers. We split the check four ways and after two of us handed our server our credit cards he walked away. The other two persons had been ready to give him theirs as well and when we attempted to do so he snapped at our table and walked away regardless. Strange."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I came to dinner here one Friday evening. It was pretty busy when we arrived but we were given an estimated 20 minute wait time. Not bad! 

We got a high top table near the windows which was nice. The atmosphere was loud but not in a bad way... it almost made the place more appealing. She had been there before but I was dying to check it out after hearing every single one of my friends rave about it!

I ordered the Santa Fe Hippie ($10).... black bean and roasted corn falafel burger... OMG... did NOT disappoint. My girlfriend ordered the Shrooms Burger ($10).. the brie on it was amazing and for an extra charge she asked for arugula .... I was quite envious! 

Not sure if our waiter was really busy or just good at reading tables because he didn't come around that often.. but we liked that because we were catching up for the entire 2 hours we were there! 

Definitely a good time, I would go again and try a shake!"}
{"text":"We have been back to Brgr several times since my last review.  It was packed this past Wednesday evening. The food was excellent. Really good and served nice and hot.  I had the Oi Vey Burger which was fried egg, pastrami, cheese on the Burger. Wow.  The wait staff handle the huge rush of patrons really well. Our server was excellent despite the fact he had to big tables that all wanted separate checks (I hate that-embarrassing).  My only gripe this time is that the music was far too loud outside. We couldn't hear each other to have a conversation. The music was actually great, but too loud."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Brgr.  My husband ranks this burger joint in his top 5 list. Me- not so in love (at least with the burger).  

Pros: Cool atmosphere and vibe, generous portions (if that's a good thing- not sure), crispy fries and friendly staff.
Choose a more interesting burger- the braised rib burger, one with caramelized onions, and an interesting dressing or cheese makes for a yummy experience. (ie. what my husband orders)

Cons: If you like a juicy burger, you have to order the burger medium rare.  Medium doesn't have any pink color and all the juices are gone.  This has been tested a couple of times, so not just my bad luck.  
The basic cheeseburger is bland, especially if the burger is overcooked. 

I will try again, but my patience is wearing a little thin..."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed.  I sat at the bar without anyone greeting me for ~15 min.  I ordered a burger (although was surprised at the price since they're made w a blend including ground chuck?) to go.  Got home and literally had to throw it out.  Bland, way over done and dripping with grease (not the good kind as I previously mentioned the overdone-ness ).  I can confidently say I'll neither patronized the establishment nor recommend to anyone again due to poor service and overly priced low quality food."}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner on the rooftop outside. Our waiter recommended the pulled pork tater tot appetizer & it was a fantastic suggestion. I had The Brgr, it was pretty good. I did not enjoy the burger bun, however. It wasn't anything special and didn't add more flavor to the burger. It was a great experience but for my money I'd rather go to Burgatory"}
{"text":"Ok burgers (but please when I ask for medium can i not get a well done burger - everyone else had burgers so I didn't want to hold back everyone and order another one)

The shakes are ok, nothing too spectacular. I have only sat downstairs and not upstairs - so cannot say anything about the rooftop.

They used to have the greek burger on the menu which i liked but can't seem to find again.

Decent beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Cool place to get a burger!

Great place to go on a weekend/week night for the bar scene... And a burger wouldn't hurt either :-)

I've been here a few times before. The parmesan fries are tasty, and the burgers are good too! I've had the turkey burger (good), salmon burger (meh), and the regular beef burger (good). Love the ambiance of the place too!"}
{"text":"I come to BRGR a fair bit, as I live right around the corner. It's not the best burger in Pittsburgh, nor is it the cheapest, but it's still damn good.

My go-to burger here is the Button Buster cooked medium. Braised short ribs and a fried onion ring on a burger? Yes, please! I haven't tried many of their other beef burger options, besides the Shrooms burger (which is decent, but is no Button Buster).

For those not into beef, their pork, salmon, and turkey burger options are also excellent. The turkey burger, topped with their take on stuffing, cranberry sauce, and green beans, is literally Thanksgiving condensed into one delicious bite.

BRGR's sides are all excellent and the portions are definitely large enough to be shared; I've never been able to finish a basket of fries by myself. As good as their fries are though, my favorite side has to be the fried pickles. You get four large, golden-brown spears accompanied by their excellent housemade ranch dressing.

Finally, their beer and drink selection is excellent. I'm mostly a beer and cocktail person, so I can't comment on their popular spiked milkshakes. However, they always have a dozen or so beers on tap, with a cider thrown in there too usually. The taps rotate very frequently, which is nice. For those into whiskey and/or cider, one of my favorite drinks on the menu is one of their \"deconstructed cocktails,\" the Faded Pig. It's a shot of bacon-infused Jack Daniels, followed by a shot of balsamic onion brine, finished with a can of Jack's cider. It may sound a bit weird, but it's such a great flavor combination."}
{"text":"I rolled into town late in the evening, starving, and BRGR looked interesting. I arrived 30 mins before closing and was greeted warmly, without any of the usual \"have you seen what time it is?!\" attitude. I ordered a Woodford and ginger, and an Angus on brioche, with avocado and cole slaw to-go, topped with smoked cheddar and a taste of aioli; the avocado is a standard, gratis topping (HUGE bonus). One of the staff cheerfully brought my burger out, as he was leaving; again, with a warm disposition. What greeted my mouth when I got back to my room was nothing short of tongue heaven.

The burger was exactly as I ordered it, the ingredients were fresh and overall this was one of the best burgers I have ever had. Whatever they do with this cole slaw is both unique and amazing; it is a thick-cut, deep and complex topping -- not something most places even come close to.

Could my experience have been a fluke and some of these other less thrilling reviews here are true? I doubt it. What other restaurant in the world puts their best food and best foot forward at 10:30 at night, mere minutes before they close? To me, BRGR is a gem and I look forward to a repeat dinner tonight."}
{"text":"Went to Brgr Saturday night after discovering Wingheart's was not opened at the time. They surprisingly were not busy so we went up to the roof for seating. Service was fantastic. Immediately we were greeted and our waitress rocked. Didn't leave us hanging, checked in on us periodically and didn't dilly dally.

My boyfriend ordered the turkey burger and I ordered the fire in the hole burger along with a side of the parmesian fries. I ordered mine medium rare which looked more medium so there was enough juice. The peppers and the guacamole added nice flavor though the meat itself was bland so those fixings carried the burger. Nice buns! The fries were good though a little over done."}
{"text":"I have dined here several times, and while I can't say the burgers are consistently good each time, I have had more positive experiences than negative.

If I were to recommend ordering one burger in particular, I would suggest the 'smokehouse bison' burger (done mid-rare). It's incredibly juicy when cooked to this specification.

I also recommend trying (in addition to your burger) ordering the side of the seasonal cole slaw. It's very refreshing and makes an excellent side dish to your meal, but at $5, it's a tad pricey.

Overall, I'd say the atmosphere here is great - - awesome bar area, a beautiful outdoor patio for the spring/summer months, and great burgers."}
{"text":"One sip of the grown up root beer float told me it was fuh nasty! Not a hint of sweet anywhere. Just what tasted like mineral oil and vanilla ice cream.  Bleh!  But perhaps just a bad order for me.

Having already established myself as a true PITA by having to run to my car 10 seconds after being seated (and by run to I mean go move before the mean guy from the lot across the street where I - okay, illegally  - parked, got me towed.)

Then they replaced my root beer float with some kind of amazing 6,000 calorie chocolate drink which, of course, has lotsa alkeehol.

Then my burger came and I could hardly eat it because I was so maxed out on calories.  But it was all great.

Love the modern decor and the hippish crowd."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I say I'm getting a salad and I never do. The burgers are just too good to resist. My favorite is the King Salmon, which I've had with the lettuce wrap and on a  regular bun. The lettuce wrap option is a healthy alternative, but it's most definitely a knife and fork situation.  

I'm also a huge fan of their table-side sauces. With the tater tots, especially I like to experiment and  mix ketchup with the other types of sauce on offer for a variety of flavors. 

On of these days BRGR I'm going to get that Grilled Asparagus salad and show you!"}
{"text":"The waits are really long, the service can be spotty- however these guys make a good burger. Period."}
{"text":"Brian H. was the best waiter!! He was friendly and very knowledgeable. He took his time and explained the menu giving us great suggestions. Food was excellent. My husband and son had the bison and the burgers were juicy with just enough kick from the jalapeños. We will be back! Much better than Burgatory."}
{"text":"Best burger in Pittsburgh (yes that means better than over rated Tessaro's).  I had the Average Joe with cheddar and bacon, which was quite delightful.  To me, what makes the burger is the bun, great bun!  I also ordered some fry's to split with my wife, they were tasty as well.  Burger, fry's and a couple black and tans (not the Yuengling kind, but the real thing) how can you go wrong?  

The atmosphere is cool, we sat by the open garage door/windows so we could people watch and enjoy the nice weather.  

I think I will be returning soon and frequently."}
{"text":"I've been here several times since it opened years ago. I did the fried pickles, spiked milkshakes, and gourmet burgers, but mostly I come here for drinks anymore. It has an inviting ambiance and a nice big bar. The bartenders are pretty friendly and aren't too pretentious to chat with the customers! The cocktails are delicious, recently I had the gin basil gimlet. They also have gluten free beers, kudos! On the food: it's no Burgatory."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try something new for our weekly get together and we settled here. We were amazed to see that the menu resembled Burgatory which allows you to \"craft your own burgers\" in a similar fashion.

We had table seating in a wooden western style room. The waitress reviewed menu options with us so the two of us decided to try the BRGR signature burger. We were stunned that this burger comes with foie gras (a $12.00 upcharge if you opt for it). Haven't seen foie gras in any casual family dining in my life! The two of us also decided that since the burgers were 8 oz we would split an order of cole slaw which came with gold raisins and carrots.

While we were waiting for the entree the manager came and explained to us that this is the 4th restaurant in the city and when the weather improves they plan to expand and put on an outdoor deck for outdoor dining.

We had our meals served fairly rapidly. The BRGR is dry aged prime beef alone with pickled red onions, arugula, creamy blue cheese, and oven roasted tomatoes. Laying on top of the burger was a long piece of the foie gras. Since we both ordered the same thing we found the burger enjoyable but nothing to give a hoot about. We had ordered it well done and it came that way.

On the other hand we were definitely impressed with the cole slaw. The addition of the gold raisins made it so good!!!

I found that this place has complimentary Wi-Fi. They also specialize in milk shakes and floats where you can choose to have them \"spiked\". They have a wine and alcohol list as well since they have a bar there but we were too full from our meal to try any of these.

The place wasn't overly crowded since we came mid afternoon and we were each given paper copies of the menu to take home. I guess they must have take out but I really don't know for sure.

As far as the foie gras goes, it is overpriced and I feel it is a delicacy you would better enjoy in a finer restaurant.

Other selections include various appetizers, hot dogs, and salads. The Galleria where it is located has a multiplex theater inside of it and this place would be a great place to go before or after a movie.

We will give it another try sometime in the future."}
{"text":"So, 5 years ago you couldn't find an unfast food burger joint in the Burgh. Now, you can't swing a cat by the tail without hitting one. 

Not that I don't mind a good burger joint, being a vegan, I find it to be like a treasure hunt. Please my taste buds without animal flesh and you'll have a customer for the life of your eatery. 

BRGR's vegan offering is falafel-\"esque\"in taste and texture. Heavy on the belly after eating. This burger, with its Greek/Lebanese spice & herb influence went well with the Flower Power IPA. I paired this \"burger\" with a tasty slaw done without mayo, opting for a healthier vinegary dressing with apples and golden raisins. Excellent foil for the falafel burger. The slaw's sweetness paired well with the heavily spiced chick pea burger. I've had this offering at the original BRGR, and still the best IMO) I was hoping for something new for the meatless crowd.

I hope this sudden \"need\" for there to be a gourmet burger joint on every block of the city does come to an end soon. But at least it's not another Applebee's, Chilie's or TGIFriday."}
{"text":"Burgers are pretty good, and alcoholic shakes are always tasty. But honestly, you can't screw those up easily. I love the atmosphere and the upstairs. Twenty-somethings in the eve, families earlier in the day. My only gripe is that host. Honestly, I can't even remember ever making an opinion on a host but that guy is really an ass. Overall, rec'd if you're in the area but if you live north- Burgatory."}
{"text":"Delicious veggie burger, nice atmosphere, and some of the best french fries I've ever had. Oh, the staff has been amazingly friendly every time I've been here, too. Friendly, cheerful, and joking. Be sure to grab a draft beer, as well. I could do without the TV's, but that's just me."}
{"text":"We went over after movie. No wait to be seated. Food came pretty quick. Burger itself was ok but bun was very dry and flaky. Fries were ok. For the prices they charge food quality and flavor wasn't where it should be. Had burgers at Hard Rock Cafe on vacation that around same price and twenty times better. Either improve on food taste and quality or drop prices. 
Restaurant was clean, waitress attentive. Manager didn't come to table but did take some $$ off bill."}
{"text":"BRGR is a convenient spot to grab a burger (...as the name suggests) on the Shadyside/East Liberty border, especially when the weather is nice enough for the upstairs deck to be open. There is plenty of seating between both spaces, and I don't remember having much of a wait during the handful of times I have eaten there over the past few years.

The menu is fairly simple and straightforward. There are a number of meat (as well as non-meat) options and flavor combinations, as well as sides and shakes. I had the Fire in the Hole burger on my last visit. I'm a fan of all things spicy, so this seemed like the obvious choice. The burger comes with pepper jack, chipotle mayo, sriracha, and a layer of jalapenos under the burger. It's all cooled down by the addition of guac. There was a ton of flavor between all of the sauces and toppings, and the heat was present but not overpowering.

My friend and I split an order of fries with the \"truffle cheese whiz.\" The fries were tasty in the cheesy, truffle-y (is that a word?) dipping sauce. The sides are pretty big and meant to share... we had more than enough food with a burger each and the fries to split.

I think it would be nice to see some fresh menu options; I don't go here too often, but it seems like the burger options have remained largely unchanged since the location opened. It seems like there is always a new burger place opening in Pittsburgh, but this is a reliable option in a good location."}
{"text":"Consistently great burgers and creative sides/shakes. 

Parking is tough to find,  so plan to walk, valet,  or get creative with parking. 

But when in Rome definitely try one of the burgers,  they're a must."}
{"text":"Good burger place with an okay menu. I would prefer they add some items other than just burgers and salads. The salad I ordered was drenched in dressing; good but wish I had asked for it on the side. My mistake. The music on a Sunday afternoon was also super loud and you couldn't really hold a conversation with people. Standard burger joint with good food. I prefer Hopdoddy in Austin or Shake Shack, but I guess this will do!"}
{"text":"Food was really good hope they survive here had awesome service. My new thing is going with whatever is on it. waiter was informative and had good suggestions. Been told to try it out by a friend lets just say I will be back"}
{"text":"I went to Brgr last night with some friends. Before heading out I checked the reviews here. Some good, some bad, but working in the industry you're going to run into that no matter where you go. Here's my take: I got there first and told the host a table for 3 with the possibility of 4. After I was sat I got notice that it was going to be 6. One of the reviews talked about having a hard time getting a table for 7 because they wouldn't move the tables. Well, when I said that I was sorry but the number was now six, the host told me no problem and slid a table over to accommodate me. It all depends on when you go and honestly who you get. I went on a slow Monday. 

My server came over and started a nice conversation with me while I was waiting. I wanted to start off with a beer and then get into a spiked float and a spiked milkshake later on. She was able to give me her recommendations on her favorites and when I told her what I liked and didn't like she helped me narrow it down. I ordered some appetizers for when my friends did get there...homemade chips with their \"crack\" sauce and fried pickles. I ordered two of each and it was plenty for all of us at what I thought was a good price. Once my friends got there we ordered more drinks, I got the spiked cherry float, I like Maker's Mark so this was a good choice for me. It was a little strong but after a few sips I put more cherry soda in it and was able to dilute it enough. Right after that I asked for \"The King\" milkshake, I imagine named after Elvis' love for peanut butter banana sandwiches. This drink was so good I had to share it with my friends...after all was said and done I only got half of it. But I convinced one friend to get one too so I could have some of hers. I want another one right now. 

As for a burger, I had the Bison Wing, bison meat and chicken skin covered in buffalo sauce and bleu cheese and a carrot-cole slaw. I could have done without the slaw, but that's just me. I still ate every bite. The meat was cooked exactly the way I asked for it and looking around, I saw that everyone else was enjoying their meal as well. 

As soon as I got to work this morning, I told a couple guys that they had to bring their wives here and I am sure that I will be returning. So what I will tell you is that you should go. You're reading some reviews so you'll know what to expect and you can make your own opinion about the place. I, for one, like it."}
{"text":"Interesting menu but always disappointing. Overpriced for the quality of ingredients and portions. Each time I've eaten here, I wish I had just gone to Five Guys and saved a few bucks for a better product."}
{"text":"The food there has no flavor, service was terrible I have never giving anything 1 star before but this place deserve it"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed and I mean obsessed with the deep fried pickles and fries. Of course I've had the burgers which are also good. But, I find myself ordering these two sides on every visit."}
{"text":"Why does this keep happening to me?? I know for a fact that I've checked in and reviewed this new location and added pics! In fact I think I was the first to do so. What's going on Yelp?
Anyway, I like this new location. Much like the original spot in East Liberty it lives up to its reputation with outstanding food and service. The fried pickles are by far the best I've ever had. Parmesan truffle fries are amazing! And the burgers are always cooked properly, seasoned to perfection and juicy.
I'm so lucky to have the East Lib location close to home and this one close to the office. 
Keep up the yum!!"}
{"text":"It's our favorite of the \"burger\" joints in the Burgh. The cease and desist burger is what I almost always get and she always gets the tuna burger. The cease and desist burger was initially called the Double-Double after the famous In-N-Out burger but they got a letter from their lawyers asking them to cease and desist. Viola. They are usually spot on with burger temps and even if they go over the burger is still juicy and enjoyable. The Mrs. always gets the salted caramel spiked shake(Jim Beam) and it is delicious. I love that they have Coke products because frankly Pepsi sucks. Nice comfy atmosphere and the service is good as well. French fries are the thin kid which I like and the fried pickles and Cajun tater tots are snacky sides to get. It's reasonably priced and there are lots of tv's if there is a game on you want to watch.

8.5 of 10 stars"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch before heading back to New York and it was a bit disappointing. 

Parking was easy on Presidents Day, but I don't know what it would be like on a normal day. 

What we sampled: 

Button Buster Burger 
           Overall it was cooked alright, but a bit overcooked when compared to the amazing job done on the burger from The Porch.  The toppings were delicious, but I was looking for something light to break through all of the heavy flavors, and it could definitely have used a bit more cheese which was almost nonexistent. 

Fries with truffle cheese wiz on the side
            O.M.G. truffle cheese wiz!! The fries were cooked well and were delicious, but the cheese wiz was amazing. 

Fried Pickles 
           According to my other half Rotem these were the best fried pickles he has had outside of Mississippi, and I have to agree.  I never really understood his obsession with fried pickles until I at the ones from here! 

Overall the food was just ok, but I could not stand how I could feel the vibration each time someone passed behind our table, and the service was just bizarre.  Our waiter was efficient getting our drinks and food, but then things got weird.  He collected our stuff after we were finished and then we waited....and waited....and waited....a good ten or fifteen minutes without any food or anything in front and no offer of dessert or anything before we finally had to ask for our check.  Rotem wanted to just wait and see how long it was going to take for them to bring over the check on their own, but I had to make it to the airport!"}
{"text":"Poor Brgr! I went here about a week after I went to the new Wingharts burger joint down in Market Square. I think Brgr would have held up in the bigger better burger contest if I had tried this burger first. Since it was after Wingharts KILLER char-grilled burger deliciousness, it's sadly going to get a much lower rating. 

Don't get me wrong, the shroomz burger at brgr (I had to...) was tasty, but it just doesn't hold a pickle to this other burger. And by pickle, I mean the tiny little gherkin they perch on the top of Brgr's burgers. 

The thing I will rave about was the boozy milkshakes. I wish it was humanly possible to slurp down 5 of these like you can any other delicious cocktail, but really, that's not humanly possible without feeling like you're going to die. I got the boozy Almond milkshake, which had Ameretto and Kahlua mixed in with ice cream. To top that off, there was sugary almond treats at the bottom. My heaven would include these milkshakes being served at the pearly gates entrance! 

The service initially was so so. I had called earlier in the day to try and reserve a table for our party of 15. The person on the phone was a little pissy and told me they don't take reservations. I said, well I just want to let you know then that we have this large party coming in. He said, and I quote, that they only had 70 seats, with some being couches and two tops. Those 15 seats would take up most of their seating. I'm no mathematician, but really dude?! Do they not understand that we'll be spending a lot of money, especially with the part of the crew that likes to overindulge on the booze. 

So we get there and the hostess, and what I assume are the manager, are just walking back and forth around an L shaped area of seats and a longer set of seats. I went up to them and was like....we'll squish, just put that long set of tables together. I worked at a restaurant for 5 years, I picked a thing or two up I suppose. After that, service was just fine! 

I would totally go to Brgr again and space out my boozy milkshake intake after a meal, but I'm not sure I would come back JUST for a Burger. So for Brgr I say no burger but a round of boozy milkshakes for ALL!!"}
{"text":"Great burguers and milkshakes. Long lines, but I guess that's a good thing, right? Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Completely empty restaurant and they sat us right next to the door when it's freezing outside. Made for an awful and uncomfortable experience from the start. I ordered a milkshake because it was supposed to be what they're good at, but it looked and tasted just like a tall glass of milk with one ice cream scoop plopped inside. The waiter never came back to ask how it was either. It was not made well at all. The wait staff was awkward. For how slow the restaurant was, there was no excuse for our food to take as long as it did or for the service to be so bad. Also there was no soap in the bathroom. Will not be back or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I have been to the BRGR location in Shadyside several times since it first opened and while it isn't a fine dining restaurant, I have always enjoyed both the food and the service. It is a good neighborhood spot for a decent burger. Or it used to be. I was extremely disappointed when I went there last week (Saturday) for several reasons: 1) The Service or lack thereof - we were promptly seated when we arrived which was surprising for a Saturday evening. The restaurant was not as crowded as I have seen it in the past. Perhaps our experience that day is an indicator of why it was so quiet. The hostess was pleasant and very friendly. We remained seated for a good 20 plus minutes and not a person showed up with water, silverware or to take out order. I had to finally get up and go to the hostess and ask her if she could send someone to take our order. Again, she was extremely nice and apologetic and immediately sent someone over. She even compensated for the wait by not charging us for our shakes. She was the only good thing about that evening. The server assigned to our table was terrible! She was indifferent, seemed to be in a huge rush (no idea why given how empty the restaurant was) and just didn't care. She got our orders and went off. During our entire meal she came once to ask us how our meal was but never bothered to follow-up about our beverages or water refills. She did however come to our table several times to ask if she could clear our plates even when there was food on it. We had to tell her again and again that we were still working on our meal. I am not sure if her shift was coming to an end or she just didn't want us sitting there! It left a terrible taste in my mouth and I felt rushed and uncomfortable. Which leads me to 2) The Food - in a few words - terrible, under cooked and tasteless. Like I mentioned, I have been to the location several times so this was a first. The food came quickly and on eating it we realized why! Our burgers were under cooked (at least two people in our party including me got sick) and the buns were stone cold....right out of the refrigerator cold. Two of us ordered the spiked salted caramel shake, something I have had many times and enjoyed. This time, we were served a vanilla shake where the ice cream was not even blended thoroughly, barely a drizzle or taste of caramel and a shot of bourbon. That is not what i remember having the dozen other times I have been there. And most certainly overpriced for what we received. It was a good thing that the hostess had been gracious enough to not charge us for the shakes to compensate for the long wait. But it definitely ruined our meal. 

The shadyside BRGR is in a prime location with a very discerning demographic and plenty of dinner options available. If I were them, I would not get complacent and make sure that both the service and the food quality is fixed. I am not sure if I am going back. Burgatory seems to be a better option if you are looking for a \"gourmet burger\" or even McDonald's for a decent meal!"}
{"text":"Since I have been here twice now; once during a busy Friday night and once during a regular weekday dinner, I feel I can more accurately review this place.  (And since having a burger at Burgatory - I had to come back and take away another star)
Yes, SOME burgers are as amazing as everyone is claiming; however, it's other areas that only make me give it 2 stars.
The service is hit or miss.  Busy Friday night, don't expect to see your server all that much because they get busy.  Plus, the first time we were there, we were directed to go upstairs by the hostess because our \"table was ready\". When we got upstairs, all 3 servers acted as if we were the next inconvenience and there wasn't a \"table ready\".
Also, if you are sitting upstairs, you can't start off with an appetizer because the food runner only makes one trip per table, and everything will come out at once.
Sitting downstairs, you can enjoy a Pre-meal app.
The menu changes.  I am all for change, but you definitely can't go back for a \"favorite\" if a particular burger really won you over.  We went back for \"The Devonshire\" to only see it's absence from the menu.
Also, if you're famished, like can EAT A BURGER famished, sadly, this isn't your place.  The pricey burgers don't come with sides and are presented in a basket with paper.  A side of chips or fries to add to your burger are $4+; so you may be more likely to share if you're on a budget.  Both times, I have left still hungry because there is A LOT of bun on those burgers, and sharing a side of (cold) \"homemade chips\" doesn't cut it.  Plus, for what we pay, I at least expect a bit more creativity in the presentation besides a burger basket.
And I won't lie - I think the TVs downstairs are really tacky and totally take away from the ambiance.  They have this sleek and modern interior that totally gets lost with everyone's necks craning upwards to watch TV.  Is it a sports bar or a restaurant?  I'm confused...
This is a great place to get a \"bite\" to eat, especially if you're craving a quality, yet very creative burger - this can be your place.  However, if you still want a good burger, but a MEAL that will leave you bursting your buttons, go to Buffalo Blues, Tessaro's or Burgatory."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here, for the first time, with my family for my birthday this evening. I have to say the place is a little smaller than I anticipated. I was sitting right next to a pillar and could only move my right arm a few inches when eating my sandwich.  

My burger was cooked just the way I like it and was very tasty, although the bun was rather generic and a little mushy.  They have a nice selection of craft beers, and I was able to find one that I had never tried before and it was delicious!

The only disappointing part of the evening was our server. She was not friendly at all and did not smile once through the entire meal, and did not even ask us how our meal was.

I would probably head back to Burgatory before I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Stopped by here last week for a date and this place gets 5/5 simply because the date went super well (haha just kidding - kinda).

The restaurant was pretty empty so it was nice and the environment was really welcoming. The staff were all really friendly and really nice. The food came out fast and it was delicious! We both ordered the BRGR and had no complaints. It was the perfect serving size and we got a basket of fries to share.

My date actually broke his water glass (HAHA) but the the staff hurriedly came out and cleaned it up and were very nice about it. We both appreciated that a lot. Look forward to coming here again!"}
{"text":"I come here quite often and have always had great experiences. Service is good, the food is good, and the shakes are AMAZING (my favorite is The Dude which is not on the menu). I always fall into a severe food coma immediately following the meal, and need a good nap if I plan to do anything remotely productive at any point during the rest of the day. Despite that, I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Walked into BRGR early Saturday afternoon, and they had about 15 patrons seated and situated. Once we were seated, without waters, drink orders, etc., we sat idle for about 25 minutes (while staff walked past us 6 times). We then decided that this was completely unreasonable (seeing that several staff members were standing around) and decided to leave and walk to Urban Tap right up the street, where we were taken care of in less than 5 minutes. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Brgr has imaginative tasty burgers.  BUT, for a $13 burger I expect more.  The portions are small.  The food is greasy.  The prices create an expectation of a higher end experience.  The food is tasty, but they really need to take the atmosphere and dishes to a higher level to justify their prices.  If I want a gourmet burger, I'd choose Burgatory at the waterworks instead."}
{"text":"Very slow service.  Messed up our orders.  The appetizer came out wrong (fires instead of homemade chips and my burger wasn't supposed to have cheese on it.  Probably a good mistake as the chips were pretty bad.   Not my favorite burger joint.  I would much rather hit Ray's Hellburger in DC for a good burger!  The Green Man shake was the best part of the meal!"}
{"text":"We decided to give BRGR another shot, add I had only been there right after they opened and was underwhelmed. 
Today, around 130 on a Saturday, it was surprisingly not very busy. We were seated right away at the table of our choosing. Waitress came up to us very quickly, and was smiling and sincere. We ordered drinks and fries to start, and they came very quickly. The fries! So fresh, with a perfect amount of parm and herbs. I got a sly fox pils, it was very refreshing.
My mahi mahi (Maui wowie on menu) burger was obviously freshly made, not a frozen pattie. I had it on the lettuce wrap, which actually worked well! My friend had the shroom burger, and she said it was great... It must have been because she never finishes anything and there was only a bit left! 
All in all, extremely pleased with the great lunch, atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"We have always wanted to try this place , so today while at the Galleria we decided to have lunch , sad to say we still have not sampled their food , we were seated promptly- but sit there for 15 minutes waiting as waitress after waitress passed us by , we ask the hostess and said yes give us a minute another 5 and we left would be different if they were busy but in this case not."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!! Service was awful and the manger was even worse. I would never go back here. We ordered an appetizer when we ordered our drinks. After we ordered our food our waitress never came back. We had to call her over to our table multiple times. She never refreshed our drinks. After 25 minutes of waiting for our app, we had to reminder her that we wanted our appetizer before our meal. She stated \"ohhhh yeah I forgot\". She brought the app out and 2 minutes later brought out our burgers. We order 1 medium burger and 2 medium well. The two that order medium well were still dripping blood! The medium was the most cooked burger. When we called our waitress over to ask to have new burger (yes -- she never return to check on us after delivering our food-- we had to wait another 15 minutes) she gave us an education on how that is how BRGR does their burgers. She said that their cooks are the worst ever. After taking our plates back to the kitchen she returned to tell us that they were \"heating them up on the microwave\". SERIOUSLY???????!!!!!! 

When we asked to talk to the manager she came over and asked what we wanted her to do about it. We said we wanted new burgers and she said she would see what she could do. When she returned we told her that we didn't want the food anymore and we were leaving. She told us that we would have to pay for the check! When we questioned it she said \"well you have to pay for the beers\". I was fine with paying for the two beers we got. When she brought over the check it was $40. When we questioned it, she insisted we pay and ran back into the kitchen. We went up to the hostess booth and asked to speak to the manager again. She came out and threaten to call the police if we didn't pay. FOR FOOD WE DIDNT EAT!!!

We live 5 minutes from the Galleria and we will never be returning. Especially since their own staff says their cooks are the worst! No thank you! Beware and save your money! Wish you could give a zero star on yelp!"}
