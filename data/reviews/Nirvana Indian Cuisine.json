{"text":"Possibly the best Indian in the Valley and definitely the best tandoori chicken I've ever had. We had the aloo gobi, tandoori chicken, chicken curry and garlic naan. Everything was ordered spicy and they definitely delivered. Excellent service and portion size and they have a full bar, you can't go wrong. I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Buffet is very very bland, below average and limited. Nothing tasted fresh. Only available Veg biryani is dried out. Naan is bad. I had better experience in the past. I usually don't write 2 star review but sorry Nirvana, I will have to think twice to go here again.

Egg Bhurji in buffet?"}
{"text":"This place hit the spot today.  The owners recently moved over from a couple of blocks away.  This location is much nicer and way more convenient.  They were only closed for a couple of weeks but it seemed like an eternity.  I'm told the buffet is coming very soon.  Sounds like the grand opening is next week and for now they are open for take out and dine in.  As usual, the food was delicious (chicken tikka masala) and the service was excellent.  So happy to have them back."}
{"text":"Glad this place reopened in a newer area. They always have the best customer service. The staff us so friendly and attentive. The lunch buffet is awesome and tastes delicious. The tandoori chicken is yummy and they always bring a fresh basket of naan with your meal. Also the free mango laasi is always refreshing! Great place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in AZ! The food is amazing. I get the chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan at every Indian restaurant I go to... I have to say that Nirvana tops all of them. Not only is the food delicious, but the staff is amazing and quick. That's a big deal for me when I go to restaurant... the customer service has to be exceptional and Nirvana definitely accomplishes this! :)"}
{"text":"This is probably the best vegetarian Indian food I have had in a long time. 
They have really great ambience and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great customer service and the food is delicious! Great variety to choose from. I'll definitely be coming on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I dont usually write reviews but this restaurant is my favorite place to get goat curry. My husband and I went to their previous restaurant and are regular customers. The staff is friendly and the service is top notch. The food is also served promptly and hot which is a thing I very rarely get in other restaurants.  Bottom line is that their food is delicious."}
{"text":"Did a yelp search for Indian Food and Nirvana came up with the option for take out. Put in an order (easy) for Chicken Tikki Masala and Lamb Vindaloo. The hostess was very nice and the food was excellent. The medium had a heat factor that kept building and was chugging water by the end of the meal!"}
{"text":"After having (perhaps inexhaustively) sampled Indian Buffets in Boston and San Fran, I think this is the best one we've had. Delectable mixture of spices and dishes. My only minor gripe (and truly very minor) is that their buffet is a little spicier than at other places. I love it. But our 4 year old daughter needs to eat at home ahead of time since it's too much for her.

Now back to working on Indian Buffet Processes..."}
{"text":"I ordered two main course from here as a take away for the first time yesterday which was served with white rice.No doubt both the main course item tasted extremely good and the quantity of the white rice was so huge that it was overflowing from the box as soon as we opened it.But also it clearly smelled(and tasted) stale which made us think that if that was the reason for such a huge quantity of rice that they were just trying to do away with their old lot.i ended up tossing the rice in trash and made my own.Being new in the business if you serve stale food it would be difficult to last long in business.My one star is for serving stale rice for an otherwise amazingly tasty main course."}
{"text":"We are so happy the reopened at this new location. Atmosphere is casual, nice bar and a good variety of local and domestic beers.

I get the Chicken Tikki Masala most every time. It is absolutely my go to and their spicy version is just right. The chicken Korma is really good as well.

Staff is always super friendly. If you are looking for the best Indian food, this is the place."}
{"text":"My wife and I attended a conference in Scottsdale recently and were delighted to find Nirvana nearby on Yelp.  Not only was the service good but the food was plentiful and delicious!  I like the heat medium and my wife likes mild and both were done to right spiciness which doesn't always happen.  
Only thing that worried me is that on a Saturday night,  it wasn't that busy. 
I realize that Indian food is a niche market and most Indian restaurants are not too busy.  That is OK for service,  but I hope this restaurant has enough business that it stays open since the food is fantastic.
We'll find a reason to stop by Nirvana again if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian buffet! Very wide variety is served. They even include a mango lassi and garlic naan as part of their buffet, this is a first for us when going to an Indian restaurant. Definitely a nice touch! The staff was very friendly and we had great service. Restaurant was clean and has a nice cozy environment."}
{"text":"Best Indian cuisine for the price in the area!
$9.95 +tax for lunch buffet, and a decent amount of absolutely delicious items to choose from. I thought I reviewed this place before as Nirvana but I guess not. They used to be Indian Paradise on Hayden/Northsight further south. SO HAPPY the restaurant has been continued! Service is spot on. The only complaint is one dish had a bit too much salt. Sorry can't remember which. The Inside Skinny is..... MANGO CHUTNEY!
Truly, Nirvana is Nirvana!"}
{"text":"Expensive, small portions for dinner and ok food. They stick pre-cook d blocks of dry chicken in the curry, not something you expect with India food. Masala was somewhat flavorful. Service is fairly good, better than many Indian restaurants. Wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Wonderful food.  Weekend lunch buffet is awesome, but from the menu is great too!"}
{"text":"I've tried dozens of Indian restaurants over the years because I always order the same thing trying to find the perfect one; chicken tikka masala. This dish is made perfectly - from the sauce to the chicken to the giant side of rice that comes with it. I've only been to one other place where I previously lived that makes it as well as this one, so I'm glad I found this place. Looking forward to trying all the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Buffet was good, veg and non-veg meals were nicely spiced, and seemed fresh.

Two peeves that would prevent me from returning:

1) My 8 year old was with us, she basically ate rice, but we were charged for a full buffet meal (~$12). While that is completely valid for the restaurant to do that, our usual go-to Indian place down charges to either a kids buffet price or just the cost of rice. 
2) The batch of naan slices that came out was visibly and obviously under cooked (dough on the inside), and I am surprised no one caught that. I did mention that to the waiter.

So, it was OK, but I think we will stick to our usual place."}
{"text":"Hello Yelp Readers:  I am reviewing Nirvana Indian Cuisine, formerly Indian Paradise Restaurant.  
My husband and I had visited Indian Paradise Restaurant at the old location at least once per month for quite some time.  The food was consistent, tables and the buffet station was clean, and service was always adequate and pleasant.  
The new location provides a full bar, more seating, but the quality of the lunch buffet has gone downhill.  
When we arrived at 1:30 PM the tandoor chicken was out on the buffet (none left), the chicken curry had only sauce in the buffet pan, and the tiki masala chicken had no chicken in the buffet pan.  
Fried foods were dry and had been sitting out (old tasting) and not maintained at temperature.  
The rice was sticky and hard to get out of the pot.  
The mango yogurt drink was luke warm and watered down.  
The buffet stations were dirty with spilled sauce, rice all over the table the rice cooker was on, and the floor in front of the buffet stations was wet and dirty.
The bathroom were also very unkept and dirty.
The floor and tables in the restaurant were also dirty.
I made the waiter aware the food was out at the buffet station and he said they would bring more out.  
So, we waited, and eventually more food came out, but they only serve lunch until 2:30 PM and you better believe at 2:30 PM that was it - - so we could not enjoy our lunch as we had intended because by the time the replenishment food arrived it was close to closing time.  
The naan served had garlic and herbs and was a good portion and had good flavor.  The naan was also good at their old location, this means the only item which generated consistency from one location to the other was the naan.
We got water with our meal.  The waitress had brought our bill to our table while we were eating.  No one asked us if we would like anything else before bringing the bill.  So, I got up, found the waitress and asked for a cup of hot tea.  She promptly came to our table to retrieve our bill for two lunch buffets and brought back a bill with the tea added to it.  I was very surprised she would do this, after we had to wait for food to be brought out to the buffet table and then scooted out due to it being close to 2:30 PM, the least they could have done was give me the hot cup of tea (only one cup) with their apologies!  
Even the hot tea was served in a much smaller cup and the price went up from their previous location.    
Regrettably, although old fans, we will NOT be returning.
Sorry Nirvana owner and staff members . . . there is much for you to do in order to survive long term at your new location."}
{"text":"We stopped here for the lunch buffet and really enjoyed it. Everything was labeled gluten free if it was and they even brought us gluten free cracker bread instead of naan. They did not have chicken tikka masala but did have paneer tikka masala so that was good. A lot more vegetarian dishes than meat dishes but my daughter loved that. Only complaint was the food was not as hot as it could've been. But I think my husband and I will go back and try their dinner. Cute place and great service!"}
{"text":"Great example of an excellent Indian buffet. Clean, comfortable, and great decor. The service was fast and efficient. Loved it!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Veggie samosas, palak paneer, chicken korma, naan, galub jamun, and mango lassi were all fantastic! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I dropped by today to have the lunch buffet.  Nirvana is the former Indian Paradise which was located on Hayden.  It was my favorite indian restaurant so I made it my business to find their new location if there was one.  Fortunately they relocated on Northsight so I breathed a sigh of relief.   
The buffet was varied, fresh and of course delicious. It included veggie dishes, salad items, rice, soup, and chicken dishes.  Many vegetarian options.  We were served fresh bread which I believe had a hint of garlic.  My hubby loved it. I tried the mango lassi for the first time and really enjoyed it.  
I spoke to the owner, Anjeli, who was happy to see us again but not as happy as we were to be at her new place.  She was a delight to speak to.  This is one of the great things about this restaurant--the owners are attentive and focussed on customer service.  I hope everyone rushes to Nirvana as a new restaurant needs a lot of customers to make it a success."}
{"text":"Food is great, service is great! I recommend this restaurant for someone looking for an Indian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Fabulous buffet of exotic treats, some very spicy, Many veggie options! Incredible value."}
{"text":"I must saying finding authentic, good Indian food is hard to accomplish! We have tried several restaurants in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, and this is the only one we have come back to several times! Our favorites are the samosas, chicken biryani, chicken tikka, chicken tikka masala, and the garlic naan is a MUST! the flavors are so delicious, the portions are great, always enough for lunch the next day & they have friendly and very attentive service! The lunch buffet is a great way to taste an assortment of foods they offer, definitely would recommend for anyone looking for great Indian food!"}
{"text":"Been to the place more than a few times in a very short span of time. Attended the grand opening which was amazing. Excellent music and very reasonably priced drinks. A very out of the box Friday night. The delicious food made me go to Nirvana again for dinner, twice. Not many indian restaurants here have the authentic taste of the cuisine, Nirvana surely does. Me and my friends have tried different dishes every time and have always been blown away with the amazing taste, so much so that I have a watering mouth while writing this review. The staff is super friendly. The owner, Anjali is extremely warm hearted. It's always a delight to see her smiling face. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the lunch buffet. Simply, they live up to their name!  You will not be disappointed! Good for them!"}
{"text":"This place blew away my expectations! Everything was delicious. The mango lassi was so good. I'm a vegetarian and they had plenty of options on the buffet for lunch. The restaurant was bright, clean, and airy.  There are lots of regulars that go here--we ran into a few while trying to decide on which dessert to get."}
{"text":"My first time having Indian food. I will definitely be back.  Great food great service and nice people. Came for lunch and want to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! High recommend the Vegetable Samosa and the Chicken Tikka Masala! I have tried many other place in the valley and this place is my favorite! The staff is courtesy and nice, the food is even better."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. Really happy to have the Indian Paradise group open this new restaurant. Absolutely worth coming."}
{"text":"Second to naan, Nirvana is definitely my preference for Indian food in the valley. Just be careful of the korma after the meal. Lassi what I can think of for this review- 

For 10-12 dollhairs (weekday vs weekend), the lunch buffet has a wide variety of non-veg and vegetarian options. They generally switch up the dishes so it's not always the same dishes. They are consistently serving some of my favorite options, such as the tandoori chicken, chicken curry, and biryani. Plus, unlimited naan! Desserts here are also really yummy. Kheer is a rice pudding and has became one of my favorite desserts. My absolute favorite thing at Indian buffets is the mango lassi. However, they have the tiniest styrofoam cups for the mango lassi. I have no shame so I grab 12 of them. On weekends, the chai tea and the champagne come with the meal! Angeli and her team do a phenomenal job making sure each customer enjoys their experience. Huge fan of this place and highly recommend it! 

Protip: They usually have yelp check-in offers. The more reasons to yelp! They have had with 20% off the bill in the past and buy a $50 dollar gift card with an extra $10 gift card."}
{"text":"Best Indian Food in town!!! Better yet, an awesome family run restaurant. Great place...you have to eat here."}
{"text":"Went it on 6/17/18 for lunch. Prices on the window said $11.95 on weekends and $9.95 weekdays. We were charged $12.95 for \"fathers day buffet\". Didn't see it until I got home as they probably knew most wouldn't catch it. The buffet was the same as the last two times I went. Nothing special, barely worth the $12 but to charge an extra dollar on every customer today and not post this is fraud.  Why not temporarily cover the real price? Pretty shady way to make an extra few bucks. Do they do this every chance they get? What else will they do for money? I hope it was worth it because you lost a customer over $2. Mint is just down the street on Shea and Pima."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian place in N. Scottsdale! They have awesome custom curries, and plenty of gluten free, vegan, and vegetarian options. They're well priced and have a $10 lunch buffet on weekdays. They're roti is vegan, which is an awesome option outside of naan!"}
{"text":"We visited Nirvana based on the favorable yelp reviews.  Did not even know the restaurant was there.

We ordered chicken masala, saag, vegetable curry and a yellow lentil dish along with roti and naan.  Everything was tasty and well flavored.  

Service was excellent as everyone working was very friendly and attentive to our table.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the buffet alone! One of the best hangover cures (ok fine not so much cure, more like tradition) in my experience is finding a great Indian buffet and eating yourself downright silly. There's a rotation of five or six curries, vindaloos, and masalas (some vegetarian, of course); chutneys and sides; rice (and naan if you ask for it -- definitely do); and mango lassi! They try to limit your lassi intake with tiny styrofoam cups, but that's why we have two hands.

Of course, the food -- the buffet is about as good as I've had as far as Indian buffets. I did have dinner here once or twice; I'd say it was quite good (a notch above buffet food, as should be expected) and scratched that curry itch but was not spectacular.

The servers and staff are awesome and very friendly, which was especially appreciated when I came in with a large group (8+) spontaneously after our reservation at another nearby restaurant (cough Carrabba's cough) was completely disrespected. The interior is super spacious, almost oddly so to be honest, but it's obviously not a problem. There's also some outdoor seating for some hangover-cure Indian lunch buffet action.

Great place, would (and did) recommend."}
{"text":"I've eaten in many of the Indian restaurants in Scottsdale and Phoenix. Some are better than  others. But none can compare with Nirvana.  The taste of the dishes, the variety -- chicken, lamb, fish, vegetarian --, the wonderful cheerfulness and attentive service of the help as well as the atmosphere makes this place a totally delightful dining experience.  Just enjoyed their buffet for the first time even though I had frequented the old Indian Paradise for several years.  Categorically, this is the best buffet where I have had the pleasure of spending my 10 bucks (Tues.-Fri., weekend $12.  Not an advertisement).  There is nothing I can say that would warrant anything less than 10 stars, rather than just the 5 they so richly deserve. I do not usually write reviews but the fact that they just moved in (former landlord just kicked them out of Hayden location, literally) prompted me to at least give them a shout-out. Yes, I would like to interest other people in trying this truly fine restaurant to ensure its success. The quality of the food is a reflection of the outstanding service and the people-oriented owners. I would be surprised if anyone gave less than 5 stars to Nirvana."}
{"text":"Just picked up a catering order for our holiday party and the food was phenomenal!!! Thank you so much for the quick turnaround given short notice. My team members loved the Chicken Tikka and Paneer Chili! We'll be back in two weeks for our New Year's Party!!! :)"}
{"text":"We used to Love Indian Paradise, we are very excited they have moved and become Nirvana. The food is as good or better then before. They have a lot of the same friendly staff and their lunch buffet has expanded. The restaurant is much more open, bright, and very clean. Probably the best part is they now have an outdoor patio and an easier to get to location."}
{"text":"Great service. Everything was delicious. Had the samosas and the onion naan and the the tofu coconut curry. Will come again !"}
{"text":"Our first dinner at Nirvana was.... Nirvana.  (I just had to)  The service was outstanding, the food amazing and the cost was affordable.  We can highly recommend the Chicken Biryani, Dosas, and Chicken Tikka Masala.  I can't wait to try the lunch buffet next!"}
{"text":"strictly average food.
The only thing above average was their aaloo chole chaat appetizer. Portions were bigger than expected.  I was expecting their north indian selection to be more flavor full."}
{"text":"Beautiful place and absolutely delicious food. Very tasty with authentic flavors. The chicken and lamb masala with medium spice were perfect. Portions are good size. The samosa appetizers are fresh and definite favorite. The naan basket with regular, butter and garlic is nearly addictive it was so good."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I was there for lunch with a co-worker. We had the buffet. The food had rich complex flavors. Personally, I ate way too much food. The flavors were just too good. The only negative comment I have is overall decor and environment could use some help. The atmosphere was a bit cold and unwelcoming and the lighting was weird. It seemed as though they had just moved into the space and didn't pay attention to the decor."}
{"text":"The food is the best.  Excellent service. A gem.  Loved the bread, appetizers, 2 different  vegetables dishes."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Tandoori chicken was very tasty.  Garlic Naan  but the best was the tikka biryani.  Lamb was ok.  Very friendly waiter."}
{"text":"Whenever I go there, they are always nice and the food is amazing! This is then only place where I eat Indian food. Thank you for being so friendly guys!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food restaurant ever!!!! 

I was so distraught after they shut down the last location and thought they went out of business... However a few months later I learned they just opened under a new name and new location.

Everything is fabulous here!! We love the Palak Paneer, chicken tiki masala, vegetable korma, chicken Mahkni, daal, tandoori chicken and anything on the menu!! 

Their food is completely amazing!! I highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here about 2:30 on a Sunday for their lunch buffet.  Still had a few table of customers and we were happy to find that the buffet still had hot and fresh food.  Place was clean and the staff was friendly.  Love that they bring out fresh naan to each table, food was good quality and delicious.  We live in Gilbert, so just wish this was closer to home."}
{"text":"Eh....not a very authentic place.  Taste was fine but not sure if they even have a tandoor as Naan seemed pan fried.  Tadka Dahl seemed a day old and dry as well.

Not gonna go back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian Food in Scottsdale. I always get the appetizer assortment, and the chicken tikka masala is the best I've ever had. I always ask for a little bit extra of their wonderful chutney and they always generously give me a few more little cups of the sauces."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch buffet! I particularly liked the Chili Chicken they had today, as well as the chicken tiki masala. They also had this really good mango dessert type drink that came with the buffet that was quite tasty.

Staff was very kind and came by multiple times offering more bread and refills.

This will be a favorite lunch spot for the foreseeable future!"}
{"text":"Party of 7 for a College Graduation. Delicious food, good price, good service. Will return!"}
{"text":"Great selection during their buffet ranging from tandoori chicken to a variety of curries. Good vegetarian options included as well as sweet dishes. Flavors were good, spice level was low/medium."}
{"text":"Not what they used to be. Their lunch buffet needs some work. Their rice is no longer made from the good long grain basmati rice, it's the same spices but with the crappy minute rice. Terrible! They no longer offer the pakora masala at lunch, and several other items. The food is just not the same quality it was when they were off Hayden and Raintree area. So disappointed since I loved that place!"}
{"text":"We ordered the garlic naan, chicken Marsala and and chicken tiki, spicy. It was absolutely amazing!! It was very spicy, but we both enjoyed the heat level. The staff was very friendly and attentive as well. We are not from Scottsdale, but would come back into town just to have this food again!!"}
{"text":"I would rate this place 4.5 stars. 
Visited this place on a crowded Friday night. 
Ordered - 
Tandoori Panner: Tasted delicious and spice levels were perfect.
MalaiKofta : This is probably the one the best places that makes a good Kofta curry. I have to admit, it was cooked to perfection.
Naan: This place serves you unique naan. Unique in terms of flour they use which is not the same soggy naan you get at other places.

Decent ambience with patio service, good Bollywood music and quick service made my Friday night the best.
Would totally love to visit this place sometime for their Buffet , biryani and local beers."}
{"text":"Consistent food - a little small for what you pay for, and not much actual meat in the lamb dishes. But done flavorfully. Mixed pickles and mango chutney are $3.00 for a very small portion - but very tasty."}
{"text":"Nirvana Indian Cuisine is my favorite restaurant in The Valley, and I am a certified foodie. Delicious food, bright atmosphere, incredible lunch buffet and great service. You really need to try it. Wonderful in every way."}
{"text":"Really good! A friend and I got a few things to split and everything has great flavor and big portions. The service is amazing too! Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"I had my food delivered and it was fairly cold. The food itself was just okay. Not bad, but not remarkable. I see this place get great reviews so maybe my experience is just a bad day for them. I'd be willing to try again."}
{"text":"Second times here and still as good as the first time eating here. Great selections of Indian food: Tandoori Chicken (quarter legs marinated with yogurt, garlic, ginger & authentic spices then grilled), Chicken Curry (chicken cuts with onion, ginger and combination of fresh ground spices), Anda Bhurji (seasoned scrambled eggs), Chicken Dum Biryani (seasoned chicken cooked with rice), Mushroom Matar (green peas cooked in a creamy onion based gravy with mushroom and fresh ground spices), Daal Tadka (yellow lentil slow cooked with cumin seed, tomatoes, chopped ginger and traditional spices), Daal Makhni (dark lentil slow cooked with onion, garlic and tomatoes with fresh ground spices), Mirchi Pakora (green chiles dipped in flavored flour then fried), Spinach Pakora (chopped fresh spinach dipped in flavored flour then fried), Chana Chaat (seasoned garbanzo beans with fresh cut onions, tomatoes and cilantro), and variety of sauces. Desserts are: Mango Lassi (milk prepared yogurt, sugar and mango), Mango Custard (fresh assorted fruits with tapioca), Kheer (rice pudding cooked with cashews, cinnamon and cardamom). On top of all of those delicious options, there are almost unlimited Naan. Great service and attentive, they always keep the place clean. Have not tried dinner buffet yet. Also my friend ordered from the menu: Goat Biryani and she said it was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food and great service--what more could we ask for?  We ordered three curries--a traditional curry, a sag paneer and a red curry, garlic naan, samosas, and a tikka masala.  Plenty of food for my family of six.  Our kids ages 4 through 12 loved it as well.  Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Today I ventured into this restaurant located in a somewhat non-descript strip mall. 
I am glad I did. 
Good Indian food is difficult to find in North Scottsdale. And this place fills a big opportunity for these restaurateurs. 
The food was just exceptional. I ordered the Chef's Tandoori platter and literally pigged out. I brought back the leftovers for a late night snack. 
The lamb, chicken, kabab were cooked to perfection. I ordered it spicy (I am a glutton for punishment) but I would not have it any other way. 
The wait staff was very friendly, courteous and prompt. 
I loved the music they played. Instrumentals of old Indian hits which is so appropriate when you are enjoying good Indian food. 
So why not 5 Stars. I have a small bone to pick with management and I wanted to discuss that directly with them before discussing it in an open forum. I have already written to them and am sure they will respond. 
All in all a great addition to the Indian Food roster in North Scottsdale.

Quick update:
Management was very prompt in getting in touch with me and amicably resolving the misunderstanding. So 5 Stars!!!"}
{"text":"Great buffet lunch here.

I don't particularly like buffet style as I have to keep getting up but for great food like they have here, I don't mind getting up!

I came here for a weekend lunch the other day. Arriving 45 minuets before closing time, I wasn't sure if they still offer buffet, and I was prepared to order from their menu if they let me.

Buffet was still available and plenty of them. In fact, they brought more food while we were there. They close between lunch and dinner but they kept plenty of food available so close to their lunch closing time.

Service was very friendly, credit card accepted. 

Food was so good, can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"I think I have a love buzz for this restaurant. Even if you don't like Indian food, there is no reason to stay away. Come as you are and walk away with the most wonderful food coma, just make sure you're ready for a lounge act.

The lunch buffet, very reasonably priced at $9.95 + tax on weekdays and $11.95 + tax on weekends, is an excellent array of Indian cuisine. They offer multiple vegetarian options with mixed veggies, aloo mutter, daal makhni, paneer Tikka masala and palak paneer. The paneer Tikka masala is a must! It's very creamy and nicely spiced. Meat dishes include chicken makhni, chicken curry and shahi anda (egg dish). Curd rice is available for those that need something a bit creamier to minimize the spice, but there are other biryani options for those that want some more spice. In addition to the spicy pickle and other sides, there are fresh cucumber and tomatoes that comprise the Indian equivalent of a salad. You can get the spicy tomato soup if you're feeling a bit cold too, but I've personally never been a huge fan. 

And finally, the most amazing thing here that I've never experienced at any other Indian buffet is mango Lassi! Usually a mango Lassi costs around $4, and still does on Nirvana's dinner menu, but it's included in the lunch buffet. Sooooo amazing.

Pack on your plate and go back to your table where there will likely be fresh garlic naan waiting for you! Most buffets do normal naan, so the garlic naan is another really nice touch. 

Seriously, can't say enough good things about this restaurant. Extremely worth it to check out. Check in on Yelp too as there may be some promotion!"}
{"text":"This place is yummy! The masalas are excellent. Lots of great vegetarian and vegan options. The naan wasn't great, it was crispy but that was the only thing we didn't like. Service was excellent as well. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Summary
This place has been on my radar for a while. I tried quite a few Indian buffets in Phoenix/Scottsdale area and this one is definitely amongst the top 3. 

Comparison with other Indian buffets
You might not find as many options you'll find at Haldi (on E Bell Rd), but all the items available here are delicious. Also keep in mind the price point - $12.99 is not bad for a Sunday lunch buffet.

Buffet
The Mysore bajji is delicious (lentil balls in the picture). Goat curry was well cooked and tasted great. We were served with the choice of naan and Garlic naan is the best. Relish your meal with a side of Mango lassi (many restaurants do not offer Mango lassi as part of the buffet)

Service
Great service and the owner/staff were constantly checking to see if we needed anything. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We went there for Sunday lunch and I would say it was really a treat.. Very good food especially chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken, the kheer was awesome. In total the food was worth the cost. Looking forward to visit again."}
{"text":"Great Indian flavors, fresh, and good quality.
They tagged Vegan options, which is a huge plus for an Indian restaurant. I usually struggle to order non-dairy vegetarian dishes in Indian restaurants, but this place made me feel like I am eating safe food. Madras curry with vegetables, and it was great. The naan and paratha was really well made too. Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch buffet! Nice shady patio! I would come here every day if I could! We were so sad when Indian Paradise closed, now we are happy to see their new location still close by!"}
{"text":"If you love Indian Food, check this place out. 

Indian Paradise closed and reopened here. 
Buffet is 9.99 and is very tasty. Lots of vegetarian choices. 

Glad to have found you after you moved."}
{"text":"Great buffet and Sunday brunch. Flavorful and great customer service. Prices aren't bad. If you ever want to experience indian meal and tastes variety flavors of India, Nirvana buffet can offer that. It's kids and family friendly. I would like to see more options of indian desserts. That's something we didn't get to experience that day."}
{"text":"We came last night with a group of 12. Service was excellent and the food also! They made the Chicken Tikka fresh which you could tell immediately. Some indian restaurants just reheat old dried up chicken. I have stop going to some indian restaurants because the quality was not up to par and not fresh but Nirvana seems to cook everything fresh."}
{"text":"The other day I had a craving for Indian food and invited a business colleague to join me.  We looked on Yelp for a spot and discovered that a new spot opened up.  Immediately upon walking in, we were greeted by super friendly people.  Imagine that?  

The restaurant is super clean, well-lit and they offer an all-you-can-eat buffet.  It is about $10-12 and is packed with all kinds of yummy looking food.  Being the ever adventurous eater, I tried almost everything.  I liked about 90% of the food.  The other 10% was probably really delicious to people that understand Indian food.  I don't, as I've only enjoyed Indian food about a dozen times.

Nirvana offers a great covered patio in the front.  Seeing that they are directly located next to a large gym, there is plenty of people watching out front. 

Nirvana has plenty of parking and they are conveniently located on the corner of Raintree and Hayden.

The naan is delicious!  The people rock. The food is high quality and inexpensive... OK, no \"teen spirit\" jokes.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great menu and true authentic Indian food. If you are not used to eating Indian Food frequently make sure you tell them lighter than MIlD for spices. Jeesh I could not handle my meal at all. Nevertheless the service is amazing and fast. Everything is made to and hot and fresh. Give them a try"}
{"text":"We were so bummed to hear Indian Paradise had closed, and excited when we found they had simply moved up the road a bit and changed their name. The food is just as delicious, and the restaurant is new and bright and easy to get to. Uber Eats delivers too. Our favorite go-to for authentic Indian food."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner! Great food and drink! Excellent service! We had the mix appetizer which was perfect to split! Then the lamb Khorma and lamb madras both were excellent! Great bar and music. Nice decor! Would strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Formerly \"Indian Paradise\", they relocated down the street and brought all of their delicious food with them. While in transition, I searched for a replacement Indian restaurant in the area and all of the other restaurants I tried were terrible. I rejoiced when Nirvana reopened, and it is my go-to Indian restaurant at least once a week. Everything is delicious and the prices are reasonable. The Buffet is great too."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Scottsdale. I love this place. The staff are wonderful and always so friendly. The portions are great for what you pay. I usually order the chicken tikka masala,  but sometimes I get the goat which is also excellent. The sauce is perfect, just enough spice (and more if you want). The naan bread was cooked perfectly. I would highly recommend the garlic naan. The basmati rice is fantastic and served in generous portions. Definitely check this place out if you like authentic indian food. I look forward to going back many many times."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always amazing. Lunch or dinner, you can't go wrong. Even my picky eater is happy to come here."}
{"text":"A few shakes too much from the MSG shaker pretty much made the main dishes inedible. Soggy naan tasted like it had been made days ago. Very bland rice. The samosa were the only thing that we enjoyed.  I left a nice tip on my bill, more than 25% on a $40 tab because I am too nice that way, not because the service or food were stellar, but when I checked my bank statement, there was about $10 or $11 more added than what the total should have been. This has never happened to me anywhere else and I surely hope it was a mistake, and not that the waiter felt entitled to a 50% tip just because he had to pick up a few crumbs from my kid off the floor. I certainly hope these people are better than to deliberately stoop that low. Really there are much better Indian restaurants out there. I am very confused why this one is rated so high."}
{"text":"Formerly Indian Paradise, same owner different location and different name. 

Delicious authentic Indian food located diagonal from Butters Pancakes on North Northsight blvd.

Serve delicious buffet lunch daily as well as a la carte.

Very nice owner and staffs. Most of all, we were so happy that these guys reopen the restaurant because we love their food and we are loyal customers.

Thank you Nivana!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food I have ever had.  Everything was excellent. Service, food. Order the vegetable samosas."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place! As soon as you walk in the door the flavors of India surround you! The buffet has so many wonderful choices and they keep it warm and well stocked.  The service is excellent, the nan bread keeps coming and the atmosphere is extremely pleasant. - Love this place!

Final Thought: A definite MUST try and add to my list place! Enjoy, I sure did!"}
{"text":"Good Indian cuisine
Good service
Reasonable price 
We'll be returning 
Good lamb Jafrezi"}
{"text":"It was a rainy day on Vday, and we were schedule to eat Indian food at another restaurant. Since it was further away, I ordered take out from here - which was also on my list to try. The food was ready before I got there, which was great. The food smelled delicious as well.

We ordered a Veggie Korma and Lamb Masala. The lamb was super tender, and the gravy was great. The veggies were nice in the korma(peas, broccoli, potatoes). All the right scent and flavor was on every bite. Delicious! The price was pretty standard as well so nothing surprising. 

We enjoyed it, and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"It was ok I expected a little better. Maybe I'm just picky or spoiled but Marigold Maison and Taj Mahal are my two favorite. I just feel like the quality here is so so. I wish I liked it more. The variety was amazing on the buffet and the naan was really good."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst Indian food I've had in a long time. 
The Naan was undercooked, and the food tasted like it had been cooked by someone who has no knowledge of indian spices.
Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Nirvana and i was very impressed with the variety and quality of food.

Lunch buffet had tandoori chicken, chicken curry, chicken tikka masala, paneer, eggplant, veg biryani, dal makhni, rasmalai, moong dal halwa and mango lassi to name a few.
Fresh naan bread was served at the table.

The staff was attentive constantly clearing the plates and asking for feedback on the food.

Buffet is priced at $10 on weekdays.
Can't wait to try the weekend fare.

Cheers!"}

At Nirvana Indian Cuisine, there's no need to dress to the nines for their lunch buffet, just Come As You Are. The cost for weekday lunch will only Drain You of about $10 and includes fresh naan and mango lassi with your buffet items. 

The first thing I noticed when I walked into the restaurant was that it didn't quite Smell Like Teen Spirit. It had some strange funk to it, like there was Something in the Way of a clear pipe system, perhaps some plumbing problem gone awry, but only a faint whiff of it. The food at the buffet smelled good at least so I stuck it out and after a while I didn't notice it too much.

The spread was pretty nice. There was a good variety of meat and vegetable dishes. I think all of the meat dishes were chicken. Some examples include chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, and tandoori chicken. For the most part I enjoyed the meaty dishes although there was one (I think called chicken majestic?) that wasn't too majestic for me since the batter on it was a bit soggy tasting and was way too salty for my tastes. Vegetable dishes included saag paneer, green beans, mushroom curry, and dal makhani. Next to the trays there's also a section with fried battered items. I was excited to see the cut mirchi label but when I looked at the corresponding contents it looked more like battered and fried cauliflower instead of chilies. As for the heat level, it was mild to medium for me. No need to worry that your mouth will feel like a Lake of Fire after dining here!

The naan came out freshly made, piping hot. It looked amazing! It was a buttered and cilantro(?) topped concoction. It had more of a crisp taste to it and not as pliable as other naan I've had in the past, which is not a bad thing at all, just different. It was such a huge portion too. I was sad I wasn't able to finish all of it and since it was a buffet I wouldn't be able to take any home in a Heart Shaped Box.

Dessert was fairly simple. They had mango pudding and kheer/rice pudding when I was here. As for drinks, I enjoyed the unlimited mango lassi. I could drink a vat of that stuff if I had infinite stomach space! It's probably for the best that I didn't though. Who knows, I might have an Aneurysm from drinking so much lassi that it somehow clogs up my arteries!

Service was fast and friendly. When you are done dining you pay at the front counter. 

The one real negative for me was the disgusting bathroom. If you don't need to use it I'd Stay Away. The toilet was really nasty and didn't look like it had been cleaned in some time. It wouldn't surprise me if there was some bacteria that could easily Breed in there. There were no paper towels or air dryer to dry your hands with after washing them so I had to use the linty toilet paper. The floor looked like it hadn't been really cleaned either. Strangely enough, the bathroom smelled a lot nicer than the initial funky whiff of strangeness when I walked into the restaurant go figure lol.

Since there are limited options for Indian food in the North Scottsdale area, this buffet isn't bad at all food wise. The cost is reasonable and the food itself tasted good overall. With a bit of help in the cleaning department and aromatherapy area (Perhaps bringing in some fragrant flowers In Bloom) I'd definitely come back again!

P.S. On a related note, you know you're old when the rebellious grunge music you listened to when you were younger is now the background music you hear at the bank. A little All Apologies with your adjustable rate mortgage? A bit of Radio Friendly Unit Shifter with your right of rescission? Some Pennyroyal Tea with your payoff statement? Why yes apparently!"}
{"text":"Went here for first time xmas eve and got takeaways. When i got home i discovered they did not include the rice so i called and she said she will remember me and come back for a credit. 
Well i finally made
It back here and got another takeaway order. They made good on the prev mishap. 
The food is excellent and the staff are all lovely. 
I will be a regular as I adore Indian food and they serve quality food at Nirvana."}
{"text":"Really good choices on the lunch buffet. Many of the spicy in a good way. I always appreciate it when they have descriptions of the dishes like they have here. I know what most of the dishes were still alot of them look the same. Make sure to check-in on yelp to get 20% off your first visit check."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here last week and enjoyed a nice dinner on the patio watching the sunset.  We had the Tikka Chicken and Chicken Biryani.  Both were very good and even my boyfriend who doesn't usually eat Indian food was impressed.  The owner had the waiter bring us over complimentary garlic naan which was very nice.  We will definitely be back to try the buffet!"}
{"text":"Great food and super service.  Family used to own Indian Paradise and moved a short distance to open this restaurant.  We sat on their outdoor patio and it was great."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and has finally reopened! We were shocked when they closed and tried finding a new place but none were as good as this place. Simply the best!! They are taking phone orders now and plan to open officially at the end of September. Best Indian out here!!"}
{"text":"Really good food. We got a few different dishes for take out. 2 adults and 2 kids. It was way too much food but it was very tasty. 
Definitely made fresh. Great recipes. Staff was very nice but should have told us we had ordered enough food to feed half of Hyderabad. 
Will be going back to eat on site next time and try more options."}
{"text":"Yes!  Indian Paradise back at it again under a new roof and new name!  The new digs are great and the food - delicious as it ever was.  Garlic naan served in a basket hot and fresh.  Buffet has a nice variety of dishes...  looking forward To coming back again!"}
{"text":"Very nice  Great service.
I don't know if Nirvana is family run, but it certainly feels like it.
Mrs and I began with two complimentary papadums. Lamb biryani for me, saag paneer for her. One Roti, a glass of storytelling wine completed our night
Just all around excellent."}
{"text":"Had the lunch buffet. Great tandoori chicken & masala for a good price."}
{"text":"Exceptional food. A couple of items we'd never had, especially fried yogurt balls. The mango rice pudding was a winner. The goat was very tasty. The nan stands out. This was a buffet, but the staff were attentive. By the way, they offer mango lassi on the buffet, which is exceptional deal. By the way the ambulance is pleasant if unexceptional. The price for Saturday lunch, $12. Great value and there's a Groupon deal. Enjoy and afford."}
{"text":"Buffet had good selection and the taste was good the only problem was the food was cold. I told the staff but nothing was done to solve the problem. So if you're going for the buffet you want to check the temperature first as Indian food does not do well when it's cold. The service was really good and location is convenient."}
{"text":"Great Indian food.  I've been here for the lunch buffet, which has a great assortment of authentic Indian dishes.  Great chicken paneer dish.  Includes mango lassi.   Only problem is eating too much because it tastes  so good!"}
{"text":"Nice little Indian restaurant that opened up in the neighborhood. Not too many Indian spots in this neighborhood so it's nice to see. They have a daily buffet with about 15 items on it price is $10 including naan but no drink. Food was well-prepared with good spice and nice side items as well. I came a little late I would suggest coming before 1pm to get the freshest items."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place for Saturday afternoon lunch buffet.  Oh, and champagne!  Everything we tried was super.  So glad Nirvana joined the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch buffet. My favorite is the mango lassi drink and the chicken 65. Staff is very friendly and attentive. Place is very clean and nice. Food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"BEST INDIAN FOOD IN TOWN!
 Service is always prompt and accurate, they are all about the guest and making sure we get exactly what we want. 

My husband and I have had Indian food from all over the city and this wins 10 times over. If I could give it 6 stars I would!!! Love love love"}
