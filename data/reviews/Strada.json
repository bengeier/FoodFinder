{"text":"Yuuuuuum! What a tasty delicious treat Strada served me today! Noodles and a tortilla! can't get much better than that on a Sunday afternoon. I honestly would've rather had a turd sandwich than what I ate today. Don't go here you're welcome"}
{"text":"If this were any other business, I'd probably give it three stars, but since it's on campus it definitely deserves four! Memorial Union has done a great job revamping the food options on campus, especially since they've put some emphasis on local foods (although I'm not sure if Strada serves local). A make-your-own pizza place with options for italian-syle burritos is a genius way to keep students coming in to fuel up before studying etc. They have a huge variety of options, with meat ranging from chicken to salami to steak and veggies varying from arugula to snow peas to mushrooms! And I must say, I'm absolutely thrilled by the fact that you can get angel hair spaghetti in your sandwich. Mind=blown. However, the ingredients aren't labeled, so it's hard to try to ask for what you want on a build-your-own. I also had issues with the wrap for the piadina... it honestly just tasted like flour. It would be awesome if the managers here could work on finding a tastier wrap that still has a stretchy texture to make the huge burrito-like sandwiches. I hope it gets better!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly, this is some of the very best thin crust (somewhat Neapolitan-style) pizza in Madison. Custom made to order and very inexpensive at under $8. Super delicious and just very well-made. Definitely recommend the pesto pizza."}
{"text":"I had heard so many things about Strada from other people and I was excited to try it.
You can create a salad or a pizza. They also have pre-made lists/types that you can choose from. I went ahead and ordered a Build Your Own Pizza with up to 6 toppings. 

I got the Red Pesto sauce, Mozarella Blend, Chicken, Sausage, Pepperoni, Garlic, Mushrooms, and Mozarella Slices. They told me, \"it will only be 5 minutes.\"

5 minutes. 
I could not believe it. 

It came out and it was piping hot. You can eat at one of the tables there or get it in a box to-go. Next time i'll have to try the salad line.

The Pizza was AMAZING. I added crushed red pepper and Parmesan to it too. It's thin crust which makes it cook faster and the stone oven can cook so many pizzas. They also offer gluten free crusts and put it in the oven with it's own foil liner and let everyone know that a GF pizza is going in so people can keep non GF pizzas away from it. AMAZING. 

What a great place to take friends and families (kid friendly) when you are visiting the Memorial Union. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hearth-fired pizza, flatbread piadinas, pasta or salad bowls made to order. Either pick one of their signature dishes or build your own. I did a build-your-own pizza. I didn't quite understand the piadinas as I was seeing it being made, but maybe next time. Build your own pizza was pretty easy. Steps are: 
1. Select a Sauce 
2. Pick A Protein
3. Choose Your Cheese
4. Add Toppings
Cheese Pizza starts at $6.00, add a topping then it's $6.75. Want more than one, then it's $7.75 but up to 6 toppings. Anymore than 6 than it's and additional $0.75 per topping.

So I told the cashier I wanted the build your own pizza and she asked how many toppings. I made the mistake of listing the toppings I wanted, but she just needed to know 1 topping or more than 6 so she can charge properly. So note: you pay for it before you make the pizza. So she ran my card and off to my creation I go. They didn't have any sauces, cheeses or any ingredients labeled, if so, it wasn't obvious or clear. Which took me a while because I didn't really know what I can order ahead of time. I figured maybe I can tell the ingredients or maybe they are labeled right at the window/sneeze guard. But that was not the case. I asked about their sauces and the one that caught my attention was \"this one is the spiciest\" - well of course I'm going for that. But just from visual (because it was hard to hear), I say there's a pesto, Parmesan, and classic marinara sauce in addition to the \"one that is the spiciest.\" 

Next step: Select your protein. There was one item that was actually labeled, the tofurkey sausage. And thank you for making sure that was labeled ;) Other proteins weren't labeled but there were some that need to be. So I got pepperoni and \"smoked\" sausage (not the grounded clumps). For the rest of the toppings, I had banana peppers and mushrooms. I wanted to get up to 6 toppings so I can try the various ingredients they offered but I was already taking enough time asking what the item in the middle to the left was...

Once I was down, they popped the pizza into this fiery pizza oven and before I knew it, my name was called. The pizza cooked a lot faster than the lines during the process (the line to order and the time to create your pizza). Overall, I liked my \"masterpizza\" - the made-to-order made it fresh. The crust is actually the size I prefer. Not too paper thin, like eating pizza toppings on a cracker but not thick where it feels like you're eating bread."}
{"text":"I went to work in the Union before a windsurfing class, and I didn't have time to make and bring a lunch (boo, I honestly hate having to buy lunch out). But, I loaded money on my wiscard so I can save 5% on purchases (woohoo!). I think I must've been the first customer of the day on a Wednesday around 11:30, and I got a \"signature pizza\"- the vegetarian blanco option and subbed basil in for arugula. It came out super fresh and perfectly cooked. I ate 3/4 of it for lunch and had leftovers for \"lupper,\" what I like to call my ~4 pm snack. The workers were willing to make any substitutions, and they were very nice and eager to help. I'd eat here again, especially for an on-campus, hot food option."}
{"text":"Stopped by here today while visiting the Union Memorial Terrace (which is totally beautiful btw), but you've just got your typical made to order college campus pizza place here. Nothing crazy spectacular and the prices are okay. The ingredients seem fresh enough and they give you a decent amount of toppings. It was great to be able to eat pizza next to a large body of water, especially since the weather was so beautiful. 

I got a made to order pizza and my sister got the Strada Bianca. Nothing fancy, but it hits the spot if you're craving pizza that isn't too heavily greasy."}
