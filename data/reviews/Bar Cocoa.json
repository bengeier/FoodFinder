{"text":"My favorite place in Charlotte to stop in for dessert. The cupcakes are amazing and well priced. They usually have a seasonal flavor so there are always new options. The gelato is really good as well and I love that you can get a mini cup, perfect size. Bar cocoa introduced me to macaroons, so many flavors to try!"}
{"text":"Had the petit entremet (white chocolate and chocolate mousse cake) and it was not like mousse at all. It must have had gelatin or something in it because it was more like jello than a fluffy mousse. It was not good and not worth the price."}
{"text":"I love their selection. Their macaroons are definitely worth it at $1.50 a piece. I also had their strawberry shortcake dessert which I thought was more on the pricier side but didn't taste as good as I expected.    I had a small tiramisu gelato and it was perfect for me as it wasn't too sweet but still tasty.  The atmosphere is nice and modern. For a sit down meal or tea/coffee/desserts, I would feel uncomfortable not dressing up. I decided to sit down just to finish the desserts and coffee since I ordered more than I should have and noticed many people were walking in (loud and obnoxious) and just strolling around in their general area. That sort of disrupted my mood to enjoy the rest of my dessert so I quickly finished and left.  The service was fine as I had ordered at the counter and paid there."}
{"text":"We were checking out and the cocoa wasn't open for another 20 minutes but Dani ran out and surprised us as we were waiting for our car at the ritz valet. I think she saw the sadness in our eyes when we found out that we might not get to taste their macaroons!!  5 stars to this place and 10 stars for service. Dani is a keeper we will come see you next time."}
{"text":"This place is downstairs in the Ritz-Carlton and sits on the corner of College and Trade. Let me say that it's beautiful eye candy. Punny. We stopped in and decided to have some chocolates after lunch and depending on the taste maybe a dessert. Well, let's just say we didn't have dessert. Had brownie batter walnut truffle--gross. Got a raspberry cheesecake truffle, also bad but not so much so, just to take away the nasty taste of chocolate #1. You don't get the feel that the staff is excited about their product or that they actually eat it.   If you want GREAT chocolate, locally produced with enthusiasm and integrity, go to the 7th Street Market and look for the barChocolate. I'm gonna write a review for them; went this morning."}
{"text":"An upscale,  trendy yet classy bakery with an attached   restaurant that was even more classy.  The workers behind the counter were very welcoming.  The atmosphere in the attached restaurant was very formal yet relaxing.  It is attached to the Ritz Carlton and does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Wait staff is too snooty. I don't know if he doesn't like Asians or having a bad day. My friend and I ordered a latte and 2cup cakes. The guy took forever even though it was xtremely slow.   Nevertheless, I enjoyed my latte and cup cake. Their prices was cheaper than most places. Cup cakes were moist and the frostings were not too sweet"}
{"text":"Thanks Dani! I went there a couple days ago with a coworker (his first time) and it was great. We each got a small gelato (Maple Bacon!) and then had a cupcake too. How could we not - they are so beautiful.  However, what made it really special was the great service we received from Dani. She had a smile on her face and made great conversation with us as we sampled a couple gelato flavors. She was the cherry on top of a great visit...yes, gelato/ice cream pun intended. Stop by Bar Cocao and visit Dani - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place can be delicious or just plain nasty in taste. I love sweets and stumbled into Bar Cocoa one cold night. I had couple of delicious French macarons (coconut, pistachio, and coffee) and one really pretty but really, really, really dry and oily red velvet cupcake...I know it sounds contradictory but it almost tasted like old cake that someone tried to revive by soaking it in melted butter and lard. The worst part was the service was awful. The guy behind the counter had the personality of the Grim Reaper. No smiles, treated customers like a 12 year old would treat chores (a lot of sighing and eye rolling).  Because the French macarons were so good I decided to stop by a month or two later while I was at a meeting uptown just to give Bar Cocoa a chance to redeem itself. Bad mistake! The macarons were so hard and dry I thought I was going to chip a tooth. Why some were dry, some were so soft they were almost mushy and tasted undercooked. The same guy was still there, with the same horrible service. No smile and not an ounce of personality. I mean c'mon now, you don't have to love your job but you have to make the best of it.  Coming from the Ritz, I would have expected them to be more picky when it came to choice of staff. The staff in the hotel itself is wonderful but the staff at Bar Cocoa needs improvement. I will not be back until things change."}
{"text":"The 92.5 sanitation score, definitely low for a 5 star hotel cafe. Great selection and the lady was quite helpful with my selection. Not impressed with the Ritz-Carlton Signature Cake, looked heavy, tasted heavy, and didn't care for the citrusy touch in it. Chocolate mousse on the other hand, looked heavy but it was quite light and not too sweet. The gelato were just okay. We tried hazelnuts and coffee gelato, and I think I still prefer the ones from Talenti."}
{"text":"The name and printed advertising is quite misleading. They are a simple chocolate shop, and not even quite exquisite in my opinion."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a hot day for an iced latte and a snack. Holy delicious macarons! I got a lemon basil macaron and an iced vanilla latte and it was all perfect. So many other kinds of desserts I wished I could have just stayed and sampled them all day."}
{"text":"Walked over for dessert and drinks after dinner at Flemings. Just loved the atmosphere in Bar Cocoa! the chocolate was the best and true to form, the service at the Ritz did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Very cute! Visited Friday evening and there was a very steady business. The girl working was polite and efficient. A great selection of desserts. The coffee looked great and we will probably be back in the morning to try it! Had sorbet which was great and then got macaroons and a chocolate mousse dessert to go."}
{"text":"After dinner at Blackfinns,we decided to walk around Charlotte for a bit.Being a chilly night,we stopped in for a hot chocolate for the walk back to our hotel.It didn't take long before we realized this tasty little gem was part of the Ritz Carlton Hotel and we could take our treats right down into the lounge!Great atmosphere made even more special with Christmas decorations!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quiet spot in uptown to have some coffee and sweets with friends I highly recommend bar cocoa. The atmosphere is very laid back with the lights dimmed, they have a nice seating area including couches and a waterfall. They have many cupcakes (which are made perfectly) gelato, macaroons, cakes ect. I got the vanilla bean cupcake with a cappuccino and I'd have to say the cupcake was one of a kind with the perfect consistency. They also have a bar for drinks (bar cocoa) lol and if you're wondering there is a waiter working the room if you need anything."}
{"text":"I had a cupcake from here a few days ago. Average at best. It's one of their cheaper items surprisingly. Their other items are a tad bit overpriced (yeah, you can call me a cheap-o). Good classy interior and counter people. Not sure if I'll stop in here again."}
{"text":"Had the bar cocoa while I was there. It was ok. The ice cream was good. The staff was really nice but not a place I would go again. It's a place I go in once just to try. The dessert look fancy"}
{"text":"Hands down my absolute favorite macarons in town! They're always freshly baked and perfectly infused with interesting flavors. My favorites have to be the raspberry currant and rose, but you honestly cannot go wrong. I particularly appreciate the subtle touch of details like a single golden flake here and there, and especially the vibrant burst of colors with every bite. I often give these as gifts and of course, Bar Cocoa does not underwhelm. Subtle, yet classic, the simple wrapping touches make for the perfect gift."}
{"text":"Stopped in to pick up a treat on my way home from the office last week... everything looked amazing.  I settled on cupcakes as other items seemed very overpriced...  I was disappointed though in the coldness of the service I received... the individuals working weren't \"rude\" per se, but they certainly were not friendly by any means... and if I'm going to pay $7 for a tiny opera cake, I expect at least a smile.  Having read the other reviews, it sounds like it is possible to receive great service here... however, it needs to be consistent in order for this place to be worth the money they are charging for their desserts...  Regardless, the cupcakes were great so I'd possibly give this place one more try since it is so convenient to my office... but I do not see myself going out of my way to visit..."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and has Delicious ice cream as macaroons. I strongly recommend either the hazelnut chocolate or the strawberry shortcake gelato. I like to top my ice cream with the cookie dough macaron which looks just like Cookie Monster - very adorable! It is open until 10 on weekdays and has a cool vibe to it so it's a great spot to hang out post dinner or happy hour! I haven't tried their other desserts but I'm sure they're just as yummy! I recommended this place to my cousin this past weekend when he was in town with a group of volunteers. He said the place was a hit - high recommend!"}
{"text":"I walk by this place all the time and I finally stopped to get something. I got the Red Velvet cupcakes. They were good but not the freshest. I would go here again but that was my experience. The guy that served me really knew his stuff too about what's in each desert. He could really sell you on anything in there. I'll update this review once I visit them again."}
{"text":"On the eve of Valentine's Day you should not pass this place up. I try to be stingy with my 5 stars so they're meaningful. Every time I'm been here since they've been open I am simply delighted. First there is a their selection for all the moods of my palette. Sometimes I want something sweet but not as heavy as chocolate, they have key lime pie. Maybe you'd rather have a macaron or three. Of course there any variety of chocolate confections: cupcakes, cake, mousses or signature chocolates all perfect to share after a dinner out on the town or after a stroll thru uptown. When I have company my favorite thing is to dip in & get two hot chocolates.  The food is what brings me there but it's the atmosphere & the prices that keep me coming back. For being inside the Ritz Carlton I feel that I have spent less money here than at Amelie's. Once you have your desserts in hand, if you came looking for quiet conversation, I'll give you a hint later. There are certainly the little tables but if it's a blustry evening avoid them as people can't seem to work the revolving door that is to keep the wind from blowing onto you. You could take your desserts down to the hotel bar if you want liveliness or are pairing your treat with a cabernet or port.   Hot Chocolates in hand take the stairs down to the bar, go thru the bar and hang a right. The loveseats along the wall by the elevator are the place to get to know someone."}
{"text":"Oh how I love this little sweet shop, they have chocolate, they have cookies, they have gelato, they have cupcakes, they have all my favorites and oh yeah coffee too.  My absolute fav are the cookies, which are baked in house and vary daily and yes they are addictive.  The gelato sometimes seem to have freezer burn so I usually don't order that.  Occasionally I get a cupcake but pass me the white chocolate macadamia cookies because they are amazing and my fav and usually available on Fridays."}
{"text":"The Gelato's are perfect. Blood Orange and the Honey Pecan are my favorites.  The Macaroons and Candies are a sure bet.  Every Time we are in Charlotte we go here first."}
{"text":"My wife had a little sample of several things- all were tasty. I especially recommend the honey and walnut gelato and the carrot cake cupcake. Yum. The Nutella macaroon didn't really resonate. Maybe skip it, which is surprising because it's Nutella and macaroon."}
{"text":"Fancy.   For a small, sweet bite while in Uptown, this is a convenient stop. The desserts are picture perfect and delightful to your tastebuds!  The downfall is where to take your dessert to enjoy...the Ritz is always a popular place to be. Unless you already have a spot due to the bar draw, then be prepared to sit on laps or to take it out the door. (I drove past recently and noticed since my first visit they have added a few table and chairs outside.)"}
{"text":"Only spent one evening in Charlotte, but this was my favorite place. Had some \"hummingbird\" ice cream which was a tasty amalgamation of flavors. The best part was the jazz music being played behind a thin vale on the other side. Good date place if I lived here."}
{"text":"Bar Cocoa is part of the Ritz Carlton in Uptown Charlotte, so I expected it to be pretty and to have great chocolate. It does. I tried the chocolate raspberry mousse and it was AMAZING! I will be going back just for this.  It is a small space, so you may have to sit in the Ritz to enjoy your treat, but otherwise it is worth a visit from any chocolate lover."}
{"text":"Purchased a dulce gelato, carmel banana tart & a chocolate vanilla mousse.  I'm a fan of a Ritz and belong to the rewards program.    I was not that impressed.  The chocolate vanilla mousse seemed chocolatey & not sure where the vanilla was.  It was ok but it was not light & fluffy or a thick & creamy concoction as you might expect mousse to be.  It was chocolatey.  The Carmel Banana tart I was really excited as a carmel person vs. a chocolate person.  I could not find the carmel or the banana.  In both cases, the salesperson indicated the 0.5 mile I needed to walk back to the office before eating it would be ok unrefrigerated & it was a cooler day for CLT.  So I don't know if the temperature had anything to do w/it.  Dulce gelato was very tasty & I would return for it."}
{"text":"If you can walk by Bar Cocoa and not have a silent pull towards it's decadent crafts, we can't be friends. We just can't.    For a place you'd think is overpriced because it's in the daunting Ritz-Carlton, it's actually way cheaper than other places that sell similar sweets (namely, Amelies) in the area. 2$ macarons, 2.50$ cupcakes, 6$ beers, and a chill seating area with a fancy vibe,  it literally can't get any better. The night we went, they had a jazz band playing. In the middle of our sitting, however, they started to put out little signs saying that tables were reserved for those spending 20$+.  I don't know how often that happens. Maybe just on Saturdays, maybe just on live jazz show days?   Whatever the pattern, I hope I'll go enough to figure it out!"}
{"text":"Excellent gelato and a great price! Great location downtown -- perfect to grab dessert after dinner and sit in their outdoor seating. They also had chocolates and coffee that looked fun too! Would recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Gelato...delicious. Honey sourced from their own hives on the roof. Not cheap, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"This place is great for a small late night snack without going overboard. I always enjoy the different selections of truffles available and usually get one to appease my sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"Who knew heaven was on the corner of East Trade Street! Wonderful selection of desserts - from varying flavors of truffles to macaroons to a \"just right\" selection of gelatos, to cup cupcakes and other sinfully delicious pastries - this place has become my favorite!  It's attached to The Ritz Carlton and feels sophisticated with the marvel floors, friendly staff, and overall presentation! I don't think I'll ever be able to visit Charlotte again without making a stop!"}
{"text":"The Place is BEAUTIFUL!   Small!  Really just Four seats!!!  Seems to almost serve as a lobby of sorts to the Hotel and Restaurant!  Service!  OUTSTANDING!  When I told the Dude working here (he asked how we liked our Desserts) I told him and he made some suggestions and brought over two that he thought we would like!  The Girl working here was very helpful getting the Most Photogenic of each item we chose (I told her I would photograph these and she had some good ideas)!  What was really Good or Better than good :   All of These Desserts are BEAUTIFUL!!!  Macaroons were exceptional!  Better than \"Amelie's\" More comparable to \"Think Chocolate\" in Ballantyne!  Red Velvet, Orange Sickle and Pistachio were the best of the five we tasted!  Cream Cheese Icing on Top of a Carrot Cake Cupcake!  My Bride and I enjoyed this Icing which is VERY Rare since I prefer a Butter Cream Icing and only a Rare Cream Cheese Icing... Usually only one of us likes the same... I this particular situation we BOTH thought it was EXCEPTIONAL! ! !  The Cake had a very Fine Flavor, Like a Sweet Carrot Bread, much less sweet than Cake which was Nice for us since we already had so much Dessert!  Peanut-butter and Jelly Creation, this was the Yellow most Unusual and Unique Looking of what they had!     What needs work :  The Dessert Named after the place \"Bar Cocoa\" was very poor, as if someone took fine ingredients and some how made them look Marvelous and taste CHEAP!  This was so poor we only took a few (small) bites and left the rest! 1 yelp star  Same story with the Very Beautiful Tart (Chocolate and Banana) tasted very Artificial and CHEAP! less than one yelp star  Gelato had very little flavor 2 yelp stars at the most!  We were here last Saturday Night 4-27 for my the Dessert Part of a Birthday Celebration for my Bride!  We did not taste any of the Chocolates and would go back to see what they were like IF we lived here!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a few macaron's and were pleasantly surprised by the service and selection. The price was very average and the handful of flavors i bought were mostly A-ok. Nothing stand-out about Bar Cocoa and their foods, but nothing negative either.   Wouldn't recommend the nutella flavor - all I could taste was milk chocolate, so I was really disappointed with that.   Would totally recommend the coffee flavor!"}
{"text":"Get to the Chase:  Pros: 1) Very clean, and well-presented 2) Nice variety of sweets  Cons: 1) Some of the macaroons were fresh (soft, and with slight bite) , while others were stale (really chewy and hard like a hockey puck) 2) Limited to 2 flavors of gelato/sorbet...not even negotiable to have a 3rd flavor haha 3) The watermelon and mango sorbets tasted pretty decent, but after the 5th taste...they started tasting like some Fructis shampoo/shower gel   Wanted to love it, but left disappointed"}
{"text":"Yummy treats, speciality drinks, Ritz Carlton customer service and LIVE jazz!!! Great chill place to relax! Great date night!"}
{"text":"Closest I'll get to having any business in the ritz Carlton.   $2.50 a truffle. Worth $5 $8 chocolate mousse cake. Airy. Creamy. Beautiful. Damn good.   Nice little place to hang out outside and be fancy and watch ppl. Perfect ending to lunch at Merts a few doors down."}
{"text":"Cute but not what I expected...it's a small bakery connected to a restaurant with indoor/outdoor seating. Not over the top as I thought it would be...There is a small array of desserts to choose from such as gelato, macaroons, cookies, cupcakes, and a torte or two. I got a dark chocolate cupcake which was really light and good."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot for a quick stop in downtown.  I've had the croissants and espresso so really can only speak to those items. Their croissants are delicious and amazingly fresh.  They serve Nespresso style espresso drinks which means it most likely comes out of the little pods... if you're looking for a Great espresso stop I probably wouldn't recommend here since it's going to be an automated process.  I am impressed at what the nespresso machines can do but I still prefer the traditional method and fresh espresso other coffee shops have to offer.  In summary, I would be coming here for the bakery items, the macaroons, and the gelato with coffee being an after thought. Will return for those items."}
{"text":"Bar Cocoa is a great place to stop for coffee or dessert after a night on the town! Whenever I have guests in Charlotte I always make sure to include this chic little spot on our itinerary.  Bar Cocoa offers dark, milk, or white hot chocolate which, in my opinion, is revolutionary! My man ordered white and I ordered milk and they were both totally divine. The place is connected to a lounge that was playing awesome jazz music which really added to the ambience.   Bar Cocoa has the most beautiful, creatively-flavored, air-brushed truffles that were incredibly sumptuous. Enjoying decadent chocolate with your partner, watching glamorous people walk the Charlotte streets, listening to the sexy sounds of jazz floating your way...I cannot think of a more romantic place than Bar Cocoa!"}
{"text":"GREAT HONEY PECAN GELATO TOPPED WITH COFFEE MACARON.    So worth it!!!!  The pricing isn't too bad either, about $2.75 for a small gelato, and I don't normally like sweets so this was more than enough for me, not to say I didn't devour every drop of it.  The decor is beautiful, a trendy and hip place to have a drink and munch on a little bit of sweetness."}
{"text":"The chocolate there is high chocolatier art. Beautiful and tasty. Stop and in treat yourself to a truffle or two!  It would be a sexy place to take a girl on a date after dinner. Feed each other a truffle:)"}
{"text":"Signature bar cocoa cake was amazing, tasted like a huge ferrera rocher. (5 stars from me) I'd absolutely get it again. My dad loved it also and loved his hazelnut chocolate gelato. My daughter had vanilla and ate it all. I'd recommend and go back for sure."}
{"text":"Insanely good cupcakes!! Very moist and the frosting isn't too sweet to actually finish! I usually don't like frosting but it's definitely always on point. I also generally like to bake myself but these cupcakes are easy for a quick grab if you're running late to a birthday party or out on the town with the girls. The service is great too. Just make sure to ask for exactly what you want/need and they'll help as much as possible!"}
{"text":"Delicious gelato at a surprisingly reasonable price! The raspberry is my favorite, but I also enjoy the chocolate hazelnut and honey pecan. The staff is always pleasant and hospitable. I have not ventured much outside the gelato. The truffles and assorted chocolates in the display cases look too good to eat.   I find myself walking over many nights to grab a cup of gelato and take a walk."}
{"text":"Very good gelato and good cupcakes.  The hours are quite strange though.  I tried to come on a Sunday and found out that it closes at noon...very strange for a hotel.  Overall, great value for the money."}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love this place! I had a scoop of gelato on top of the pecan pie. It... was... glorious! The service was great for a place that doesn't have servers. The cashier was super helpful in showing my Mom around (yes I took my Mom here) and providing advice."}
{"text":"Hazelnut gelato was very good- I have had a lot from NYC NJ and even Italy ! I was impressed as my expectations were not high.   I also ordered cookie dough macaroons which were also surprisingly good! I was very impressed again because my experience with a different restaurant in Charlotte with macaroons was sub par.   Reasonably priced as well!"}
{"text":"I went to Bar Cocoa last night with my family ( there were 5 of us including my 10yr old daughter). We were excited because we are a sweet crazed family! I was looking forward to some gelato even though it was a bit cold outside but sadly, out of the 5 flavors offered, none were to my liking. My favorite flavors are anything with chocolate or caramel but neither were offered.   My family immediately gravitated toward the cake display so I joined them. Two people purchased chocolate cupcakes, one a red velvet cupcake, another the pumpkin cheesecake and I got the coconut cake. The service at Bar Cocoa was great! The gentleman was friendly, smiling and very pleasant. At the bar they only offered coffee and hot chocolate. We were encouraged to grab a seat at the Ritz Carlton lounge area where we would be offered a wider selection of drinks.  Our desserts were all just average tasting. No one, including myself, was wowed by anything. I usually love most coconut flavored anything but this cake was filled with big chunks of coconut flakes. I couldn't detect any actual cake in there at all. It was unpleasantly chewy. I don't recommend it.  The lounge in the Ritz was dimly lit with a beautiful stone fireplace toward the back where there is a second bar serving cocktails. The lounge area was fairly empty. There was one table occupied with a couple. My family and I sat down and were noticed by the female server as we walked in but she didn't approach our table. I found that odd but I waited. About 5 minutes later she went to the table with the couple and asked them if they wanted more drinks. She took their order, left, and promptly returned with their drinks. Then she left again without coming over to us. Another 5 minutes goes by and a second couple enters the lounge area with their desserts from Bar Cocoa. As as they're seated she approaches their table and asks if they want anything. Then she leaves again without even looking our way. At that point we were almost done and didn't want to stay any longer with such rude and dismissive service.   I am not sure why she chose to ignore our table but I was extremely disappointed. I expected better from such an establishment. With mediocre desserts and horrible service I definitely won't be going back or bringing anymore guests with me when looking for a place to satisfy our sweet tooth. I give the two stars for the gentleman that served us our desserts."}
{"text":"My husband and I just visited with our 6 year old on a whim. We had a great experience. The tiramisu gelato is amazing as was the lemon strawberry compote! Although I didn't have any, the macaroons looked amazing. It was hard to choose!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to get desserts in Charlotte. I wish they had a larger assortment to choose from, but it is a small boutique dessert shop. My favorite is the vanilla cupcake!"}
{"text":"Bar Cocoa is brilliant idea!  Beautiful little confections available for small fee - both money wise and calorie wise.  It has all the hallmarks to be an exciting addition to the Uptown snack area.  The deserts are fabulous - expertly made.  The staff is friendly.  The location is spot on (inside the Ritz, across from the Epicenter and many of the office towers Uptown).  Why two stars then?  All of the well done bits go to waste if there is no one to serve you the delights!  I work Uptown and like many folks get a hankering for something sweet in the late afternoon, this would be a go-to place.  But the last several times I walked over, there was no one around to serve me or take my money!    Understand the value of someone buying a couple caramels or truffles is not nearly as high as a room at the Ritz or even a glass of wine at the bar... but it's disappointing customer experience to see all these beautiful treats behind glass and the no way to get to them.  Unfortunately, they lost me (and anyone I drag along for a treat) as a customer because of this pretty significant gap."}
{"text":"Terrible service... We tried to have a nice gathering and it took the lady over 25 minutes to make an espresso!! You would expect a lot more from the Ritz! So bummed"}
{"text":"Very cute and cozy little coffee shop/bakery. They even have gelato. Prices are very reasonable and the two gentlemen working were very nice. Though we did not get any desserts they all looked amazing.   We were in the area in a cold day and googled the best hot chocolate near us and this place came up. My husband and brother both got the hot chocolate but I got a small cappuccino instead. The hot chocolate (because of course I still had to try it) had a very smooth and creamy texture. They loved it! It also had like a cinnamon flavor in it. It wasn't your basic hot chocolate, it was definitely elevated. The cappuccino was pretty standard.   Once ordered there's a little hall that takes you down to a seating area. There a restaurant there but also some couches in front of a fireplace. It was super nice!"}
{"text":"Was looking for something sweet and this was perfect! They have a large selection of macaroons and gelato and other delicious items like cake and cupcakes.  Had the red velvet cupcake and it was soft, moist and the cream cheese frosting was just perfect - not overly sweet. My boyfriend had the carrot cake cupcake and it was moist and perfectly balanced. They have outdoor seating so it was nice to sit outside and people watch."}
{"text":"Staying at the ritz- at at the epicenter and came back for dessert.  This place was good.  Got the peanut butter truffles, chocolate cupcake and tiramisu.  All delicious and fresh.  Id like to come back here in the summer and eat on the patio."}
{"text":"Nice place stumbled upon it.  The attraction was the deserts I saw in the window.  Went inside and bought the macaroons...they are so delicious.. My first time having them and I am hooked.   Macaroons are pretty expensive but was worth the money.  I recommend the pistachio and red velvet flavor macaroons."}
{"text":"Bottom line (at the top): We got to pick a dessert from Bar Cocoa as a part of our pre-fixe from brunch at the Ritz. Everything looks beautiful but looks are quite deceiving in this case. :/  --  Came here on Saturday morning after the family had some bizness in Charlotte. We did the three course prefixe and the third course was to pick dessert from Bar Cocoa. I'm not quite sure how the brunch was so good and Bar Cocoa was so bad.. We had the tiramisu (meh), chocolate raspberry cake (double meh, the raspberry jam inside was soo bitter), chocolate hazelnut praline cake (the best relatively, but still not that great, red velvet cupcake (horrendous, really dry), etc. etc.   As a dessert fanatic this really broke my heart."}
{"text":"Bar Cocoa is heaven on earth I tell you! It is situated on a small corner inside the Ritz Carlton on the ground floor. It is a dangerous place for me because I walk through these doors every night I am in town. I end up getting a dessert on my way up to my room way too many times.  It's a good thing I am only in Charlotte for a week. I have tried their signature dessert, the Bar Cocoa, and it was delectible!!! I loved the little crunch at the bottom and the smooth, rich, creamy mousse in the middle with a little glaze of raspberry on top. I have also had their key lime bar and it is sooooo good with a cup of espresso. It is not too tangy and has like a shortbread kind of shell. I love key lime but some are too tart for me. This was perfect! I want to try one of their cupcakes next. The chocolate, red velvet and carrot cake looks too good and moist! At $2.50 each cupcake I might have to give in and take all three. Splurge a little!"}
{"text":"I've been here more then 10 times and the taste of the cupcakes have declined . The cupcakes used to be great. I got a vanilla cupcake today at 5:00pm and it was stale tasting and hard like it was sitting out since the morning. Service wasn't great either had to wait a few minutes until someone came up."}
{"text":"After you've had your dinner at BLT - and perhaps a drink at the bar - make sure you save time for a snack at Bar Cocoa. It is very easy to miss, since it's tucked into the corner entrance, and you can easily sneak by without even realizing that they are there.  On one side you have the truffles and drinks, on the other, an excellent display of macarons and other sweets, and though small, it's a great way to grab a small bite to take with you as you wander elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here after dinner time. They weren't busy at all but it seemed like it took forever to be served. I got a medium size cup of the gelato. It was good and creamy. I probably would of been better off getting the smaller cup since it was so rich. I heard a lot about their milkshakes and when I asked about them, I was told it was only a seasonal item.   Inside had very little chairs and tables. We had to eat outside which I didn't mind since the seats seemed more comfortable and you get a good view of uptown."}
{"text":"You want the cake?  You can't handle the cake!  I have had the multi-layer chocolate cake and the multi-layer red velvet cake during their Slice of the South cake series and I would not hesitate to call them both the best desserts in Charlotte.  The slice of chocolate cake was so large, the edges were literally hanging off the sides of the plate.  These are insanely rich, moist cakes with very thick frosting on top and between the layers.  There are cases filled with macaroons, cupcakes and other confections and everything looks beautifully well done.  The atmosphere is very nice with a lot of comfortable seating and low lighting.  An excellent place to go on a date."}
{"text":"A little disappointing. The desserts were good but very high price. I have had and seen some similar desserts at publix for much cheaper and same quality. It was a little difficult to get to but the atmosphere was cool. Just not what I was expecting after seeing all the pictures and previous reviews. I would've recommended something else for tourists."}
{"text":"This place is inside of the Ritz Carlton right next to their restaurant. We were staying at the Marriott next door and wanted something sweet after dinner. There are so many different things you can have. From cupcakes to cannolis, to bon bons and tarts.  After bombarding the guy behind the counter with about 54 questions (kudos to his patience with me) I decided on their signature dessert, Bar cocoa. When the guy described it as a gourmet kit kat, I was in! I LOVE kit kat.  It was 7:00, but it was a very good size and it was clearly a gourmet and labor intensive dessert. OMG AMAZING! I was so happy with my choice! It was so decadent with a great crunch from the praline. OH and it was hazelnut chocolate, my favorite! A friend of mine got the chocolate cupcake which was amazing as well. The cake was very moist and chocolatey while the icing was perfect!  I'll be back when I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Cool little place to stop in a have a coffee drink, sweet treat, or gelato.  The menu said it right \"offers a cozy dining nook or sidewalk terrace to enjoy its house-made pastries...\".  Very accurate description.  There is a nice view of uptown from the patio and comfortable seating to people watch.   I was hoping for a milkshake that day, but they only offer them certain times of the year.  I had a cup of gelato which was tasty...creamy and flavorful.  The staff was friendly.  Everything in the case was beautiful and looked so delicious and delightful!!"}
{"text":"A disappointment for sure. I came in with my daughters expecting to be able to find some sweet treats & hot cocoa for them & an adult beverage for me after seeing The Nutcracker ballet across the street. There was an incredible line, they were out of hot chocolate and many of their dessert offerings. To enjoy your treats you have to just sit in the hotel lobby.  Maybe I should have done more research but I expected to find something a little higher end and certainly more well-run since its associated with Ritz Carlton."}
{"text":"On a Thursday night, we ordered a red velvet cupcake (2.50) and 2 macarons (1.50) for 8  - Got the smoore and mint chocolate macaron. A bit to crispy. Breaks into pieces upon first bite. I like mine more soft and chewy. - Smoore had marshmallow - Red Velvet was not moist, a bit dry and hard.  - Maybe because we came at a time when they were about to close, the texture was not at its best.  - Although they did have live music and a nice fireplace. Good place to sit and relax.  - Go to CVS and get the milk at the EPICenter :)"}
{"text":"Delicious little sweets shop! My sis and I stopped here after a long day of Pokemon catching. It was late in the evening so we were happy to find something open. There's a lot of dim lighting so it may look closed but check the hours. The place is classy, clean, and modern. The woman helping was friendly and informative about some allergies we had to worry about when making our selection. We chose a cupcake and chocolates and the total was under $10. The BEST part about this place is its connection to the hotel next door. If you're lucky there will be a jazz band playing in the adjoining lounge with a cool metal bead curtain and beautiful seating. A wonderful place to relax with a treat."}
{"text":"I have never eaten here for breakfast or lunch but I go regularly for dessert.  The cookies and Gelato are great and the Gelato is reasonably priced.   Also the people watching can be fun on weekend nights."}
{"text":"The cupcake was kind of dry and just wasn't good. However the chocolate truffles were excellent"}
{"text":"I am rating Bar Cocoa's bakery section with 4 stars.  The varied selections were displayed elegantly and were pleasing to observe!  Service was smooth and pleasant.  I first enjoyed a piece of candy (upwards of 2.50) - salted caramel dark chocolate.  It was the perfect portion and was scrumptious.  Later (in the wee hours of the morning), I enjoyed eating the chocolate cupcake that definitely hit the spot.  However, Bar Cocoa get 4 stars because I wanted to enjoy a glass of wine with my chocolate cupcake but was unable to find a seat in the bar areas to the left of the baked goods.  The time was around 10:00PM.  This isn't a problem for a business but it was a problem for me."}
{"text":"The service was good , the location good ,the customer service was great. up scale place but not expensive . I think this would be a good place to take someone on a second date."}
{"text":"We stopped by last night for some after dinner gelato, we've actually never been here and I never realized it was so close. They had a few options, about 6, of gelato. The hazelnut and caramel tasted so good we had to get them both. We put the two flavors in a small for $3.50 ( should have gone with the large for $5). The caramel was delicious, like melt in your mouth creme brûlée. The hazelnut was good too, a little dark cocoa-ish for my taste.   They had a large selection of macarons. Cakes, and chocolates. Will be back for a longer sit down experience. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Decided to head uptown for a bit of dessert and landed at Bar Cocoa. We had initially only intended to stop for Gelato but were instantly attracted to all the gorgeous truffles and confections and ended up totally gorging ourselves on sweets.  Tried the Pistachio Gelato, the texture was heavenly and accompanied by a crisp crunch of fresh nuts. We also sampled a variety of truffles (Lemon Bar, Tahitian Caramel, German Chocolate Cake, and Caramel Macchiatio). Each was artistically crafted and resembled a brightly colored gem. We also shared a slice of Coconut Cake. Everything had it's own unique and enticing flavor and I am not embarrassed to say we ate it all!   The barista was patient and helpful and made sure we fully enjoyed each of our selections. Absolutely decadent!"}
{"text":"First visit and I absolutely loved this place.  I had a Ristretto which is now my new favorite coffee. Smooth, velvety and creamy all on its own with 0 bitterness. Simply delicious! I took two cupcakes and 2 macaroons to go. I split the cupcakes with my husband and although the red velvet was solid, I was blown away by the orange cream cupcake. Oh my word!  I'm not an orange flavor lover but that cupcake was out of this world. It was the featured cupcake of the day. The cake part was moist and very mild in flavor. It was filled with sweet cream cheese and topped with the awesomest souped-up orange scented cream cheese frosting. I can't begin to explain how much I enjoyed this cupcake. Wow! The 2 macaroons were enjoyed by my 8 year old. She said they were awesome. Nuff said!   Ugh!  I need to come back here SOON!"}
{"text":"The chocolate is to die for . . . but skip the $8 coffee. It's just Pete's for Pete's sake. During the afternoon the staff are stretched thin between the confection area and the bar. Went there with hubby I think it was a Friday or Saturday night and was pleasantly surprsied with the live soul singer . . . place was packed! This is the Ritz however, so you will pay for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Chocolates were decent.  (not made in house).  Really liked the caramel eclair! But the macaroons we took home were so-so.  A couple of them were good, but others tasted a bit stale and dry.  Loved that they had a nice variety of flavors, but we couldn't even tell what flavors they were supposed to be by the time we got them home.  So much potential here!"}
