{"text":"I ordered the 1/4 chicken meal(2 sides), and it was very authentic and tasty. They ask weather you want mild or hot dressing on you chicken. I went with the mild, and would highly recommend it! The quality of the ingredients is evident and it is in a great location"}
{"text":"The best portuguese custard tarts you will ever find. Good prices. At times difficult to find parking. Sometimes so busy that you might have a bit of a wait to get your order."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure coming here.
Theyve even hired a few summer students
They jave plenry of options I love the sandwiches but I am not allowed to hve coldcuts while pregnant. 
So i just hot some snacks.
My fav was the shrimp turnovers i believe theyre called. Actual chuncks of shrimos w some sort of creamy filling so goood.
I also got some cod croquettes, also great. They are room temperature when you buy them and super delicious. Id love to taste them hot out the oven.
I also got custard tarts , i believe they cost 1.40 each but a pack of 6 is only 3.99$ super cheap. So i went w the package instead.
Will definitely be back whenever in brampton. 
The girls ay the front are super friendly and they have alot of senior customers who are real cheeky and funny. Super fun enviroment, they also have a mini patio out back if you wanna soak in some sun."}
{"text":"I am a downtown local & I always walk passed this business...today I was brave enough to walk through their doors. Bakery heaven...please do not come here if you are on a diet lol! Cakes & baked goods enclosed by the servers. Two pleasent & well presented women were running the show. One of these ladies served me & we had a nice conversation. Nice morning ambiance & I would sit in if I had time. Would come here again :-)"}
