{"text":"A neighborhood gem tucked away in a quiet street off the main Danforth strip. My goto comfort food is the rice bowl - pay the extra bucks and get it fully loaded."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this cafe. Yummy, healthy, vegan options that are all delicious. Reasonably priced too! Even the smoothies. And super sweet and accommodating staff. I'd go here every day if I could."}
{"text":"Another hidden gem in the Danforth/Woodbine area. 4.5 stars out of 5.

I stumbled upon this coffee house when I was in the area. It was exactly what I was looking for at that moment. They gladly made my latte with almond milk (bonus points). Also on the menu (but will have to try next time): fresh fruit or veggie juices, and organic rice bowls. Loved the atmosphere; sparse but cozy decor with great music playing in the background. Free wifi. Absolutely fab."}
{"text":"We go here sometimes when we are getting our car cleaned at splash and shine. They have the best healthy food and they are so sweet! We got the curry chickpea stew with brown rice as a bed. Amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome neighbourhood joint! Coffee is amazing, food is healthy and delicious. Staff are kind, what more could you want?"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop in the Woodbine/Danforth area.  Had an Americano that was very delightful.  There is a wide range of books that are on display.  Looks like a nice place sit back enjoy your beverage and book.  Yes, also cool record player playing some good tunes.

I would like to revisit and try some of there food option.  Have heard many good things!

For those of you who have little ones.  You can enjoy your beverage as the kids enjoy a nice ice cream next door."}
{"text":"Based on reviews, this place has great food items (rice bowls, etc.), but I can't comment since I haven't tried them.

With \"Coffee House\" in the name of this comfy, neighbourhood cafe, I thought they might take their coffee and espresso-based drinks seriously. They start off well, getting their beans from Merchants of Green Coffee (http://www.yelp.com/biz/merchants-of-green-coffee-toronto), but they don't know what to do with it.

I've had cappuccinos made by two different people now, including the owner I think, and neither have the skills. For one thing, the milk was over-steamed and frothed, resulting in a too-hot drink, and dry fluffy foam. Nothing that couldn't be improved with some concentration on training and technique, but it's obviously not a priority.

Enjoy the food, but don't expect a lot from the coffee."}
{"text":"While waiting for my car to get detailed at Splash & Shine, I stopped into Circus Coffee House. It's a cute little coffee house that offers a small selection of vegan food. 

When I arrived I was absolutely starving and opted for the rice bowl with Baba Ganoush and Tofu. It tasted amazing! I'd highly recommend this. I was still hungry so I had some black bean soup as well... it was okay. I also had a Vanilla Almond Milk Latte that was delicious.

Overall everything was really good, and I'd definitely come back if I were in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"For what it is, it is very good. It is an extremely tiny coffee shop that pulls a nice espresso and serves simple food
Service is extremely friendly, and you will never have a lack of friendly locals chatting you up
There is one center table that comfortably fits for people and some bar seat stools by the window.
They do have wifi Internet, but unless you plan on getting cozy with the Barista - forget doing your work here
Stopping for coffee, chat with the locals and then continue your day.
PS: they have a record player and they certainly do use it!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place looking for a cute cafe to relax on a weekend. I only expected it to have a few coffees and smoothies, but the girl that worked there told us about their rice bowls and we decided to try them. Best decision ever made! You can choose between several toppings (I always go for the baba ganoush and tofu) and the raw carrots and beets add such a delicious sweetness to it. The stew and soup are also amazing, and they change every day so it's always a surprise. Personally, I love their mocha the best, but the Americano is very good too. This is a really cozy place with great music and wonderful staff, so if you're in the area, be sure to stop by!"}
{"text":"The rice bowls OMG!  Highly recommended.  Also, Americano is very good.  I haven't tried their juices but I will soon.  

The shop has a lot of books for sale, plenty of indie newspapers, mags and even some toys!  

The only thing I would suggest is a few separate tables for seating instead of a big one.  There are window seats with bar stools but sometimes it's too sunny and I feel awkward sitting with a couple/working person etc to eat some lunch.  :P

Edit * love the juices! Also got used to the communal table"}
{"text":"I got a coffee from here last summer, a younger guy served me and the coffee was so bad I threw it out, I went once before and the coffee was still not that great so I haven't gone back"}
{"text":"cute place on a side street - really only serving the locals around the Woodbine/Danforth area.

bf ordered a coffee here that he thought was pretty good. they seem to have smoothies and fresh juices as well. and nifty rice bowls. 

will be back to try out the juices and food.

seems to be a quiet place to chill for a couple of hours."}
{"text":"Solid coffee at this neighbourhood shop that's tucked away on the side street. The staff is friendly and their brand are fresh. The espresso shots are pulled just right so that it is not sour."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe that serves amazing and affordable vegan rice bowls! I was full from a medium bowl that included 2 toppings (guacamole and tofu), and best part was that it was only $5. Definitely good value for a lunch meal. I also got a latte which seemed to be a popular item. 

I studied here for several hours and noticed that it was mostly locals dropping by. The staff are really friendly and welcoming. No doubt I'd come back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"A cool coffee place around the corner, nice to chill. Unpretentious place. Super healthy food... Rice bowls looks good! Hands down on the Americano, whatever blend of coffee they're using. Although the roasted red pepper soup was abit watered down... Not having much of a taste. Next time round, there juices and smoothies is a must try!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today and was served by a young man who was clearly passionate about serving only the very best food. The stew I had was fantastic, as was the fresh juice. Really nice atmosphere too."}
