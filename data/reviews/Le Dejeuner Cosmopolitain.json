{"text":"Tried this place today with some friends to enjoy a brunch.

First the line was very big and the waitress kept asking us to close the doors but she didn't take a minute to realize that it was not possible with the amount of people waiting in the lobby.

Second the seating logistic is horrible they put 2 people in a booth that can sit 4/6 people. By doing that so many people are waiting for a seat.

Third the menu is huge and by going through it all I actually forgot half of it. They should reduce by half and people wouldn't even notice. The food was ok but not amazing. The asparagus and feta omelette I had was good but a bit bland. The special mash breakfast potato are ok but those were very salty.

Finally when it came to the service was good but not great. It was crazy busy but we should still be able to get great service. We asked for 3 glasses of water and only got 2. Also we waited over 30 minutes to get the orange juice shot and we even asked the waitress twice.

Like I said it was an ok place to eat but not great"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast.  Nice service, clean and good food.  I had the apple cheddar and bacon omelette.  It was cooked perfect.  Nice treat."}
{"text":"Tentative de brunch du dimanche. Le lieu était bien rempli, le menu très long a étudier.
Cela nous a pris un bon moment a lire le long menu et nous avons choisi une crêpe oeuf, fromage et jambon et un club sandwich au poulet 'le meilleur du monde' selon le menu.
Les portions et les assiettes étaient vraiment grandes mais j'ai été un peu déçue par les mets. La crêpe était très épaisse, les toasts un peu trop cuits.
Notre serveuse était cependant très sympa donc l'expérience reste ok.
Pas sure que ce serait mon choix pour un brunch futur."}
{"text":"It had been awhile since I've been there.  A friend of mine from south shore stopped by on an early Saturday morning and I told him I would introduce him to the best breakfast potatoes in the large Montreal area.  He wasn't disappointed and me neither! They are just phenomenal!!

The place is bigger than it was before the fire a couple of years ago, but the interior decor is pretty much the same.

Best breakfast in town!"}
{"text":"J'aime bien aller aux restos de brunch même pour un lunch. J'en ai essayé plusieurs, celui-ci se situe au milieu de la fourchette: certainement pas le plus créatif ou unique, mais les portions sont bonnes et j'aime bien leur carte. L'ambiance est un peu vieillotte, le décor des assiettes typique... Le service est aimable."}
{"text":"Not going to beat around the bush with this one.. ..
The decor is country/breakfast style.. the restaurant itself its kinda big.
We waited quite a long time before getting a seat.. Then when we finally ordered, our waiter brought the wrong beverages and we waited quite a while for our food.
I ordered the 'Montreal Star'  which is just your basic, Bagel with Cream Cheese,Smoked Salmon,Red Onions & Capers.. It wasn't bad.. The potatoes that come with the breakfast plates were pretty tasty. The Eggs Benedict were quite bland, but the Banana Pancakes are quite yummy! :)
Price range is pretty much your typical breakfast place.. 5-15$ I guess?
So, all in all, if you live in the area, try it out.. but I wouldn't go out of my way"}
{"text":"It was such a great experience! I ordered a table d'hôte for lunch. It was a grilled cheese avocado bacon and pesto sandwich. Came with french fries and shrimp salad on the side. The fries were perfect, a bit soft and sweet, perfectly cooked. It came with a choice of soup or tomato juice, and dessert at the end, which was rice pudding or fruit salad. Very affordable, all that food was only 12.99$ ! The restaurant was nice, and the bathrooms too. Good service as well. I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Endroit très populaire. Un peu vieillot. Pour ma part je n'y trouve rien de très spécial. Ils y servent des déjeuners traditionnels."}
{"text":"THis isn't one of my favorite places but it's much better than some other places I've been too. I really enjoy the potatoes. They are very tasty. But the eggs benedict are something to avoid. It comes in a bowl and the hollandaise sauce is bland and super watery. I tried it at 2 different occaisions and it wasn't any better. But if you're just going for bacons and eggs, it's fine. Nothing over the top."}
{"text":"We went here for Father's Day with a reservation for 7 people, we didn't have to wait long which was a plus. We all had a variety of plates from waffles to crepes to eggs Benedict. There menu has a vast variety but in my opinion the actual size of the menu is way to big. 

Our waitress was nice but she seemed over whelmed, forgot some of our items but it was understandable since the place was packed. I have been coming here for years and will continue I love it here"}
{"text":"Cosmopolitan was well known to deliver solid breakfasts that really hit the spot. I used to be a junkie of this place before new places like Allo Mon Coco & Petinos opened up in Laval and I can safely state that while this breakfast joint is still a solid place to have a breakfast, I much prefer the potatoes, toast options and service much better elsewhere.

This place usually has the worst of seating arrangements, where patrons of 2 regularly take up up booths that can seat 4 or more while there is a line-up that goes outside its doors. Cosmo, you need to tell patrons that you simply can't accommodate them! Sure some will be unhappy with this decision but when the day will come when they come here in a group of 4, they won't have to wait extra long because couple take up massive booth for no real sound logistical reason during rush time.

I like that certain meals get a free shot of orange juice. On this last visit, I certainly felt mine was pretty much watered down. I got 1 coffee refill early on in my visit before my coffee was even halfway but was left high and dry for the rest of my time here. If I'm planning to pay, that is not the time to ask me for a refill!!!

The eggs were OK, the sausages were overcooked & small, the bacon was good, and the crepes were really good. Overall, a solid meal, minus a few points for weak service. In the egg I much prefer Eggquis next door that leave a huge thermal mug of coffee for you to refill at will.

All in all, decent but much better available. Price-tag is average,"}
{"text":"Really good spot for breakfast conveniently located to shopping spots nearby.  I had a good ol hearty bacon and eggs breakfast, but man the plates are massive.  The pancakes seemed to be really good as well.  

The pitcher of chocolate on the counter where the waiters picked up dishes caught my eye.  I'm assuming this is to pour all over some of the pancakes.... man I can just imagine the sugar fits that must go on at this place.  

This is a definite repeat the next time i'm in the area. : )"}
{"text":"After coming back from a long roadtrip arriving in Laval my Boyfriend and I decided to stop for breakfast . 

I was very well prepared and well presented no complaints . Great service and not expensive : about 40$ + tip for 2 people 

I loved the Strawberry Mango Smoothie a
made with fresh fruits"}
{"text":"Bonne portion!
Service super courtois. Deux chois de patates (classique en cube/ ou les patates pilés) Il y a même l'option de faire un mélange des deux."}
{"text":"I have no idea why I go to breakfast places. I make the best omelettes yet I get talked to eating out and ordering omelettes in hope that I will have some competition.
I ordered the brie and mushroom omelettes and as I expected very bland. no taste. Even the Brie was crappy.
Service was good as she went outta her way to speak to us in english. That was the 2 stars. 
Although my family ordered eggs, bacon and that looked OK but I know anyone can cook that."}
