{"text":"Great gyro at great prices. Fast service, excellent staff.  Platters are great which includes salad and fries.  A lot of locals love this place."}
{"text":"Clean and quiet atmosphere.  If you love gyro meat you'll love this place.  $11.00 for the tradition gyro meal (gyro, fries and drink).   They are very generous with the portions.  I could only eat about a third of the fries.  My gf couldn't finish her gyro.

You can get extra dressing, which you'll probably want."}
{"text":"Great food, but I wish the cook had worn gloves while handling my food.  That doesn't seem to be a law in Pa though . Someone asked what the difference in clean hands and clean gloves are. I don't want to get into an argument . If good hygiene is practiced, maybe nothing. But, hands can have germs under nails , or cuts. That's all I will say"}
{"text":"It's good but I still like Mike and Tony in the southside. A bit pricy."}
{"text":"My mom heard from a friend of a friend that My Big Fat Greek Gyro was super great and that they eat there all the time.  So when I finally came back to Pittsburgh for a visit, mom figured it was as good of a time as any to try it out.  We headed down the road the restaurant was on.... and then drove right passed it.  One u-turn later, we almost passed by it again. *Cue sharp turn to the left into parking lot.*

This place is itty bitty and easy to miss.  And good luck finding a spot to park- the business next door has signs everywhere saying that they will tow you if you park in one of theirs.  Luckily that store was closed when we came.

It's a charming little café set-up inside, but very small.  I suggest going at an off time to get a seat or expect to make your order to-go.  They have a good selection on their menu and a few vegetarian items as well.  Prices are very reasonable.

I ordered a veggie gyro and a spinach pie.  The spinach pie was greasy and bland; I would recommend choosing something else on the menu.  The veggie gyro was a lot better but pretty boring too- lettuce, tomato, onion, and feta.  Show us vegetarians some love and throw on sautéed mushrooms or something!  (I know, I know...there aren't that many vegetarians around. But it sure would be nice of you).  Mom had a chicken gyro and seemed to like it.

The guys working behind the counter were really friendly, but there were a lot of girls hanging around at the bar.  Not sure if they were girlfriends or potential girlfriends... either way it was just kind of strange seeing some girls sitting around not doing anything (eating, working, ...talking).  Plus they were taking up retail space in this small joint.

I think My Big Fat Greek Gyro has the potential to be a great spot to grab some casual Greek food, but first they really need to amp up their menu.  Aaaaaand maybe get some more parking."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service! Never been there and I was driving through the area. Credit card machine did not work on two of my cards so they just gave me the food. I felt horrible because no one does this act of kindness anymore, plus they deserve the business. Came home and ate the gyro which was really good! I don't do Yelp reviews so this review says a lot! I definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Friendly staff, healthy in terms of fresh salad & protein. Exactly, what I was looking for while traveling."}
{"text":"This place has had a few months to work out the kinks and I think they have. The express window that was added seems to help a lot during the lunch rush.  The place itself is really clean and inviting.  The food has gotten better in my opinion.  The first time I went my salad was nothing special but since I pass it a lot I decided to go back and every time I do I've been satisfied.  The produce seems fresher and and product seems to be turned over to the customer faster.  I like the grilled chicken gyro personally. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic gyro! Perfect ratio of meat to toppings and excellent tzatziki. The fries are also crispy and delicious. The guys who work there are always super nice and very accommodating."}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken gyro platter to go tonight. $11 for three ounces of chicken and 7 fries?? Such a poor value. The pita bread and salad didn't do much to round out the meal. My boys were still hungry once the food was gone! Making sandwiches now.  The food, what there was of it, was good."}
{"text":"Not quite Mike and Tony's, but a good gyro. Clean place, good staff, cheap enough, and a large portion gyro."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best Gyro place in the North Hills The platter is a meal fit for a king"}
{"text":"Nice but simple place. Fast service. Reasonable prices.. Freshly made gyros and platers. I like the fries. One of our favorite hangouts."}
{"text":"These are the best Gyro's in town.  The guys who work there are always very friendly and the service is great!  Eat in or take out options.  I always get their basic gyro and the cheese balls are great too!"}
{"text":"One of our go to spots in Wexford.  Friendly staff, delicious food, speedy service, reasonable prices.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"After living in Chicago for the past 8 years, I got to know a good gyro. My Big Fat Greek Gyro can hold their own against any gyro place in Chicago. Service was great--the people that work here are so friendly. You can tell they truly appreciate their customers and love what they do. And the food was amazing! The gyro is hands down the best in town. A generous portion of meat, fresh toppings and perfect amount of tzatziki sauce. We will absolutely be coming back for more fresh, delicious gyros. And it's always nice to support an independent business. If you haven't tried this place, please do. It will not disappoint."}
{"text":"What a delightful experience. We were greeted immediately as we entered.  Casual place with great food. The gyros are delicious as are the Greek salad and fries.  Spanakopita was really good. The owner takes great pride in this place and did not disappoint. Will definitely go back when we are in the area. Very good service."}
{"text":"Staff was good and gyros were excellent. Like another poster mentioned I wish there were better/more vegetable choices but for the price and portions you won't hear any complaints from me."}
{"text":"I recommend the crispy chicken sandwich in a pita as really tasty, large portion for price.  My mom enjoyed soup - young owner said his mom makes the soups.  Went twice so far, enjoyed food both times, will return.   Clean, including clean bathroom."}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere and fantastic service.   The staff here is very friendly, the service is quick, but don't let the bar-ish atmosphere fool you : the food is first rate and the place is kid friendly."}
{"text":"Bought a living social deal for this place and I was very impressed.  I got the traditional gyro and there was a TON of meat on it.  My wife got the gyro platter which came with a side salad and a generous amount of fries.  They put so much meat on her platter I had to help finish it (which I totally didn't mind).  Very clean dining area with a modern vibe.  Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Well this place isn't called my big fat greek gyro for nothing. This gyro was certainly big and fat. I thought that it was as good as a huge gyro can get, the ingredients were fresh and the tzatziki sauce was also very good. Warm pita with the typical lamb beef combination meat. The service was fast and friendly. Good place to stop for a quick lunch or dinner. They also had some other smaller greek options on the menu along with the option for a chicken pita if you want to roll that way."}
{"text":"Great resturant!!!  We took the whole extended family for lunch and everyone was happy! -even the pickiest eaters enjoyed steak and rice.  The ingredients were all fresh and the meat was flavored well.  Pitas, pita bowls, and salads... Yumm!!  They also featured fresh cut fries that were delicious!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Greek food? The name is great!  I appreciate a good pun.  Also, service is quick."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times lately, and probably a dozen times in the last year or so.

First, the staff is always friendly despite sometimes big crowds in the market square for lunchtime on a busy spring/summer day. This wasn't always the case, and in a previous review, I said that I was unhappy with the cashiers.  Since they've got the girl on the register (yes, only girl in the building) things have improved!!

There's something wrong with their ticket printer in the kitchen, so not all orders make it back there. While I'm in agreement that the customer shouldn't have to worry about this --- realizing they are calling orders in the 140's, and you are ticket number 132 -- don't be afraid to bug them about it.  I do!

The food is generally good across the board.  An order a Gyro and French Fries should satisfy just about anyone (and their appetite.)

The chicken, gyro, and greek salads are good.  While tasty, they do have a tendency to be inconsistent with the generosity of key ingredients.  The chicken salad I got today was light on the chicken, and light on the feta.  A salad ordered a couple days ago had a decent amount of each.

Prices have gone up at multiple locations including Downtown and McMurray."}
{"text":"This place is the best... it's my go to spot for a gyro. I also get the cheese balls and the best baklava I think I've ever had. You get your food always within 10 mins. This place is a must try."}
{"text":"My Big Fat Greek Gyro has some good gyros.  Only problem is the prices keep rising since they opened.  The staff also isn't too friendly, it seems to be all about just a job to them instead of making people feel welcome.  The atmosphere is weird as they have a bar right near where they prep the food.  It just makes things seem awkward.  I still go back when I have a gyro craving but usually get it to go."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to the Mt. Lebo location and the McMurray location on a number of occasions and I've been to the Market Square location for work lunches.  All locations have great quality and value.  

We had a deal from LivingSocial on our last visit and we were not disappointed.  We had two gyros and an order of fries.  We had our two year old daughter with us and they recently added hotdogs to the menu, so we grabbed that for her.  

The portions are HUGE.  I am not a small guy and we both had leftovers for the next day.  The amount of meat that is in the gyro is unbelievable and the gyro sauce and vegetables are so fresh.  We were not sure if our daughter would be a fan of the gyro meat, but even she loved it.

To top it all off, the employees at the Mt. Lebo location were great.  They were pleasant, helpful and extremely accommodating.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This should not get a star

The obnoxious owner was acting like a complete jerk. And was rude. He would not honor an Entertainment book coupon. 

My wife went there and gave owner her coupon for 25 per cent off if you spent $20.
She did and gave her a hard time.
He said he did not authorize it. And would not honor it. In the end he honored it.

Buddy you are in a service industry and rely on good manners to your customers. Don't forget that."}
{"text":"I will say this: they do have big, fat Greek Gyros. Personally I wouldn't be ordering anything else off the menu. The gyros are filling and delicious. Some of you may be asking, \"But are they authentic?!\" Who cares! They're massive! 

The service could be a little quicker, but in their defense it was quite busy on a Saturday afternoon. Also, one of the plants was dead, which just confirms that this shop is run by a bunch of guys. 

Conclusion: Eat a gyro. Enjoy."}
{"text":"LOTS of meat on the gyro... Not the cheapest, but the volume of the gyro makes the price justifiable. They are quick to make them, and takeout is a breeze... plus, Market Square is amazing!

My co-workers have complained that there is actually too much meat on the gyros, and they don't think the meat-pita ratio is right. I disagree, but a few of them have said this. I would note that none of the guys at the office have said this, and only the women have, but the sample size is likely too small to make a blanket statement... this is just what i've noticed. In my opinion too much meat is NEVER a bad thing. Right?"}
{"text":"I've become quite the Greek food fanatic in recent months and this place had me excited when I was downtown recently. The inside is cute, clean, and spacey, but the food was a total miss. Here's my breakdown..

Service: It's a bunch of guys running the joint, kind of bro-ish. This is fine, but they seemed bored or annoyed that I wanted to order.

Food: I got an order of hummus and pita and meat grape leaves. The hummus tasted like it came from a store-bought pack, and while it wasn't bad, it did nothing to have me wanting more and did not have much flavor. It also came in a small, Styrofoam bowl, and was like $3-4, I believe. The grape leaves were OK, but again, nothing special. I was overall, pretty disappointed in the lack of creativity, but it wasn't something that I couldn't stomach.

I'd go back if I was in a hurry and walking through Market Square and craving something that resembled Greek food, but it will not be a destination and most likely not recommend."}
{"text":"Deceivingly Excellent Gyro Place. We eat here a LOT! Because everything is fresh, made to order and tasty! Deceivingly because it looks like any other strip mall place. A few tables, counter, dudes cooking food. But quality is the key. French fries are consistently fantastic. Hot, crispy, steamy inside, perfect. Every time. Gyros are huge, full of meat and are hard to finish. Grilled chicken salad is a gem! They put marinated chicken on the grill and throw together a mean, delicious salad chock full of always fresh lettuce, cucumbers, olives, feta, tomatoes and etc. Very generous with the chicken. Cannot be beat for the price."}
{"text":"I grew up  eating Gyros and have enjoyed them in small towns and big cities across the country. It is really a difficult food to screw up. The Gyro I had at My Big Fat....was indeed big and fat- but bigger is not always better. The meat was very dry and their gyro sauce (that they seem to be quite proud of) is kind of weak. Seems like just sour cream and dill.  The fries were barely average. I'm always curious to see which local spot has good or different fries, and I was told by the cashier they were 'really great' before ordering them -- so I ordered them. Eh not really. Finally-The price seemed high; Gyro, fries and drink for almost $14, 7.50 for the Gyro alone. That's silly. The atmosphere was great and we loved the outside patio  near the bike trail, but the Gyro and fries missed the mark.  I will give them a second chance on our next bike ride  but will share the next Gyro and skip the fries."}
{"text":"Lots of food for the price and quality too! The salads are always fresh and whether it's chicken, gyro or steak, the meat topping is always plentiful and juicy. Yes, the neighbor is a jerk with signs that say don't park here, but I usually do just to try and make her mad. I've never seen more than one car in her spaces and I've worked in the area for 7 years. The outdoor seating is great. If you're looking for formal, sit down , forget it. This is a family place, where you get family service and a lot of people in bike shorts or jogging attire because of the proximity of the trail. I've never had issues with the timing - they say it'll be ready in 15 minutes and I drive over and it's ready in 15 minutes. If you're hungry and you don't want greasy fast food, there's plenty here to fill you up without getting you round."}
{"text":"I think this place is great. The food is good, healthy and the price is good. The people that work there are always very friendly. So glad they are very close to my Salon in market square."}
{"text":"The name has changed to The Simple Greek.  The quality of food is still excellent, but the portions are really cut back.  The gyros have less meat and the fries are half the size or less.  They are serving fresh cut fries know, which are better.  They are trying to expand and commercializing, which it destroying what was a good business."}
{"text":"I order out here quite a bit for lunch, and it's very good. Seating is limited so it fills up fast. The gyro salad is huge, and impresses me with the amount of food...10 Kalamata olives were on the last one I ate... as well as the quality of the ingredients.  They have a tendency to overcook the gyro meat and the chicken here, so I ask for it less done when I order, and they comply. The sandwich portions are also generous. The service here is always friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Dry food. I ordered the pork souvlaki, and it was awful! The bread was burned. No alcohol served. Pretty lame..."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try this place for awhile, but with so many other awesome options in market square, it had fallen to the bottom of the list. 

M and I were attempting to eat at another very well-reviewed restaurant today for lunch (whose name will remain a mystery until I get to go back), but after taking our order, they never came back with our food.  After 45 minutes and our lunch hour dwindling, we told them we had to leave and headed instead to My Big Fat Greek Gyro - and I couldn't have been happier.  I love gyros, but am watching calories, so I decided to go with the chicken gyro today.  The chicken was grilled perfectly.  And there was a ton of it on the soft and flavorful pita.  They piled lettuce, oregano, onions and a very surprisingly lemony tzatziki sauce on the meat.  It was a little pricey, but all in all a very good substitute meal. 

I will be back for the grape leaves and baklava soon!"}
{"text":"For convenience factor if you want to eat outside in Market Square and the staff being pretty friendly, I'll go with three instead of two stars. Mike & Tony's is clearly a better option.

I've gotten the gyro salad. Large quantity of gyro meat which is a huge plus because the salad is just okey dokey. I am however quite disappointed with the yogurt dressing... is there anything in it besides yogurt? No? Ok. MBFGG is a decent addition to the Market Square staple but it has room to improve."}
{"text":"Holy smokes!  I found out about this place from another Yelper.  It was delicious!  We ordered two gyros, and it was so big that I simply could not finish mine.  It was heaping with gyro meat, sauce, lettuce, tomatoes and seasoning.  I couldn't finish the whole thing.  We felt bad coming in 20 minutes before close, but the young man at the counter didn't seem to mind at all.  He was attentive and friendly.  I asked him how long they were open, and he informed me that they were open 7 years on May 28th.  He then pointed out that they were having $5 gyros on their anniversary.  I asked him if that's how much it cost when they opened 7 years ago, he shrugged and told me that he only worked there two years.  
When I was his age, I didn't want to work somewhere for more than a few months.  You could tell that they liked their jobs and that the restaurant was well kept.  It had a diner/pizzeria feel to it, a counter and stools with a few tables around.  Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"I was exceedingly in need of nourishment so I willingly shelled out $10 for a mediocre gyro salad. The gyro meat was of a sizeable serving, but much too salty, and placed atop a pathetic pile of iceberg. The pita bread was over-charred and crunchy. My Mediterranean ancestors would not have been pleased."}
{"text":"This is the best Gyro (proper pronunciation is yee-row) in da Burgh. Owner operated - say hi to Brett - always behind the counter. Tell him Steve sent you. If you visit here 2x, he will recall your name!

At one point Brett had the opportunity to RE-brand and become part of what became The Simple Greek franchise of The Profit fame but turned it down to continue to do his own thing, thank you very much!

Go have a couple of Gyros  and an order of French fries  which is enough to share. Fountain drinks are free refills. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hmmm.. first off my apologies to the other reviewers.

Pros - The place was very clean (this got them a second star) and the two teens behind the counter were pleasant when not watching the basketball game on the big screen which seemed to distract them a bit since at the time we were the only two in there and the fries came out way before the Gyros.

Cons - Not Greek by any stretch of the imagination and I love well made street Gyros. Bagged pita like you get at the grocery store. Sour cream as opposed to yogurt based tzatziki, shredded lettuce, diced yellow onion, and sliced tomato on top of average Sysco foods Gyro loaf. Basically all heat and eat. My wife did order the steak Gyro which was tough and unseasoned so no help in star power there.

I'm not a food snob but I'm not a McDonalds kind of guy either. If you want to fill a hole and not really picky about flavor then this place might be for you. For me... One and done.

Sorry guys"}
{"text":"This place has wonderful gyros. Each gyro has large portions of meat with nice seasoning. I would highly recommend My Big Fat Greek Gyro in Wexford."}
{"text":"The service here was good, the food came out fairly quickly, but I don't see myself going back here anytime soon. 

First of all, the prices are all about $1 more in the store than their online menu. Not a big deal, but for the price we paid, I would expect better quality food! My friend and I ordered a bunch of different things off the menu to split and I was not blown away by any of it.

A steak \"platter\" was $11.50. I thought it was a good deal until it showed up. It came with about 5 tiny pieces of steak and the rest of the plate was covered with lettuce, tomato, a few pieces of pita, a huge serving of dressing and a side of fries. It sounds like a lot of food, but what it turned out to be was barely any meat and a bunch of cheap fillers taking up all of the space on the platter! Those platters are extremely overpriced.

The rice in the grape leaves was still kinda hard and the baklava seemed like it was a few days old...a little soggy and not flaky at all! The cheddar balls were ok, but it is difficult to mess up deep friend cheese!

They have a prime location right in market square, so I was quite shocked at how disappointing their food was!"}
{"text":"If you are expecting consistency in the food or service, this is not the place for you.  Having worked in a restaurant (in another state - many years ago), I know that consistency, high quality, and exceptional customer service are achievable - even during peak hours with a teen aged staff.  Every time I am in this place, it is chaotic, unorganized, and extremely slow.  The final straw for me was my experience last night when they made a mistake on my takeout order (which happens - no big deal).  But when I got home with what I expected to be the corrected order, only to find out that they made the same exact mistake a second time, I vowed never to eat there again. After all, it shouldn't be that difficult to send me home with a grilled chicken platter. I did give them 2 shots to get it right :).  But, deep down inside, they must have thought I needed a gyro platter."}
{"text":"When you finally get your gyro, its a pretty good one.  I also had the hummus and it was fantastic.  Ok, so the food is pretty good.

The atmosphere was weird.  There were people just hanging out and some kids were repairing an iphone for the owner.  I walked in and there was no greeting at all, you get that feeling like you walked in on somones private conversation.  When I ordered, he said \"20 mins\" and I looked up and there was only 3 tickets on the wall...really?  I was also a little put off at the attitude that my order puts out the guys at the counter.   As I sat there they kept giving the long wait times which I couldn't understand.  Shave the lamb, add meat and toppings to pita and serve.  20 mins?

If you can overlook the uneccessary wait times and the, the family/business drama being aired freely and the hangabouts taking up valuable real estate, the sandwich is good.  

If there was any sense of service or appreciation for the business, this might be a totally different review as the food was good.

If you love gyros like I do, see my other review and try the gyro place in canonsburg."}
{"text":"Just stopped here and was blown away by how rude the service was.  I've eaten here before and loved it, but could not believe the lack of business sense I just witnessed.  Bravo in loosing a well networked loyal customer."}
{"text":"Our 2nd time here, my husband who use to go to NY for gyros said these are equal if not better. My salad with chicken is great!"}
{"text":"Prime location in Market Square means it gets quite packed during lunch.  I visited and ordered the hummus and gyro.  The gyro had too much filling and the meat was overseasoned.   Not a bad place to go for a fast lunch but I'm not sure I would seek it out in a city with a lot of food options."}
{"text":"I'm weird. I generally don't like lamb, but I'll eat gyros, and Big Fat Greek Gyros makes good ones. I also really liked the grape leaves and the tater tots. The guys that work here are fun to talk to as well. Neat, laid-back, cheap place."}
{"text":"Located inside of the White Oak Mall shopping mall, just a few doors down from the Giant Eagle.

First impression was that it was very clean inside; decent atmosphere and renovation for the new restaurant location.

You pick whatever table you'd like and then you make your order at the counter.
There aren't any real menus, but there is a huge menu sign on the wall near the counter.

The staff was very friendly and patient with our first time ordering.

The food was pretty good with HUGE portions!!

PROS:
Huge portion;
Decent prices;
Clean location.

CONS:
I wish there was more than Gyros as a main course.

Overall, though, I would say to give it a whirl if you're looking for something quick and good ;)

Really, it was just an average Gyro Joint, but it goes to \"just a bit better than average\" due to the friendly staff, cleanliness and portion:price ratio  ;)"}
{"text":"Sure, it's not the most authentic joint, but the food is great, reasonably priced, and the employees are always super speedy and super friendly."}
{"text":"I was walking through downtown quite a bit and passed by My Big Fat Greek Gyro several times in one day. Being famished, I decided to stop in and grab a gyro. I ordered the traditional gyro without lettuce or onion.

The place looks fairly clean and the associates were nice and expedient. I didn't waste any time in trying my gyro once it was handed to me. I am well aware of the process of making the gyro meat and am always surprised at the difference in recipes between different establishments. The biggest mistake many gyro places make is not balancing the spices with the base ingredients.

MBFGG misses the mark with that balance. They have over seasoned both the tzatziki and the meat. Not only was the meat over seasoned, it had an extra helping of filler added; I could no longer taste the flavor of the meat in any of it. If you can't taste the meat, what is the point of getting a traditional gyro?"}
{"text":"Good service and a powerful gyro, pita size was kind of small, which meant you had to eat most of it with utensils then half way through the meal, you could pick it up and eat it sandwich style. The service was good and the gyros came out pretty fast. I guess they have a fat man gyro challenge with 7 gyro's content and 3 pittas and if you win the meal is free and you get a shirt... Makes the place seem a little authentic and traditional. Vegetables on the gyro was just a mound of lettuce and tomatoes wish there was a little more veggie variety not a big deal tho. I'd recommend the traditional sandwich here. 

And there's a roundabout in the entrance which really added thrill to my experience here. I will come again... If I remain alive"}
{"text":"This place is so close to my parents house that on several occasions it's a go-to in terms of take-out when we have family over.  The food is really good and fresh - not to mention they give you a whole lot of it.  

I've never been able to finish an entire gyro here, but I rather split it with someone else.  They cram so much lamb on the pita that maybe they should stuff the pita into the meat!

We've ordered other items on the menu such as the cheese sticks and chicken fingers for my nephews and niece and they have also been good.  

I will mention one thing, that while I really enjoy a good gyro on occasion I can't help but regret stuffing my face with this good stuff because gyro and fries aren't always kind to the tummy!"}
{"text":"This location has not changed since the franchise appeared on \"The Profit\" television show.  I ordered a gyro from the old menu (the one seen on t.v. With the tater tots).  It was excellent."}
{"text":"I ate here for dinner tonight with my girlfriend.  We were originally going elsewhere but did not have reservations and so sort of stumbled into here and boy am I glad we did.  The decor consists of Pittsburgh items like a signed Crosby jersey and photos of the bridges.  There are also card games on all of the tables and we played 20 questions while waiting for our food.

For dinner my girlfriend and I decided to start out with the hummus and pita chips.  Whenever it was brought over to us I was surprised by the small amount of pita and large amount of hummus.  The pita was warmed up though and tasted nicely, as did the hummus, but we had extra hummus even after adding copious amounts per piece of pita.  I decided on the traditional gyro for my entree as did my girlfriend.  It was served with a fork as there was no way you could wrap up all the meat in the pita.  I was also pleasantly surprised by how moist the meat was and it all tasted wonderfully.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  I was surprised by how much I actually enjoyed the gyro and would recommend it to all."}
{"text":"My Big Fat Greek Gyro has the best gyros and the fastest service I've ever seen. I work across the street at Giant Eagle and all it takes is one quick phone call to be chowing down in ten minutes. 

My order always amounts to $13 and includes a large crispy chicken gyro, fries, and a drink. 

The gyros are made right when you order, are always steaming hot, contain lettuce, tomato, and the 'special' sauce. wrapped in foil, and a fork. 
The fries seem to be cooked right away, always hot and delicious. 

There is always plenty of space to sit, comfortable seating, available condiments and a plethora of the much needed paper towels.
 
The wait staff is friendly, polite, and quick to accommodate. 
You'd be hard pressed to find a better, faster, lunch option for less than $13. Try them out, you'll be impressed."}
{"text":"The food is usually food pretty good but if the young kids are behind the counter when you pick up your takeout order, CHECK YOUR ORDER, mine has been wrong on a few occasions. I understand its a family business but having what look like 13-14 year olds running the place behind the counter is a little odd to me. But when the food is right its good."}
{"text":"Excellent gyro, or chicken.  The salad on the plater was fresh and the fries were hot out of the fryer.  We finished off with Rice Pudding and Baklava.
Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"During lent, i recommend trying the fish gyro! It's amazing! This place is awesome in every category."}
{"text":"Excellent gyros, my dad orders from them every week so he loves it. The gyros are a pretty decent size, and they have a bunch of other things to order as well. The inside of the restaurant is well maintained and is a good place to grab a quick dinner with friends"}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times as it's close to my work, and this time has finally forced me to write a review.  For this visit, I ordered the grilled chicken platter which is grilled chicken (obviously), fries, lettuce, tomato, pita, a side salad, and tzatziki.  First off, I can't stand their tzatziki.  It's runny and bland.  There's none of the fresh yogurt/cucumber  feeling that I usually get from tzatziki.  If you can pour tzatziki like it's liquid, there is a problem. I could go on about this forever because I love tzatziki, but moving on.    

The chicken was dry and bland, the fries were overcooked, and generally it was so unimpressive that it forced me to write this review.  The side salad was decent though, so it's got that going for it, which is nice."}
{"text":"This place has the best fries in the universe!  The ENTIRE universe. 

How many times have I dredged the bottom of my purse to scrape together pennies because my stomach demanded these fries? ???? Countless times. 

Thank you, kind people.  You bring the NOMS"}
{"text":"Man alive do I love their gyro salad. So dang good! The load it up with enough meat to make at least two salads and the pitas are always delicious. I enjoy the tzasiki sauce as opposed to the Greek dressing, they are happy to give you whatever dressings you prefer. Service has always been prompt and very friendly. Definitely our go to for Greek in the north"}
{"text":"OK I've been back because I felt like a Gyro.  Prices are still high. They over a student discount.  Service is a little faster but avoid busy times."}
{"text":"All I can say is excellent. Staff is very warm and friendly. We have been here more than 5 times now. Food is superb and portion sizes are extremely generous."}
{"text":"I personally love the gyros. My friend has gotten the chicken sandwich and said it wasn't as good, but I can definitely vouch for the gyros. Delicious. I never get the sauce, however."}
{"text":"I am completely obsessed with their chicken salad. It is seriously the best salad I have ever had. Their pita and hummus is pretty tasty too. Place is clean. Service is great. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here countless times.  It's near my house.  In Chicago, I used to eat great Gyro all the time and it keeps me coming back hoping they'll get it right.  All this place needs is properly trained cooks.  It might be possible that the owner doesn't know how to cook or maybe just doesn't have it in them to train their staff properly or both.  It's very simple food.  

The best thing they make (sometimes) is their greek dressing.  I am assuming they make it but don't care because it's (sometimes) really perfect.  Although, a few times we found someone put feta in it.  Egads.  I am updating this today and dropping a star because it was all vinegar in the dressing and I couldn't even eat my salad.  Terrible.  Sometimes has turned into rarely!

My go to order is a grilled chicken greek salad.  The portions are great, the olives are wonderful and they give you plenty.  Good pita when they don't burn it and Tzatziki Sauce which sometimes they forget to put in my to go order.  The problem is with their meat preparation.  They overcook every meat product on their menu including the Gyro.  It's good quality and I have enjoyed it on occasion but  I've had shoe leather Gyro more often than not here and have to make sure to let them know not to overcook it.  

The chicken is a crime against chicken.  They over marinate it so that you can't get your teeth through it anymore.  There's probably an acid and they've cooked it before they cook it.  They over cook it until it is dry as dust.  It doesn't matter when we stand over them to watch them grill it fresh because it's still rubbery and almost inedible most of the time.  If you just walk in off the street they'll give you some they've already grilled and is in a holding pan!  I give up and will never be back."}
{"text":"Eh. Not really impressed. The pita was dry and the hummus was a little too bland for my taste. I haven't had the gyro (vegetarian) and that seems to be this place's claim to fame. Maybe I'm missing out but probably not. It looks like it's a popular hangout spot for teens and a prime pit stop for trail goers, but nothing to compliment except that they sell cold beverages for hot days."}
{"text":"Love the new setup - Chipotle style ordering for your gyro. Lentils, rice, both or a salad for the base then you get to choose from a slew of other toppings. We got a couple bowls, some Greek style fries, and some dessert, all of which were awesome."}
{"text":"This place is just big, fat, awesome! The guys who work here are super friendly and are very talented at getting you fed - and happy. Gyro's and sides are delicious - you won't go away hungry. Everything is super fresh and delicious - cooked to order, so it's not just sitting under a warming light all day. The price for a gyro is around $7, which I find reasonable, and about the same as I've had in many other places. It's in a very convenient location, and is definitely a better option than a stale submarine sandwich from a fast-food chain."}
{"text":"A huge thank you to the staff!!! In just an hour they were able to throw together an amazing platter for our company lunch, at the LAST minute. The food was amazing, as always, and everyone at the lunch could not have been more pleased. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Cant miss place. Good food, good value, good service. I have eaten here 4 times in 30 days and it never fails.

There are weekly specials that makes it more attractive to come in.

They also offer a 3 lb gyro challenge that I regretfully did not attempt due to time restraint. $30 but it is free if you complete the challenge in 1 hour.

This is a chain around Pittsburgh started by cousins of the owners of Mike & Tony's in the South Side."}
{"text":"Wow, what happened to this place?  Stopped here to pick up a take out kids meal for my son who was home sick. After four days of not eating, he was asking for this food.

Paid the $8.00 for a kids meal which was a gyro platter and fries. In the past, that has ALWAYs  been enough to fill him. Their regular adult sandwiches are $7.50.  But when I opened the styrofoam box what did I find?  A few dried out shavings of meat and about 9 fries. I should have taken a photo but my phone was already filled to capacity. And to top it off, fries were ice cold, as was the meat. and we live about three minutes away.  

I don't know if the kid thought I was getting it for myself or what. But if you are going to reduce the portion size, don't charge that much money. Now I have to go out and get him another sandwich.... but .... not here. Definitely not here.  

Most of the great Yelper  reviews were over a year old. Did this place change management?"}
{"text":"Best gyro in Pittsburgh! it's one of my favorite places to go for lunch in Market Sq.
The taste is great and the portions are really big. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"The gyro was very large.  I could still feel the one I ate days ago.  It was flavorful and they can substitute the sauces in the menu if they are not too busy.  Service is always with a smile.  The best part of it all no reservations necessary because they somehow find a way to fit you in."}
{"text":"One of the best gyros in the area!  The food is a lot for the money and is made pretty quick.  Cucumber sauce is great!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  I try to venture to a new place each week for lunch since I work downtown (dahntahn).  Some coworkers kept saying you HAVE to go get a Gyro or salad at My Big Fat.  I finally gave in and wished I hadn't.  
Most places downtown at lunch are packed, so this wasn't a downside, but the staff was rushed to a point of being frantic.  This made the already tight space evenmore uninviting and stressful.  I ordered the lamb gyro platter and got it about 10-12 minutes later, not sure why it took so long, but whatever.  I returned to my office and was pretty pissed when I opened the styrofoam container and found that they really skimped on the lamb and didn't even give me a pita!!!  
The olives were not pitted and sadly I bit into one almost breaking a tooth....Some of the veggies were starting to oxidize and were quite limp.  
Not going to say it needs condemned, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Been there a few times.  Fast in and fast out.  Staff is courteous.  There is nothing \"greek\" about the place but that is fine.  The Gyro options were good, and very ample in portions."}
{"text":"Kay needed to find a First Commonwealth branch, and we both needed economical provender, but where in swanky Mt. Lebanon would we find such a thing?

Subway wasn't gonna happen. 

That's when I remember that My Big Fat Greek Gyro had a restaurant here. 

The interiors were bright, clean, and the employees were welcoming and not without a sense of good-natured humor (something that it all too absent these days, but I digress...). A humming electric knife shaved lamb from a vertical broiler, and well, what else would someone come here for?

The gyro is served in cone form, sheathed in foil, and holds a plastic fork. I enjoyed the moist, filling meat of course along with the fresh vegetables and grilled onions, but to my taste nodules, the climax of the sandwich was the cottony pita bread corset that barely held it all in. Its flavor was coal-caressed, and its texture was contradictory; how could something so soft be sturdy enough to carry all of that meat? Eating the pita alone would have you think it was too delicate for sandwiches, and it is unquestionably pleasant enough to consume naked. Hummus wouldn't even be required. 

My only grouse with the gyro was that the tzatziki sauce was almost invisible to my radar if you follow me. It was just a white sauce that was just...there. Perhaps some more dill, cucumber, salt, or other herbs could jolt it from the doldrums. Despite that, this was a lauable and muscular gyro.  

Our sides were dolmades and yes, tater tots. I know, tater tots are part of an ironic, comfort food/ childish throwback movement now, but I like them simply because they're a diversion from french fries, which I often tire of, and when done well, they can be quite flavory as well as offer a compromise between the light crunch of a frite and the heavy crunch of a potato chip. I couldn't discern whether or not these were made from scratch, but they were crispy, salted, damn, damn good, and went famously with grand old Heinz 57 ketchup. 

The oily, smooth grape leaves (dolmades) simply vanished in our mouths and were as fleeting as a fantasy. I don't even remember chewing them. One minute later, they were gone. 

MBFGG is looking to expand and already has several franchises throughout the metro area, but I worry that with more MBFGG's will come a decline in quality. I'm hoping that doesn't happen either way for MBFGG is currently an affordable, delicious alternative in a suburb where your choices are either cheapo chains or pricey fine dining establishments."}
{"text":"Had a big fat Greek Gyro.  It was a big fat good greek gyro with the typical yogurty sauce, tomato, onion and lettuce.  New location.  Not crowded, staff was very nice.  Put PIta on the grill, once warm made the big fat Greek Gyro.  Had a spanakopita also.  They have soup, salad and a few other sandwiches, also have a few deserts including baklava."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Im really picky on my gyros and grape leaves and they nailed it! Delicious sauce... Salads.. Hummus and pita! Will be back! Yummy!!! :) friendly service too"}
{"text":"We had dinner in on July 29 2014. 2 regular Gyros , Spinach Pie, Meat Grape Leaves and 2 drinks.  Bill $28. A little pricey $$$ compared to others in area. Spinach Pie and Grapes Leaves werent homemade nothing special. GYROS were fresh with plenty of lamb. They didnt fry their meat which is good. Clean with friendly staff... 2 Stars at best.
I am a Greek and know what real greek Gyros etc should taste like.. this is not  Greek owned and the food is not authentic. Just a food chain of processed foods ...  Really folks its clean and they try but nothing special. There is NO Yiayia here :-)
Over priced and you serve yourself. Dont waste your money.
Not surprised they are out of business."}
{"text":"Not what we thought it was. Meat tasted like it was frozen prior to re cook."}
{"text":"We've been here several times for lunch and dinner and consistently have great service and even better food! I highly recommend the traditional gyro, but the grilled chicken is also excellent. On a cold day I love the Avgolemona (chicken, lemon, rice soup)."}
{"text":"Food is good. Air conditioning is never turned on so it is incredibly hot! I feel bad for the employees on a 92 degree day it is cooler outside then it is in the restaurant."}
{"text":"My Big Fat Greek Gyro has some good gyros. 

Now to the downside - the prices are insane and the staff is not friendly.  

The atmosphere is more like you are in a public school kitchen than somewhere where you want to meet up with friends and enjoy a conversation.  I also have an issue when the same person handling cash is touching food."}
{"text":"Gyros, Big and Very Tasty. $7.00 for a Traditional Gyro. It might seem like a high price for one gyro, but try eating more than one of these awesome meat filled Greek favorites. They have Salads, Soup, and an assortment of side orders. I'm looking forward to returning.  Six locations in and around the Pittsburgh area, they must be doing something right. :-)"}
{"text":"Meh.

I ordered a Greek Salad expecting one as delicious as I'd had in Columbus at the Pitabilities food truck.  Silly me for thinking you could replicate such magic!  This salad... totally el boro.  Translation= BORING!

Iceberg lettuce (bleck), some kalamata olives thrown in and a bland yogurt cucumber dressing.  Big let down.  

I also ordered the grape leaves because I couldn't resist.  They weren't bad, I do like a lot of lemon taste to my leaves.  Not the best I've had, but definitely not the worst.  

Just underwhelmed all across the board."}
{"text":"I give bonus points for generous portions, so it should be a warning sign that despite these gyro's indeed being big and fat, they were only a big fat disappointment.  

They are very bland and tasteless,.  The service is off too, they gave me number 55 and didn't call my order up until they had already gotten to number 83.  I got a side of fried mushrooms so that may have thrown off the timing, except that the fried mushrooms were still frozen in the middle when they served them to me.  

It was a hot day, so I could have used them to cool down my drink, but I would have cracked a tooth if I tried to eat them.  I do give them bonus points for the outdoor seating with a great view in Market Square, but that's true of every restaurant in the area, so you can enjoy the view and better food elsewhere.

If you like massive portions of bland food, the prices and portions here are good, but unfortunately, the food, service, and preparation are not."}
{"text":"I would like a Jyro. LOL, I love Pittsburgh. 
Authentic: No. (thats Mike & Tony's)
Best handheld food in MS: NO. (thats Winghart's)

Nothing really wrong with this place, its just that if I am going to fair to restaurants that deserve 4 and 5 ratings this is a 2."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall restaurant is quaint and shares a great garden with Farmhouse Coffee. It's near my parent's new house so I figured I needed to try it. I went around 11AM and there weren't any open seating inside, so I ordered a basic gyro, grape leaves, and hummus with pita for my kid. The girl working said 15 minutes, and I'd been warned about the timing.  I sent my stopwatch and walked to the Farmhouse for a drink.

After 20 minutes I came back in to check on my food, which was nowhere near almost up.I hung out and watched the two girls working there cut meat, get supplies from the back, deal with customer's money and answer phones WITHOUT ever putting on gloves. Terrible habit! (It would've gotten 3 stars if they had better hygeine.)

The one girl (tanner, dark hair) was running register, cutting meat, wrapping fries, answering phones and worked pretty quickly. Most customers looked like regulars, so they were ok waiting forever for good. But the girl working the prep table (a little stockier, dark hair pulled up) was taking her sweet time doing anything. She kept looking around at customers, people watching instead of getting orders out. My food took 30 minutes to make.

The food itself was pretty good. The meat was well seasoned, but the taziki was too much. Good sauce but a lot of it. The grape leaves were just average with way too much oil. The hummus was bad. Less than average and I eat hummus everywhere. Not good at all and didn't even let my four year old (for whom I bought it) finish it. 

I will try again, since it's very convenient for my folk's house but there are some other decent joints to eat right near here that are probably better."}
