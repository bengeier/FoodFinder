{"text":"Went there today (Sunday evening) to be met by the following annoyances: 1) aggravating rave music;  2) onions mixed in with the lettuce, so that even when you order 'no onions' and they don't intentionally put any on, you still end up with onions;   and  3) doofus male employee (resembling Chris Pratt's character on \"Parks & Recreation\") with earbuds who tried to throw away my magazine when I went up for a refill (to be fair, the female employee was great) . Have to downgrade my rating.  This is the best place for sandwiches, subs, or a light meal in Kent. The subs are among the best I have had; am not sure what exactly makes theirs so much better than most, but they are, and everything is freshly sliced, prepared, assembled, etc. Rotating menu items and specials are also usually a treat. Not a cheap college sub shop, but if you prefer to enjoy what you eat, this is the place to go. Note that it is on the small side, with perhaps 6-7 tables, but there is patio seating in the summer in bucolic downtown Kent. Servers are notable: no gum-chewing, text-obsessed teenyboppers here, just attentive, quality people, closely supervised by the owner--and it makes a difference that is notable. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I have order pick up orders from Frankling Square 3 times and EVERYTIME I show up and they never even have my order started.  Today I got a bunch of attitude,like normal, with the gal behind the counter saying, well look at the line and were sooooo busy. Well why did you think I called 15 minutes ago?! 3 for 3 .  Food is average, literally, dont waste your time."}
{"text":"This place charges you a 4% surcharge to use your credit card. I politely asked the owner about it, and he started getting all shaky and complaining about the fees. If he wants to take credit cards, he should abide by the legally binding merchant agreement he signed with both Visa and Mastercard which explicitly forbid merchants from charging extra fees for using credit cards. If the owner is going to break the rules in this instance, who knows what other rules he is breaking....like sanitation and safety rules.  Additionally, the food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"This place has great sandwich's with a NYC deli feel.  You will not find a place like it NE Ohio with great food.  The owner is a big race fan and walking in you will see the decor matches his interest.  I enjoy the Reuben's here.  For Kent Stater's it is good but you only get sandwich with no side and for $7 it is a little out of the college budget.  You might run into your professor here."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are okay, but it's the little things that will keep me from going back. Like charging for a drink refill, charging 4% to use a credit or debit card, but then not taking a check."}
{"text":"I don't know about beating a NY deli, but it definitely was good, and there were plenty of menu options.  The staff was very friendly (but efficient) too.  We enjoyed our sandwiches - my husband got the philadelphia (super yummy) and i got an italian sub (can't remember which one).  The sub was good but not spectacular... The philly was delicious though, and I was jealous.  Based on our experience I'd suggest going with the specialty sandwiches over the subs, but that's probably a matter of taste.  We'd definitely go back, though."}
{"text":"Surprised this place only had 3 stars but had an early lunch here today and had a turkey sandwich on what with colby cheese, LTO and mayo. Simple tasty sandwich that hit the spot. I recommend this locally owned deli."}
{"text":"Sandwiches aren't anything special and the owner can be a bit rude to people - then afterwards he'll come up and be nice once you're sitting down eating.  Kind of like getting beat up by your boyfriend and the next day he sends you flowers.  Additionally, the 4% surcharge for credit card use is inexcusable - go to Subway or Ray's around the corner, this place sucks."}
{"text":"Expensive, but the best corned beef you can find in Kent."}
{"text":"Love their pizza & sandwiches. And...this is important: Awesome coleslaw. ;) And...we insist on supporting small, local businesses.  You'll fall in love. Might cost you a dollar more a sandwich - but well worth it. Higher quality ingredients, local business family you'll be supporting, and tasty!"}
{"text":"Cute little sandwich shop in downtown Kent. I got the 6 once veggie (#14) and it was more than enough food for me. All of the staff I saw there were nice and friendly. The prices were pretty good too."}
{"text":"How could you not like this place?!? They have the best food in Kent, hands down. It's never too crowded, they always have excellent customer service and the food tastes fantastic!"}
{"text":"Total Douch Bag Manager! Me and my Girlfriend wanted to check this place out so we went for lunch today. Total Mistake! I got a regular sandwich and my Girlfriend wanted just Corn Beef and Bread But there menu has no way of ordering that except by getting a Ruben with No cheese, sauce or sauerkraut. I told the 3 works behind the counter, just Meat and Bread only. So we get our drinks, bottled watered and \"watered\" Down Lemonade and they would bring the food to us. When my girlfriends food comes there is cheese on it so she waits in line to get it fixed. Before she can say anything he says \"OH you wanted Sauerkraut and Sauce?\" \"Then it's not a Ruben!!\" Then grabs the sandwich and slams it in the trash and says \" What do you want?!?!\" So my girl says \"NOTHING\" sits down and says i want a refund. So one of the women give us a refund for the sandwich and apologizes. But the Manager never apologizes for being ignorant Douch Bag! He apologizes to a fellow employ for losing his temper but not to us. I was so close to pulling him over the counter punching him a few time and Yell \"Look you Stupid M****erF****er don't give me or my girlfriend an attitude for your own F***ing Fault of F***ing my sandwich up than acting like its our fault. You're menu needs an option for a plain sandwich, is that too hard to ask instead of numbering almost everything and making you order though numbers when the person is right there making your sandwich. Acting like there is a secret back room where they make sandwiches.  Manager/Employer Whoever the F*** You Are, We are never coming back because of your total lack of decently and respect. Could of said \"Sorry, we will make a new one right now\" We weren't even upset until you had your little S*** Fit about F***ing everything up."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time as a senior, I'm now very sad that I didn't discover this place before now. I ordered a Jersey sandwich, except on sourdough and it was amazing. Very relaxed, laid back, clean place. They also have great workers, that will let you customize your order if you don't want certain aspects of one on the menus. Decently priced as well: I got chilli, a sandwich, and a drink for 12 bucks."}
{"text":"I wish this place had more reviews and only 3 stars? C'MON!   I am not big into delis but my husband, son and I have been meeting up for lunch once a week to break up the long work days/long days at home with a crazy toddler.  For us, it's great because the service is always quick so before our little one starts to go a little crazy ;) Plus the location is pretty awesome. We all love the big windows, plenty to look at and in nice weather you can even sit outside.   I am a fan of the gyro and have had it my last 3 visits. My husband always switches it up, usually getting the Thursday special though or a reuben. On our last visit we had the hamburger soup which I really loved.   Portions and price are fine for me, no complaints there. I always leave full and happy so I am one content girl!"}
{"text":"if i were reviewing just the food, this place would get 4 stars. the sandwiches are truly delicious. however ...  1) the prices. my favorite sandwich + the laughable combo \"deal\" is $11. no thank you.  2) the credit card policy. it's now legal to pass along credit card fees to the consumer, but up until this year it wasn't. sleazy.  3) the owner. he's a terrifying rageaholic, and it doesn't matter who is on the receiving end -- employees, customers, vendors, i've seen him go off on all of them. it is a mystery to me how he stays in business when he treats everyone so badly.   4) this is a pet peeve, but my god, the spelling/grammar. just awful.   go to dave's. the prices and sandwiches are better, and i've never been screamed at there."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches.  Combo meal option (additional $4) does not seem like a good deal.  (The  potato salad came in a tiny dipping sauce container.) Two sandwiches, one combo came to just under $20."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. Sandwiches are a bit pricey for what you get. About $12 for a 12\" submarine.   I did not like that they do not offer free refills.   I also feel like their furniture does not fit the atmosphere. The tables and chairs are something you would see in a family dining room not a restaurant.   I think I am only going to visit again if they have some sort of deal going on."}
{"text":"Franklin Square is a Kent staple. They offer a variety of excellent deli items from traditional sub combinations to more interesting sandwich creations like \"The Horseradish Whisperer.\"  I'm definitely a fan. I usually go for a prosciutto and cream cheese bagel with one of the daily soups."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good atmosphere.. it's a great place to stop off for a lunch, it's a deli, so expect a more laid-back genre of food."}
{"text":"Prices are rather ridiculous. This is Kent not NYC. Over $15 for soup, sandwich, and a 9oz or so coffee. Soup was microwaved. Sandwich was average in taste and not that big. Kent is pretty horrible for food options and I still will most likely never be in here again."}
{"text":"The food is typically good, but good food doesn't make up for a psychotic and rude owner and high prices. The owner openly yells at employees for anything, and yells at customers as well. He has made fun of customers for their order if they want something tweaked to their order. He had no respect for people that work for him or support his business. His outdated approach on how to run his business makes it no surprise that he has had to cut back on the hours of the place. In addition, the amount of meat and cheese on the subs and sandwiches has dwindled over time so if you want to pay a lot of money for less, this is your place."}
{"text":"I can relate to the comment above about the owner (see below).    3) the owner. he's a terrifying rageaholic, and it doesn't matter who is on the receiving end -- employees, customers, vendors, i've seen him go off on all of them. it is a mystery to me how he stays in business when he treats everyone so badly.    I am from out of town and wanted to have some sandwiches delivered to a wake on short notice.  I was simply calling to see who might be able to accommodate my request for a deli tray.  The owner went on and on about how it was the worst day of the week for him and that there is no way he could help me.  This man deserves to go under."}
{"text":"Management is lucky to still have a business and should show respect to anyone willing to work for him or eat at his restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this Deli! I've been going here on and off for over 20 years when ever I'm nearby. I even bought a Gambaccini print here many years ago that's still hanging in my office today. Today I got the Cubano, it was fantastic and always happy to support local businesses."}
{"text":"This place, at one time, with the palate of a typical college bro, might've been good. I don't really know how they are still in business, other than the fact that they charge $1,000 for every item on the menu. The hot sandwiches seem undercooked and uninspired. The cold sandwiches taste like pre-made subs you'd get at the end of the day from your local grocery store. I get the feeling that they've lost biz from local bizzes movin' in, so it might have resulted in raised prices and not as fresh of food.   I do remember them having a pretty tasty, spicy pulled pork special. Also, their soups are pretty decent. I like that they have a daily special and soups of the day.   Overall, kinda hope this place just goes away."}
{"text":"I had a very pleasant experience at the Franklin Square Deli today.  I thought the prices were fair, especially when considering the quality. Although, I did find the macaroni salad portion a bit small with the combo meal, but it was home made and quite good.  The crab salad on pita was delicious, very well seasoned and not too much mayo.  The pita was toasted and I think it might have been brushed with garlic and oil, so good!"}
{"text":"I have never been more insulted in my life! The manager who was training a young man was sooo mean to his trainee - totally belittling and a total control freak. Talking down to him and when the young man would do something he would take over and push him out of the way- he told the man said degrading things to his employee to the point where I said he could train the boy better if he was nicer to him- the manager told me to mind my own business! Are you kidding me? You know praise is the best motivator - no one should be talked to or treated the way that man was treating his employees- I hope that young man gets out of there before he suffers any more abuse!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the place the now-adult kids want to visit when they come into town - because it's always fresh and generous! A good value and very clean. Wasn't aware of the debit/credit extra charge, but heh, it keeps the prices low, eh?"}
{"text":"The food is almost always delightful and the atmosphere is nice. Service is hit or miss but in this style of place that's not why you're there. So many options I want to try I always end up buying more than I can eat, but even when what I get isn't wonderful, it's still a great bang for your buck. One of the first places in Kent I recommend for a quick, tasty, and satisfying lunch."}
{"text":"The only deli in town but would beat out a NY Deli any day. Big sandwiches - all the classics plus some with a twist all the owners'. Awesome potato salad for an extra bit of $ - don't skip it even if you are on a diet! Some specials include sandwich, side, and drink so keep your eyes open for the offers. It's a small place so groups larger than 4 will want to buy their meals to go and walk to the river for a picnic."}
{"text":"A great sandwich (and more!) shop in Kent with fresh quality meat and ingredients in generous quantities, good variety of specials, and superb homemade soups that are rotated daily. (Side note: Shout out to Manhattan Mushroom, my all-time favorite!)  I believe they offer delivery service now if you're into that sort of thing and they do a pretty good job of keeping their sandwich specials and soups of the day updated on their website."}
{"text":"For Deli Sandwiches, this place is about as good as it can get. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Franklin Square tends to get a bad rap because of its prices, but I think the quality makes up for it. If you want to spend $6 on a sub with lunch meat that has a rubbery feel to it, feel free to go to Subway. If you want a New York style sandwich with high quality ingredients where they shave the meat in front of you and add that extra zing with oil and spices, come here.   If you follow them on Facebook, they post their daily specials, and they are affordable.   The Cuban is probably my favorite sandwich there, and is only $6 on Wednesday's.   I usually keep it pretty basic when it comes to my deli sandwiches, but my wife and I tried their Friday special last week, which was a pastrami marmalade melt. It was fantastic. I would have never thought those ingredients would go well together, but it totally worked. Unlike anything I had ever tasted."}
{"text":"This place has been a cornerstone, literally, of Kent downtown for more than three decades. Its owner has shown dedication to the community in the face of a lot of adversity.  But, that is not why one eats there. It is clean. It is decorated with very cool sports car racing images and art.  And best of all the sandwiches are great as is the service.  Eschew the chain restaurants and support a good local eatery."}
{"text":"*Random Kate Fact: When I was a freshman in high school my friends Dan and Shannon (who were seniors) used to bust me out of study hall to go have lunch here.  I've gotta give five stars to the small town, hippy run deli which has changed naught a bit since the first time I ever bit into a Reuben sandwich there in 1985 (that's 22 years ago, for those of you who are as math impaired as I am.)  They still serve up some of the best sandwiches I have ever had, they still give you a big ass pickle with said sandwiches and there is still a line out the door at lunchtime.  Le AND Yum.  *Oh, and **Sparky - if you happen to be reading this review (which I know you are) my school ditching shouldn't be a shocking revelation to you... *smiles sweetly*  **Yep, y'all, my Dad is reading my reviews.  I guess I'll have to tone down the reports of drunken antics once I return to San Francisco."}
{"text":"My father's childhood friend's cousin owns this place, so my father brought me here to eat while visiting Kent for a family reunion. OH MY GOD.... My sandwich was exceptionally delectable. I had a #17 the \"New Yorker\" which is a hot corned beef and swiss sandwich on Rye, so moist and juicy, with the most delicious spicy mustard I've ever had. The bread was top notch, fresh and just right. It was like Goldiocks came in and chose my sandwich components. Definitely would come back. Amazing spot :)"}
{"text":"The people complaining about the prices here are the same people who consistently order the cheapest thing on the menu & complain when they got drunk & \"spent too much money at Taco Bell.\" Good food will cost you more money than a dollar menu item. If you don't care about the quality of your food, stick to Subway or gas station subs. You're totally right - you can get more for your money there. But you're eating a lower quality product. Your choice. I choose quality, which is why I choose Franklin Square Deli.  Everything here is simple. You're not going to find sandwiches with a dozen different fancy sounding ingredients. They're not going to try to impress you with things like aioli or arugula like chain places like Panera do. They don't need to. The food speaks for itself. The menu is straight up and everything I've ever had is fantastic. My personal favorites are the #2 (turkey sub) and the chicken salad, but I've never had a bad meal.   Tips: bring cash to family-owned places like this. Small businesses that give their customers the convenience of credit card machines pay so much money in fees. Also, try the chicken salad. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I read the reviews before visiting this deli; they stated negative comment about the owner and they were right. I have been here twice now. The first time I witnessed the owner yelling at a worker in front of costumers. The second time I was there the owner was significantly rude to me. The food was great both times, but due to the service my friends and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Let's just say that if I wanted to be disrespected, embarrassed and downright pissed off I could've gone to work and at least gotten paid for it instead of wasting my time at this crappy hole in the wall deli!!!!  I'm not sure what crawled up this particular employees butt or if anything else could've even fit up there next to his head but someone was PMSing this morning & it wasn't me! I'll admit, the three staff members behind the counter when my boyfriend & I walked in were friendly, one of them even brought out our food to the table for us. However, I ordered a lemonade & a Ruben with just meat & bread on it- piece of cake, right? Wrong! My lemonade WAS NOT lemonade, it was so watered down that I would've gotten more satisfaction from a rain puddle full of stagnant water with mosquito larva in it. I ended up throwing it out on my way home before it was even half way empty. But what I should've done is thrown it at this older man (with short peppered hair & glasses) behind the counter & here's why:  When I received my sandwich, there was Swiss cheese on it, no biggie. I wasn't mad but brought it back up to the counter to have it remade. I stood inline just like everybody else & waited my turn, but before I could even get one word out I was being screamed at. This peppered hair jerk literally said (in the most sarcastic tone ever!) \" Let me guess, you want sauerkraut & sauce on it\" and rolled his eyes. I just shook my head \"No\" and then he grabbed the sandwich & screamed \"What does it have cheese on it & you didn't want cheese\" with attitude & threw it away. I was only going to ask that it be remade, I wasn't mad until this jerk opened his mouth and PMS's all over my entire day. So I naturally got mad & said I want a refund. The girl who gave me back my money was cool but you could hear this douch bag going on & on about how people like me drive him insane & ruin the world, etc... Well, I feel that way about people like him so...Also, listening to religious gospel while trying to enjoy lunch, not cool. Pretty sure the reason why this moron had race car pics all over the restaurant is probably because he's one of those men who have a tiny dick & have to buy \"impressive\" toys to make up for his lack of manhood. So unless you want a heeping pile of \"f**k you\" then don't waste your time visiting this  hole in the wall deli & it's \" I have a stick up my butt\" manager."}
{"text":"I like this place... it has a great deli feel to it.   I usually order a sub when I come here, the buns are always soft and taste fresh. They also offer a wide variety of sandwiches and (some) soups to choose from. The only downside to this place are their prices... you could go to Subway and get a foot-long for a few bucks cheaper. Although the variety and fresh ingredients makes this place worth trying out."}
