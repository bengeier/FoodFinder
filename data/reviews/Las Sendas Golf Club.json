{"text":"Here's the deal...the course itself is very nice although the greens were not in terrific shape. My problem was with the facilities. We had flown in from montana and had to change into golf clothes. We were directed to a men's restroom which was nothing more than a toilet, right next to the mens locker room. And this was after much discussion as to where we could possibly change. Instead of giving us access to the mens locker room to change into our golf clothes, we had to change in a toilet. Very disappointed in the facilities. Course was great but so are many others in this area. For $135 round, not a great deal by any means, considering what u get."}
{"text":"I decided to take advantage of the low summer golf rates in the valley, and try Las Sendas Golf Club. Several golfers that I had played with on other courses suggested I try it.  When I arrived, it was evident that there was construction of a new pro shop, and I had to wander around until I found the temporary pro shop in a trailer. Not being deterred by the immediate construction area, I was anticipating the round from everything I had heard about the course.

The golf course is great.  They have a very nice driving range and practice area, and it is included in the price of the round.  I was favorably impressed, as the range was in great shape, the yardage was provided to the flags, and the hitting area was level. Plus, because it wasn't busy, I could spend as much time on the range as I wanted, before I played.

The fairways are in excellent condition, and the greens were true.  There are houses along the golf course, but they are set back enough that you do not have to worry about hitting them with errant shots.  Several of the holes are fairly straightforward, but most are outstanding.  Some I consider  the most picturesque in the area, and because of the elevation, many holes have wonderful views of the valley.

Apparently they have new owners/management, and they are really working at making the club a first class experience.  I was favorably impressed, and am adding this to my list of favorite courses in the valley."}
{"text":"Great course, great views. However, beware of marshalls. They are up your butt all day! It ruined our round
 It was cart path only because of overseeding. We were told we were 1 minute behind, then 2 minutes behind, then back on track in hole 9. What's the rush? There wasn't anyone on the course!! Never once was anyone behind us. Then on hole 11 we were told we were 2 holes behind. Seriously, we finished our round in 4 hours 20 minutes. Not bad for a lot of walking because of cart path only. I'm down here from Colorado for the next 2 months. I won't be coming back. I get it it if we were holding someone up. Not the case. Go somewhere else and enjoy your round"}
{"text":"One of the most challenging courses in the valley. A great test of golf!! and the views are spectacular. If you want a challenge, make sure this is on your list no matter how far it is. True desert golf!"}
{"text":"Had a 7:08 tee time and check in was easy, loaded my clubs, and got me on the range without incident.  The first tee welcome and course explanation were great.  The course was in excellent shape!  One of the top in the valley.  The greens roll true and were very fast, fairways and bunkers were well taken care of.  The course was tough, but fair.  I was pleasantly surprised the staff was helpful, professional, and customer focused.  It was quite the opposite from what I've read on yelp.

The cart was slow and I mean slowwww.  My only other minor gripe was how the staff blocked the cart path 3 times to remind us we were 3 minutes behind.  Call me nuts, but if you didn't stop us we would have ended on time vs. 10 minutes late.  The reminders were polite and I actually wish more courses did that- pace of play is out of control everywhere. Overall, I  would definitely play there again.

Thanks for a wonderful visit."}
{"text":"Staff was great in spite of a computer glitch causing them to double book.  We still got out on time and played in the expected time at 4 hours. The course is challenging and plays much longer than the stated yardage. The course was beautiful and in in great shape.
Had lunch in the restaurant after golf. In the quest to be different some of the sandwiches are a little odd. Food was good just nor great and the staff was very good."}
{"text":"Las Sendas Golf Club is a premier place to play. You aren't going to find anywhere else in the valley with the views that you can find here at Las Sendas. The staff in the Golf Shop are friendly, accommodating, and very helpful. Outside staff helped get bags ready and cart setup for the round so by the time I checked in with the guys in the golf shop all I had to do was head up to the range. They obviously had a fantastic overseed this year as the course is in great shape. I heard they will be cart path only until the 20th, but if you are a golfer who knows to grab more than one club when walking to your ball, it's not a big deal. 

The grill after the round is the place to go if you want to catch a beautiful sunset, great food, and cold beer! If you are visiting the valley and want to find a great course to play and one that is well worth the money, Las Sendas will be the place you are looking for."}
{"text":"course conditions were a 5 out of 5
its very lush and greens were outstanding
staff was very courteous and nice
course layout is challenging and at the same time accessible for golfers of all ranges
its a hidden gem in the area and i have it as one of my favorites in the area"}
{"text":"As a PGA tour player I'm proud to call Las Sendas my home. If your looking for a challenging course, or an enjoyable round with breathtaking views this is the course for you. I find the course to be in great shape year around, with friendly faces and exceptional service.  The patio at Las Sendas is absolutely stunning with views of the city, cold beers, and great food. Recently the patio was remodeled with misters, fans, and shade allowing you to still enjoy in the summer heat. When my wife and I want to go out there is not much discussion on a place. She simply says let's head to the patio!! 

If your playing in the summer, you have to remember that there is a transition period where there will be brown spots in the fairways and a few rough patches. However it is 110 degrees outside and there is not much you can do. 

I still find it a wonderful place to play and practice even during the summer months.  By far one of my favorites in the valley!

{"text":"Great golf if you can score a deal. Can't beat the view on 18 and where else will you see a bobcat take down a rabbit!"}
{"text":"Played this course on May 17th, 2014.  Good layout but the greens were like concrete and the sand traps had almost no sand in them.  Got a good deal on Tee Off but won't play this again even if it were free.  They must cut back on maintenance during the summer."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful golf course! The greens roll fast and true. The scenery is amazing and the staff were very nice. We will definitely play here again on our next trip to AZ."}
{"text":"We were looking for a late spring round of golf, and decided on Las Sendas, after hearing great things about the place.  The first thing I noticed was that the $60 rate includes range balls, which is something that I'm not used to.  Superstition Springs had a comparable tee time with a rate of $50, but when you add in up to $10 for range balls, the two courses are comparably priced.  It leaves a great first impression when you show up, pay the advertised rate, and don't get nickle-and-dimed just for warming up.

The second good impression came when I got a call from one of the guys in my group, who was running late because of an unexpected freeway closure.  I mentioned this to the starter, who was more than happy to accommodate us.  The staff was very friendly in general, and they almost seemed like they liked having us there, in contrast to some of those courses where they herd you around like cattle.

The actual course was excellent.  There were plenty of interesting holes, the layout was challenging, and the setting felt pastoral.  Some courses, Kokopelli for example, have houses so close to the fairway that any slightly errant ball has a good chance of getting lost or hitting a house.  At Las Sendas, there are houses, but they left the fairways wide enough that it felt wide open, and in most cases, even left a desert buffer between the houses and the fairways.  And perhaps best of all, this course offers some of the best scenery I've seen at a golf course in Phoenix.  The 18th tee box, among others, offers a sweeping view of the Phoenix area; constantly throughout the day, I was cursing myself for not having brought my camera.

After a very enjoyable 18, we ate lunch at the clubhouse, and decided we wanted to play more.  They got us back out at a very reasonable $20 replay rate.

Now I'm not a very experienced golfer, but I think I have a new favorite public course.  Even my colleague, who is experience, said after the fifth or sixth hole, \"This might be a little premature, but I think this might be my new favorite public course in Phoenix.\""}
{"text":"I'm not giving this place a review for the obvious reason of it being a golf course. I have no experience in that area, but before you ignore my words, hear me out.

I have driven up this small mountain, past the restaurants, golf courses, houses, and cacti to reach the top of the road, because that's what this review focuses on.

Go to the top of Las Sendas in the
middle of the night and see the city lights twinkle like you've never seen them shine before. You'll realize how small you really are and just how vastly underrated the greater Metropolitan area of Phoenix really is. Sure, it's Mesa - but you get to see pretty much everything from up there. This is one of those spots that makes you fall in love with Arizona all over again.

I know this review had nothing to do with what the actual establishment is for, but at the same time, you want to be able to have little jewels like this to enjoy once in a while."}
{"text":"Hello fellow golfers. I'm doing a review for Las Sendas golf course in east Mesa. Now. I know Las Sendas doesn't really qualify as a \"budget\" link. ( not should it) but I found a good deal online and I wanted to give it a shout out.
First. Any course you can find for $50 in the winter time in Arizona of this quality is a great deal. Las Sendas is a great course that wraps around a small mountain and through some nice housing areas. The fairways are in amazing shape and right now the smell of citrus blossoms and wild flowers really makes spring golf amazing.
Second. Take a minute and browse the club house and pro shop. Talk to the staff. They know their course and can help you navigate it.
If you are reading this, considering coming to the Phoenix area for spring training, all the arts and crafts fairs, and great entertainment, put Las Sendas golf course on your list of places to play. 
Enjoy the East Valley!!"}
{"text":"The good: for $40 it's well worth it. Good views, fairways were in great shape. Water stations every 4/5 holes. 

The Bad: greens were rock hard and had an appearance of being over dry, (I hit a towering 9 iron 150 yards and left no divot) tee boxes were extra fluffy. There was also no beverage cart on the course. I know courses are prepping for winter grass but there also seemed to be maintenance guys on every hole. Kinda distracting. 

Overall: course is fun and challenging, but there are better options"}
{"text":"After my experience and writing my original review I also sent an email to the head pro at the course to describe my experience and frustration.  Alas to my dismay I still have never gotten any response from anyone at the course.
Let me reiterate yet again that there are soooo many courses to enjoy here in the valley you can go ahead and skip this place because apparently the don't care if you had a bad experience or felt that you were treated disrespectfully.
I have told quite a few people about what happened and the feedback was less then flattering.
My new goals for 2014 are to lower my handicap, loose about 15 lbs and do everything in my power to make sure that everyone I know hears this story and I can only wish that their rate of play goes down.  I'm not going to hold my breathe but it still makes me warm and fuzzy to think that it just might."}
{"text":"Course is great.....the majority of staff is very rude.  I'm certain the members like most staff employees, but don't as the visitors.  Very rude indeed!!!"}
{"text":"The course has amazing views, the fairways were well kept and the greens were true and fast. The first Marshall (Dale) was EXTREMELY abrasive and rude (on 6). We were on an 11 minute pace  but had fallen behind the group infront of us. The second Marshall was kind and courteous.  When we mentioned the interaction with the first Marshall he said,  \"You are right on time, enjoy your round.\""}
{"text":"I was in Mesa, AZ for a work trip and found this place on here. I loved the pictures and what everybody had to say about the course so I decided to try this out. Mind you, I live in NJ so I had very high expectations for a golf course in Arizona. This place did not disappoint at all. I loved it and had such a great time golfing here. 

It was extremely cheap because it was the summer time and 110 degrees out. We got to warm up at the driving range for free which is something you don't get a lot in NJ. The course was in great shape and the views were incredible. We saw a wild boar, lizards and a lot of other wild life. 

It's a challenging course that isn't very forgiving because of all the hazards. Once you're in the hazard or even off of the fairway it's very tough to make up for it. All in all, amazing course that is love to try in the winter when it's only 70 degrees. 

PS: The food and drink in restaurant was very good!"}
{"text":"Great course very challenging, you should play from the tees according to your handicap otherwise you'll be struggling throughout the day greens are fast and true. The food and drinks are always good after a day of golf"}
{"text":"The reviews posted don't do this course justice. I'd say the reason I'm not putting 5 stars is because the course is in east Mesa, so it's 40 minutes driving if you're in Phoenix. 

That being said, the drive is worth it. Especially if the course is in good shape and the greens are rolling well. Apparently the previous reviews insinuate the course wasn't in that great of shape...having played it several times, I can attest to the course being extremely playable and fun-you have to check with the pro shops ahead of time regarding course conditions, and it's something I always do. That being said, Las Sendas is an awesome track. It's extremely challenging, even for scratch golfers. Very narrow fairways on some holes, and the course meanders through the desert. The practice facilities were top notch, and I can't wait to play here again.

This course is the gem of east Mesa!"}
{"text":"Nice course, but I recommend they go private since their Ranger makes it well known he doesn't like the public playing here. We had a group of 8 guys in town for the holiday looking to enjoy a nice round. Nothing worse than having a ranger yell at you the second you hit the turn and decide to grab a hot dog and a few beers that you need to get on the tee box. No beverage cart on the course and an uptight ranger (properly named Dick) managed to ruin a perfectly good round. If you decide to play here with the mall cop attitude Rangers. I suggest you save your money and bring your own beverages and lunch. They treat the members like royalty and the public as second class citizens. We finished our round 15 minutes before the course average pace of play.  But nothing is worse than having an uptight ranger berating your group at every hole to pick up the pace. On a side note the ranger for the front 9 was friendly and accommodating. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm raising my stars to a full Five! Played here on  Wednesday and the course was immaculate. From the minute you drop your bags off to the staff here. This golf club is one of the best in my opinion.

The course is pristine perfect including the greens and fairways. The greens here were in better shape then the North Troon Pinnacle course I played on Tuesday and at a third of the price!

I teed up with a couple of snow birds one from Colorado and one from Canada and we had a great time!

Hope to return here again!"}
{"text":"Nice faculty and the staff was friendly. Everything was first class accept the golf course. The course is loaded with blind shots. If you play it all the time it might be OK, if not it sucks. Nearly every green is higher than the fairway so you cannot see the surface on them either. I do not hit it very high so the greens are nearly impossible to hold if you can hit them.

If you want to enjoy the sunset go to the 19th hole and save yourself 4 hours of frustration.

I do not recommend this course"}
{"text":"The golf course was not in great shape.
The greens looks as if they were lacking water.
They were very inconsistent and bumpy. I was told they were not going to start preparing for over seeding until the end of September but there was lots of evidence of it out there.
Fairways were plugged and maintenance crews were everywhere.
I agree with other posts that the starter was rude. Told us they have a strict policy of keeping up with the group in front of you and they keep on you about it.
Makes for a very hurried round and not enjoyable at all.
The course is hard enough as it is without all that going on.
There are more friendly places to play and I will not be going back.
This is not the first time I have played here and am a 10 handicap player.
Also our cart died on the last hole. 
The other cart in our foursome had to push us in.
The tee time was at 7:59 so it should have been charged up."}
{"text":"The good. Course was challenging. 

The bad. Our group was treated so badly from start to finish. Managers and marshals were very rude and condescending. Beware if one person in your foursome gets sick and is a no show they WILL make you pay for them. No mercy. Plus they charged us the high season rate when we booked the tee time, not the rate when we played. Heads up. 

Can't explain how bad the experience was. Wow. That is all I can say. Would never recommend this course."}
{"text":"I have really disappointed the last few times when playing golf at Las Sendas.  The course is in decent shape but the course has turned into a place old people golf as members, so the marshals will NOT tell them to get moving.  There was a group of 6 I front of us today and we had a 5 1/2 hour round.  Also, be sure and bring your own drinks because there is never a cart girl and the snack shack was closed.  The green fee was $40 but if I would have known the frustration I would have to endure I would have just paid more to play some place else.  Also they are advertising a lunch special for $6-$7 and when we asked for this at the turn the woman at the snack bar said they weren't doing that anymore, Coors was on special but they ran out and the hot dogs were cold.  If you have to play here as I stated earlier BYOB and food."}
{"text":"Horrible experience at this course.  Played here a few weeks ago and the course was in horrible condition despite their claims it was \"overseeding.\"  It felt like we were playing target practice with the lawnmowers driving around the fairways.  We were rushed through by the greenskeeper multiple times, rudely may I add.  The beverage stations were closed down, and to make matters worse, there is not a beverage cart driving around.  It honestly had the feeling of a cheap public course.  I reached out to management to respectfully voice my concerns with the course and they sent me back a list of their awards from previous years.  Not helpful!  There are so many better courses in AZ, I recommend any other course.  The views are nice, but might as well go on a hike to see the views and play golf at a much better course."}
{"text":"Very challenging from the tips and black tees, and a whole different course from the whites.  Well-worth playing and always in great shape and I think the clubhouse serves a well thought menu. If I had to have a complaint i would say the service can be slow at times when eating. I've been there 4 times and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful golf, not for non members , book elsewhere!

With a couple from England today, we chose this course from the weathers of others.  I urge you to look elsewhere.

Pushed and lied to that wee were behind while playing one over par golf, the ranger was rude, rude rude!

All agreed last time playing this course even though it was a beautiful course , though greens cut so low all greens were extremely fast.

Then returning cart wants sis to take to the cart clean up tent and tout our bags to the car, forget it !

Lousy customer service!

Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous property and course. The sunset from the clubhouse is absolutely stunning with the view looking down towards the valley. My only complaint is that it may as well be at the far end of the earth from where I live."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner on the patio at sunset.  The Tuxedo Walleye was great.  The Pear Martini was also delicious. The live entertainment was a great plus too. Enjoyed the whole experience very much. The service was very good too. Reservations for the patio in the evening during snow bird season is probably a must."}
{"text":"As a traveling salesperson and a golf enthusiasts I've had the opportunity to play golf hundreds of golf courses across our great nation.. unfortunately this was an extremely unpleasant experience. It Started from the moment I arrived. The parking attendant was extremely rude and it appeared he wasn't happy to have his job. Next I was forced to pay more than I had been quoted which is not really acceptable. The golf course is in pretty rough shape. It definitely needs a lot more water. Some of the greens were very bumpy as well. I would chalk that up to bad maintenance from the crew who sets the flags in the morning. Another issue was the constant harassment by the marshals for our group to hurry up. We can only play as fast as the group in front of us. However in speaking with other golfers I heard that this is a constant issue at this course. Extremely rude Marshalls. Our last mistake was to stay and eat at The Patio. I don't mind paying for good food, but for what you get the prices here are outrageous. You can get the same meal at 1/3 the cost at any fast food restaurant. Definitely not the quality we expected on the course, the experience or the food."}
{"text":"Played this course on 6-27-15 it is very tough if you don't hit it straight and you cant avoid all of the bunkers it will be a long day for you.  Also course is very tricky lots of blind tee shots and a lot of common knowledge would be good here.  The greens were very poor just been aerated a week before however no mention of this on Golfnow or the website couldn't make a putt outside 4 feet if you are Ben Crenshaw.  Finally the par 3s on this course are very blah 3 of them from the black tees are less then 150 yards rather poor for such a supposedly high level course.  The clubhouse was nice however they don't let carts in the parking lot which is dumb so have fun lugging your clubs out to your car.  Finally the bar and grill are nice great service excellent food a very friendly lead bartender talked golf with no complaints about the bar and grill what so ever."}
