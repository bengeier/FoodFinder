{"text":"This was our first time here and we will be back! Such a gem in the East Valley!

From the outside, it looks much smaller than it is but it extends back and actually has more tables in the back. Don't let the size fool you or stop you from going in. 

The food is fresh and homemade. The biscuits are just like my Grandmother and Mom made as is the gravy. 

We both had a version of the \"Gambler\" breakfast and came away full. They did not scrimp on the fillings at all and you MORE than get your money's worth!

Our server, Lupe, was very friendly and welcoming, as was everyone there. 

This is the kind of place we need to keep in the Valley!"}
{"text":"Best food in the East valley, biscuits and gravy are awesome, real homemade mashed potatoes at lunch and home made gravy,  great homemade food, nice family owned restaurant (from MN too) just like the cafes I grew up with along with a lot of Midwestern specials like cabbage rolls"}
{"text":"Surprise! This little cafe I've past thousands of times without noticing it turns out to be Mesa's best kept secret!

I've been there twice in a week and so far I'm still amazed!

I ordered a cheese omelet with home fries and my husband had a BLT on my first visit.
Second visit I ordered the same breakfast I had  the first visit and my best friend had biscuits and gravy with bacon and one pancake on the side.

These folks prepare and plate food as if they are going to eat it! The home fries are to die for. The sliced potatoes are crispy on BOTH side with a tender center and take up half the plate.The cheese omelette took up the other half and was beautifully prepared. My husband said he loves the bacon there because they cook it thoroughly and its nice and crispy not wilted. 
My best friend took one bite of her biscuits and gravy and before she even finished chewing the first bite she was handing me her fork to taste it too. The gravy was fantastic but the winner was the biscuit - it held up to the gravy - it never got soggy and it was tasty enough to eat alone! Her pancake on the side covered the entire dinner p[late nad was delicious and perfectly cooked! Our server told us that first time diners will sometimes order a short stack of three and be shocked that all of them are plate sized!

If you're looking for a gorgeous place - forget it. It isn't gorgeous and there's and no view. If you're looking for real potatoes, sliced, mashed or shredded, nice crispy bacon this is your place! They take the time and effort to go that extra step to make BOTH sides of the potatoes are crispy and that the toast gets to you while its still hot. I love Two Seasons Cafe and will try to go in there weekly and order lunch and dinner foods. I don't think I'll be disappointed because they cook everything as if they are going to eat it. Brenda and Brian own and operate it. He does cooking and she is the smiling face up front! Staff is is prompt, friendly and that makes you want to go back again and again!

 Don't let the location fool you- this little, family-owned, restaurant serves up some huge flavors!"}
{"text":"It's a wonderful cafe! Great homemade food, good prices, and good service. Awesome hot beef and sour cream raisin pie!!!"}
{"text":"This is our very favorite breakfast place. The food is homecooked, good sized portions for a very good prices. Plus, we love supporting a family owned business instead of a large corporation. The food is much better.  Owners Brenda and Brian are the nicest people, and Kathy, one of the servers is great. We walk in and she remembers what we like.  Their lunches are delicious too.  Definately recommended."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this Cafe it is delicious and the people are fantastic. I drive past several cafes to get here because of the quality of the food. Every time I eat here I'm  satisfied.  Thank you for keeping the traditional Cafe alive!"}
{"text":"Love going out for breakfast and this place was fantastic! Great food and superb service. We'll be back soon"}
{"text":"While the business is not related to Frans, the cook and wait staff are the same.    Not sure why but better.  Brenda (hope I got the name right). Always has a smile.  Was going to Frans new place but at some point she stopped being open on Saturday.   Tried 2 seasons and it is now my go to place when I am in town.   I have heard lunch is as good.  I will have to try it."}
{"text":"Feel kinda bad since all the reviews have been so good. 

We've been to loads of Mom & Pop diners, just not impressed. Silverware was dirty, eggs came over hard, not over easy and bacon not crispy(ordered them over easy & crispy for 30 years, so definitely  a server issue) and she kept forgetting stuff. The coffee was weak and the gravy too salty.

The couple next to us left after two other tables got their food before them and they ordered first. 

Learning experience......"}
{"text":"I love to find these small hidden places. The food is good and fresh I made the Philly  sandwich and fries.  The fries were hot and crispy crinkle fries that were great. The beef on the Philly was fresh and you can tell it was homemade. I saw the owner bring food out and the customer did not look very happy I was surprised that she asked what was wrong and then finding out that she ordered the Sri g item she imeditaly told her that they will take it back and get what she wants it was very impressive to see that customer service. Well I am hooked and I will be back."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. The place is small. The menu blows you away with the all the homestyle meals they have. When I come back and I WILL!! I will have to try the walleye dinner. To sum it up \"this is the food your mama makes\"."}
{"text":"Home cooking and friendly service. If you like one off restaurants, and I do, you will love this place too. I had the Saturday special. Real goulash. Not fancy, not expensive, but good. Can't wait to come back. I recommend for breakfast lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great down home \"hole in the wall\". Not fancy, but cozy and like visiting granny's kitchen. Busy place, so little but if a wait, that's why no pictures with my review. I ate before remembering to take a photo. Biscuits are gravy were tasty. My eggs were cooked to perfection and I'm really fussy about how my eggs are cooked, \"over hard\" is not an easy request. Hash browns were light and not greasy, yummy! This place is not fancy but the friendly down home service and modest pricing make it a good place to dine out. I'm happy to support the small business owners that work hard like this one to make Mesa a warm down home experience. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This was our first time to the Two Seasons Cafe.  I knew we would like the place once we noticed all of the Minnesota references on the walls.  We were there on a Sunday for breakfast.  The pancakes are huge but I was there for the biscuits and gravy based on the Yelp reviews.  The reviews were accurate...biscuits and gravy were spot on.  We had a great (very direct) server.  The owner was always making sure we were okay.  Once we told her we were from Minnesota too it was like an instant connection.  I was bad and loaded up on carbs...pancakes, french toast and biscuits and gravy.  The french toast was amazing!!!!  We loved it.  When we were close to being done the owner brought out a sample of the mashed potatoes and gravy.   WE WILL BE BACK just for those again!"}
{"text":"No frills, no fuss, hole in the wall type place. My sister and I stopped in for breakfast. Parking was easy to find, although your choices are on the street or in a sketchy parking lot. 

The restaurant caters to the snowbird crowd, so the prices are low and the menu filled with no frills and no fuss hearty items.

My sister ordered an omlete, which was a little browned, but still good. Hash browns that were nice and crisp, but not over done, and sourdough toast, nicely buttered. We ordered a half order of the biscuits and gravy, both were on point flavor wise, although, not as hot as we'd have liked.

I ordered the Commercial. A roast beef sandwich on regular white bread with about two cups of brown gravy on it. It was a ton of food, but delicious. We also shared a pancake, that had a slight burnt flavor on the more cooked side, but still good.

If you're looking for a small hole in the wall place with real food, this is the place. If you're looking for a breakfast place that serves their omletes with a side of frilly salad on fancy plates, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"When you pull up to this place, you really don't know what to expect? But I gotta tell you, what a wonderful breakfast spot! The food came out super fast and it was delicious! Char took great care of us! We will definitely be coming back as part of our Saturday morning fun. Oh, and how could I forget...the prices are out of this world! You can't go anywhere else and get food that good at prices so low. Go check it out! The perfect example of not judging a book by its cover. :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this spot many times over the years and have seen many try to make a go of it well jackpot This little cafe is the best around  the food is spot-on home cooked and delicious. Fried potatoes, eggs, gravy, and chicken fried steak  were all perfect the coffee hot and super friendly service. The lunch menu looks as good we will be back keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service. We have been there twice. Same waitress both times. Orders were wrong both times. No apologies. When we walked in we were told to get up against the wall so we would be out of her way. No \"please\"."}
{"text":"Best biscuits and gravy on the East side of Mesa.....HAND DOWN......and the lunch special with the burger and a root beer float or a hot beef sandwich is spot on......and if you come in 3 weeks in a row the wait staff will know you by name and know what you want.....great small owned cafe"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday, the service was outstanding,  I  ordered the Roast beef Dinner it was okay, but was drenched with thin gravy and the zucchini was floating in it. My wife had the Fish Dinner and it was awesome. It left a bad taste in my mouth,  that they would serve the Roast beef like that, put the veggies in a side dish. I  have been a Chef for over 40 years, it was my first time there and questioning about going back."}
{"text":"I was completely amazed. The location is small but the food is spectacular. The wait staff paid great attention to all patrons. I ordered the Denver Gambler with hashbrowns and their famous gravy. I never had to ask for refills on our drinks. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good food with a friendly staff. We were seated right away in a booth. Quick service, food was ready faster than the McDonald's drive thru."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was not great. We did get our food fast, but waitress didn't come back to check on us or give refills. She brought the check and never asked if we needed anything nor tell us if we pay her or go to the register."}
{"text":"Good home style cookin'! The food is quality and fresh. My favorite is their breakfast, it tastes like you made it in your own kitchen. The lunch they have is also good, their warm sandwiches are very very yummy!!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent! Service was great! Highly recommend this place. We tried the bread pudding.....DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I can only rate this a four out of five becsuse I have only been here for breakfast. If the rest is as good as their breakfasts, it deserves a five. Nothing fancy, just down home good good!"}
{"text":"A fantastic Mom & Pop find! We wanted a simple, home made breakfast, not a chain restaurant formula. Service was fast, interior was immaculate and the menu was varied, but \"down home\". Biscuits and gravy was delicious and hearty. A half order was plenty. My DH had eggs and bacon and said bacon was done to perfection. Coffee was delicious and our server never let our cups empty. We'll be back for some of their liver & onions, stuffed cabbage and roast beef sandwich...we are so pleased to have a quick and delicious alternative to \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"I stopped by just on a whim, and I am so glad I did. This little out-of-the-way restaurant reminded me of down-home cooking and good people. The food was excellent, homemade not processed. I was amazed at how quickly the food came out. I had breakfast. My hashbrowns were cooked to perfection, the eggs were perfect. The sausage patties were to die for. None of those funny spices that so many places ad. They were extremely busy for breakfast but handled everyone efficiently and courteously. A thoroughly enjoyable breakfast out. Definitely worth the five stars, and I will be back often."}
