{"text":"The service at Baseline Sports Bar was exceptional. Amazing bartender! Great enviromment. I'm new to Tempe and it was a nice welcome to the area."}
{"text":"Right in my Neighborhood .   

I have  lived in tempe  for a while  now and tonight i just randomly   went to a bar to grab a bite with my co-worker, and i was pleasantly  surprised.  The Baseline  sports   bar, is a really   great   place to hang out an just chill. A really   relaxed and friendly   environment  great service. And really  great wings. Im not one who likes to hangout  at  a bar but this place is definitely   going  to  be  my new favorite  place to hangout with friends, also try the  the Whitney  Wings they are delicious ."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could! Disgusting flat Stella on draft and service was horrible. Waitresses would rather talk to each other in the back room than actually serve us. Someone should call bar rescue.  Oh wait... they already did and it still needs rescuing. If Jon Taffer came in he would be livid! What a waste of space. This bar will not last!!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to come for some beers and their food is pretty darn good! We usually come on Tuesdays because well, Shannon is working!! She is very attentive and always has a suggestion for a beverage if you aren't quite sure what you want. Fun, Outgoing and friendly!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here off and on for many years. Came back to check it out after the bar rescue. Looks like they never changed the menu at all, and the bathrooms are still gross. It's clearly a bar for regulars and they get served before anyone else. The room itself looks good (though anything was an improvement) but it's nothing special. 

Also, I know it's not a big deal, but stickers on the window indicate fresh made pretzels, and they do not appear on the (old) menu. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was great! Came for my friend's 21st, and Whitney was very personable. She went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. Also, drinks are made extremely well and service is prompt!"}
{"text":"Great local bar! Whether you're a biker or a sports fan, everyone gets together in harmony! The food is great ...and not just for a sports bar. Servers are smoking hot, and the owner is cool as hell! Plain and simple, they make you feel welcome and it's a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"I lived in the area for a while and finally decided to get a drink here with a friend. right when we walked in we were welcomed. we decided to sit at the bar and ordered drinks.I personally enjoy their selection of beer, the typical size selection for a dive bar. they had pool, dart shuffle board. they also have plenty of TV's if you want to enjoy the game. the food was awesome. it was cooked well and tasted awesome. The bar tender was nice and struck up conversation with us and all the others in the area. all in all, a great experience!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a buddy, 10 / 12 people were here. The food was good. I will definitely come back for the food. The service was very slow. We were here for sometime before anyone even came over for drink order. It seem like there was more bull shitting than work going on. I'll try again. Maybe just a bad day."}
{"text":"My friends and I come here a lot! Our waitress, Stacy, was really conversational and fun. The environment is more laid back and casual which is nice if you're just looking to hangout with your friends. Prices are pretty good and they have a good reverse happy hour. They have a few arcade-like games such as shuffleboard, pool, darts, etc. Drinks are made really well. Will continue to keep coming here."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!! Went there before bar rescue and it was dirty and not very inviting. Went after bar rescue and ordered a burger medium to medium rare .I was told it will be cooked however the cook wants. It was well done! So..we decided not to base our decision on one visit..went back and asked the waitress about any appetizers on happy hour and she says...you want cheap food you can always go to mcdonalds!!! We just figured she is stupid so we ordered burgers medium to medium rare and again...well done!!!! Asked for hot sauce and went to use it and it was foamy and chunky!!! Showed the waitress and she grabbed the bottle brought back a partial bottle of something else with no lid and crap stuck to the sides!!!!! Unbelievable! !! So sad because I live in the area and really was looking forward to this bar being nice. Would not recommend this to anyone!!!!! So sad."}
{"text":"Baseline sports bar is a great environment. Good prices on drinks plus friendly and attentive staff! Met some coworkers here and had a great time. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, great food and cheap drinks, staff is very friendly. Stopped by to try it out, cab not recommend it highly enough. Try the Whitney wings if you feel like having some awesome wings. The Jack Daniels burger is amazing. Buddy had the jalapeno pepper burger had him wanting some milk."}
{"text":"The good  :I went back to this place with a couple of friends that wanted to go there for a UFC fight.  They had printed new menus since the last time I had been, and I was not overcharged for anything on the bill.  My friends and I had a good time. 

The bad:  When I tasted the cole-slaw, it was off, like it had fermented.  \"my server brought me an alternate side dish which tasted ok.  When I get something that tastes off in a restaurant. I try to look up the health inspection history to see if there is a history of larger problems, and there were.  just search for \" Maricopa County restaurant ratings\", select the county web site from the results, and enter the name of the business on the county web page.  This place had five major violations, including a cooler holding food at 56 degrees, and a cook wiping his nose, and continuing to cook without washing his hands

Overall: It's a good time, but eat somewhere else"}
{"text":"I only pressed one star because i had too. They are negative zeros across the board. First of all it is full of biker guys being obnoxious and loud who are in their 40s and 50s trying to act 21. One of the guys wanted to throw around the N word like it was no big deal being a disgusting racist person. The bartender did not care at all and let him keep being a disgusting immature individual. No one cared to kick him out or calm him down. Encouraging him is more of the word I'm looking for. I will never go back to this dump low class establishment with horrible service, people and $2 tasting drinks. No one should ever go here unless you are a low class racists like the rest!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been in this place a bunch of times and I've always gotten a great meal!  It's one of those places where everybody is welcome from golf shirts to sports freaks to some leather and lace.  The owner AJ is a no nonsense kind of gal that has a good thing going here and my group of friends and coworkers like to hang here!  I LOVE the concept of Tuesday nights with some free dinner and SOA on the big screen!  For game days, there are like 1000 TV's and not a bad seat in the house.  We will be back again REALLY SOON!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday night with some friends. Our server brought us menus and took our order quick enough, but that's where it ended. Our drinks were empty for 10+ minutes but she never stopped to check in on us. It looked like they were short staffed so I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt, but she literally checked in on every other table but ours. 

I actually had to approach her at the bar in order to get my tab because I wasn't gonna waste another minute of my Friday night being ignored. We left and took our business elsewhere. This is the first one star review I've ever written for an establishment. I had high hopes for this place, but what a let down."}
{"text":"Baseline Sports Bar has delicious mozzarella sticks. Great customer service. Good music."}
{"text":"My team and I like to come down here for warm ups right before we let off some dingers at Kiwanis park. Maria takes great care of us every time. I typically get the Caesar salad which gives me the fuel to go all Kirk Gibson around the bases. Stop by next time you're in the neighborhood, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Amazing bartender, service was great. Beautiful people deserves beautiful reviews. Bartender is beautiful and really knew what she was doing."}
{"text":"It was my first time in tempe az and checked out this bar and I have traveled all over the world and I lived in nyc for 11 years and still living there is this bartneder named Whitney Wingfield she is by far the bartender I ever she is amazing and she has an amazing playlist ever! Come to this bar especially when she is working you will get the absolute best when it comes to bartending"}
{"text":"1st review here...  3 stars means \"a-ok\" and that what this place is.

Nothing fancy but at least the bar is clean and the wait staff is attentive.  If your looking for a local sports bar, this is the best with in walking distance of  mill/baseline.  

Lots of TVs in viewing range of most of the seats.  However, this place is lacking in the HD department.  Lots of older, fading, rear projection models do not make up for a few well placed HD panels IMO.  Good variety of channels showing.  They did not have the MLB package and its June so... not much else to watch.

Food was ok, maybe even a-ok.  The best appetizer has to be the fried mac n cheese bites.  Quesadillas not great, but after a few drinks they sure hit the spot.

Shuffle board and golden tee live available."}
{"text":"Great service. ..terrific food!  Whitney Wings are the best:) this is my new Sunday football spot! !!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Bar Rescue....twice....once for the original makeover and then the \"where are they now\" bit.  We checked it out before and  after the show had been there. The remodel was great and cleaned the place up alot. The service and the food was terrible. Looks like not even Jon Taffer could save this place."}
{"text":"We saw the episode of Bar Rescue and wanted to check this place out. Had never been in it before so we have nothing to compare its \"remodel\" to other than the pictures on Yelp. We also read the prior reviews so we went in totally unbiased. 
We went on a Saturday about 7pm and immediately found seating at the bar. Place wasnt very busy so the service was prompt and friendly. I ordered a Coors Light draft and wife asked about their cider beers and bartender said they only have one. Which is weird because on Bar Rescue they devised a specialty drink for them using a cider beer! It wasn't even offered or suggested. So, my Coors came and her only choice of a cider beer. The Coors didn't taste at all like Coors and when I pointed that out to the bartender she said others had said the same thing that day and that the lines must have been switched. Then why the hell keep serving it!! She replaced it with a Coors bottle. 
The bar was nice and they have a big picture of Taffer from Bar Rescue on the wall so they must have taken his advise on something. But couldn't tell on what or where. NO ONE was eating. The 3 or 4 local patrons at the end of the bar were definitely regulars otherwise I am sure that their loud, obnoxious four letter word shouts would not have tolerated. The female of the group was the most obnoxious. What a shame. Taffer wasted his time and money.
It was one drink and gone.
We wont be back."}
{"text":"This is a standard neighborhood bar that has been cleaned up. It's not the nicest place in town but it's not the worst either. The inside is actually pretty nice and there's a small patio that isn't bad either. The garlic fries are my favorite thing there."}
{"text":"Saw many negative reviews but as I was just in town for work I figured it couldn't hurt to drop in and check it out! Seated myself at the bar and was given service right away. Beer was cold and served in a clean glass. Big placard from Bar rescue on the wall, but I could tell the bartender was tired of being asked about it from her responses to other patrons.

Food came out quickly and was hot, no issues there either. I did not come during peak hours though, came on a weekday late afternoon.

Edited to bump up to four stars, the business made a good point; food/drink and service was very up to standard. I won't give a 5 star review on this business due to the bartender's attitude about questions regarding the establishment being on the TV show bar rescue. I'm sure they get more business due to the show, and assumed they would be more open to discussion about it."}
{"text":"Nice chill place. Bartenders are attentive and courteous. Good drinks, but they only served one type of tequila (Souza, I think? ) never seen that before. Good place to catch a football game and eat a snack. Would definitely go back. But please add other tequila brands to your bar."}
{"text":"Nice biker bar. Bars are nicely finished and drinks are inexpensive. Lined bartender is a nice and easy going gal. Nice for a dive bar"}
{"text":"What was once a great place to grab a bite and beer has gone down hill. It's sad because my friends and I used to flock here for the wings and other food items. Just has a different feel!"}
{"text":"Baseline sports bar, well its a nice bar with a huge screen to view sports and events.  Lately it has become a biker hangout but with class.  They have lots of cool events going on during the weekends like bike stunts, girls wrestling in a pool of noodles (whoo hoooo!) and Ive witnessed a few MMA matches going on outside with a cage set up.  Overall i think its a cool place. I havent had the chance to try alot on the menu. and ive only had a few pitchers of beer..    I may be back to try it out again.

I had the chance to go out again on Tuesday nights but just now had the chance to write a review.  WOW , free dinner and good food , plus a showing of Sons of Anarchy, whoa you cannot beat that with a stick.  The cook/chef comes out and announces his dishes, and boy every time ive gone its been Delicious and they have introduced my pallet to new foods. many are simple dishes made with a twist of Fabulous!  The bar itself is clean, full of cool people and again during the weekends its get loud , crazy and fun.  I dont drink anymore, but boy can I eat!  This place is definitely keeping up with being \"The best bar in Tempe\" and Im glad I keep going back.  The staff is great and any time my Dad comes in from California he always says, lets go to The Baseline Sports bar.  without a doubt he knows a good place once he recieves great customer service along with good food and beer.  Cheers."}
{"text":"One word is GROSS.  From the FILTHY menu that literally SMELLED like it was wiped with a filthy rag... and-of which we all had to share it  at our table as they didn't have enough for the place) to the over-sauced sandwich that I sent back and got a hockey puck hamburger instead... to the POOR service (girl didn't even come back to ask if everything was ok)  Save yourself and seek another sports bar.  The inattentive waitress also thought she could get away with charging my credit card an extra buck and I had already RELUCTANTLY  left 15%  !! Caught it reconciling my account so they even committed credit card fraud. I will NEVER be back to this dank and filthy place."}
{"text":"We really wanted to love Brick and Barley as we enjoy visiting bars that have been rescued. Unfortunately, 3 stars is the best I could do but this bar does have some good qualities. The inside is well laid out with pool tables and plenty of cool wood tables to choose from... the bar looks stellar.  The food is also great, surprising quality for \"bar food\".  We had a steak wrap and avocado BLT with fries. The cook Reggie is very friendly also.  He stopped by our table for a chat. A couple of things we didn't like.... the sound system is awesome but the music choice was disappointing. No filter on a Saturday afternoon with heavy F bombs and N word variety. Disappointing for us.. maybe someone else wouldn't care.  The bathrooms are definitely an issue with obvious disrepair to a sink, tile, vent and a stall door missing a handle that gives outsiders full view.  Really?!  Our order was also incorrectly put in which the waitress didn't own up to, instead blaming a computer glitch.  That was weak.  In her defense, the cook took care of it with a replacement to go.  Last thing, I ordered a beer from a local brewery.  I was originally told the tap was being changed and then the story changed after 10 minutes to \"we are all out.\"   That is another small thing that combined with the other issues knocks off a couple of stars.  This place could be great with some better attention to detail."}
{"text":"This place is not keen on customer service. When you walk in, it has the feel that the only people in there are the people that come in everyday. Everything is pretty standard as it relates to a sports-bar. Food was not bad not nothing special either. The service was slow, didn't know if they had a server for my area or even if they had areas. I have to walk up to the bar to ask for the check after waiting and my plate and beer were cleaned up. I was only asked for a drink once with no refills on the water."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. I came into town on a Sunday to grab a beer and ended up watching football all day, the bartenders knew everyone's name and the food was awesome, try the \"whitney wings\". I had such a fantastic time I came back later that week, and will be back the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"We went into this bar, honestly, just because we saw it on tv. How cool!!! We went for happy hour after work.  The bartender invited us to take a seat wherever we'd like and our server would've with us shortly. Our server, endearingly, Goldie Locks, was honestly one of the best servers we've had in Arizona. It's not easy to serve demanding customers- and we are :)  She was patient, attentive, and friendly. We got great food recommendations, too. Speaking of, the pretzels are fresh baked and served with a cheese sauce and real mustard that took me right back to Milwaukee. Jalapeño poppers were awesome. Pork sliders are no joke- go get some now! Slow roasted in the oven with some delicious spices. The BBQ sauce is subtle with a juicy burst of pork flavor and a deep heat. The new chef came out to greet us, too. Huge personality and passion for food. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ok, so is it 5 stars or 1 star? LOL. I kid-of course-with the aforementioned question referring to the disparity in ratings I see regarding this bar. Gotta love how people just go and post a one star review, when they probably shouldn't have gone in the first place. Do I go to a vegetarian restaurant, get upset, and then go on Yelp to rate the freakin' place 1 star because they wouldn't serve me a double angus steak burger? LOL. No, because one should not expect to get beefy sandwiches at such an establishment. Hahaha.

ANYWAAAAYS. So what is it people? Well I LOVE this place, so 5 stars. :-) I came in, feeling like crap, sitting by myself, and lo and behold-the owner of the place strikes up a conversation with me. Besides being very pleasant and friendly, she introduces me to some of the regulars at the bar, and proceeds to talk about the upcoming planned events for the night. I felt something that I haven't felt in a loooong time at a restaurant. Like I mattered. Like whoever was talking to me wasn't just playing a script. Like they were not moving me through a factory, and getting me out of the place and getting to the next customer was the desired output. 

On top of that, FREE FOOD. Yes. FREE FOOD. And yeah, I'm being grammatically incorrect, but SO WHAT. :-) lol. The freaking place gave samples of new dishes the chef's were trying out, and everybody in the place sat in there eating and talking like they were friends and family.

Was it perfect? No. Was it clean? Yes (surprisingly). This is just a good bar. A bar for drinking beer, listening to good rock and roll songs, watching sports, or just hanging out. If you come in expecting that, and not the Palace Of Versailles, then you will have a great time. :-)"}
{"text":"The place is clean the food is good and the wait staff and bartenders are very nice. No complaints. Lots of TVs if you're looking for that. Angie is very personable with everyone. I had the Philly cheesesteak and it was yummy. I'd come back here with friends."}
{"text":"Bartender was an ass to us the second we started interacting. Sorry I interrupted your football game, bro.

I generally try to give most places two chances but this one won't get a second.

The table server was nice and the pretzels were pretty good otherwise it would have been 1 star."}
{"text":"We placed an order through Amazon Restaurants. Two minutes before we should have received our order, Amazon text us, telling us that Brick & Barley, after several attempts, could not be reached. The funds for the order had already been removed from our account and now we have to wait for a refund. If they do not plan on fulfilling orders through sites they list with, they should take their information down. Total waste of an hour and and days waiting for our money to be returned."}
{"text":"This is a place night out for happy hour with nicely girls and wines! I was here a few times, but I liked a lot when hanging out with friends and have a good times! They have so nice waitresses and nicely customer services, the price is average, it wasn't too cheap or expensive, I definitely come back for more good tines!!! 
I truly recommend!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this local bar more stars :( 

We walked in around 7pm on a Friday night.. It took us over 10 minutes to be acknowledged or given a menu. The bright side is that our server acknowledged our wait and treated us to our first round (thank you- you're the reason there's 2 stars up there!!) Our server was blonde with dreds in a ponytail- she was very polite and tried to connect with us! However, she was one of 2 servers holding down about 14 tables in the small bar. We had mozzarella sticks that were closer to room temperature when we received them, but they were lightly battered, which I appreciate. I ordered a club sandwich and my husband had Whitney wings. He said they were pretty good, but we both agreed they can't touch Zipps Golden Medium (this bar offers honey hot wings, but our server politely warned me they are hot!) I had asked for avocado on my sandwich (I saw our server write it down!) There was no avocado on my sammich, though. It was a standard sandwich, not memorable although the ham and turkey were thick, fresh cuts. While the wait for a menu was long, the wait for the check was (is?) even longer. I've had time to write this whole review, hear the table next to us order drinks.... Receive drinks... Order dinner... I might just walk up to the bar to ask to pay. 

TL;DR: long waits, short staffed, mediocre food, kind servers, decent atmosphere- not worth the first round free and I STILL don't know whether we were charged for the avocado. :(. Sorry Whitney, I wish this could've been a good one.

Update: our server was genuine and apologetic - she deeply discounted our tab to make up for waits. We were charged for the avocado but she more than removed the $0.75 charge. I'm sorry I didn't catch your name, blonde server, but it's because you cared that we will give this place a shot again!"}
{"text":"Still alot of regular's at the bar and a decent crowd on Friday night. Bud Lights are only 3 bucks and bartenders were very nice on this visit. Good TV set outside and improved TV's at bar. Nachos looked crazy big, but I did not sample any food."}
{"text":"We had a happy hour event here for Admin professionals day and the service and food was great! Our waitress was covering most of the restaurant area and we were not waiting or wanting anything.  The chef came out to see how everything was going and that was a nice touch. AJ was very helpful in getting everything prearranged."}
{"text":"The owner is a hot mess. Very nice makes you feel welcome. The food is very good for a \"dive bar\" feel. Overall great for lunch or happy hr....."}
{"text":"Excellent food drink and service, a great neighborhood bar, this is a fun way energizing place did I mention really cold drinks and wow food, ya gotta try it... Cheers"}
{"text":"I really must take exception to a prior review.  This is bar food taken to a totally new level.  The menu is extensive, creative and has a great variety of choices.  The owner's commitment to good food and quirky sense of humor is evident throughout the menu.  He doesn't hesitate to give you his opinion on how food should be, telling us that there is never -- will never be -- a single bit of iceberg lettuce in his kitchen.

The quality of the food is probably the best I've ever had in a bar.  Everything is fresh and house-made.   Crunchy food comes out crunchy, hot is hot, and (take my word here) spicy is spicy!  

The atmosphere inside is jovial, with a good energy despite the darkened room (great for watching any of the many TVs!).  The patio has misters and several tables, for dining outside or smoking.  The regulars are friendly, normal folks who like good food while they watch the game.

The staff is one of the friendliest groups ever, easy on the eyes, certainly, but I don't consider a scoop-neck t-shirt to be hoochie in the least.  

Nice people, good food, great atmosphere.  I'm not exactly a regular, but my husband and I go probably a couple times a month."}
{"text":"Love this little gem!   Cold beer good food and a great neighborhood feel.  Shannon is the best bartender I have ever had....but everyone is very nice.   May be my new favorite place to go!!!"}
{"text":"Not wheelchair accessible!!! My uncle and I like it here but we had to stop going because he has a hard time getting in and out of the bathroom:/ Would be nice to add a grab bar for wheelchair peeps. If you do add handy cap  bars , let us know and we'll be back !! :/"}
{"text":"Wings!! If you are a grilled wing lover I definitely recommend coming here. Their sweet tai chile wings with garlic are to die for. Came in just to get a drink after work and got talked into ordering wings from Susie q. Washed it down with an ice cold kilt lifter. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place!
I don't work too close to here but I can usually get in and out really quick on my lunch break. Cali-club sandwich is my favorite, and they also have a pretty good beer selection. Prices are right, bartenders are hot. 
My kind of place ;-)"}
{"text":"the last few times i have been here the service has dropped a lot.  if you are not at the bar it can next to impossible to get service...even when it is slow.  a couple of us waited at a table for nearly 20 minutes to put in a drink order.  once we got the drinks we tried to put an order in for some grub. our server said she would be right back to take our order but never returned.  i walked up to the bar so i could just pay cash for the drinks but the bartender sent us back to our table.  she said it was the servers responsibility. keep in mind there was only one other group seated at the tables.  maybe instead of sitting with that table..just hanging out.....you should make sure your other tables are doing ok.
anyways..i still like the patio and the fact that i can bring my dog.  they do have some awesome drink specials but the service is far from good. instead of going here 3-4 times a week i now come here maybe once every other month."}
{"text":"Well honestly this place for me gets 4 stars. The servers were nice and helpful. We ordered pretzel bread, spicy quesadillas and rosemary fries.. All of that food was great. And it was served to our table/area quick. The draft beer was nice and cold with a good amount of foam.
When we first walked into the bar the atmosphere is very relaxing and welcoming. They had a draft system and a bottled beer which is cool. Our bartender was Diva and she was great! She made sure to get to us quickly and with a smile on her face. So I felt welcomed. 

The only reason why I could not give a 5th star is because there was no Moscow Mules or Mojitos.. But the margarita was good!. 

**Just found out what they are made with! Dork mode so edited."}
{"text":"Great fun! Great selection of music! Whitney was very nice! Wow! The food is very tasty for bar food. The place is clean. They offer a great menu until very late hours. Good time!"}
{"text":"Quick update on a previous review that I did.

I went back here two nights ago, right after I wrote my original review.  I wanted to see if the place had changed.

It turns out that I had a decent time.  The bartender knew exactly what I wanted, and the food options that I saw were not too bad.  Now, it still was a little bit dirty, so I'm only going to give this a three stars.  It certainly does it's job if you are looking for a drink."}
{"text":"When we lived in Arizona, we came to this bar frequently during football season (as we are Eagles fans and needed to watch them somewhere with a satellite).  The food is pretty standard bar food, but there were lots of TVs, both indoors and outdoors.  They have the waitresses all hooched out, but we always received fantastic service.  Food is not overly memorable, but I did like:

Cajun Chicken Salad ($7.25) - Just like it sounds, and I would get the fat-free tomato basil dressing.

The Big Club ($7.25) - With fries.  Pretty good club."}
{"text":"The Wings were awesome.  Whitney Wings are the best here.  They're tasty with a bit of a kick.  Come ready to eat because they're generous.  They have great hours and they're open on most holidays."}
{"text":"Ehhhhh. 

My boyfriend and I met up with a buddy for happy hour last Friday. He got there first and said he already ordered a beer and some wings. When I asked what flavor wings, he had no idea because he wasn't given any options. He asked for wings and she said OK and walked away and he was left to wonder what he's about to get. 
After she came over to take our drink order, I was left to ask the guys if she spoke any English because she couldn't seem to understand us nor did she actually say more than one word at a time. 

It was horrible service!!

When I checked in on Yelp, I was given a coupon for a free drink. So when I tried presenting it to her when we asked for the checks she had no idea what it said, so I explained it and that was like talking to wall. 

The wings were tasty, but had no sauce. Do you offer sauce??

The beers were cheap, but it was like pulling teeth to order one. 

I can't think of a good reason to stop in again."}
{"text":"I came here to check out Bar Rescue renovation. We walked in at was not acknowledge by the 2 waitress that walked right in front of us. We found an empty table. Well after 10 minutes our waitress took our drink order. She was nice. She was busy and with only 2 waitress i know why. My beer was warm. Paid 4.95 for warm beer.The glass waa colder than the beer. I ordered wings and it took 20 minutes."}
{"text":"This bar is not up to the Bar Rescue standards. 
My wife and I walked in and waited 6 minutes and the bartenders never even an acknowledged that we were there. 
8 minutes later we walked out and the bartenders never bothered  to make an attempt to talk to us. 
EPIC  FAIL."}
{"text":"Spinich salad was skimpy on the Chicken. 
Nice atmosphere and good selection of beers though. Staff is nice. AJ. More Chicken please."}
{"text":"The recent upgrades have really turned it into something special. The old and new staff are some if the best that there is. The clientele is diverse and loyal. This place is a true gem. Great menu and service. An extremely good value for your money."}
{"text":"Curiosity was killing us so we had to see what John Taffer did to BSB.
Not much.
It's brighter inside, not so dark and gloomy, but really the same exact place.
A few new tables, same bar layout.
Didn't try any food, but the beer out of the tap was warm. I love goose island beer, and when I took that first sip, ehhhh.......ruins it."}
{"text":"Great service, great prices, and food is super fresh!  Nachos are some of the best we've had.  Buffalo Chicken wrap and spicy chicken quesadillas are also great.  Discounts for team sports, too!  Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Favorite neighborhood bar. We make a point to go on Tuesdays because that's when our favorite bartender, Shannon, is working! Her outgoing personality and expert shot making skills always make our night so much better! Love her!"}
{"text":"I know it was after lunch on a Sunday, but I was totally not impressed with this place.  You have to know something is wrong when everyone is sitting at the bar and stares at you while you walk in.  No one greeted us and we figured right then and there not a good place for lunch.  Bad service is sooo not cool."}
{"text":"Came here to have dinner but red flags started as soon as we hit the door.  Service was some of the worse I have ever had. It wasn't the fault of the waitress, you can tell management is not doing their jobs training staff and keeping up with the place.  There were center peices stacked up in the corner where they should have been out. PAtrons had to call over the staff who seemed to enjoy being behind the bar more than attending to customers.  It you are known, you seemed to have gotten service alot faster.  We were never even asked if we wanted a menu.

Drank our beer, and skipped the meal and left. Went somewhere else to eat.  Place has a lot going for it, it should be a winner instead of a dude.  Beware."}
{"text":"Would be the best dive bar in tempe if Doc and Eddy's wasn't around (and walking/crawling distance from my place). Most nights baseline is pretty empty and a great place for a few drinks and laughs with friends without too many other people around. On fight night though get here at least 45min early as the place gets packed and even though they have tons of tv's the layout isn't the best for a huge crowd.

I have to say as far as bar food goes this place is up near the top with the chicken parm melt being something that I actually will have a craving for once in awhile. The only food that isn't up to par is the Queso as it is just nacho cheese with chopped tomato and jalepeno. 

As for drinks I have never really had a problem with anything the one time my buddy and i did get one slightly weak we walked up to Eva the bartender and asked for it stiffer-MISTAKE- but in the best way possible as she loaded up the captain in our captain and cokes and did so till i had to ask her to stop so that I could get over my sea legs. Otherwise the drinks are decently priced(even rounds of shots and bombers) and well mixed.

On nights when it's time to just hang out in a more sedate bar and have a good conversation and maybe a bite to eat this is the place for me."}
{"text":"I would like to start this review off by saying that I am NOT a biker.=)

I have been going to Baseline Sports Bar regularly for about three years now.  Since the first day I stepped foot into the bar, I felt at home, welcomed, and appreciated as a customer.  Baseline is a locally owned bar, and the owner is a woman.  I think that's pretty awesome!  Even better, every Tuesday night, she hosts a free dinner in the evening and shows Sons of Anarchy.  What could be better than a bar that feeds me for free!?  

Additionally, for a sports bar, the food is actually really good!  The place is pretty informal, so you may have to holler at a bartender to get their attention.  Don't be shy!  The bartenders are all really awesome and will chitchat with you or leave you be if you're not in the mood for conversation.  I've seen sports lovers (of course), business people working on their laptops, bikers, old people, young people, families...  The diversity in the crowd at Baseline is something else that I really love about the place!  

I hope you will give this place a try.  I really love this bar!"}
{"text":"Baseline Sports Bar went through a recent renovation since being featured on the show \"Bar Rescue\" and has since renamed itself \"Brick & Barley\".

This is a nice bar and grill with a decent menu and fairly priced drinks.  I had the Reuben and it was done nicely.  The fries were also tasty.  The decor is comfortable with lots of dark woods and brick facade.  There is a pool table and shuffleboard to play.

I will be back for a drink and a bite soon.  Check them out."}
{"text":"First clue: afternoon of the Final Four and this sports bar wasn't crowded. 

Second clue: in a group of 9 at least 3 people were asked for their drink orders multiple times. They ordered water. 

Forty-five minutes after arriving one of our group still hadn't received his food. Almost everyone else was done. He ordered a salad. 

Our waitress had disappeared by now.  So one of our group got up and found another waitress and got the salad.  30 minutes later, when it was time to pay, we saw the waitress had exercised her menu-mentioned discretion to charge a 20% gratuity.  Probably (and accurately) sensing she had no chance of making that much on her merits.

There's nothing special about this sports bar unless you consider slow service and the usage of buffalo sauce to make things spicy as special.  The TVs are old, none were on a HD feed, the service was lousy, the food was bad and overpriced.  Money is better spent just a few doors down at My Big Fat Greek Express."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. After seeing them on bar rescue we came in on a Saturday. One bartender serving as well. We basically had to chase her down to get her to take our order. The food came and one burger was burnt black and the steak chimi was sliced dried up steak with no flavor. The only good thing in our meal was the fries. We asked about the black burger and the server said that's the way the owner likes it so the cook will not cook the burger to any other temperature. She also was rather rude and more upset that we complained. She gave us a menu to choose something else but has been back at the bar for 10 minutes without asking what else we wanted. I just can't believe the service and quality of food that I have experienced here. Definitely do not recommend this place AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!  Update* Here is the best part, after being ignored for 10 minutes and the one server making awkward eye contact with us while waiting to pay for our bill my fiancé decided to walk up to the bar to pay our bull and come to find out this waitress/bartender is picking her fantasy football players with a group of customers at the bar! Really?!??? You're kidding right? An absolute horrific experience! There are many other places to spend your money in Tempe do NOT let this place be one of them!"}
{"text":"I have worked in the service industry for a good majority of my life and I have never been more frustrated with service received, or lack thereof. I know when there are big events taking place (like a ufc fight) service may take a bit longer, but waiting almost 2 hours for an order of hot wings is more than just a bit ridiculous. To top it off, knowing that it was a busy night, there was only one server on staff that evening! Either be prepared and come to visit already eaten, or give up hope that you will receive any decent service. The \"pitcher's\" that were ordered, only contained barely 2 small cups worth of beer in them...I would at least expect to be compensated for the lack of product received from what was ordered. We will never be returning to this establishment unless or until they get their act together."}
{"text":"I don't get the hate for B&B. It's clean, it's quiet, the drinks and food are great and the service is always fast and friendly. I've never seen Whitney fail to greet everyone who walks in or anyone be ignored by the wait staff, whether it's a Tuesday afternoon or Friday night. B&B is by far my favorite local hangout."}
{"text":"It doesn't appear that you can leave no stars, but if you could, I would! I'm doing this review from the parking lot after walking out from having one single drink. It took an hour... an hour(!) to get a single cocktail at the bar, pay with cash, and get change. Shift change during happy hour and the place comes to a complete halt? That my friends is bull$h!t. Don't come here... just don't.

[UPDATE] When I posted my original review,  I was surprised to get a reply from Whitney, the manager. She said she appreciated my advice, they were making my adjustments to their shift change, and that the day I was there a big UFC event was going on, so it wasn't the normal happy hour crowd. She hoped I would take a chance on going there again sometime. Well, I told her I would give it another shot, and because I'm fair, I would update my review afterwards.

Soooo... I went back for lunch with about 7 coworkers. We more than doubled the customer count at that time, so they were not very busy. Our server was a very nice and very attentive young lady. Everyone ordered food and beverages and I ordered the Nachos, because they were at the top of the menu and listed as the house specialty. The food was very slow coming out of the kitchen, and I didn't even get my nachos until after everyone else was done eating and about ready to leave. They were okay, nothing to write home about, but very late. So my colleagues got to watch me eat a plate of nachos, and I got to follow through with my promise to Whitney."}
{"text":"Food was VERY good (Cod Sliders, curly garlic fries), service was good (cheerful and efficient), menu had a good variety.  It had a nice menu I would expect in a better looking bar... Though the place was clean it still was an old bar in terms of feel and furnishings.  One great feature was the huge projector screen - football up close and personal!"}
{"text":"This is easily the BEST SPORTS BAR in the Tempe area. Yes, it's dark. Yes, it's a bit of a dive, but the servers are fantastic, Brittany in particular. And the wings. THE WINGS. Not to mention the very reasonable prices. You won't be disappointed. Lived here for the last 6 months, spent the first 2 months trying to find a place to watch football. THIS is your spot."}
{"text":"My wife and I had to grab some quick dinner before an evening engagement. Never seen this place before, so we thought we'd stop by and see how it is. Not a horrible place. It's definitely more of a dive bar than a sports bar. The service was slow, cheerful and smiling, but slow. The food was very so-so. My wife liked her reuben, but the steak quesadilla was pretty much just philly cheesesteak in a tortilla. Decent prices. But, I don't foresee us coming back."}
{"text":"This place just keeps going down hill. Stopped by to have some drinks and play some shuffleboard and the place was dead. This has always seemed to be the case except during football games when the place fills up a bit. The night we were there they were out of A lot of things behind the bar. Even Jack and that is never a good sign. The food we ordered could have come out better as well. We ordered chicken tenders that were small rubbery and lacked a resemblance to real meat. 
You can find better places in Tempe I am sure."}
{"text":"Went there around midnight on a Saturday night (10/09/10).  There was a group of about 6-7 college guys hanging out in the corner, balancing drinks on their friends head who was asleep on the table.  Other than them, the bar was completely empty.
The guy behind the bar was either helping himself to all the booze he could drink all night or needs to be drug tested.  He was a complete jerk and seemed like he was on something.  There were no other staff that I saw.  
A group of girls came in about 30 mins after us and instead of sitting at the bar, they sat at a table.  Instead of going up to their table to take their orders, the bartender just yelled across the room and asked what they wanted.  
If you are looking for a low key dive bar I guess this would be your kinda place.  They do have a shuffle board table which was fun.  But this is very much not a social scene hangout."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great music and good location. We like to meet here and watch sports on the many TVs. The staff is great and super attentive."}
{"text":"We were there on a Saturday after two. The bartender was friendly and quick to get us a beer. However, the interior was dark and the music loud. Didn't think we would enjoy eating there. So, we drank and left."}
{"text":"I'm a sports bar regular, particularly during football season, and am not super picky about ambience, but this place needs a serious facelift.

My wife and I visited Baseline twice recently, and while it's a great place to catch a game, it's not going to be a regular stop. The food is quite good for a sports bar, but the look of the place is old and in need of repair.  

Details:  Stick with traditional bar food if you're going to eat here.  I generally go with wings and burgers in this kind of place, and found both to be excellent.  My wife, however, is a more adventurous diner, and tried the Thai chicken wrap which was more soup than solid food, and not much taste, either.  The spicy quesadilla she tried was too spicy for her to get down, though that may be a matter of individual taste.  Prices were average, and the size of the servings is adequate.

Service was friendly and efficient;  servers are very nice and attentive.

The biggest problem is the overall appearance of the bar.  It's poorly lit (not unusual for a sports bar, but this was darker than most bars), which is probably an advantage, because the place looks, well, OLD.  Definitely in need of a makeover, it looks like it hasn't been updated since 1985.  Both bathrooms are well-worn, and while not disgusting, they need a complete upgrade.  The \"patio\", small and primarily for smokers, has worn out furniture and umbrellas.  

Plenty of TV screens for sports, and we were pleasantly surprised when the server actually knew how to change a channel on the satellite TV.  This seems to be rare in local sports bars.  

Bottom line is the Baseline is toward the bottom of the scale among some much better alternatives in this neighborhood.  A \"Bar Rescue\"-type makeover is sorely needed.  Otherwise, food's fine and the service is above average. If the ambience were to be improved, this place would probably be packed.  As it is, it's a little above the level of a biker bar."}
{"text":"Dude this place is the shit! The fastest way to ruin your business is to mix \"scary bikers\" with sports bar patrons. Guess what? Everyone just wants to have a good time and a couple cocktails. I have been coming here for over 2 years and I yet to see any type of confrontation. From coming here every Tuesday, where they feed you for free while featuring the show \"Sons of Anarchy\" theater style. (The owner rides a motorcylce after all, that's where \"Represent MotherFucker\" came from I'm told) Even coming here Sundays for football! It's a lot of fun and the best thing about it is Baseline Sportsbar is a family owned and operated bar. The girls are really cool, and each have their own style. Don't be a dick or a douche and you will have a great time here! Support local, small businesses who support the community. 

P.S. My phone died while I was writing this review and not knowing, out of nowhere, the bartender \" Jillian\" I think, asked what type of phone I had and offered me a charger....that's service!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this bar. Reasonable prices, a great reverse happy hour, and fantastic service. Shout out to the bartenders Shannon & Whitney for keeping our drinks filled - fantastic service and DELICIOUS food."}
{"text":"Kind of dive-y, low key place to hang out with friends or watch a game. There are several TVs, shuffleboard and pool tables, and lots of big tables. The beer selection is great, and the green chile quesadilla is pretty good. I thought the fries could have been bigger and crispier, but maybe that's just my bias. I didn't see this until after I ordered my beer, but apparently if you get a quesadilla you can get a Mexican beer for $2.50! They also have a few cocktails on the menu."}
{"text":"1st visit to this bar. Beer selection was ok, nothing special, a couple crafts, nothing exceptional. Service was on the very poor side, plus the place wasn't busy or packed with patrons. Very sad, could have been more business like."}
{"text":"Ordered a club sandwich and Philly cheese steak. Absolutely terrible food. The club sandwich had one slice of turkey (which was low quality) and one slice of ham (again super low quality) and the bacon was almost no where to be found. It was basically a bread sandwich. Same with the Philly steak, very low quality and I didn't even eat half of the bread. I found out that this place has been on Bar Rescue, this place still needs rescuing. Especially in the food department. If I could rate this place 0 out of 5 I would."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and I cant tell you how blessed I am to be so close to this wonferful sports bar. Service has always been incredible. They always have the games on. The food is way better than just standard bar food. I will always come back to this place on Sundays"}
{"text":"Every time I have been here the food has been amazing and fast and including the service. I feel like this is my new home when I wanna get away from the world. All of these ladies have always made me feel at home at here \"Patty\" is my absolute favorite! Down to earth and friendly. Everyone here is attentive and you never feel ignored or feel like and outsider I LOVE THIS PLACE AND ITS EMPLOYEES! Whitney,Suzy,Jeff, Rachel make this place make you feel like you're welcomed! Try their garlic hot wings or their very special key lime dessert!!"}
{"text":"After hearing about them on Bar Rescue I went in with a friend to eat and play some pool. We played 40 minutes of pool and never once did the waitress come get our order. We ended up going to the bar for drinks and had to ask the waitress for a menu. She proceeded to throw it at us and never came to get our order. 

I will never patronize this establishment or recommend it to anyone. Beware the waitress with the black and white pants, even after confronting her about her service she just laughed. Horrible."}
{"text":"Decent looking place but the bartender Chuck was the biggest asshole i have ever met! He was extremely rude and obviously hated life and his job and took it out on everyone there. Never coming back unless he gets fired!"}
{"text":"Working so close to this place is a blessing and a curse.  The service can be slow during lunch, but the food is worth it.  Great burgers and even better fries.  Drinks are not expensive and they don't hold back on the alcohol in the mixed drinks."}
{"text":"I am definitely coming back.  Awesome food,  great tv setup,  and cold delicious beer! ! Stop in  and see your favorite team kick butt."}
{"text":"Service, food, and beer selection are always top-notch! Whitney Wings are the best wings I've ever had and the atmosphere is cool, fun, and always a good time!"}
{"text":"Came here because he had met here for lunch with clients and said he had some tasty barbecue sliders and part of the conversation was that this business was part of a program called \"Bar Rescue\" so I agreed we might as well check it out.
Quieter than anticipated for a Saturday night.
Limited menu but the selections are a bit creative for a bar.
I don't know what it was like here prior to the renovation/revamp.
Well lit, nice looking bar area.
There were a few high tops and picnic tables with benches instead of your basic dining table.  Added a nice touch.
Came here for a late dinner and although it was slow to get service our server was very polite, helpful and informative.  My husband ordered a Margarita and I was encouraged to have a taste before I ordered one for myself since they didn't have Grand Marnier necessary to make it a Cadillac.  It was alright but I opted to go with a basic mixed drink since I felt their microbrew selection was limited.
I had the Chicken Fingers and he had the Thai Chicken Wrap.  
Chicken Fingers were heavily battered and crispy.  They were okay but I was more in the mood for lightly battered tenderloins.  My fault for not inquiring.  
Thai Chicken Wrap looked yummy and sloppy juicy.  Seems he couldn't eat a portion without wearing some of it.
I would say the service was probably the best part about our visit here.
Food was okay, drink selection was okay, but neither are going to draw me back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Baseline Sports bar is not a bad place to hang out. I've been there twice and would probably go there again, but with the following expectations in mind:

** A friend and I have been mislead on the price of pitchers twice now and ended up with a bill twice as much as what we were expecting
** Service can be slow and I've experienced some forgetful staff

On the plus side though the place is very clean and well kept. Additionally, they have some good bar food. It's also a great place to watch a football game or an MMA fight."}
{"text":"It's called brick and barley now...2 stars for the service from the bartender. She just had a bad attitude and zero sense of urgency which comes off as lazy and uninterested in her job or customers."}
{"text":"First of all, i love the owner of this bar and the bar itself. It was the second bar i ever drank at.... I had a few bad experiences, especially because whitney was our favorite and we never saw her. Another absolutely amazing bar tender who is now one of my favorites up there with whitney is brittney(: they make this bar worth going to. I hated the new menu they had for food and drinks but before the menu change, their food was amazing! Me, my roommate and boyfriend will continue to go to this bar as long as all the same staff stay around."}
{"text":"Fun bar that was willing to put on a soccer game for me, despite NBA playoffs being on. The food is really good, especially for a sports bar. Order the buffalo chicken wrap, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a shit hole; it was one before they put lipstick on the pig and it is one now. After vowing not to come back in Baseline crap hole a couple of years ago due to horrible service and mediocre food, not to mention barfly midday drunks that call this place home evidently. Noticed a name  change and decided to give this \"new\" place a shot. Walked into a basically dead environment with a couple of deadbeat drunks at the bar.  Seat yourself, grabbed menu from adjoining table to notice it said Baseline crap hole on front...nothing changed, how cheap and typical of this place.  Sat and watched what I suppose was a female \"bartender\" only focused on the couple of drinks at the bar. Over 10 minutes went by with no acknowledgement, so left this outhouse and will never return.  Caught the tail end of Bar Rescue tonight and after seeing what I guess is the owner, I learned all I need to know.  This place will be out of business hopefully before football season can try to save it."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what there are so many negative reviews. Our waitress (which I believe is the owner's daughter who was on Bar Rescue) was extremely nice and tentative. We were told to seat ourselves and waited no time for her to come up and ask for our drinks. I got the buffalo wrap with garlic fries and my s/o got the Jack Daniel's burger with rosemary fries. Both were great! Beers are super cold and perfect temperature (thanks Taffer). It's also a dog friendly patio which is an added bonus! Jon Taffer did a great job transforming this place, and it looks like the owners and staff have maintained it well. We will defiantly be coming back here for some good beers, good grub, and good service!"}
{"text":"So far, it's up there with the best bar food. Buffalo Wing Quesadilla, burgers, onion rings..GREAT! I guess it first stood out because of their \"not so typical\" bar food...SALAD. My husband kinda wears me out on bar food, so sometimes I venture and try the salads. This didn't disappoint because it's real lettuce, not iceberg, and the dressings are incredible. 
Haven't run into a good drink special yet..but it's a good laid back place for a group hooking up after a game or something. Fight Nights and big game nights are packed so get there early. 
It's been changing lately though...really dim lights and not enough servers on the average night."}
{"text":"Have been in a few times here and there, nice local bar.  I finally had some food and Reggie(chef/cook) did not disappoint!! Great Jalapeño Burger!!! Service was great from Susie and Whitney!! Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I stopped by on a whim to grab a beer and work on some homework. The server was attentive, but still gave me the space I needed to work. This place has a great vibe and everyone was super friendly. Pool tables, shuffleboard, lots of tvs, and the food is great. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Baseline Sports bar is now a newly renovated bar called Brick and Barley. My husband and I have been here a few times. Today we were here to grab lunch and a hopefully a couple of beers. 

The bartender saw us walk in and we sat at the table for over 15 minutes, even the bartender walked in the back to get something and walked back to the bar. Never acknowledged us coming in or while we were sitting at the table waiting. After this we left. Just a few people in the place and wasn't too busy, it's unfortunate because we are down the street from here and have liked it in the past."}
{"text":"Use to love this bar. Bar Rescue ruined it. Looks like a 4 star place you would take a hot date while you watch sports instead of paying attention to your date."}
{"text":"Waited about 20 min and couldn't even get a servers attention to order a drink. Ended walking out and took our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great lil sports / dive bar in Tempe. Great bar food . lots of room . and Joe the bartender is awesome . this place is low key but would surprise you with how friendly the crowd is and you always get good service . even do industry nights now on Mondays for other servers and bartenders ."}
{"text":"Had such an amazing time with so many ladies service was phenomenal and the food and drinks are amazing so glad we fount this locally owned by women bar #femalefriendly"}
{"text":"This place went from being a decent sports bar to a place where bikers hang out. The management has adapted to the new crowd and changed their bar slogan to \"Represent Mother F****\" 

Not a great place, feels more like a private club you're waking into that you weren't invited to. 

Shame for what used to be a nice neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Bar Rescue reminded me to review. Had the exact experience other reviewers mentioned. Took forever for the food, and our server seemed like she just rolled out of bed and was hung over. She was super rude, pretty much rolling her eyes. We shared the pretzel, was going to stay longer, but was indeed uncomfortable. So we ended up going to Lucky Break down the street. 

**I can't believe the owner said she didn't want Christian sorority girls business. She'd rather have the male neighborhood drunks? They should hire a guy or two for up front, and make it someplace that a couple might actually want to go on a date. Even then I don't see a reason to ever go back, especially with so many other bars close by. She doesn't seem to want the business anyway."}
{"text":"Well we've been sitting here for over and hour with no drinks. Would leave if it weren't a fight night and impossible to find a seat at another bar. The nachos we had weren't fully cooked with raw unmelted cheese underneath. Not to mention there is someone in our section (inside) smoking, which I'm pretty sure is illegal, but we have no server or security to complain to. Good times...not so much."}
{"text":"Cool place the pretzels are on point love the combo of cheese and mustard dipping sauces!! i would like to see them upgrade the golden tee to a newer version and bigger screen would be so awesome!!"}
{"text":"I've known Diva for years, I enjoy the food no complaints here we host things for the Maricopa County Chamber too"}
{"text":"I ordered off of GrubHub and while the delivery time was fine, the product was disgusting. My boyfriend got the jalapeno popper burger and I got the Jack Daniel's burger. Both burger patties were dry and burned to the point that the char taste overpowered the other flavors. The burgers were literally inedible. I don't mean we ate it all then complained about it online. I mean the burgers are in the trash after a couple bites. Both burgers sounded amazing and we were excited to try this place - what an utter let down. Plus I got the garlic fries and it was literally a tablespoon of minced garlic dumped on top of some mushy fries and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese. I've never seen a place that didn't toss the fries in whatever flavoring so that it was evenly distributed, that lump of garlic was disgusting even when I tried to mix it up."}
{"text":"Nothing special.. Never impressed when the waitress/bartender comes out wearing flip flops. Umm, pretty sure that's a health code violation! Yuck. But just had to check it out since it was featured on Bar Rescue. Looks like a bad flip. Still smells bad like the old place and you can see where too many corners were cut during the makeshift renovation (electrical outlets not screwed into the wall, uneven flooring,  dirty ceiling was just painted over, etc..). I did love their dark wood tables & black chairs. Those looked sharp! Food was underwhelming at best. Service was on the slow side (only one waitstaff for the dining room and bar) but we weren't in a hurry. Ordered a chicken sandwich which was mostly bread, the small grilled chicken breast should have been served on a smaller roll as it was about 1/2 the size of the basic store bought burger bun. The side salad had a few bright green, yummy looking pieces of salad on top covering slimy/old/frozen lettuce. Bummed about the deceiving placement of the top pieces! They keep their \"condiment six pack\" in the fridge so the salt was clumped from the moisture and wouldn't come out of the shaker. Overall it filled the void but definitely wouldn't be a destination place for lunch."}
{"text":"Yes, I totally organized a small happy hour here a few weeks ago due to my fascination with Bar Rescue. 
Love love love what Taffer & co did with the place and how the ladies have kept it up since then! I called a few hours ahead and asked if I could make a reservation for a group of roughly 10 people. The girl on the phone was absolutely elated that I wanted to make a reservation because it was a Monday, and they were expecting it to be dead. So I made it and was told to let the hostess know once I arrived, and they would take care of me and my friends. And that is what we experienced! 

Honestly, it reminded me of a really cool British bar that I frequented when I studied abroad in the UK. Loved all the wood and the general decor. They have a lot of TVs with a lot of sports on, perfect! The menu is pretty much the same since Taffer redid it, and they feature a really delish cactus-mule drink that he created and a lot of us enjoyed! They also have a pretty decent rotating menu of local beers. I know a lot of my friends enjoyed their food, my wings were good, but just a little too spicy for my preference. Won't hold that against them since I didn't ask to taste the sauces before ordering. 

This is like the perfect watering hole for me and my friends, and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Very slow service, but friendly. They kept apologizing for the slow service and blamed it in on the big game. However...we got there an hour before the game when the place was only half full and it took 15 minutes just to get a beer. It wasn't even busy yet. The food took twice as long, again...it wasn't busy yet.  Just imagine how long it took once they filled up the place.  The food is your average bar food, decently edible.  There were a lot of TVs...so that's good...since its a sports bar.  I would probably not go here again. There are many better sports bars within a few miles of this place."}
{"text":"If you are not a regular do NOT go here. Service sucked. I mean was just terrible. I first ordered nachos and they came out wrong.  They had to redo them and then the cheese was not melted... I next ordered garlic fries that took 20 minutes and they came out cold.  The chef did come out and did more service then my waitress."}
{"text":"Asked for a medium burger today An got a hickey puck for a burger an she said this is the only way we make them here An stomped off. Had to get up go to the bar where she was standing an picking her Fantasy football team with another customer just to pay my bill to leave will never be going back to this place ever again. Zero stars."}
{"text":"There is 1 server on football Sunday, the server is also the bar back. There is currently 30-40 people at tables and the bar that the server is having to take care of. They ran out of clean glasses and they have to reuse the glasses we have when giving us a new beer. This bar adervisties they were on Bar Rescue. Well this bar needs to be Re-Bar Rescued."}
{"text":"I live down the street and I have been wanting to go to this bar. I am a huge diamondback fan and wanted to go inside to watch the game. It had the feel of a baker bar witch are regulars. Took a while to get any service. The bartender was ver rude. She gave us a dirty menu and never came back to take our order. We were watching the game then the tv went out. I would not go back."}
{"text":"The Good: They advertise free Wi-Fi and once you can track down the password, it performs admirably. And the bartender was very helpful in getting me online.

The Bad: The Thai Chicken Wrap was neither Thai nor Chicken.

The Ugly: Too much Dave Matthews. Update your juke, brah!

Baseline Sports Bar gets 3 stars because it is what it is and pretends to be nothing more. If you want a sandwich and a pint after the softball game you could do a heckuva lot worse."}
{"text":"Food was great! Until I saw the large German Shepard in the kitchen area.... the service was also great. But not sure if it's legal to have your pets in your place of work."}
{"text":"The bartender with black hair stares us down any time we come in. Makes us feel extremely unwelcome. Our first time here myself and one of my friends had just turned 21 and hadn't had our new ID's so they didn't allow us to drink which was fine. But as our other friends ordered drinks she continuously told them that we better not be taking sips and being sneaky. Basically treating us like children. My boyfriend is a fan of the draft choices. The biggest improvement needed is the location of the pool tables. It's hard to hit or shoot the balls at a good angle without hitting the wall or bumping into the wall separating them from the seating area. It would be a smarter choice to have the pool tables in the middle and move the tables to where the pool tables are now. Heard this place was on bar rescue but looks like it did the opposite of that. We miss the bronco decor!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly bartender. Made food and drink suggestions and was fantastically personable. I am getting the food to go and have not even tasted it yet, but her service thus far already won me over. I'll be back next time I travel to the area."}
{"text":"This is the worst food I have ever had... and I eaten shitty cuisine.... this place Service sucks, beer taste like cold piss, nacho had a dry meat loaf like meat on them... who can ruins quesadillas? ... this place.... plates where dirty, Waitress was slow and the restroom where so dirty no paper towels ... and graffiti everywhere not visiting again... #disappointed"}
{"text":"I added a star because Brick and Barley has had draft beer in stock more consistently. The staff and patrons are great."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of pretzels, so that's what drew me in. They are DELISH. Buttery, salty, soft, warm. I've had other food here as well and it's also really tasty. This place has a cozy neighborhood feel and I love the bench seating - reminds me of a German style pub. There are pool tables and shuffleboard, so I would recommend this place for a small group. Usually there is only one waiter and one bar tender on off hours, so don't expect to be constantly check on. The mixed drinks are pretty good and they have a great selection of beers. It's a great neighborhood bar!"}
