{"text":"Like most Veg-o's I was a little sad when Fressen announced they were closing. Not because I particularly liked it, but because it was the main option for a slightly fancier totally vegan night out, with wine (the other tasty option being Vegetarian Haven, without wine.)  A group of 7 of us went on their second day. Is it too early to do a review? Maybe. So take it all with a grain of salt. I hear things are still \"evolving\" and the menu might change. More desserts might appear. Anything could happen.   The Bar Snax menu looks interesting, and the idea of being able to have drinks and vegan snacks at midnight or 1 am, is promising, especially with Bar Chef next door (which has zero veganizable food options at all according to the last time we went...)  The Grasslands interior and drink menu is the biggest change when compared with Fressen. And those are really nice improvements. It's brighter, while still being intimate, and has a more open feel, with less cramped seating.   Another pleasant change is that the servers all seem friendly, and generally helpful.  Food is very Fressen-like, so if you liked Fressen, you will like Grasslands. I had a favourite go-to dish at Fressen.  I ordered the skewer and liked it. Everyone else ordered the seitan roast or the chicken. Bar Snax menu is the biggest change from the former, and it's full of crispy and bite sized options.  Major problem on our first visit was that we went in a group of 7, which means an automatic gratuity of 18% was added to our bill. But there was nothing on the menu to indicate this, the person taking our reservation didn't let us know, and the servers didn't mention it. Since we're decent people, we obviously added a tip, and so, double tipped. Womp womp.  I'll leave out the Facebook page drama that ensued after we commented about it on their page, but regardless, they did not handle the comments well, and shut off posting on their page entirely. Hopefully it was an educational experience.  To sum it up: Food is okay. Service is good. Bar (and associated menu) is great. Interior is great."}
{"text":"Really, really, good.  There are so many brunch options to choose from, I had trouble deciding.    My friend and I ended up splitting the apple fritters to start, then we both had the tofu benny.  The hollandaise was a tiny bit on the salty side, but still very tasty.  Loved the kale salad that came as a side.  The coffees were large, dark, and delicious, as all coffee should be.    The service was fantastic.   I will definitely return, I need to try the red velvet pancakes (what?!)."}
{"text":"We went here last night. We havent been for a while because we didnt enjoy the old tapas menu when it was fressen and they only had one dessert before which we didnt like.  However we are glad we returned as it was a much better experience.   First of all cost, it was $123 for two without tip , which is a lot.   The atmosphere was good. The waitress was nice but the food was slow in coming.They did change the cutlery with every service ( and even took my napkin once but quickly brought me a new one) so that is different from older reviews.   For appetizer I had the faux ceaser salad. The waittress pushed a bit to add the faux chicken on it and I wish I hadnt because the salad was great but it didnt really need the faux chicken in an appetizer. It made it too heavy. We also shared their Charcuterie Board, It was quite good and overall I enjoyed it and would order it again. the faux 'goat's cheese' is very bland.    We had cocktails. I order the cucumber lemonade with vodka, sounds strange but was delicious. My husband had a wine cocktail which he enjoyed very much.   Then for entrees he had the fettuccine which he raved about. and I had the portebella parmesan plate. I really enjoyed all the sides on my plate. The kale, asparagus, fingerling potatoes , etc were all perfectly cooked and enjoyable.  However the coating on the portebella was hard as a rock , and the cheese on it was bland. I struggled for a while and then literally had to chip the coating off to get at most of the mushroom underneath because I wanted my portabella mushroom . Unfortunately a lot of the mushroom stuck to the very hard rock-like coating ( I am not exaggerating). Next time I would order a different main.  For dessert we had the cookies and cream. It was Great! The soft chocolate pudding like sauce mixed well with the cookies. I would have like my cookies a bit softer but that is likely a matter of taste. The Chocolate cookie was the best.   We will return."}
{"text":"Grasslands is a wonderful place. The room is beautiful, staff are friendly, the menu is interesting, and the drink list is pretty great too.    I went here for dinner with a friend on a Saturday night, we has a few Dark and Stormies, and then I ordered the Seitan Roast, and she had the Mustard Crusted Tempeh.   Dinner was beautiful and also delicious. I have to say though, that the Seitan Roast itself was super chewy and was not the most flavourful or interesting. BUT everything that came with it was above and beyond. Presentation was impressive, and the assortment of vegetable accompaniments was varied and flavourful. I particularly loved the gai-lan and roasted fingerling potatoes.   I will definitely be back, but will probably order something different next time.   This is a super cute place if you are looking to take a vegetarian or vegan on a fancy date."}
{"text":"So delicious! Went out with my friend who is vegan for dinner- she recommended Grasslands. She had been here for brunch and I've been here when it was Fressen!   Unfortunately, I didn't have my ID on me, so I ordered the pamplemousse mocktail. It was delicious, with a grapefruity salt along the ridge- would have been lovely with the gin in it, but I enjoyed the non-alcoholic version. The bartender also mixed up my order and made a mimosa for me, so they brought me that on the house; also delicious and a nice surprise :) My friend ordered a glass of the shiraz which was really nice.   We ordered the risotto and the skewer, and they were amazing! The tempeh was delicious and now that I know what it tastes like, I have to come back and try more. Every flavour was quite unique but tied together so beautifully.   For dessert, we had the cookies & cream and the bundt cake. OH MY GOSH. They were amazing. The cookies were crunchy but soft at the same time, the mousse was creamy and rich, and the mango/cranberry coullis was great; tart enough to balance out all of the sweetness. The bundt cake was rich and had hot fudge in it; I was in chocolate heaven.   Overall, the food was amazing, and the service was great, friendly and approachable. Our server was fun and the music was great. Dinner is a great time at Grasslands; also check out brunch!!"}
{"text":"Great quality, very tasty and nice atmosphere.   All very heavy and large-portioned dishes, so come on an empty stomach and probably not worth it if you are counting calories, they have one or two salads but they aren't very interesting. The dishes have a lot of oil (or earth-balance? not sure) in them. There's definitely a priority on flavour over health.   The menu does not completely match the one on their website, I suppose they haven't gotten around to updating it. The dish I had planned to order wasn't on the menu, but I found something else.   Despite that, I had a very enjoyable experience and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Colour me impressed. As a carnivore enjoying brunch with (primarily) vegan family, I had the most amazing Monster Burger.   Not only was it fantastic and immense, IT WAS ONE OF THE TOP 10 BURGERS I HAVE EVER HAD.  (Yeah, I was shocked too.)  Fries were amazing, salad was excellent, the vegans certainly seemed to enjoy themselves, but that burger!   Portions were enormous, which matters little unless the food is excellent, which it was. I'm not switching teams anytime soon, but I'll never accept anything less than stellar vegan food again."}
{"text":"Dined here for winterlicious and I am so glad I did. The restaurant is small and cute, great atmosphere that's perfect for dates. Not a whole lot of seating so I would suggest trying to book reservations since the bar is small and right by the front door.  For appetizers we had the sweet potato fritters and beet salad. Firstly the portions for every dish we had were huge and we were already full after the apps. Both were so delicious. The fritters were crispy on the outside but perfect on the inside. The kale slaw was a bit tart and contrasted the fritters quite nicely. And the sunflower dip on the side was probably one of the best accompaniment sauces I've had. The beet salad was awesome as well. Who knew cashew cheese was so yummy?   Entrees were the home made seitan steak and the fettuccine with pesto. I don't know which one I liked more. The seitan had a great texture and tasted really similar to what I remember ribs tasting like. The roasted potatoes, grilled veggies and fruit salsa on the plate really worked perfectly. Everything was harmonious and even my dad who is a flat out carnivore was left with a clean plate. The fettuccini was probably some of the best pasta I've had and you'd never guess it was vegan. The tomatoes added a great pop of freshness.   As for dessert, they were out of the chocolate bundt cake so we had the replacement of chocolate mousse with a big delicious cookie, and an order of the chocolate truffles. Both of these dishes were out of this world. The mousse was creamy and rich and decadent. The cookie was thick and chewy. And the chocolate truffles were smooth and full of flavour.   Honesty out of all the winter/summerlicious restaurants I've dined at, I would have to say this has been my favourite experience and I have found my new go to vegan restaurant. The service was also super lovely and accommodating. They really helped to complete the dining experience. Overall, I could not recommend this place enough. While the normal menu pricing is a tad high ($16-19 an entree) It's good enough to impress even the pickiest meat eater."}
{"text":"Went there for Winterlicious 2015. Wow, what a treat! The starter was a traditional French Canadian pea soup, which as a recent vegetarian I must say is hard to find in vegan form. Wow, exceeded my expectations. The seitan steak was expertly done with several delicious and well-cooked accompaniments. Dessert was a delicious trio of dessert truffles, a wonderfully sweet, rich finish. Service was impeccable from start to finish, and the atmosphere was warm and chic.  My guest ordered a wonderful (if a little over-priced) cocktail and I had a craft beer on tap (always appreciated).  A great place to dine for vegans, vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. I will be going back, and soon!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because they've only been open for a while but I would not recommend this place. Went with a friend for dinner and we ordered the corn chowder plus 2 pasta dishes. The soup was fine - served in one bowl for 2 - but the pasta dishes were salty and heavy. Not what I expect from a vegetarian place."}
{"text":"The whole family headed down to this joint with high expectations. As longtime vegetarians we were hoping for an enjoyable experience.  We were sadly disappointed.  We had made reservations. We were seated in probably the most uncomfortable booth seating I have ever experienced. I could literally feel my back tightening up within the first 5 minutes. Fortunately, while I got up and stood outside for some relief, my wife was able to arrange to take the next table that opened up with real chairs (padded but hard as rock).  Our adult kids ordered off the summerlicious menu as did my wife. As the waiter completed taking our order he made an off hand remark about how my order from the regular menu would take a little longer - as we should know....  Waiting.  Waiting.  Finally the kid's fried mushroom thing arrived. By all accounts unremarkable - heavy on the batter, light on the mushrooms. Shortly thereafter their burgers and my wife's pasta arrived. The kids and my wife all agreed the burgers were tasteless, although the heavily salted buns were fresh. My wife's pasta was moderately warm but certainly not hot. It was extremely salty, understandable to a point as it had sun dried tomatoes but a bit excessive.  More waiting  My sesame crusted tofu finally arrived just as the kids were finishing their main course. Considering that We had been there at this point for about an hour and a half I was pretty hungry.  What a disappointment. The tofu was pretty boring, the sesame crust basically flavourless. The veggies on the side were lukewarm at best and not in the least bit plentiful.  The kid's dessert - some kind of vegan \"ice cream\" looked nice but tasted like a mistake.  At about the 2 hour point we were finally done and ready to take off. Just the bill to pay.   The waiter brought over the terminal and then proceeded to stand over me, looking over my shoulder as I completed the transaction, even though I had hinted that \"I'm good\" in an attempt to encourage him to give me some privacy. He really did stand over me as I entered the amount for the tip!  This same waiter had been refilling our water glasses etc. throughout the night and while he was okay, I could have done without the often repeated \"there you go my friend\"  In summary, never again.   If you are the restaurant owner, I'd suggest you spend some time there one evening.   The food needs an overhaul (same chef as Fressen? WAY too much salt), and your staff are walking around like they own the place - you could probably seat twice as many guests as you do if only your staff had a sense of urgency - especially the kitchen staff.  Not going back."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my experience at Grasslands. The restaurant is beautiful, the presentation of the food is superb, service was excellent and most importantly, the food is delicious! My friends who took me there are not even vegetarian and it's one of their favourite places to dine! Keep up the great work, Grasslands!"}
{"text":"Couldn't be happier! The place was crowded on a Wednesday night but the server was fantastic! We sat at the bar and she got us a great table after only a few minutes. We noticed the bar menu and when we sat at our table we realized the faux chikn bites weren't on the restaurant menu but she made sure we were able to get them. There were three of us and we each ordered a different appetizer and main meal; we were ready to make a few concessions for 'vegan' meals but we all loved what we ordered and can't wait to go back and try the rest! The meals were like real home cooked, stick to your ribs comfort food with none of the guilt. I was there when it was Fressen and I admit, I only went once; I didn't like the vibe and I only liked a 1//3 of what I tried. Grasslands was more than a pleasant surprise, I can't wait to go back. So happy it's in my hood!"}
{"text":"Dined on Wednesday, June 3rd.  A carnivore here and was blown away at the chicken entree that I swear tasted better than what real chicken tastes like.   Was served by Taylor who was fantastic, funny and really down to earth. Overall a cool guy. We also met one of the servers Jordanna, who was really sweet and fun to chat with as well. Its clearly run by a team of people who enjoy working together and enjoy working there.   No flashy fluorescent signs or creepy meat defying menus. Grassland feels like a real premium restaurant, that just so happens to be vegan."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Grasslands. Recommend the Charcuterie Board, BLT Ceasar Salad, Seitan Roast, Corn Fritters. \"Candy Apple\" (I think...) drink special is probably the best tasting drink i've ever had- fresh pressed green apple juice, fresh ginger, vodka and caramel schnapps in a cookie rimmed glass."}
{"text":"Finaly! a SEMI fancy vegan place to go to dinner. Make no mistake though, this isnt health food. This is still greasy and heavy and at times gluten heavy (can we say Setan?) BUT its amazing and delicious. The service is great too. give it a try."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends and was disappointed with service and food. We were told to wait for seating as we did not have reservations. The resto was not even half full and they made us wait for quite a long time, it didn't even seem like they were trying to get us seated. The waffle and fried chicken was so dry, and the waitresses took their sweet time in serving us. At the end when we paid our bill one of the waitresses said \"give your friend shit cuz he only tipped me $2.\" Be prepared for rude and inefficient service and dry, bland food if you decide to eat here."}
{"text":"(Really this should be 4.5 stars). My guest and I were from NYC and seeking Toronto's best vegan restaurant. We believe we may have found it. We were VERY happy with our meal, and would definitely return if we were ever in the city again. Our waitress was great, to begin with.  The Food:  The charcuterie plate: The least strong of what we ate, though still pleasing and interesting. It was a clearly creative dish, with two different types of \"meat,\" a \"cheese,\" an olive tapenade, olives, bread, pate, celery root and more. Both my guest and I agreed that the meat was the least successful. The cheese was pretty good, the pate and the tapenade were very good, as was the bread and the celery root.  The fried oyster appetizer: Delicious, though the kale underneath, while great on its own, was overpoweringly onion-y for our taste.  The mustard crusted tempeh: AMAZING. The meat itself was great, but the truly amazing part of this dish? There were 10 different items on the plate, and they worked together harmoniously. There was mushroom, spinach, broccoli, sweet potato mash, white potatoes, mango salsa and more on this plate, and it was all perfect.  The sticky toffee pudding: Yummy, and worth it, though not the best vegan dessert I've had. The cake itself was not truly a sponge cake (though I actually prefer it that way). It was unexpectedly banana-y, though that's not necessarily a negative. The date sauce would have brough more of the fruit flavor into it, instead of just being super sweet, though that and the almond tuile were still good.  The malbec was disappointing, though my guest truly enjoyed her beer.  ...A must try overall..."}
{"text":"I've only gone for brunch and it was OK. I got a pinacolada french toast, which would have been great, and I know french toast is usually made from stale bread, however this bread was TOO stale. Hard to eat, and ruined the whole dish. My friend order the chicken and waffle sandwich which was decent, but could have been more original. Might go again to try other menu items but would never get french toast from there again!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner and it was so amazing! My boyfriend is a hardcore carnivore and he had a chicken dish (forget the name). He said the texture and taste was incredibly similar to the real thing. The roasted veggies on the side was delicious as well. It is a bit pricey, but it comes with a lot of food!"}
{"text":"I was meeting a fellow vegetarian friend for dinner and we'd done Fresh to death so I recommended Fressen.  Much to my surprise it was gone but Grasslands was in it's place.  I arrived first and was the first person in the restaurant actually.  I got us a table and ordered a glass of wine while I waited.  Looking around the place has been remodeled since it's Fressen days and the cleanliness and decor was impressive.  The staff were friendly, funny and nice.  Service was prompt and the food was great.  I ordered the \"crispy oysters\" which were actually oyster mushrroms (very delish!) and my friend has the carrot, squash and ginger soup which was delicate yet hearty.  For the mains I has the fettucini and she had the beet salad of which I have posted pictures.  I was impressed with the pasta and it's presentation.  All in all it was excellent, my only complaints would be the music was a little too loud, as were the other table next to us.  They seriously did not know how to use their indoor voices.  I forgot to mention how reasonable I found the bill to be. $60 + tip included appetizer, soup, salad and a main plus a glass of wine.  Very reasonable!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could love this restaurant. Unfortunately, they tried to poison my husband twice in the same visit, so I cannot.  He ordered gluten-free items from the menu, which are clearly marked. And he told the server he has an extreme gluten intolerance, having been diagnosed with celiac disease. Nevertheless, the server served him one of his plates with a huge slab of bread on top of the food. \"Oh, gluten-free bread?\" He asked the server. \"No,\" she replied, staring at him. \"Umm, I'm allergic to gluten,\" he reminded her. She took the plate away, and yet still another of the items he ordered was served containing gluten-contaminated food (from the deep-fryer). We suspected the deep-fryer was contaminated, and asked her about it, at which point she confirmed it wasn't gluten-free. They fry wheat in there all the time, so people with celiac disease really can't eat anything that has been put in there or they will get very sick.  We were pretty unhappy. We paid for everything, including what my husband could not eat. We gave the server our contact info, along with a request that the chef/owner get in touch so we could help him make his gluten-free menu items truly gluten-free. We heard nothing for weeks. We then emailed the restaurant and heard back by email from the (very defensive and unwilling-to-modify-the-restaurant's-practices) owner. He eventually offered to send us a gift certificate so we could give the restaurant another try. The gift certificate never arrived, even after a gentle reminder. It's just as well.  Based on our experience, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone who has a true gluten intolerance. I'm sad about this, because otherwise the menu is fun (especially the cocktails) and the ambiance is cool too. But most of all I want my husband not to be poisoned, so we will not be back."}
{"text":"I was only visiting Toronto for a few days, so I wanted to make it to at least one good vegetarian/vegan restaurant during my stay. I was definitely delighted I found my way to Grasslands. I had looked up veggie restaurants online and read good reviews for this place. I'm happy to report I was not disappointed. There were no tables available, so I had to sit at the bar. Wound up being a good thing, as I was able to talk to the cool bartender and a nice guy sitting next to me, who was also there for the first time. I ordered the Crusted Chicken, which came with yam mash and roasted veggies. It was absolutely delicious!! I am a petite woman and it was so good, I pretty much polished off the whole meal, which was a large serving. I was concerned that the atmosphere might be snooty because many veggie restaurants in NYC, where I live, are full of pretentious people. That was not the case at Grasslands. There is a warm atmosphere, nice décor and friendly staff. The bartender was also useful at making recommendations when I couldn't decide what to order. Everything on the menu looks soooo tasty! I brought the chocolate bundt cake back to my hotel room to have as dessert later. It was quite tasty, but the small serving size did not warrant the $10 price.  One thing to keep in mind, there is no real signage to let you know you've found your destination, so keep your eyes open for a huge lion head painted on the front window. Kinda \"Lion King\" style. I highly recommend Grasslands to vegetarians and carnivores alike. If you're interested, they also have a Sunday brunch that looks great. Two happy thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Burgers are good. The steak is great. Pasta was awesome EXCEPT we ordered rigatoni with sausage. They forgot the sausage! In all three orders. Upon complaining they gave us sausage on the side? Completely unacceptable. (Side note: they broke 3 glasses while we were there for 2 hours??!?)"}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 star review. Some coworkers and I went here tonight for Summerlicious. While the service was good, we tried ordering a few drinks only to be told they were out of certain wines/beer. The food was great and beautifully presented, although I wasn't a huge fan of the seitan steak. I don't eat meat, so I wasn't expecting the flavour to be similar to red meat - I just found the texture was too tough. Overall it was a great experience and I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"BEST DINNER EXPERIENCE EVER..!  I have only wonderful things to say about our dinner at Grasslands..! #1 - Had dinner reservations for 4 for 6:30, and were promptly seated. Great start...our appetizers arrived right away..and they were amazing..we loved the Sliders and popcorn chicken!! #2 - The menu makes you believe that their entrees are delicious vegan cuisine and it was!! We loved the mashed yams and potato puree on the side...I had the mustard crusted tempeh which was excellent! I asked to speak to the owner so I could tell him how amazing his food was and he was happy to talk to us! We stayed as long as we could and even had the homemade cookies and chocolate mousse for dessert. I'm excited to go back again..I don't understand the complaints in the previous review..i guess some people just complain to get a free meal!"}
{"text":"I've gone many times, mainly for brunch.  I've always liked their food, love how everything is vegan.    I'm sad it's closing next weekend.  I'll be there for one more meal."}
{"text":"Three words sum up my dining experience this week at Grasslands - pretty freaking awesome!  I made reservations for my SO's sister birthday and we were greeted with big smiles to our table.  They had a veggieilicous menu special that our server informed us about.  We all opted to experience the menu in its true form.  We order the soup of the day and the corn soup for two; both soups were absolutely delicious!  If it was proper dining etiquette to lick bowls in public, I would have done so.  Our mains were equally delicious; from the mustard crusted tempeh to the fettuccine - each of us were fully satisfied with our meals.  We were unable to stay to dessert but looking over at the other patrons' tables they were scrumptious.  I will definitely be back for future meals!  Hopefully, they open for lunch soon!"}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of Fressen, and was so, so sad to hear that they were closing down. Luckily for me, Grasslands popped up only a couple of months later! The space is still really new, but I wanted to show my vegan support.   I went with my boyfriend (also vegan), and we decided to share a couple of dishes. For apps, we had the popcorn \"chicken\" which is way better than the normal fake meat fare that is usually at veggie restaurants. It's battered seitan, and comes with mayo (vegan of course) and ketchup, and is so, so good. My boyfriend is really into the more meaty veggie stuff, so we also had the seitan roast. It was kind of like the old Fressen one, but was stuffed with this miso date stuffing that added a nice sweet element to the salty seitan.   We grabbed dessert after hearing that they had finally changed from the old chocolate terrine (delish, but we've had it before). We got the Cookies and Cream dessert, which came with 3 cookies (chocolate chip, mocha, and one other one (I forget)), and cashew mousse.  Drinks were awesome, and the space looks way nicer than in the Fressen days. We sat in a booth in the back where the old bar used to be. The place looks so much fresher, though it still has the natural woody elements of old Fressen. They've done the walls with this wood panelling, and it looks pretty snazzy."}
{"text":"Loved it when it was Fressen, and I love it now!  Grasslands is the go-to resto for vegans wanting to dine in a slightly more upscale environment.  It's not fancy or anything, but it's a lot nicer ambiance-wise than most of Toronto's exclusively veg places.  And obviously the food is great.  I think that it should have closer to 5 stars, that's for sure.  I won't bother reading the bad reviews because I'll just get super annoyed.  There is an adequate selection of gluten-free options, although I reeeeally wish their sausage-y and seitan-y type things were gluten free, too.  My favourite Sunday brunch is the Grasslands ample tofu scramble plate with fries & salad, and their sinfully delicious (and gluten free!) apple fritters with strawberry compote.  And yes, I eat them both myself!  The service is usually very pleasant and personable, too."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here. However, the portions are (as almost everywhere in Canada so far) way too big for us Europeans ! We took two doggy bags home with our main course after sharing our appetizer (mushrooms in bouillon). Both the seitan bbq steak & portobello main course were really good. I had to try a dessert as it's not often I find a vegan dessert: the trio of cookies n cream were delicious, even if I'd preferred them with nice cream instead of the cashew cream, it was a bit too intense/ heavy. All in all, very nice place, pleasant waiting staff, beautiful decor."}
{"text":"So good. Had never gone to Fressen since my fiancee and I just moved to Toronto a few months ago after it closed. We absolutely loved it here for a somewhat fancy night out. There are quite a few vegan places in Toronto to go but not very many that are upscale like this. We each had a small bowl of their beet root soup and it was great. Lots of flavour. Then we shared the corn fritters, my fiancee didn't love them but I did. Good taste of southern food and a decent portion for an appetizer. For the main course, I had the seitan roast and couldn't have enjoyed it more. All the sides it came with were mouth wateringly good. My fiancee had the Rigatoni and enjoyed it as well.   Our service was great, had a bit of a wait when we got there since the host took a while to come to the front but once we got to our table, our server was great. Attentive and check in on us just enough.   Will definitely be back and highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I use to go to Fressen all the time so it was a little heartbreaking when I found out it changed name, decor and menu. A little sceptical at first I went with some fellow vegan girlfriends for Sunday brunch and I must say the food is just as awesome if not better. I still like the old decor but I have been back for the delicious food several times since."}
{"text":"As a total omnivore, this was quite an experience. I have to say it was delightful. Their cocktails are fantastic.   We ordered the crispy kings - which were quite nice, and the Charcuterie Board - which was lovely - the deep fried olives were a great touch. The Portobello Parmesan platter was great. Every side dish was fantastic. Their fries are beautiful. Their salads were lovely. The desserts were quite nice as well.   I appreciate that they offer so many gluten free options. I also appreciate that the menu isn't completely inundated with tofu - which is a popular ingredient in the vegan world.   The staff was very attentive and helpful.   I would recommend this place to anyone. It was a very nice evening."}
{"text":"Amazing.  The food was delicious.  They made tofu VERY well (which is quite difficult for many restaurants).  It was quite filling.  The ambiance was so nice too, much nicer than any other vegan restaurant.  Other veg places have great food but aren't the nicest inside.  Moderately priced as well, especially for what you get.  Great customer service as well.  I'd definitely come back from brunch dinner, or drinks, everything looks amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the farm-to-table aesthetic you see in loads of restaurants now, but it's all vegan!  When I walked in, there was no one at the bar and no host or server in sight, so I sat myself at the bar. It became clear pretty quickly that they were absolutely slammed. Nonetheless, the apologetic bartender was really nice and I asked him to make me whatever he felt like making. The result was a delicious, refreshing cucumber vodka lemonade with pineapple juice. YUM! The dinner was excellent as well. I tried the chicken dinner, which came with broccolini and mashed potatoes. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Recently came here to try their summerlicious menu. Was hands down the best restaurant out of the five that I visited.   Crispy kings - delicious, crispy mushrooms with a tangy sauce. Great appetizer, good portions Seitan steak - sooo delicious - great texture, so juicy and intense flavours - they really got this one right.   My boyfriend, who is neither vegetarian nor vegan, loved the place too.  Definitely looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I don't go here often but when I do go, I really enjoy it. I love the burger boards, the little sliders, and the mustard crusted tofu. The drinks are delicious and boozy, as well. Nice atmosphere, great for a special meal as it is more upscale and expensive!"}
{"text":"Ordered the seitan steak, mustard-crusted tempeh, and zuchinni fritters. Food was pretty decent, with some interesting flavours.  Zuchinni fritters weren't that special, I wouldn't order them again. The seitan steak and tempeh were both quite nice - good texture and flavour.   Overall, nice atmosphere and decent food, but a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"came here for dinner one night in the last month - walked with no reso's on a sat night - took a few min only to be seated I read some reviews prior to and heard they have meet dishes! and even the menu shows steak and chicken - but everything is definitely vegan lol i had the steak nonetheless, and it was actually pretty good - it didn't taste like a real steak, but it was good flavour for sure - even the side options were great. so ya maybe not use the words chicken steak etc on the menu  - but overall it was worth checking out"}
{"text":"I came here because one of my most awesomest Yelp friends invited me to a vegan meetup.  While I'm not a vegan (or even vegetarian), I tend to have my vegetarian moments (though I love meat, my favourite food is tofu...go figure).    Anyways, I ordered the sliders, crispy oysters, and had one of my friend's corn fritters along with an Augusta Beer.  In order of first to worst.  1) Sliders - while these were tiny, they were so filling as it had both seitan and black beans in it (my poor washroom....tmi...I know).  The patties were awesome and probably one of the best veggie burgers I've had.  The soft buns accompanied the patty perfectly.    2) Corn Fritters - These were really good and tasted like a giant samosa filled with veggies.    3) Crispy \"oysters\" (mushrooms) - these seemed to have too much batter to me and not enough mushrooms.  However, other people liked it.  It tasted like mushroom tempura, and I don't like tempura.  Maybe it's because I just don't like fried food that much.  However the kale salad beneath it was delicious.  I love kale.    4)Augusta beer -  While I don't drink often (though Yelp events are making me become more of an alcoholic....ugh...), this type of beer is why I never liked beer.  It reminded me of a Labatt Blue or Molson Light, and those are the two beers I despise the most.    In terms of food temperature, they weren't piping hot, but they were sufficient.   For items 1, 3, and 4, I paid a total of $29 before tip, which I find reasonable and the portion size. So I think for food it gets 4/5.  Service:  The bartender was kind of odd, but otherwise food seemed to come out around your standard restaurant time - 10 to 15 minutes. I didn't like that they didn't serve napkins or cutlery and you had to ask for it. I understand the environmental factor of napkin wastage, but what about buying reusable napkins?  3/5  Atmosphere: It's dark, but seems like a decent hangout place and possible date place.  4/5  Verdict: Would visit again and for those non-vegetarians, would recommend the sliders first."}
{"text":"I am neither vegan nor vegetarian, just an adventurous foodatarian. Today's adventure brought to the Grasslands, as I have always wondered what life is like as a herbivore. If Grasslands is any indication, I can tell you that grass may actually be greener on the other side...har har har.    The food: Chicken and waffles ($12) - Mmm very yummy for \"chicken\". Made from seitan and tofu, you can hardly tell that it wasn't actually made from our clucking friends. Well seasoned and crispy. Monster burger ($13) - Made fom black bean and seitan patty. The bread they use is super fresh and soft. Not to mention they were super generous with the guac. Darn it, generous guac wins me over every time.   Brunch plates come with delicious house fries (the thinly cut kind with that high deep fried surface area to potato ratio...mmmm), kale salad, and two dainty slices of watermelon. Portions, along with service are generous. Two green thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Another Happy Cow suggestion and spot on! This might be the best vegan restaurant of our 7 day trip visit to Canada!  Here is what I will say.....the service was impeccable...friendly attentive...everything you would want.  The food...we ordered the ceasar salad with chicken (which I would highly suggest) very filling and a good portion for an appetizer. For the entree we ordered the seitan steak.  We actually had to take photos and post this one because it actually looked like a steak but of course was an amazing homemade vegan seitan steak.  It's always fun for us to post for our meat eating friends. BUT if you are not vegan or even vegetarian, I guarantee you will be completely satisfied by plant based protein at this place. The flavors were spot on.  If we chose one restaurant to come back in Canada, it would be this one!"}
{"text":"Popped in last week for an early dinner and was pleasantly surprised. I had mustard-crusted tempeh, while my wife had the skewers. Everything was tasty and our waitress was attentive and helpful. Prices are reasonable--$18 for mains and $11 for salads and apps (the sliced beet salad was well worth $11)--and they had some nice wines by the glass. Getting there early and beating the rush is probably a good strategy, at least for now."}
{"text":"Engaged in this new experienced with a vegan friend and it was a good experience.  I really enjoyed my appetizer of crispy oyster mushrooms with the side of kale salad.  They were made fresh as evidenced by the sizzle that was still heard on the plate as they were brought to the table and the oyster mushroom held up well amidst the cornmeal & herb batter.  This was my first time having organic tempeh and it came in the form of a steak that was flavoured well with dijon mustard coating for some kick.  Everything on the plate was well seasoned and done with care.  Though we didn't get a chance to partake in dessert, the atmosphere was very relaxed and the service was great.  Additionally, since the meal was fairly healthy and full of wonderful veggies that it made rocking out to Avicii a few hours later that much more entertaining and captivating!"}
{"text":"It is difficult to find a restaurant that a vegan and her carnivore husband can eat at together. Grasslands gets a five star rating from both of us!!!  We shared the apple fitters. DELICIOUS  We each had the green eggs no ham. Equally delicious. The Bloody Mary was incredible.  The only drawback was that they had run out of Daiya cheese but hopefully that's not a regular occurrence. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I showed up to Grasslands on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. We didn't have a reservation but they managed to seat us anyway, although not before a rather long wait and a strange air of indifference from the staff. Despite this, we were hungry and happy to be eventually seated. The restaurant did not seem to be especially full, although the staff seemed quite busy and we had to flag someone down to get our orders taken. I ordered the apple fritters and the guacamole grilled cheese while others ordered the \"chicken\" and waffles, hangover helper and waffle of the day. We waited a fairly long time for the food and were not provided with updates. The food did not come out at the same time, leaving some at the table without food for far too long. At one point, one of the waitresses said she was going to get the last plate, but it did not arrive for another 10 minutes.  On to the food - we received the apple fritters first, which came on top of a berry sauce. They were very greasy and tasted of baking soda, overpowering the taste of the apple. However, the portion size was very large for the cost and the sauce was good. Most of the mains came with a side of fries and salad, both of which were decent although the fries could have been crispier. The guacamole grilled cheese had a good flavour but it was drenched in grease. The \"chicken\" and waffles was a disappointment. It was presented as more of a sandwich, with tomato, lettuce and mayo. The breading of the chicken lacked flavour and was very hard and dry, making for an unpleasant chewing experience. The waffles were pretty good, although it did little to compensate for the taste of the chicken. Based on my friends' comments, the hangover helper was good while the waffle of the day was sub-par.  It seemed that flagging down the wait staff had become a regularity, whether it was to get more water or to get the bill. By the end of the meal, we were displeased both with the taste and the long period of time it took to get served. However, I will concede that the wait staff were friendly in our interactions with them...until the end. As we settled our separate bills, one of the waitresses told one of my friends \"you better give your friend sh*t\" for not tipping enough on the bill. At this point, our opinion of Grasslands was sealed.  Pretentious service, mediocre food. Stay away from Grasslands."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place after the great Yelp reviews. I came here on a Thursday night. Expecting it to be busy, we made a reservation in advance but the restaurant was relatively empty so that may not have been necessary.  The food was mediocre for me - I ordered the chimichurri tofu. There were a lot of flavours, but I felt that the tofu and zucchini sides were served with too much sauce. The side salad was mediocre as well. My friend ordered one of the burgers but was not impressed with the quality.  Overall the atmosphere is casual but trendy. I would still try Grasslands again, perhaps for brunch. Hopefully the food will be better next time."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night dinner since our other picks were closed already.  I really liked the ambiance of the restaurant but unfortunately the service was questionable We came in at about 8:45 and they close at 10. The waiter looked clearly upset that he had to wait another table.  I ordered a caesar salad (with balsamic dressing) and \"chicken\". Nothing special... meh  I'm still not sure why he didn't bring our waters until we were 75% done our salads and had to ask him again (it wasn't like it was busy) The waiter was lame and so was food... I'm not going back lol"}
{"text":"Vegan or not, you will really enjoy this place. The food is really great, and the portions are quite large. Pretty inexpensive for what you get (about $20 for a big entree). The atmosphere is also pretty cozy and quiet and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Vegan restaurant food done right. Oh and they do brunch. Basically, it's perfect.  Have been here twice - once for dinner in a large group (a bachelorette, actually) and then again with a friend for brunch. I really like how they can accommodate large parties but also have cozy booths for smaller groups. Also everything was super tasty and the portions are really generous. Will definitely be going back and wouldn't hesitate to bring non-vegans here at all."}
{"text":"Probably the best vegetarian/vegan (it was so good if it were vegan I wouldn't even know) restaurant in Toronto. The waiters were also really friendly and the atmosphere was relaxed and quiet."}
{"text":"My wife and I (both vegans) loved Grasslands.  We spent our honeymoon in Toronto and made an agreement to not dine at the same restaurant twice while on our trip.  Grasslands made us violate our agreement.  We dined there the last two nights of our trip and loved the wide array of vegan options and the service from our uber-friendly bartender, Dee.  We will definitely be stopping back our our next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Food was great! Innovative and unique vegan food.   Although our server was nice, the service was extremely slow. Both our drink and food orders took an unreasonable amount of time to arrive and the delay was not acknowledged, implying to me that this was not atypical at grasslands. For that reason alone I won't come back."}
{"text":"I needed to ask again even though it says online their vegan because their menu says chicken , cheese with no \"  \". I could not believe it!!! OMG! I'm in haven !!!! i ordered on A sunday brunch the chicken waffles and my partner ordered some scramble thing both were delicious!!!  We came there for every meal and it was bang on every single time. I want to move there for this restaurant . not kidding.  Go try it-if your a true fat vegan like me you'll love it :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Everthing from the corn fritters to the skewer, the grilled pineapple chunk is quite possibly the best tasting thing I've ever had"}
{"text":"So my honest opinion was Grasslands was mediocre at best. There's a few reasons why i think this.  I'll start with the positives first. The space is nice, relaxing and intimate. There are certain epiphany moments in the food that makes it memorable. Their avocado salad is something to write home about in terms of taste, creativity and presentation. And yes, all their dishes are presented beautifully (except for maybe their pastas).   But that's sort of where it ends.  The reality is the service is mediocre (i.e no water service, no change in cutlery/plates between courses/ poor kitchen timing, etc) . At their price point and for the type of place they are trying to be, i would expect a little more in the service department. I also had a bit of a strange 'i don't really care' attitude from the hostess when i asked for an internet password.   The food is quite good overall, but there's some issues. I tried roughly 80% of the menu in a group of 5. The salt levels were all over the place, for example, the corn chowder lacked salt while the pasta was the opposite. I found this theme resonated throughout the dishes in our meal.   There definitely is a texture problem going on as well. i.e things just don't compliment each other. It's also almost as if they just throw on crisp into every dish to make it interesting and compensate for that. Which btw is their taro chips. Seriously, it's in majority of the dishes - it was good the first time round but you get a little tired after a while.  There's also a freshness issue going on perhaps. We ordered two rounds of the sliders. One set actually tasted fresh and one had a musty taste to it (i thought i was going crazy but others at the table agreed). Another example - our dessert had three cookies on it - one rock hard and stale, one a couple days old and one that was absolutely fresh and moist. At the end of our meal, our server inadvertently blurted out to us (without any prompt) that things are made three days in advance in a rolling cycle. It all made sense.    Overall i'm happy for a better vegan option in the city. But having a nice interior doesn't only translate to a better experience. The essentials are lacking. I'd go back for a birthday or something if I was invited to go here, but i wouldn't go or recommend this place to others on my own accord.   I'm sure things will get better for them. I still feel that they have promise once the rush of being new dies down and they have to start focusing on development."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now.  Most dishes are a hit but some are a miss.  The Seitan Roast is VERY chewy and bland. I do not recommend this dish at all. Everything else I've tried  is pretty good.   I haven't tried the brunch yet but I've heard good things.   In terms of decor/vibe this is the nicest and fanciest veg restaurant that Toronto has to offer. Definitely recommended for a nice date night."}
{"text":"Stopped by with a group of four on their first Saturday night for dinner at 20h. We were lucky enough to get a great table even without a reservation on a busy night. The bar tender and servers who helped us were all top fantastic.  The menu offers good choice for both dinner or just in for drinks and grazing. We ordered a bunch of stuff to share, corn fritters, crispy oysters, seitan roast, beet salad, crusted chicken, and the cookie desert. I really liked the crispy oysters and the seitan roast!  As mentioned the service was great, I spoke with the bar tender when I arrived, and two servers took care of us while ordering and serving and all three were outstanding. Very pleasant and pro while relaxed and personal, totally suits how I perceived Grasslands.  I was a pretty huge fan of Fessen back in the day, so I'm not disappointed that the food still has a fressen feel to it, and I'm happy a nice vegan restaurant exists once again. Though the service seems to be entirely better then the indifferent children that used to serve at Fressen over the past three years.  Yay, I'm a fan.  The only disappointing thing to me is the inclusion of 2 pasta dishes on the menu. This is a personal thing, and some people love ordering pasta at restaurants, but with a small menu like Grasslands those 2 spots could be filled with something much more interesting and creative."}
{"text":"Good food, ok service.  The cold press mocktails are awesome & the foid could even work for an meat eater.  I was disappointed in the service, but the food made up for it."}
{"text":"The service is a bit slow, but the food is worth the wait. I recommend the caesar salad (add chicken) and crispy kings. The crusted chicken is also pretty good, though tonight it was a bit over cooked."}
{"text":"A great fine dinning experience!!  I have been to this place several times with my friends and we all loved it. We got very friendly service with a smile and delicious food. They make their lights dim and light a candle on the table in the night. I love their veggie Kebob (posting a picture). I highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"There are plenty of vegan restaurants in the Toronto area... but the upscale quality to this restaurant makes it really unique.   I had the mustard crusted tempeh, which came with a variety of sides including yam mash, mango chutney, thyme roasted potatoes, asparagus and gui-lan, sweet potato, and some kind of vegan gravy. It was all delicious! The flavour and texture of the tempeh was amazing - I would recommend it to even people who aren't familiar with vegan food."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner for the first time and ordered off of the Winterlicius menu they have held over until Feb 28 2015. Nice atmosphere, we sat in a large padded booth. My meal was good but not great. I really enjoyed my appetizer the deep fried sweet potato fritters. I was expecting one but got three deep fried sweet potatos that came with a really tasty creamy dip. Our main courses took probably 30 minutes after we received our appetizers to come out. The restaurant was about half full. I think perhaps everybody ordered the risotto. I thought the risotto was the part of the meal I liked the least, I'm a vegetarian not a vegan so I do enjoy my risotto with a creamy/cheesy taste. My wife's Seitan steak looked like a real steak with grill marks and everything. Her meal wasn't hot enough, but she was too hungry to send it back. We both had the chocolate bundt cake and enjoyed it very much. We will return and try more menu items and perhaps my rating will change."}
