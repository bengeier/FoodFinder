{"text":"The Ontario Bistro does an excellent job for what it is. A friendly, clean, restaurant that serves quality, home cooked meals. Prices are very reasonable, if not cheap. The food is great, always fresh, and generous portions. The 'usual' breakfast includes 3 eggs, 4 pieces of bacon, home fries, a slice of fresh tomato, and a coffee for less than $6. A great value. Breakfast seems to be the busiest time of day, and never feels overcrowded. Lunch specials are usually available. I've had the days soup (freshly made), hot beef sandwich (you can tell the beef was cooked there, no processed or short cuts), mashed potatoes, and veg for under $10. Ask the waitress for the daily special as it's not always easy to know what they are. There is a sheet on the bar listing the specials, but it's easy to miss. The hamburger, corned beef, and BLT are also good. The menu is large and includes steak, chicken, and pork.  The exterior is not inviting and I avoided this place for a long time, despite being told how good it is. Once inside, the place is comfortable and very pleasant.  You get the impression that the place is run by people that take great pride in their work. This gets high marks from me."}
{"text":"For what it is - a family restaurant, not at all in the least a 'bistro' - this is a great place.  It has, without exaggeration, the best pancakes I have ever had.  They're fantastic.  Nothing fancy, served with real maple syrup, but just from the big jug that it comes in.    Other stuff there is decent too.  Nothing special, but decent.  But once I tried the pancakes, I never ever get anything else there.  mmmm.  Pancakes for breakfast.  mmmm."}
{"text":"It's a pretty good sign when you walk into a diner and see that the cops eat there.  Decent diner food, heavy on the starches, at a very reasonable price point--service could have been friendlier, but the food was tasty and filling so I expect I'll be back the next time I need a hangover breakfast in the area."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there with the wife while we stayed across the street at the royal oak inn.  The food was accurately described and well priced.  The neighborhood is sketchy but on the inside of this place you feel safe comfortable, and in good company.   Definitely worth the try"}
{"text":"Are you tired of heading out to breakfast, only to wait 1/2 hour in line, then be seated in a small, crammed corner table to eat breakfast for 2 that runs your $40 in the end? I know I am, and that is why I love this spot.  This place is not modern or fancy, but it is clean, efficient, good and CHEAP! Me and my husband stroll down this sketchy part of town on a Saturday morning to the Ontario Bistro and each order a usual, 3 eggs any style (I like mine scrambled) 3 sausage or bacon, 2 thick sliced toast, and fried potatoes. We get 2 glasses of orange juice and the total with tax and tip (drum roll please...) $16.00!!!!!! For that price, it's a great breakfast. Total grease spoon, diner style. It's very comforting, in the way I remember mom making breakfast growing up.  If you need fancy made breakfast with home made jams, ketchup's, organic multigrain breads, juiced my the order orange juice, then this is not the place. But if you just feel for some simple, good bacon and eggs, in a clean,friendly restaurant that wont run you $20 per person, then check this place out."}
{"text":"Walked by this place while staying nearby and went in for breakfast.  Great breakfast for a good price, and the staff were lovely.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've only been for breakfast, but it immediately became my favourite local breakfast place. Tasty, cheap, relaxed, etc. Ontario pops the brunch bubble."}
{"text":"So there is a real lack of breakfast places near parliament and dundas.  It is a very sketchy area, so you really don't expect much, but this place is a hidden gem.  Clean, friendly service and good cheap breakfasts.  I get the usual, eggs scrambled, sausage, fried potatoes, toast and a juice and it isn't even close to ten bucks.  Good basic diner style breakfast served up lightning fast."}
{"text":"Today's special is a cheeseburger combo for $7.50. Comes to the table quickly and hot. Staff are very responsive to my hunger. A great place for fast, standard fare..."}
{"text":"Came from Florida and was staying at the hotel across the street.. Loved it! Family owned.. food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Nice family-run diner. Food is accurate, quick, and has amazing value. There's nothing particularly interesting or unique on the menu but that's not why we go.  The specials are always nice though. They're even licensed....I'm pretty sure you can get a shot of grey goose vodka for $6 (who would bother?... but still). The server who is usually there is really friendly and on top of her game.  I've never seen someone manage that many tables during a busy lunch service.  She always manages for refill my coffee many times.   Our go-to meals are the big breakfast with pancakes and and a BLT with Greek salad. Anyone who complains about this place just doesn't understand value for money or how restaurants work...it's not fancy but what do you expect from those prices? Go to origin and pay $30 a plate for brunch if you expect more."}
{"text":"Used to eat here but not anymore, there was a cockroach and the girl killed it with her hand and played stupid like it was a fly and just how she handled it with stupidity turned us all off. The situation honestly  could've been dealt with differently and not acting like we're idiots, plus if it was crawling out and about while ppl are there then that means they have a problem and need to get it under control."}
{"text":"The Ontario is a little gem in the Cabbagetown area. The service is friendly, the food is always yummy and the prices are great. Deffiently a traditional spot"}
{"text":"They've changed their name (and signage) to \"Ontario Restaurant\", which is good, 'cause this ain't no bistro. That being said, it's interior is a bit of a pleasant surprise when judging by the exterior, and stretch of Dundas St. where it resides.  The breakfast specials (which two of us had - eggs, bacon, home fries, toast AND coffee) were a deal at 5 bucks. My veggie omelet, which was decent and included the same sides, was 7. Eggs Florentine got the \"thumbs up\". The coffee was above average, the home fries (sliced) were well cooked if a bit bland, and the eggs and toast were standard fare. Comparing the quality and price with MANY other diners, this is a deal.  Why only three stars? The meal was definitely worth 4, but the service was slow, the waitress was dour, and the coffee was refilled only upon request. Every Yelper knows - it's ALL about the service."}
{"text":"A perfect neighbourhood diner with friendly, family-run service. The fried saganaki is great."}
{"text":"It appears Yelp has finally ditched the \"pokemon near by\" button. Now if they could ditch the girl in the bath tube (real classy). The place is very uninviting because of its location and exterior. I've driven by thousands of times and never felt the urge to go in. But once inside, the place is actually quite ok for what it is.  Very clean and friendly. One waitress for 70 seats and she handles it well and is very friendly. The food was better than expected, I like that they offer rye bread as an option, that's important to me, and the service while a bit slow was better than most places of this ilk.  I would go back although I am not comfortable with the location. If you like the Tulip restaurant, which I don't, you will love this place.  It is like the tulip but refined lol.  The tulip has a dozen waiters and you wait forever and they have rye bread in house but won't substitute."}
{"text":"Excellent neighbourhood restaurant, friendly service and good comfort food.  Try the Greek salad,  and Nancy's yoghurt fruit crunch. It's a complete meal!"}
{"text":"Came here thursday evening for dinner. We were the only customers, makes sense because their menus are mainly breakfast items. But they have all day breakfast so I got the pancakes! It was three large but thin pancakes, served with a plastic syrup bottle, butter in a tiny plastic container, and orange pekoe tea (or coffee). The lady asked nicely how I like my tea and brought honey and milk. My friend order pasta which looks good.  A bit old and dim, and empty (at the time) to be honest, but if you just want food, this is a reasonably cheap place :)"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other day after hearing good things about it from friends! I was very happy I chose to go here because the food was delicious and very filling (big portions). Not to mention I got the Big Breakfast which is so much food and only $10.75 (2 pancakes, 3 eggs, home fries, bacon, sausage, toast) and tea or coffee is included in that price. My boyfriend got the gyro pita with fries and he really enjoyed it, but was also very full!  I look forward to trying many more dishes here and highly recommend this place to anyone. They have a wide range of dishes on the menu, so there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"ahhhh .... i love how all three reviews have commented on the sketchiness of this neighbourhood! Yes unfortunately, I live just down the block from this breakfast joint (we subletted via craigslist while overseas!). so we wandered in on a random weekday.   the menu they have posted online seemed regular enough. it's super CHEAP (i.e. steak and potatoes for $17 something), so after testing it out ... it really wasn't bad. i've paid way more to have way worse steak! i also had a burger of some sort ... super yummy!  the place is a super low-key, non-fancy diner place. Our server was nice, being straight up about the mashed being out of a can! There's a super old cook in the back, who looks like hes about 100 years old and been there forever. and we often saw regulars (or just random stranger i guess) waltz in from the street, head straight to the coffee machine, poured themselves a cup, and then left some change on the counter and left lol. Is that a normal thing to do around here?"}
{"text":"We were just going for a walk when we found Ontario Bistro on Dundas East. It is not the best of areas, but we were looking for anything better than just a greasy burger place to satisfy our hungers. What caught our eye more than the round windows out front which gave the building an inviting entrance, the menu outside the front door is something that I always love. The inside of the restaurant was very unexpected. Clean, fancy, and just really casual looking.  Dressed in our usual clothing, we caught a few looks as we entered as if we did not belong there. That of course never stopped me before when I have money in my pocket to burn and a hunger in my belly that needs to be satisfied. Even though busy, we were seated promptly by a very friendly hostess.  The first thing we noticed when we started looking at the menus were how low the prices were for such a nice looking place. This raised the beginnings of a red flag because when prices are that low it usually means quality is too, we decided to still give it a shot though. I ordered the lamb chops and my friend ordered the chicken Parmesan.  The food did not take too long to arrive, although we were waiting longer than we had hoped (about 25 minutes). At first glance the food looked really good even for the price. The lamb chops were a little fattier than I am used to but were cooked quite well. They were quite tasty indeed. The mint sauce they came with was not my cup of tea though. The chicken Parmesan on the other hand was not quite as good. The chicken was a little dry and the sauce tasted like it was just heated Ragu. The roasted potatoes that came with our meals were actually really good. They were baked nicely and the spices were just impeccable. They were probably the best part of the meal, even though there were not many on the plate.  We should have listened to our half-raised red flag that we had when we first sat down. Not that the meal was horrible, we have just both had much better. While the service was friendly and the atmosphere was quite nice (other than the looks from the other customers), it just didn't make up for the lack of overall quality. \"Dining well is the best revenge\" is written on the menu, just don't end up here if you really want to get back at someone..."}
{"text":"Stopped by here while i was getting my car looked after at a near by shop.  It was choice between Tim Hortons and Ontario, 9 times out of ten, i will always go with the low key restaurants to see what theyre are working with.  I went into the diner and it was a nice old school look.  Order the hungry/big breakfast entails 2 eggs, 2 bacons strips, 2 sausages, 2 slices of bread, side of home fries(opt for french fries instead) and 2 pancakes all this for $10.95.  Server was pretty quick to take my order and provided me a glass of water with ice and a as well dropped a pitcher of water with ice.  VERY NICE i really do appreciate having bottomless water available on my table.  Bang Extra star for that.  Overall the food was great, the fries tasted a lil bit on the old fryer oil wise maybe they hD to change the oil on the fryer.  The pancakes were amazing tasted nice and crispy.  Wished this place was closer to home and i would be here probably 2 times out of the month way better than the sunset grill near my hood. If you like your breakfast definitely stopped by here"}
{"text":"Great family run joint  Friendly service  Great food  Great price   Classy Greasy spoon   Clientele are locals"}
{"text":"Oh, this meal hit the spot. A classic food diner with simple choices and cooked perfectly. Omelette, home fries, toast, and tea.  Loved it.  Service was attentive, quick, and not overbearing."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place so many times and always meant to stop in, but it took 2+ years for it to finally happen.  I'm so glad it finally did. It's basically my dream diner.  Bottomless coffee. A steady collection of regulars. A big menu of classic diner foods. All day breakfast. Beer on tap. A really fantastic mural with an eagle and a donkey.  Really, I just want this place to be closer to my apartment. Maybe I'll have to move closer, as long as they promise to expand their hours. Why isn't this place open late?  Given the location, I was expecting it to be a little sketchy, but it wasn't at all. Which is perhaps why they aren't open late."}
