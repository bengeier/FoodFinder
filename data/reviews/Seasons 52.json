{"text":"The food and the service here is exceptional. Especially if you are lucky enough to get Ryan as your server. I can't rave about the food enough. I have eaten here countless times and can't recall a single bad dish or experience."}
{"text":"Was a bit upset that I had made reservations prior with a special note for my girlfriend's birthday and they did not do anything for her. I even reminded them of this fact and they still forgot. Anyways, the waiter was very pushy about ordering more drinks even though multiple times we said we were okay with the ones we had ordered. He even was quite rude and confrontational when I wanted to order a beer that I had seen online but not on the menu. The food was very good. My girlfriend got the pork tenderloin and it was cooked very well and the sweet potato mash was very tasty. I got the seafood paella and it did a great job of bringing all the flavors together with the rice being not too mushy. The scallops were cooked perfectly as well. The deserts are the thing to get for sure they were divine. All in all was alright, food was excellent but the service was terrible and they forgot about my girlfriend's birthday special instructions."}
{"text":"Always tasty and seemingly healthy. Prompt service, creative menu."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant and a huge bonus is the calorie limitation on the meals. I have been here many (more than 15-20) times and I have never had a bad meal. The service is always excellent. I love the small desert portions too - they are just enough and they are fabulous!"}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices, good service and great classy atmosphere. Simply delicious choices with special seasonal options. There soup was delicious and the flat bread was great. There scallops were cooked perfect  and risotto was cooked perfect. Will look forward to next visit. Every thing I have tasted at this restaurant was absolutely phenomenal."}
{"text":"All dishes at Seasons 52 contain less than 475 calories. The portions are adequate, but don't expect huge portions. The menu changes each season to take advantage of what foods are fresh and readily available. The presentations are great, and the food is delicious. I usually order a fresh fish entree, usually salmon. However, on my most recent visit, I enjoyed a delicious halibut entree.

Seasons 52 gives you a selection of mini dessert indulgences that are served in shot glasses--just enough sweetness to enjoy at the end of your meal.

Seasons 52 has a quiet ambience and is a wonderful place to enjoy a meal and conversation with friends."}
{"text":"While strolling through the Biltmore, we came across this restaurant.  I liked how the menu revolved around dishes that are lower in calories then most restaurants.  This didn't come with a compromise in taste either.  

The service was very good both at the hostess stand (friendly) and with our waiter.  They were a little busier than I think they expected so the get the check took a bit, but you could see everyone running around being busy so no worries.

I ordered the veggie sandwich.  It was quite messy and falling apart, but so worth it.  It was very tasty.  I didn't like how it came with a plain jane salad though with a little too much dressing on it.  I wish there were other options.  My hubby had the buffalo chili and after trying a taste we both agreeded that was one of the best chilis we've ever had.  

We aren't in the area that often, but I haven't forgotten the restaurant and would like to return to try other items."}
{"text":"After I had made reservations at Seasons 52 i did a little research and found out what they were about.  their menu consists of meals that are under 450 calories i believe, which is a neat concept.  When we arrived for our reservation we were early so we waited at the bar and had wine.  they had a woman playing a piano and singing which provided a nice atmosphere.  The lighting is kind of dim making the menu a little hard to read but not to bad.  I started to get a little upset as it was past our reservation time and we hadnt been seated.  I got fed up and was about to go ask them what was going on when the host finally buzzed us. He sincerely apologized for the wait and gave us our first appetizer on the house!! I thought that was great cause it showed they care about their customers.  As a free appetizer we had the stuffed mushrooms which were amazing!! they had such great flavor and was an explosion in my mouth!! For an entree i ordered a special that they had which was a surf and turf that wasnt on the menu and was not under 450 calories but was so worth getting!! they gave me a six ounce filet over garlic mashed potatoes with three stuffed jumbo shrimp and asparagus!! Needless to say i was in heaven.  We didnt have dessert but we were so stuffed after our meal we couldnt make room.  ONe of the best dining experiences I have had.  Will definitely go back again!!!!"}
{"text":"Only once have we had a less-than-perfect experience here, and that was when we had a new server undergoing training.  Even then, it was still worth 3.5 stars!
Otherwise, this is our go-to place for a lot of years, mostly for celebrations but also for any time my wife and I want an excellent meal in reasonably quiet surroundings. It's an elegant restaurant with really well prepared food and usually attentive service (hella surprise for a chain that also owns Olive Garden and Red Lobster!!). Their menu changes seasonally, and whether you're flush or skint you'll find something there that'll please your palate and your budget equally. 
The little \"shot glass\" desserts are the perfect end to a good meal, too."}
{"text":"This place is great, they cook without butter and the food still tastes good!  I had the scallops and my husband got the grilled trout.  We also had a bowl of chili and manhattan clam chowder.  The chili was delicious!  The clam chowder was average.  My son and daughter loved their food.  My son had a burger with a side of green beans! The burger and beans were cooked perfectly.  My daughter had grilled chicken with broccolini and potatoes. Dessert was good and the size was just perfect."}
{"text":"Sfeervol restaurant; het gaat niet alleen om het eten zoals in sommige Amerikaanse vreetschuren, maar het eten is er ook fantastisch. Sla de Capital Grill ernaast maar over want daar heb je minder sfeer, minder goed eten, irritante obers en een belachelijke prijs."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this place. Sat at the bar and was welcomed with a smile.  The bartender gave great recommendations for meals. Ended up ordering the pork tenderloin and was blown away. I'm not usually one for pork but this was next level.  Perfect amount of char and tenderness.  Had their old fashioned to wash the meal down and although it's a simple drink and you can get it most places I was thoroughly impressed with the one I ordered.  It's a classic no frills drink and I assume that if you order one you already know what you're getting into.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten at another Seasons 52 it was okay.   Waiter was nice efficient.   The food very disappointing.  I had some good soup the chili. But my Caesar salad was beyond boring.   The greens seemed like they had been sitting on a counter for 2 days.   The chicken I had them add was void of taste.  The dressing out of a bad jar of boring dressing.   Ugh."}
{"text":"Seasons 52 was great! Tom F. @ the bar was awesome. Food and drinks were awesome and great price point! Make sure to ask for Tom if you stop in!"}
{"text":"Really bland food. That's the summary for this place. 

I should have known when they made a point of saying every menu item was 475 calories. 

The food wasn't bad but it was tasteless and pricy. This is not a two $ restaurant. Much more like a $$$. 

Not recommended."}
{"text":"Great fun! From the hostess to the server to the manager, we had a great time! Personalities all around. Loved the ambiance on the patio. We took the lemonade and made them adult lemonade which was fun...but, strong vodka...whew! 

The food was fantastic. Loved the beet salad and potato soup."}
{"text":"the restaurant atmosphere is nice and quiet, the food is good ,but some waiters are rude and disrespectful and i don't appreciate it."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY the WORST experience! Starting with the valet. He refused to park my 82 year old mothers vehicle, saying she didn't pulled up close enough to his podium. So she backs up the vehicle and pulls where he tells her too and then refuses to valet her car. She is very soft spoken and the valet kept saying \"I'm not talking to you\" over and over again! So we walked in and spoke to the manager about it. She only received half the story from him but was apologetic. 

Then we get ready to order and my mother asked what was in the side salad. The waiter states lettuce, tomato, sun flower seeds and something I've never heard of before. She stated she only wanted the lettuce, tomato and sunflower seeds. When the meal arrived and we started eating we discovered the salad had almond slivers and peanuts in it. My mother is deathly allergic to nuts and the file that Seasons 52 keeps on her with information such as seat preference, allergies and that she likes black napkins at the table etc. We know the waiter (Daniel) read her file because as we sat down he came over and handed the table black napkins and stated to my mother that he is aware she likes black napkins. So when we bring up the nuts in the salad to him, he says \"I had no idea\". Really???? You knew she liked black napkins but not that she was deathly allergic to nuts!

Point of me telling you all this is, if I'm coming to a high end restaurant and we made a reservation and you keep details about your regular guests please do your homework before you start your shift. Lawsuits happen when small details aren't followed."}
{"text":"Seasons 52 has become our go-to place for great ambience, easy free parking, and a varied menu that never disappoints.  Noise level so we can talk to our dining guests. Service is consistently outstanding.  What more can we want."}
{"text":"Fabulous. Terrific food, atmosphere, service, and prices. If that isn't enough, all meals are under 475 calories + free WiFi. One open in Dallas!"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant. My grandma wanted to go here because she is trying to lose weight and her weight loss doctor suggested our family come here for dinner. It is such a great concept for everything to be under 475 calories. Most restaurants should be serving food the way they do, only certain amount of calories, seasonal fresh and local foods at affordable prices. 

We sat in the bar area that was seat yourself and also has large booth seating and there was live music by a piano player which was a nice touch.

We had two flatbreads for appetizers which were great.
I had the seared sea scallops for an entree, which were cooked to perfection with the perfect amount of pearl pasta and asparagus.
We shared a bottle of wine as well and had mini desserts.
My mother, sister and grandmothers food was excellent as well.

I cannot wait to go back and try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"We had a lovely lunch with great service and great food!  The scallops were perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"hen we walked in and sat down, it was noisy. Our waitress Kimberly was charming but the noise level rose and rose till we could hardly hear our cousins. They opened an entire new room for us, and another group of four moved nearby for the same reason. But once they moved us, everything was fine, and Kimberly stayed as our sever, even though it really spread out her service area. The garlic chicken flatbread was enjoyed by all four of us, we had great salads made to our specifications ( and they were huge) and we all enjoyed our entrees, and they found sides that could accommodate my special restrictions. It was restaurant week, so dessert was included, and we were all happy--2 carrot cake, amaretto parfait, key lime. We were able to visit and talk, and We got great service."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. Was sat right away. We did however wait for a server to come over for quite a few minutes. No recognition from anyone. Until a nice and welcoming server came over named Russ. He asked if we had been helped yet. No problem he says. He helped us right away. The artichoke we ordered was very uncooked. Not edible at all. Russ quickly fixed this by bringing us more wine. The entire serving staff for the exception of Russ was very less than thrilled to be there. Most were moping around and goofing off. Russ seemed to be the only one working and enjoying his job! We will be back but we will definitely be asking for him."}
{"text":"The ravioli appetizer is really, really good. The steak and mushroom flatbread was just ok and the chicken and vegetable pasta was just ok as well."}
{"text":"Split artichoke flatbread & BBQ chicken salad with my mom.  Delish & so fresh. Ask for side of aged balsamic to dip flat bread in.  Heaven 
Mom had a glass of wine 
$30 bucks-not bad! 
Will be back!  Wish we had a restaurant like this In the Gilbert/chandler area 
So yum & healthy so u don't feel guilty or weighed down after"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting to be impressed, but I was.

Normally when I see a high traffic/expensive restaurant adjacent to a mall I'm skeptical, but today I was hungry and didn't want junk. The posted menu seemed inspired so I went in for a solo lunch at the bar. Very clean eating here, but they truly bring the flavor, and you will not leave hungry! Excellent choice for lunch or dinner.

Started with Pellegrino and black coffee. The bartender was friendly and helpful.
I like exploring the different methods of cooking chicken tortilla soup so I started with a small cup of that. Normally I prefer a clear, strong broth with lots of chicken and cilantro. Seasons' version is creamy and thick. The fresh cilantro is there, as is the roasted bits of chicken--really liked that-- but it was almost too thick for me. There were a lot of tortilla strips on top as well. If that's what you like you will love this version. The flavor is very good.

The tuna tartare starter was the star, and had I known I'd be fuller from the heavy soup, I'd have made it my lunch entree. I was expecting sliced tuna, but what I got was so much better! They serve diced raw tuna over a bed of avocado/wasabi mousse that has a thin layer of pineapple salsa. The whole thing is molded like a larger sized tuna fish can (to give you an idea of the size). It is served with a cone of extra crispy/spicy flat breads. I loved everything about this dish!

For my lunch entree' I ordered the red mole beef brisket tacos --with lettuce wraps rather than tortillas (they give you the choice). There are three ample tacos to this dish, served with sides of cilantro/verde sauce and red mole/chile sauce. These tacos were amazing. I had to take my time as I was full from the tuna.

Very good experience. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I am a simple man and I like my food to be simple. I went in search of such a place in Phoenix and found this nice place, Seasons 52.  The place is not too frilly and has a fabulous collection of wines out of which 50% of them could be had by the glass. 

I said to myself that I would try the dishes stated on the menu and ordered the Kalymnos Greek, Springer Mountain Farm All-natural Grilled Chicken and Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse.  I also ordered from its wine list - Sinskey, Carneros '09, an organic wine.  My selection was as per my simple requirements.  I chose the wine for its low alcohol content and I could have more glasses with my food.  

The mixture of olives, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers and feta cheese went well with my grilled chicken accompanied by tamarind, pumpkin seeds and potato mash.  The potato was just right and went well with the tanginess of the tamarind. The chicken was succulent and done a little more than normal, which is what I like.  The piano bar struts out good music as an added incentive."}
{"text":"Our second experience here was much better. We knew to stay away from the traditional fattier foods and stuck with healthier options. We had:
 - Mussels appetizer
 - Stuffed mushrooms appetizer
 - Chicken flatbread
 - Salmon
 - Scallops

Everything had quite a bit of flavor and was prepared well. We would return again!"}
{"text":"Restaurant has nice atmosphere and overall great service. Had a chicken pesto flatbread as an appetizer and it was delicious. For our entrees we had a short rib and the beef tenderloin. Tenderloin was cooked perfectly but the veggies were a little dry. Short rib had great flavor. The mini desserts in shot glasses are a great idea. Of the options we chose our favorite was the Key Line Pie and chocolate peanut butter. Would go back again when visiting Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I went to Season 52 for lunch today with my daughter and a friend. None of us had been before, so we each ordered something different so that we could try various dishes. We sampled the following: mahi mahi tacos, turkey wrap, goat cheese flatbread, double hummus, and quinoa side dish. All were delicious!  We also had two of the desserts - blueberry cheesecake and rocky road mousse. 

The service was exceptional, the restaurant is beautiful, the concept is fresh--nothing on the menu over 475 calories and everything made from fresh in-season ingredients. We all left very satisfied with our meal.  We will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Took my Wife  there for her Birthday,  our Waiter (Thomas) was so very nice and courteous, from the first moment he arrived at our booth up until the time we were walking toward the door his service was excellent. He even gave us a little tip on how to best order your Filet Mignon,  my wife took his advice when she ordered and after finishing her dinner said she totally agreed with him, noting that she will order it that way from now on. The appetizer we shared was delicious ( chicken on flatbread) and the Salmon I had was plentiful and delicious as well with an assortment of grilled veggies. We will definitely dine there again in the future, just hope all their employees are as nice and as courteous as Thomas."}
{"text":"I was eager to try Seasons as I had heard good things about the place. Nice decor. Bland food. I had the goat cheese ravioli. It was served with some veg (1 green bean, a couple of leaves of spinach, 1 piece of red pepper and a couple pieces of mushrooms) topped with some unidentifiable watery sauce. My partner had the trout which was cooked properly but had very little taste. Overall my dish all tasted of the same flavors.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"After reading many reviews of Seasons 52, I was skeptical about coming here but I'm so glad we gave it a try! We had a vegetarian in our party and when I asked about vegetarian options, the hostess pulled out a binder with vegetarian,vegan, gluten-free and lactose-free options. Wow, impressive! The ambiance is wonderfully warm and inviting. Our waitress, Kim, was very knowledgeable, friendly and provided fantastic service. Many reviewers commented that the portions were small, thus the under 475 calorie concept, but our portions were more than adequate...no complaints whatsoever (and we did not order appetizers or sides to fill up). All of our dishes were flavorful and tasty. The small desserts were a great treat, and just the right size, at the end of a nice meal.

Seasons 52 is a great addition to the Biltmore area and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pricey? YES. The food is AMAZING though. You will most def leave very satisfied. Took my boyfriend here for his birthday & he loved it (: very elegant set up as well!"}
{"text":"Seasons 52 was our choice for a birthday dinner and we had a lovely evening. The food was delicious and the service very good. For the appetiser we tried the flatbread, chicken skewers and stuffed mushroom. All were very good but the flatbread was my favorite. 
For the main course we ordered the lamb chops, filet mignon, the fish, shrimp pasta. Everyone loved their entrees and the portion size was just right. 
For desert, you get to choose from an array of mini samplers. Since i was so full, i settled for fruit . Hopefully will try something next time. Yes, there will be a next time also because I want to know what the menu in the other seasons looks like ( and also my way to pretend that we actually have 4 seasons in phoenix!)"}
{"text":"Food was great as usual! Need to go once every season to try the menu. Excellent portions and combinations. Love the healthy choices and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Scallops were delicious!... but served with the most basic undercooked green beans. The green beans didn't have any salt/seasoning and no thought put into them. My hubby got the 3 course meal- soup was great, but again, the side veggies were undercooked with zero seasoning."}
{"text":"Love thise place! Great healthy choices and awesome desert. I visit it all the time. Love th change in the menu too! Way to go in healthy choices!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a business lunch here and I was surprisingly impressed. The service was superb...we really felt well-looked-after and our server \"Rio\" was sharp, smart, and everything a good server should be. I had the spinach and raspberry salad with grilled salmon, and it was wonderful. I also opted for one of the 300 calorie desserts, cleverly served in tall shot glasses...just enough chocolate to whet my appetite, but not so much that I felt like a slug after lunch. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Driving around the Biltmore area and browsing all the restaurants, we came  across this place and I must say its Great food, great location, good service.. I think it's a bit pricey for a dinner night and I probably won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Boring.  Uninspired.  Generally sauce-less, which means the meat courses are plain and dry.  The salmon tastes like styrofoam.  The filet is flavorful but they use low quality cuts.  The veggies are simply steamed.  No doubt the options are healthy, but at the sacrifice of flavor.  When I pay this much to eat out, I want to taste it and enjoy it."}
{"text":"I took 2 of my coworkers to lunch at the Biltmore location of Seasons 52 yesterday.  The lunch was to celebrate and thank them for their help with winning a new account.  It turned out to be much less than that.  We arrived for our 11:30 reservation and were seated fairly quickly.  The restaurant was pretty empty at that point and we were seated in a comfortable booth across from the bar.  The server took our drink order and the place started to get busy.  We (I) quickly noticed a lack of attention from the staff.  Menus arrived finally and we placed our orders.  The server said they would soon be switching to their summer menu and told us about the special Copper River wild caught Alaskan salmon.  It sounded good, although at $29.00 +, it was expensive for a lunch dish.  So that's what I ordered.  It was a mistake.  The fish was dry and overcooked.  The snap peas on the side were small and chewy.  The \"toy box\" tomatoes were tiny and without flavor.  Overall, it was not nearly as advertised on the menu.  The waiter finally came to collect our dishes, but no mention of dessert.  He got the hint when I asked my guests if they were interested.  It seems that Seasons 52 overpromised and underproduced.  I won't hurry back."}
{"text":"Very good. Only thing to complain about was the occasional wait for service ( pouring wine, etc) but this seems common in Phoenix. Quality of food for the price is good overall."}
{"text":"This was fabulous food, service, and atmosphere! Can't say enough great things about the food and flavors! A can't miss restaurant for the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"An entire menu under 475 calories? Sign me up! There were four of us that ate here on Saturday and each one of us was completely satisfied with the quality of the food. My husband was still hungry after eating an appetizer and his entree, but he has a huge appetite. The rest of us were perfectly full. I got the sea scallops and want to go back every week to get them again. They were that good. We had the chicken pesto flatbread and it was delicious and perfect for sharing. My husband had the shrimp & risotto dish. It had the perfect amount of spice. There's a large wine menu and for non-alcohol drinkers, the ginger-agave soda is fantastic and another healthy alternative."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars except for the attitude of the greeter. I called and made reservations for a booth and did not receive one. Food was outstanding we had the lamb chops and the fillet. Everything on the menu is cook healthy and the service was great. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is great! My mom and I tried it a few months ago and it was delicious. I ordered the trout and for being under 475 calories (I think it is?) I got a huge piece of fish plus the veggies on the side. There desserts are unbelievable! While they are small they have a large selection and with them being so rich it's a perfect end to a meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant was okay!  I went here last year with a coworker and here are some of the positives:

Ambience: upscale appearance but casual dress.
Food: delicious. All of the flavors were there.
Service: outstanding.  Our server took very good care of us. 

The only reason why I gave this 3 stars is because I didn't realize that there food was healthy (my fault for not doing more research).  The one thing I can't stand is when I'm hungry after I leave the restaurant and that's exactly what happened after dining at Seasons 52.  Before I got home, I ended up going to In N Out to satisfy some cravings...YIKES!  Nice to know there's a good burger place open late at night!  :)  Seriously, for those looking for good tasting, low calorie, healthy dinners, Seasons 52 is for you!"}
{"text":"The ambiance, service, and wine list here are amazing! But sadly, that is where the amazing stops. If I were rating on service alone this place would easily be 5 stars. 

I also love that the appetizers are all under 475 calories - that's pretty fantastic. What I didn't love, is how they tasted. We ordered their steak and crimini flatbread, it came out kind of burned on the edges and the meat was super dry. Tasted a bit like fancy cardboard. 

Then there was the cioppino (an Italian tomato based seafood stew), usually one of my favorites. It's supposed to have hints of white wine and garlic, but that was nowhere to be found. In fact I think I detected an undertone of canned stewed tomatoes. This may or may not be the actual truth, but it sure tasted like it had a case of the Cambell's. My friend had the duck salad. She said it was equally lackluster. 

Culinary highlights included the crab-stuffed, bubbly-cheese covered baked mushrooms. YES they are as good as they sound. Oh, and the shot-glass desserts. Sinful but just a shot of sinful, and that makes it okay! 

Super low-light - the piano player/singer in the lounge. Let's just say, you do not want to be there when she covers the Beatles, and if she tries to bust out any Blondie... run."}
{"text":"As a Marine corps veteran I went to Seasons 52 on Veterans Day in Phoenix and had excellent service from Andrea D. and the rest of the staff. The food was great and I will be back."}
{"text":"I brought my mom and husband here for Thanksgiving dinner. I decided it was a good choice based on price and reservation availability. Our server Sakura (?) took great care of us. My mom had the traditional Thanksgiving dinner. She really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, most of the sides were not vegetarian friendly, so my husband and I opted for items from the regular menu. I had the clams with risotto. Delicious! I also had the truffle mac and cheese. Not great. The desserts in shot glasses were also enjoyable. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"The low rating is not for service. Our Waiter Michael was fantastic.  The major problem is the Gluten Free menu.  Ordered salad and menu stated Gorgonzola and it came with Blue Cheese.  Chef is not relating to service staff any changes to dishes.  If you have Celiac Disease don't eat here.  My wife's gut states the chef doesn't care about us.  Thank you for making my wedding anniversary worrying over my wife's pain."}
{"text":"It was a toss up for me on whether I would give this place a 3 or 4 star rating and I think the only reason I hesitated on the 4 star rating was because this place feels like a chain and I am not a fan of chains. I prefer local, small business owner type of places but I decided to give Seasons 52 a 4 star rating because they really do a wonderful job with their food, their service and their concept.

All menu items are 475 calories or less which is tough to do in big food America but Seasons 52 does a stellar job with their menu options and flavors - thank you spices instead of butter! I am a veggie/celiac which means finding food is always tough but Seasons 52 had both a gluten-free menu and a vegetarian menu. I opted for the Farmer's Market Veggies but switched out the tabbouleh for some corn cakes. The corn cakes were out of this world good. Kind of like polenta with herbs and then baked like a cake. The veggies were roasted or steamed and dressed with herbs, spices and a little salt. Yum.

The rest of the table enjoyed their meals and the fish tacos received Rave reviews from two of the folks at the table and they loved the wavy plate that nestled each taco. 

So - Seasons 52 gets 4 stars because they do their food right!"}
{"text":"I will not return to this place.  I went here for a business lunch and I guess I didn't understand the restaurant's concept.  I appreciate all of the items being under 520 calories, but I want my food to taste good and fill me up at the same time.  Because of this, I asked the waitress what the most filling item on the menu was.  This was the grilled chicken caesar sandwich.  Not very good and kind of smelled like rubber.

Anyway, maybe this place is better for dinner, but I wont return.

I do like their idea of having a seasonal menu though.  They switch the menu out for fall, winter, spring, and summer.  Good idea."}
{"text":"Was very impressed that the bar tender remembered us. It has been months since the last time we ate here. The dining area is always crowded, so as usual we ate at the bar. Very attentive service, fabulous cocktails, nice wine list, and great food. I ordered from the Restaurant Week menu. My friend always orders from their extensive gluten-free menu. Love their little desserts - makes you feel less guilty."}
{"text":"Wonderful.  This is a cozy atmosphere with dark wood and booths.  Like a casual version of Capital Grille.  I love that they have a piano playing at night.  It is so hard to believe how healthy the food is as it is delicious and filling.  I have been here a couple of times and enjoyed everything.  One time I got the tiger shrimp and pasta which was fabulous!  The snow peas and broccoli were crisp and fresh, the tiger shrimp were huge and the flavor was phenomenal.  All of it was in the most delicious light sauce.  Another time, I split a flatbread and got the spicy tuna sushi - and that was excellent as well.   I especially love those little desserts - mmmm!  So far I have tried the peanut butter, rocky road and key lime pie and they are all exquisite.  The service is mediocre but, everything else is wonderful."}
{"text":"Seasons52 is super consistent with their delicious food. It's all under 500 calories, but it's impossible to tell on most dishes. The skillet shrimp scampi is just awesome. The hamburger on the lunch menu is best I ever had, it's a blend of angus beef and mushroom duxell. They have this AMAZING dessert tray with shot glasses of heavenly concoctions, like 8 different kinds to choose from. I would have given 5 stars, but their inconsistent service killed it."}
{"text":"My husband took me to Seasons 52 for my birthday. We had a great time! Really romantic atmosphere at night and enjoyed the live music.

To start we got a few flat breads to share which were great! I got the scallops over a lemon risotto with asparagus for dinner and it was fantastic! I keep thinking about it and can't wait to go back! 

It's a little pricey when you are having wine as well but worth it! Also everything on the menu is under 475 calories which made it guilt free! Although they bring around individual desserts at the end to choose from in mini shot glasses! Could not pass that up! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant chain has always been a fave; love the food, the ambiance, service and piano bar. Chose this location when we were in Phoenix and had only one extra night to dine out and love the piano bar, which Yelp said they have. Upon arriving, was told they took their piano out about 2 years ago. Sadly, we had already committed to the location and yes, we did have a wonderful dinner but very upset they did not have the live music we were counting on as any other location I've been to does have the piano bar."}
{"text":"The food, service, and ambiance were all very good. I had a good experience and thought the price was very reasonable for this type of restaurant. If I return to this area, I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here to drink a few cocktails and to catch up.  We were seated and the waiter took our drink orders, brought them back, and then the inquisition began....'what do you want to eat? can I point things out to you?' he would not let up, he walked by every 2-3 minutes with new questions ' are you ready yet\", have I told you about the specials?'  it was so annoying.  

When we finally ordered --- stuffed mushrooms for my girlfriend and a sushi roll for me, the food was awful.  The mushrooms were way overcooked and the sushi roll was mostly thick with rice and small slivers of ahi and avocado.  ICK.

All the while the barrage of questions continued \"do you want dinner now? can I show you the desserts?  oh, here are the desserts, why don't you order 3-4?' on and on and on

My advice....mediocre food and wait staff that won't leave you alone.  Skip it."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, service was poor. Server didn't bring what was asked for and tried to charge us for an appetizer we didn't order. He didn't seem to care about our dining experience which is unfortunate when spending $50 for lunch (without any alcohol). Don't think we'll go back. True Food is so close and SO much better!"}
{"text":"My dear friend treated me to a Retirement Celebration yesterday and our experience at Seasons 52 was extraordinary!  We had the ultimate server- Ken- who was informative about menu choices, intuitive about dietary restrictions (my pal is a Vegan), an absolute delight and catered to our every need.  We toasted with a lovely bottle of Cava and paired it with a Tomato Flatbread that was crisp and light- perfect for a hot summer day.  My friend ordered the delectable Vegetable platter and I selected the special- a Copper River Salmon with corn risotto and asparagus- both recommended by Ken.  All I can say is mmmmmm.....delish!  We couldn't say no to dessert and indulged in the individual Chocolate Peanut Butter Parfait.  No matter the \"season\"- whether a 115 degree summer day or a crisp fall day- I am sold on Seasons 52.  Ask for Ken- he will make sure your dining experience is truly a treat!"}
{"text":"This place is great. A nice restaurant in the Biltmore area where everything is under 500 calories - but doesn't taste like it? What's not to like?

I've only been here two times, but each experience has been great! I ate at the bar about a year ago and had delicious salmon during a dinner date. I went back last week with a girlfriend for a lunch and had the blackened fish tacos - amazing!

Considering I live and work down the street from here, I need to come here more often! Great place for business lunches and dinner dates."}
{"text":"Its a good place if you are not vegetarian. For vegetarians, options are limited and alright."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and they have a number of creative choices for me on a dedicated vegetarian menu. I had Cedar Plank Roasted Tofu with Carrots and Roasted Red Potatoes and it was very good. The tofu came with a mango/jalapeño chutney that spiced up the tofu nicely without being too hot. Service was attentive. I will say that at 6:45 on a Wednesday evening the place was packed - and quite noisy to the point where it was difficult to carry on a conversation. By 7:30, the bar crowd had thinned out and the noise level was acceptable."}
{"text":"Went here for my 27th birthday. Wow it was amazing!!!!!

The atmosphere is amazing. Relaxing and very elegant.
The service is top notch!!! Incredible .. Our server brett was fab!!! 

The food is to die for. From beginning to end it was so amazing

Overall it was a great experience. Prices arent that bad for the quality you get. I really loved it 

Thank you seasons 52 for making my birthday special. We will be back soon:)"}
{"text":"I've been twice and admit that several of my friends said their seafood dishes here have been great.  The wait staff has been eager, but somewhat unskilled.  They lack substantive knowledge of their wine and food.  The food itself has been mediocre.  I had the tofu platter once, figuring that a place billing itself as a healthful restaurant would pay particular attention to this darling of vegetarians.  It was painfully tasteless.  I had a turkey kebab on my second visit that was better but certainly didn't bowl me over."}
{"text":"Great concept for dining out - every dish under 475 calories all made with seasonal ingredients! I had reservations but was told it would be a few minutes or choose open seating at the bar. We opted for the bar and turns out the live piano player and her beautiful voice were a perfect complement to our meal. 

The food was fresh, tasty, and beautifully presented. I had the lemongrass salmon salad. The lettuce is placed in a glass cylinder which is removed once the dish is placed in front of you. The moist and flaky salmon filet was cooked with a piece of lemongrass through it. The ahi tuna salad also received good reviews. The wine list was so-so. Anytime you put that a wine is from California but doesn't state where in California, I'm a bit suspicious.
 
But the BEST part of the meal had to be the dessert portion of the menu. All seven mini-indulgences are actually presented to you at the table and you can choose directly from the selection. Each mini dessert comes in what looks like a double shot glass so it's only a few bites but since I lack a real sweet tooth, it's just the right amount. And if you can spare the calories, you can order a few different selections as I saw other diners doing. Our choices: the chocolate peanut butter mousse (FANTASTIC!!) and the carrot cake. 

Our server, Hillary B., was friendly and knowledgeable and even has her own business cards! Overall, a great place to for a pleasant, healthy meal (as long as you don' t order multiple courses and glasses of wine). Would love it if this chain comes to the Bay Area sometime soon."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe that some of these choices are under 475 calories, but I prefer to believe it so I will enjoy eating them.  I just had the Summer Salad (tomato & mozzarella) for the 3rd time this week.  (I tend to fixate on one thing, I admit.)  Seating in the bar area is open, and there's one pianist or another there to entertain.  I tend to like the quieter ones.  A fun place to eat!"}
{"text":"Delicious! My husband and I are in town for Dodger spring training and decided to come here for dinner because it was across the street from our hotel. The ambiance was perfect, I enjoyed the piano player. We started with a mozzarella and lobster flatbread, so good! For my main course I had a perfectly seasoned branzino. Best fish ever; with potatoes and veggies. Yum. My husband had grilled shrimp and risotto. The shrimp tasted like Cajun without the hot spice. I enjoy myself some spice but it was still wonderful. Then for dessert we sampled the chocolate and peanut mousse cup and a lemon cup. Perfect end. On top of that we had some great glasses of wine and a pomegranate martini. The night was made even better by our great waiter Tony B.  We'd highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So many edits to this review! The roller coaster of emotions from misinformation.... I do hope the soup was made with vegetable broth! No other complaints. Thanks for the response."}
{"text":"Had family in for Christmas and New Years, grand time had by all!  So on the following weekend it was a little quality time for Diana and I that included dinner at Seasons 52.  We went back and forth between Beckets and 52 with Seasons wining out. Why you may ask, I'll tell you in a story.  A couple of years ago we had the pleasure of attending the Indy 500 and stayed in Carmel, Indiana.  We were with a group and had dinner that evening at Seasons 52 there.  The fun part was we had a special guest Patrick Dempsey, that's right McDeamy himself! Needless to say this made for the best evening ever, he was easy going, gracious and concerned about our environment. 
The meal was great that evening and again this evening.  We had a nice cabernet to enjoy while we reminisced our previous Seasons 52 visit and recounting the wonderful visit from family.  Entrée's included Sea bass and Scallops. The sea bass was perfectly prepared, buttery delicious with crispy edges and the same can be said for the scallops.  The scallops were crusted on the edges and succulent inside.  Both entrees' portion sizes were surprising generous. We capped dinner off with cappuccino and desert.  The desert shot glasses filled Smore, Key lime pie and Macchiato delights were simply the best!  
What can I say; a cozy restaurant, good service and delicious food made for an evening that will be repeated.  Seasons 52, I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner. The minute we walked in we were greeted and seated right away ( made reservations ahead) 
Our waitress made our first experience incredible. The food was absolutely delicious, I recommend getting the pomegranate margarita martini. I had the Mediterranean braised lamb shank, hands down the best lamb I had. For dessert I had the raspberry chocolate chip cannoli. 
We will definitely come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere! My only complaint is that the sides were mediocre and lacked flavor. The mashed potatoes tasted like soup and the vegetables were hard.  The lobster tail, roasted chicken, and rack of lambs are to die for!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and healthy.  Every item is less than 475 calories, but my wife and I were both still content after dining. Atmosphere is upscale; prices are high but not unreasonable ($15/person/lunch). 

Overall, it was a wonderful experience that we'll be enjoying again."}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town and wanted to get a good healthy meal without having to pay a fortune.

We ended up here after looking up their menu and seeing the great options and the cherry on top was that every dish is under 500 calories. 

I had the scallops with lemon risotto and it was terrific. Large serving of scallops and asparagus and a good amount of risotto. Flavors were deep and we'll thought out. My wife had the filet and again the protein and vegetables were great portions and the steak was cooked perfectly.

In the end we tried to skip dessert but were talked into the small plate desserts and they did not dissapoint. 

Overall it was very good and reasonably priced. Would definitely go back while here or other locations."}
{"text":"I dined here last night for my 33rd birthday and I was impressed!!  Everything was outstanding and healthy to boot!  I had the Wild Copper River salmon and it was delicious.  My Mom and Dad both had the lamb chops and they were so good they wanted to order more!!  The individual portioned desserts were just right and a great ending to our meal.  Service was great and I'm so glad I picked this place for my birthday dinner!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I wish there were a branch of this fabulous chain in Cleveland!  Seek them out wherever you are!  The under 475 calorie deal on everything brings you in and the food keeps you coming back!  Salads - entrees - the four-bite desserts - sigh wonderful.  We sat on the patio and it was like a little vacation in itself."}
{"text":"I came for a lunch meeting. The atmosphere is quite nice for a meeting as it's quiet and somewhat secluded. I ordered the crab cake sandwich with potato salad. The crab cake sandwich was great. The potato salad was pretty bland. I think it was just a cooked potato, that's all I could taste. I'd try it again but I'd definitely look for a different side. One of the people with me had a side salad and it looked good and was huge, I'll try that next time."}
{"text":"Lamb - first is overdone and second is rare. No rye in the bar. Generally the good thing about the place is the appropriate portions. They do a great job with that. I think it is a great place for a lunch. Been here a dozen times - and think it is ok but not spectacular.  Think of it as an upscale sizzler."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The service and food is consistently good and the atmosphere is nice when I'm looking for a little quieter spot for lunch or drinks/dinner.  The young woman who plays piano is awesome!"}
{"text":"It's been a wonderful experience each time I've lunch or dinner here at Seasons 52. I love how the menu changes with each season and it is a great place to go when I am eating healthy, I don't ever feel guilty for the food I eat and I can maintain a good calorie count. When I celebrated my birthday and my cousin's birthday, the chef came out to tell us happy birthday each time and asked us how our food was. The service I've been receiving over the years definitely makes me want to return."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how impressed I am that this place delivers as consistently as it does for 1) being a chain 2) changing the menu as often as it does and 3) for promising all entrees under 500 cals. 

I took my dad here for an early Father's Day, and he loved it. Around the table, we had trout, the 3-week seasonal salmon, scallops and chicken. I would recommend all of them. The portions were larger than I expected, but I was filled just to the brim of my appetite. 

Their happy hour goes until 6:30, and during that time you can get $4 beers and some yummy lamb and (I believe) pork lollipops. Get them.

Service was on point- timely, polite and unpretentious. It's a nice, slightly less expensive alternative to Hillstone."}
{"text":"This place is our favorite! They have amazing food, and take great care of my GLUTEN ALLERGIC wife. We both ate gluten free and you'd never know it. 
Flatbreads are awesome, the filet, and pork tenderloin are outstanding! My favorite desert (not gluten free) is the pecan tart. 
Jordan was very attentive and made made our anniversary so memorable. We will be back, for sure."}
{"text":"The best Chicken Salad ever! I have had many in my time but this one was over the top!
Their little tiny dessert samplers are divine.
Service was excellent!
We had the lamb flat bread, it was good but not the best I've ever had
Overall all it was a very nice experience and I can't wait to go back and try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"It was surprisingly busy when I first arrived on a rainy Wednesday evening. I didn't have a reservation and the restaurant was fully committed so the hostess mentioned there was open seating in the bar area. Perfect, I grabbed the last booth available. I waited for 10 minutes with servers constantly walking by me, I made eye contact with the bartender several times and I didn't even get acknowledged much less a glass of water. After waiting another few minutes my friend got up and grabbed a wine list from the bar. We had to go BACK to the bartender to ask a server to come over and take our drink order. I was really disappointed, I get better service at Applebee's. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Took my dad here for lunch on Father's Day with the the family. It wasn't really busy at the time we went, which was perfect since there were a few of us. The lighting inside the restaurant was a bit on the darker side for my liking, but it was still nice and cool. We were greeted right away by our server who was amazing the entire time! Great, great service :)!

I ordered the wood grilled filet mignon which came with asparagus and mashed potatoes. The filet was decent but the mashed potatoes were kind of runny. They weren't good at all so that was a bit disappointing. I also ordered a sparkling raspberry lemonade but I couldn't taste much of the raspberry in it. Overall, I didn't think the meal was worth the cost.

I did try some of my mother's dish which was a lobster flatbread and that was pretty delicious! Our waiter also gave us free dessert for Father's Day which was very nice of him!"}
{"text":"Great service, comfortable atmosphere, wonderful food.  This was our first time here, and we were very pleased. The menu offered a good variety in every category. The service was friendly and efficient. Our waitress, Andrea, was delightfully friendly and good natured. All the elements of a great evening out!"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food. Usually get the trout but other items are great as well. You can get dessert without feeling guilty with low calorie dinners and a shot glass sized dessert. Mmmm."}
{"text":"While golfing with Phoenix locals I asked where they would go for a special dinner, and all 3 immediately replied \"Seasons 52.\" That kind of endorsement suggests either a spectacular experience in the making or a set up for a major let down. I'm very pleased to say our experience was off the spectacular end of the chart. 

Everything - and I do mean every single thing - exceeded expectations, from the hostess who booked and confirmed our reservation to the valet parking to the ambiance to our server Brittany to the food itself. The chef recently changed to the Autumn menu, and it was superbly balanced and prepared. We started with the three mushroom flatbread which was a delicious treat for all four of us. For mains we had the scallops, salmon, shrimp and grits, and lamb shank. All of us were highly satisfied with the quality, quantity and presentation of our dishes. My wife even commented she would've been OK with a couple less scallops. Afterward we indulged in five different desserts, with the key lime and pumpkin-gingersnap shots standing out.

Our tab for four, including drinks, gratuity and tax was about $200. We aren't in a tax bracket which allows us to splurge like this all the time, but I would much rather pay more for a superior experience than less for mediocrity. Most importantly, it passed our \"Would you come back here again?\" test by a unanimous vote.

Thank you Seasons 52!"}
{"text":"I had the cedar plank salmon with seasonal vegetables and the butternut squash soup. The portion size was just enough and the favors delicious. The salmon not over or under cooked. The atmosphere is good for a romantic dinner or dinner with friends. Our server Josh was engaging and attentive."}
{"text":"We were told there was a 2 hour wait when we arrived. We went to the bar and checked Open
Table for other options and to our surprise, we got a reservation here for 10 minutes later. They came for us in 5 minutes. Hmm."}
{"text":"A beautiful Friday afternoon at the Biltmore Fashion Park . . . we're hungry! Do we go for decadence at the Cheesecake Factory or healthy food at True Foods . . . aah, we spot Seasons 52, and I look it up on Yelp! Great reviews so we decided to give it a whirl! 

The patio, although small, was just perfect . . . intimate and comfortable. It is set away from the parking lot, so you don't feel like you are at a big shopping center patio with cars and fumes passing by. 

I love that every menu item is under 475 calories, and they all sound interesting. My dining companion ordered the Farmer's Market Vegetable Plate with spring snap peas, grilled ponzu tofu and toasted almond tabbouleh. The tofu was yum! Even more yum was the tabbouleh with its mildly sweet taste. I could have eaten that just as my meal. I ordered the day's special flatbread -- Smoked Scottish Salmon with creme fresch. It was delicious and huge. I don't know how it came in under 475 calories, but if they say so, who am I to question it. The flatbread is about 5 x 13, plenty to share, so I ended up just eating the smoked salmon and leaving a good portion of the flatbread. 

The service we received was outstanding! Our waiter was very patient with me as it takes me a long time to make up my mind, especially when I haven't had a chance to peruse a menu in advance of going somewhere. I'm always the one who says, \"take everyone else's order first and come back to me\" and often, I still haven't made up my mind . . . 

As much as it pains my wallet to have to go to Biltmore Fashion Park to shop (hee hee hee), I think I can now find another reason to head in that direction. More importantly, I will have to find someone to go with me who will share one or two of their Mini Indulgences for dessert, but again, I'll have a hard time making up my mind which flavor. Aah, if life's problems were only that simple! 

Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"We had soft tacos for lunch! Duck and Mahi Mahi with quino salad. This is a great place for lunch and I recommend it. The summer menu is lite and fun."}
{"text":"Very pleasant dining experience. I came here for Arizona week and what a treat! The servings were scrumptious and filling. Just the scallop entree filled me up! I will come back again, worth the drive from Gilbert!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food selection under  500 calories, desserts were tastey and service was outstanding.  Definitely recommend this new restaurant to others, however wish they had happy hour!"}
{"text":"I like this place because of the shot glass desserts! Yes and all the fresh seasonal good! Service was informative, friendly and personal."}
{"text":"Great evening! Food was quick and perfectly cooked. Our Tempranillo was nice and spicy and paired perfectly with the venison.  Tony B. was extremely professional and knowledgable about the food. 
Great evening! Ask for Tony when you come by!"}
{"text":"High-end dining with a healthy spin that doesn't sacrifice flavor or quality.

My friend and I dined here during happy hour on a Friday evening.  This spot gets drastically busier around 6 pm.

Chyna was our server and she was welcoming and kind to us.  I ordered a pineapple Cosmo which came with an extra shaker- easily 2 drinks in 1.  Super dangerous... Also only $8 on hh, normally $12 I believe.

I tried 2 happy hour plates:  grilled chicken skewers with grilled pineapple and shrimp scampi.  I highly recommend the chicken which includes 4 skewers with mainly chicken and pineapple basted in a Hawaiian tropical sauce- loving it!!!!  The shrimp scampi was only ok ok flavor for me but was atop a bruschetta to absorb the sauce.

We ran out of time to order dessert though the mini indulgences are outstanding!

I like counting my calories and staying within 1300-1500 a day and seasons makes this possible while having a social life.  All the calories are printed on the menu and they rotate menus seasonally.

*The main reason for my 5 star review is the integrity of the employees. I left my Jimmy Choo sunglasses in the booth and Jen the manager, kept them aside for me when I called 10 minutes after leaving.  The hostess Kim also helped my friend charge her phone on a separate occasion.   

As a boutique manager in the mall, I will be sending my customers to Seasons 52!"}
{"text":"Great place great food. It was my second time dining here last night, I took a friend for her birthday and she was very pleased with the set up and her thia steak salad which I tried aswell and it was pretty tasty. I had no clue what I wanted or had a craving for but are AWESOME WAITER \"TOMMY\" said he'd surprise me and brought out the sea bass which was to die for I can't wait for the next time I dine at season 52 :) we also had a cauliflower app that was very tasty aswell.  Two thumbs up for food and the great service!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently started a very strict, low-calorie diet so we were really excited when we heard about this place!! I had previewed the menu online so we had an idea beforehand of what to expect and the food did end up being very good!!  We only got to try the salads with grilled chicken but it was still very good.  Everything else on the menu sounded delicious!! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they didn't list the calories on the menu or have a list available.......I would have loved to see this.  Honestly with all the hype for the 475 calories & under I expected to be able to ACTUALLY see the calories somewhere on the menu.   The only other thing that was slightly annoying was the server didn't seem to be toatally up to speed on the menu but again this would have been solved by simply just listing the calories....she was VERY polite and attentive otherwise. :)    

I do have to mention that the interior of this restaurant is very elegant and comfortable.  It's a very large place but still manages to feel cozy from your table.  We sat in the dining room but we could see through to the bar and it looked beautiful!! Plus they have a piano player BEHIND the bar--very cool!!  We were also pleasantly surprised at how fairly everything was priced....I mean in a world where you can go next door and get a (nearly) $20 plate of  squash (no thank you True Food) it's so great to find a place that doesn't rake you over the coals.  We will definitely be going back here soon to try some of the other things on the menu!! I can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Food was overpriced and not very good. I was disappointed with my dinner for what you pay, I would go somewhere else in the area, there are lots of options around there. Good location and service just not the greatest food for the price."}
{"text":"Love, love Seasons 52 ... but ... the new menu for spring came out and on the Happy Hour menu they switched the lamb chops to lamb loin ... no no no ... go back the the lamb chop please !!!!  So much better."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, got the lollipop lamb chops and they were not as good as expected. Chewy and stringy lamb. Service was average, to under performing. I would not recommend based on price, service and overall quality of food."}
{"text":"Came here for my 19th birthday and i loved it everyone was welcoming the food was amazing need i say more !"}
{"text":"the food is pretty good and the waitress are very sweet and kind . We went for a graduation dinner and they gave us desert and card and everything . The place is nice and I would recommend."}
{"text":"We confess, we love Season's and search them out while traveling so we expected a good experience. Our server Sunday night made our meal so much more memorable. Attention to every detail was her forte, and she topped our evening off with a celebration dessert. Our meal was delicious, my martini perfectly chilled, her wine suggestion was right on target. When back in town, we'll visit again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My husband and I came today for dinner. We shared the crab cake and a pesto chicken flatbread as appetizers. For dinner, I got the Braised Short Rib over Cheese Grits and he got the Lamb shank. The food was delicious! My Braised Short Rib was boneless and literally so tender and moist that it fell apart at the touch of my fork. Im not usually a fan of grits but our waitress Sakura highly recommended them and I am now a believer! My husband raved about his Lamb shank. All of our food arrived quickly, still hot and smelling delicious. The dessert assortment conpleted the meal. I opted for the mocha with chocolate cake and my hubby got the carrot cake. They were good to the last bite. We had the pleasure of having Sidney (another member of staff) come and speak to us. We csme in to celebrate 1 and 1/2 years of marriage and Sidney commented on our playfulness and congratulated us by bringing us a rose. Stellar service and visit overall. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has fast become a favorite of mine.  They have a great Happy Hour, with $5 small plates that are very generously portioned.  The presentation of everything here is impressive and service is consistently excellent. 
The flatbreads are very popular and provide some great combinations, I like the steak and blue cheese flatbread which is easily a meal.
Save room for dessert, the mini desserts they present and explain are amazing, every one my guests or I have tried has been scrumptious.
I look forward to my next dinner there."}
{"text":"So so good I had to go back 2 nights in a row! Everything was so exceptional, food, service, ambience...everything! Don't know how I missed it before. I opt to sit by the bar top.
I had the sea bass n a glass of white wine, both superb recommendations by the tall bartender I forgot to look at his name. Everything was so good I went back tonight and had exactly the same things and adding caramelized scallops. I was too full for dessert,  but will have to next time. They have lots of regulars. Nice to see that. Great great service."}
{"text":"I've been trying GF (gluten free) places lately and this one has a whole menu dedicated for that purpose. 

The food was actually very good and the service was outstanding. Fernando was the waiter and he did a great job! 

Lobster spring rolls and filet, can't go wrong, huh?

My only complaint is that I had a reservation and showed up on time, however I had to wait about 20 min to be seated. On top of that, they gave me a buzzer like the ones you get in more casual restaurants. If they appeal to the up-scale crowd I think they should get rid of that waiting buzzer and have the tables ready. 

Cheers"}
{"text":"My BF and I came here for dinner and after learning about their farm fresh ingredients we were told that corn, sugar snap peas, and tomatoes were in season. We ordered the scallops with corn risotto, sugar snap peas, and grape tomatoes. The BF ordered filet mignon with mashed potatoes, sugar snap peas, and grape tomatoes. 

My scallops were cooked perfectly but the sugar snap peas were slightly overcooked. I was really disappointed in the corn risotto because I love corn but the risotto tasted plain and was undercooked (not yet al dente). The BF asked for his filet mignon to be cooked \"rare plus\" (in between rare and medium rare) and it was perfect! His sugar snap peas were still crisp, unlike mine.

After dinner they brought out multiple shot glasses of different yummy desserts and if you want them, you pull them off the plate...that's so sneaky cause they looked SO good I wanted to keep them all! We ended up keeping the crème brûlée, pecan pie, and chocolate-something with a graham cracker sticking out. They were all so delicious! I definitely recommend the crème brûlée and pecan pie, I wanted more of those!

Our waitress, Brooklyn, apologized for the busy night and offered our desserts on the house which was unexpected and super thoughtful of her!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, presentation, ambiance. I highly recommend. My favorite place to eat and enjoy in the Phoenix area. Love your desserts. If I could I would give you 10 stars!"}
{"text":"Wow, came here again with a friend for lunch on Friday.
Excellent service as always!! Lou was our waiter, he was very helpful in all depts.
My friend Kris is very particular about what she eats, so this is a great place for her. They explain everything and can answer every question.
Everything on the menu is low calorie. I got the mushrooms stuffed with shrimp and she got the Ahi tuna salad. Both were awesome.
We also got the artichoke Pizza that was fantastic. 
They refill your drinks continuously and even their water is filtered. You can drink glasses of it without feeling you just poisoned yourself.

The decor is dark wood and I think it is beautiful. They have an awesome little fire place in the front that I just love looking at.
Restrooms are nice and clean, but the water never really got too warm to wash your hands.

Lots of Parking, located in the Biltmore shopping Center/
Also my friend got one of the desserts and she did not like it at all, she thought it was far too sweet, she said she could taste artificial sweetener in it.
Lou was kind enough to take it off the bill.
Awesome place and very healthy!"}
{"text":"I come to the Biltmore for lunch frequently with friends. We finally decided to try this restaurant. First impression is that it has a nice atmosphere inside. Greeted and seated right away. The waiter was ok. He went on so long about the menu that we had to cut him off. He explained the 52 represents the chef changing up some menu items every week (below a patron said it was because of the 52 bottle wine selection - so now I'm confused). We ordered the lamb kabobs and shrimp mushroom appetizers. The stuffed mushrooms were excellent. The lamb kabobs however were pretty bad. They tasted like ground hamburger on a stick with some feta. I cook lamb a lot this just didn't taste good at all. One of my friends ordered the turkey burger, she said that was good and a side of frys. All the sides are ala cart - just a forewarning. I ordered the scallops. They were alright, nothing too rave about. Our waiter never asked us how things were or if we enjoyed our dishes. He scurried the plates away without asking - both the appetizers and the main courses. I wanted to say something about the lamb but thought maybe he was in a hurry. We had to flag him down for the dessert menu. Normally a waiter asks if you want to order dessert - but we asked. He brought an assortment of little glasses filled with a wide variety of desserts. I had a chocolate cake/mousse indulgence as they are called. It was good and you didn't feel too guilty because it was small. I like the idea of this restaurant, everything is 475 calories or less, smaller portions, changing menu but honestly it wasn't memorable. On the way out even the hostess didn't say \"have a nice day\" or \"thank you for coming\". Wasn't a real \"wow\" type of experience. There are a lot of options in the Biltmore area, I don't think I'd go back."}
{"text":"Always enjoy my meal at Seasons 52!  There are always innovative, unique dishes to choose from, and they never disappoint.  I especially love the flatbreads, the salmon dishes, the mushroom appetizer, and the scallops!  The menu is always changing with the season and in this case, change is never a bad thing. The wine selection is great but I tend to order cocktails here. I'm never disappointed!  On my last visit I had the grapefruit martini.. One of my favorite martinis ever! Great place for delicious food and drinks with a intimate, classy atmosphere without feeling stuffy or being ridiculously overpriced"}
{"text":"They had me at \"Hello.\" Seriously, I love a Host Staff that actually looks happy to see me. :) We're off to a great start. The decor is rich and comfortable. 

We dined al fresco. The thick foliage and large stone water-feature provide a private, quasi-resort feel, but the large office buildings in the background remind you that you're Uptown.

Our Server presented their concept. They are a seasonal restaurant and their Menu changes 4 times each year. Currently in their Winter Season, the Spring Menu debuts March 15, 2011. In addition, they have 52 specials each year, and thus the name Seasons 52. She said all the meals are under 450 calories. I'm sure that doesn't include dessert. ;)

Winter Menu Favorites: Spicy Chipotle Shrimp Flatbread with grilled pineapple, Feta cheese and roasted poblano peppers.= AHmazing! The Boyfriend enjoyed the Buffalo Chili. And the One Shot Dessert display for the sweet tooth. Lots of rich decadence in smaller, not too much guilt sized portions for $2.50. 

Posted pics of lunch."}
{"text":"Food was fine, the service -- on a Tuesday night -- was very disappointing. We had to ask three times for water refills, waitress was slow to deliver drinks, she completely forgot a salad that was ordered. Subpar experience; scant reason to return or recommend to others."}
{"text":"Really appreciate the concept here.  The roasted pork with mushrooms was incredibly tender.  The grilled salmon salad lived up to its reputation.  Was underwhelmed by the featured appetizer for that night, a crab & lobster spring roll.  By the end of the meal, the little desserts were the perfect size.

As a choice between this restaurant and True Food Kitchen (marketed with the same concept of good but healthy), I'd choose Seasons 52."}
{"text":"man what happened to you guys I used to come here for lunch a few times a month food was always great and the service was even better but then we started going to Capital Grille so we decided to come here for dinner to save a couple bucks Buy-Back kicked me in the ass first off their service was so slow took forever to get anything couldn't keep water filled had to ask a couple times for silverware just very slow service now for the appetizers crab cake was awesome stuffed mushrooms or horrible shrimpies way over cooked so it was tough and rubbery so not good at all the lamb I had was so full of fat it was barely any edible meat the desserts were very delicious though but in the end shouldn't the capital even though the same company will probably go back for lunch one day maybe they have better Cooks for lunch"}
{"text":"Great food and Service. Server went out if his way when we were having trouble with the sound level of the background music. He actually was able to lower it so we could have an easier conversation. Much appreciated."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Thursday night and immediately found lots of seats at the bar.  Ambiance was nice, not too loud and lighting just right.  Our bartender/server, Tom, was really nice and helpful.  Service was really great.  The food, I wish were better.  For our appetizer, we had the lump crab, roasted shrimp and spinach stuffed mushrooms (230 cal).   The mushrooms were small, bite sized, and the filling was a great harmony of flavors.  For my entree, I ordered the salmon dish, I figured, hey you can't really go wrong with salmon.  The salmon was really bland and I just didn't like the char on it, I guess I didn't enjoy how it was prepared.  The corn risotto it came with was pretty good and the sugar snap peas were cooked in a light manner.  My husband had the Filet and that was just okay, definitely had better but you could tell it was prepared in a less-fattening way.  The mashed potatoes it came with didn't taste as guilt free as the rest of the meal which was nice.  Overall, we really enjoyed the service here, but didn't feel the food lived up to what I was hoping for.  It's a great place to dine if you are keeping a calorie count or dieting without wanting to cut out traditional dishes."}
{"text":"For at least six years now, this has been Ladywife's and my favorite Celebration Spot, because we loved the food, the service, the ambience, the seasonal menu changes, everything. 

BIG disappointment last time we visited, on Saturday November 12, for our mumblety-third Wedding Anniversary. Granted, they'd been busy. But no busier than on many other occasions we've visited,when everything worked just fine, when the service and food were excellent despite the crowded tables. 

This time, even with a reservation, we waited almost half an hour to be seated. Then the service was perfunctory and offhanded. When our food arrived, it was not only relatively tasteless, but poorly presented; slapped on the plate with little thought to appearance. 

While their little \"shot\" style desserts are still delicious, they've been dramatically reduced in number. And they've apparently forgotten how to make an Irish Coffee.

This wasn't the anniversary celebration that -- based on all past experience -- we'd looked forward to. On the way home, we discussed whether or not Seasons 52 would still be our go-to place for maybe 10 visits a year on birthdays and anniversaries, and for entertaining out-of-town friends ... 

... and decided NO. We'll seek out someplace else."}
{"text":"Great food! Nice and fresh! Everything is under 475 calories (and its not ritz cracker-sized portions). Great for drinks as well."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and it was perfect. A little dark but the waiters have small flash lights which was cute and helpful. I started with a glass of the Jolie Gamay, my coworker had an amazing lemon drop. The presentation on everything from the drinks to the food was perfect. We had the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer which was suggested by our server. For my entrée I had the lamb chops with mashed potatoes and vegetables and it was topped with a pomegranate sauce. We finished with individual shot desserts, I had the carrot cake; yum! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came for drinks and food, was interrogated instead.

My girlfriend and I came to Seasons 52 because we had a gift card to various restaurants owned by the same parent company. Boy did we choose wrong! Once we were seated we were immediately greeted by our waitress Alexandra. After going over the menu with us and HER asking US if we would like to start off with some wine, my girlfriend orders a glass and I chose a beer. After being asked for ID (not uncommon, we are 24 & 23 and have been asked hundreds of times) we ran into some problems.

After staring at my ID for what seems like 20 seconds she asks me what my date of birth is... Uhh, it's on the ID, why are you asking me? But I promptly tell her the date. Then she requests the year, I tell her that too. Then she proceeds to ask me \"Do you usually get away with having this kind of ID?\"

I still have the vertical under 21 ID. I later learned after going home and doing my OWN research that as of last week they are no longer accepted for purposes of buying alcohol in AZ. Fair enough, but for some reason the waitress refused to tell us this. She instead asks if we usually get away with this. Really? Yes, we've legally bought alcohol the past three years and \"gotten away with it\". No, we have not \"usually gotten away with\" buying alcohol the past 9 days when this law was enacted. 

Please, your in the service industry. The obvious way to handle this situation is apologize and inform your customers. That is common sense, but apparently customer service at Seasons 52 is defined by treating your customers like idiotic plebs because two young looking college graduates who have full time salary positions don't know about the changes made in YOUR industry last week.

After being talked down to and staring at my ID for another minute she then proceeds to ask for my girlfriends ID. She also still has the vertical \"under 21 until\". She then requests some other form of identification from her, but didn't from me... WHAT?! We are looking at each other in shock at this point and are exasperated. We ask what she could possibly want that is more proving of our age than our State ID. She asks for a credit card! There is no date of birth on a credit card! She then thanks us and says \"sorry but it's our policy\".

First off, no it's not your policy, it's now the state law, secondly, the law states that \"under 21\" ID is only accepted now with a passport, other state issued ID after the the person has turned 21, or a military ID. Not a credit card! So while Alexandra talked down to us like this law has been in place the past 100 years, she didn't even follow the procedures herself, and in turn, broke the law! Kind of ironic, huh? Pro-tip, you're in the wrong industry if you get off on talking down to people because you found out something before them. You're suppose to know the new laws and inform your customers, not us. People who succeed in the customer service industry get personal enjoyment on creating great experiences and making people's days. I couldn't help but feel like she was getting personal enjoyment on harassing us instead.

The place was really nice inside, can't speak on the food or drinks though because we walked out after that initial encounter. With how blatantly rude she was to our face we didn't want to take the chance on actually consuming something from them."}
{"text":"The Lobster soup is amazing!!!!  The scallops were also perfect. Great place for a work lunch!!!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the scallops as recommended by our waiter. They were the very best I have had in years . Served Sitting on a bed of yummy risotto with fresh green beans - will definitely return. Service was above and beyond."}
{"text":"Lunch was not that good, even after the weekend crowd had left. The waiter constantly trying to UP sell EVERYTHING! Stop!!! Do not order the seafood paella. The portion is a joke, and cost outrageous. The salmon salad ok, at best. The waiter so dang aggressive with up selling, he ignored request for dressing on the side. Then tried to say another waiter took my dressing free salad. I looked around the empty restaurant and knew this was a lie. Unfortunately this lunch left a lot to desired, resulting in afternoon cheese board and wine at home. Never again....too many other tastier and budget friendly choices. Nothing special being in the Biltmore, Seasons."}
{"text":"We had reservations for 10 at 8:30pm on a saturday and were seated promptly. Drink orders were taken but didn't arrive for about 20 minutes. It was another 30 mins for our food to arrive after that. Everyone had a hard time reading the menus due to the low lighting, and were all in our 30's. I think everyone was happy with their meal but not overly excited about it.  Prices were reasonable though. We were never offered a second round of drinks and only saw our server briefly after our food arrived.  Everyone's glasses were empty half way through the meal which was pretty disappointing. We tried to get her attention but to no avail. I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome Healthy menu! The staff is awesome making sure you have a great dining experience. I would definitely recommend Seasons 52 to anyone looking for great food and a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Seasons 52 is one of my favorite places in the Biltmore/Central Phoenix area for a \"wine\" happy hour.  In fact, I think it's one of THEE best wine happy hours on this side of town. I had a few cocktails before, they were only OK.  I'll forever stick with the wine selections and sangrias and I recommend everyone to do the same.  I've been to Seasons52 for Happy Hour more times than I can count, I've only had dinner twice.  It's such a spacious place, an awesome place to host large parties.  I've personally hosted two Happy Hour meet ups for wo different groups.  Both parties said nothing but great things about the service, the quality and quantity of the food and the wine selection for Happy Hour.  

My reasons behind the 4 star review instead of the 5 star review goes a little something like this:
1. The cocktails aren't that good ... which is okay because again the wine selections are great!  Occasionally though I like to have a really good Bourbon or Port for dessert.  I haven't had either here yet
2. I LOVE dessert, full size, grown up ones.  They only have cute little sample size desserts.  I've tried them all, every single one ... they're good.  I just wish they came in a full size as an option. 
3. Again, I've had Seasons 52 for HH more times than I can count.  I've only have dinner twice.  Once on a solo date and I ordered the shrimp scampi and Rainbow Trout and 2 glasses of whatever wine the waitress recommended.  I enjoyed my dinner but I remember I ended up getting that entrée because they were out of whatever it was I initially wanted to order.  I enjoyed that dinner so much that months later I decided to host my birthday dinner for 5 there.  My party of 5 didn't enjoy the dinning experience.  Just about everything someone ordered, they were out of.  It was a Friday evening around 7.  That was pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch. The food was fantastic the service was good. I would definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"This restaurant was excellent.  I attended last night with a few friends and was very pleased with the wine list, and food selection. The service was great and the atmosphere was friendly and busy.   Having a restaurant that is conscious of serving healthy food (within a calorie range) is definitely appealing to the guest and the food selection was outstanding.  I appreciated the change of the menu and wide variety of options. 

I was a little disappointed they didn't have a happy hour menu, but there were some very good wines that were priced reasonable."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the small plate appetizer with scallops, delicious.  Happy hour served until 6:30 p.m.Had a coupon for a flat bread that wasn't great but okay.  Then we ordered, the trout, salmon salad, and tuna salads which were all delicious. Finished our meal with a decadent dessert!  It was just the right size for sweetness. Presentation was impressive, service was right on and atmosphere was comforting and contemporary.  Loved going early for dinner, good time to chat with a group of people.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Well, I'm rather perplexed by the star rating.  The food was good, the service was ok, the ambiance was again, just ok.  

The prices were good, the location is good and the decor was nice.  If the calories really are what they claim to be then I'm impressed by the flavor per calorie content but I find it hard to believe...? 

There were some awkward moments such as the customer who was yelling at the wait staff for not having a table for them.  The waitress who was too present at the start - trying to take our food before we were finished and then who disappeared when we were waiting for the check.  

Nothing was bad, but definitely just an A-OK from me on this joint.  I recommend the tacos and the flat breads.  Both rather filling and pretty tasty."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our meal here- from the appetizers to the dessert. We sat outside on the very comfortable patio, on a gorgeous, warm evening. Our service was excellent, which made our experience even better. Attentive and friendly, with great recommendations on her favorites! We had a party of 4, and each one of us were talking about our meal the next day. Will definitely be back next time we are visiting Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"From the time we walked in the door until we left, we couldn't have had better service! Our waiter, Lou, was extremely helpful, as it was our first visit to Seasons 52. We decided to order 3 appetizers, as it was early in the evening and a full meal didn't appeal to either myself or my husband. Good choice! We loved all three things that we ordered: lamb skewers, flatbread with lamb and feta cheese and finally, stuffed mushrooms with crabmeat and spinach. Delish!!

Loved the outdoor dining option. A lovely courtyard with flowers and privacy from the parking lot....something you don't find too often in a \"mall\" restaurant.

We will be returning to Seasons 52 in the future..."}
{"text":"Yum! Flight and flatbread deal is awesome! Great happy hour, scallops were amazing. How have I not been here before? I wish I lived closer I'd be there all the time!"}
{"text":"I have hosted many meetings and events at this location. The food is always wonderful, they cater to the pickiest eater and the drinks are awesome. The location is convenient to the Biltmore which gives it the extra star."}
{"text":"To be or not to be healthy, that is the question in this review.  The food I had was very good.  The place was packed for lunch and our service was descent.  The ambiance was ok.  I had the fish tacos for under 475 calories and an ice tea.  Now, do I want to spend $20 for a lunch that I could probably do at home.  I don't think so.  All the dishes use your typical flavor enhancers like some kind of hot or garlic when you can't add the \"good\" stuff like butter, cream, and cheese!  I think if I am going to go healthier when eating out I would prefer to go to True Foods or just go to a place I love and order better.  This place will make it b/c its location is perfect for the person lunching several times a week and trying to be healthy.  I would not mind going back, it just would not be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"This is an excellent, beautifully appointed restaurant restaurant . If you are counting calories, all dishes have the caloric count after its description. They have everything from flatbreads, fancy appetizers, and entrees to drool over. Steaks, fish, etc. and an extensive wine list. The little desserts are ver, very good!"}
{"text":"WOW is all I have to say the food the atmosphere is outstanding, the service excellent, wait staff first rate, the food there is something for everybody... We will be going back.. The ceder plank salmon melted in my mouth, by far the best salmon I have ever had."}
{"text":"The most wonderful experience. My partner and I celebrated our first anniversary here. They surprised us with free deserts and champagne. Additionally we got to our table with a flower and a letter from management congratulating us on our first year together and letting us keep our wine glasses. Included inside was a coupon for a free appetizer on a future visit. Staff was amazing and very attentive. Food was great with good options. They truly made our night special!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my favorites! I had the salmon and it was delicious! Customer service was excellent and the food came out quick! I would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"The place is fine.  The mixed greens salad with seared ahi was very good.  Service was very good.  I am in more disagreement with the under 500 calorie deal.  I do not want limitations in my food.  Whatever I am in the mood for, I should have choice.  No limitations."}
{"text":"As always Seasons is superb - trout - excellent - pork tenderloin - the best - salmon - wonderful - tuna salad - better than all the rest - and try the pineapple Cosmo - yum yum!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with Seasons 52. Although it is a chain I found it to be very good. The service was fantastic and the food was very fresh. All of the dishes are even under 500 calories how could you go wrong with that? I had the filet. It was perfectly prepared. My friend had the cheese grits and he said that he loved it! Also the mini deserts were excellent. All in all this place is great. I will be coming back the next time that I am in Phoenix. Wish they had one in Tulsa."}
{"text":"It is your average restaurant with average food.  Nice location and attractive setting.  Had
Burgers with a salad.  Burgers were under seasoned but cooked medium rare.  With a little more seasoning, the burgers would have been excellent because the quality of the meat was very good.  Salads, which included a sprinkling of pepitas were good.  Tried a few of the desserts, including a pumpkin flavored one,but we found them all to be too sweet.  
Service was good."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on a first date.  Great ambiance.   Low lighting, the customers were not loud, almost to a murmur allowing us to actually hear each others conversations.  Parking is validated for 2 hours.  There are 2 lots just south of the restaurant at the Biltmore.

She ordered the Wood-Roasted Pork Tenderloin off of the gluten free menu.  She liked it a lot.  I ordered the seasonal rock fish snapper with curry sauce.   I asked for the curry to be on the side thinking it was spicy.  The fish was tender, not a lot of seasoning, which is the way fish is supposed to be enjoyed.  The sauce was not at all spicy so I used it for some added flavor.  String beans, yellow squash, carrots, onions, and basmati (brown rice).  It was delicious.

The service was great. Linda was her name, older lady who always stopped by to ask how we were doing.  She didn't treat me like a total newbie because I've never been there.  Even though we skipped appetizers, any of the wines, she didn't treat us any different.  She brought a tray of desserts, I got the seasonal Pumpkin Pie with Ginger Snap Crust.  Small portion, but very tasteful not too sweet.  She ordered the Raspberry Chocolate Chip Cannoli.  She discarded the gluten Cannoli part.

Overall, it was a great atmosphere.  It was a casual dining experience without the pressure to order things.  Of course more importantly, the not too skimpy but not too overbearing dishes were delicious.

Dinner - 2 entrees, 2 desserts plus taxes: ticket $48.  Not too bad."}
{"text":"Great food that is good for you.  Excellent service and ambiance.  You would never know it is good for you until you find out that there is nothing over 475 calories.  They also have an extensive wine list.  I love their little desserts. I wish they still had live music.  Try their flights and flatbread."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a business lunch yesterday and the crab wedge salad is an instant favorite of mine.  The portion size was perfect.  The flavors of the dressing made me want to lick my empty plate!  I plan to enjoy lunch here more often and look forward to a dinner date with my husband here soon.  Excellent location, very nice atmosphere, and the wait staff were top notch."}
{"text":"My mother-n-law has been wanting my wife and I to go with her to this restaurant for some time, so with other family members in town we all had dinner here.  The wait wasn't too bad and the food was really good.  The coffee is a tad bit too strong for me, which kept me up most of the night.  It was too dark to even see the menu so we all had our cell phone flashlights on.  Over all it was okay.  It came to about $27.00 per person, which is more about location than anything else.  Its a good place for a once a year meal."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great atmosphere.   Jason our server was great.    Will return especially for happy hour.   Goat cheese appetizer was my favorite thing I tried this trip."}
{"text":"i think my lunch salad was made last night, it had no dressing and i waited 25 minutes to be seated. i'm all set. the only neat thing is every dish is under 475 calories. good concept, but it falls short. really, really short."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, and have never really had any complaints.  The food always tastes fresh and flavorful, and I've never left feeling overly stuffed (like on the verge of passing out!) - which is a very good thing!  I've particularly liked the fish entrees (salmon and rainbow trout).  And the desserts are great - the perfect size to polish off a tasty meal.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Every time we've gone here, both the food and service has been phenomenal. I love that they change their menu weekly, hence the name seasons 52 (52 weeks in a year, get it?). Their butternut squash soup was so good. They are located next to capital grille, the Union (which now is torn down and going to be Sephora! Hooray!)."}
{"text":"Ambiance was great and the service was outstanding by Kimberly. We had a few cocktails before dinner which were made very well. I got the strawberry coconut skinny drink which had enough for two drinks. Yay! We were disappointed with the quality of food though. The lamb was tougher than it should be and the lobster was quite dry. Overall not the best for the price. We are huge foodies and this was disappointing since it got great  reviews.  We came to celebrate a birthday and each got to pick from their 9 desserts. I got the pecan pie which tasted amazing. Don't think we will be back unfortunately since the service was so good."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Top end fish restaurant in the desert! Great customer service and delicious foods!"}
{"text":"Had a really good meal. The waitstaff was great, took the time to explain the concept and choices and made sure my GF needs were met.
The food was really good and all under 475 cals each. I had the BBQ Chicken Salad that came out in a neat presentation, with a nice portion of chicken, lettuce, blue cheese, and a flavorful light dressing. My guests were very happy with their dishes. One had the fish tacos the other had a crab and shrimp stuffed in a mushroom cap.
We sat outside and loved the meal. Good place to go for lunch when at the mall or working close."}
{"text":"Excellent is all I can say.  Visiting Phoenix an was wandering by and decided to stop in for a bite and some wine.  

Sat on the patio and had one of the best afternoon lunches. Emily H.  was a shining star with excellent service, suggestions and personality.  Will make this a stop next time we are in Phoenix and will visit the Costa Mesa location when we return home."}
{"text":"My husband & I ate here last night to celebrate Valentines Day. Our reservation was at 6:30pm on Saturday. We arrived 10 minutes early which I'm glad we did as they became extremely busy. The staff handled it well & we were seated only a few minutes after our reservation. Even though they were packed we were taken to a smaller back room which was quiet & intimate, perfect for a date! Our waiter, Russ, attended to us right away & we were never left waiting. He was actually the highlight of the experience! Very warm, kind & he made us feel like we were his only table. Usually when a place is swamped, people can seem flustered, he showed known of that. Great job, Russ! We started with the Artisan Cheese Fondue Appetizer which was tasty but a little small. While waiting for a our main dishes, we were brought a small bite from the kitchen of something special the chef had made (I can't remember what it was, sorry). Then our wonderful food came! My husband ordered the Wood-Grilled Flat Iron Steak Salad & I got the Wood-Grilled Boneless Rainbow Trout. Nothing disappointed, even the portions! It's rare my husband says his food is better than \"ok\" & surprisingly he called this \"good\"! For dessert they bring a plate of 7 different shot like glasses (on the taller side) for you to choose exactly which ones you want. We got 3! Pecan Pie, Belgian Chocolate S'more & Raspberry Chocolate Chip Cannoli. They were, in one word, amazing! Thanks for a lovely Valentines dinner!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome dining experience. Food and service were beyond expectations. I recommend the lobster pizza and fillet minon steak. My wife had the scallops. She love them too."}
{"text":"Came here again for a Saturday lunch with husband and the baby.  The staff did a great job getting us a table away from the hustle and bustle where baby could eat his Cheerios in peace, and I didn't have to worry about the waitstaff spilling anything on him.  

The food, again, did not disappoint.  We started with the tomato, rosemary, and parmesan flatbread which was light, crispy and tasty.  Husband and I both ordered the Vinho Verde from the chef's picks.  The wine was light, crispy and just a tad sparkling.  It was the perfect complement to a warm, sunny, Saturday afternoon.

I ordered the blackened fish tacos and husband ordered the chicken shwarma kebobs.  The fish tacos were fresh and spicy.  I really liked them, but felt they kind of went overboard on the lettuce (which I just picked out, and then enjoyed them just fine). My husband really enjoyed the kebobs, which came with a spicy mango chutney and side salad.  The mango chutney was a nice compliment to the chicken.  The side salad came with pumpkin seeds which added a nice texture to the salad.

We ordered the chocolate and peanut butter mini indulgence which was tasty and just the right size.  We left feeling satisfied, but not overstuffed - I LOVE that!  This place will definitely be added to my regular rotation of restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm usually skeptical when a restaurant claims to have very healthy food that's under a certain amount of calories because the food is either, A. Served in kiddies sized portions so you end up snacking later on in the evening anyway, or B. Dull and flavorless.

And I'm happy to report that Season's 52 was surprisingly good! Very well sized, flavorful portions! 

Here are some highlights of my experience at Season's 52:

- VERY reasonably-priced
- fresh, seasonal ingredients
- crisp and well-seasoned veggies (the asparagus was omg good)
- excellent menu variety (highlights were the trout and the sea scallops - both were HUUUUGE - they didn't skimp on the scallops at all)
- healthy
- yummy appetizers (get the stuffed mushrooms)
- too tasty to be under 425 calories!!
- wonderful, attentive service
- great wine selection
- scrumptious mini-desserts

The best part is that you can reserve your table online at opentable.com, to avoid the wait. We had ZERO problem with our reservation as we were promptly seated upon arrival on a Saturday night. Yes, it is a chain, and yes, the interior resembles a dressed-up Olive Garden. However, despite those two qualities, Seasons 52 decently delivers as a middle-of-the-road, quality restaurant that will fit quite nicely into my go-to dining out rotation.

As far as healthy eating in the Biltmore area goes, this place is 10 times better than it's overly trendy (and overly awful) healthy food restaurant neighbor True Food Kitchen.  At Season's 52 you get excellent service, and a MUCH tastier menu with a variety of choices that put True Food Kitchen's menu to shame. Plus, you won't walk out spending as much!"}
{"text":"Wait, a restaurant with a seasonally changing menu and your entire plate comes in under 475 calories and it's not some weird little hippy place in a strip mall? Yep, that Seasons 52.

I'd heard great things about this place and so when I was in Phoenix for a few days and had the chance for date night with my wife, I jumped at the opportunity to check it out.

We got there about 6:00 on Friday night and the hostess told us that it would be a 45-minute wait for a table, but that if we wanted to eat in the piano bar, we could grab a booth or barstool right away and still order from the full menu. Well say piano bar, and you don't have to ask me twice! We took a booth and settled in to enjoy the sounds of the piano player and check out the menu.

Our server was extremely helpful and told us about the concept and that they would be switching to the Spring Menu in another week or so.

We started with an appetizer of Chipotle Shrimp which had four large grilled shrimp in a very tasty sauce.

I ordered the Salmon which was grilled on a wood plank and came with asparagus and carrots. My wife had the grilled Mahi-Mahi with vegetables. Both meals were incredible!

The final part of the meal is dessert. Wait, dessert at a place that's supposed to be healthy? Yes, it's true! The desserts are not large, in fact the entire serving comes in a shot glass. My wife had the key lime pie and I tried the Rocky Road. The taste was amazing, and the small size just made you savor it more and gave you enough of the flavor to satisfy any craving you might have without feeling overstuffed.

Now as to the restaurant itself, the place is beautiful! First of all, its at Biltmore Fashion Park so that tells you right away that this is a place you want to be. There is a large dining room and a back room. Everything is done in nice light wood and it has a modern, yet traditional feel. The bar area sort of reminded me of the way the old Houston's used to be set up across the street at the Esplanade and I love the fact that they had a live piano player.

Overall I can't say enough good things about Seasons 52. If I was in Phoenix full-time I would make this a regular hangout!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for a date night.

The Pork Tenderloin was some of the best I've ever had.  The scallops and flatbread were tasty, too.

Service was very good.  I felt our server was a bit pushy with her upselling, though.  The food came out incredibly quickly, so I would recommend ordering a little bit, seeing if the portions fill you up, and then ordering more depending on how you feel.

They had live music in the bar the night we were there, but it was a bit odd being in the main dining room because you couldn't really hear it.  They didn't have other music on, so it just sounded like quiet, not very impressive singing.  

Overall, I would recommend giving Seasons 52 a try for a Date Night.  Very tasty, and not too expensive.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Everything here was delectable,Healthy eating, seasonal items, and melded so well together.  Wonderfully Paired with a glass of dry or sweet wine. 
Indulge yourself in the mini desserts,  SO WORTH IT!!! Stick to one at a time to savor every lick from your dessert spoon and not to cross flavors that aren't paired well together. 
Nice & clean interior.  
Relaxed ambiance. 
Live female singer with easy on the ears voice. Good service.
Had to wait to be seated even with a reservation, although the kind hostess did make us aware as to the reason for this.  Communication is key.
Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Food was good but not great. The tomatoes on the crab cake sandwich were both off to one side. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"A very favorite restaurant.  Great atmosphere and the food is fantastic: Something for everyone, but not overextended.  I think I finally understand why the fuss over shrimp and grits.  OMG good.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal! The Seasonal Gyro Flatbread was huge and tasty! I never would have believed 450 calories could be so yummy and filling. Crispy tuna salad included a heaping of perfectly seared tuna, grilled pineapple chunks, fresh local greens, and nuts and veggies masquerading as salad crispies. The tiny dessert was just decadent enough to help me feel like the cat that ate the lo-cal canary. 
     However, the pacing of the meal and the professionalism of the staff left much to be desired. We arrived @ 7:25 for our 7:30 reservation. 'We don't typically seat when one arrives this early.' Early...are you kidding? 'Our reservations are running about 20 minutes behind because of overbooking by online services.' Like the OpenTable that we used to make our reservation.' We don't like those.' So now we're getting yelled at for forcing Seasons 52 to accept reservations from OpenTable. As a frequent diner, I didn't realize so much responsibility was involved. We were seated just before 8. We received our entrees after 9pm which felt late to my belly for a 7:30 reservation. We were thanked over and over again for our patience. Evidently our decision to remain seated was mistaken as feeling patient. As a dining party we felt hungry, disrespected, and taken for granted."}
{"text":"I came for the vegetarian menu. I'm impressed and might bring someone here for a fancy drink.  It doesn't seem casual enough for some more I like to hang out on a regular basis though."}
{"text":"Food was great as usual but the lady that greeted us at the door who I believe is the manager was very rude and condescending . I don't know what her problem is !!!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! It's the second time me and my wife came here and both times we really enjoyed everything Food and the Service. This time was special we had an amazing server His name is Tommy! Awesome guy with great energy. The best service we had in a long time. Also we had chance  to meet the manager David, great guy who made sure we were happy with everything."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, except for the hour and a half wait (but I guess what else should I expect on a Saturday night?).  The food was very forgettable.  It wasn't terrible and if you are looking for the right atmosphere (such as a power lunch), this is a great place.  As for the food, lower your expectations."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic.  We were a little early for our res, so we went to grab a drink at the bar.  The bartender was great, both before and after dinner (we just had to stop back).  The menu was delicious and the mini desserts were amazing.  Make sure to try their homemade strawberry vodka and prosecco!  Delish!!"}
{"text":"Had out of town guests and was planing a pizza; however, at the last minute, thought of Seasons 52 and glad we did!

It was 6ish; however, we were seated quickly and greeted by Alexandra, our server, promptly! She was wonderful!  great smile and helpful attitude throughout the dining event!

Our guests were rookies, so Alexandra explained the Seasons 52 program and carefully assisted a wine choice.

Dinner was amazing, served fast and it was hard top believe that each entree was only 475 calories... Great presentation, flavorful and \"healthy\"!

Drinks, appetizer, dinner and dessert were perfect!

THX!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love! 
All you need to do is order dessert here. It comes in small shot glasses & the flavors explode in your mouth.."}
{"text":"Great food,  incredible staff (today we had Seth), impeccable desserts. Love Seasons 52!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful & delicious dinner last night at Seasons 52. The service and food was great. The whole family enjoyed the menu & the calorie count. Sea bass ,Salmon ,Trout , & Swordfish, were our entrees. All cooked perfect. The soups were delicious & lobster flatbread a hit!  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great choice for Thanksgiving dinner! Food was great, including mini pumpkin pie and our server Mike was awsome! Even had leftovers to take home.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We dined again at Seasons52 and had another wonderful experience. We went for their Scallop night special which lasted 4 days for $19.99 they usually are priced at $25.99.Again the food was excellent the jumbo scallops were succulent served over a bed of lemon risotto with carrots and English peas accompanied with asparagus. We also shared a spinach salad with fresh strawberries and crumbled blue cheese in a balsamic vinaigrette while my daughter enjoyed the truffle mac and cheese yum!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with this location. Claims to close at 10pm on Tuesdays but we were turned away at 9:45 pm. Not very professional to turn away a $75 check."}
{"text":"Great location, good service, good food.
We came for dinner on a Thursday evening and did not have to wait for a table. Sea Bass was very good and cocktails were excellent. Waiter forgot to bring the wine I ordered, but later in the evening gave me a free glass to express his apology. Overall, we had a lovely dinner and would eat here again."}
{"text":"We had the Tuna steak and garden salad, nice and testy, good service. Very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service and food was just as good. Everything was above and beyond. Absolutely would be a place of recommendation. I personally can't wait to go back. From crab flat bread to mussels to sea bas and lamb chops...got to love this place. Not mention dessert on the end..."}
{"text":"My Family came in from out of town ,I wanted to take them here as I love it, I was so disappointed in the service we had and the way we were ignored and treated the server was rude and made several demeaning comments.We went at 3 pm there was maybe 6 other patrons , I called to speak to a manager and she pretty much dismissed me. Though the food was excellent I can't say I will be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"We come here pretty often for dinner - usually on Friday nights. It one of our go-tos for dinner, but I've never been for lunch. They display the caloric information on everything, which can sometimes be scary at restaurants but most things here are decently healthy, especially compared to other restaurants like it.  

If you plan on eating here on a Fri or Sat night, I definitely recommend reservations during the dinner rush hours (6-830ish)... We've noticed that if you don't have them, you'll be waiting about 15-30 minutes, even during the non-busy season; upwards of 30 when it's busy season.

The service is always friendly; we've never had terrible service, but some is definitely better than others. I prefer to sit in the main dining room, rather than the bar area because it's a lot noisier over there, however this isn't a quiet restaurant in any area. 

We've had most of the menu items  (I would say all of them on the Spring menu). I particularly enjoy the Short Rib; the only thing I have had and didn't like was because it was over cooked, but that was just a one time thing.

The wine selection isn't bad at all... I've always enjoyed the wines we've chosen. One of our favorites is the Fisher Unity Pinot Noir - definitely recommend this if you like Pinots... It was actually recommended to us by a server one night and now we almost always get a bottle. Their specialty drinks are unique and I have also liked all of the ones I have tried. I don't usually drink beers with my meal so I can't really comment on their beer selection personally but I often dine with beer drinkers and they never seen disappointed. 

Overall, we definitely enjoy Seasons 52 and come here pretty regularly... Probably about twice a month or so."}
{"text":"Great ambience, great service, flavorful, healthy food with calorie counts-but doesn't taste like a diet and best surprise of all-Very reasonably priced!! 2 cocktails, 3 apps, 2 entrees, 1 delectable dessert-$118!! Wish we had one in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Came here for a corporate presentation, and was very impressed by the severs, appetizers, the main courses and deserts. Every one at the table was commenting on how good the dinner was. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner with my wife Saturday night.  I called to get a reservation in 45-60 minutes and was told they only take reservations for 2 hours out or more?
We arrived shortly before 5, valet parked and found a short line at the host stand.  I had noticed a gentleman setting tables on the patio and asked to be seated there.   Got seated immediately. 
Our server showed up in a reasonable time and took our drink orders.  When she brought the drinks we went ahead and ordered.  Cevechi appetizer, split the lump crab wedge,  then cedar plank slalom for me and the filet for her.  The food was all 5 star. 
When the entrees arrived,  we asked for a coffee refill for my wife. About half way thru our meals,  still no coffee.   I walked inside and asked the hostess if someone could get us a coffee refill.  Finished eating,  still no refill.  The table next to us was being seated and I told the hostess seating them that I'd like to see the manager.  
The manager came by, listened to the problem and apologized saying they were brewing  a new pot and we should have been told.   I guess they have a really slow coffee pot. The manager offered dessert or a round if drinks for us.  We ordered dessert to go.   When i got the bill I noticed that the manager had taken very good care of us. 

Bottom line:
Food *****
Atmosphere *****
Service **
Management *****

I'm guessing the bad service was a fluke and I'll definitely  go back"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  

Came into Phoenix for a training/conference that lasted a week.  On the last night we were there, the group of around 30 people decided to head over to Seasons 52 as a farewell dinner.  Staff was incredible in accommodating a large party, and they were able to do it extremely smoothly with no fuss.  We also mostly arrived during happy hour, so there were opportunities with the menu that we took.

Food was excellent.  Our group had quite a hodge podge of different appetizers, entrees, drinks, and desserts, but some of the memorable ones included:
- scallops with bacon: absolutely wonderful.  The scallops were a good size, with bits of bacon crumbled on the top of it.  
- flatbread: tasty with a good thin crust.  I believe we had around 3 versions of the flatbread, all which had fresh ingredients and the crust was thin, yet both chewy and crispy in certain areas of it.  
- salads: all beautifully prepared and sectioned off on the plate so that the ingredients are not touching each other until it gets to you.  I did not get a good taste of any of the salads, but it was definitely fresh!
- sauteed mushrooms: juicy and full of flavor
- desserts: love them!  I love how each of their desserts were at a very reasonable price, and that they were basically in little cocktail glasses that you eat out of.  Pecan pie in a shotglass?  Why not?  Not too sweet, and it had all of the essences to make it a great, simple dessert.  I really wanted to try the strawberry shortcake, but that was quickly taken by another one on the table.  The tiramisu was very tempting, as well!

Wine and cocktails were ingested that night.  No issues on any of those fronts.  Happy hour cocktails are always awesome, too!  :)

Prices are high.  I can see the quality of the food and service being the reasons for it.  For a special date, it is money that I would spend.  For a quick dinner, probably not.  I feel that this is a place you would have to splurge at.

Parking is okay.  I actually walked from the hotel, so I didn't have much issue, though I notice the shopping center yellow tapes certain parts of the parking.

After having the food here, I hope the Costa Mesa location is as good if not better!"}
{"text":"Valentine's dinner part 1: started with Lobster flatbread with fresh mots and basil. Very tasty. I had the Chilean Sea Bass on black rice with shiitake mushrooms. Excellent - melts in your mouth. Melissa tried the Paella but the    Saffron added a Briny taste that neither of us liked. Our waitress took it back and got Melissa their scallops plate instead. They were great, although  I only got one because she would not share. And they came out in 5-7 minutes, very fast. Then we had the coffee and vanilla moose, and also the triple chocolate moose. They were in shot glasses, and on the house - which was unexpected, and I'll take free stuff all day. Service was very good, friendly and well informed. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite place to dine out! The martinis are to die for!  Strawberry basil martini!! Unbelievable! They have a great menu made up of different types of fish, chicken and Kobe beef! Their grilled artichokes are incredible, flat breads are to die for.  The potato and leek soup is too good. Took friends there from out of town and they thought the food was beyond fabulous! We had the best waitress, China!! I love her! She's such a hard worker and presents the menu and everyone's favorites, beautifully! I love the Chilean Sea Bass! I don't like fish, but this is unbelievable! The flavors are over the top! My guest had the Kobe beef and my other friend add the lobster lobster which I had a bite of, and wow oh wow! The deserts are small but perfect and very tasty! It's so you don't go home dying from all the food you ate.  I'm a foodie and no great food and my martinis! You can't go wrong with this place.  

What I truly love is you can be dressed down or dressed up and that's what I love about them as well. They take you as you are.  It's a beautiful restaurant and you can either dine inside or eat out side. 

You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had a gift card for Dardens. Don't care for Red Lobster so tried something new and was very surprised. Food was very good as well as service and ambiance. Really enjoyed the mini-indulgence which are small portioned deserts that are only $2.50. I was going to skip desert because I was full but decided to try it and glad I did! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Awesome!!  Fresh, Healthy with fine dining ambience and service."}
{"text":"Update:  The management team responded to me and have informed me that the soup contains vegetable stock.  Because the rest of our dinner (Vegetarian Sampler [vegan] and Salmon salad) were great, I have updated my review to reflect this information.

Original:  We usually really enjoy this restaurant but this time I was disappointed.  My concern is that, as a vegan, last night I ordered the same Asparagus soup off of the Vegan/Vegetarian menu BUT found out that it is made of chicken broth.  I am always concerned when menus are incorrect or even slightly off because, not only is this very important for some of us due to belief systems and religions but we have someone in our family with a medical condition who will be made extremely ill he eats something he cannot digest or for which he has a severe allergy.  I have always trusted their menu and hope they will the adjustment to be accurate."}
{"text":"Excellent overall experience. The service is awesome. The value when considering the food quality, portion sizes, ambiance,  and service is tremendous. The wine list is huge and the glasses are generous. The menu is diverse and healthy, without being overwhelming or pretentious. Our wait staff was a little unorganized getting us seated, but took care of us in the end. Great selection of deserts, small and inexpensive the way they should be. Word of caution about reservations - they seem to run late. Highly recommended for just about any occasion be it causal, romantic, business, or even formal."}
{"text":"My review is more of a 3.5 rating for food and a four for excellent service and the complimentary truffles given to us. 

The service was great overall. Our server and the hostess that assisted were very good in terms of service. The food however, did not really impressed me especially for the price they charged. The proportion of the food was some where between the middle. It was not too much and it was not too small on portion. We ordered the flat breads first- it was good. Our server constantly checked on us and refilled our drinks which is a plus. I ordered the Plansville Farm Turkey Skewers. Although it looked good and beautifully decorative, it was a 3 at best. Again, for the prices that we are charged, I was expecting \"Wow\" not, \"Eh\". I can grab some turkey skewers at pita jungle and az kabob in Scottsdale that tastes better than the ones I had here.  However, it was a nice lunch. I don't think I would come back on my own."}
{"text":"Hostess was MIA, a tad flakey. Waiter, very friendly, exuberant. 
Returned for a lunch and was disappointed, as were my guests. The buffalo burger was bland and as an a al carte, not impressed. The grilled shrimp (to pricey)  had too much cajun spice and overwhelmed the noodles, spinach and mushroom dish. The apple coleslaw was too vinegary, I brought the left over home and added a small spoon of organic mayo and it balanced the flavors greatly. The only thing we enjoyed was the seasonal beer.  
Don't think we will return, the portions were meager and bland. I know how to cook healthy and more flavorfully at a fraction of their cost. Ambience - so-so."}
{"text":"Twice in one week. You can't say I didn't try! 

The weather has been so beautiful that eating indoors was not an option in my book. On a Tuesday, 3 girlfriends and I sat on the front patio for Happy Hour. We ordered everything on their HH menu and then some, as well as all the deserts. The food at Seasons 52 is AMAZING! Everything we tried, including all the wine flights was well worth the money. Unfortunately, the service was at the other end of the spectrum..HORRIBLE. 

At one point during our time there, my friend called the restaurant from her cell phone to try and get somebody outside to take care of us. Prior to that, one of us had gone inside to fetch our server on 2 different occasions and more times we just waited, and waited for him to come outside and check on us while needing something.

In addition, his communication skills were less than optimal when he was there. He offered no insight into the menu, suggestions or explainations when asked. His manner was not good and you could tell he couldn't have cared less if we were enjoying our time there. Not sure a couple of the things he did would be acceptable at any restaurant. 

A few days later, I decided to go back by myself for the wine, lobster flatbread and scallops! YUM! 

This review would be way to wordy and long if I went into ALL the issues we/I experienced with the service on both of these visits. Suffice to say, if HORRIBLE from the first visit had an evil twin, that's what it was on the second visit. 

In fairness, I had the same 'server' on both occasions. Therefore, I couldn't say for sure if Seasons 52 could earn a 4 or 5 star review if I'd had a different server, but certainly they should have an idea of what this server is doing. I mean, when, after asking 3 times, I finally went inside to get my own glass of water from the bartender; wouldn't she have thought that was odd? Or is that just normal for them?

Bottom line, not sure if I'd go back. Unfortunately the chef and staff are apparantly working their butts off back there to provide incredibly delicious dishes, only to have the staff spoil the experience. The patio is nice, the interior is beautiful, the food is excellent. I really, really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to have a well-connected friend invite me to a preview lunch at Seasons 52.  I was very impressed by the service, the quality of the food and the decor in the restaurant.  What really makes Seasons stand out though were the desserts.  Each dessert was so small, just a shot glass, but what a shot they were.  I had the Rocky Road and it was creamy, chocolately, and did not leave me clutching my stomach 10 minutes later from sugar overdose."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place to have a memorable dining experience. Seasons 52 has wonderful chefs who strive to make your dining experience a positive and memorable experience. Our kids were thrilled by their meal here.  Everything is delicious from the flatbread pizza to fish to the amazing short ribs. 

Leave room for dessert in shot glasses too.  The wait staff is just as fine as the food and the ambiance.
Try it, you'll like it..."}
{"text":"I loved the restaurant and the waiter we had was above and beyond good. The place is a little hard to find it didn't make any sense to me that the address was adjacent to the street it was actually on. I went with a friend so there was only two of us, but the shrimp appetizer was fantastic and my tuna crunch salad was absolutely perfect. My friend got the lamb chop dinner and he really enjoyed that. The food was fresh and wonderful. I love the indoor setting but we sat outside because it was so beautiful, next time I think I'll go enjoy a different area of the restaurant. I loved that it looked very fancy but many people were dressed very casual including the waiters. So I was very at ease and comfortable in my shorts and top.
Most of my friends would say I have a very high standard to meet with my food, I would agree.  I like good fresh food that I can taste flavors in and this place did it for me."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the most inept kitchen staff on planet earth. My wife and I visited seasons 52 on a Wednesday night and sat at the bar. I ordered a Rob Roy and it was acceptable except for the cherry garnish. It was not a luxardo which is ok but it was warm mushy and disgusting.
Next we ordered the meatball appetizer. The first set were cold. The replacement set were also Cold The third set were ice cold in the center. The fourth and final set of meatballs were not only cold but raw in the center. I mean raw, not rare. 
This tells me that after three tries no one cares enough to make it correctly. I blame the chef, not the minimum wage guy on the app station.
Just plain poor management. Bar tender tried but had no support."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today and was really surprised at the reasonable prices $8-12 and the exceptional HEALTHY food.  I had the fish tacos which were really tasty and a small dessert.  Everything on the menu is under 475 calories.  They had hamburgers, ravioli, tacos, etc.  A lot of variety really.  They also had cute tasty desserts for under 250 calories i think?  Bottom line reasonably priced food that is healthy, cant go wrong.  A very swanky atmosphere too, made me feel important and all grown up :) he he.  They get a lot of old women and lawyers by the looks of the place."}
{"text":"Had the Maui Tuna Salad yesterday, for $17.50 it was overpriced.  Seven bite-sized pieces of tuna with greens.  Couldn't find the pineapple on the salad  Kona Grill has a way more generous seared tuna salad.  My friend had the hamburger, a bit dry, but calorie saving on the lack of mayo, cheese, etc..  I have a business lunch this week there again.  I will order the fish tacos, which I have had before.  Ask for a booth in the bar area, it is quieter away from the open kitchen."}
{"text":"Thank you AMEX!  Was lucky enough to enjoy a complementary preview dinner here on AMEX.  I was thoroughly impressed by nearly every aspect of this place.

The atmosphere is dimly lit, and very comfortable...as Kirstin E. said, think Houstons.  As stated, the bar is huge and unique in that they have the entertainer sitting behind the bar, with the bartenders.  The guy singing the night I was there was very good, and was not too loud that you couldn't converse (pet peeve).

The whole staff seemed extremely attentive and courteous.  Seeing as dinner was free, our kind and attentive waitress Christi , encouraged us to try as much as we'd like, and we did.  They change their menu seasonally, and naturally they were on Autumn.  In addition to their seasonal menu changes, they have a side menu which changes every week, using the freshest ingredients available that week.  (Hence the name Seasons 52...)

Started with:
-Caramelized Crab & Shrimp Stuffed Mushrooms = Covered in toasted garlic and Parmesan cheese, amazingly tasty.
-Artichoke and Goat Cheese Flatbread = Was the flatbread special of the week, and was delicious.  The flatbreads are extremely thin and light, yet packed with flavor.  Perfect appetizer for the table to share, for those that don't like to get stuffed prior to their entrees.
-Chicken Tortilla Soup = Was the special soup of the week.  Delicious, southwest cumin flavor.  Not brothy, yet not thick.  I hate when tortilla soups are thick and cream based...this thankfully was not.

Salads:
-Two people at the table had salads (I did not), one Greek and one Arugula.  Both were from the \"Small Salads\" section of the menu...which coincidentally were not small at all.  Both said they tasted good though.

Entrees:
-Grilled Mahi-Mahi with ponzu glaze and rice & vegetables = Was the weekly fish special.  Perfectly grilled with a flavorful ponzu sauce, served over fresh snap peas and bok choy, along with steamed rice.
-Cedar plank Salmon = Served on its own individual cedar plank along with fresh steamed veggis.  The cedar plank made the salmon taste amazing as expected...full of that delicious cedar smokey flavor.
-Grilled Boneless Rainbow Trout = The tastiest entree at the table.  It was a huge piece of trout, grilled perfectly and simply seasoned.  They also grill a piece of lemon for you to squeeze over it, which adds a wonderful zesty flavor.

Desserts:
-Sampled a bunch of their \"mini indulgences,\" the Meyer Lemon Pound Cake and Key Lime Pie were the favorites...but all were wonderful.  Love the size of these things.  I've never been one to eat much dessert, simply because I'm too darn full after a good meal to indulge on dessert.  But these are perfectly sized...and a great way to end your meal.
-Even the coffee was very good too!

All in all...I can't wait to come back and try more of the things on the menu when they officially open, going to have to pay for that meal though unfortunately!  Which by the way, pricing is fair and reasonable given the outstanding quality or food.  As the others have said....everything on the menu has 475 calories or less!  Proof that you do not need food to be unhealthy for it to be tasty and satisfying!

Highly recommend you try Seaons 52 when they open on Monday!"}
{"text":"I applaud this restaurant for keeping the calorie count down, but I thought the food was kind of boring for the price. I was hoping for a more innovative approach to healthy cuisine - I had fillet which was well cooked, but the side of steamed vegetables were boring and made me feel like I was trying to diet.  Some of the other fillets on the table were overcooked. 

Also, I think it's lame that this restaurant boasts a sommelier at all - the wine list is weak. Don't even bring up that you have a sommelier working for the chain - it matters that you have knowledgeable staff at the actual restaurants who understand what's on the menu. Also, the few \"recommendations\" I've tried have been fruit bombs. 

I'd eat here again if someone really wanted to try it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here when there are so many other options out there."}
{"text":"I typically like to embellish my reviews, but the day is long and my stomach is empty so I will get right to it. 

By now you know that Seasons 52 changes their menu every season and has a new side menu each week, hence the 52 if that was not obvious enough. There are a hundred other amazing restaurants in this area but Seasons 52 truly stands above the crowd with the total experience factor which includes the great ambiance, service and food that is Vegas worthy.  

If you are looking for an upscale restaurant with moderate prices and food that you can pronounce but tastes like you can't, Seasons 52 is for you."}
{"text":"We had an unexpectedly great night, last night. The meal was excellent and our server, Fernando, was by far the best server any of us had ever had anywhere. He made the night exceptional!!!
The menu has a huge assortment of dishes and wines and everything we ate and drank was delicious!! And we especially loved the mini desserts. So decadent without overindulging, if you can stop after one!
Thanks Fernando.... you rock!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this 2 stars. Bad luck. The food is great; our server was nice. But the kitchen screwed up our order twice ; didn't  bring out one of our guests meals so we ended up canceling and picking up McDonald's for him. I had to ask 4 times to get a glass of water. 
Better luck next time."}
{"text":"I really, really, really want to give this restaurant five stars, however, at the end of the evening, I became sick...you know...contaminated food type sick.

I did love the experience in the restaurant, however.  (Not to be confused with the bar, which was lacking in attentiveness.)  Sean, however, made up for the poor experience we received in the bar when we got to the restaurant.  He was very attentive, very conscientious, and very friendly.

I really love the concept.  And my meal (scallops) was so delicious!  And the dessert...OMG...the dessert!  I had three!  YUMMY!

Even though I became sick, I will try it again.  There were enough good experiences to entice me to return once more and give it another try."}
{"text":"Great happy hour!

They have small plates for $5 and they definitely don't disappoint. I recommend the duck wings and chicken skewers -- both had Asian flavors, very satisfying. We tried the lamb plate as well, it was good but it was too small. 

The cucumber basil smash is my favorite drink! I tried the prairie mule and the organic sunshine martini but the cucumber basil smash was the best hands down."}
{"text":"We had a party group of 20 and we were all accommodated! Our waitress was amazing and the v food was even better! I absolutely love the atmosphere, fun, energetic, and laid back!  My husband and I will be going back! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. I really enjoyed the creativity and thought that went into the menu. They had some excellent Veg options and were willing to work with you to meet any dietary needs."}
{"text":"I love this place.  One of the best places in town.  Which is absolutely amazing due to the fact it is owned by the same company who owns Olive Garden.  Service has always been amazing.  Food is usually above average.  Ambience is nice. I have never had a bad meal.  Due to the meals only having 475 calories, it makes the experience so much better for those who like to eat, and not feel guilty."}
{"text":"I have been to Seasons 52 many times in LA Jolla CA. and  Costa Mesa CA.  Both B quality. However my experiences a the 52 Seasons in Phoenix AZ has been outstanding ! A quality in menu selection and service. I believe this is because of management. In fact we have never waited to be seated at our table at the Seasons 52 in Phoenix.  We always make reservations through Open Table.  Even with reservations it is not unusual to wait 30 minutes for a table in California.  Pisses me off as a good consumer. Anyway, go to Seasons 52 in Phoenix.  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Welcome all Dieters this is the place to eat. Healthy food all sliding under the 500 calories per entree. That's Impressive!! Tasty Too! 
The waiters are great and they seem to appreciate good fashion, excellent cocktails and the Piano Player, Anna is Superb!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the concept of getting to go out, eat good food, and it still be good for you! Typically it feels like healthy eating is an at-home activity only. Seasons 52 has an upscale atmosphere so it's good for work lunches. I had the Vegetarian Tasting Plate, which was quite good. The tofu was my favorite - great savory flavor and a good consistency. The prices are a little high so unfortunately I won't eat here as often as I would if entrees were in the $10 range. Service was prompt and I was in & out in an hour at lunch (another reason it's good for a work lunch)."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, which is the most important thing to me. The whole \"experience\" ended up being kind of gimmicky, I wish the staff didn't insist on explaining the \"low calorie\" thing. I already knew about it and it was a really long speech, especially w/ the appetizers, wines, etc. Plus the dessert thing was kind of silly. I feel like people who choose Seasons 52 already know about it and don't need a long explanation, or could do with a shorter spiel. Anyway, the flatbread margherita appetizer was great. The steak I ordered was just okay. My mom said the fish she ordered was great. It looked like there were a lot of business dinners going on, but we were there really early because I was with my (older) parents."}
{"text":"This beautiful restaurant just around the corner from us is a welcome addition to the Biltmore dining opportunities. It was PACKED the second night it was open and we were impressed at the decor and the LIVE piano bar with entertainment 7 nights/week. Our server,Megan, (happens to be my oldest daughter's name...) recommended a Flatbread appetizer that was just fantastic. \"Seasonally inspired cooking with every item under 475 calories...\" a quote from their menu. Because we are light evening meal people, instead of ordering the Fillet we ordered the twin tournedos and shared. Our \"wine by the glass\" was actually served by Megan from the bottle at table-side. It was a very pleasant \"first time\" dining experience and will become a regular for us. I have to give 4 stars for our first time there but I feel I will increase my rating after a few more visits."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this location. We went because a friend's daughter had been managing it the year before but she had been promoted (Congratulations Charlotte!). The food could well be farm to table with the best fresh produce and excellent meats. We shared a bottle of red wine and felt great about eating well on fresh, healthy dishes. Seasons 52 is a great place for business dinners and special occasion."}
{"text":"What a place! The staff are all so pleasant. Especially Nate, the bartender. And the food! ...Forget about it!!! It's foodie week, so I get to try things I wouldn't ordinarily try. The chicken flatbread was on point. Caprese salad was tasty. And the pork tenderloin was out of pocket!

The pianists (I've heard two different ladies sing here) voices are soothing to the ear. And my requests are always granted! :-D"}
{"text":"This is the only chain restaurant that gives me what I like to call an \"individual experience.\" Most chains treat you like a number while Seasons 52 treats you like this could be a special occasion every time you walk in. I love getting their white fish dish and if we're are there on time, I enjoy the wine flight and flat bread. Seriously the best deal around, ask your server and thank Preston for telling you ;)"}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is all low calorie which is a great start to the day.
I was here for lunch.
The staff was awesome and great. Their tomatos were really fresh and had flavor. 
The place is decorated in dark wood which I like, and the restrooms are cleaned and well mantained.
Parking is abundant, it is at the Biltmore.
The only thing is the prices are high so you can't dine here all the time, at least I can't. But, it is worth it once and awhile."}
{"text":"I ordered the NY strip and it was overcooked.  The Truffle Mac and Cheese was dry.  I doubt I would go back."}
{"text":"This is a great alternative to the typical butter bomb upscale restaurants around here; because they don't use ANY butter! Every dish they serve is under 475 calories.
The food is fresh and tasty. Their salmon salad is delicious. So is their Ahi Tuna salad, and I love the seasonal organic greens and that they only use wild fish.
 
The mini indulgence desserts are so so so yummy! They are perfect because they are just big enough to fill that sweet tooth but not make you feel sick or guilty. My FAVORITE is the Pecan Pie with the White Chocolate Mouse. 

I LOVE that they have a live pianist/singer every night at the bar. The bartenders are very friendly and the atmosphere is classy but not stuffy. They have a good and reasonably priced wine selection.
I would recommend this place to people who like a classy atmosphere and tasty healthy good quality food."}
{"text":"After it's first couple weeks under their belts I came to try them out. And yes I'm one of those that prefer to sit at the bar and to observe how the operation runs, and I was very impressed. I will be putting this on my regular rotational stops for Dinner and/or Drinks. **** four stars. I'm adding one more for the friendly staff and the 'better that most' wine list. Not extensive (yet) but a good cross-section of world wines (except for New York State wineries, where there are over 300 now and do a huge leap above the rest in white wines in the country). I sampled four varietals and the Tempranillo Rioja was first class. At first the bartender hadn't seen us sit down, but after a few minutes he was friendly & attentive, who suggested an app of flat bread Pineapple & Chipotle Shrimp. Yes Delicious. Reasonable prices... a great 'date' destination. Loved how they had the piano bar, unique"}
{"text":"WARNING - You are going to leave hungry. I have never been filled  from a  475 calorie meal in my life and you won't either. They do have a great business plan, which is, serve half the food at twice the price and sell it as healthy. I would not go again, and i would not recommend the restaurant to friends."}
{"text":"Perfect for a special date night. I have been here a few times. The food and service is spectacular. I love the seasonal menu. The cocktail list is also great. Will be returning here in the future."}
{"text":"While I admit that we didn't eat a ton of food, what we did order was terrific. We had a flatbread pizza with goat cheese and artichoke hearts and a bowl of fresh mushroom soup that was excellent. The restaurant is very attractive and one can sit in a comfortable booth that offers privacy with a noise level that makes talking easy (compared to so many places today). My friend and I ordered wine and the portions were full and the wine selection, including newer organic selections, perfect. The service was not hurried, accommodating, and very pleasant. The dessert tray looks fantastic but we didn't bite this time . I will return again soon with my husband!!"}
{"text":"Goat cheese stuffed ravioli with less than 475 calories??? Yes please!  Seasons 52 is a refreshing change from the typical Giant corporation restaurant.  It still stands out as having a big chain vibe with the large busy restaurant, standard booths and tables , giant portions and fancy host seating machines.  I'm not against big chains, but for the most part I avoid them because they are relatively uninventive and rarely have new menu options.   This is not the case at Seasons 52. The menu changes with the season and the food is portioned appropriately, allowing you to enjoy multiple courses without a guilty conscience. 

Our meal started off with tomato flat bread. It was simply an extremely thin crust pizza in the shape of a rectangle. It was okay, but lacked salt.  Next I ordered the soup of the day which was a creamed corn without any cream.  It was incredibly tasty, and I was impressed that they managed to obtain a creamy texture and consistency without cream or milk! For the main course I ordered the goat cheese ravioli served with veggies and a tomato stock.  It was excellent.  It is served as two fist sized raviolis stuffed with herbed goat cheese.  It seemed like a lot of cheese, but when combining it with the vegetables and broth, it was divine! For dessert we tried 3 different mini indulgences: Key Lime pie, Pecan pie, and peanut butter mouse.  Between the two of us we could not agree on a favorite, but they were all fantastic!"}
{"text":"Seasons 52 is my absolute favorite restaurant in town.  I know it's not local but where else can you enjoy your dinner and not stress about the calories.  The first time I visited Seasons my boyfriend asked that they hold the butter on the salmon.  The server giggled and proudly informed us that the kitchen did not have butter.  The salmon and filet are divine.  They currently have a great special where you get a flatbread and flight of wine for $15.  You have to get there early though because the special ends at six.  I love the desserts, just large enough to feel satisfied.  You can take them to go if you pay an extra dollar for the glass."}
{"text":"i don't get it.

our service was no bueno. our waiter rarely came around and kept forgetting things. also, they tried dusting our booth in the middle of our meal. i thought that was extremely tacky, it wasn't even close to closing or anything. they just felt like dusting over our dinner? 

they claim to be super healthy and fresh, but start to ask questions about the ingredients and freshness and you'll find out everything is rubbed in sugar and everything is frozen or pre-made. 

i went with the pork with haricot verts. i ordered it medium but it was well done and very dry. he sat my plate down and immediately said 'they over cooked it, would you like me to take it back?' 

1. why would he bring it out if it was wrong?
2. obviously, he didn't want to fix it or he wouldn't have even brought it to me....so i didn't send it back and i just added some salt to help it out. and i didn't want to wait another 30 minutes.

so the price, combined with the food, and the bad service- i won't be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Was my daughters birthday and our waitress gave her a rose and a handwritten card!  Food was fantastic!  Go here!!!"}
{"text":"Food was of great quality. I was expecting smaller portions because of the fancy ambiance and dimmed lights, but nope, dishes are generous and abundant. Everything was delicious! Out waiter was Fausto, he was very adequate, resourceful, and respectful. Would love to go back."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my office and it was very disappointing! Succinctly put: I would not want to spend my own money here, as I found very little value in what I ordered, which was recommended by the server (mea culpa), and found little appeal to make me want to come back.
We were seated right behind the hostess desk, and had the sun from the entrance glaring in our faces the whole time. For a restaurant that is designed to be sophisticated, intimate, and offer privacy for each booth/table, we felt like we might as well have been seated next to the bathroom. It felt makeshift; and the place was not very busy. 
But this obviously won't reflect what most people experience here, since there seemed to be one crappy table and that's what we got. Bummer for our group, which was celebrating a birthday. (n.b: the restaurant did nothing as far as birthdays go, other than sit us as the welcome table)
Right off the bat, the lunch menu did not knock my socks off. It seemed rather standard - nothing creative, nothing that stood out.  But that's just me. There wasn't anything that made me think \"wow, I could never make that at home, gotta try it.\"  I am not a pro chef, but this all seemed like normal food you can prepare at home any day for 1/4 of the price - flatbreads (yawn! come on, flatbreads? weak excuse for pizza, weaker excuse for a higher end restaurant. no thank you!), salads, and typical protein entrees featuring chicken, fish, and beef. The gimmick here is that the menu is \"seasonal\", thus implying that everything should be the freshest possible. Well I am calling BS on that. They offer, for instance, a caprese sandwich. Hmm, interesting since tomatoes are not in season for another 4-5 months. It's a gimmick, and a lousy one at that. Nothing about the menu felt exclusively seasonal. I guess \"seasonal\" is now a very fluid term and used for marketing purposes only. 
This kind of subtle dishonesty is a major turn off for me. Too many expensive restaurants out there bullsh*tt*ing their guests with fancy PR, but serving the same crap as chain restaurants.  
Our server made a rather glaring mistake that nobody owned up to. Otherwise he was fine, but this error is really bad. As we sat at our table, the server brought out one salad. One solitary salad (entree size), and placed it on the table. And then..nothing else came out. It was awkward. We sat there, 7 of us, with one salad on the table. For over 10 mins.  WTF. Even worse? it wasn't our order... what that person ordered was soup, not salad. So not only they got the order wrong (ok that can happen sometimes), they pretty much let us know that this staff has zero knowledge of proper dining and serving etiquette. You do NOT start serving until at least everyone at the table is getting an item, be it their app or entree. This is not acceptable. Basic decency dictates, if you are dining with others, you do NOT start your meal until EVERYONE has been served. That is basic human decency. But what happens if your server staggers the items by more than 10 mins? You can sit there and wait till it gets cold or stale, out of respect for others, or be that boor who starts eating and everyone else can just watch. Or at least ask if items can be brought out early. This is the most basic rules of hospitality and service. For a $30 per person restaurant, that is unacceptable. I didn't settle the bill, but if I had, the tip would have certainly reflected this incompetence. If I was the manager there... I would be embarrassed by this kind of service. This may seem like a minor thing to people... \"oh well not every dish can timed to be ready together etc...\" Well you know what? yes they can. The chefs know exactly how long it takes to make something and know exactly in what order to make it all so that everything is served timely. May not be the easiest process during a busy lunch, but guess what, that's what we pay for!  D'oh!  #GetItTogether  Once we got the server's attention, he took the salad back and basically shrugged it all off. I don't think he even realized that he did worse than just bring the wrong item.... and that's what really turned me off. Well moving on... the service afterwards was impeccable, with several people bringing out all our items at once. That is the expectation, while not necessarily seeming like the norm there....
And now the food....I ordered 1 item, the crispy braised short rib sandwich. And to be blunt, it sucked bad. Like \"seasonal\", \"sandwich\" is also apparently a fluid term now. What I got was a quesadilla, not a sandwich. It was a fkn baked tortilla, folded over. Inside was pickled red onion, and loads of horseradish crema. Oh, and a tiny bit of cheddar cheese, barely noticeable, and even less rib meat. I even had to open the sandwich (which broke the toasted tortilla into several pieces) to check if there was even any meat in it.  I'd wager that there was less than $1 worth of rib in it. Pathetic, and they want $12 for that! No thanks."}
{"text":"mmm hmmm. Been four more times. Four. That was because we liked it so much the first time. I hesitated giving it three stars since the last three visits have been less than stellar.

For our most recent visit, I forgive them the kitchen staff coming out and serving during restaurant week. Well, kind of.  But it was the lovely's birthday. Service was ridic - our server asked twice - once taking the order then coming back out of the kitchen and asking again -  how he wanted his steak cooked, presumably because the kitchen doesn't like cooking it med/well. Which I get but too bad - he's the customer, and thats what he wants. Sheesh and then by all means give him the stink eye because we love that! 

My usually perfect Maui Crunch salad arrived drenched in dressing. Couldn't finish it. Server brought over the mini desserts and went into her schpiel without asking if we actually wanted dessert. When we informed her that we didn't, you'd have thought we just abducted her cat. Seriously? And the cherry on topa that little sundae?? Four times at least while we're drinking coffee she asks if we want anything else. By try number four, she doesn't have to ask us to leave, we want to.

Unfortunately, we've had similarly poor service mostly. The food, wine, atmostphere and overall experience are, as a general rule really good. But as we went for a birthday and an anniversary, we wanted a consistently good experience all around and we just haven't gotten it. We'd be going this weekend but we're just not interested in being disappointed."}
{"text":"Wonderful bartenders, great food, good atmosphere. And u can't beat food that has flavor AND is calorie conscience!! Mom and I love it here! Also, $5.00 happy hour plates Monday thru F"}
{"text":"Ordered lobster tail and risotto.  The risotto came ice cold and server didn't offer to shell the lobster tail for me.  Quality of the food was not what I expected"}
{"text":"So seasons is one of my favorite spots. I come here anytime I want a nice dinner I like it better than Flemings and other nice places but last time I was here, my server wasn't the best and just about everything I was interested in eating was sold out. Even the desert I always get. For spending 100$ I kinda would have like to get excellent service not just mediocre and be able to order what's advertised. There was one of my second choices left so I had to order it and eat it way before my fiancées meal came out... kinda ruined the point of eating together? Seems like they could have just told the kitchen to hold the last one until the table knew what they wanted. I order quickly because of the lack of food they had and couldn't decide on something else quickly cause top 3 of our picks were sold out. Even some of the flatbreads were sold out. It wasn't any big weekend or holiday it was just 8pm? So to wrap it up I was definitely disappointed with this visit."}
{"text":"After my initial review, I was contacted by the Director of Operations regarding my experience.  I am super impressed with their customer service, Kudos for working to make this right.  I was given a gift card and asked to give them another chancem which I did.  The service was much improved, a gluten free menu was brought immediately when requested, I was allowed to order all the items on the menu, not just a couple selections,  the server (and everyone who helped tend to us) - all very friendly and upbeat.  The food was tasty and overall this was a much better experience."}
{"text":"A great happy hour with lots of choices.  The wine selection for happy hour was just \"OK\".  The service was great, food delicious, atmosphere superb.  I will definitely return soon,  I ordered grilled glazed scallops and shrimp&grits.  No left overs for me; good food and right portions."}
{"text":"Oh what a night! Took my date here back on June 13. It was a very special time for me, as I remember what a night.

The lady and I came in on a Wednesday evening and were promptly greeted by the hostess. She asked if we'd like to be seated at a table or in their piano bar; it was open seating. Delighted to hear that we could enjoy our dinner with a little live piano, I opted to check out the bar. 

Oh I, got a funny feeling when we walked in the room. And I, as I recall it ended much too soon. Miffed at having to wait 15 minutes now with no waiter stopping by, we went back to the hostess and asked if we could sit somewhere that had actual wait staff to take our orders. After a quick and sincere apology from the hostess and who I believe to have been the manager, they said they would seat us with their best waitress! They too seemed; or at least acted, genuinely concerned that we had to wait so long. 

Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me. She was everything I dreamed she'd be. Within moments of being seated; for real this time, our waitress had our drink orders and was describing the specials of the day.  We ordered up a bowl of (so-so) chicken tortilla soup.Then went on to a (super fantastic) artichoke / goat cheese flat bread!

The Summer Vegetarian Tasting Salad was out-a-sight, it came with one an awesome tasting taco and it was all veggie! The wife loved the chili relleno, and I found the cedar roasted tofu with mango chutney to be top notch. The \"grains of life\" as they are listed on the menu was one of the better versions of quinoa I've been served in the valley; light refreshing and one of the best protein sources you can find in the veggie kingdom.

Along with our vegetarian sampler, we shared an order of Wood-Roasted Pork Tenderloin; and oh was it tender. Served up with an amazing creamy herb polenta and one or two other vegetables, this meal was 100% delish.

Oh what a night, this meal was turning out to be. Sweet Surrender, what a night! They served me up a few of those Mini Indulgence Desserts. \"Yes, I'll have two desserts.\" Why not, they're only a couple bucks!

Thanks seasons 52 for turning around an unimpressive start and taking care of what could have been an ugly experience, you guys certainly saved the evening!

I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder, Straining my head around and taking my body under. O what a night! After a meal like this I'll be singing that famous Four Seasons song for a days to come. OH what a night! Doo dit doo dit dit, doo dit doo dit dit. Oh what a night!..."}
{"text":"We celebrated our 25th Anniversary at the Phoenix location and absolutely loved everything.  The food was phenomenal, especially the tuna tartare.  The Sea bass and scallops were prepared with healthy perfection.  And most of all Karen, our server, was spectacular.  Congrats to the whole team at Seasons 52.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to Seasons before and usually have average great service. Usually I wouldn't write a review even if the service was great, however, today stood out. Our waiter, Tommy, was exuberant! He really brightened the place up and gave 110% with service. I've never had a waiter so passionate with their job. The food as always is amazing but the service made the meal. If you're in town and want amazing service request Tommy. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews I saw. I have always had exceptional service here. I like that you can be fairly casual or dressed up and still be very comfortable here. I also like the decor and smell of rich wood as you enter. I appreciate that the menu is healthy but you don't feel like you're missing out on anything. They offer some fantastic wine selections as well. Sorry to see some others didn't enjoy it. Hopefully they'll try it out again with a better experience."}
{"text":"This is such a beautiful restaurant.  My partner and I enjoyed our second meal here tonight, and we were not disappointed.  The restaurant is simply beautiful, with live music, elegant surroundings and complimentary valet parking.  The food was extraordinary.  We started with the edamame, which were fresh and flavorful and perfectly cooked.  I had the field green salad and a bowl of fantastic porcini mushroom bisque.  My partner had the mushroom and goat cheese ravioli with lobster flatbread as her entree.  I would highly recommend a reservation (we got 1000 point through OpenTable the first time), as the Biltmore Center tends to get really packed in the evening.  Per the manager Ryan, the restaurant changes their menu with the seasons and sources as much of the food locally as they possibly can.  Definitely a place you will want to come for a special occasion (make one up if you have to)."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Seasons 52 without the guilt of other restaurants!  I started with the goat cheese ravioli and they were delicious.  Next I moved on to the pork tenderloin with mushrooms and broccoli over polenta...flavorful and filling.  I ended with the raspberry white chocolate cannoli mini dessert...just enough to fulfill my sweet tooth.  It seems you can't go wrong at this place and that is why I will keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I went here today for the first time for lunch with a co-worker. Parking was a breeze and we were seated immediately. The restaurant is a bit dark but it's quite lovely and very classic. 

We started with the blistered peppers appetizer. The goat cheese/ feta on the was amazing. It simply melted in your mouth. We both had the crispy short rib sandwich. It was simple yet delicious. You get your choice of a side which is served in a cute little lidded jar. I had the pickles on the side and left wanting more. He had the potato salad. The star of the lunch was dessert. He had the key lime and I had the s'mores. They are served in what appears to be a shot glass so it is the perfect size to leave a sweet taste in your mouth without leaving you stuffed.

The service was excellent and Denver once did we fell rushed. I walked out feeling that this wonderful lunch made up for all the quick serve meals I have endured lately."}
{"text":"We can begin with the great service which always adds to the dining experience, and Seasons 52's servers are top notch - friendly , knowledgeable and attentive. But of course, the food is the centerpiece and it never disappoints me here. I go once a month with a professional group and then with family sometimes too, and there's always great new menu items. Being a fish lover, a good selection and preparation of fish is very important to me and they always come through with something fresh, delicious and accompanied by great vegetables. THe mini-deserts are just right in terms of size, and sweetness - just enough to polish off the meal without bogging you down (or feeling guilty)."}
{"text":"Servers need to NOT show up at table  every ten minutes and when they do show up--NOT interrupt diners' conversation."}
{"text":"Tried the arugula flatbread and the margherita (?) flatbread.  Both were delicious, very thin and crusty base.  The salad was spinach, raspberries, bleu cheese and pine nuts which was also very good.  The fillet was very tender but the sauce smelled very similar to chinese herbal medicine that I didn't like.  The taste however was pretty decent.  The asparagus that came with the fillet was not cleaned very well at all and had lots of grit.  Also had several spears that were overdone and stringy.  

All in all, I am intrigued by this place and would like to return for more samples of the menu.  However, slightly thrown off by the gritty asparagus.."}

{"text":"AZ restaurant week with friends. Placed was packed and with good reason. We started off with a flat bread. Fresh food on top with different toppings. I could have easily made a meal with that alone but just starting.   Then came the salad parts. I ordered the spinach with balsamic vinegar aged to perfection. It also had cheese and fresh strawberries. More than enough for a dinner salad so I took half home. I ordered the fresh baked salmon. It came on a cedar plank and it was grilled to perfection. Along side of it were fresh roasted carrots asparagus potatoes and what I believe we're golden beets. Everything was tasty but I needed to save room for their infamous desserts so I packed half my meal away. Finally what I waited for all evening dessert. Tiny little shot glasses of pure heaven. 7 different choices and I could only select 2. Agh what a decision. First I picked the key lime pie. Wow. Perfect no other words. Then I ate the chocolate mousse s'more. Pure heaven. Next time I go I will only order the desserts. One of each!!!  Service was good but our waiter was a bit strange and I think he was trying too hard. Either way food was awesome!!!  Best of all they serve Schramsberg wines."}
{"text":"Best cocktails. We decided to have a shot of the vanilla honey tequila and it was amazing! We'll be going back asap. The atmosphere is romantic and inviting."}
{"text":"Our server Russ was absolutely top notch!  Food and specialty drinks were phenomenal. Ambiance wonderful."}
{"text":"I need to preface this by saying that this review was taken from 3 to 4 stars by way of dessert, but I'll get into that later.  

I was invited to check out Seasons 52 last Thursday evening with a friend that I haven't seen in way too long and after checking out the menu online, it was a date! Seriously, google it, if your mouth doesn't water your a corpse.

Everyone's really excited about the 'everything under 475 calories' thing and I get it...I suppose that is a pretty statement move on Seasons part. I will say that everything we had also tasted like it had less than 475 calories, and while that's not necessarily a bad thing, I wouldn't come to Seasons for a steak if you know what I'm saying.....(i.e. filet mignon deserves a butter bath in my humble opinion) 

That said, I decided on the Caramelized  Sea Scallops with asparagus and sundried tomato pearl pasta (errrrr, Israeli Couscous) and my dining companion decided on.......wait for it........

The Mesquite-Grilled Filet Mignon with garlic mashed potatoes, vegetables and roasted mushrooms! Yep! 

I did actually get to try it and like I said, I wouldn't come here for a steak. I, however, am the snobbiest of steak snobs so take that for what it's worth. It also didn't look like a Filet to me, more of a well pounded out top sirloin. I'm not claiming any deception, it just looked odd. 

My scallops were quite tasty and even though I missed the flavor that butter searing produces I would definitely order them again. The asparagus and pasta were good though surely difficult to really 'mess up'. 

The wine list was decent and I'm impressed that Seasons offers alternative menus for those that are vegetarian/vegan or have certain allergies or intolerance. 

This is when secksi time comes into play and the reason for the fourth star. DESSERT!

Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse and Pumpkin Pie with Ginger Snap Crust. Holy mother these little guys were divine. Served in what appear to be shot glasses, this was the perfect amount of sweet and delicious for two people that just consumed probably the healthiest thing they've eaten all week. Very rich and heavy, clearly hitting the 'under 475 calorie' mark by size alone. 

The restaurant itself has a pretty standard chain look/feel to it, reminiscent of a slightly upscale Cheesecake Factory. The service was great. Our server, Samantha was adorable and bubbly and was armed with enough familiarity of the menu to answer our questions knowledgeably. 

All in all a good experience. I'd go back for a dessert and wine happy hour (or four) in a second."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal or service at Seasons 52.  Added Bonus:  They have a dairy free menu upon request, eating here is easy!  

We like the Grilled Chicken Flatbread, Organic Field Greens Salad and the Oak Grilled Filet Mignon.  The desserts come in the cutest shot glasses, so if you wanted to try 2, don't feel bad about it!

I would recommend sitting in the bar area to really enjoy the live piano music and you get the same level of service as if you sat in the main dining room."}
{"text":"This place is such a good place to visit on a Friday night after a busy work week. As soon as you enter you are greeted with a dark lit room and relaxing ambiance. My boyfriend and I were seated right away by a booth near the bar. 

Our waitress was very nice and friendly. She had great recommendations (I kept asking her what she thought between two entrees as well as dessert)
We had the shrimp scampi on the happy hour menu in a tasty tomato sauce that sweet and tangy. Definitely recommend it. For the entree I went with the Cedar Plank Salmon. It came perfectly cooked with a tangy sauce on the side and fresh seasoned vegetables. My bf had the Halibut and really enjoyed that. I liked how his dish was presented with the white fish on a dark bed of black rice. 

Now for the best part! When we thought we couldn't take any more food the waitress comes back with elegant display of desserts in glass cups on a tray. At first I thought we didn't order this! Then she began describing each of the delectable flavors. We picked Mocha Macchiato and Raspherry Mascarpone topped with a Cannoli. Delicious! 

We will be back again"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner at Seasons 52!   The Sea Bass was fantastic!  Our waiter Jon paired it with a nice wine.  The Shrimp and grits were also delicious!  Nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Love this place. Joy decided on Seasons 52 for our last Happy Hour get together of 2013. We arrived at 3:45pm (Dec. 31st) -- Hostess was a bit bitchy and rude. Once we were seated we no longer had to worry about her. We were served our drinks and appetizers by an awesome server (I wish I could remember her name). She then informed us that Danielle G. would take over as our server. She was incredible as well. Food was amazing. Desserts were tasty and just the right amount as to not affect my Size 4 figure.

This is another fave Happy Hour & Dinner place for 2014! Cheers***"}
{"text":"Seasons 52 is located in the Biltmore and very popular with the workforce lunch crowd. Darden restaurants pride themselves for getting patrons in and out in a quick fashion at lunch time. This is the reason they got 1 of the 2 stars. The other star comes from our serve who on the whole was fantastic. She would've gotten an extra (3rd) star if she had been more proactive during her serving. She was super friendly and (as expected) asked if we were under time constraints for lunch. Seasons 52 is located right near a parking lot where it's free 2 hour parking with validation. Our server or the hostess should have the awareness that their customers will utilize this parking and should always ask if you need validation, I shouldn't have to ask when I walk in or out about it. It should be an automatic response. I ordered my Flat Iron Steak Salad and requested no blue cheese crumbles. This is a very simple modification to make using a few buttons on their POS system, I know because I've worked in a Darden restaurant in the past. As you might gather, my salad came out with blue cheese crumbles and I had to send it back. It was returned to me after roughly 3-5 minutes. I could tell that all they did was to remove the blue cheese crumbles because I still found pieces of it in my salad. I was able to just pick around them and eat the salad. The steak was cooked perfectly and I was very pleased with the dressing that came with it, the small portion was a little ridiculous but I dealt with that. Halfway through eating my salad I discovered there was a live bug in my salad, needless to say I immediately pushed aside my meal and was done. The server hadn't been back to check on us in a while and when she finally did come back I let her know that there was a bug in my salad and pointed it out. She was absolutely mortified, apologetic, and grossed out. She immediately took it back to the kitchen and sent the manager out to talk with me. The manager was very unapologetic and insincere. She said, \"When you have fresh farm grown organic food, this is bound to happen.\" I was completely put off by this response and hence the reason for my review. My meal and appetizer we're comp'd and was given a $25 gift certificate to come back. I will definitely not be going back to this establishment again. Thankfully they are apart of Darden and I will use the $25 at another restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar...place was hopping.  Good food.  No beer on tap but carried a lot of local selections.  Thoroughly enjoyed it, had a couple of appetizers for dinner.  Ahi tuna roll and black bean soup.  Both were excellently done and well plated.

The live piano entertainment behind the bar was very good as well, I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. Lovely patio, a great place to relax and enjoy a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"So much better this time around! Thank you seasons 52 for showing us how delicious you really are! We will be back."}
{"text":"Seasons 52 has THE very best trout in Arizona!!! They have a nice wine list as well!  Then enjoy one of their mini desserts!!"}
{"text":"I went for restaurant week and it was the absolute best deal - three courses large portions and the winetasting to accompany it was outstanding. Waiter was good too."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place. It keeps things simple by telling you that all the items on the menu are 475 calories or less. This way you can just order and relax and noot sound like \" could you pls just put my dressing on the side, grilled instead of fried pls, ect.\"  Our waiter james was awesome-  prompt and funny. Last thier piano bar singer was phenomenal. Will be back as soon as we can convince a family member to watch our kids again."}
{"text":"Took my daughters MIL here for a belated birthday lunch.  Both of us are healthy eaters and Seasons did not let us down.  Our server offered to switch out the lavish for fresh veggies with the hummus dip.  When the veggies arrived they smelled amazing.  You could smell the fresh cucumbers as soon as it was set on the table.  We both opted for the salad with goat cheese and had asked for our dressing to be on the side but when the salads arrived, they were both dressed.  Our server offered to take them both back but we declined.  Salads were excellent, perfect size for lunch.  Server could have been a little more friendly but was very attentive.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I believe that the initial nostalgia of Seasons 52 has finally worn off for me.  There are many things that I like and still appreciate about this place but I am no longer wowed by it.

What I still appreciate:

- The fact that while they have some staple items, they still have a large seasonal menu that is always full of interesting and fresh selections
- The service is always spot on when I go and the AZ location didn't let me down either.  From the initial greeting at the door, to the ongoing service to the final goodbyes called from the bar when you are leaving the door, we appreciated it all.
- I can still respect the fact that the food is calorie-managed for you.  If I could afford it, I'd eat here for dinner every night just so that I didn't have to count my calories
- Their alcoholic beverages are still my favorite part of the menu and I love the fact that you end up with a drink and a half in your martini mixer. =)
- Their desserts (while small) are delicious!)

What has worn thin:

- While I understand that the calories are managed tightly here, in some ways, so is the flavor.  We had the ahi tuna sashimi, lamb chops and filet Mignon and while all had decent flavors, none of them really popped in my mouth.  When we placed our lamb and steak dishes together they looked almost identical (see picture).  We did however love the Hawaiian martini and dessert shooters. 
- For what you get, their prices can still be a little questionable and are all over the place.
- They have a larger drink menu than they do food.  While I don't mind liquid lunches, you sometimes wish they got a little more creative with their overall menu selections.

Seasons 52 is a wonderful concept and I love the fact that their food is healthy and proportioned the way us chubby Americans needs to eat.  With a little menu updating, I think this can still continue to be a place that I prefer to dine at.

Oh, the piano bar singer is always a riot.  I've been to locations here in Phoenix, Chicago and Atlanta and I always love the swanky crooning of updated hits softly breezing through the restaurant."}
{"text":"So... I like the idea of a restaurant that is calorie conscious, without sacrificing taste. Initially, I though Season's did a reasonable job executing on this - particularly with the crab/shrimp stuff mushrooms and key lime pie. 

During a separate visit, however, I had a less than desirable meal - bland sandwich paired with an equally bland salad. I'm only letting this fiasco moderately impact my star review as I was there for a group lunch event (preplanned menu). I think the sales staff / management could have done a better job planning the menu to tempt the 30 non-regulars to come back for more. They failed. 

If you do go when the weather cools down, check out the patio for sure.  The inside is a bit too large and dark for my taste."}
{"text":"FRESH (in season ingredients), FLAVORFUL,  healthier alternative without sacrifice!!!!! YES!!!! Check
Food (overall) GREAT!  Check

Good: 
Garlic Chicken Flatbread.

Tasty, awesome price and perfectly satisfied me:  
Spicy Tandoori Chicken Skewers w/ fresh mango chutney & cucumber herb raita (normally I don't like chutney but the mango was so fresh and flavorful I DEVOURED it) and normally with organic mixed greens salad (but I was hankering for the Kalymnos Greek Salad and they were fabulous to switch it for me).

Perfectly cooked, tender, mouth-watering w/ a kick-y drizzle of the chipotle sour cream:
Grilled Buffalo Steak w/green veg trio, fresh corn, roasted mushrooms and chipotle sour cream.

Drinks good.  Check 
Ambience FAB!  Check

{"text":"Came in last night for the first time for a friend's birthday dinner.  We had reservations for 7pm. They had our table ready as soon as we got there. They even had a little card ready for the birthday girl.  Ambiance was nice, loved the table and wall decor. Ordered the hummus appetizer and the filet mignon. Everything was delicious. Had a little carmel machiatto dessert which was the perfect end to the dinner. Our waitress, I believe Karen was her name,  was super sweet and very attentive. Thank you for a great 1st experience!"}
{"text":"1) Order the Lobster flatbread, enough said.

2) The menu is amazing and I love how they list how  many calories is in each meal for those who are watching their calorie intake.

3) Chilean sea bass is OUT OF THIS WORLD! (Gotta order it, melts in your mouth)

4) Scallops are as equally awesome as the Chilean sea bass. 

You can't go wrong here, it's a beautiful venue with an equally beautiful menu."}
{"text":"I ate at Seasons 52 last week and it was a fantastic dining experience and great service. I had great service and food. I started with a steak and blue cheese flatbread (so much we had to get a togo bag) , then an incredible spinach salad with fresh pears. The entrees we chose the filet and pork (both cooked to expectation and perfection). I'm always amazed with the \"mini\" desserts, we shared a triple chocolate and the key lime pie versions... awesome!"}
{"text":"Wanted to take my mom out for a farewell visit lunch & decided to give Seasons 52 a whirl. What a great choice!! Jason, our waiter was very attentive. We ordered the lump crab, roasted shrimp & spinach stuffed mushrooms. They were tasty, but unfortunately there was a piece of shell in one of my bites. My mom ordered the special Wild Alaskan Salmon w/snap peas & corn risotto. She loved all of it except for the risotto, is wasn't as creamy & still had some \"tooth\" to it. I ordered the Oak Grilled Filet Mignon w/roasted mushrooms, Yukon golden mash & roasted asparagus. Mushrooms were a bit burnt, asparagus fiberous & mash potatoes salty. The filet was delicious and tender-ordered medium, cooked perfectly. For desserts mom chose the Amaretto shooter & I decided on the Raspberry Cannoli shooter-both yummy. Will definitely return to try other items on the menu!!"}
{"text":"So good it hurts. Busy Friday night, restaurant week, and the restaurant performs flawlessly.

Short ribs, filet, veggie plate and shrimp and grits and just awesome. Daniel was our server and you just won't find better in this incredible food city. 

Flawless execution."}
{"text":"We made Mother's Day reservations hoping to find our \"new\" spot for celebrations.  We won't be returning.   Even \"with\" reservations, we waited 20 minutes for our table.  I gave them two stars because today is Mother's Day and they were understandably busy.   However, Mother's Day isn't a surprise (it happens every year, folks)  and the entire experience here had the frantic energy of survival mode.  Poor planning, poor training and poor service.

Once we were seated, our main server was friendly but couldn't answer one, not one, of the questions we had.  I asked if there were any noodles or high carb items in the shrimp scampi and was told there were 'noodle things' in the dish, but he wasn't sure what they were.   He did the right thing and went to ask.   The 'noodle things' in the dish were actually spiralized zucchini.  I appreciate the low-carb option, but that should have been a question \"easily\" answered by someone with a modicum of experience at this restaurant.   Truly, it seems if they hired inexperienced staff members just to cover this day and forgot to train them.   We waited an hour and 10 minutes for our food and it was \"okay.\"   During the wait, no one checked on us.  No one updated us on the ridiculous wait.   I would have been much more patient had anyone just acknowledged the situation.  

The salmon dish I ordered typically comes with potatoes.  I asked to sub out for double veggies.   I should have asked for quadruple veggies.    The sub out for double veggies was SIX asparagus spears.  Six.   Sooo...your standard veggie amount is 3 spears.    Skimpy and a poor value for the price.

Our drinks were gone a few times and when a different person came around to fill them, she was more than comfortable reaching directly \"over\" a plate to reach the glass.  Without so much as a, \"pardon my reach,\" as she nearly brushed her wrist and forearm across our meals.  I tried to watch for her arrival and bring the glasses to her to spare her future reaching episodes.  

The meal ended with a different person bringing around a tray of shot-glass size desserts.   The hand-held flashlight highlighted each option and I thought the presentation was a clever way to show off a 3D menu of the dessert options.  I didn't realize the miniature samples were *actually* the desserts.    I thought given our extraordinarily long weight, the desserts would have been included, but I was wrong.  The dessert \"samples\" were actually $3.00 each.

I so wanted this place to be amazing, especially since it's within 200 yards of quality powerhouses such as Capital Grille.    We won't be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is slowly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in town.  I came here for the first time taking a friend here for her birthday lunch and was pleasantly surprised (not by the beautiful interior) but how comfortable I felt in this beautiful interior.  

I felt at ease, the waitress was knowledgeable, not too intrusive and very welcoming.  My friend got the braised beef wrap with kale soup and I got the fish tacos.  Both came beautifully presented and delicious.

Since then I have been back twice more and have since gotten their flat bread, roasted artichoke hearts, mushroom stuffed with mushroom . . . anything I've had here, I have made a mental to order again next time!

Thoroughly enjoyable atmosphere and food.  5 Yelp stars up!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Season's 52, worth my introduction to it in Indianapolis. I love that the menu changes throughout the year and that they support farmers. I've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food and menu were good but not great. I loved the concept of being under 475 calories however most of the group felt they didn't get enough food with their entrees, especially for price. Service was also just okay. Doubt I will return."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and food - fine dining at a reasonable price!  Our awesome server Bethany was incredibly kind and knowledgeable about the wine lists and the menu.  Their cauliflower and Brussels sprouts appetizers were perfectly seasoned and flavorful.  Our party of four ordered 2 salmon dishes, one rainbow trout, and one sea scallops- all were divine!  Perfectly cooked, seasoned, perfect portions!  And the dessert shooters are pretty legit too (two giant spoonfuls of pecan pie for the win!).  You will regret NOT going to this place if you're in the area - we will definitely be back on our next trip to Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"Where shall I start. 

ON Jan 3st I made a reservation thru opentable for march 4th for a group of 10ppl. March 4th comes. Season 52 first couldnt find this reservation, then my group was placed at a table of 5 while they clear more tables for larger parties. My group arrives they then push a SQUARE small table to connect to a LARGE circle table. We squeeze 5 more into our table. The food arrives and the shrimp and grits were not grits. Its like they just threw shimp into random veggies for both.Totally not worth $20. The mac n cheese was gross because of the truffles. Shrimp scampi was canned tomatoes and like 4 shrimps on a fried rissotto partty! Which burnt my friends tongue n throat!. I will say they tried to accommodate us the best they could and gave us a free first round of appetizers and drinks for everyone due to the mix up, but this certainly would not be a recommendation in my book

OH And we had to wait damn near an HOUR for our food!"}
{"text":"The food isn't bad. I'm not sure how many places you can get quail, and, you know, it was tasty.

But this whole \"we only use seasonal ingredients\" is kind of a load. It's not like Seasons 52 is using local produce or organic meat. \"Seasonal ingredients\" simply means the produce they buy is in season, which also means it's cheap. That would be fine if the savings were passed on to you, but they're not. I'd be curious what their markup is. This place is pretty damn expensive for what you get.

The whole low less-than-850 calories thing was nice. Portion control is a good thing, and my meal was filling. Just wish I didn't have to pay that much."}
{"text":"The servers were horrible. Couldn't take order correctly and then billed me incorrectly as well. The food was overpriced for the poor quality we got. Never going back."}
{"text":"Seasons 52 is always our \"go to\" spot for dinner when we can't decide what to eat because there is always something we will both enjoy here. Service is always excellent and I love the fact everything on the menu is less than 500 calories. The shrimp flatbread is an excellent started. With the ever changing menu, i always try to find one of the shrimp dishes and have yet to be disappointed. Good quality food and good service makes this one of my favorite places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I went for my birthday a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It made me think of going to those romantic restaurant spots my husband and I would frequent in Vegas. I used the yelp check in and got a free appetizer, the shrimp scampi skillet. It was sooo good. I would probably just order it in itself next time. Then the main course, I had the lobster flatbread and my husband had the salmon. Both were very good. The salmon was flavorful and soft. The best part was the free dessert I got to choose! I tasted the smores - my favorite and the cheesecake. It wasn't as great. But had another. The service was sometimes a bit aloof and a little inattentive as we waited with our glasses empty for a bit until they came and refilled it. Other than that, it was good and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Um.
HOLY CRAP WAS MY BUFFALO BURGER GOOD!
And for under 475 calories?!

LOVE IT.
Will return.  Wish I could return everyday for every meal.

Service was a bit over the top/cheesy.  But whatever.
The food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent Value for Money paid.  The food was well prepared, served in a timely fashion, and overall a highly recommended place for clean and healthy food that won't break the bank.  Service was great, ambiance and location in the Biltmore add a nice touch of class."}
{"text":"A subpar meal at a usually consistent and on the ball restaurant.  While normally great for lunch, weekend dinners are to be avoided. Crowds, delays, understaffing, and an overwhelmed kitchen are all reasons to stay away on a Saturday night. Sure, the flatbreads, salads, and entrees are great as always - not to mention that decadent three bite dessert options - but the chaos just isn't worth it.  Stick to weekday lunches and everything will be fine.  The weekend... not so much."}
{"text":"Different than before, but still yummy and light.

We hadn't been since last fall, but popped in a Friday night for a nice dinner out.  The restaurant has moved down-market a bit (not a bad thing).   Gone are the high-end steakhouse touches (white table cloths, combing the table for crumbs, etc.), and the menu prices are a bit lower (not too many items over $30 on what is a pretty sophisticated/upscale-sounding menu).  They've also gone to pre-fab desserts in a glass (again, not necessarily a bad thing).

As before, all their items are less than like 500 calories - but their portions are not small by any means.   Very cool.

My wife had a filet (quite good), and I had the sesame encrusted swordfish - also quite awesome.

The highlight though, had to be the seasonal cocktail - cranberry & sage.  It's gin, white cranberry juice, soda, cranberries, and candied sage.  It's conceptually reminiscent of a mojito, and is crazy good (not too sweet, very refreshing).  It's also incredibly visually appealing.  It's a must-have.

Maybe it's the whole Olive-Garden association in my head, but I always forget how good this place is, and now that it's become a bit less upscale, I think we'll be visiting more often."}
{"text":"We're typically not fans of chain restaurants but Seasons 52 is an exception. The selections are fresh and changes often. They pride themselves in offering dishes that are under 500 cal (but that adds up quickly if you get a starter, app, entrée & dessert!). The lamb kefta starter was very good - but could have used more tzatziki and Greek 'salsa'; the lumb crab roasted shrimp & spinach stuffed mushrooms were awesome! The spinach salad w/strawberries & pine nuts was also good, but lacking in the berry department. The stuffed Mediterranean sea bass was beautifully presented and prepared perfectly. There was live music from the bar area wafting through the dining areas which was a nice touch. The staff was super friendly and attentive. This is a restaurant of consistent high quality presentations and knowledgeable and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I went a few months ago for the grand opening and decided to venture back to see if my first impression was still validated.... Absolutely!!! I love this place. Especially the fact that everything is under 475 calories. IMO, I don't think that anything tastes like it has been trimmed back for calorie content. I got a greek salad to start, my main course was the Fliet Mingion with mashed potatoes and rosted veggies. and the Rocky Road mini dessert. Delicious!!  For a Tuesday night the place was packed! We grabbed the last two bar stools and waited for 30 mins until a booth in the bar opened up. Next time I will definitely make reservations."}
{"text":"When I cook and fail it's still better than Seasons 52. 
Looking for great food in upscale settings within a walking distance? Go to Hillstone just East of 26th st."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and staying at the Biltmore. My husband had the rack of lamb and I had the filet mignon. Both were wonderful entrees. The cocktails were great. The salads were good except my husband ordered a watermelon and heirloom tomato salad with feta cheese and never really got it. Our server came back after he was done and asked how it was. It was great but no feta. She said she'd bring one complete salad back done the right way and when she came back she brought watermelon and feta but no heirloom tomatoes. So really we never did get to try the whole salad as advertised but only bits and pieces. So we expected that we wouldn't be charged for an item that we didn't get but clearly they had all of the ingredients for but were charged for it. We would of given this restaurant a five but the server was distracted and disinterested. She really acted like she could care less about our experience. We'd go back again because the food is that good but we'd sit in the bar."}
{"text":"Amazing food reasonable prices and fabulous service  ask for Karen! Finally quality food that feels healthy and fresh!"}
{"text":"It was my first experience at a Seasons 52 restaurant. My husband had dined at the one in Atlanta, so when it was close by at meal time and had good reviews, I was game to give it a try! 
The weather was amazing so we chose to dine outdoors. They have two outdoor dining options. One facing the parking lot by the front entrance and one off the back of the restaurant to the inside of the outdoor shopping mall. They aren't going to be great for \"outdoor ambiance\", but on a nice day they are still outside. 

We didn't have a reservation but were still seated immediately. Our waiter was very friendly and explained to use the two different menus they offered. My husband chose to go with the Prix Fixe menu and I did the regular menu. 
 My husband had a salad, the fish and the peanut butter dessert.
 I  am a sucker for a good flatbread and the asparagus and prosciutto was calling my name. The moment the server recommended it, I knew I had to try it! It was everything I'd hoped for-Crispy crust, thinly sliced asparagus, the right amount of cheese and prosciutto. For my main course I went with the filet, which came with asparagus and mashed potatoes. It was really good! I did the s'mores dessert shooter and it was the perfect way to round out the meal. 
I'd absolutely dine at a Seasons 52 restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Great concept! Awesome Atmosphere! Excellent Service! AND, oh yeah, a pianist in the middle of their bar! 

My friend and I came in when they were busy. The hostess said that it would be about 15-20 mins. It only took about 3. We ended up sitting in the lounge area. Very nice lighting. We were greeted by our server, Trey. 

He was very knowledgeable about the menu. He asked if we had been there before. Trey broke down the meaning of the restaurant's name and told us about how all of the food was seasonally inspired and less than 475 calories. We ordered our Iced teas and took a look at the menu.

I was instantly drawn to the Mountain Chicken. My friend decided on the Garlic Shrimp with Saffron Risotto. We didn't know what to start with so we let Trey surprise us with one of the Flat Breads. 

Upon arrival of the Goat Cheese and Artichoke FB I was impressed by the presentation. It looks big, at first. But when I had my first bite it was very light and flavorful. GOOD CHOICE TREY! 

After leaving not a crumb of the FB we moved on to the main Course. My Chicken dish was very well prepared. The Glaze lit up my taste buds. That was definitely the highlight. It almost had a BBQ sauce overtone but was much more enlightening. 

My friend's Shrimp and Risotto was quite the dish. I tried a bit of each and I loved how the risotto wasn't too creamy. The Shrimp was done just right. 

I would highly suggest Seasons 52. Service is great and the presentation is on point. KUDOS TREY!"}
{"text":"Great food, really great service! The ambiance is nice and cozy.  Good music.  Convenient walking distance to the Hampton Inn  where we were staying."}
{"text":"Kind and friendly staff. Tasty appetizers. Prices are mostly reasonable. Check out this place during off-peak times to avoid crowds."}
{"text":"The food was great and my experience was amazing. My servers were so kind and helpful and they really assisted me for my order. The appetizers were so tasty and also it just melted in my mouth, so good so perfect I had a great time and I highly recommend coming its perfect for family and for a date."}
{"text":"Food was not good... and we were hungry ! Deco is outdated. 
Service was good. But really the food was tasteless and not appealing ."}
{"text":"We recently dined here for the first time and had an enjoyable experience with friends.  Started off a little rocky because we arrived for our reservations only to be told open table had 'double booked' and they were seating 30 mins later.  That was a little irritating but not a deal breaker.  We were seated at the intimate little table when you first enter the restaurant which was perfect for our party of 10.  We were all able to pleasantly enjoy conversation with one another.  Our server Dino was fantastic and made the evening even better.  
Seasons 52 is about fresh, seasonal food and I will say they hit the mark.  All the food was delicious, my scallops were cooked perfectly with greatly flavors and my husband was very pleased with his meal. I would say the only drawback is the servings are quite small-and pricey.  I hear they pride themselves on smaller-low calorie portions.  While delicious, I am not sure the food is anything so outstanding that I am dying to return anytime soon, but we still enjoyed our meal. 
Try the mini desserts-they're yummy!"}
{"text":"EVERYTHING ON THE MENU IS UNDER 475 CALORIES!  That itself is a feat let alone making the food taste good and Seasons 52 succeeded on  all counts.  I am use to going out for dinner and realizing that I can only afford to do it Friday or Sat (once a week) because chances are I'm about to eat 3000 + calories on delicious food at a fine restaurant and I don't want to get so fat I would require wheel chair access (no offence people who are actually handicapped or fat due to genetics, I'm sorry its not your fault).  So finding a place like this that actually has amazing food that's healthy is AMAZING.  I had the buffalo burger which was delicious and full of so many flavors as well as the Basil and Parmesan cheese flat bread, my dining mate I was with had the Farmers Market Vegetable Plate which can be described the following ways, adorable, ambrosial, appetizing, choice, dainty, darling, delectable, delightful, delish, distinctive, divine, enjoyable, enticing, exquisite, fit for king, good, gratifying, heavenly, luscious, lush, mellow, mouthwatering, nectarous, nice, palatable, piquant, pleasant, rare, rich, sapid, savory, scrumptious, spicy, sweet, tasteful, tasty, tempting, titillating, toothsome, well-prepared, well-seasoned, yummy. (yes those are synonyms for delicious).  The servers were also GREAT and full of valuable and helpful information, our server was Madison M. I remember because the servers have business cards which is cool as well as unnecessary (although now I feel i have to ask for them next time I go in, which is fine because they were great).  Super excited to try the many other menu options as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Expensive for what it is, gimmick of low calorie meals, left very hungry with a small dish (I guess that's the point)"}
{"text":"It's fancy as fudge. It's good for people who have a big bank account and are 40+ of age"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this restaurant for about a year and finally got to go there to celebrate my birthday!  This is a beautiful restaurant!  The atmosphere is very warm.  I made a reservation for four of us and were seated about 5 minutes after we got in.  Our server was extremely polite and professional.  I asked her for a suggestion for a drink.  She suggested the strawberry basil martini.  It was not strong at all and I prefer a stronger drink (please don't judge me)!  Next I tried the pineapple hawaiian martini.  Loved it!  It was extremely refreshing and not too weak or too strong.
We ordered the steak and cremini mushroom flatbread.  I would order that again!  Next I ordered the Tiger Shrimp pasta as my entree.  The shrimp was well seasoned and the pasta and veggies were very lightly dressed.  I prefer and heavy unhealthy sauce, but this is not the place for that.  Entrees are under 475 calories I think.  So if you want a great place to have a healthy meal, this is the place.  I did get a free dessert since it was my birthday.  The desserts are tiny individual sized portions that are beautifully displayed.  I chose the one that was most like tiramisu.  I was delicious!
Afterward, I had a drink at the bar with a friend and once again, we received excellent service.  Its nice to go to a restaurant that still values their customers!"}
{"text":"Not going to try and act like a food critic here! If you are looking to try this place, then you already know about Seasons 52. Wife, daughter, and myself came here on a Saturday for our wedding anniversary! I had their chili, and buffalo burger. I was amazed how moist and good the burger was. Wife and daughter had flat breads! Over all place was very good and if you are looking into eating healthier. Place is a good choice!"}
{"text":"We came for dinner tonight. The restaurant was quite dark, too dark to see the menu. Nice atmosphere, nice wine list. The service was excellent, quick and attentive. We were a large party and were seated right away with a reservation. We all had flat breads to start with cocktails. The goat cheese and artichoke flatbread was excellent but the lobster was just ok. I had a pomegranate margarita/martini that was excellent. I ordered the tuna tartar and it was good, was not expecting the avocado underneath. The rack of lamb was cooked to perfection however it could have used a little more seasoning. All in all we had a great time and the food was good."}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever been to a Seasons 52 and not rated them a 5 Star. They have truly hit the formula for quality, health, and price. Plus, the cocktail menu is superior. I was disappointed they had run out of one of the items to make a specialty drink. Cranberries I think it was, but instead I had their custom version of an old fashioned. 

It was awesome. They added a sugar (rock) candy stir for effect and taste. It was a truly delicious cocktail. Then, we went with the whole roasted cauliflower appetizer. I am absolutely recommending this now to everyone. They add just a dusting of Cheese, but it's mostly flavored by the grill. 

Then, I had the rainbow trout at the recommending of my server. I was going to have have the veggie plate, but she insisted. It was fantastic. Cooked just right and the smashed potatoes worth every calorie!!

For sure go here next time you are in camelback!"}
{"text":"So delish!! Had a great experience here with some girlfriends for Phoenix restaurant week! 

They have a pianist that playing relaxing music in the middle of the bar. If you are looking for a nice dinner, with reasonable $$, and great service then check out Seasons 52!!"}
{"text":"For me Seasons 52 is like getting a cheat code for your favorite video game.  Sure it allows you to save the princess but it doesn't quite feel like you earned it.  My meal, the Salmon, tasted so good that I needed quite a bit of prodding to be convinced that the entire thing was under 400 calories.  I mean 400 calories should taste like cardboard and thistle.  This was downright pleasant.  Eating good just got a lot easier.

Don't let the steakhouse decor fool you.  There's no creamed spinach or fatty porterhouse here, just a festival of flavor that is untainted by unnecessary grease, butter, or excessive meddling."}
{"text":"The chef is to be commended. Considering there are no meal items over 475 calories, the food is delicious. I had the chile relleno appetizer with goat cheese and pico de gallo. It was perfect! I followed with the pork tenderloin entree and Wow!!!! Another home run. The service was a bit slow, but they were really busy so I guess it was worth the wait. I will definitely be back and I do recommend you try Seasons 52 for a special dining experience."}
{"text":"It was my first time to Seasons52 and I have worked at the Biltmore Fashion Square for many years!! Do I feel foolish!! Heard from several customers that it was amazing and the desserts were in shot glasses on many occasions. Well this evening my fiancé and I gave it a try after closing the boutique!! What a Treat!! Great atmosphere that is romantic! Service is warm and welcoming with a genuine desire to please! And please they Do!! My tastebuds were very pleased!! First the flatbread with Lobster- superb! I had the warm caprese salad and my fiancé the pork loin and shrimp! Everything was fresh, presented well and the flavors danced in my mouth!! Sharing pictures so you can Feast your eyes on the goodies that await you!! And yes...the shot glass desserts are the Bomb!!"}
{"text":"The Lamb was delicious, some of the best I've ever had.  The seasonal veggies were grilled to perfection and included something called a Fiddlehead Fern which was amazing!   The service was great and so was my Dirty Martini.  I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. And our server Alexandra!  Warm yellow beet salad followed by two simple grilled lobster tails. Perfect flavors and SO nice to find a restaurant that doesn't feel like it has to feed you enough for a family of four one one plate.  Great concept and totally surprised this is a Darden restaurant."}
{"text":"First, let's put something to rest shall we and agree on one thing - Phoenix has seasons. It may not be known to the rest of America, but it's not all dry heat. At Seasons 52, their menu changes with the season of what's fresh in the market.

WHY GO THERE? 475 calories for your main course - and pretty much all on their menu. It's dining without the guilt of fattening yourself up. The serving portion is just enough, with no room for leftover.

WHATCHAGOT? We were there for lunch. The garlic chicken flatbread was seasoned well but left much to be desired with the little morsels of white meat. The buffalo burger was satisfying, and the grilled chicken skewer tasty. Though food was shared, I bet I exceeded my 475-calorie intake.

YOU GOT SERVED. The waiter was friendly and prompt. What I don't get is the maitre d' who told us 15 minutes wait unless we opt for bar seating? Five minutes we were seated on a booth, and noticed there were several tables that were empty.  Really now? Creating the illusion of waiting does not make a restaurant hot in any season."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's heaven for healthy eaters and for everyone alike!  

I've always enjoyed meals there, I find them filling, tasty and very satisfying.  I love that they bring in local foods and wines too - one of my favorite Arizona wines (Tazi - white blend!) is always in stock here.    The ambiance is lovely too - I am so in love with the piano behind the bar and the wonderful musicians they have!!  

The thing that's best about this place is that the food is always so flavorful and there is no guilt or remorse for eating too much or eating food that makes you feel overly full later.    Often I leave here with leftovers too, so portions are still filling.  My favorite meal is the Scallops by far, always so good!   The filet won't lead you astray either. 

I was doing HCG and hadn't eaten out in months.  I called ahead and asked if the chef could prepare a meal with no oil, no sugar, no dairy and lo and behold they happily agreed.  This was the first restaurant that said 'no problem!'   

I ordered jumbo shrimp and it came well seasoned and with assurance that it was prepared to order.  The meal was simply delicious and I had no guilt for being off-track on my eating plan.  I've been back a few times in the past 6 months and visited other Seasons 52 restaurants in DC and Chicago and have always had no issues getting meals prepared as requested.  I even asked for a smaller portion of steak during dinner and they served me a smaller portion here at the restaurant at the Biltmore.  

For anyone that has been trying to eat healthy and find a great place to go - Seasons 52 is definitely the magical place!"}
{"text":"My dear friend and I went to Season's 52 for lunch.  Ken was our server and he made the whole experience especially wonderful.  Great food, comfy booth and very pretty surroundings.  If you go, ask for Ken.  He is personality plus and he will make sure you enjoy every minute of your dining experience.  I love the menu and its variety of choices to suit various dietary preferences."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and was based upon other reviews. Our experience was very positive from the moment we entered. They were prepared for us even though they were very busy - on a Monday night! Without a reservation, the wait was 45\". Not only did the front desk know, but our waitperson Mina knew as well. The atmosphere was beautiful wood with the right level of lighting. Mina added to our dining pleasure with her suggestions and excellent service. Both my wife and I had the lamb chops, which were well prepared. Theresa Coe added to our enjoyment at the piano. To our surprise, she even knew \"our song\", Somewhere in Time. We enjoyed fine dining for over two hours - although we didn't realize the time until we left. Highly recommend Seasons 52."}
{"text":"Every two weeks I meet with a group of friends at Seasons 52. We get to dine in Biltmore Fashion Park and we enjoy a tasty menu of beautiful healthy food for around $10 bucks a plate (some for less).

The service is consistently outstanding and that's not easy to do with a large group. The food is served on time, it's always hot, and it never disapoints."}
{"text":"Went with a large group on Tuesday. Sampled many of the great appetizers and desserts but the main courses were well received. So good that I decided Seasons 52 would be the place for our 35th anniversary dinner on the weekend. Highly recommend the scallops with risotto."}
{"text":"Went for Thanksgiving dinner and really enjoyed it. Excellent service and meal. Reviewed the regular menu and cannot wait to return to try that. Broad menu, interesting wines and a nice dining room. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place was REALLY good. The grill at Stingray was broken so we went over to Seasons 52. A very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant. Have been here so many times. The bar is inviting great happy hour. And the dining experience is top notch. We just had a celebration last night with our family 12 of us all the food was perfect.  Channing our server is amazing amazing. Went out of her way to make the experience great"}
{"text":"I didn't want to write a review until I finished my special tasting.  It was very good, I only had a few problems...but we'll get there later.  This will be my first review since I have to go as a regular patron soon. This place has a very nice atmosphere and I love how they present their meny. Under 475 calories, but let's remember that's PER ITEM lol. that doesn't mean your whole meal will be reasonable.  You actually can go over your daily alotted calories ha! 
The tasting menu wasn't bad, I of course had to be the bad 'vegetarian' apple and ask for no chicken since a meatless dish wasn't provided. But they do have options for us veggies!
Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"great food, decent prices, and great menu selection. the service is also outstanding.  would return!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!  Tonight was our very first visit to Seasons 52 (what took us so long?!). The food was out of this world amazing. We had the roasted cauliflower, asparagus soup, sea scallops, filet mignon, and three of the best desserts ever!  (Yes, there were only two of us. Don't judge!!). But the hands-down BEST part?  Our server, Tommy!!! We sat on the patio on the perfect March evening and the moment Tommy walked out, we knew we were in for a treat! He was attentive, his suggestions were terrific, and he was on his game!  We never wanted for a thing. We will be back to Seasons 52 without a doubt and we will ask for Tommy!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for an early lunch with a friend.
We were seated promptly and the ladies by the door were very nice and friendly.

Food was good, I think very original options.

We were seated at the bar and service was... OK. 3 starts to service. Our server was OK but didn't look happy to be there, maybe he was just having a bad day.

We had a few items to share:
Flatbread - Spicy chipotle shrimp. I thought it was OK, I know it was a flatbread but it almost felt like saltines... : ( a little 'too flat' for my taste.
Blackened Mahi  Mahi Tacos - This were really good. Each taco had a big piece of fish. Good cilantro sour cream.
Quinoa grain and citrus salad (side salad) - This one was very good, but it seemed to me it had other main ingredient and less quinoa, seemed like wheat, ferro or something like that. Other than that it was delicious.  

We had some of the specialty drinks, the mint lemonade (that does not come with refills, even though I was initially told it did) it was way too sweet an I do not recommend it.

Aaaand, they have the small desserts in shot glasses...  I had the lemon one and my friend had the fresh fruit. The menu said key lime pie but our server corrected me saying it was 'lemon'... so I do not know if the one I got was not on the menu, but it was good.

I like these small desserts, and now that PF Chang's does not have them anymore, I may stop by at this place just for the desserts."}
{"text":"This place deserves a rare 5-star rating from me.  The food is great, and so is the service.  Price is about what you would expect at the Biltmore.

Great service points:  1. The hostess asked for my friend's last name upon entering, and referred to him as \"Mr. _______ \" and to me as \"Ms. Hughes\" for the entire time we were there.  2.  Upon seating us, the hostess looked at my black slacks and replaced the white linen napkin in front of me with a black one (SO AWESOME).  3.  The first thing the server asked us is if we were under any time constraints to get back to work, etc.  NICE TOUCH for a business day luncheon.

Things that have been said so far about Seasons 52 but deserve repeating:  1.  It definitely looks like Huston's inside, but it's a great vibe.  2.  Every item is under 475 calories!  There is no butter or deep fryer in the joint.  Therefore, the little dessert \"shots\" are a clever way of keeping dessert also under 475 calories. ;)

Additional items:  1.  They take reservations.  2.  There are multiple rooms for private parties and/or large groups.

If I had to change only one thing, it would be with the goat cheese ravioli that I ordered.  For me, the dough-to-goat cheese ratio was a little out of whack.  Meaning, far more goat cheese than dough.  I know that this execution of the dish is in keeping with the theme of decreasing carb intake, but it was A LOT of goat cheese.  The flavor was amazing, though, so I do need to state that this part of my review is based more on personal preference than on the chefs' skills.

I do need to mention that they have a great-- and surprisingly varied-- soup menu.  Especially now that the weather is getting colder, I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"Great food, upscale so be prepared to dress the part. Portions are a nice size especially for the calories, always have dessert--must have! My fave is the lemon flavor dessert"}
{"text":"Bad customer service experience!
So browsing through, the majority of the reviews regarding this restaurant is based on its food and actual dining experiences and i'll somehow give this restaurant props for that since not all chefs and staff are horrible. But let me share my experience with their management.

We've booked reservations for group dinners at Seasons52 previously, and yes their price is very steep. But oh well, we thought of giving them a try.
The setup process from the onset has been painful to deal with and they make us, as their clients, feel like we owe them. They demand updates and are difficult when it comes to making adjustments instead of making sure the entire process and experience is easy for us, their client. The way they communicate with us has been very short and demanding. (They probably think they're already pretty accomplished as an establishment so the heck does it matter to compromise customer service for a couple of clients) Smh!
Anyway, we let it slide as our guests were pleased the first time we were there. Staff and servers on the day of did their job.
So when we hosted another evening event at Seasons 52, we thought of going through them again and giving it another try. 

However, dealing with their management this time felt like it's a worse experience. I've been trying to get hold of Christina Burnett, their sales manager. Yup, that's what she was alright. All about the sales and not the service.
I could not get hold of her the first couple of days I've been calling the restaurant to setup our dinner, and no one else was able to take charge in her place. It was a good thing, I got the chance to speak to Earnesto who courteously took notes of my concerns and inquiry, shortly after, I then finally heard back from Christina.
(Took days to hear from someone. I mean if she can't be available, there must be someone else in charge ready to assist potential clients.)

I gave her details of our upcoming events and hoped we could work on pricing and negotiate on some requests (which our requests were not even farfetched. We still wanted keep it fair to the restaurant and not just us). But nope, prices were jacked up even higher. And instead of keeping recurring customers happy, she blatantly said they can't customize requests. And after reminding her of who we were and asking if we could at least keep the same agreement as before, we were ghosted. Not even a courtesy email to explain themselves. I find this very unprofessional and I feel like we were being treated less as customers. I did not want this for us and our guests anymore.

All worked out for the best. Since they took forever to take care of us, I found another restaurant that was willing to work with us. Everything is going seemless and we feel taken cared as customers at this other restaurant. I would rather put my money there than here. Yes, there are better restaurants in Phoenix than Seasons52.

I leave this review as it is and if it helps anyone going through the process as we were.
Hopefully, their management changes things because they've just lost us as customers. We will not be recommending this restaurant to our partners and clientele. Thanks for the experience!"}
{"text":"Ambience is nice, dim, you're able to have a conversation and not be drowned out by noise. Server wasnt as knowledgeable,  but she did find the answers to our questions,  made suggestions and was attentive.  Scallops didn't impress me but the quantity did. Fondue was tasty, sockeye was fresh, desserts perfect shot glass size, we sampled key lime, chocolate and cherry cheesecake i believe. Nice wine selection. I'll give them 1 more try..."}
{"text":"Went to happy hour.  The waiter at the bar was great!   Food was good.  Appetizer Sonoma goat cheese torta.  Entree  scallops with broccolini and asparagus.   Plus a glass of red wine."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently went to Phoenix for the weekend, and we ate at Seasons 52 since I had heard about it and we don't have one in CO, although we should!! I loved this place! The idea of having a menu where items are under 475 calories was awesome, because we like to go out to eat where the menu items are healthy, and so we didn't really have to worry about the nutritional content of what we were eating. The food was the best I have ever had from a restaurant, and the service was excellent!! They had live music, which was definitely unique. The only thing I would suggest, is err on the side of more dressy, because we looked it up here before and saw that it said casual and showed up a little under-dressed. The ambiance was awesome though. They have this cool fire pit thing when you walk in that looks neat. Overall, an excellent experience. If I lived closer, or there was one in CO, I'd go a lot!!"}
{"text":"Seasons 52 has been on our radar for about a year, but we just don't get into that part of Phoenix very often.  Our plans recently allowed us to visit the Biltmore Fashion Square location for lunch.  Interior appearance is very appealing with lots of dark wood, especially in the bar area.  Unfortunately, we were seated right next to the kitchen and even though my wife asked for another table we were told none were available as all were specifically reserved.  The hostess then explained for several minutes how some patrons have their special tables, blah, blah, blah.  Okay.  So we had to sit with my wife looking at the kitchen and me hearing all of the servers's conversations.  The menu is different from most restaurants you've been to in that it focuses on seasonally fresh and available items, with some standards always available, i.e., hamburger, shrimp scampi, and a few others.  We elected to graze and ordered to flatbreads, the steak and blue cheese, and the lobster.  I asked how big the shrimp scampi appetizer was and our waitress told us it was \"appetizer size.\"  Okay, we ordered it to split, thinking there would be 4 shrimp with it, which would have been fine.  The flatbreads came and they were very generous proportions.  We probably could have ordered just one and been full.  And they were delicious.  No questions about it, they were very tasty.  To our surprise the shrimp scampi appetizer contained 7 larger shrimp along with two pieces of bruscetta soaking up the juices.  That dish might have been the finest shrimp dish I've ever had.  It was delicious!  No questions asked.  We would definitely return here for happy hour and sit in the bar area, which is generous in size, and not have to worry about kitche noise.  We hope to do that soon.  Our only complaint was our server:  She never returned to the table to ask our our food was, she only brought replacement iced teas, which was nice, but never asked one questions about how our food was, nothing, nada, zip.  She did bring the shot glass desserts, though.  I had the key lime pie and my wife had the peanut butter chocolate.  They were both excellent.  And the portions were just perfect, not too much and not too little.  For $3 its the perfect dessert.  The server did ask how we liked our desserts.  Why that and not our main food I'll never know.  Regardless, this is a place we will return to even though its off our normal traveling/shopping areas."}
{"text":"under 475 calories for each dish....that is amazing! it just proves that you can have phenomenal, simple, yet healthy food and still feel full. 

we shared the yellow beet salad (delicious) and the ravioli app (again, delicious). then for my entree, i had the trout. it was so smooth and tender, i can't believe they didn't use an ounce of butter to cook it. the asparagus and carrots were expertly al-dente (i think that's how you spell it). my girls scallop dish was just as delicious. seared and tender just perfectly. 

we absolutely couldn't leave without trying a mini-desert dish. the pecan pie was heavenly in every scoop as was a (shared) key lime pie. 

a great restaurant. it's too bad it's a little on the pricey side. what would be great is to have a place like this so more people could see what good, healthy food can be. overall......best restaurant food i've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Not too long ago, I took my girlfriend to Seasons 52 for our anniversary.  I have read on other reviews that this is a great place for a special occasion.  I am delighted that I gave it a try, as it was a pleasant experience for both of us.

First, the atmosphere was ideal for a nice, romantic evening.  We received great service from the hostess and our waiter.  In fact, since I had mentioned it was our anniversary when I made a reservation, there was an anniversary card and two glasses of complimentary champagne ready for us as we sat down.  We enjoyed a shared appetizer dish:  the Artisan cheese fondue with cave-aged Gruyère, cheddar, and assorted breads.  We then ordered roasted chicken and grilled salmon for our two main entrees.  As one more special treat, we received a pair of mini indulgences for dessert.  I forget what my girlfriend got though I enjoyed the s'mores indulgent!  

I have gone back since (this morning) for brunch where they have a special new brunch menu and specials.  My girlfriend and I shared a caesar salad and a flatbread though our sets of parents ordered either salmon, salad, or steak.  While the coffee was a bit too bitter, the moment they mentioned something, a new pot was made right away and much improved.  Today's journey to Seasons 52 showed me that regardless of time of day or day of the week, they value their customers and make everyone feel like a special guest.  

The anniversary reservation was easy to make.  I used Open Table to score some points through the app (towards a gift card) though you can also make a reservation on their website.  I'd recommend signing up for the mailing list as you receive e-mail notifications of specials as well as coupons (like a recent one for $10 off $30 purchase).  Also, as we all love Yelp, check in on Yelp to receive a check-in offer for a free appetizer.  So many great deals that are easy to access for anyone!"}
{"text":"Great food and very tasty, plus you don't feel guilty or lazy after."}
{"text":"The thing I liked best about Seasons 52 was the atmosphere at the bar.  They have a talented (at least when I was there) woman playing a piano that is located behind the bar so everyone sitting at the bar can see the performance.

The food was decent, but not great.  I guess there thing is low calorie dining, which is fine, but not my thing when I am paying for a so-called nice meal.  The Seared Scallops were actually tasty, but the risotto accompaniment was flavorless and quite disappointing.  Not sure how you are supposed to make low-cal risotto though.  I ordered a Maine Lobster Tail as an extra side and it was puny, like an over sized craw-fish. 

I will probably go back and enjoy a drink at the bar, but skip the food and head to one of the other, better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"My good friend and I frequent Seasons and always enjoy ourselves. We typically sit at the bar and always receive excellent service. It's a nice perk to have menu items that are health conscious. Keep it up Seasons!"}
{"text":"I'm taking a journey through the Phoenix food scene, after moving from California, and so far I've been very pleased. My boyfriend and I went here to celebrate our transition and it was very classy. While not the biggest portions in the world, the food was great. And it wasn't as expensive as I expected. I approve."}
{"text":"Decor: very business-like: dark wood, muted colors, traditional style. Would be good for a lunch meeting. Also seems to be comfortable for an older crowd.

Food: Portions were great considering the caloric limit on their dishes. Everything was flavorful and fresh. I honestly expected to leave hungry and disappointed in a bland lunch, and that was not the case.

Service: Server was very friendly but completely overbearing. We were given way too much information each time she visited the table. As we were ordering, she commended us on our choices and talked about each element of the dish we wanted even though everything she was saying was printed on the menu. I've served in restaurants like this. That style of waiting tables is not only outdated but incredibly taxing for both the server and the guests. It is completely unnecessary and makes the server look like they are putting on a show as opposed to simply facilitating a pleasant meal.

Presentation: The food looked beautiful. I was thrown by my salad though. It was presented on a large plate inside of a clear cylinder. The food runner pulled the cylinder up while distributing the different parts of the salad over my plate. Completely ridiculous and overly showy. Total waste of money (for said cylinder) and definite wast of time. But that is just one example from our whole meal.

Overall: For a restaurant that touts seasonal ingredients and meals that won't blow your diet, they are doing well by their food. The decor is not my favorite, but that's just a personal preference. I am, however, put off my the service style. I would return, but it would certainly have to be on a day that I was overly concerned about my food intake and wanting my server to be a huge part of my dining experience."}
{"text":"Great food !! our particular server?..not so much!   but overall food is good and reasonable price  would go back again.."}
{"text":"Came here for a nice dinner with my girlfriend. The staff was very polite on the phone while making our reservation. Our server was very nice and considerate to our needs and questions regarding the menu. The food and drinks were amazing! Had a jalapeño mango crush to drink with my dinner and it was to die for. Flatbread appetizer was also great! And of course if you're eating here you've gotta try their indulgences desserts! If you're looking to pay a little extra for fine dinning, great service, and quality food, this is your place!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all. My friend and I went to this restaurant for her birthday dinner. We had to ask for bread three different times before we received it and the sever charged us for it! I ordered my filet steak medium and it was over-cooked. The server was very slow and not up to par for a restaurant which charges the prices that this one does. Decor in this restaurant needs updating or at the very least a good cleaning."}
{"text":"Wow. I have a new very most favorite restaurant in Phoenix. And I have a lot of favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  We went to dinner on a Tuesday night for a friend's birthday and it was really wonderful. Yes they are pricey, but when I spend $50 for dinner and two drinks, this is what I expect. We started with roasted eggplant flatbread, which was so tasty and so light - a perfect complement to the great Pinot noir that was recommended by our adorable and very knowledgeable waiter. I had the swordfish ponzu special on a bed of basmati rice and bokchoy and it was a little too much food for me, which was unexpected since all their dishes are low calorie. If I hadn't drank two glasses of wine i would have stayed under 500 calories and was STUFFED. My friends had (friend one) lamb chops (she loved it) and (friend two) scallops (really loved it).  The birthday garnered my friend a free dessert, which was a shot glass sized little yumminess of a pecan pie type thingie.  Just enough for a dessert and didn't leave her feeling ill like a big piece of pie would have. I drank my dessert.  :-). I will be going back very soon. I was already addicted to True Food, which is also in the fashion mall on Camelback. The parking is free for two hours with validation so it is convenient, as well.  Now I have to decide which of these two amazingly good restaurants to pick. Decisions decisions!"}
{"text":"Given that it is a Darden restaurant (and our proclivities lean AWAY from chains), we tried Seasons 52- mostly because we had accumulated a bunch of gift cards, and we knew we didn't want to waste them at Red Lobster.

Wow were we surprised.  Beautiful, dark interior with nice mood lighting; MUCH bigger than we anticipated.  The place was packed on a Saturday night- there was a great big bar with lots of people hanging around.  The waitstaff was impeccable- the restaurant cares enough about their staff to give them business cards to hand out.  

The food was amazing. They change it seasonally, so don't expect your favorite dish every time you go.  All the food is under 475 calories. Seriously, no need to worry about \"what\" you are eating because it is good for you AND tastes amazing. Wine is cheap! Ours was only $36 for a great bottle of Malbec.  And they make these little personal deserts that are the perfect size- for $2.50.

Only negative? LOTS of snowbirds :) Not that they bothered us, but it wasn't  a young, hip crowd (unless you were by the bar)."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place.  The menu looks delicious, it promises to be healthy (nothing over 500 calories) and it looks beautiful.  I'll start with the positives.  The place is packed, (which is generally a good sign for me, that means the food will be turning over quickly), it has a lovely bar and a very nice piano player reminiscient of the Old Eddie V's heydays.  
Then you order.  I like the quail breasts, the salads are quite good.  The flat bread is only okay.  It's not the lack of butter or cream, it's the lack of passion for the food.  It's as if you had a culinary student who was cooking becuase it was his final exam, and you didn't let him do what he wanted to do.  Once I learned that it was owned by the same chain that owns Olive Garden, I understood."}
{"text":"I love the changing selection with the changing seasons! The atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing. The wine list is delightful and the food is top notch! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone young or old. Beautiful presentation starts off the experience when your food arrives. Then you get to savior the entree of your choice. Seasoning is appropriate to the entree to enhance but not overwhelm the taste of the dish.
Also have fun, tasty desserts to finish off a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"I enjoy the salmon and tons of fresh veggies. Very well prepared food, and you leave feeling light, not too heavy due to the healthier quality food content."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Amazing drinks and cocktails. They serve seafood and steak as well."}
{"text":"Great menu, drinks food appetizers, everything. Great variety, nice healthy options. They made a small mistake on my take out order, a simple modification that was made by the kitchen, and not caught by the host. She repeated my order back three times with the modification but didn't check my order before handing it over.  When I informed them I was back at work and couldn't come back they offered me a gift certificate. It was a small mistake no big deal and they treated it as if there was a bug in my food haha. I appreciated that. They are very polite and Proffesional. This is elite customer service."}
{"text":"Nice place, really nice.  Kind of old school, but I can dig.  I heard great things about this place.  Needless to say I really like their concept.  The menus are based on the Seasons.  I attended with the Winter Menu.

Overall, food was okay.  There wasn't any flavor wise that busted out and punched me in the face.  Very simple, but I enjoyed it regardless.  I ordered a burger and a side salad.  Our appetizers were mushroom stuffed crab and shrimp - very salty, but was good.  Can I say their plating is phenomenal.  I rather enjoyed looking at my food more than eating it!  

Service was another phenomenal experience.  They take your name from the beginning and the waitress will refer to you by you name from there on -- Thank you Jillian! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had the most pleasurable dining experience at Seasons 52 on Sunday, March 20, 2016! 

We started with the shrimp scampi appetizer. Delicious. My son ordered the crab cake appetizer. It didn't take long for my mother and me to steal a bite of the crab cake from his plate. (I live near the Maryland shore and know a tasty crab cake when I see one.) It was moist, flavorful, and loaded with crab, not filler like some restaurants try to get away with. 

For dinner, three of us ordered the filet mignon. I ordered my steak to be prepared medium, erring on the side of medium well. (I know. Some of you are probably cringing right now.) It was perfectly prepared, tastefully seasoned, and melted in my mouth. The other two guests ordered their steaks medium rare and were very pleased. My son ordered the lobster pappardelle and thoroughly enjoyed it. (Yes, I snagged a small bite of his lobster. Couldn't help it.) 

And now for dessert. Oh, this was my favorite part of the evening! I love the mini desserts at Seasons 52. I already knew the Mocha Macchiato would be out of this world. It was. My husband and mother each ordered the Belgian Chocolate S'More and were equally pleased with their desserts. Rich chocolate with more chocolate, topped with a chocolate-dipped graham cracker. Can life get any better? My son ordered the Key Lime Pie AND the Raspberry White Chocolate Cannoli (apparently in anticipation that I would try to sample some of his dessert, which I did). Pure deliciousness. 

The service? Andrea was personable and attentive, and she timed each course perfectly. Drinks, including iced tea and water, were continuously (but discreetly) checked and refilled appropriately. We could not have asked for better service. She treated us as though we were family. 

There are certain restaurants I always visit when I am in the Phoenix area. Seasons 52 is now on my list. The bonus? There's a Seasons 52 in my hometown that we will definitely patronize more often."}
{"text":"I really do love it here. Especially because they have live music most nights. Can't really go wrong with dishes with 52 calories in them either, can you? I mean, like ever? Definitely worth the trip. Was fun to share a lot of things with the man. Try at least one flatbread and their coconut salad is to die for!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with a gal pal.  We both ordered the salad with salmon.   I don't know the exact name of the dish since I don't see it on their online menu.   Presentation was very good.   The salmon came on the side of the salad plate with the greens being presented in sort of a glass enclosure that was removed once the dishes were served.  The dressing was light, not heavy and not too much nor overpowering as far as flavoring and amount.  The salmon was seasoned and cooked to perfection.   Not dry -- which I hate and makes me dislike fish.   Very moist and flavorful. Perfecto!  Alexandra was our server.   Very pleasant and efficient.   The dish makes for a light lunch as long as one isn't too hungry.   I must admit, I came away a bit hungry, and that could have been because there really wasn't any sort of starch to fill one's tummy.   I would return and try some of the other dishes.   Perhaps dinner or something else on the menu for lunch."}
{"text":"Another wonderful dinner at Season 52. Our entire family of five enjoyed 3 wonderful flatbreads, scrumptious dinners, and I think we knocked out every dessert shot on the menu. For us, the pepperoni flatbread, scallops dinner, and the key lime and s'mores desserts were the winners but everything was tasty."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!!!  No cork fee just bring your own bottle!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty damned good and I'm disappointed that I didn't try it sooner. I didn't understand the concept of fresh, healthy upscale eating so I was surprised that everything was so delicious while minimally impacting my ever-expanding waistline. It just goes to show you that in this world of poisonous, processed foods it is still possible to enjoy your food and be healthy so well done to these guys.

I started off with a beer in the bar and started with the Blackened Steak and Bleu Cheese flatbread. The bread was thin and crispy and topped with two of my favorite things. Really delicious.

For my main I had the grilled scallops with asparagus and tomato mushroom pearl pasta. The scallops were AMAZING and so tasty without being bathed in butter. My plate was served up so beautifully arrange with the asparagus spears arranged in a grid over the pasta, it was almost a shame to eat it...almost.

Healthy then went out the window when we went through more than one of their Mini-Indulgence desserts. I had the key lime but my favorite was the raspberry with chocolate chip cannoli. Still fewer calories than a slice of cheesecake.

The atmosphere is very nice, the service is great and like I said, you really can enjoy some delicious food with out so much butter, fat and additives.

A good solid choice for a nice dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"Lou was in an understatement AMAZING recommended all of our food and we were more then satisfied he really knows his job and how to please thanks for making our day more than expected we will definitely be back there when in the area thanks Lou !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the idea. Local food when possible, portion control, no butter on anything, and the food is actually pretty good. Their food changes with the Seasons so their menu is ever evolving. The few times I've been there I've had the Tiger Shrimp Pasta which was really good, the Scallops, which were also very good, and some kind of chicken dish that was average. I think what I enjoyed the most was the Flat Bread Appetizers, they were delicious. Be careful though, just because the meals are supposed to be healthy doesn't mean you can over indulge. I would rate this place higher, but they don't serve local wines which they really should. Arizona surprisingly has some wonderful wines. I also learned they were owned by the same company that owns Olive Garden, Outback, and Red Lobster. Automatic discount for that."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Get the lump crab shrimp mushroom things because it's amazing. The maple glazed chicken and the lamb are also good. The dessert is heavenly. It's kinda dark in there so just be warned that its hard to see. Also kinda pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times  over the past several years. Food and service has typically been outstanding. However, we visited seasons 52 on 2/19/18  and as usual the food was great but the service was simply atrocious. My wife had to walk up to the bar to get drinks refilled!! The server offered us desserts and the bill was delivered by another person and our server FORGOT to bring the dessert display. I can only hope this was an off night by a server who was poorly trained. This is not the Seasons 52 I am accustomed to."}
{"text":"Nice enough place,  and I liked the idea of healthier foods.   I just have to say that my group and I all felt that there was nothing in the way of seasoning or bringing out the flavor of the food.   The food looks great and is well presented, but is rather bland."}
{"text":"Parking on the Biltmore north lot is free with plenty of space otherwise, there is valet. They have a small patio area. It's a very intimate to classy setting inside.

They have a very good seasonal menu. Started off the appetizers of duck wing lollipops and lobster ravioli. The duck wing lollipops were a messy affair but well worth it. Gochujang sauce was kind of sweet. I had the entree off the seasonal menu, I believe, of a dry-aged filet mignon rare with greens and asparagus. I had their take on moscow mule which was nice but I should've went with a red wine pairing to go with the steak. Their wine selection is pretty decent. There was a nice assortment of desserts that the lovely waitress had offered but I declined as I don't eat sweets. 

Dinner was excellent. I would definitely recommend and would be returning."}
{"text":"This was very disappointing. The food was mediocre , had filet, should ha move been better, no flavor. My friend had meatloaf, same opinion mediocre! However out Waiter Tommy was Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Went for an event. Their appetizers were excellent and the filet was cooked perfectly. Our servers were very cheery and attentive. An excellent restaurant to enjoy a wonderful steak."}
{"text":"This was not our first visit to this location of Seasons 52. Typically love the quality of food and atmosphere. Unfortunately, after our experience here for Mother's Day, we will not be returning. (Our lunch here last year for Mother's Day was fantastic! ) Yesterday we had a 12:30pm reservation, but because they over-booked so heavily, we were not seated until 1:15. there were so many people standing in the front of the restaurant and in the foyer, it was impossible to get to the host or speak with an employee. The atmosphere was loud and chaotic. Once seated, you could tell the waiter was trying to rush us out. No one at our table could relax. No apology for the 45 minute wait. Love the food here, and will continue to visit the La Jolla location, but next year we will find a new place for Mother's Day."}
{"text":"Pricey, good service. I like a little more fine dining in my fine dining. This felt like an upgrade BJ's Fine Dining but the wine selection was descent and the food ok."}
{"text":"Seasonally inspired menu with a few consistent mains.  Their soups are to die for! And be sure not to miss the duck lollipops. Robin at the bar is awesome!  

Always guaranteed to have a great menu and a spectacular meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the pits.
Took 11 people for dinner in a private room.
The food was average- but the napkins would have tasted great if the food took any longer coming out of the kitchen.
Dreadful service was only part of the terrible meal. The room we were in had     ZERO atmosphere and lighting  was hard on the eyes. 
It took 4 phone calls to make a reservation.
No manager ever returned my calls.
Never will return to this  place."}
{"text":"I would eat dinner here every night if I could. On each of my last two trips to Phoenix I enjoyed a 475 calorie dinner that was tasty and filling. Some folks seem to think that a meal must be covered in \"Country Gravy\" in order to be filling and worth the price. I disagree. Just the right amount of high quality good tasting food - works for me!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere. Jason is a fantastic waiter with much knowledge about the food and drinks !

Looking forward to going back next season ."}
{"text":"The entire experience was nothing but TEN stars.  The menu was spot on for Arizona summers ... cool and lite. The food was excellent. The quinoa salad was superb. I can't wait to go back again and again trying something new off the menu each time."}
{"text":"I like the decor of this place.  Sort of looks like Crate and Barrel.  I stopped in for happy hour and it quickly turned to sad hour.  They don't actually have a happy hour.  \"But we do have live music\".  

The bar is nice enough, several \"older folks\" enjoying themselves.  They have a lot of wine here but nothing outstanding.    I could see they had infused drinks.  Nice!  Nice until the waiter said that it wouldn't be ready for two more days.  Great planning.  \"What's on tap?\"  \"There aren't any beers on tap.\"

It was right about then that the live music started.  Some cute girl standing behind the bar playing and singing.  Poor thing - you could barely see her through the bottles.   Nice older crowd music.

Onto the food.  Every item less than 475 calories.  I suspect they are more than 475 calories but you will barely eat any of it - ta da - low in calories.   I had a lobster crab spring roll concoction with it's flavor totally replaced by bland.  The rest of the dishes where marginally better."}
{"text":"Thank you, Seasons 52, for having me in for a special preview lunch last weekend... it was such a treat!

I'd been to the Seasons 52 in Atlanta and had a great experience, so when I heard the news that they were opening a Biltmore location, I was really excited!  During my recent visit, I took a tour of the gorgeous new restaurant, which reminds me a lot of their Atlanta location.  It offers private dining rooms and even a room with A/V for business meetings... I also met some of the key partners of this Darden concept.  I actually sat next to Stephen Judge, their President, and learned a ton about the (100 wine selections / 65 available by the glass) on the menu from George Miliotes, Master Sommelier.  

My favorite wine, from the eight I sampled, was the Aveleda Vinho Verde, Portugal 2009.  And as for the food, I didn't have anything I didn't like... it was all pretty spectacular.  Standouts were the Organic Green Salad with Oak-Grilled Mushrooms, Toasted Pistachios and Truffle Dressing (which I must mention arrives with a very unique presentation), and the Sonoma Goat Cheese Ravioli.  I'm not a huge lamb fan, but theirs was perfectly paired with mashed sweet potatoes... mmmm!

As for dessert, Seasons 52 supposedly originated the \"mini indulgence,\" which is a small portion (shot glass size) of \"the real thing,\" dessert... in all of its decadence!  I sampled the Old Fashioned Carrot Cake and the fresh fruit, which were both delicious!  The other ones looked amazing too, but I couldn't justify eating anymore in one sitting.  I did see the custom \"Mini Indulgence Cake,\" which features 18 of these mini desserts; perfect for a celebration!

As Sarah S mentioned in her review, everything on the menu at Seasons 52 is under 475 calories, so you can dine guilt free...

**Fun fact: You can find out which \"Mini Indulgence\" matches your personality on their facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/seasons52?v=app_125847674120672
(I was fresh fruit the first time and key lime pie the second time!)

****Seasons 52 will be open to the public on 10/25, and I look forward to returning again real soon!"}
{"text":"Restaurant Week strikes again. 
Started with the chicken pesto flatbread. Came lighting fast, was super flavorful and very light all at the same time. 
Second course was the spinach salad. The strawberries were extremely fresh and I enjoyed the balsamic that it was dressed in. My only critique is that the blue cheese was very strong, it overpowered the salad for sure. 
Entree was the filet. It was perfectly cooked just lacking a little flavor. I've definitely had better. Wasn't bad just wasn't the best I've ever had. My mom got the short ribs which were delicious. She asked for extra grits and that put it over the top, so rich and creamy. 
Finished off with the two mini indulgences; the peanut butter one and mocha. Both to die for. They're perfect size but for a girl like me (huge sweets fan) leaves you wanting more. 
Very clean and great atmosphere. Our waitress was Jasmine and she was amazing. Definitely ask for her. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but today we had a lousy waiter and a rubber band in my soup. Sorry, it's  hard to recommend any place that's a choking hazard anymore. Pathetic and sad dining experience."}
{"text":"Great food, ambiance and service. Get the mushroom bisque and Brussels sprouts for sure!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants and my family's too. And trying to please four women isn't easy (one is super picky but I'm not naming names)!
Of course I love the healthy food. But what sets this place apart from other healthy food restaurants is this is fine dining. The décor, service and presentation is so much better than the granola feel you get at other places. 
The service has always been excellent and the wait staff go out of their way to get everything right. Last time we had Matthew as our waiter and I don't think he could have more perfect. Charming, knowledgeable, attentive and funny - he made our dining experience extrodinary. 
And it's great to feel free to order without worrying about calories. Because everything on the menu is less than 475 calories. And the menu changes constantly so I never get bored or in a food rut by ordering the same thing.  We started with a Roasted Roma Tomato with melted fresh mozzarella cheese, parmesan, and just enough basil. That was gobbled up pretty fast. We also had the Hummus Duo with Lavosh. I've been under impressed with many places that smother their hummus in garlic (hmm... Pita Jungle) or watered down. This hummus was fresh and not overwhelmed with anything that was added. 
I always have their Vegetarian Tasting. Which has 5 different items. Again - under 475 calories but it tastes like a lot more. My sister got the cedar plank roasted salmon and loved it. 
I've never had dessert because I always stuffed by the time I'm done with lunch or dinner. 
The prices are very reasonable for the type of food, presentation and service. If you want a great date restaurant without blowing the diet or the budget, Seasons 52 is the place."}
{"text":"Just realized I never did a review for our wedding reception. So to begin, it was in the spring. 

I have to say everything was wonderful, the wine was flowing, the mixed drinks were mixing, the appetizers (flatbreads), meals (salmon, filet mignon, and chicken) and desserts (chocolate peanut butter mousse, key lime pie, pecan pie, cheesecake, rocky road and fruit mini indulgences) were top notch! 

We wanted to have everything in central Phoenix (wedding at Desert Botanical Garden, dinner reception somewhere in midtown, hotels in Biltmore area for out-of-towners) and since the plan was to put it all together in 3 weeks, I was looking for simplicity.  I set up an appointment to meet with Adrienne, the sales manager, and was so impressed I signed the contract on the spot. She was totally on the ball and it felt as though she was in tune with my vision from the moment we started talking! 

They have private dining rooms for events and the atmosphere was absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"I went to Season 52 last night for dinner. The food was amazing! I ordered the flat breads to start and they were great. The were crispy and topped with fresh tasty ingredients steak, onion, mushrooms and blue cheese. My next was spinach salad that was also great. My entree was filet and was cooked to perfection. But most outstanding about our trip was our server Emily H. She was great always there when we needed her and very personable. She is a great asset to your restaurant! She really made it her business for us to have a memorable evening."}
{"text":"All menu items are fresh and most are local. All items are under 500 calories and taste delicious. The portions are perfect and the price is just right. The ambience is very posh and casual all in the same place."}
{"text":"Two week update: No response from managing partner to letter. Disappointing.


Short version: Poor manager customer service this time. Confusing menu offer for restaurant week. Generally it is an excellent restaurant.

Long version: This is a letter sent to the managing partner - easiest to CC here and will update as applicable.


I wanted to, as briefly as possible, share our dining experience last night. I visit Seasons 52 about ten times a year for pleasure and business, and last night was a special occasion for my family. We didn't realize that it was also restaurant week.

As always, the food was exceptional, and the few service errors could be overlooked - it took about ten minutes before we were greeted at the table and the salads were brought out and shoved in front of us midway through the first course (not by our waiter, but by two female runners). If this had been the experience I would not be writing you now.

However, this wasn't the case. My wife and son ordered from the restaurant week menu, and my daughter and I from the regular menu. Our waiter, Michael H, was kind enough to point out that my daughter should also order from the restaurant week menu as she wanted the filet, and he also noted that this meant that we would only be getting two flatbread first courses. When my wife questioned this he responded that this was noted on the menu. She responded that this was incorrect - the menu says 'Select one of the following to share'. Michael looked at the menu, was confused and agreed with our interpretation, and then sought a manager. Truthfully I would have been fine with the misunderstanding - it had already created more stress and confusion than was warranted.

Danielle Gonzales came to the table and noted that she understood that 'we had a problem with the menu'. This isn't customer service - it is problem escalation. She proceeded to berate me and explain in detail how the system wouldn't allow the order, that she'd have to charge extra and so on. I was glad when she left, but seething at this point being made to feel like some kind of cheapskate and fraud, worsened by the fact that I was being put into the position that I was somehow wrong (leaving it at misunderstanding would have been détente). I almost cancelled the order right then, but simply sat frustrated.

When Michael returned to the table I probably vented to him more than I should have, but he had started the engagement with an apology. I told him that at least he was smart enough to do that, and that the situation was very upsetting. Ms Gonzales took an unfortunate situation, that shouldn't have existed in the first place, and made it worse on behalf of the restaurant. I didn't not take my frustration out on Michael and tipped him my customary 20%+, although there were points where I seriously debated this.

In summary, I believe Ms Gonzales should have acknowledged that 'Select one of the following to share' does not imply or convey the intended concept of 'Every other order on this menu receives this item'. It took three minutes for me to get this, and dining should not be an intellectual activity. I honestly cannot fathom that the restaurant's P&L is improved by the high-margin appetizer being marginalized in such a bizarre manner - the wholesale amount is less than $3 and the goodwill eroded is worth thousands. 

Regardless of my experience, I would find it much more reasonable to reduce the portion size or provide a more precise explanation of how the menu is intended. As written it implies that the item is large and typically shared, especially when more than one is ordered. And, I am grateful this wasn't a business meal - it was awkward enough with family.

This isn't about the food portion (we never finish everything anyways). It is about service, which is what I expect from Seasons."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND 

A friend of mine was in town and asked me to find a central meeting place for dinner. I got online to see what was good around the Biltmore area and found Seasons 52. 

Seasons 52 has a pretty user friendly website and it was easier to just type in reservations than to call directly. 

As it got closer to the reservation time, I called just to make sure they received the reservation and that everything was set. The phone was answered on the first ring and the woman quickly and very politely confirmed everything was in order.

I arrived early and the hostess said it was fine to wait at the bar. 

After I sat down, I realized how gorgeous the bar was and in fact, the restaurant was huge and very well appointed. (see pics)

SERVICE EXPERIENCE 

The bartender introduced himself (Aaron) and was extremely friendly and efficient. 

When my friend arrived, we decided to just stay at the bar for dinner.

{"text":"This restaurant was very good, stopped in for a quick bite in Phoenix before a concert and had GREAT chili and a delicious salad.  I would eat there again and order the same thing."}
{"text":"I've been avoiding Seasons 52 for a while because I feel as though most chain restaurants compromise their quality for standardization. I did not feel this way at all and my only regret is that I didn't come here sooner.
 
Happy hour is from Monday through Friday between 4-6:30pm. They offer $5 small plates, $8/6 specialty cocktails, $6 wines and $4 beers. Ives tried their shrimp scampi, lamb lollipops, duck wing, tuna tartare, sea scallops, and meatballs. All of them were very good but the tuna tartare and the lamb stood out the most.

The garlic chicken pesto flatbread was also exceptional and easily the best thing we ordered. I also tried the crab cake and that was fantastic/worth ordering. The desserts are all $3 and delightful. Do not pass up on that (get the cherry creme brûlée).

Most notable was the service. Trey was our waiter and he was easily one of the top 5 servers I've had in my dining experience. He was courteous, attentive, friendly, patient, and professional. While the food was already great, it was Treys professionalism that made the experience so positive and memorable. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch for the first time at this attractive restaurant in the Biltmore Fashion Park with high expectations. The interiors are beautiful, inviting and classy and the menu looked interesting. The disinterested server did not make a good first impression. We ordered a couple of entree salads, one was good and the other was not good at all. The food was fresh but not well presented and the service was way below what it should have been for the price. We will not be returning to Seasons 52."}
{"text":"WOW.  I am impressed by the other ratings of this restaurant.  Maybe I just had a bad experience?  The extra star is for the sweet girl that served our table.  She wasn't spectacular but gets brownie points for kindness and effort.    

Originally, we were going to dine at Sting Ray (Biltmore Fashion Square) for sushi but I couldn't hold the 45 minute wait.  Seasons 52 was wide open for availability.  We decided on the bar/lounge since there was live entertainment.  Not even five minutes after being seated we decided the environment in the bar was just WEIRD and inevitably added to the bad experience.  The speakers need a serious fix.  My boyfriend described it best as sounding like someone was singing karaoke out of a kazoo.  Not to mention, the song selections were fit for a rehearsal at a hospice facility. 

I don't mean to sound snotty, but who the heck did they hire for interior decorating?  This place looked like someone got confused and designed a 1990's three-meal restaurant concept in a Vegas hotel/casino.  The booths were covered in a fabric that reminded me of a Bill Cosby modern ugly sweater and the bar stools were jungle fever zebra or something.  There is an exhibition kitchen in the main dining room which is always a nice touch to the atmosphere.  I think the best part of this restaurant is the view of the wine cellar in the bar.  And by the way, the wine list is claimed to be \"award winning\" but I was NOT impressed at all.  It is listed by varietal and price rather than being progressive by the taste profile.  

So, my fiance and I split a bottle of Gascon Malbec ($34 and sells for $12 at the grocery store) , the small spinach salad, asparagus side dish, and the lamb t-bone chops.  The food was tasty but something I could easily make at home.  The server recommended the lamb EVEN though I expressed I am not a lamb lover.  Well, I am still not a lamb lover.  I took one bite and passed the plate over to the mister.   My only complaint on the service is that she did not ask me if I enjoyed it or wished to order something else.  

Anyway, we spent $100 and I left hungry.  Needless to say, I won't be going back unless someone drags me here. And I could only imagine it would be my grandmother if she were still alive."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes...  This place rocks!  The server is cute, attentive, and awesome.  Modern decor, happening atmosphere, and great open space for large groups.  I was only doing the galentine day's with two awesome friends.  Greeted quickly and seated quickly for my reservation on Vday.  Ordered:

1.  ASIAN-GLAZED GRILLED CHICKEN SKEWERS - YUM!  great sweet/sticky glaze
2.  WOOD-GRILLED PORK TENDERLOIN:  sweet potato mash, sauté of bacon, French green beans and Brussels sprout leaves, zesty jus  - I have to say, it was very good and I almost ate everything off the plate.
3.  I got the chocolate graham cracker with chocolate mouse - My mouth has explosions of chocolatiness dancing.  SOOO  good!"}
{"text":"I had a date night with my husband and the food was fantastic! Also the atmosphere was very cozy and the selection of wine was great. 
We really enjoyed ourselves and I know we will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"This place was great!  Service was awesome and their healthy options on the menu were very helpful"}
{"text":"Place was nice, waiters are nice, food was good but forgettable. Experience was good but do not know if I'd go back. I've had much better dining else where."}
{"text":"Yes, everyone loves this place...right? Well, I liked it and will be back. In a community where Seasons seems well embraced, I think I'll leave my only know. The service was a bit below genuine \"good service\" standard. In a town loaded with top chef's and foodies to follow, I like the places where the staff shows genuine passion for the product they serve. These folks seem to have a job and do it as told. Maybe Season's needs to offer their team more to get excited about."}
{"text":"Came here after my sisters graduation and was pretty disappointed with the food and service .

My husband ordered the burger and the server asked my husband what kind of cheese and when the burger came out ...No cheese !!!! And the burger was not even good .. Super duper dry.

I had the lobster pappardelle and it was not that tasty at all . Bland and just nothing special 

Dessert ... Presentation was great ! But super sweet !


I had came here 4 years ago and so sad to find that the quality of food changed drastically . 

Not even good !!!!! So sad !"}
{"text":"This was probably my most favorite birthday destination, until this year. Service was ok, there was a bit of a wait to get in, which I'm not sure why since the place was far from packed. 

We ordered the lobster flatbread, which has always been a favorite, it was good and probably the best thing aside from dessert. 

We also ordered the lettuce lobster wraps with bacon which were ok. The filling was good, the real issue was that the lettuce was quite wet. I have to say one of the keys of executing a flawless lettuce wrap is getting the lettuce dry. The soups on the side were good, but we found them a bit salty and neither were hot. My asparagus soup was colder than room temperature, I'm not sure if that was intentional - I'm going to say no since it wasn't advertised as a cold soup. The potato soup was also fairly cool, albeit a bit warmer than the asparagus soup. 

Desserts were fun and delicious as usual, and drinks were good.

Another main part of my disappointment, on our visit was the billing. Although my waiter Steve remembered to do my coupon discount ($10 off) he charged us full price for all desserts after mentioning at the start he would have give me a special treat for my birthday. I know it is customary at Seasons52 to give dessert on the house for birthdays and previous years this was always honored. Unfortunately by he time I realized he put all the desserts through, my card had already been rung through. After waiting about 10 minutes for my receipt in the first place, I didn't really have time to bicker with him as we had an appointment after our visit. 

I think it may be time to find a new birthday spot!"}
{"text":"A  very nice find. Great menu with food to match. They boast that every meal is under 475 calories which usually means there is some sacrifice when it comes to flavor, not the case at Seasons 52. I had an Arugula salad and Ahi Tuna main course and the Rocky Road for dessert. The desserts are pretty darn neat I must say I wanted to try a couple of tem! Everything was very tasty and our waitress Natasha was on top of everything. Very refreshing. The atmosphere is very classy yet modern. You'll be very satisfied choosing Seasons 52."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant was great. When you first walk in the lighting is dim and intimate. Great for romantic dates. What I thought that was really cool are their menus it changes constantly which I thought was really cool. I got the lobster pasta I mean it was good but it had way too many vegetables in the dish. My date had the filet mug on prepared well done with mash potatoes and boy was it good. I would suggest not getting a pasta but something with meat definitely. I wanted to eat my dates and not mine. Although I did enjoy my food. I had a drink as well it was a berry cocktail and I mean not that I'm complaining by the alcohol to juice ratio was astounding. My drink was very strong hard for me to enjoy it. Lastly we had their dessert we got two shooters they gave us one for free because it was a special day for us. I got the one with chocolate EVERYTHING as I am a chocolate lover my date got the one with PEANUTS and chocolate stacked. I didn't try my dates but mine was amazing. If you're looking to take someone special out for dinner seasons 52 is it make a reservation just in case as the hostess did recommend I do that when I called in."}
{"text":"Decided to go here during restaurant week. It was fantastic. I had the filet mignon. Perfectly cooked to a medium. My buddy had the paella which was quite good. Not traditionally made with lots of rice but still very tasty. They did not skimp on the seafood. This place can get pricey but would be excellent for special occasions."}
{"text":"Officially my favorite place to dine in Phoenix and I'm a foodie from Chicago.
Very welcoming ! Their menu items are diverse and below 500 calorie ceiling for the most part SO delicious too! Steak and seafood fresh! Tom was my server the sweetest and most informative server ever. 
Been here a week researching places too dine for clients so happy I finally found a place reputable and amazing! That I will feel confident sending VIP's"}
{"text":"Had the trout and it was delicious!  Caesar salad was good too.  Desert in the small cup didn't taste too fresh (probably sitting in the cup too long).  Enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"5 star for a nice meal that is also healthy

Positives:
This place is wonderful all around. Amazing service, atmosphere and food is phenomenal. We were very pleased to see how low calorie or food was for such a nice meal. We will be back! 

We recently went to their Yelp event and loved the fall menu as well!!

Negatives:
None."}
{"text":"Another example of a fine Darden restaurant. Darden, the people responsible for keeping servers' wages stagnant at $2.13 an hr. Bland food and inflated prices make this a spot to skip over.  The server was fine, she hit all the robotic beats that Darden drills into their servers heads, and was a steady barrage of up-sells. Darden, the used car lot of restaurants.  If you're reading this, and wondering why someone who hates Darden restaurants ate at one, well, I had a gift card from a misguided friend.  I would not recommend any Darden restaurant to anyone...ever, unless I really hated them."}
{"text":"This restaurant was awesome! The service was above and beyond and everything we tried was delicious! Plus, only 475 calories or less per serving...I'll take it! Sure didn't taste \"light\" by any means! Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant in the heart of the Arizona Biltmore area.  It has an incredible 3 course menu for just under $30 with a variety of offerings from seared tuna to filet mignon. The food was all very tasty and incredibly reasonable. However the server was lacking. He tried really hard to be personable and engaging but misfired as he encroached into my personal space and was not readily available.  He was also training another server and this did make the process cumbersome. 
I would have easily given the experience 4/5 stars but due to the service had to down grade to a 3. 
The bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"The food and service was great. I recommend the salmon salad. It was cooked to perfection with lots of flavor and glaze. The service was professional and surprisingly fast for a high quality restaurant"}
{"text":"The food was great we ordered several things and all traded meals around. Everything I tried was delicious. We had the shrimp and grits, tomato mozzarella salad, lobster pasta, vegetarian sampler, caramelized Brussels sprouts, a crab cake, and my absolute favorite thing was the buffalo bean chili! Great evening out with adults. My 18-20 year old kids weren't very impressed."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good.  We ordered a lavish dinner via currier.  We were not disappointed.  I was hesitant at the $11 lobster tail...just because of the price and this being...well...not near an ocean.  It was actually very good. Delicious carrot cake."}
{"text":"Seasons 52 is one of the restaurants that I never feel like I need to go back to after dining there. It's not great, nor horrible. Just ok.I've dined here a few times before, but is usually forgotten the next day. One of the perks is that they offer private dining rooms and a projector. 

I came due to a private event. I tried the mimosa and a cocktail and both were ok. The flatbreads and chicken skewers that was ordered was meh too. I wasn't impressed at all. 

The service was great through and our servers were really attentive. Other than that, I don't plan to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"SCOTTSDALE: Seasons 52 is a terrific chain with healthy items and local fare.  It mostly packs a lot of flavor within those right restrictions.

The ambience is modern, geometric and a little on the formal side.  It was perfect for a lunch with business associates.

FOOD

Caramelized Scallops (5 stars): These were a very generous serving of scallops; they have quite a few.  Well prepared and served atop asparagus and risotto. 

Lobster Flatbread (4 stars): Flatbread is more like a cracker than a \"bread\" and the taste is good, but toppings are a little less plentiful than you might hope.

Fish Tacos (3 stars): These were good, but a little dry and could use more flavor.

The burger looked a little on the weak side as well, but I didn't try it."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. Cedar plank salmon and filet mignon both delicious. Great wine selection and flights. Seasonal, fresh, real food. Run of the mill atmosphere, but overall lovely dining experience."}
{"text":"We were staying nearby and decided to stop-in for a light dinner at Season 52 in Phoenix. We like good wine, small plate meals and tasty food - so, it is a natural for us. This particular Season 52 visit was made even better ... as our server was \"Tommy\"; he was fantastic. This gentleman is a true professional that was both knowledgeable and extremely helpful .... Additionally, these attributes were complimented by a great, witty sense of humor. I recommend you ask for him!

We started with wine, the Lake Sonoma, Alexander Cab for me and a Cakebread Chardonnay for my lady. I also ordered a sparkling water. The first glasses of wine were enjoyed with the Ahi Tuna Tartare which was spiced up with just the right amount of wasabi-avocado mousse and some king of tropical tasting salsa.

Then we shared an order of Sea Bass as well as a plate of Sea Scallops. The Chilean Sea Bass was served on top of black rice backed up by snow peas and shitake mushrooms. Really, really good - nice texture, moist yet pleasingly flaky and a subtle, rich flavor. Our Sea Scallops were grilled and caramelized. They were presented with butternut squash risotto and broccoli. The lemon butter made it even better.

We ended the culinary experience with coffee. I order a triple espresso (I needed to stay awake) and my partner had a regular coffee. We find Season 52 consistently satisfying."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous meal at reasonable price.  Great atmosphere.    Our server Chris was awesome."}
{"text":"Great service! Mathew was our server and had the patience to go over the menu with us. The food in general was fresh and very tasty."}
{"text":"We had a scrumptious dinner there with some friends.  The wait staff was friendly, attentive and informative."}
{"text":"We went for dinner this past Wednesday, and I had a few takeaways from the experience. Amazing service, wine selection is varied and diverse, and the seasonal menu is stellar. If I had a second stomach, I would have ordered the whole menu- that being said, we ordered the flatbreads, filet mignon, butternut squash soup, boneless beef short rib, and a whole bunch of desert shots. 

Would definitely recommend a reservation, there hasn't been a time that I've been to this establishment and they haven't been busy. Do not come here expecting to take home leftovers- the serving sizes are not proportional to the pricing, but it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"The place and service was wonderful.  Karen our server was exceptional but the flatbread was flat. Too well done and hardly anything on it, quite disappointing."}
{"text":"So I finally got to Seasons.  It's weird, I was waiting for it to open because I loved the concept, then I wait this long.  I can't explain why.  Anyway, I made reservations for early, like elderly early, on a weekend night due to my dining companion's plans.  So we got there, the place was probably about half full, and they go to seat us at a table in the dead center of the room.  WTF?  We asked to be moved to one of the 3 open booths we saw in the dining area, and were told that they couldn't move us because they were \"reserved\".  Annoying, but we moved into a booth at the bar.  The decor was kind of dark generic chain steakhouse style, and there was a piano with a piano player in the bar.  This or the 6pm seating time may explain why it was full of olds.  I mean, nobody but us under 45.  

The server came very promptly to talk to us, and immediately I sensed some sort of nervousness or maybe just weirdness, because he seemed discombobulated and giggled a lot.  It took prodding several times for him to take our order, because he had a penchant for walking up to the table, inserting himself in our conversation, and then forgetting that he was our waiter and that he's there for a reason.  But he was nice enough for the casual type of place it is- definitely not fine dining.

The concept of this place is really cool- I like to eat healthy, seasonally, and knowing the calorie counts of my food is pretty important to me.  This is why I'd go back if I felt like a dinner out but not accidental consumption of 2000 calories because the restaurant injects their food with butter.  The food I had was so-so.  We started out with the tomato basil flatbread because we were told it was a specialty.  It was meh.  It gets a pass for being under 475 calories, but if I'd ordered it at a full-cal restaurant, I would have been disappointed by its blandness.  I also ordered the vegetable plate, which I did like.  I think it changes seasonally, but it had a mini corn on the cob, some baby carrots, a couple of broccoli florets, some turnips (may have been parsnips), some quinoa, a couple of baked tomatoes, and a small piece of glazed tofu.  What surprised me about this was the lack of flavor.  I cook low-cal all the time but it has flavor.  This was literally like a bare steamed broccoli floret, bare steamed carrots, etc. BUT when I got home and looked online, the sodium was off the charts.  I don't know how that happens.

Again, I'll go back but only because I'm always on the lookout for healthy, calorie conscious food.  Definitely not a \"destination\" for me."}
{"text":"Loved it! Bar area is my area, other areas reminds me of \"fine dinning' so fancy. :) . Best seat in the house if you ask me is at the bar. Their wine selection is huge! Beautiful restaurant. Pretty official place, got greeting and sat right away. Came for lunch around noon, bartender guy was nice and welcoming. I'll be back. Only damper part, was I discreetly wanted to take care of the bill which I explained to the bartender before hand and asked him not to mention it on his return at the end. And he says \"here is the remaining bill after the deduction.... like uggggggg what did I ask you to do. Only eye roll moment I had. But I'll go back maybe that was an accident. There was maybe four others at the bar so it wasn't busy during the time I was there..."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went for his birthday. He had the Veal porterhouse and loved it. I had the Citron chicken. I loved mine. Once again, everything was just perfect. Service great, food fabulous and the pecan pie dessert, heavenly!! 

Really, you  have to try this place."}
{"text":"Food is delicious AND healthy. Also, the bartender made great drinks and was super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, always good food and professional service. Had the rainbow trout, really delish. Started with the flatbread, slightly dry but tasty, and low in calories , so makes for guilt free dining. Nice wine selection and inviting decor , goid place for fine dining experience without the high price tag."}
{"text":"pretty good spot, checked in and got a free flat bread which was really good.  Seasonal entrees and a very friendly staff.  everything on the menu is healthy but also actually very good as well.  Left full - desserts were great as well."}
{"text":"We reserved a private room for a 50th wedding anniversary. From start to finish the process and service were amazing. The menu was awesome, food was awesome, service was awesome. Our guests had an amazing time. Our server, Sally, was amazing. She was attentive and knowledgeable. Everything was handled smoothly and professionally. Sally made sure everyone had whatever they needed. I can not praise her enough. 

From the get go Adrienne made everything as easy as possible. From selecting the menu to the wines it was smooth sailing. My hat goes off to the entire staff of Seasons 52. If we need to do another event this will be on my top 10 list. 

Thank you again to Adrienne, Sally and Trey for making this a memorable evening for our family."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went for some wine and dessert! We sat at the wine bar and it happened to be live piano bar night. Such a fun time! Great wine, delicious little desserts! Food looked to be very small portions for a high price, that's not my kind of place but we did have fun at the wine bar!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here for so long but the service we received wasnt up to standards.  The way they serve the salad is pretty unique but the salmon needed more flavor. I have definitely had better!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant experience ever. Our waiter as was great, friendly and personable. I wish I could remember her name. Other restaurants should take training and advice from this place. Food was excellent!! I love that the menu changes every season. I can't wait to go back for spring!! I will definitely recommend this to friends."}
{"text":"Very comfortable Biltmore spot. Great place to grab a drink or small plates to share or alone. The food is good. Happy Hour has half price deals. Patio seating is nice as its at the end of the mall area so not too crowded. It's also nice enough of date night. The staff is very friendly and they know the menu. Bartenders are top notch. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Seasons 52 a few times and just went recently for our anniversary.  We had an amazing experience!  The food was wonderful; all very tasty and cooked to perfection.  I can't even pick the part of the meal that was my favorite.  Our server, Ryan, was great too.  He helped make it a very enjoyable experience.  Overall we were very pleased and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! I was able to enjoy a sneak peek and loved every second of it. The menu was sensational and the wines were to die for. 
I especially enjoyed the staff! They were extremely knowledgeable and friendly. Our server was so sweet and charming. 
I will definitely be back when it opens (tonight!) regularly!"}
{"text":"First time here !! Definitely won't be our last!!! Everything was soooo good from the decor to the delicious food to out  AMAZING server Tommy!! I had the Seabass and my my husband had a blue rare streak!! Both cooked to perfection!! Soo happy we came here! It's been a hot minute since we've had this great of a time/service  and meal!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing! Very friendly staff and free valet parking. Flat bread was delicious and loved the duck lollipops! The scallops tasted like nothing but char and the risotto had crunchy pieces of rice. The waitress did not make us pay for it which was greatly appreciated!"}
{"text":"First time here and was very upset with my experience.  We had reservations for Mother's Day @ 1 pm.  We were not seated until after 1:30 pm.  I ordered the prosciutto and brie flatbread, stuffed mushrooms, potato and leek soup and kids hamburger.  The stuffed mushrooms were terrible.  I had mentioned that I did not care for them to my server and they did not seem to care.  Did not offer to replace them with something else or take them off the bill, just said \"Oh sorry about that\".  The soup was OK.  And then I was brought something that looked like a prosciutto salad.  I let the food runner know that was not what I ordered.  While everyone else ate there lunch I got to sit and wait for mine.  When I finally received my flatbread, it was not good.  Very dry and the flavors did not go together at all.  My son's hamburger, which I ordered medium well, was closer to a medium rare.  Thank goodness he didn't eat the more rare part to avoid possible food borne illness.  While a steak is OK med rare, ground beef is NOT.  Needless to say he did not eat the burger.  I would have said something to the server again but, they seemed so disinterested in accommodating us, I didn't want to frustrate myself even more.  Also, they almost never refilled my water.  At one point I almost got up to go get the pitcher myself.  We finished the meal with some small desserts, I had the strawberry rhubarb cheesecake (Which I will say was pretty tasty) and my son had the Smores dessert.  Other members of my party also expressed their dissatisfaction with their meals (overcooked halibut, poorly seasoned dishes etc).  After grudgingly paying a $56 bill, I left the restaurant still hungry.  A few hours later, my son started complaining that his stomach hurt.  I encouraged him to drink some water and maybe eat some crackers but he didn't want to eat or drink anything.  Then, at around midnight, my son woke up PROJECTILE VOMITING all over the bed!!!!!  I knew it had to have been something he ate there.  Wonder if it was the under-cooked meat or perhaps the dessert?  This restaurant should be ashamed of itself."}
{"text":"Ambience is nice, too noisy, we had to pretty much yell to be heard, waitress uninformed on menu items, was there alcohol in my mimosa, take the very small  frittata out of the cast iron baker, frittata was made with a watered down mixture that i could not personalize, awful. Half cooked asparagus, long wait for food, too much on menu for them to do a good job, too many hostesses up front no one new what they were doing, two other meals at my table served in bowls, trying to be an upscale restaurant--didnt make the grade, won't be apt to return."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place. I come often with friends, as well when my company has events in the area, and they bring us here. This time we had a company event for over 30 people. 

Service as usual was great and we were very well taken care of. The menu was set so we didn't have many options but that is totally fine with me. The appetizers were the signature flat bread (garlic pesto chicken, and the roster Roma tomato), both were great and tasty, the Roma tomatoes flatbread was my favorite. 

I got the Cesar salad, then I ordered the half chicken with root veggies, and mashed potatoes, and  everything was delicious. The chicken was juicy, though boned, it was easy to cut through with the knife. 

Finally the dessert, which I love, I was able to snag 2 desserts / or was it three :-) I had the pumpkin pie, the double German chocolate and the mocha one and they are all great, small portions that do not make you feel guilty :-) definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"OMG this place was amazing! My fiance and I made last minute reservations here for valentine's day. We were able to note online that it was our first time here. I thought since i made the reservations online last minute that we would still have to wait but we were seated right away as our table had already been marked reserved. Our waiter was very nice and super attentive. We were given a free pink champagne toast and they really set the mood with lit candles at our table and just had the perfect ambiance! The food was perfectly cooked and absolutely amazing. We had the lobster flat bread as an appetizer and the filet mignon as our entree. Everything was to die for! When asked about dessert I had said I looked at the menu ahead of time and was really looking forward to the pecan pie or raspberry canoli dessert but I just had too much food and I couldn't possibly order dessert so we got the check. Our server brought us the check and surprised us with the two little dessert shot glasses I was wanting on the house! Thank you so much to our waiter (really wish I remembered his name) and Seasons 52 for making our Valentine's dinner extra special! We have a new born baby and don't get to get out much anymore so this was exactly what we needed. Bravo for going above and beyond! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Our server this past weekend was very good- I wish I remembered her name!  My husband and I and my in-laws all ate here and tried a few appetizers like the duck lollipop wings (a bit spicy for my taste but still great,) and a chicken pesto pizza which was also good.  My main course and my brother-in-laws main course was the scallops which honestly I have had better.  The scallops just were not flavorful and I have had better risotto.  The peas and asparagus were okay but those are hard to mess up.  My sister-in-law had the salmon which looked pretty great and she seemed to like it.  At the end of your meal you can choose tiny desserts like an amaretto one or smores or chocolate peanut butter.  I love tiny dessert cups because you can have that sweetness without feeling too sugar-high afterwards.  I would eat here again!"}
{"text":"I was so pleased with my first experience at Seasons 52 (Sacramento), I wrote the company and made it a point to visit the Biltmore location when I returned home.  Each of 3 visits there have been less than the previous; so much so, I won't return.

The staff is waaaay too consumed with entertaining themselves.  Eating at the bar, I was ignored repeatedly.  But what really pissed me off was, over the holidays, I visited for dinner, and I ordered two steak and mushroom soups to go.  When I got home, what they had given me was completely different, wrong.

I returned the next day at 11:01am.  I didn't want to go during the lunch rush but since I was early, I had to wait for the manager in a staff meeting (apparently he does not have staff), he came out 22 minutes after I had arrived, NO APOLOGY WHATSOEVER, not for the messed-up order, not for having me wait, nothing.   Wait.  Isn't this the \"SERVICE\" industry?  Why, yes.  Yes it is.  But just not here.

Then, instead of ASKING if I still wanted the soup, he simply stated, \"You want a refund, right?\", so I answered yes,  He gave me a refund and a business card for a $25 off next visit.

Fuck him. I'd rather have the $25 than his apology.  But get this: 45 days later, when I presented $25-off card with my check, the bartender, also my waiter, informed me that this was a seasonal promotion and wasn't valid any longer.

YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE OWN(ED) OLIVE GARDEN?  RED LOBSTER?  WHAT WOULD THEY KNOW ABOUT FINE DINING?  nothing.

NEVER AGAIN.  Not even for free.  for nothing else than he kept waiting a past customer with  a problem.  Clearly he was perfect for Darden Restaurants."}
{"text":"The Family and I went back here on Saturday night. 

The food is just as spectacular as it was the first time we went! 

The service however was just not good. Our waiter seemed dazed and confused the whole time we were there. And slllllow. He also forgot stuff, I ordered a second glass of wine mid dinner and it never came, and I was never given the option to remind him because he did not come back until it was time to clear the plates! We sat at our table, all of us with empty plates for a good 10-15 minutes with out anyone coming by to clear them. We just sat there. Not cool, and its not like he was in another section, there was a table he was at 3 separate times that was directly behind ours, he just chose to ignore ours. 

We will go back as we do like the food and atmosphere and hopefully the service will improve."}
{"text":"Probably the best 500 calorie salad I have ever had... The BBQ Chicken Salad is an illusion how they make this salad for only 440 calories is insane.. I will be eating this salad four times a week, My wifes Quail was so rich with the whipped sweet potatoes at only 375... RIDICULOUS! The food and service are 5 stars, but the atmosphere feels quite corporate and forced, The live piano Bar in the Lounge is kind of creepy.. Just my two cents.. But if you are looking to shed a few pounds.. Seasons 52 would have to be on you rotation list with True Food, Blue Burrito, China Lite, and The Chili at Wendy's:)"}
{"text":"Fun place,  upscale.  Was surprised it was in a mall.  Almost canceled,  but glad we stayed.  To be honest,  if yelp revealed it was in the Mall I would not have made reservations.  Was looking for an authentic phoenix restaurant as we were visiting on business, and not lookingfor a mall chain. Having said that,  I'm glad it worked out.  Food was tasty and trendy, so not for the stuffed shirt boss. But who wants to eat with him anyway. ..ha!"}
{"text":"Delish!  Drinks pineapple cosmo smooth and mojitos were so refreshing.  Service was excellent and you can hear each other.  Great desserts candidate wait to try hh next time!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and all low calories. We had the artichoke stuffed artichoke, goat cheese raviolis, scallops w/ pearl pasta, and penne shrimp pasta, it was all amazing!  The menu changes seasonally so you have to find new favorites but it's definitely delicious."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed to say my experience wasn't as great as the other reviewers. The manager quickly called me when I submitted the online evaluation, which was nice.
Table was dirty, guacamole on Tacos was brown & I had a white short hair on my raspberry lemonade.  Bill was $70 for 4 people during lunch (no desert or alcohol), which seemed expensive for what was ordered.
Positive: wait staff very nice & decor is pleasant.  Still give it a try since others had a better experience."}
{"text":"Season's 52, my absolute worst restaurant experience in years.

I began as a chef, but have also served as F&B director, consultant, and restaurant owner. I've been in the restaurant bizz since the 1980s and have worked with James Beard award recipients, cooked for 2 Presidents and have had many media accolades including \"M's entrees can go toe to toe with anyone's in the Valley\"-AZ Republic. I know what I'm talking about here, NOT my first rodeo.

Last week, Thursday evening, I dined at Season's 52 at the Arizona Biltmore with 5 others. I've never been to Season's 52, have always heard good things.

The restaurant was clean, immaculate really. After being seated, waiting 8 min., server approached the table to take the drink order, three of us without hesitation, asked for water, as it is Phoenix, it's summer, and 108° that day! Why no water upon seating? In my head I'm wondering at this point, what low-end casual restaurants serve water upon arrival? Denny's & IHop apparently have higher service standards for water service thus far. Am I being unrealistic? Should I expect water service? In 108° Phoenix heat, I think water should be on the table, or poured upon seating.

Our water arrived, we ordered a bottle of wine. Wine was presented properly, served professionally, excellent presentation, and was delicious. Nice job!

Now it was time to order entrees. It went smoothly, until the server got to me. I ordered the Humus to start, followed by the Short Rib. I asked that my starter be served with my Entree as I was the only one to order multiple courses. Server indicated that the Short Rib may not be available, so left me with the menu as she went to kitchen to inquire. Moments later returning, indicated the item was out, but I had already made a 2nd choice, Roasted Chicken. In my years as a chef, I've 86ed 2, yes 2 items that guests would have been alerted to. Same as Season's 52, I utilize paper menus, so if an item runs out, I print new menus without the item, so no guest knows or is misled. If it's on the menu, you should be able to order it. It's a simple concept, that I wish more restaurants would adopt. 

15 minutes later, the entrees began to arrive. All but one was served. 3 in my party ordered the same Entree, 2 ladys, 1 man. 1 lady, and the 1 man was served. What ever happened to lady's get served 1st? Apparently not at Season's 52. The server indicated that the kitchen made a mistake, and was making hers now.

Let's touch on this for a minute... 
Person that wasn't served now waits, feels guilty that others feel bad that the Entree hasn't arrived. All other people around table either (1) begin eating slowly, feeling guilty that their food arrived but someone's hasn't. OR (2) Wait for last Entree to arrive, watching their own food go cold, as the person waiting is served piping hot food.

Seriously, I don't know who the expiditor, food runner was, but anyone should be able to count to 6. Kids can count to 6 without taking their shoes off. If 6 Entrees are not in the window, don't serve the table, again, simple concept. Also, apparently not a priority at Season's 52.

When the Entree arrived, I believe it was in the managers hands. Who asked \"How is everything? Is there anything else I can get you?\" Jedi mind trick? Or lack of communication with your staff? Since the manager did present the final Entree, it was obvious the manager had better things to do than apologize to her guests. I thought, 'I'm not saying anything, you're already off to a grand start, I'm not going to pursue this.'

We all began to eat. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food, or didn't say anything to me.

My Humus was awful. It was a white bean puree (made days ago), not garbanzo beans. It was like eating thick flavorless paste. Does Season's 52 think white beans are garbanzo beans? Is it their own twist? Nothing on the menu indicated the humus itself, minus the garnish, was anything but what you would expect, garbonzo beans. I 'Truth In Menu' is a simple concept, that happens to be a law in some parts of California, you may wanna take note of that, Season's 52.

My chicken was great, but the \"Yukon Gold mashed potatoes\" weren't Yukon Golds, they were Russet Potatoes. Gotta ask at this point, is it Season's 52 intention to deceive guests? Once is a mistake, twice is intentional.

Dessert came, was great. Did not change my mind as to the blunders of my evening at Season's 52.

Before dining at Season's 52, dropping $20-$36 per Entree, keep in mind, you live in an excellent food town, with incredible restaurants, who serve great food, and want nothing more than to please you. In fact some of the best restaurants in Phoenix have always called 24th & Camelback home, steps away from my dismal dining experience at Season's 52.

Server was tipped 19% as she was not to blame, mostly. 

Management & Corporate should take more time training staff, front and back of house. 

1 Star, Participation Award."}
{"text":"Out of most of your standard chain restaurants, Seasons 52 is often considered to be one of the better choices based on what most people say. We've dined here twice, but only because I received one of those gift cards that covers the multiple restaurants that the Darden Corporation owns. And when you look the other options (Olive Garden, Yard House, etc), Seasons is probably your safest bet.

I appreciate the gimmick of the menu changing with the seasons - although this isn't something that's quite as unique as people claim. A portion of the menu, the chef's recommendations, apparently changes every week. The core menu, however, remains the same - which is good if you find something that you're a fan of. 

For some reason, the setup reminds me of a hotel bar/restaurant. Maybe because it's very dark and extremely heavy on wood. 

During our most recent visit, we ordered a meyer lemon and ricotta ravioli. It was decent, with a nice lemon-zest and peas that were very nice quality, aided by the addition of brown butter. We also ordered a crispy green tomato and burrata board. The burrata was standard stuff, while the green tomatoes weren't really our thing. The honeycomb was very good, but the serving size was the equivalent of one of my one-a-day vitamin pills. During our first visit, we ordered one of their flatbreads and weren't really all too impressed, so we stayed clear of those during our return.

I ordered the filet mignon, which is the same thing I ordered during our first visit. This comes with some lumpy mashed potatoes and so-so roasted asparagus. It was okay, but not quite on the level of what can be obtained at this price point if you know where to look. On the other hand, my girlfriend ordered the cedar plank roasted salmon and was mostly pleased with its flavor. The potatoes were fine and I was actually impressed with the yellow carrots taste.

At the end, they bring out all of the desserts on a plate and allow you to pick your poison before returning the unpicked items to the refridgerator. We opted for the Belgian chocolate s'more and mocha machhiato. These desserts are very light and cleverly layered. They're actually very good and I see it as a neat little concept. In fact, most of what you eat here is very light, due to their intentional efforts to keep calories below a certain threshold that we all know makes our stomach churn.

For a chain, Seasons 52 is by no means a bad choice. And while I'd much prefer obtaining this type of food from a respectable local steakhouse, I can see the appeal for many. And while nothing particularly \"wowed\" us, I still think it's worth trying out for yourself."}
{"text":"Love the concept. Each item on the menu (the entirety of the plate) is under 475 calories. New, healthy me, wanted to absolutely love this place. Reasonable me ended up liking it, but found it was too expensive for what you get.

We ordered chicken skewers as an appetizer, each had an entree and each got a dessert shooter. We wanted to try the full effect of Seasons 52.

I had the lamb t-bone entree with truffle mashed potatoes and asparagus. I liked the lamb, the potatoes were good, and the portions were surprisingly not tiny given how the dish is under 475 calories. My wife had a salmon dish which she liked, but didn't love. 

We finished off the meal with a dessert shooter, which is a fun concept, and was pretty tasty. Service throughout the meal was good and attentive, if not a tad over the top towards the end.

My issue with this place is the price. We ordered one soda (I had water), one appetizer, two entrees and the two mini desserts, and after tax and tip our bill was $85. I'm 100% OK with spending $85 on a great dinner, but the food was neither good enough nor filling enough to justify that price. The dessert shooters were only $2.50, so it's the entrees that kill you. 

I suppose if we'd avoided the appetizer and gotten slightly less expensive entrees (my lamb was $26 and my wife's fish was $23), it would have been more reasonable...Still, $85 gets two people a great meal at a lot of places, including an appetizer and dessert. Considering that we weren't drinking that night, the bill just seemed too high for what we got.

Again, I love the concept, and the food is pretty good, but I'm hard pressed  to spend that kind of money on food that's neither exceptional nor completely filling, in an atmosphere that doesn't warrant their price points. I could see trying this place for lunch, but I don't think I'll be back for dinner anytime soon."}
{"text":"Visited on New Year's Eve for dinner with the family.  Tried the flatbreads, steak, salmon, lamb chops, shrimp and the cesar salad for entrees.  I have never had shishito peppers nor buttersquash and both were prepared wonderfully to where I would try them again.  Nothing to complain about.  My mother in law is GF and they were accomodating to her needs.  Great flavors and fresh veggies cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Last night, we celebrated my husband's birthday at Seasons 52. Walking inside, the dining room is gorgeous with dark wood and glass-very stately looking. The bar is absolutely amazing and well stocked. The menu? Wonderful and the food, superb--which I'm giving a 5 star rating. My compliments to the chef and his staff. But here's what ruined a perfectly good evening--our server and her coordination with the kitchen.

Our reservation was for 6:45 on a Thursday evening. The restaurant had customers, but it wasn't as busy as you'd expect to see on a weekend. 

We ordered our starter and a salad that we spit between us. Two bites into our salad and the runner from the kitchen walks up to our table with our entrees. I had the scallops, my husband had the shrimp and grits. My reaction was \"you've got to be kidding.\" The runner said she'd take it back to the kitchen to keep warm. In the meantime, I'm thinking about these expensive entrees getting tough from sitting under the heat lamp, and I'm suddenly rushing to finish my salad. 

If it wasn't for the kitchen manager coming to our table shortly thereafter to apologize and tell us she'd make new entrees, this restaurant would be getting a single star. We appreciated her making an appearance, but here's what sullied her good intentions. We finished our salads and the runner is back. The dirty dishes still haven't been cleared off the table. I asked where she planned to put the entrees, and no, at this point, I was not going to clear the table for her. This is what I call an upscale restaurant. The runner obviously got frustrated until our server appeared and rushed to clear.

Now I ask you. Do I blame the restaurant for not training their wait staff properly, or the server for not being able to judge her timing? 

Will we go back and risk another mishap to ruin yet another evening? I don't think so. There are far too many excellent restaurants in the Scottsdale area that do have well-trained staff."}
{"text":"Seasons 52 never disappoints! This is one of my family's go-to restaurants for a solid (and healthy!) meal. I LOVE that they change their menu every week to make sure they're serving what is fresh and in season at the time (hence the 52 in their name). All of their dishes are less than 475 calories, which is great for people who are watching their calories or be more aware of what they eat.

We usually split a flatbread for the 5 of us - try the Chicken Pesto - and then get an entree for each person. Since the portions are smaller, it's easy to share dishes and try different orders. I love their honey and herb half chicken breast for the entree, it's tender, juicy, and goes well with the vegetables. (My sister also loves the caramelized scallops, but I've never tried them)

Always save room for their mini indulgences!! They're desserts in a shot glass, and the perfect size for a sweet treat at the end of a good meal. We usually pass them around the table so everyone gets a bite of each! My favorites are the carrot cake, key lime pie, and pecan pie. 

If you love fresh ingredients and delicious flavors, definitely check out Seasons 52. They have healthy options, yummy desserts, and a great environment for family dinners."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect since Seasons 52 has only been open a month or two and was thinking the decor would be more urban loft. But we were very pleasantly surprised. The decor is gorgeous - wood and stone and the tables were placed far enough apart so that you weren't competing with your neighbor's conversation. The service was also excellent.

I had the wood roasted pork loin w/cremini mushrooms and it was cooked perfectly and delicious - the best pork loin I've ever had! My friend had the cedar plank salmon and she also said it was the best salmon she's ever had - and she orders salmon almost religiously whenever she goes out to eat. The mini desserts were amazing - so much taste and flavor in such a little package! I had the pecan pie and my friend had the carrot cake - both excellent.

Seasons 52 also has a very nice wine list with plenty of single glass choices - something that is hard to find in some restaurants. I had the St. Hallett's Gamekeeper's Reserve '08 and it was excellent!

I plan on going back in the very near future with additional friends in order to celebrate Christmas.

I am thrilled with Seasons 52!"}
{"text":"My friend and I dined here as I had been given a gift card and figured it was worth a try.

The ambiance is really nice, casual but sophisticated. 

The menu reminded me a lot of True Food, with lots of unique, healthy and seasonal influences. It is expensive for what you get. My spinach salad was spinach leaves, a few crumbles of blue cheese, maybe 5 walnuts and two halved pears. For the price, it was disappointing. My friends salad was a glorified Caesar salad, that was also not worth the price. In the end, I am glad I had a gift card.

We were sat quickly, and put in an order of gluten sensitive flat-bread, due to my gluten free requirements, to split and two salads. Our flatbread arrived very quickly and we each started to eat. From behind us, we could hear a table complained we had gotten our flatbread before they had. Their waiter then told them, their flatbread went to the wrong table. At that point our waitress came over and advised us we were eating the regular flatbread, not the gluten free. Awesome.

It was replaced and taken off the bill, with an apologetic visit from the manager. However, I still am very disappointed in the mismanagement and lack of attention paid to this.

I have been gluten free most of my life, and only one other time have experienced something like this at a restaurant. I understand personally the 'risk' involved in eating out, however I believe it a restaurant is offering gluten-sensitive or gluten free items, the impetus is also on the leadership and staff to properly train and manage these offerings, so as prevent a something like this, which was so easily preventable. 

Even without the food mixup, which again was taken off our bill with sincere apologies, the food was average in taste, presentation and uniqueness and above average in price."}
{"text":"If I didn't have a gift card, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. I got the lobster flat bread. It sounded a lot more delicious than what it really was. It was just okay. I got the appetizer shrimp with the tomato sauce. The tomato sauce was very flavorful but extremely salty. My husband got the beef tacos. Those were pretty good, on the small side. The mini desserts were very good. Pumpkin spice and raspberry chocolate mouse."}
{"text":"The food was okay. I only tried the happy hour items. I wasn't very impressed but I would have gone back until I checked my. And account and my card was charged 3 times! I probably will
Not
Go back anytime soon if I do I will be taking cash."}
{"text":"Love this place. We have the salmon salad every time. It's outstanding. Great ambience and service. The mini dessert concept is perfect too."}
{"text":"On a busy Valentine's day, the staff were organized upon check in.  A pet peeve I have is when I make a reservation and the restaurant makes you wait!  Say what??  But Seasons 52 kept good time and waiting was kept to a minimun.  It's a huge restaurant with a very broad menu.  So finding something you'd like is likely.  Our waiter was excellent,  friendly and offered suggestions.  The sea bass was one of the best I've had.  My only complaint is that they ran out of rice and made a substitution without telling me first.  But over all I do recommend Seasons 52."}
{"text":"This was our first time to Seasons 52. We went on OpenTable and booked a reservation and the only time available was at 7:45 PM. We called earlier this evening to see if there was an earlier time we were told no but we decide to show up anyways at 6:30 to see if we can get in early. We show up and half the restaurant is empty. We get seated right away and while the service was great, we were called the wrong party name all night and did not get an acknowledgment of our special occasion. The food was excellent."}
{"text":"Had the grilled meatloaf dinner with mashed potatoes and green beans, which was excellent! Only downside was that I wish there had been more sauce for the meatloaf and more mashed potatoes. The potatoes were served in an odd small scoop, like an ice cream scoop.

Service was decent, clean restaurant."}
{"text":"My picks:

Chateau Ste. Michelle Indian Wells, Merlot
Grilled Steak & Cremini Mushroom Flatbread
Grilled Boneless Rainbow Trout
Mini Indulgences (you may need to try all of them)

I am so glad to have another new restaurant choice at the Biltmore.  This restaurant is absolutely gorgeous inside and the staff is amazing!  This is sure to be an instant hit when they open to public on 10/25. I was stoked to get a sneak peak of this place and try a few thing before they opened.  Did I mention that everything on the menu is 475 calories or less?"}
{"text":"It took 20 minutes before we were offered a table.  When we sat down, 7 of the tables were still empty.  When we left, 4 tables remained empty.  So, we were forced to wait 20 minutes for no reason.  Seasons 52 really should do a better job at prioritizing its service.  Customers who arrive without a reservation should be seated just as soon as other customers don't show up on-time for their reservations.

Service was great, food was great, as expected.  Priority seating arrangements need to be reconsidered."}
{"text":"Upon arriving around 7 on a Friday night we didn't have a wait which should have been our first sign that this place wasn't rocking anyone's boats.  We ordered drinks, apps, and entrees.  The second sign that this was not as on point as it's neighbors was the server had a hard time with our drink orders.  He had to go check with the bartender a few times about liquor options and after ordering a Syrah, the waiter asked if I wanted red or white.  The third was the food.  Presentation at best is weird.  My salad came out in a large cylindrical vase and I didn't even have enough time to register that oddity before the waiter lifted and swirled the salad so it fell out of the bottom.  Food falling out of clear objects does not make sense.  The salad dressing was sickly sweet and added to bbq chicken and bleu cheese just a bad combination.  All of the food overall (short ribs, flatbread, shoshito peppers)  felt like I could have made it at home but when we informed the waiter the salad dressing was too sweet he responded by saying he liked it.  Not exactly the best customer service.   I was underwhelmed to say the least and ended up stopping by fast food on the way home."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Service is friendly and attentive.  Food is tasty and surprisingly filling given all the dishes are under 500 calories."}
{"text":"Perfect.

I really could finish the review right there, but for the sake of clarity I will continue. 

Season's 52 name comes from the fact that it changes the menu seasonally and they have 52 wines available by the glass. In addition to the seasonality of the menu, they have an extensive list of specials which changes weekly. There are also changing wine selections. No item on the menu is more than 475 calories, which is pretty amazing.

Our server was Ryan and he was epitome of excellence. Engaging, friendly, there when we needed him, away when we didn't. Knowledgeable of the menu, including the wine list.

I selected a glass of gamay from the sommelier's recommended list and it didn't disappoint.

We ordered the lobster and shrimp flatbread appetizer which was light and delicious, with just a hint of cilantro.  For a starter the gf ordered the beets - tasted great but the presentation was a bit boring. I had the steamed shrimp spring rolls and they were fresh and served with three dipping sauces.

For entrées my vegetarian gf was in heaven and had quite the selection to choose from. She ended up with the seasonal vegetable plate (no surprise, right?) - she was very impressed by both the portion size and the selection (given the 475 calorie limit). I had the rainbow trout served with roasted vegetables and the fish separated from the skin effortlessly and was fresh and moist.

For dessert we selected two of the mini indulgences, which for only $2.50 each are a perfect size and price for the sweet finish to a great meal.

It wasn't until the next day that I found out that Season's 52 is a chain and owned by Darden's (of Olive Garden fame). This really surprised me as it didn't look like a chain and the food and service aren't anything you would associate with a chain, so kudos for them for a job well done."}
{"text":"I met up with a friend for cocktails and appetizers. We sat at the bar and service was great. The staff was very pleasant and attentive. It's a nice sophisticated atmosphere and not too loud. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was good , waiter was in a hurry , I told him at least 4 times that we where not in a hurry and don't need to order yet . Vegetables where excellent especially the parsnips and beets"}
{"text":"Dined here the other evening for restaurant week and was so happy to be back. This is a place my family frequents for special occasions and we are always impressed with the service. The food and service are consistently amazing! 

I love that their menu is seasonal and they use fresh ingredients.

I chose to order off the restaurant week menu and loved everything I ordered. 

I had the chicken pesto flatbread and wasn't disappointed. The texture was perfect and the flavors went together nicely.

The salad was HUGE, I wasn't able to eat as much as I would have liked because I wanted to enjoy my entree.
I ordered the steak for my entree and requested no mushrooms. Everything about it was perfect.

My dad had the restaurant week menu too and enjoyed his salad and salmon. My mom ordered the scallops and she thought they were amazing, as they always are.

The desserts are always one of my favorite parts! I went with the peanut butter one, and my parents enjoyed the key lime pie and the chocolate s'more flavored ones.

Dee was our server and she did SO well. I felt very well taken care of. She did a great job at refreshing our drinks and checking up on us."}
{"text":"We actually eat here all the time. Tonight we decided to choose the offered 3 course meal. My husband found a rubber band in his soup. The manager came over and offered to take the appetizers off our bill and bring us another option. This did not happen. We still paid the regular price for both of our meals. They just didn't charge us extra for the replacement appetizers. Our waiter was awful. Rarely stopped by our table. Food was off. Then only brought us one option for dessert that neither of us like. He said it was because it was a prix fix menu. The menu did not say this. Thanks for ruining our anniversary dinner. Your lame attempts to win us over by giving us a coupon for a flatbread the next time we come in did nothing to fix the night. I am not sure we will ever be back."}
{"text":"Our experience at Seasons 52 for lunch today was excellent.  I had the Ripe Plum Tomato Flatbread and my guests had the Lemongrass Salmon Salad and the Grilled Chicken Caesar Sandwich.  Each dish tasted delicious and was presented creatively and beautifully.  The service was excellent.  

It was hard to believe that each dish had fewer than 475 calories and that the Seasons 52 is part of conglomerate that owns Red Lobster and Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I love the concept of Seasons 52. Healthy food, a menu that changes seasonally, and weekly specials based on what the restaurant can buy fresh. But the beauty of the concept's theory leads to its big downfall. The food is not bad, but it's also not very memorable. Everything on the menu is under 475 calories. That's great considering most restaurant entrees usually are closer to the thousands, but it also leaves you yearning for more flavor. 

We started with the garlic chicken flatbread. It was pretty good. Very garlicky. But Seasons 52 is supposed to be \"known\" for its flatbread. If this is one of the chain's signature dishes, I really would've hoped for more. We had the Salmon and Halibut as entrees. Both were cooked perfectly and had a decent taste. But both plates consisted of fish surrounded by vegetables. It just looked and felt like a bunch of stuff thrown on a plate. I could've done this at home with very little effort. Maybe if the vegetables were pureed and made into a sauce, then this would've have felt like it was worth paying to go out. I'll give Seasons 52 one thing; dessert was awesome. We had the chocolate peanut butter moose and key lime pie. Desserts are put in generous sized shot glasses and only cost $2.50. Hard to say no to that! 

The decor is a little out of place to me. It feels like the ambiance is trying too hard to tell you that this place is high class. The brick and fireplace look screams steakhouse, and doesn't really fit with a theme that you are eating lighter, healthier meals. I don't know how Seasons 52's other locations are decorated, but unless this is a consistent look, it's almost as if the place is trying to justify that it's in the Biltmore. 

The waiter was pretty good. Brett was honest about dishes he liked and didn't like. He also had a lot of energy and was always around to promptly clear plates and refill drinks. Sometimes it actually felt like he was sticking too close to our table. 

I didn't hate Seasons 52. I like the idea behind it, but there's lots of room for improvement. If you're looking to stick to your diet, but not in the mood to cook, then its worth a try. But there's too many good restaurants in and around the Biltmore for me to want to rush right back."}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time for a work meeting and this place is amazing the appetizers, food and dessert are all delicious."}
{"text":"We had a fairly large group graduation dinner here this week, and the restaurant did a great job.  We came in on the late side on a Tuesday so the restaurant was not busy, but they did not rush us at all or treat us like an imposition, which sometimes happens in that type of circumstance.  We were made to feel really welcome.  The menu of drinks is interesting and the restaurant has a broad enough menu to appeal to all tastes.  To sum it up with so many people there, all of who had a good time and were made to feel welcome:

Service:  Very friendly and cordial.  They had this down!  They actually contributed positively to the vibe of our little party.

Food:  Good selection and well prepared.  No complaints.  Everyone found something to eat and enjoyed what they ordered.  Desserts are adorable.  Small portions, which is perfect after a full meal, and a wide selection of interesting little parfait-like goodies.

Ambiance:  Nice, upscale, and still comfortable.

Great job guys!  Thanks for making my daughter's special day even that much better."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with any of the fish dish and it has a cute bar with live piano music.  Great location, wonderful service. The peanut butter mousse dessert is my favorite."}
{"text":"My first visit to this restaurant will likely be my last. I took two mothers here Mothers Day. We had a reservation for 11:30, but we couldn't get a table until 12:00. No big deal. We weren't in a hurry.
Inside, it was not a good experience. Our server was probably stretched thin, but it resulted in slow slow sloooow service at every step from drinks to ordering to food to check. Painfully long. Food was just ok - nothing special. Some of the food was hot, some of it seemed like heatlamp fail. It was a real challenge to get water initially and throughout the meal. It took over 90 minutes to get to a check.
Overall, not an experience to repeat."}
{"text":"Love the idea of sensible restaurant food/portions. Went for lunch and had the blackened fish tacos and for 475 calories, I had 3 decent sized tacos that were good and spicy. The portion was like you would expect at any restaurant, but I didn't have to feel guilty after cleaning my plate. At the end, they come by with shot glasses of different desserts - I had the Meyer Lemon shot glass or whatever they are. Good and tart, and just the right amount. 

We went at lunch and the place was full. The waiter was attentive - he never let a drink go empty and constantly refilled our sodas. 

Enjoyed my meal and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Simply AMAZING!! AWESOME FOOD - WONDERFUL STAFF
Their menu changes every season and they have different specials every week - hence the name Seasons 52.  Each item is also less than 475 calories so it helps those of us who want to watch what we eat.  
We had a fabulous evening!  We were welcomed by a friendly hostess in the lobby who promptly seated us.  As a side note highly recommend reservations.  The staff is well trained, informative and extremely friendly. We felt very comfortable throughout the evening, and fully enjoyed the live piano music.

When seated at our table, our server was Brett, who guided us through our dining experience with knowledge, friendliness and humor. The food was most excellent indeed: we had the Seared Ahi Tuna and the Spicy Chipotle Shrimp Flatbread, followed by the Caesar salad followed by filet with scallops.  (Scallops recommended by Brett and a great recommendation at that).   We further loved the Mini Indulgences, a choice of different desserts in shot-glass size, brought to your table for you to choose from. 

Everything we ate was tasteful and well-seasoned. The food was beautifully plated, fresh and well prepared. We appreciate being able to eat local, seasonal food, and will be back very soon."}
{"text":"The lobster and mozzarella flatbread wasnt as great as i had hoped it would be. The sea bass was amazing. Service was mediocre, and our server charged us for a glass of wine that was merely a sample."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service with a full bar and wine list. I attended a special event here so was limited on my menu choice but will return to sample some of the other menu items. The flatbread pizza was excellent."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed or experience here. The Buffalo Chili and Buffalo Burger were both very good. My wife had the veggie sandwich wgich she enjoyed as well. They focus on lower calorie menu items but that doesn't mean lack of taste with like most places... Service was good. Will definitely be back. Note: If you don't want to valet or pay for parking, park in back of the mall it's free."}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant. I can't believe each dish is 475 calories or less and the portions are still a good size. No sauces, no bread, no fries. The fish tacos were delicious, succulent, with just the right amount of spiciness. The grilled, boneless rainbow trout was fantastic. The pane seared, sushi-grade Ahi Tuna salad was to die for. And leave room for dessert....yes dessert. Only $2.50 but arrives in a shot glass size bowl. just enough to stave off the sugar craving.
The decor is elegant and sophisticated. Great for an executive power lunch or a date to impress. menu changes 4 times a year and features local, fresh, in 'season' food. Very inventive menu starting mainly around $9 (flatbreads and sandwiches) to $16 for lunch. Wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive.
Great food, great atmosphere, great for your waist line. But even if you're not a calorie counter this still ranks right up there for the food quality, taste and presentation."}
{"text":"Last minute late night dinner to celebrate. We made reservations but it wasn't crowded for a Friday night. The food was good and i ordered the caramelized scallops which taste great. I normally hate peas but it didn't bother me. I wish ordered the roasted artichokes. The drink was fantastic Cucumber, parsley and vodka was on point. Nice and quiet atmosphere with good service."}
{"text":"This is the second time dining at Seasons 52. The first time was in Florida. I'm happy to say that the experience was just as good. You can't go wrong with their flatbreads. The menu changes depending on what's in season. We ordered several entrees and each one was cooked well, with great flavor.

The restaurant is located by the biltmore where there are several different dining options. It's worth coming here if you're in the area (or if you're looking for a dinner spot)."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great experience and meal my wife and I enjoyed for Valentine's Day! We had reservations and were seated a few minutes early. Our waiter, Steve, greeted us immediately and engaged us appropriately, not snootily and not too familiar. We shared a California golden beet salad that was generous with the beets and adorned with a little water cress, goat cheese, and a quality balsamic vinegar. My wife's cedar plank salmon was done perfectly and accompanied by roasted vegetables. My wood-grilled pork tenderloin was sitting in a light and perfect au jus and accompanied by roasted vegetables and an absolutely delicious sweet potato mash. The desserts are a collection of mini parfaits. We shared a pecan pie, key lime, and cafe macchiato. Just a few bites of each was a perfect end to a perfect evening!"}
{"text":"Tommy was a fantastic waiter. He was so energetic and informative and made sure everything was gluten free for me! My husband and I shared the tuna tartar and the potato leek soup to start. Both were fantastic! The tartar was a big portion, perfect for sharing, and it had mango, avocado, wasabi, and was so yummy. Tommy also gave me gluten free bread to eat the tartar with! Then for the main course we had the sea bass and the scallops. (These are all off the spring menu by the way, because the menu changes with the season.) The sea bass was really good with an Asian sauce on it. It came on black rice which I though was rather flavorless and gummy. The scallops were really good but the risotto under the scallops was filled with peas and was lacking cheese or a creamy factor that I usually love about risotto. If I go again I would get the tartar for my meal because it was that good! Good food and really big and pretty bar inside."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and amazing food! Even though it is a little pricy the portion size is definitely what you pay for! Love it!"}
{"text":"A little pricey on some of the items, but overall reasonable.  Food experienced thus far has been excellent.  I can personally recommen the scallops over rice!  Great atmosphere as well, and nice sized upscale bar as well.  Was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from my Dentist.  Was looking for a fine dining experience with good atmosphere, great food and with more reasonable price points (Roy's or Flemings).  It was my wife and I's 25th wedding anniversary.  Our server was Karen and she was professional, knowledgeable and friendly.  We started with a seasonal cocktail - grapefruit negroni (gin) and the stuffed mushrooms.  Both served promptly and delicious.  Wife order filet and I ordered the pork tenderloin and we shared asparagus and a garden green salad.  Filet was a perfect medium and well seasoned.  My tenderloin was flavorful and the seasonal fresh vegetables with bacon - delicious.  Karen and wait staff checked in appropriately and were not overbearing.  Finished dinner off with an all chocolate dessert.  It was small but delicious and enough to take the savory edge off.  Atmosphere was very nice.  It was a Tuesday night and the place was buzzing.  Really liked the caloric information provided on the menu.  We felt they did a lot of little things like this to make for a great dining experience.  Will come back and will recommend to others."}
{"text":"Wow.   We thought this restaurant was going to be great based on the price and reviews...   we were wrong.   The food was terrible and we waited more than 30 - 40 minutes to get our food.    We got the Filet Mignon and Lobster Tail.    The filet was really fatty and super bland.   The lobster was incredibly undercooked.    The mashed potatoes were good.   
We were really disappointed and won't be coming back.   For the price, do yourself a favor and go to Mastros for one of the best meals of your life"}
{"text":"This is just an awesome place. My boyfriend and I went there and had a bottle wine. Some artichoke and lamb flatbread for appetizer. I had sea scallops and he had some wood fired pork. All o them were very well prepared and tasted delicious. 
Our waiter was really professional and nice  There was also a lady playing piano and that was defiantly my favorite part. Somehow she played all my favorite music and I was in love with her voice!
Bill comes out around 100 and we had a $25 off American express discount card. It's a little pricy but I think it totally worth it. 
I will definitely come back to this place for their dessert and wine and music again!! I do love Season 52."}
{"text":"This is a really good chain to eat and drink at. Always good food and the bartender's are on top of things."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped by in by chance after driving by the place we were going to try. So happy we went in. The ambiance, the service, the food. ... everything was top. Trey walked us through the wines and menu. We tried the caprese Flatbread, the hummus, and the plank salmon. It was amazing. To finish Trey brought the dessert sample and my girl had the ginger snap pumpkin and I had the key lime tart. Highly recommended! !! We'll definitely be back to this spot. Request Trey, he's the man."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. The food was incredible considering it was only 475 calories. Portions were even good."}
{"text":"The food is always great and the service exceptional, the Piano man came by asking for requests and was a Gentelman.
The Seasonal menus never disapoint and the Lamb was perfect."}
{"text":"I been here a few times before and always had a great experience. I suggest this place to my night out for my boss and her husband so we can celebrate our new business.  We were not disappointed at all. The Atmosphere was perfect. Food was delicious and every came out right on time. We were there for a hour an half and never felt rush. Our serve was also great. I will definitely be back to Season 52 in the future."}
{"text":"I came here for Thanksgiving dinner and man was it busy.  They were able to accommodate our group for a last minute attendance to make it 7.  Off the bat it was great service.  Considering how busy they were that evening I was impressed.  I opted out of the traditional turkey dinner and ordered the pork tenderloin.  Probably the best decision of my day.  It was cooked to perfection!  Thank you Seasons 52 for hosting a perfect Thanksgiving dinner."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place to take your significant other for a romantic evening dinner or drinks and dessert. That's how I experienced this restaurant. 

The interior of the restaurant has that cozy, lights dimmed, non-rushed atmosphere, which in my book equals romantic possibilities. 

The food was very good. My salmon had great flavor and no bones (isn't that how everyone measures salmon?), but the service was exceptional. After mentioning to the waiter my love of Key Lime Pie, his service included checking with the kitchen to see if I could be served a mini indulgence that wasn't offered that evening. The waiter really made me feel as though I'd won the lottery and was dining at the best place in Phoenix. The Key Lime mini indulgence was yummy, too.

I also love how cocktails come with little shakers. I'm not a big martini drinker (more of a margarita drinker), so I tried the Pomegranate Margarita Martini. If you like pomegranate juice and tequila, you'll like this drink, and the little shaker makes it seem as though the drink is double or triple the size of a regular drink.

Because this restaurant is part of the Darden group, a gift card for Olive Garden works here (check the back of the gift card for that information)."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Extremely courteous staff. I had the Farmer's Market Vegetable Plate which was excellent, if not a little on the cold side. Not enough to complain about but enough to keep from giving them a five-star rating."}
{"text":"A nice peaceful afternoon lunch at Seasons 52 was semi-ruined by my higher expectations, so this time around I'm giving the restaurant an average rating. Service was very good but the food was only so-so. Lunch for four (with tax) totaled $140 but I left feeling like I didn't get what I came for.

Here was my portion of the bill:

1. SALAD of Arugula with warm mushrooms, truffle dressing, and parmesan - $8.30
Good. However I should have requested the warm mushrooms on the side so that the arugula could stay much more crispy.

2. An APPETIZER PAIRING of artichoke FLATBREAD with spinach, onions, roasted peppers, and goat cheese with a BOWL of butternut squash soup - $11.00
This was my first time ordering flatbread. I expected it to be crispy and crunchy like a thin crust pizza. It wasn't. Though tasty, it was soggy and ruined my mood while chewing. I didn't want the others see me throw it out, so I managed to get it down and was very happy when all four pieces were gone. The soup on the other hand went to waste. It was too sweet. I've eaten sweet squash before, but this tasted overly sweetened. Yuck! After a few bites I was done with it.

3. VEGETARIAN TASTING entree of kohlrabi steak, vegan paella, asparagus, fennel-roasted onion - $15.60.
Disappointment!
- Alergy warning: the paella had SOY at the bottom. I don't know what kind of soy but it looked like TVP. The menu did not indicate this and I don't know why \"vegan\" food needs to be made with soy. 
- The \"steak\" was nothing more than a small cross sectional slice of a kohlrabi root (tastes similar to turnip root). It was slightly warmed and had some toughness to it. 
- The asparagus and onion were good.

4. Two shots of DESSERT. Pumpkin pie (pumpkin mousse, gingersnap cookie) and pecan pie (vanilla bean mousse, whipped cream, honey-glazed pecans) - $3.00 each.
I am not a fan of mousse because I feel like it skimps, but these were sweet little treats that satisfied the craving in a few bites.

I still like the restaurant and will return in the future, but I'll make sure to ask questions before  I order."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, the service and the food were are all fantastic!! We were there last Tuesday and the weather was still cool outside. You walk inside and there is a cozy, inviting fireplace. 

We took the recommendation of our waiter and started with the goat cheese & artichoke flat bread. It was so thin & crispy with the right amount of toppings that did not weigh it down. I had the mesquite grilled garlic shrimp that came with polenta and asparagus. The shrimp were topped with some sort of diced, cured meat and green olives. I don't eat meat so I picked it out. The olives added a nice saltiness. If you are on a low sodium diet I would not recommend this dish. My husband had the steak & scallops, it wasn't on the menu but our fabulous waiter told us about it. 

We finished off the meal with a pecan pie mousse and a key lime pie, both were delicious and very, very sweet.

I love that Seasons does not have fried food on the menu, all dishes are less than 250 calories and they offer a wide variety of seasonal and vegetarian dishes. I look forward to the spring menu."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with some colleagues.

The wait for the dining area was an hour and a half and up.  We were told if there was space in the piano/bar area, we didn't have to wait.  If anything, you should sit here.  There is a pianist that plays classics, oldies and even top 40.  Pretty neat and relaxing while having a drink and/or dinner!

Since we are first timers, our very attentive server explained the reasoning behind the menu and the name of the restaurant.  The specialty menu changes weekly, hence why the place is called \"52 Seasons\".  The best part?  The food is under 480 calories?  Don't be deceived by that, the portions will fill you up!

Started off with a local and seasonal beer.  Ordered the Kona Crusted T-Bone Lamb Chops.  Three little lamb chop t-bones cooked to your liking with some asparagus and Yukon mashed potatoes.

Asked for it medium since lamb can be a bit chewy when cooked medium-rare, which is how I usually order my meat at a restaurant.

The T-Bone lamb chops was really good and flavorful.  Asparagus added green to your plate and the mashed potatoes was nice and fluffy and flavorful.

Would definitely come here.  Go sit in the bar area and request a song or two from the extensive list!"}
{"text":"Only been here once at the bar, had the burger with grilled veggies. The burger was unbelievable in terms of quality, this is one of the best burgers you can get in Phoenix hands down! Everything about if was quality. U can even use your Olive Garden gift cards here like I did which I recommend doing. Very cool place ."}
{"text":"Had a delightful dinner at seated at table 204, a booth in the bar area, with another couple.  Very expertly served by the charming and very professional Charlyne R. The food is consistently excellent here and it would be our go-to restaurant if it wasn't a bit of a trek from our North Scottsdale home. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love their healthy lunch options, wine selection, happy hour and dinner options, but especially their perfect portion size desserts! Bring back the lemon Meyer dessert!"}
{"text":"Stefan was amazing! I haven't had such great service in a long time. He made so many great recommendations and made sure we had a fantastic time. The food was delicious, we were thrilled and stuffed by the time our group left. Definitely ask to be in Stefan's section, he'll make sure it's a great experience!"}
{"text":"What a dining experience. Top notch service, beautiful restaurant. Had the wild mushroom soup and the lamb that was prepared perfectly. The real treat here is the shot glass desserts, just divine!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful. Well executed on all courses, appetizer, salad, entree and dessert.  I had the sea scallops and they were great."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service.  I would definitely go again.  Went with spouse & an acquaintance for lunch.  We all were happy with the food and the service and, the price was reasonable.  I recommend the Arugula Salad to anyone who wants to eat light.  It was a good sized plate full of salad and the Arugula was very fresh - every piece of it.  No wilted or spoiled pieces in this salad.  What a treat."}
{"text":"Fresh, heathy, elegant, delicious. 

-The atmosphere is classy and warm.
-The food is the perfect portion size, creative, beautifully plated, and very good. 
-The quality ingredients let you enjoy every bite.
-The service is attentive and knowledgeable.


Great restaurant, in a good location."}
{"text":"OK, we decided to come back for Sunday lunch after that credit card fiasco. Wife ordered the flat iron steak and I ordered the rainbow trout. We also shared a flatbread appetizer. They were delicious and unlike most meals we usually have, we didn't feel bloated after finishing the entrees. Which means more room for those miniature desserts, perfect ending for a wonderful meal.

And if not for being pricey for lunch, we'll be back more often. This time though, we paid in ca$h :)"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my sister last week and it was amazing! We made a reservation thinking it would probably be busy on a Friday evening and it was! We were seated upon entering and ordered a couple appetizers. I got the corn soup and it was great! The crispy bacon gave it a crunchy, salty bite. For my entrée I ordered the grilled scallops and they didn't disappoint! The food was cooked perfectly and the service was fantastic! Our drinks were always refilled in a timely manner and our waiter was helpful with our questions about the menu. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Wow the food here was delicious! I loved everything about this place--the service and ambiance were great and there was even free parking available! I got the tuna tartare as an appetizer which was excellent. Afterwards I got the garlic pesto chicken flatbread, which they are known for. Unfortunately,I didn't realize this was not a flatbread sandwich but intended to be more of a shared appetizer. Regardless it was very good. I'd definitely revisit this place, which is located within the bitmore shopping center."}
{"text":"I use to eat at the South Coast Plaza in OC California a lot, every time we had a birthday, baby shower, or promotion we would seem to gravitate toward seasons 52.  The Phoenix location has the usual nice atmosphere and waiters.  All their dishes are under 500 calories, nicely portioned.  Menu changes every season so all the ingredients are always super fresh.  Can't go wrong here if you want a healthy and nice meal out.  I honestly haven't gotten anything here I don't like I am always left wanting more.. is it their small portions or amazing taste? I have yet to find out."}
{"text":"If you like salt...you'll like Seasons 52.   After my wife and I dined on the flatbread, scallops and trout, we were convinced that in order to add flavor to their reduced calories, they poor on the salt.

I read a few reviews here that mentioned bland taste.  Possibly the management read the same reviews and asked their kitchen staff to open the salt shakers?   It really spoiled what could have been a nice experience.

And skip the salads.   Very over priced for what amounts to a plate of mixed greens and little else.  IMO, True Foods does a much better job.

On the pro side, the restaurant is very nicely designed with a pleasant atmosphere and good lighting.  And the wait staff was attentive and polite."}
{"text":"Easily the best eating experience during my time in Scottsdale. 

BRAND EXPERIENCE 
Seasons 52 has a very upscale feel with a very casual undertone. The lighting was dim to set the mood and the deep reds and browns of the room were great additions to the mood. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE
My man Tommy was our server, a cool black dude with a dread hawk, and he was one of the best servers I've EVER experienced. From the moment he walked he was laughs, jokes and suggestions. He listed off his personal preferences, broke down why he felt the way he did and pointed us away from things he didn't enjoy as much because, \"I don't get paid enough to lie to you.\" After our meal he went the extra mile by serving us mini dessert samples of his favorite desserts because, \"ya'll are just so much fun and entertaining for me!\" Needless to say, he walked away with a killer tip. 

FOOD
I had the grilled coffee crusted lamb loins and oh hot damn, it was goooood. The lamb was heavy and savory with a very mellow undertone of coffee. It came paired with sautéed vegetables which were a perfect compliment to the dish. I was also lucky enough to try the Chilean sea bass, a dish that simply melted like butter. Both dishes were expertly prepared and seasoned. 

ALCOHOL
Ever the old fashioned aficionado, I ordered their new old fashion and I was quite pleased. The drink came with an orange zest, blueberry and a stick of rock candy which helped to balance out the strength of the alcohol itself. While it didn't have cocktail ice the ice did melt very slowly.

OVERALL 
I'll be back when next in Scottsdale- and I'm asking for Tommy!"}
{"text":"So, I really wanted to like Seasons 52 based on other comments.  In fact, we've tried it twice in the past 3 months and both times left disappointed.

This last time I ordered the sea bass and black rice.  The black rice was mushy as though it had been sitting too long in the cooker.  The sea bass was cooked well, but then must have sat for a while because the edges were starting to curl up. Since I was with company, I ate it, but about halfway through it had that frozen fish taste so ended up leaving half of a $35 piece of fish on my plate.  The waiter didn't seem to notice or ask me if I liked it.  

Service was poor also.  My water glass was empty for about half my meal before refilled. We asked for the leftover cauliflower to go, it was tossed out.  The waiter said he'd take it off our bill, it was still on the bill.  And one of our party of four ordered the 3 course special which included  dessert.  Our bill came, but no dessert.  By then we all wanted to leave and because it was a dinner with guests, said nothing.  So basically paid for an entire meal and extra vegetables to share that no one ate due to their lack of attention to detail.  Not something I expect at a $35-45/per plate restaurant.  

Truly if this restaurant values their customers, a manager would be reading these reviews, and responding to the negative ones- and making it better.  

We won't be back.  Nor recommend it for business dinners or visitors."}
{"text":"Live Piano Music at the bar and delicious food. They have booth seating in the bar or you can sit around the bar. The dining area is gorgeous with an open kitchen and dim lighting. They have a small corner for group dinners as well. I loved it here, the food and the atmosphere both classy and home-y."}
{"text":"My wife and I live in Chandler, but Friday night we were near the Biltmore strolling around and came across this business.

It is truly a special place . The atmosphere was warm and inviting, and you just couldn't help but to feel the rich (in more than one sense of the word) culture and surroundings.

We sat at the bar for a drink and the first thing I noticed was a pianist and her piano on the middle of the bar on the side where the employees work. She did a mixture of tunes and was quite talented.

Our bartender was more than pleasant and even asked us a couple of personal questions, none that were too invasive.

I ordered a midori sour and asked me to make it fairly strong. He sure listened! Was nice to get a drink that wasn't watered down for only $8.

He also refilled my wife's water glass about 3 times.

Although we didn't have the whole experience of a formal server and meal, I still have no hesitation in branding my 5-star mark on Seasons 52"}
{"text":"I went to Seasons 52 for my birthday & I am happy that I did. We went during happy hour so we basically ordered the whole menu. Duck wings, chicken kabobs, lamb chops, scallops, shrimp scampi, flatbread, wine, beer. The duck wings & chicken kabobs were my favorite. Delicious! The shrimp scampi wasn't what anyone would expect from shrimp scampi, bleh. Our server was very nice & helpful. At the end of the night they offered me desserts to choose from -- the mocha macchiato is delicious!! I was given a card & a rose as well! So thoughtful & pretty!"}
{"text":"We came here spontaneously as it was recommended by a friend. It was quite classy inside, and they treat you classy as well. It's dim setting makes it a nice calm vibe and there's a live piano player in there.

When ordering, they have a menu that's changed every quarter or season, and the other menu is changed every week, thus seasons / 52 weeks. The server greeted us and thoroughly explained the menu. She stated that all menu items are 475 calories or less, which is great. I ordered the seared scallops. It was delicious. The server recommended a Chardonnay that best compliments the dish, which I was also pleased with. My friend who had a particular wine taste didn't like the first selected wine so the server recommended another and she was really pleased with the second recommendation. What's nice is they let you sample the wine before pouring a full glass.

Later there were these desserts in shot glasses and it was a nice sweet treat to end the meal. Great and classy service!"}
{"text":"Liked the meal and atmosphere at Seasons 52, though I would describe both as good, not great.  Menu had appealing diversity of  items, and I was impressed with the concept of all dishes being under a specific calorie threshold.  The food was pretty tasty (Our group tried the filet mignon, pork tenderloin, shrimp with cavatappi, and several salads.).  I found the cavatappi and the sauce for the steak a bit salty but still edible.  We enjoyed the look of the restaurant.  The noise level was very loud, which could be a problem if you are holding a business meeting or trying to catch up with friends.  

We had several fairly minor service issues.  The ice water we requested did not arrive after 30 minutes and multiple requests.  Nor did the starter ordered by one of our group members.  The server corrected these items graciously.  It seemed that the restaurant was short-staffed for the number of guests (This was a Sat evening in late March.).  It appeared that the server was constantly in motion but perhaps had either more tables than usual or less help than usual from food runners or other staff.  

Given Season52's commitment to healthy fine dining, I encourage them  to continue expanding the range of menu options for guests eating low carb foods.  Many dishes on the menu featured carbs such as pasta, rice, or potatoes that people on low glycemic diets can't eat.  I would love to see more options that don't involve grains, starches, or other \"high carb\" carbs."}
{"text":"Seasons 52 serves seasonally inspired ingredients with nothing on the menu more than 475 calories. I think the waiter told us that the main menu changes seasonally while the side menu (specials) are weekly.  The whole menu looked amazing and made it difficult to decide.  I wanted everything, but opted to try a few smaller items to get more flavors/tastes to my meal.

We all started with drinks, some choosing from the extensive wine list and I chose a locally brewed hefeweizen from Oak Creek Brewery.  I decided to start with the Piedmontese Beef and Black Bean Chili.  It had a great flavor, the right amount of heat, but was way too salty for my liking.  I followed up with the Sonoma Goat Cheese Ravioli and the Cider Glazed Grilled Chicken Skewers.  The Ravioli were delicious, light and accompanied by a roasted onion jus, not a heavy creamy sauce.   The chicken skewers also had a perfect char grilled outside, moist inside and came with sun dried cranberries, apple slaw and pumpkin seeds.  I took notice of my dining companions dishes as well and the rack of lamb was making my mouth water.  Perfectly cooked to medium rare with a pomegranate sauce, potatoes and vegetables.  Same goes for the filet mignon which had broccollini as the accompaniment.

Desserts are presented table side in these little shot glass looking containers.  There just enough to satisfy your craving for something sweet without pushing you over the edge with a huge dessert.  I had something with chocolate, chocolate and more chocolate...yum.  There were 7 or 9 to choose from and all $2.95 I think.

Service was impeccable.  He recognized our friends who live in the area and welcomed them back.  Patient with the two \"newbies\" and took time to explain everything to us since it was our first visit.  There is a piano in the middle of the bar and perfect background music to enjoy a great dinner."}
{"text":"Went to Seasons 52 at the Biltmore Fashion Park in Phoenix AZ for lunch today.

Had the Roast Leek and Potato Soup and Garlic Chicken Pesto Flatbread combination.  It was very good.

Wanted to have dessert, but for some reason Biltmore Fashion Park uses a bizarre system of little yellow plastic discs rather than printed tickets in their parking lot, so you have no way of knowing how much of your two hours free parking (with validation) is left.

Next time I will look at my watch when I park at Biltmore Fashion Park.  Wonder how much business the stores and restaurants in Biltmore Fashion Park lose because of these bizarre yellow plastic discs."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is loud. It doesn't look like it because of the dim lighting and high ceilings, but I've been here numerous times and had issues conversing with people due to the noise level (other patrons, music). 

The main menu rates at 3.5 stars, because you can taste the freshness of the ingredients, but often times the flavors are not noteworthy. TruFood doesn't seem to have this problem.

Where this place really shines is the desserts! They come in little double shot glasses, and are INCREDIBLE. Just the right size for the richness that each one packs. I bumped it up to 4 stars just for the desserts.

Service is what you would expect, usually very good. The worse part is that the host/hostesses seem to get flustered if you don't have reservations. They want to enter you into their system etc."}
{"text":"11/3/2017. At around 7:10 pm we came to have dinner. Man hostess indicates there is no empty spaces available. We left and found out half of the place was empty. My wife went back to him to tell him that half of the place is empty. Good luck summer time"}
{"text":"Happy Happy :)
Great service and food! I am a vegetarian and they had a really beautiful platter . Presentaion and taste were exceptional. I will go back again . I highly recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"It' a good thing Culver's is right down the road.  No bread, no potato and leaving hungry.  Real small portions of anything won't exceed 475 calories. 

To top things off, the waitress brought the food and told us the seafood was cooked medium well.  We said \"we ordered it well done\".  She replied \"well, if that is how you ordered it, I'm sure that is the way it's cooked.\""}
{"text":"We sat at the piano bar. My date ordered a 2010 Mirassou Pinot Noir. $6.75. This Monterey County wine has flavors of cherry, strawberry, red currant notes and is well balanced. I drank Bombay Shapphire martinis, three olives. $10.50, I love this gin's predominant juniper berry flavour.

Sipped an amazing lobster bisque and a luscious butternut squash soup. $6 each. Also enjoyed a spicy Chipotle Shrimp Flatbread with grilled pineapple, Feta cheese and roasted poblano peppers.$10. Finished with their mini indulgences, chocolate peanut butter mousse and a pumpkin pie mini with double gingersnap crust. $2.50 each.

The restaurant concept delivers a sophisticated, masculine and casual atmosphere. The seasonal menu offers fresh ingredients and can deliver lower-calorie option. JJ Jones at the piano was a pleasure to listen to and chat with."}
{"text":"Attentive service. Healthy and good options if you're watching the waistline :)"}
{"text":"I went here the day before valentines day. This place was still busy, but when you're seated, they take good care of you. 

The food itself is good but not at a caliber that I expected for this type of restaurant, but I understand they boast about the lower calorie intake in their entrees which I appreciate. The brussel sprouts still seemed over cooked.. Almost mushy. And the fish of a texture or toughness that I didn't expect. The scallops were perfection though. You get a good amount of pieces! The squash risotto underneath was interesting .. Good. But interesting.

The lobster flatbread was good. But again, not outstanding that I need to have it again. 

The ambience was very nice."}
{"text":"Right now Seasons 52 seems to be a hot topic of places to try and coincidently I had dinner there last night and lunch there today. I have two separate groups of friends that I had the opportunity to experience this with and I must say they all said similar things. Their comments on the duck,  lamb, chicken skewers, and crab cake appetizers were amazing. However, the price a bit costly for the portions your given. My comments, I'm not a big seafood person so the crab cakes were too \"Fishy\" for me and inconsistent from the flavor the night before. I agree the chicken was delicious and for lunch I tried the bacon & fig flatbread, absolutely amazing! My favorite the mini desserts!!! We tried 4 of the 8 and they were very tasty! I probably won't go back only because it seems to be targeted more towards exotic foods and in I'm a little more simple. It's a great place to try. Great atmosphere, good service. Thanks Tiffany and Maggie!"}
{"text":"Seasons 52, as the star rating indicates, is A-OK. Our hilariously sarcastic server was the surprise highlight of an otherwise unmemorable dining experience. 

The interior is darkish and attractive, if a litlle ho-hum. A piano sits in the center of the bar area and there is live music nightly, though our dining companions who had been there before described the setup as \"loud and awkward\".

Tucked away in the main dining room, our little group of four decided to order a number of items for the table to share: Thyme & Parm Crispbread, Garlic Chicken Flatbread, Artichoke Stuffed Artichoke Leaves, Crab Stuffed Mushrooms, and the dinner-sized portion of Goat Cheese Ravioli. Everything was palatable, though I couldn't really recall any particular dish without taking another peek at the menu. I appreciate the 'under 475 calorie' approach, but unless you limit yourself to one item it's really not much of a dietary coup.

We each ended our way-over-475-calorie meal with a mini indulgence: Key Lime Pie, Pecan Pie, Peanut Butter Mousse, and Bananas Foster. I have to admit the shooter sized portions are ingenious and all were absolutely scrumptious (with the exception of the Bananas Foster, which was sugar-free and had that unpleasant sweetener aftertaste).

All in all, we had a pleasant dinner, but I most likely wouldn't initiate a return visit. With so many other standout options in the Biltmore area, for me, A-OK just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I love that everything is sustainably made and healthy. The menu is amazing and the service was absolutely fantastic as well. Would recommend this spot to anyone wanting to have a delicious healthy meal out, but it is a bit pricy so it's not for the every day dinner."}
{"text":"Very good food, wine, service and ambience.  Everyone enjoyed what they had and the prices were reasonable for the quality and portion size.  The Price Fix menu was a great value with the included salad and dessert.  They also have a fantastic selection of wines by the glass.  I particularly like how the pour your glass from the bottle at the table and allow you to taste it before the full glass."}
{"text":"First time here and now I am a fan!!! Food was super tasty! It's like you knew what my taste buds were asking for in every way possible!! Kimberley and Seth were superb and made me feel right at home with their super-pleasant natural nature! I love how the entire staff (all the way from the greeters to the kitchen and beyond) get along with each other! Excellent atmosphere indeed!! Thank you!! My hats off to you all!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here!  Service is great and consistent.  Great for business lunches.   All meals under 600 calories,  but you'd never know it.   I could eat lunch here every day and never get tired of it."}
{"text":"Just visited Seasons 52 for dinner tonight during restaurant week. The salmon was amazing, tasted a bit of the filet mignon which was very well cooked, and the quail too. Yum! Had the corn soup and it was a perfect compliment to the tomato flatbread. Tasted the chocolate and peanut butter desert...couldn't have asked for anything better."}
{"text":"Enjoyable Bistro with Fine Touches

Attended a work dinner at S52, in one of the rear meeting rooms. First, the service staff was very attentive and quick about their work. Plates landed together and were accurate to the order, drinks we kept relatively \"afloat\", courses did not linger when done, and there was plenty of engaging banter.

Food was very good and what one would expect for this type of upper-end establishment. Truthfully, the menu is the only way I can tell the difference between S52 and Capital Grille, next door. The fish and vegetables were okay... a tad bland to my taste. The preceding salad was a enjoyable. And the desserts were especially yummers. 

The setting is dark, candle-lit, with stone and wood accents. Worth the visit. It's the kind if place I imagine taking my wife to for anniversary dinners in our retirement years. :o)"}
{"text":"Which for happy hour. Great selection of food, all for five dollars. The portions were small but very tasty. Good choice of drinks also on happy hour. I would come back"}
{"text":"We went out for my birthday and Lou was our waiter - he was quite awkward.  We had stuffed mushroom apps that were delish and basil tomato flatbread, also good.  I ordered top shelf margaritas that were watered down and not that tasty.  Their top shelf for tequila was Patron Silver - not impressed.  The entrees were well presented, I had the lamb with asparagus and mashed.  The mashed was superb.  The lamb was good, on the bone.  They offer small desserts that are included with your meal.  I had the pecan pie and my friend had the lime pie.  We both enjoyed.  I came back from the restroom and my candle was lit and it is awkward from Lou telling me to make a wish as he had not really connected with us at all that evening.  In essence, the food was great but the service was average.  We had a better waitress in the bar area, but again, the drinks were not impressive."}
{"text":"My spouse and I had dinner at Seasons 52 on a busy Saturday night.  We shared orders of flatbread with artichokes and stuffed mushrooms as appetizers. Then I ordered the rack of lamb as a dinner entre while he had the sea scallops. We washed it all down with a bottle of white wine, and dinner was followed with a small complimentary dessert item of our choice from a tray brought to the table. All of our meal was delicious, though I ordered my lamb chops medium-well and they came out a little over the point of well done--but were still quite moist and tasty. The service was delightful, but the place felt a touch overstaffed to me with personnel and patrons frequently bumping into one another. We had a discount coupon, but nevertheless the tab came to nearly $100 before tip.  That struck me a little pricey. I think this restaurant should be listed by Yelp as $$$ pricing NOT $$. Also, I think  the Seasons 52 wine list needs the help of a sommelier because I didn't see much very interesting, as it appeared comprised mostly of common grocery-store wines at prices inflated $5-$10/bottle more than comparable restaurants. I'd happily go back again for dinner sometime but probably only with another coupon."}
{"text":"Dined here again for New Year's and it was great! Our entire group was satisfied! Love their desserts. I'm definitely a fan of Seasons!"}
{"text":"As always a delicious meal, special menu for Restaurant Week was perfect and an awesome price point.  But best of all was the \"visiting\" server Kristie Schwarz!  Too bad she's not permanent, but will look her up if I go to Seasons 52 in Colorado!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a lovely atmosphere with articulate and helpful staff and a seasonal and healthy menu. When I was a healthy eater, I cared a lot more about this restaurant than I do now. Now I come here with my healthy eating friends who really enjoy it while I usually leave feeling a little bit underwhelmed. The food is high quality but their attention to low calorie and low sodium fare leaves my fat self feeling a little bit disappointed. However, they do have desert offerings that are lovely and perfectly sized for individuals or sharing."}
{"text":"Good food. Beautiful atmosphere. Horrible service. My team went there for lunch today..we were there 30 minutes before our order was taken.... In fact we had to ask for someone to send over our server because she completly disappeared.the horrible service continued for the duration of our dining experience.. Unfortunately it ruined our holiday luncheon to the point our manager decides we will not be going back to seasons 52 in the future."}
{"text":"Great happy hour - the lamp chops are fab-u-lous! We received a gift card and recently used it for an evening out. We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of food, atmosphere and service (as we didn't know what to expect). We will enjoy going back sometime."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! My fiancé and I made a reservation on Open Table and were seated right away. Our server was lovely and came to our table within a minute of us being seated. We were able to get our drinks and look over the menu. My fiancé got the lamb shank (he loved it) and I got the cedar plank salmon. Oh my goodness, it was beyond delicious. Our food was also served quickly, within 15 minutes of us putting in our order. The desserts were yummy and satisfying. As we got our check, the server presented is with us with a Happy Anniversary card and a red rose! I've never been to a restaurant that went out of their way to provide something of that sort. Our server also took our two desserts off the bill. Overall, we were both extremely satisfied and would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. Great food, great cocktails, great service! 
I can't sing Seasons praises enough. 
I'm highly impressed when someone remembers my name on the second visit. Turned me into a 52 \"regular\". Love it! Keep up the awesome work guys!"}
{"text":"I'm enthusiastic about any place that manages to both be conscious of the caloric values of what they put on the plate AND the variety and tates of foods offered. And that's what Seasons 52 does.

Nothing on the menu goes above 450 calories or so, and the server will guide you on real values.

The menu changes through the year, focusing on what is truly in season (thus the Seasons 52). 

I had the flatbread for lunch and found it delicious and filling at only 400 calories or so. The service was quick and the surroundings were nice. Back in 1992 I was a starving student, so I don't recall how \"nice\" restaurants looked back then. Maybe they looked like this?

I think we need more of this. It's a health-conscious restaurant that doesn't seem like penance. I plan to go back."}
{"text":"On a recent visit with friends, I had the Grilled Boneless Rainbow Trout with baby carrots and crushed roasted potatoes. SO GOOD, haven't had rainbow trout like this in years. The service was great and attentive. Drink was refilled before I had to ask. My friends had the Maui Tuna Crunch and the Oak-Grilled Filet Mignon, both of which were enjoyed. This would be a great place to take someone you want to impress."}
{"text":"I had never been here before and when a friend suggested it, I jumped at the opportunity to try this place. And I am so happy I did! A cozy yet elegant atmosphere with beautiful decor. Great place to unwind and have a fabulous dinner. I had the stuffed mushrooms to start with shrimp,crab and spinach as the filling...delightful! And for my entree I had the Wood grilled filet and it was superb! Cooked to perfection. And to top it off- the key lime,Smore's AND pecan individual desserts....Absolutely the perfect ending! Thank you seasons 52 for a wonderful meal with friends!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to dinner and it was my first time at Seasons 52. The food was amazing! Our server was very friendly and even gave us a free dessert because we were celebrating my promotion."}
{"text":"After reading some of the more recent reviews we were a little concerned about what might happen if we ate here. Whatever the previous customers experienced was atypical. As it was a Monday evening we didn't make a reservation and we were seated at a booth immediately. There were a number of tables already occupied and a steady flow of customers kept the place busy. Our waiter, Trey, greeted us, explained everything, took our drink order, and our food order with a smile and served everything correctly and efficiently. We had the Karluk River salmon and the sea bass with a wine flight and a cocktail. The food was superb. At the end of the meal the dessert tray was presented and deciding which one to have was a real challenge. We wanted key lime pie, which was not on the menu, but Trey went to the kitchen for us and found that they actually had some so we got what we wanted. This extra service made the meal a resounding success. A great dining experience that we highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is the second time that I've dined at Seasons 52, and for my brother, it his one of his top choices when in town. The FOOD is EXCELLENT, and the wait staff is wonderful. If you'd like the best waiter, request Tommy. His knowledge of the menu items, his attentive service, and vibrant personality make for more than just a dining experience, but an evening of enjoyment & a perfect meal for everyone at the table. His wine suggestions were spot on, as well. 

The ambiance is warm, with much of the interior in dark wood, divided well, and some private booths. The long open kitchen, with flaming grills, lines one side of the large restaurant. So, if you're a foodie, you can be seated near the \"chef action.\" I also noticed a private room for events.

The FLATBREAD starter is a must; thin crispy crust, and (our choice) Garlic Pesto Chicken is enough to feed 4 people, as an appetizer, and at least one person as an entrée.

My brother had the ASIAN-GLAZED CHILEAN SEA BASS (with
black rice, snow peas & shiitake mushrooms, topped with a garnish of micro wasabi sprouts). He said that it was light & flakey, it was nicely glazed, and would recommend.

One of the surprise stand-outs was the MEATLOAF. Two slices, crosshatched from the FIRE GRILL, were topped with a thin coating of special BBQ GLAZE. This did NOT taste like your ordinary meatloaf. It had a flavor-packed blend of tiny, shredded carrots, mushrooms, onions, breadcrumbs, and herbs mixed well with delicious, quality, grass-fed sirloin. The side dishes were Yukon Mashed Potatoes & Green String Beans (which they serve very al dente).
If you prefer your green beans soft, you'll have to ask. This is a seasonal restaurant that serves the freshest food, the freshest way.

I had the PORK TENDERLOIN which was Wood Grilled, moist, and my vegetables were the green beans, cut, with crumbled, crispy bacon, and a few pearl onions just for flavor. The pork tenderloin rested against spectacular sweet potatoes. I kept thinking, \"sweet, savory, sweet, yum.\" Great combo of flavors: recommend

The biggest surprise dish of this night, was the SHRIMP & GRITS, which may sound crazy, but it was an entrée of creamy, slightly cheesy, not seafood-tasting deliciousness! An ample amount of shrimp, with a delicious taste of bacon, covers an amazing blend of grits and polenta that are cooked in a creamy, slightly cheddar cheese. Definitely Recommend

And now, for the FAMOUS SHOT GLASS DESSERTS:  You'll have to see my video, where Tommy explains each of them.
I tried (& recommend) all of the following:

   \"MOCHA MACCHIATO\" ~ Caramel is topped with a layer of vanilla bean mousse, then chocolate cake is topped with mocha mousse and finished with a swirl of whipped cream and a white chocolate straw. 
   \"KEY LIME PIE\" ~ Layers of graham cracker crumbs and fresh key lime filling are topped with a flame toasted swirl of meringue. 
   \"BELGIUM CHOCOLATE S'MORE\" ~ Delicious chocolate cake topped with rocky road mousse, a marshmallow, and a half chocolate-dipped graham cracker for garnish
   \"CARROT CAKE\" ~ It tastes just like a perfect carrot cake, with a pinch of cinnamon and a layer of cream cheese frosting in the middle! 
   \"CHOCOLATE, PEANUT BUTTER TORTE\" ~ Two layers of chocolate cake with peanut butter mousse including crushed peanuts, topped with a swirl of whipped cream and a peanut tuile in the top for a delicious garnish. 
  \"PECAN PIE\" ~ This one is the sweetest. On top of vanilla mouse is a layer of caramel and pecans which is topped with a swirl of whipped cream and a pecan half.
   \"RASPBERRY CHOCOLATE CHIP CANNOL ~ This is the only one that I forgot to try, and it probably would've been my favorite. It was a raspberry and chocolate chip mousse, with raspberry coulis layered throughout, and it had a miniature cinnamon cannoli shell in the top.

Everything there has always been fantastic!"}
{"text":"Always appreciate the good food and service at Seasons 52.  They do an excellent job with local, seasonal foods."}
{"text":"My networking group has just started meeting at Seasons 52 on a weekly basis in one of their private rooms. The menu was great, the food delicious and the wait staff very attentive. I am so glad to have this new restaurant the Biltmore area. I will become a regular patron outside of my networking events. As an interior designer, I find the decor to be elegant and very pleasing without being over the top. Well done!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Everything 475 calories or less?!?!?! That means I can have 4 things and still eat healthier than I would by getting a value meal at fast food. (I wouldn't though). There is a different special menu every week, hence the 52, to showcase foods that are in currently in season. I love this restaurant concept. 
The decor is very dark, yet comfy. Reminds me a bit of a supper club without the large round booths. There's also a few private rooms which would come in handy for a lovely bridal shower, work meeting, birthday party, etc. I'm always on the look out for great restaurants with private rooms. 
My coworkers and I had lunch here. They both had a cup of buffalo chili to start. I kind of wish I had too because it smelled awesome. They both said it was great. It's made with black beans rather than the usual kidney. I love black beans and hate kidney. It really looked like it was just meat in there. I'm glad I didn't get it though because then I'd be too full to work the rest of the day. 
I ordered the chicken chile relleno with spinach, goat cheese, and corn cakes. Yum!!! I have no idea how this deliciousness is less than 475 calories!! Soooooo good and sooooo filling.  Not too spicy either for those who like food on the tame side.  My friend got the pork taco flat bread and said it was amazing. My other coworker got the mahi tuna salad and it looked awesome. He said it was great. 
We were slightly tempted to try one of the mini desserts. The cocktail menu was tempting as well. I look forward to coming back here not during my workday to indulge."}
{"text":"I went here during the holiday and had an excellent meal. I can agree that the booth fabric is quite terrible but the food is great. I expected to be let down for some reason as when I usually try something that looks like it should be a great place it usually isn't (Nobuo, god you're terrible!). We had the shrimp,mushroom,crab lump then I had the filet mignon and she had the cedar plank salmon. I had a tea and she had two of the orange martinis. Here are a couple points:

The appetizer was very good I was surprised how tasty it was, perfect mixture of the ingredients.

It was lunch but they allowed me to order from the dinner menu which was great cause I really wanted a steak. The steak itself was on par with Phoenix City Grille
which is good but I have yet to find one that compares to Circa 1900's but it is better than anything in current memory.

My girlfriend loved the martinis, she is usually underwhelmed but this place and Switch seem to be her new faves.

The salmon was cooked exactly the way she wanted and she really liked it.


The staff we encountered were super accommodating the waitress was prompt and ready for a refill at all times and I go through 6 glasses of tea easily. One of the cooks(kitchen staff?) who brought the meals out also was helpful in that regard as well as the person whom I believe was the manager who came over and delivered the second martini.

So great food for what we tried, great drinks, killer service, and some odd fabric choices(should you even care?)"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Seasons 52 in a while, but I went there today for lunch to meet a couple of business associates. When I got there, I gave the front receptionist my name, and they said I was the first to get there. They seated me at a table and I sat there for almost 15 minutes wondering where the rest of my party was. I had sent out a text, and then one of my business associates walked over and stated that they were sitting at a different table for almost 20 minutes waiting for me.

After I joined them, it took the waiter 10 minutes to get me an iced tea. When we finally ordered, I chose the grilled salmon salad. When it came out, it had a great presentation. The salad was in a round clear cylinder, which the waiter then lifted off and the salad came pouring down to mix itself. It was very cool! I've never seen this presentation style before. The salmon was absolutely delicious, but the dressing on the salad was a bit strange. 4/4.

The rest of the meal went well, with very prompt and pleasant service. When we were done, we were presented with a beautiful dessert tray. Because I was on a diet, I didn't have any dessert (but I wish I could of)! The interior of the dining area is very nice inside of the restaurant, and it has an overall impressive ambience. But for the initial snafu at the front desk, I would have  awarded five stars."}
{"text":"Just like my favorites in Fort Lauderdale & Tampa this Seasons 52 serves up the BEST FLATBREADS I have ever had!!!.....those plus the signature shot glass desserts, ( peanut butter/choc.mousse), are standouts worth the trip!!......the 475 max.calories per entree is appealing, the bar scene quite cool, but the rest of the menu could use a little pop..........."}
{"text":"Been to the California location years ago and just thought it was okay. Gave it another shot when this Biltmore location opened for dinner with a group of friends and I really enjoyed it! We had the fish and chicken snd it was delicious.  I like how there is a lot of veggies and everything isn't drenched in butter and salt. My husband was not as enthusiastic about the lack of carbs and the amount of vegetables :) Desserts are cute little 3 bite servings that don't make you feel like you have to roll yourself out of the place.  The service was top notch. They even have a private room that would be perfect for a nice dinner party! We will be back off sure :)"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been impressed from start to finish visiting a restaurant for the first time.  The initial draw was knowing they have a seasonal menu as well healthy options - oh and to be really honest - the mini deserts had me curious as well!  Great atmosphere and décor - the place is large, open (while remaining intimate), clean and comfortable.  Service was excellent!  

The variety that we enjoyed for the price - it truly shocked me.  The quality of food and its presentation was excellent.  If you follow our order... I think you will be delighted...

We started with the side of Brussels as an appetizer - which included fresh cut garlic and bacon - yum.  The Wood Grilled Pork Tenderloin - cooked perfectly with fresh sides (split plates), a very tasty natural pepperoni Flat Bread and a Shrimp Scampi Skillet (the sauce drenches 2 pieces of bread that the shrimp lays on top off - unique).  The meal was made complete by selecting from our servers presentation of mini decadent desserts (I went with the apple and she with the s'mores).

Wonderful food and location - the eating healthy went out the window - but so worth it.  Seasons has moved to my tops to revisit.   I didn't realize it was at the Biltmore till we got there, so great place to walk around after a meal, 2 hour parking free with validation."}
{"text":"We only went because someone gave us a giftcard. 

The front hostesses were snobby and wouldn't seat us even though the restaurant was pretty empty as it was early on Saturday night. We walked around for a little bit and came back then they seated us right between 2 large parties, one with 15 people and the other with over 20. Great start.

Here are the issues with Seasons 52:
-Servers seem like newbies, not very knowledgeable and made not so great recommendations
-Clientele was kind of trashy
-Underwhelming menu...brussel sprouts and burrata salad? Not really a surprising menu
-Flatbread - chicken pesto, not enough chicken nor pesto
-Shrimp and grits - way too many tomatoes and not enough shrimp, texture was basically soup

We won't be dining here again."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I have eaten here about 4 times now and each time I leave with a positive experience.  Servers are always polite and attentive.  I love that they are a calorie conscious restaurant.  Every dish I have ordered has been delicous and in my opinion, the prices are very reasonable.  One of my favorite places to entertain clients."}
{"text":"We were excited to see that they had a 3 course meal for $30. However, there was no vegetarian option, so we could not each get the meal. So we decided to each get an entree. The shrimp scampi was yummy, but the ratio of shrimp to noodles was way off. There was 5 shrimp and only a couple pieces of pasta underneath. The lobster flatbread was yummy as was the tomato flatbread. The salmon was the best salmon I had ever tried. However, the steak was under seasoned and the mushroom sauce was cold. The waitress was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu, but because of the bland tasting steak, and lack of vegetarian options on their special spring deal, we will not be back."}
{"text":"This review is a little overdue as we ate there on Thanksgiving day.
We were a party of 10, 7 adults, 3 children aged 3-6. With our reservation, they gave us the semi-private area just to the right of the front door and the setting couldn't have been nicer for our larger group.

Only 2 in our group chose the traditional Thanksgiving dinner on offer. Luckily, my husband was one of the 2, so I got to sample most of the items on his plate. Both the white and dark meat turkey were very flavorful. The platter overflowed with the usual sides, green beans, mashed potatoes, dressing, cranberry sauce and (if I recall correctly) a butternut squash puree. This choice included a mini-pumpkin pie, also delicious. Very reasonably priced at around $27, and tasty.

I chose the sea scallop entree and was pleasantly surprised. The meal came on a long oval platter and featured about 8 large, nicely caramelized sea scallops on a bed of butternut squash risotto, sided by grilled broccolini. I was pleased I went with this rather than the Thanksgiving fare.

Our server was delightful, prompt and professional. I think everyone in our party was pleased with our selection of Seasons 52 for the Thanksgiving meal. We may have started a new family tradition."}
{"text":"Season 52 is conveniently located on Camelback and 24th st, parking best in back on shopping center.  

Started at bar while waiting on Ladies for Book Club, Bartender was super nice about closing out check to move to take.  At the Table our Server Billy was very nice, and was able to keep everyone orders straight.  Sometimes a big group issues start but not with Billy. 

I had the Flatbread with two glasses of wine; the Lobster & Fresh Mozzarella surprisely it was  delicious.  Also tried the Meatballs which are tasty perfect seasoning and scallops which were cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Very nice business dinner
We came here on a business dinner with 10 people.  We had a reservation for 13, which they said was no problem when we were only 10.  The decor is very cool and unique.  We were seated promptly and our server greeted us immediately.  She did a fine job of monitoring our progress, taking the orders, bringing food and refilling drinks.  The food was all very fresh, VERY well prepared and very well presented.  The portions were moderate sized, but they all have to be under the 475 calorie mark.  They do a great job of mixing ingredients to give you a well balanced plate.  I had the surf and turf special and it was perfect.  the deserts are very cool, served in little shot-like glasses.  I preferred the pecan pie with fresh caramel.  It was better than the other 2 I tried.  The dining area is a little loud, so be prepared if it is busy, it will be loud.  One word of caution, they pour the drink heavy, so be careful :)"}
{"text":"This eveNing didn't start to well.  They did thru didn't have our reservations.  Not good. I received a confirmation that downloaded to my calendar.  Then  we st down another manager came over &days you must be  De Klark's, we both corrected him.  He said he just seated another couple down & greeted them with our name. He said that they must have mixed up our reservation. We told him they told us they said they didn't have a reservation for us.  He asked is if we wanted anything to drink we ordered a strawberry Basil Fusion Martini. The server came & brought us a Strawberry Coconut Martini,  she had us try it since she was told the wrong cocktail. Neither of us liked it so she ordered  we wanted.  The food was good,  we both had the Rack of lamb. Our server asked if we were celebrating a special occasion we told her it was our Anniversary,  she said you should have told us,  I explained when i made the reservations i did tell them.  She brought us a  champagne toast & com'd our dessert. The rest of the evening has been wonderful.  After  we went to the bar & listened to the pianist for a wonderful closure to our anniversary evening!"}
{"text":"Astonishingly delicious.

Every time I'm here, I make sure to get the chipotle shrimp.  I normally never enjoy shrimp that much, but this may be the best appetizer I've ever had.  People at the table fight over who gets how much.

I've never gotten anything other than the Oak-grilled filet mignon: it's the best I've had in Phoenix.  My girlfriend thoroughly enjoys the Pork Tenderloin, and I've loved every bite I've had from her dish too.

Maybe the coolest thing is the desert shots, too.  They're like $4 and individual-sized, so it's reasonable for everyone to get something that they like.  My personal favorite is the Key lime pie, and I can't see how you could make a case for anything else."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. I love the concept of a menu that changes with the seasons. I love the concept of every item on the menu having 475 calories or less. My only complaint, one typical of other men I've talked to about the restaurant, is that the small portions often leave me hungry. My wife, like most women I've talked to about Seasons 52, begs to differ. She tells me the portions are perfect, especially for an aging male. Ouch! Unfortunately, I think she's right. 

I've been mainly a lunchtime visitor. Generally, the food is flavorful, the presentation thoughtful, and the service prompt, which is as much as you can hope for in a chain restaurant. I'm also a big fan of the mini desserts. Conveniently, Seasons 52 also has specific menus available upon request for vegans, vegetarians, lactose sensitive, gluten sensitive and those needing low sodium."}
{"text":"I had a good experience here. Nice selection of food for either vegetarian or the meat eater. The shrimp app was my fav of all the dishes I tried.  All of my food was very good and I really don't have any complaints expect it was just missing that little\" somethin' somethin'\" that will make me want to go back again...know what I mean?? Prices are all around pretty fair. 

I left full and slightly more buzzed than intended..thanks to the heavy handed bartender :)"}
{"text":"We've heard so many good things about this place and wanted to try it out. First, we ordered cocktails, I got a cucumber gimlet and asked for it to be a little sweeter. My drink arrived and there was no simple syrup in at all so I asked for a glass of ice with simple syrup, I got a cup of syrup with no apology. We ordered a Greek dinner salad and tomato and avocado salad, they were nothing special. My tomato and avocado salad was drenched in dressing, it was difficult to eat. Our witness was m.i.a so we could not send it back. My boyfriend ate it so it would not go to waste. For dinner, I ordered scallops with corn risotto and the risotto was runny. Once again our waitress was no where to be found. She did not check on us at all during dinner and we wanted to order more cocktails. She finally came around when plates were ready to be picked up. Overall, our experience was not what we expected. We frequently eat at Steak 44, Ocean Prime, and Mastros and for some reason I thought we would get 10 star service and food. But we were definitely wrong and so disappointed in the overall experience. We felt invisible in a place that was to provide excellent service from what we heard. Definitely, not in a rush to coming back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place. We need more places like this - aspiring to be healthy while not sacrificing delicious food, offering a high end restaurant experience, all at very reasonable prices. What's not to love?!

The concept here is that everything on the menu is under 475 calories, and delicious. However, it doesn't mean that you can just have just one item and be satisfied. For example, our group shared several apps, I had an entree, and we each had desserts. You can easily break 1000 calories in a meal, but that's better than breaking 3000 calories for a similar experience elsewhere.

We tried several of the flat breads for appetizers and they were all delicious, but not very filling as they were on a paper thin crust.

I had the the special which was a wild caught salmon filet. It was absolutely superb, probably the best cut of salmon I've ever had. It had a depth of flavor only found in wild salmon, and though it was leaner than farmed salmon, it was cooked to absolute perfection: moist and flakey all the way through. 

We had several VERY nice bottles of red wine during dinner - though I wasn't ordering, so I can't name any of them. I think we had a pinot noir and a cab, and perhaps something more exotic. 

For dessert, we ordered nearly all of the single serving dessert cups, and folks just picked whatever looked best. I'm not sure what mine was called, but it had several layers of chocolate cake, chocolate mousse, and whipped cream. It was fantastic, and saved me from my usual dessert time behavior of gorging after a full meal. 

Kudos for Seasons 52 turning the high end restaurant experience on it's head. I look forward to more restaurants moving in this direction."}
{"text":"What a great concept, They successfully managed to make a calorie friendly menu without forsaking taste.  The menu changes with the season and they also have a weekly menu.

I do think the deco is a little circa 1992, however my counter part rather enjoyed it.  Bar is huge and cozy, great happy hour I would think.  

I had enjoyed the following less 475 calories dishes
Mussels - nice red sauce and cooked perfectly
Flat bread:  I had both the Reuben and Chipolte shrimp with crushed pineapple, WOW
Cab Chicken - nice healthy, great flavor, came with golden beets which I have not had before, very pleasant surprise
Peanut butter and Chocolate mini dessert and Red Velvet Cake mini

The FlatBread I have to say is hands down the best alternative to pizza, I will never fill guilty again! Not to mention blows  fast pizza out of the water.

There is a great assortment of salads, sandwiches and entrees.  The wine and cocktail list is on point.  I was happy to see the place was packed on a Saturday at 2.  Most places have started to die down.  I had been there when they first opened and they were sparse.

Service was a bit too friendly, I know are server was just trying to do his job to I got respect, Ask for Cole, he will pay attention to you and seems to know the menu.  

I think the restaurant is a new start to a food trend I can't wait to see.  Having focused on my loosing weight and being a foodie, the two don't really go hand and hand - This is a great way to enjoy a night out, without feeling like you wasted the time you spent at the gym.

The flavors are all there and with a changing menu it offers an opportunity not to have the same thing twice.  I would really like to try dinner as I have only been there during lunch.  This will become an easy default place to go to in the area.

Bonus:  They offer black napkins, I think a lot of places over look this

Factoid:  Great place for big parties and they have oddly perfectly set tables.  There wine glasses are the correct ones and there seems to be an attention to detail."}
{"text":"Seasons 52 has a secret vegan menu! It's not particularly extensive, but at least they're aware that vegans are, in fact, not just the stuff of legend. They offer choices like ponzu-glazed tofu, cranberry almond tabouli, and farmer's market-esque vegetable penne. Go you, Seasons 52, go you. 

On an unrelated-but-equally-positive note, Michael was the best waiter known to man (honestly, i usually don't even notice restaurant staff), and I'd like to thank him for helping my boyfriend ask me to prom via a shot glass of rocky road cake. High fives all around."}
{"text":"So just left seasons and it's been a while since I've been there I have to say that there is service has completely changed and I feel like service used to be a little bit more better today I am the hostesses didn't look like they wanted to be there they just seemed mad however they sat us directly because the restaurant was pretty much empty.  Maureen was really sweet she gave her some time and I ordered the green beans  and the cauliflower and significant other ordered the lamb however I got beats  which is OK but I really wanted the green beans I didn't feel like taking them back the kitchen because I think she could not hear me clearly. Had a glass of Pinot Grigio and for dessert we had at the cheesecake it was delicious

Would I go back- I really don't know?- maybe one more time to try the green beans! I'm a vegan vegetarian and the options are not the best! However my date enjoyed th me lamb!"}
{"text":"Had dinner on July 29.  Service was very good.  Had their mushrooms stuffed with crab and shrimp appetizer to start - excellent. My entree' - the scallops were prepared perfectly."}
{"text":"Great service great food! V-Day my Husband and i showed up @ 8pm sharp just to be told i dint have a reservation. When i booked the reservation way back on the 1st of Feb. called back on the 4th of Feb to change it to a party of 4 being we were going to double date. manager at the front told me she could not find my reso and that she had a 30min wait. I we were sat sooner then that but losing my reso then being told i had to wait 30mins to be seated dint impressed us"}
{"text":"Very warm and cozy place to eat. Everything was decorated. The menu is unique, it's seasonal, and they try to use fresh local ingredients. I love. Therefore, we will definitely go there."}
{"text":"My older son was here in Phoenix  for spring break/hiking and I came out to join him for a few days. We were looking for a quick dinner, and chose Seasons52...a GREAT experience....the appetizers especially the crab, stuffed mushrooms, grilled salmon were beyond delicious. Beyond the delicious and generously sized portions, what really made this restaurant enjoyable was the staff: We thought we were dressed too casually and the witty hostess put us at ease...the manager was friendly, but our server Bethany W. was outstanding..she was knowledgeable about the menu, helpful, attentive, not to mention a great conversationalist, warm personality and beautiful! We love coming out to Phoenix for the hiking and activities and will make Seasons52 a repeat if only to see Bethany again!"}
{"text":"It took a bit too long to get the attention of a server but once we had one it was perfection! Great concept of beautifully plated healthy food!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful place, customer service is on the top, food is really good quality, but portions kind of small, pricey!!!!! Good for some special occasion i think!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had \"mom\" visiting this week from back east and chose Seasons 52 for a nice diner out.  Chose to sit in a booth by the bar to enjoy the piano music which mom enjoyed.  The food was simply amazing.  Our waitress helped us with deciding between options and didn't steer us wrong.  This was the second time my wife and I dined here and found great vegetarian options for her."}
{"text":"The food was amazing here and it had a nice atmosphere. The only reason I docked stars was the service was extremely slow and they did not seem very enthusiastic about their job. If you pay for the experience and great food, you should also get great service with it!"}
{"text":"It is really good. Love the fresh local ingredients and changing menu. I also love the that you know how many calories (more or less) that you are eating. The food is delicious. You won't be disappointed. It has good ambiance. I would recommend their great  tasting flatbreads. Staff is great and they take reservations!"}
{"text":"Double-dog dare you to ask for a side of ranch.

You won't find a fryer in the house either. But what you will find is that every dish is under 475 calories - & every dish, delish!  Well, I'm generalizing because we DID only have two dishes, but if the chefs can make a salad taste THAT good, why, what will they be able to do with meat!? I'll find out sooner than later. 

We'd only stopped in for a mid-afternoon snack on a Wednesday - the decor reminds me a bit of \"Frank & Albert's\" - warm, clean lines and inviting. Our service was spot-on. Everyone was professional and friendly. Many yummy dishes on the menu - I wished I was hungrier! (The menu changes weekly, so I didn't get too attached to any one item!)  Mini, adorable desserts were tempting-looking and only $2.50 each. Seasons 52 also has an extensive wine list and a roomy bar area. There's even a piano behind the bar; I did not see a tv in the house. 

Let's see: No tv, no ranch. no fryer. Tasty low calories at reasonable prices, with great service in an upscale cozy setting. The place even made me abandon my \"butter mantra\" for a couple of hours. The reinvention of dining out!?"}
{"text":"Interesting experience..
Although they massively screwed up our order, I must say that there attention to error and how they handled it was rather exceptional. On top of that, the food was fantastic. Sea bass, salmon salad and goat cheese flat bread all absolutely delicious. Also, not a bad old fashioned! Definitely returning...while I will be suspect on the service (no repeats) I appreciate the attention and delicious menu/food"}
{"text":"My husband and I were really impressed with this place! I love that they continuously change their menu around what vegetables are in season! Everything was fresh and all the menu items were unique. This was not a run-of-the-mill restaurant where everything is fried and brown. Plates were colorful and different! You must try the pecan pie shooter after your meal! It was so, so good with my foamy cappuccino!"}
{"text":"The husband and I went here because we had a couple coupons for a free wine flight, glass of wine, and flatbread...who can say no to that? The concept is good, healthy food that is fresh and low cal. The service was also very good. The wine flight had generous tastes of each wine (with the mini glasses taken over in a glass holding device...pretty cool stuff) and each glass had the name and description of the wine. That part of the experience was good. The flatbreads, however, just were nothing too special. The husband got the pesto chicken and I got the goat cheese and artichoke. Both were just kind of bland....they were much better with red chili flakes. It isn't something that I would come back for. Now, I know it's hard to judge a restaurant on a couple of flat breads, so if I were invited here by a friend or something, I would give it another shot, as I do like the concept, but I don't think I would return on my own."}
{"text":"Love @ Seasons 52!  We met friends for dinner and this was their first time dining here!  They are now hooked.  We all enjoyed the Spring 3 Course Dinner-a great value for less than $30.  Filet was the choice for all of us-as you can't beat the bang for the buck.  All steaks were perfectly cooked and tender and accompanied with mashed and crisp asparagus.  I adored my Kale Caesar - garlicky and creamy!  MMMMMM! The petite desserts were just the right amount of sweet to satisfy our savory meal."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience at this restaurant! I never get to eat out because of health problems and I went out on a limb and tried this restaurant. The staff was so kind and accommodating in working with me and the food was great. The cook had friends with similar conditions and I was so grateful to be able to eat out for a change."}
{"text":"Not too shabby!! Food was excellent. Service was superb!! I had the spinach salad and the chicken chili!! It was so good. My hubby had the corn soup and salmon salad. He said it was great. He's not a huge salmon fan and the waiter recommend it. And he did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Good food. Excellent service and ambiance. Pecan pie dessert is awesome. It is like a pecan pie parfait. Oh so good!"}
{"text":"Ambience was intimate.  Had the seabass over risotto.  Good taste but the seabass was a bit dry.  Also tried the turkey burger and the turkey was also bit dry.  

All the stars are given to the dessert.  Unique and simple delicious.  Great presentation.  Tried the blueberry cheesecake, red velvet cake, key lime pie, and lemon moose.  All were amazing and the size was just right."}
{"text":"This chain does a good job of having a very consistent feel no matter what location you go to. This particular Seasons 52 has complementary valet. A live pianist in the bar area made for a very good atmosphere. I recommend getting a reservation, it can get pretty busy. The entire bar area, including booths, was open seating so we were able to get in without having a reservation. I had the Blackened Mahi Mahi and it was excellent. Everything tasted fresh and seasoned very well. The shot glass sized desserts are just the right size to satisfy a sweet tooth after the meal and there are a lot of different choices so everyone will find something they like."}
{"text":"Amazing wait staff, and the great interior almost makes you forget that you are in a fancy strip mall. We were celebrating an anniversary, so the chef came out and personally gave us a little ladle of fresh caprese salad. 

The flatbreads are a must, and the draft beer selection is surprisingly decent. I had the Shrimp and Grits (surprisingly good for a nice place like this), and the wife had the roasted chicken. Both were generous, under 20 bucks, and incredibly flavorful.

I didn't expect to be full and happy at such a well appointed restaurant, but the overall mood is casual enough to put someone like me at ease, while being nice enough for an impressive date night. That is a rare combo, and deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place when the loud and obnoxious suits and polos drinking martinis decide to be silent.  Great service from Corbin for he likes to be himself.  He is not robot but very professional.  Ask for him when you visit.  Love the food and sin on the lower calorie desserts."}
{"text":"Everything that was ordered was delicious. We had pepperoni flatbread that was amazing. And a lobster past dish that was worth it. Everything was reasonably priced considering the quality and the dish. Service and atmosphere is were this restaurant suffered. Service was too chaty amongst them selves, and not paying attention because it looked to be a slow Sat night."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at Seasons 52. The service is always amazing and so is the food. One of my favorite places to eat Salmon."}
{"text":"Wow!! Had a great lunch here! Service and food was fantastic! Pesto board and my Asian/noodle salad was fantastic"}
{"text":"I take clients for work here all the time and have never been disappointed! Everything on the menu is 475 calories or less for the healthy eater, they have a gluten free menu for the gluten free dieters or those allergic (like myself) and they always have great seasonal specials. My favorite part is their menu changes every few months to include the freshest ingredients and they have standard options that are on the menu all year round. The ambiance is a bit stuffy but the staff are always helpful and friendly; the decor just needs to be a little less serious to fit the warm and friendly people and food. Some of my and my friends' favorites are: the Mesquite Grilled Garlic Shrimp, the Caramelized Sea Scallops, the Oak Grilled Filet, the Sonoma Cheese Ravioli and the Greek Salad!
Highly recommend this place :)
Good wine selection too"}
{"text":"So great!!!!  We went for the first time a week ago.  I appreciate their healthy approach to food.  We had the artichoke goat cheese flatbread.  So great!  My husband ordered the NY Strip off the set menu.  It was perfectly cooked, tender and tasty.  I ordered the sea bass.  It was soooo good!  Absolutely delicious!!!  Great service, nice atmosphere, and delicious healthy food.  I have found a new wonderful restaurant!"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing dinner here tonight w good friends! This place is Yummy!! All dishes are prepared with less than 475 calories but you'd never know it by the flavors. They don't use any oils in their preparation. We enjoyed the house specialty of cedar planked salmon, kale ceasar salad, and our friends had Arctic char w salads. Very nice inside, rich woods, patio seating as well.  Extensive wine list with at least 40 wines by the glass. Piano music at the large bar area added to our enjoyment! Our waiter, who was excellent asked if we wherever\"first timers\" and brought out desserts on the house for us. The name \"seasons 52\" represents that they change the menu every week..this was an excellent choice for us tonight and we are looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"I am so happy I discovered Seasons 52! My honey and I went here to enjoy the restaurant week menu, and, wow, was it a treat! It's easy to find good in the valley, but it's a bit harder to find good restaurants that are great for health-conscious individuals or diners with special food needs (lactose-free, vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free). The wine list is long and varied, which was a little intimidating at first, but our server was helpful in offering suggestions and sample tastes to make sure we were happy with our selections. 

I have to mention that despite the rolling menus of seasonal dishes, almost every dish has nutrition info posted online (and available in calorie trackers like myfitnesspal). This makes meal planning and decision-making beyond easy. 

At $30 per person, the restaurant week menu provided more food and higher quality options than many of the restaurants at the higher price points. Much of the special menu was selected from the standard autumn menu, so even returning to order from the normal menu, you would find similar or same options. 

Included was a shared roasted tomato flatbread, and a salad, entrée, and dessert each. The flatbread was crispy, tangy, and wonderful, and the salads were fresh and interesting. But the main course was the highlight. Both of us ordered the filet mignon (medium), and it was perfection from plating to palate. The flavors of the mashed potatoes (great texture with skin still included), broccolini, and mushrooms complemented the filet well, but the red wine sauce brought everything together and tied it up nicely with a little bow. Because no meal feels complete without something sweet at the end, the dessert shooters are a must: small in size but big in flavor and very satisfying with an espresso or coffee to go with. The perfect end to an thoroughly enjoyable meal. 

So good that we are thinking of going again before the week is over!"}
{"text":"I met a group of 12 for breakfast.  I came about mid arrival. Half the table had received beverages.  A few more stragled out as the rest of the party arrived... and received beverages... myself and the person next to me were still drinkless... as orders began to be taken, I gained our wait staff's attention and told him what I and my seat partner wanted and that I was also without flatware.  The drinks snd utinsils came in short time.  Our orders began to arrive, a few bits of confusion with some, mine had to be sent back and returned still not quite right but not so bad I needed to wait again.  The food was very tasty and only one person in our group was truely disappointed but the staff displayed a great need to be trained for a group.  Either that, or he stayed out too late the night before.  It's a beautiful place and when they turned the music down and we could chat without screaming, a plus these days.  The cost can be off-putting for most.  My breakfast was a little less than $30."}
{"text":"We eat here regularly and I have now hosted about 4 large business dinners (15-25 people) as well as a private event (40 people) here.  I've also dined in small groups.  

Good: The food is pretty good.  It's healthier than most other restaurants - so if you want healthy cooking, this is about as good as it gets.  The service in the dining room is very attentive and friendly as well. I also love the live piano in the bar!

Bad: Events - it's hard to coordinate private events here.  They have someone in charge of events, but I think he's overwhelmed because I really struggled to get responses and continued to run into miscommunications with their events dept.  He seems VERY nice, but clearly overwhelmed.

I continue going back here because it's the best option for HEALTHY high-end dining... and that's important to most people.  And the dining room staff are always amazing.  But i would hesitate to host another private event here."}
{"text":"To start off - our server could not have been more friendly. She was awesome!

For food I ordered the lump crab wedge salad (half size) and the duck flatbread.  The duck flatbread was modeled after peking duck you would order at a Chinese restaurant with the Peking sauce and the green onions.  I would have enjoyed the dish more if the chunks of duck had been more noticeable (didn't really taste them) and if the flatbread had been a little less crispy (burnt at the edges).

The crab salad was tasty.  I felt the dressing was a bit too sour and would have actually enjoyed like a creamy blue cheese dressing, but of course, that probably would not have fit in with the restaurant's goal of having every dish under 400 calories.

I think I've come to realize that I'm one of those people that enjoys (when I eat out) big chunks of fatty meat, stuff cooked in butter, cream sauces, so for that reason this restaurant isn't my #1 favorite. but for others who are more health-concious I can see this as being an excellent choice!

FYI: they have a separate vegetarian menu, so make sure you ask for that if you are a vegetarian.

also, I must be getting old bc the lighting in here was SO DIM it was difficult to read the menu. I had to put my face super up close to the menu to read it and it was straining my eyes. we eventually had to pull out our phones to use as lights."}
{"text":"Came here as part of an interview this fall and loved this place. It's located inside of a strip mall, but that shouldn't fool you as to the quality. Plenty of parking and a very nice ambiance.

We got drinks (definitely recommend the old-fashioned - comes with a rock candy stirring stick which I thought was just pretty cool) and a mix of the flatbreads which were all great. For dinner I had the Wood-Grilled Pork Tenderloin, which was perfectly cooked and had phenomenal flavor. For dessert they bring out a variety of cake shots - I can only speak for the key lime pie but from what I heard from the others, you couldn't go wrong there."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with a visit to Seasons 52 during Arizona Restaurant Week while we were unpacking into our new condo, and we had a great experience.  Service was on-the-ball, the pianist was fun, and the food was great.  We shared a few drinks and ate off the $30 four course meal restaurant week menu.

Roasted Roma Tomato Flatbread: This was large and very filling, but that's about all I can say about it.  The tomatoes tasted fresh, but I honestly couldn't tell the difference between this flatbread and cheaper flatbread sold at less-fancy restaurants.

Sonoma Goat Cheese Ravioli: Each bite is creamy goodness.  My husband and I were arguing over whose dish was better (my ravioli versus his caprese) and it ended up being a super close call.  I could have eaten multiple of these dishes as my main course (as every course, in fact) and been satisfied.

Warm Roasted Tomato Caprese: The tomatoes tasted incredibly fresh and literally melted in your mouth, and the vinegar dressing tasted like those $40 fancy vinegars that you sample in the Napa Valley stores.  This was probably the best dish we had.

Oak-Grilled Fillet Mignon: Exquisitely tender - another dish that just seemed to melt in your mouth.

Wood-Roasted Pork Tenderloin: I think meats must be some chef's specialty, since this was the best pork I've had.

Dessert: the tray of \"Mini Indulgences\" was brought around, and we selected the coffee-flavored one (to die for) and a tangy lemon one that contrasted well with our chocolatey coffee selection.  I'd choose the coffee one again but would try a different flavor for the second.

Drinks:  We tried the recommended Strawberry Martini, which was surprisingly large (they leave the shaker with you so you can keep the remaining drink iced) and incredibly fresh. Apparently the liquor had been soaking in fresh strawberries all day.  My husband tried the Ginger Mule, which was as odd as it sounds but was served in a tin cup, which was fun.  We were a little disappointed in the Chocolate Martini, which was a little too syrupy for my tastes.  It tasted a little like that chocolate wine you can buy in a bottle at the grocery store.

Overall, we had a fantastic time.  A couple of dishes weren't worth the high price in my mind (the flatbread and chocolate martini, namely), but if you select wisely, the majority of the dishes were spectacular."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  It is great for business meals, lunch, dinner, and especially for events - private dining rooms.  And on birthdays!  The food is incredible and reasonably priced, the service is top-notch and the dining room is always clean and quiet.  The most amazing mini desserts on the planet!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, and great service from Matt. We had to wait a moment, less than 5 minutes, before being seated for lunch at approximately 11:30. The lobster flatbread was well-cooked and balanced in flavors, and my guest's duck looked quite good. The wine selection is excellent."}
{"text":"Amazing as always.

Seasons 52 is one of my favorite restaurants and everything is delicious.  The standout at this location is the service...phenomenal.

Long time loyal customer."}
{"text":"Lunch time at Seasons 52 right before the staff changed over to dinner. Normally you may see a lag in service but not here. Great food and wonderful service. Greeter gave us a dinner menu when we were there for a late lunch but the server did provide the lunch menu when asked. Overal Quality with a capital Q. Pricey but worthy it. Validated parking as well."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for Thanksgiving, had a 3:45pm reservation, was given a standard pager instead. Very crowded poeple standing all over the place waiting to be seated. Almost an hour later i am complaining to my Father, the check-in staff hears me and asks for my pager number. Turns out their reservation system moved up to 6:00pm and did not notify. So we finally get seated after they fix the error.

The table service was good, the food was excellent. But Management here leaves much to be desired.

While I was getting our table straight, my GF was talking to a clueless Manager that had no idea they had seating issues.

We were not the only party seated almost an hour late. We talked with several other parties that also found out that a reservation just means you are invited to hold a pager and wait. 

The couple in line before us at check in, however, Had eaten and were leaving just as we were seated. Again my only complaint is that Management has no clue how to run a restraunt. 

Won't be going back, as service is part of the overall package."}
{"text":"Walking into this place I have the say the atmosphere caught my attention right off the bat. It was chill and very relaxing. We quickly got seated and the host quickly got us taken care of with some drinks (I drink water). We ordered the Cider-glazed grilled chicken skewers as a appetizer and personally I didn't understand the flavors. It was all over the place to me. My wife and inlaws liked it very much.

For dinner I ordered a cup of Chili and Boneless Beef short rib. After tasting the chicken I was a bit nervous of the flavors. I got the soup first and it was delicious, I dumped a bunch of tobacco sauce in it since I like my chili spicy. The Boneless Short rib was AMAZING! It was tender, juicy and had so much deliciousness in it. I got mashed potatos and asparagus with it and ahhh I was in heaven. I devoured it in 5 min! For dessert I had the smallest tiniest glass of Peanut Butter Torte. It was again delicious, however I could have really gone for a bowl full of it. 

I understand this is a healthy restaurant and I can honestly say I eat pretty well and am pretty damn fit. As I got my meal and devoured it I thought I myself \"im gonna need to stop by jack in the box on the way home\". The portions are pretty damn small especially with the cost of them. I could have honestly eaten 2 short rib orders and been happy as a clam. The dessert was again was just so tiny, I think they give you the tine spoon to make you feel like your getting plenty. 

The service overall was very quick and helpful.

Personally, I'm not really into the expensive, fancy restaurants. If I have a option between
1.) Seasons 52 Boneless Beef short rib or 
2.) bacon cheeseburger and a beer
If I had to choose I would have gone with number 2. It was a great experience and the flavors on the meal were really good. However for the price and the portions, im not a fan."}
{"text":"This place is my NEW FAVORITE place to dine in Phoenix. The food is delicious and guilt-free. The staff at Seasons 52 guarantee that every meal is under 500 Calories... I'm sold!

The whole menu changes four times per year... with the seasons... ;) and there is a side menu that changes every week.... hence the \"52.\" 

I had scallops with asparagus. They were perfectly cooked and I knew I could eat the whole meal without reservation because it was within my daily caloric intake :) But then again we had to get an appetizer (their cheese breads are like flat pizzas) and dessert!

This is now THE place I recommend to out of town guests and to the boyfriend for date night."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice and twice we have been disappointed.  The food is just so-so, nothing very creative.  I must say the individual desserts were the best thing we've had on the menu.   Probably won't be back.  I'd rather head down the mall and eat at True Foods instead."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this restaurant is slightly confusing to me.

For one, the restaurant looks like it should be a traditional steakhouse.  Its rich woods and the general feel of the restaurant are more classic than nouveau.  The menu does not seem to jive with the ambience.  It is also in need of some fabric updating, as the fabric on the chairs/booths looks like it could be from a Carrow's or similar establishment... when everything else appears high end.

The bar is SPECTACULAR.  This is a bar I would come to often, if I lived nearby.  There is a pianist in the center and the bar is sort of an island.  There are also booths in the bar area.  It is reminiscent of a cruise ship bar.  Very cool.  They have a pretty well-rounded wine list and I got to try a French red that I can't recall (but that I really enjoyed).  

The food is great... especially with every dish being under 475 calories.  It might be under seasoned for some people, but I don't salt anything at home so it was perfect for me.  I started with one of the goat cheese ravioli - delicious.  I also ordered the ahi tuna salad.  The ahi salad was served in a cylinder and was poured onto the plate in front of me.  It was very cool and I have never seen that kind of flair in a salad presentation (maybe I am sheltered).  The ahi was melt-in-your-mouth good.  And even though I had to share a few bites of tuna, I was still full after my salad.  COMPLETELY full.  Of course, I still had to try the mini indulgences.  I got to try both a chocolate peanut butter mousse (extremely rich) and the carrot cake (absolutely my favorite).  The few bites of mini indulgences definitely doubled my caloric intake for the night.  Still, they were worth it.

I would say that overall this is a 4.5* restaurant for food and ambience.  I am giving it the extra 1/2 star because the service was impeccable.  

I would love to have a get together in the bar for drinks here sometime.  And I will definitely be back for the food!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and each visit has been top notch with the service, food and total experience.

Came here tonight for my daughter's 16th Birthday which she chose.

We ordered the Grilled Garlic Pesto Chicken Flatbread and the Cedar Plank Roasted Salmon.

The Flatbread is a great way to start your meal which is lite but very tasty.

The cedar plank salmon is probably the best prepared salmon that I have ever had which comes with potatoes, asparagus, carrots and other veggies.

The cedar gives the salmon a great smoked flavor which does not need any sauce at all.

The service at the beginning was non existent and then our waiter Matt apologized and took care of us.

The one thing is the atmosphere is great but it is so dark that you could barely see the menu.

Very nice place to have special occasions or just a nice dinner.

The portions are not large so don't expect to get alot of food.

Quality wins over quantity here."}
{"text":"This has become one of our favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area. We enjoyed our anniversary meal so much on Aug 29th (summer menu) that we came back the next week for my husband's birthday on Sep 3rd and enjoyed the new fall menu.

We had first tried Seasons a few years ago and sat at the bar and really enjoyed the live piano music, so we were a little disappointed to discover that the piano had been removed. Our waiter said it was so the restaurant would be a bit quieter for diners who preferred conversation.

The atmosphere is still very attractive and the background music is just right. My husband who is passionate about health and fitness is mostly a \"whole food vegan\" and I'm mostly vegetarian, so we greatly appreciated the seasonally changing menu with many vegetarian options. Having the calories listed by the items is also extremely helpful in planning our selections. 

The heirloom tomatoes with watermelon and the heirloom tomatoes with the melted cheese were both outstanding. You can't get tomatoes like that in a grocery store! Also outstanding were the squash soup, mushrooms appetizer and flatbreads. I had the vegetarian entree during our summer visit and my favorite items were the taco and the quinoa salad. My husband had the salmon on that visit, but it was too dry for him. On our next visit during the fall menu he tried the vegetarian entrée and really enjoyed it. I had the heirloom tomatoes with melted cheese as my main dish and it was outstanding and just the right amount after having the mushroom appetizer.

The desserts are delicious small portions of mouses and cake bites. As I eat healthier my tastes are changing and I actually don't want such a rich dessert. I think I would prefer a scoop of coffee gelato or fruit with granola topping.

 It will be fun to visit again in another season."}
