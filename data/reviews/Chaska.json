{"text":"Chaska is seriously very good. The previous review that says that the food is like homemade is dead on; everything is really fresh and not insanely salty. 

It's also cheap and the owners are friendly. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place is quite good.  I picked up some naan and a few vegetable dishes and was satisfied with everything.  They have quite a few frozen items such as somosas and desserts that I am eager to try.  
Finally, somewhere to get an indian meal for one!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had the lamb curry, butter chicken, and brown rice.  The butter chicken was decent; nothing mind-blowing.  In the lamb curry, the curry itself was delicious, but the lamb meat definitely could have been better.  It still had the bones attached to it and with plastic cutlery, it is very difficult to separate bone and meat.  Additionally, the meat itself had too many tendons and was almost impossible to chew - even when I cut it into very small pieces.

The price for the food is excellent, though.  The owner was also there and he was extremely friendly and helpful.  I didn't mention that I wanted my food spicier until the end (mea culpa), at which point he brought out some amazing garlic spicy sauce (ask for this at the beginning).  The place has art, photography, and happy pastel colors everywhere.  I recommend it."}
{"text":"Oh. Wow.

This is like actual food. Not restaurant food, oversalted and overcooked and lukewarm under the heat lamps. This is homecooked food. I can actually taste the peas and paneer. Most Indian restaurants oversalt and overseason to the point where you can't taste the food. 

This is just awesome. Four stars for now, just for the quality of the food. (Prices are good too, $7 and change for a very substantial 'small' curry on rice.) There may be more stars later as I try more stuff there.

Practical stuff: there are no stairs to get in but the door is a bit narrow. Folks with wheels can probably get in, although I wouldn't be too sure about big scooters. The menu items are marked if they're V (vegan) or GF (gluten-free). There's very little seating inside but they do large orders for business lunches. Debit, Visa, and Mastercard are accepted as well as cash."}
