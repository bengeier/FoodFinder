{"text":"Good place to grab a quick bite if your in southpointe. I call this a typical \"Pittsburgh\" pizza, nothing to write home about,  but not bad either. The grilled chicken salad is good and the price is right."}
{"text":"I love Vincent's! My co workers and I order from Vincent's quite often, and it never disappoints. Delivery is quick and the food is always fresh. I've also eaten at the restaurant a few times as well, which is decent. They always have daily specials and I enjoy the wedding soup and we'll and their chocolate chip cookies! There is plenty of parking and it's easy to get to if you work in southpointe or anywhere in the Canonsburg area. My go to is their cheesesteak sandwich. I LOVE this sandwich. It's not your standard phili cheesesteak with yellow cheese peppers or onions but instead has lettuce, tomato, provolone & their house dressing. I am a big fan of the house dressing! I also like the pepper steak salad & someone in my office claims the meatball sub is the best ever, but I've never tried that. They offer catering as well. Vincent's is a little on the pricy side, but I would recommend it since the food is great."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday.  The place was packed with a bus load of what appeared to be high school kids and their teachers (they left in a school bus).  Service was very slow with only one waitress and the cook(?) running food orders.  I ordered a cheese steak with fried onions, ketchup and pickles and was served a cheese steak with tomatoes what appeared to be a salad with oil and vinegar.  They definitely missed the mark on that one.

I'll try them one more time as I'm working nearby but another experience like my first and I'm out."}
{"text":"Use often for delivery and food is always great and quick! Very nice staff. Salads and pizzas are all good. I use the Vincent's southpointe most often."}
{"text":"Good service and food! Love the chicken dumpling soup!"}
{"text":"Horrible food! First of all, the portion size is pitiful and the food is not that great at all. I ordered Amy's Alfredo with a side salad and garlic rolls. There is hardly n e sauce on the noodles and u can't even taste the cheese sauce, it tastes like buttered noodles. The store bought Alfredo is a lot better then this. The side salad was a basic salad, but my garlic rolls were small, my son's meatball was bigger then my 2 tiny rolls. My husband ordered a buffalo chicken sub with fries. The sandwich was about 8 inches, more bun then chicken, and it was just plain. We ordered two kids meals, grilled cheese with fries and penne pasta with meatballs. The grilled cheese was grilled on a bun and came with 6 fries. The pasta hardly had any sauce, looked like red tinted noodles, but it did come with 1 huge meatball.  We will never order from there again, and its sad because it's the second closest restaurant that we live by."}
{"text":"Thin pizza was pretty tasty . Delivery was fast and courteous. Problem was the price seemed very high. $21.35 for a large (standard large size at any pizzeria) with pepperoni and sausage. Just seems pricey."}
{"text":"We dined in. The food was good, but the service was very, very slow.

While the servers were friendly, they need to either add additional staff or augment what's going on in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Good pizza place. Reasonable pricing. Prefer the original in greentree but will still order the pasta mafaldo or Buffalo chicken pizza anytime."}
{"text":"Updating my review as I just had a meatball sub and it is delicious. I even appreciate that they cut the meatballs for easier consumption.  This is the best meatball sub I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"The base sauces are really bland.  So the food is as well.  Salads are the best.  Service is good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get pizza in the area. My usual is the buffalo chicken pizza. I've never been disappointed by their quality. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that their hours are limited Sat-Mon, which are my preferred times to order from them."}
