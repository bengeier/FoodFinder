{"text":"Time to update this review! My other one was from when Everest Kitchen was still on 17th Ave... and it definitely isn't anymore!  I desperately miss this place, after moving out-of-province! At least once a month my mum and I came here for the lunch buffet. Always the best of service and the greatest food. Personally, I am THE anti-buffet (it's the cleanliness and turnover factors that repel me). I have never had qualms with eating here; never had to force myself not to think about it, as at other, run-down places. A very well-run restaurant.  I also came here for a company party last March, and the dinner was fantastic. The portions are great for sharing! I don't think there was anyone who didn't enjoy their meal thoroughly.  A hidden (or maybe not so much now) gem!"}
{"text":"I've experienced this place for dinner, takeout and the lunch buffet.  The first time I visited Everest Kitchen (after being spoken pretty highly about by my partner) I was really impressed.  The manager, Dwarika Karki is really awesome and I thought service was excellent (it is a one man show at the front of the restaurant).  Food was divine.  Nepalese food is similar to East Indian food but they definitely use different spices.  One of the dishes that caught our eye was yak!  We had a yak appetizer and it was done really well.  How did it taste?  Guess you'll have to try it out!  For those who are afraid of it being gamey or really tough, it is not either of those at all.  We tried the Tarkari and Chatpat dishes for dinner and both were awesome.    Take out was equally as good.  The portion sizes are a little smaller than I'm used to but one dish each plus rice and some naan would be enough to feed the average person.    I finally returned for the lunch buffet and there were about 6-8 dishes including rice and dessert to choose from.  I loved the Butter Chicken but best of all was the fresh naan bread that was served.  I was pleasantly surprised when it was brought to the table as you don't usually get fresh naan with a lunch buffet.  Just the naan with some butter chicken and that would be wonderful for me!  It's always a really quiet place when I've been there but this is an awesome place, great food, great service!"}
{"text":"Before I came here I had no idea what Nepalese cuisine was like. I left wanting to learn more. We had the Chicken Sekuwa and the Mixed Grill with some garlic flat bread. The Chicken Sekuwa consisted of about 6 strips of chicken treated in Nepalese spices.  The Mixed Grill was a hodge-podge of meats consisting of Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Sekuwa, Lamb Sekuwa, Himalayan Kebab and Shrimp. Both were cooked in their clay oven and were delicious.  I found myself introduced me to flavours I never experienced before, especially the Himalayan Kabob. It was a bit gamy, but I love game meat. The server suggested that we get something \"saucy\" as well for our meal, but we chose not to.  I kind of understood what he meant as it would of been nice to dip the bread and meat in some sauce. The portions are smaller and it isn't the cheapest place (per portion size), but I think worth the price because of its uniqueness. I will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. The food is very flavorful and delicious. The service is quick and very friendly. Want to try something different and get great service and satisfy your taste buds everest kitchen is it. The ambiance is cozy, unique and feel like you are in Nepal. There lunch and Sunday buffet is fresh and delicious. You won't go home hungry."}
{"text":"A small hole-in-the-wall place. Don't be fooled by the outside! First, be aware that they are only open until 9pm (not 10pm as listed on Yelp). We got there just a few minutes before closing on a cold Thursday evening and it was empty. Too bad, because the food and the service are very good. If you like hotter spicing, be sure to say something, since I think that they assume mild unless you speak up. We had one  chicken dish in a tomato based sauce and a skewered lamb dish. Even without the heat, the taste was great and the meat was extremely tender. The flat bread is fluffy and very fresh."}
