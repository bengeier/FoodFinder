{"text":"I've driven by this place a few times but never knew what it was. Myself and two girls came for HH. The server seemed hesitant to give up the HH menu. We wanted to try a new place and heard that the chef was from Pizzaria Bianco (not confirmed). We split the charcuterie board that had two cheeses and two meats with grapes and nuts. My friends enjoyed the olive oil. We each had personal pizzas on the HH menu that were only $8 for one topping. The pizza was pretty good but not memorable. Came on a HUGE plate bough so it just seemed odd. Split the farmers market said which was the same grapes and nuts on the charturterie board. Ambiance wasn't what we expected. A large room that did fill up for HH but didn't seem like a wine/pizza spot. They seemed to care more about the beers. Just seemed a little mismatched. Our sever didn't really seem to care about three girls ordering HH. Our plate was dirty and no menus. I think the back patio might be a  good date night when it gets cooler. 

Overall we weren't impressed. If you want good pizza and a welcoming atmosphere go two businesses down and go to Grazie!!!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ordered the Senza Formaggio, which is labeled vegan and has no cheese. We also started out with the Bistro Bacon salad. I have to say, both were delicious. The bistro bacon is a very simple salad. It had plenty of crispy warm bacon, which went nicely with the vinaigrette. The pizza crust was nice and chewy, which is a requirement for a good crust in my opinion. The sauce was full of flavor. The service we received was also very good.

Why dock a star then? Olives. That's right, you heard me: olives. My girlfriend and I are both big fans of olives. The bistro bacon salad has olives listed as an ingredient. We also ordered olives as an additional ingredient to our pizza. The salad had 2, maybe 3 olives on the entire thing. The pizza was the same story. Not only that, but we've been here twice now and ordered the same thing both times, and both times the olive situation was the same. If I'm paying $3 for olives on my pizza, I expect no skimping. 

This place is great, but until they up their olive game, I probably won't be visiting as often as I otherwise would."}
{"text":"This was a GREAT place to start our AZ vacation.  We arrived for a late lunch on a Wednesday, and found several other couples finishing their lunches.
We chose to have lunch on the back patio (It would be fantastic for parties).  

The service was impeccable.  Our server was very knowledgable about the drafts they were pouring, and helped us select 5 beers based on our explanation of what flavors and other beers we like.

Between the four of us, we ordered 3 pizzas, and a Panzanella salad.  Everything was wonderful.  The caramelized onions on the Fico Pizza were sweet and perfectly went with the Arugala and Fig Sauce.

The ingredients were fresh and delicious.  When we are back in the area, we will be sure to visit again."}
{"text":"We went by Craft 64 yesterday before the Giants spring training game. The atmosphere is great and the staff are very friendly, knowledgeable about the beer and wine selection, and helpful. We shared a pizza and a salad. The pizza was amazing and the perfect size for two people to share with the salad. A nice touch is that the salad ingredients were from a local producer."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch here yesterday and couldn't have been more pleased! Staring with beverages, they had too many craft local beers to mention, and my husband was very happy with what our server suggested. I had a glass of rosé which was also terrific.  Now on to the food.....decided to split a salad and wood fired pizza, and the other Yelp reviews were correct! The salad was the \"market salad\" of the day, which consisted of French fry sized slices of jicama, lovely paper thin slices of beauty heart radishes, shallots, micro greens, and fresh vinaigrette. 
The pizza we selected (the Aji) had a crusty, yet chewy texture, topped with a spicy jalapeño green sauce (no tomato sauce), a judicious amount of mozzarella, ricotta and Parmesan cheese, artisanal locally made fennel sausage, sautéed onions, and finished with fresh spinach.  We were so pleased that the husband said he would go back there during our short visit to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and even greater wine, served at just the right temperature. The patio was awesome.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza in Scottsdale. In my opinion, the best in the U.S. I wanted to write this review as I sat and ate my pizza today, but I refrained to enjoy the atmosphere and great staff. In any case, go try this place, I'd suggest the Aji Pizza or the Margherita Pizza with Prosciutto. Made to perfection every time. I've tried to only come here once a month, but it seems I find myself here every week or two. Keep it up, Craft 64!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time at Craft 64! It is a small, but cozy place with an excellent selection of unique AZ craft beers. Owners were extremely friendly and helpful in selecting beers. The pizzas were delicious and clearly made with fresh ingredients. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went here for gfs bday and was excellent! They have great different variations on Moscow mules that are very tasty. The caprese salad was great with homemade mozzarella, bruschetta with prosciutto and fig was delicious! We had the salad with the bacon and fried egg on it and I'm craving it today. Pizza was great perfect thin crust coal ovens style and very tasty! Looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Very inviting atmosphere, which is the best part of this restaurant.  The sausage pizza I ordered had very little of the fennel sausage raved about by the waiter.  I did enjoy the very thin crust. But there wasn't much flavor at all. I ordered the flourless chocolate cake that was served right out of the freezer. When I mentioned it to the owner he said they had thought about putting them in the oven, but didn't offer me the courtesy of making my order edible.  This is not a restaurant I would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Ah-mazing!!! THE best pizza EVERrrr! The Fico pizza is delicious, yum yum yum. Then for desert the Nutella Indulgence! To die for! OMGee!"}
{"text":"Love this place - came in mid-afternoon (2-ish).  Immediate, attentive service, and casual atmosphere.  Terrific selection of AZ craft!  Try the pils, try the saison, try them all!

Kale salad with seasonal fruit (pear for me), was stellar.  Margarita pizza was spot on.  According to my server, almost everything is local, all scratch made, and the mozzarella was built earlier in the day.  It shows.

Rumor has it this place packs out, but mid-afternoon it's chill.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of my favourite establishments in The Valley.  Excellent pizza and beer, all of which is brewed in the great state of Arizona.  Service has always been fast and friendly, and happy hour is every day 4-7.  Only complaint is that the pizza is a little on the expensive side at $14-$20 each, but if you split between two people it's not too bad."}
{"text":"Had dinner and drinks at Craft 64 last night. Staff/owners are very cool and helpful. Fresh mozzarella in Caprese Salad was amazing. Pizza crust was fabulous. 

Glad they are in Old Town."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great wine and craft beer.  Dynamic and knowledgeable staff. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Incredibly great pizza... Wonderful sauce and superb crust.. And we r picky pizza people from Chicago. Very reasonable prices... Husband enjoyed sampling local craft beers and ditto for me on the wine. Friendly and attentive server Trish and owner Roger are lovely people who make everyone including out-of -town tourists feel welcome."}
{"text":"We are visiting Scottsdale and decided to try Craft 64 -- what a find. Yummy drinks, beers and wines to choose from. The many beers on tap are all from AZ. Cool fact and tasty brews. Very nice atmosphere and staff. You feel like a regular the first time you visit."}
{"text":"Holy cow what a find! Love this place. Best pizza in city, not kidding! It buries Grazie, and Bianco! Service was amazing! Staff took time to answer all my questions and recommended some amazing beers that I normally would never had tried. Great atmosphere and the patio is super cool! Will definitely be back and bringing friends. Again pizza is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This place takes pizza and beer to a whole new level! Craft brews from exclusively Arizona breweries and all local food ingredients made in a ACTUAL woodfired oven, done correctly. They usually have unique selections... in some cases the only places you can get certain suds are exclusively at the brewery of origin or Craft 64. I also attended a Wine Pairing Dinner in partnership with Tablas Creek Winery, recently voted #1 winery in America in 2015 and notable for their use of Rhone varietals & organic, sustainable farming techniques. The multi-course meal prepared by the chef was one of the highlight meals of my 3 years so far in Scottsdale and perfectly augmented and enhanced the carefully selected wines. I don't always review all the places I eat and frequent, but when I do, I aim to draw attention to the finest & most authentic experiences I encounter as a diner; Craft 64 provides that in spades, with sincerity and the consistent presence of it's owners. In a nutshell: I F&$KING LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had. Plus 34 beers on tap. It should be caller craft 34. That's my only complaint"}
{"text":"Variety! I loved the various different taps that were available. First time going and I was thoroughly impressed with the options and the food. Everything was very reasonably priced and given how it was a Friday night, I surely thought they would've run out of stuff but nope. Check this cool little place out!"}
{"text":"We just went here to dinner and it was delicious. Not a super extensive menu for food, but what we got was extremely good.  I always love wood fired pizza, and they do it quite well with quality ingredients. We will definitely be coming again!"}
{"text":"What to say about Craft 64. Good beers (smooove hoperator and the wipa snapa: liked the latter better), amazing pizzas (Uovo and Carne) and above and beyond customer service. 

The server brought out the Carne pizza instead of what we ordered (Uovo), so he told us to snack on it (on the house) as they fired the other one up. Man, call it serendipity but we liked the Carne better. That pizza is  a m a z i n g. We're from Los Angeles having had good pizza in New York and Italy (my wife) and we can honestly say that the Carne pizza is something special. Wow. 

Brian Wilson was our server and was enthusiastic and attentive. He's a walking karaoke jukebox. He even signed our pizza box. We will probably save it in our garage forever. 

So far, we are very impressed with the quality of food in Arizona. And Craft 64 represented tonight!"}
{"text":"My friend had heard about Craft 64 during restaurant week so we decided to give it a try for lunch last weekend.  Seriously one of the best meals I have ever had.  Menu is simple featuring salads and pizzas.  We shared the Caprese salad and Carne pizza, the kale salad ordered by the people at the table next to us looked pretty good too so I might have to try that next time. You could taste the freshness of all the ingredients. Oh, they make their own Mozzarella and it's phenomenal. Great food, rotating AZ craft beers on tap, clean and modern restaurant with friendly service = a winning combination. Next time I'm in Scottsdale I will return and bring more friends.  I can't say enough about this place and I wish the owners much success. Cheers!

Update: I've been here a couple times since my first review and it's still consistently delicious. Beer selection is endless and the food and service are excellent. Love this place."}
{"text":"My husband found this place by chance after the Ameri-CAN beer festival in Scottsdale, and what luck!  They have a large selection of local beers on tap, friendly staff, and wonderful food.  I dream about the caprese sandwich.  We would visit way more frequently if it was a little closer to home."}
{"text":"This pizza is fantastic. It is probably the best wood fired pizza in Scottsdale. And as an added bonus, they have 36 local beers on tap. James along with the other owners and servers know their stuff. Tell them what you like and they will hook you up.

There is no freezer on the property. No microwaves or warming lights. The food is all fresh, organic when can be, and they make their own mozzarella in house. Can not recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Awesome hidden gem of a place.  Great local craft beer selection, pizza, salads and sandwiches.  Pretty good wine selection as well.  Staff is awesome and knowledgeable!!! This is a local business well worth supporting."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza and love the staff! Friendly and inviting! Don't leave Scottsdale without trying it or you'll be sorry!

It is also close to hotel Valley Ho- literally 800 feet down the street!"}
{"text":"Craft 64 is great! They are very knowledgeable about all of their beers and are quick to give a suggestion depending on their taste. All of the beer is from Arizona. We are from Florida and were able to try all different kinds of Arizona beers.  (The cucumber beer is amazing!) 

Not only is the beer delicious but oh.em.gee the food!! Everything is SO fresh. The caprese salad is to die for. So is the pizza! My boyfriend and I sat at the bar and everything that came through the window looked so so so good and very fresh. 

If you are in Scottsdale and love good food and good beer, you must go here. It's great.  Thank you, Craft 64 for a great time!"}
{"text":"Ok,  I have been told they will only have AZ beers on tap (36) !! Watching the pizza chef stretching dough makes me wish I was more hungry than thirsty. Very friendly and helpful . A great place to relax and sample some of AZ's finest craft brewers latest creations.  CHEERS!"}
{"text":"Small place with nice casual atmosphere. Patio is great especially since it can get quite loud inside. All the pizzas we have tried have been excellent and a great beer selection of course. They don't have a kids menu but always helpful in getting sides of various items that the little ones will eat. Only a couple parking spots but you can usually find something on the street not too far away."}
{"text":"We chose this place on the suggestion of the concierge at the Valley Ho. We were determined to watch the SJ Sharks in the Stanley Cup. The owners were so friendly and accommodating that we were sold on the place. Then came the food. Everything was outstanding and the house-made mozzarella was off the hook. Plus happy hour from 4-7! We love this place and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Best beer selection, best charcuterie board.  Love it.  Wish i could walk there....but if i could i would gain 40lbs!"}
{"text":"Happy hour olive plate and classic Bruschetta. Food was top notch. Couple of local brewed beers. Great small non-crowded at atmosphere early afternoon/ early happy hour:"}
{"text":"We have been several times. Pizza is great (Spain is my favorite). Salads are also very good. However... The beer selections are outstanding!! Service has been friendly, easygoing, and welcoming. We certainly make this place a weekly visit."}
{"text":"Came with friends while here on business.    The beer and wine lists are phenomenal with lots of local brews. The food is tasty with fresh ingredients.    They even make their own mozzarella...buttery and smooth.    This is a must visit place in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Every time, Craft 62 does not disappoint!! Some of the best pizza in the valley. Fresh mozzarella made in-house. Local AZ beers and wine only. They constantly rotate so you'll always have the opportunity to try something delicious and new. The food is GREAT! My favorite is the Fico pizza or their weekly special pizza. Like I said, they always have something new. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Craft 64 hosted our party tonight.  We started with 9, then 10, then ended with a group of 12 at dinner!  They gave us fantastic service!  Great beer, and great pizza!  I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We really loved the homemade mozzarella. The service was amazing. Super friendly staff. Pizza was great. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now...and I am sure many more future visits are to come!  The pizza is amazing....the toppings, the cheese, the crust...together it is perfect!  I have had the Carne pizza and the special one night which was a white pizza, with fresh figs and prosciutto...I couldn't stop eating it!  The Bistro Bacon salad is also delicious, the bacon dressing really takes it over the top and you can't go wrong with a Nutella and Banana calzone!  

Love the beer selection...including some ciders!

Excellent patio, excellent food, excellent staff...this is a place that you just must check out!"}
{"text":"Pizza. Decent. 
Service. Poor...we hardly ever saw our waitress. We ordered a few pizzas and we were finished with the first 2 by the time the 3rd came out. 
Ambiance. Honestly...we thought it was horrible. (That comment seems dramatic) but it was so loud in there. Not a fun buzz loud that creates a great mood...but a yelling across the table loud. We could not wait to be done and get out of there."}
{"text":"Outstanding Pizza!!!!! Great Selection of Arizona Beers!!!!! Roger the owner was fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Do NOT judge this place from the outside. Enter in and your nose will be immediately happy. Great food, local, hand made. Incredible wine selection with great pricing. All local AZ beers too. Vegetarian friendly. Only thing to make this place rockstar is the needed addition of gluten free crust."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I have had anywhere in the US.  And to also have a few of their own craft beers even makes it better.  This is a great local hangout, and as a visitor, I am so glad I found it that I ate here 2 nights in a row.  I only wish business brought me to Scottsdale more than 4x a year."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. 
Perfect evening out on the patio. 
Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the place stayed busy.  Unfortunately, there were way too many bugs flying around and it seemed to get worse as the night went on."}
{"text":"This place is a little off the beaten path but was a good find thanks to yelp.  Nice spot if you like to try different craft beers. They had an interesting selection of gourmet pizza's and they take pride in using local grown ingredients. My pizza was a little burned and that kind of washed out the intended taste but it was still pretty good. Not sure if wood fired pizza is supposed to be a little burned or not. If I were to go back I'd ask them to make my pizza less well done."}
{"text":"Great selection of Arizona craft beer plus handcrafted pizza?! Came here on a Wednesday night and both bartenders were part owners. The Spanish pizza was great: Spanish chorizo, olives, and almonds?! So great. As the boyfriend cheekily says, \"It dares to be different.\" And prices are VERY fair."}
{"text":"Loved it! My parents came into town and my dad is a beer lover. It was the perfect place with so many local beers on tap. Our waitress was so friendly and knowledgeable. She recommended the sausage pizza and the FICA pizza. We ended up getting both of her recommendations and she was not wrong! So good!!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Brian, our server, was excellent.  We had a pepperoni pizza and a margarita pizza.  Both were delicious, but the pepperoni was fantastic.  I also enjoyed a shandy.  Special dessert too- a Nutella and plantain calzone with honey drizzle.
Bravo Craft 64!"}
{"text":"Just went tonight with my boyfriend to grab a beer and happy hour food. $8 focaccia caprese sandwich, and $8 cheesy garlic bread... sooo good! He had the Smooove Hoperator IPA and I had College Street v. Beauregarde blue berry sour. Waitstaff was friendly and knowledgeable about their food and beer. Will definitely be back for the woodfired pizza"}
{"text":"If I could give 6 stars I would!  I have been wanting to check this place out for a while and finally went last night.  Beer was great, other patrons were friendly and we had a great time!  I love the small town pub vibe, I think this is my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place open on Christmas, but wanted food. Owner told us to come in and promised we wouldn't go hungry. Glad we did! Great selections on drinks and he put out a complimentary spread for all. Great host. We will be back. Looking forward to trying the pizza."}
{"text":"Great ARIZONA BREWED beers on tap. Husband had the Farmer's Market Salad which was a fresh mix of greens with a tangy spice of candied peppers. I had the Caprese Salad with their same-day, homemade mozzarella cheese and local grown tomatoes. We shared the charcuterie board with meats, cheeses, bread and a fine blend of mixed nuts, pumpkin seeds and dried cranberries. The waitress was attentive and friendly. Scott, a co-owner stopped and chatted and freely answered our questions about the business. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's right down from the Valley Ho in Old Town. Been there twice. Just got back from lunch after convincing the designers I work with to give it a try. Absolutely delicious. They were glad we went. Got the Carne pizza and the Blanca pizza. I wouldn't have ordered the Blanca myself, being a carnivore, but I'm glad the girls did because it was phenomenal. Caprese salad was great too. Chatted with the owner, Scott, and he told us they source most of their ingredients locally and its all fresh. I guess they don't have a freezer. He said they make their own mozzarella and pizza dough and that the cook was the sous chef at Pizzeria Bianca in Phoenix (yes, the famous one). They also have a boatload of craft beers on tap, all Arizona brewed. I tried the Sweet Thang Creme Brulee Imperial Stout and wow, I'm hooked. At 10% alcohol you have to be careful because it's tasty and will kick you in the butt before you know it.

Service was friendly.

Anyway, I want this place to succeed, but selfishly, I don't want it to get too popular because I hate waits. Will definitely being going back in the near future!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, wine list is awesome and the pizza is so good!!!! The staff made us feel like family. Brian Wilson was our waiter and made the difference. 5 stars all the way. Scott the owner even came by to make sure all was good. You have to go."}
{"text":"Great pizza, thin crust pizza with nice bubbles! We had Margherita, Arizona Special*, Fico and Aji* we also had the market salad which was fresh and with nice slices of prosciutto. And to top it of, they had local cold beer. Great place!"}
{"text":"Great dining experience.  The staff was wonderful, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and drinks.  So happy we started our vacation there.  Thanks again to the crew at Craft 64.

Don and Joan"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Hotel Valley Ho a block down from Craft 64, they highly recommended this place. I walked over, there were 6 people sitting at the bar, I sat at a table for 10 minutes and nobody checked in on me, I stood up and left."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great beer, great service, great place. The dough is amazing. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time while visiting during Spring Training. It was ok. Service was eh. Beer options and list was great. Our waiter thought we were \"silly\" for wanting to do flights because we might not like the taster and then it's a waste of beer. Obviously he knows nothing about beer or why people like to do flights to begin with."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, local...my kale and pear salad was amazing.  The pizza was fresh, interesting and not weird.  All food is made from scratch on site daily.  Yum!  Unassuming exterior and simple decor inside with friendly service.  A wonderful find!  So glad I live close enough to frequent this newer restaurant."}
{"text":"When we arrived you can see the place has little management going for it. We had a reservation, but didnt like the table in the middle of the floor, so we asked to sit at the bar. The hostess did a great job of moving the backpack one guy had sprawled across three empty chairs and the other guy had his food spread across 2 chairs while he left to take a phone call.

The bartender should be handling this, if I owned a place and had 10 bar seats, with 2 filled and the rest occupied by this JERKS junk, I would be pissed off. Really dude? You came to the bar/pizza place with your laptop to do what? (That's a rhetorical question)

Then hyperactive barhop guy is cleaning glasses off the bar and squeezing them so hard, he literally broke one against his chest??? WTF? 

Now there are 4 of us at the bar, NOT ONCE did the Bartender initiate a \"Can I get you something?\", we had to ask each team, even waited quite a while to order until I yelled \"HEY CAN WE ORDER\" (I bet now you remember who I am)

While eating the salad and olive bowl, which wasnt bad, simple fresh food, I asked for a napkin. The hyper guy goes somewhere else to get me a napkin? You dont have napkins at the bar? and he comes back with one damn napkin? One napkin? Like he stole it from Wendys. It was good for one wipe of the crud from my face. I then asked if he had anymore....he then ran back to the napkin stash and brought us 2 NAPKINS....splurged on us!

The only one I saw using any common sense and working hard was the hostess, so we made sure a generous tip was left just for her.

The place is OK, but could use some direction , management and it looks like some appreciation of the better employees."}
{"text":"Stopped in 64 on a whim. All I can say is fantastic!!! Service, food, and drink all perfect. These guys are in a off location but worth finding and visiting.  Keep up the great work!!! I look forward to being a regular :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza! All fresh, local ingredients! Amazing local beer selection! Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Sat out on the back patio and enjoyed a lovely evening with a few flights of beer and a great pizza. 
Brian Wilson, our waiter was FANTASTIC!! Good service always makes a meal for me. 

We had the bistro bacon salad which was surprisingly unique and delicious! For pizza- get the Fico and add prosciutto- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Craft 64 is an excellent spot in Scottsdale and would be at the top of high-end beer bars in any US city.  They do a great job focusing on a wide variety of local beer, but also offer wine and speciality cocktails too.  The food is not pricey, very good quality and there are many options, including healthy options (great salads).  Their pizza is excellent (that is coming from a NY pizza snob).  It is not NY, but it shouldn't be in Scottsdale and it is excellent quality/tasting pizza.  Very nice service and a decent layout add to Craft 64's appeal.  I visited recently with 12 people and they were able to easily accommodate and take care of us.  Give Craft 64 a try!"}
{"text":"The pizzas and beer selection are always on point! My boyfriend and I love this place. I have recommended this place to a few friends. I am docking a star because there is a 50/50 chance of bad service (We have been here about 8 times). Unfortunately two of the friends we told to come here had bad service."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and a great selection of local beers! Great for out of towners and locals alike. Staff is both friendly and knowledgeable, suggest you stop in."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here for lunch on our  vacation to Scottsdale.  This place is AWESOME!   

Great beer selection. I would definitely recommend the beers the restaurant owner brews himself.  Crafty Blonde (a lighter beer) and Smooove Hoperator (an IPA) were two of our favorites.  

We started off with the classic Bruschetta which was very fresh.  The pizza was thin crust and flavorful.  We tried the Carne (pepperoni & sausage) and the Blanco (white pizza with spinach and garlic).  Both were great but the Blanco was exceptional. 

Not to mention the ambiance of this place was chill and comfortable.  The staff were very friendly and we could have stayed there all afternoon!  There is a nice, large outdoor patio as well. 

I'm still dreaming about this place two weeks later. It's a MUST TRY if you're in downtown Scottsdale and enjoy a great beer, pizza, and ambiance."}
{"text":"This place is AWEFUL! !!! The drinks were good but they don't even have RANCH dressing!!! What pizza and salad place doesn't have ranch dressing?!? On top of that we had stomach pains all day the day after! I'll never recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The blanco pizza was one of the best pizzas !! Mosco mule is great!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh farm to table, with a creative twist. Delicious Artisan sandwiches pizza and salads. We stopped here a couple of times on our trip to Scottsdale and enjoy the Spanish Pizza caprese sandwich and The BLT sandwich, charcuterie board, tomato mozzarella salad and a peach kale pumpkin seed salad,. To top off these delicious meals we enjoyed crafts beer mr. big Mango Pucker, wheat the people
And the refreshing Artisan craft ginger beer.  We even got a growler to go, This is a must stop in Scottsdale we highly recommend you go out of your way to find craft 64 6922 Main Street Scottsdale Arizona"}
{"text":"The pizza was ok but nothing unique.  The service was slow since they were busy and the pizza was rushed since the center of it was still a mush even though we asked for a well crispy center.  Good beer selection but they failed on the food."}
{"text":"Amazing. Locally owned and they buy all their produce locally. They have I think 36 beers on tap and they were all Arizona beers. Service was friendly and the prices were reasonable. I didn't get a chance to try the pizza but the chef worked at Pizzeria Bianco for 17 yrs. I had the caprese sandwich and it was so damn good. Can't wait to check out this place again."}
{"text":"Came in with my entire family and everyone was pleased. The owner was very welcoming, the pizza was perfect, and the beer was ice cold. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The beer was so good! My friend and me came here after work, ordered two cups of beer and some pizza. We enjoyed ourselves!"}
{"text":"Nice to find a small beer and pizza place with character and soul in the heart of Scottsdale AZ. Their Smoove Hoperator is one of the best hop beers crafted. It's crisp, clean, and actually smooth! Pizza from a real wood fired oven is delicious. Sandwiches are perfect. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and great drinks. Service is fair. Kinda slow at times. We've been there 4 times and it's hit or miss. We will try again though. It's in our neighborhood and we like that !"}
{"text":"We came here on Saturday, May 9th and found out that it was their official grand opening and 64th day of business. 

We started with the cantaloupe topped with prosciutto. My girlfriend ordered a glass of white wine and we were offered another half glass on the house of another white wine to pair with our appetizer. Did not disappoint. 

We had the Blano pizza with spinach and that was also amazing. The server was friendly knowledgable and attentive. 

We asked which dessert he would recommend (at the time of writing, there were only 2). He said the tiramisu is the only item on the menu not made in house, but was delicious. The other dessert was a banana and Nutella dessert topped with native AZ honey. There were 4 of us total so we ordered both and they were awesome. We will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"The best craft beer, wood-fired pizza, and location in Scottsdale. It's on a neighborhood street in the garden district.  Service is friendly and knowledgeable. There are locally made beers.  The happy hour prices are reasonable.  You are getting legitimate wood-oven pizza.  Indoor and outdoor seating.  Clean, open kitchen concept.  Salads are as good as the pizza. Everything is done with care."}
{"text":"Best pizza place I've found, ever! Great owners who are both welcoming and very friendly. It is a weekly spot for my wife and I and it never gets old!"}
{"text":"Walked here from the Hotel Valley ho. The pizza combos are amazing and top that off with a cold beer. It's no wonder the place is jammed. Great fresh ingredients and super staff are a win win. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This would be an incredible place if all they had was the wine and extensive craft beer selection along with the expert bartenders and great service. But they also have an incredible menu. I can only vouch for the wood-fired pizzas, WOW amazing, forget about Pizzeria Bianco. This is the place to go, especially if you prefer the thin burnt cracker Roman style crust over the puffy Neapolitan style that is more often found at local wood-fired pizzerias. The mozzarella is hand-made. The sausage is from Schreiner's, a local legend; however they have them add fennel to the sausage. This makes it more like traditional Italian salsiccia. The dough itself is incredible. I cannot say enough good things about this place, we will return for more pizza and wine and craft beers!"}
{"text":"I like beer and I appreciate supporting local brews. In all honesty I have not seen several of the beers they have here! This place is clean, inviting and they even have some mule varieties that I have yet to see anywhere else. I highly recommend Craft 64."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and local craft beer selection. It was a fun experience at the bar with the knowledgeable staff and numerous local beers on draft!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying Craft 64.  Came highly recommended from the concierge at The Phoenician. Though we had a 5:30 pm reservation - we actually waited well over 5 minutes for any one resembling a hostess to greet us.  Once someone did - he was completely flummoxed and did not know where to sit us.  Said he would be right back and disappeared for a few minutes - when he came back he told us to seat ourselves.  So we did. The same man dropped off menus and said to give him a moment.  He had a moment all right...we watched him set up a table for eleven, answer the phone, sit more people but never returned to our table.  After 15 minutes, my husband got up to ask the waitress who was serving the table directly behind us if she or anyone else would be taking our order.  She was rude and snapped at us, and said she had no idea anyone even sat us down.  She questioned us as to how we got menus as there's a 30 minute wait and they were not seating anymore people because there's only 2 people working right now.  
Going up in a restaurant business I told her I certainly hope my staff would never speak to our guests the way she just did. I told her we had a reservation - again more rudeness and she stormed off.  So we left.  Bottom line...if you are short staffed - it is not the diners fault.  All they had to do was be upfront when we walked in the door that they were short staffed, and service may be a bit slow but we'll try our best.  We would of been okay with that and most likely stayed and given it a chance."}
{"text":"Craft 64 is a great place. A friend recommended we go there and so I checked out the reviews. They were all great and the restaurant didn't disappoint in real life. We had the Aji pizza and the Sausage pizza. Both were excellent. Their special over really helps make excellent crust that is an integral part of the pizza. The ingredients are fresh and some pizzas are traditional while others are unique, so you can find something that's interesting to you. The Aji pizza is incredibly hot, btw! So be prepared if you go with that choice. My friend had a bunch of beers and said they were all really good. In fact, they have a very big craft beer selection. The cherry on the top was that the owner and chef stopped by our table and took our order so we were made to feel right at home. This is a great place!"}
{"text":"Roger and James are excellent with service, and offer some delicious local beers. They also brew their own - my favorite is the white wheat! Highly recommend stopping in for amazing beer and pizza. Also, a cute, inviting patio with good music."}
{"text":"I am an east coaster and a pizza snob. 
This pizza is delicious. The marinara tomato sauce on the pizza is first rate and fresh. The salad was extraordinary with the wine vinegar and great olive oil.
I will definitely return at least once per week for this delicious pizza! Parking might be hard on the weekends, but believe me it is worth it!"}
{"text":"1. $15 bottomless beermosas or champagne on the weekend 
2. Margarita Prosciutto pizza 
3. Service 
4. Patio
5. Beer taps & cheap growler refills  
6. O yea... #1, mimosas"}
{"text":"Excellent wood-fired pizza and huge, tasty beer selection.  The best wood-fired pizza I've had the Valley (Bianco, sadly, is past its prime and now has to be filed under \"overrated\").  Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Great food and beer. I love the ingredients and food are locally sourced. We meet friends for dinner and drinks. The pizza is amazing.  We will go back again"}
{"text":"Stopped by with the wife during an evening bike ride. Great beer selection and loved the atmosphere. Food was spectacular. We were here later in the night, but noticed they had a happy hour food menu. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Love the neighborhood feel and the staff is incredible! We had a party of 6 on a busy Friday night and the hostess, Christina, was very helpful and accommodating. The food is great too! Highly recommend the Aji Pizza."}
{"text":"Fantastic Pizza. The Aji Pizza was the best pie I have ever had. Spicy, complex, great crust.  10 out of 10.  The beer selection was great as well.  Will definitely be back.."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great beers. Recommend their Jalapeño based pizza for those who like to try a spicy an different pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza was great. As well as their beer selection. But the service was meh. Felt like I only saw my server one time."}
{"text":"Truly an amazing place! Food was beyond delicious and the beer selection was superb. On top of that the owners are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Phil Jackson, Steven Spielberg, John Williams... All masters of their craft. James Swann, one of four owners at Craft, another master of his CRAFT. He really set the tone for our dining & drinking experience late one Wednesday afternoon.

It all culminated into one moment when James mentioned how crazy it can get some days when all the conventions and events come through town. \"I can't get each table and customer like I want to.\" That for me is everything. An owner that would rather provide 30 incredible experiences than turn each table 4 or 5 times. Speaks volumes of his passion not only for the business, but for his customers.

James' love for beer shines and their selection at 64 is deep. Whatever you're into, they'll find something for you. They've also got a full bar should beer not be your forté.

As for the pizza, I've been up and down each coast and across the country slaying all kinds of coal-fired pizza. This is tops. Hands down. All their ingredients are sourced locally, and you can really taste a difference. It's all in the details, and they haven't left any to chance.

And if you're curious about the '64' in Craft 64. Look no further than the growler. All 64 ounces."}
{"text":"This place has killer pizzas! They also have a really good beer list, some brewed by them. Atmosphere is good, small but decent amount of seating. Patio out back too. Overall we all really liked the place and will be back."}
{"text":"Came in Halloween night with my boyfriend. Dennis took care of us very well. Educated us on different beers, was extremely personable and friendly. Some of the best service in the valley. Had so much fun, thank you for making my first visit (and not my last) , memorable."}
{"text":"A friend took me out for a birthday happy hour and we went to craft 64. The ambience is fabulous the waiters are amazing and the food is absolutely yummy."}
{"text":"Cartel Coffee Brown ~ Nitro ~ delicious!!!
Great food and beer!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the outside, towards the back there is a bar and outdoor seating. The vibe is casual and the service was very good. Good selection of beer and the wine list is really good. The pizza....WOW! That's one of the best artesian pizzas I've had in a while super fresh and delicious a must have. We ordered a pepperoni and cheese and it was absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"Best pizza you can get in the Scottsdale area. I recommend the Fico pizza. I honestly do not eat any other pizza than craft 64. Amazing beer list, amazing pizza and OUTSTANDING service"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Caprese salad and Carne pizza this evening. Excellent choices. Would do the same again.

Happy Hour red blend paired well with the food.

Service was excellent. Food came out quick.

F."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim as it was close to our hotel. The drinks were phenomenal! The happy hour drink list was pretty short though. The service was very good and attentive. Pizza was also very delicious! Charcuterie board was a little off - some slices of meats, various cheeses, 3 olives, grapes, nuts and olive oil. I'd probably recommend a different app unless you think only having 3 olives isn't weird. Otherwise great experience and definitely considering coming back to get a growler of their beer!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza, wine and beer.  Dennis was our waiter, loved his recommendations on pizza, wine, and his personality!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks here are absolutely fantastic! Everything is made in-house and is fresh. Some of the best pizza I have ever had in my entire life."}
{"text":"The blanco pizza with prosciutto is incredible! And I love the Georgia Peach Mule. I love this place!"}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza, salad and had some drinks all of which were really good. My only issue is service wasn't all that great. It took awhile to order drinks and getting our check and no one came to check on us for more drinks or anything during our meal."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere.We were told the salad was big enough for two, but it was very small and overpriced at $12.  Pizza was good and reminded me of Grimaldi's.  Overall food was good but overpriced.  Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!!! I found this pizza/ craft beer place based on good ratings.
So happy I chose this. Such wonderful pizzas cooked in a pizza  oven. The mozzarella cheese is made here daily. I have not been this pleased with a pizza in such a large no time. Great friendly service too. I willl be back!!
If you enjoy craft beers, stop by to check out this cool place with an outdoor patio.
Btw The Peppa Formaggio Pizza is out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food beats most in the area,. We were greeted immediately and the beers came out directly after. Although the pizza was perfectly cooked it showed up so fast it felt like they already knew out order before we made it."}
{"text":"I always hit up Craft 64 when I come to town and I am never disappointed. The Blanco pizza is my fav!"}
{"text":"What a great find on our trip to Scottsdale! Killer service, fantastic brick oven pizza and fun atmosphere! Inhaled my food before I thought to take a picture of our pizzas;)"}
{"text":"Fantastic beer and fantastic pizza. One of the owners was present and he was very familiar with the beers and identified the hops in the pale ale for me. Very good beer and it went great with the Aji pizza. Will seek this location out again and will look for them as their distribution gets bigger."}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen... My new go to brick oven pizza spot. This place cannot be beat! Dozens of Arizona craft beers, authentic hand made wood fired pizza done to perfection. This place is world class across the board. Boom!"}
{"text":"Such a great place for brunch.  You must have the breakfast pizza.  Seriously one of the best!  Beer is great staff is amazing."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Craft 64 for a few months, but we recently met some friends for dinner and drinks. I love that all of the beers on tap at Craft 64 are from Arizona... BIG fan of drinking local when I can. That, and they have several of their own beers on tap. 

We had a great experience, as usual, and I got to spend some quality time with James. He is extremely knowledgeable about the beers on tap, and takes the time to come over, talk about them, and explain what ingredients were used. That touch goes a long way for a fan of craft beer, and will truly help someone that isn't familiar with a particular style to have a better understanding of the craft. 

Sheryl ordered a pizza, but I ate the crust! I was focused on my beers. James did recommend the next time she orders the pizza to add prosciutto. He even went as far as to grab a few slices for her to try. 

We had a blast, and I cannot wait to go back. The staff is incredible, the service was awesome, and they truly know what they are doing. The building is really cool, too! Just SO good. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Wow! What an experience!!! Wood fired pizza, the BEST local beer selection in town. 36 taps, all local"}
{"text":"We had a group of 6 here for happy hour. I really liked the happy hour plates and salivated over the BLT that my sister ordered. Over all I thought this was a great place to go for a glass of wine and a cheese board. Provided a great atmosphere to catch up with friends and the service was consistent. Major points scored by the young man that seated us, he gave us an overview of the menu, happy hour, wine and beer list and the establishment. Made it very easy for us to have our orders ready when the waitress arrived and made us excited to order our food!"}
{"text":"This place is great. We came in for a couple of beers and something to snack on, and they delivered. The place is very clean, service is sharp and friendly, and the fact that they only feature local beers from AZ really sold me. Give it a try. I think you might like it too.


An hour later......

So we decided to stay and have dinner. FANTASTIC! You can literally taste how fresh everything is. James, the owner and bartender, was absolutely the best. I wish nothing but the best for this place. There is a formula for success here that should be tasted. Please come support this wonderful gem. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Pizza is to die for, with the local ingredients and the House Made Mozzarella you just can't beat this place! Also they have a wide variety of beer, all brewed here in Arizona. This is a must try spot!"}
{"text":"Newer place only open 50 some days.  Went with friends to try the food and beer.  The beer selection was really nice, good choices no matter what you like, and all local craft beers.  The food was good as well. Not too over the top, but not hum-drum either. I split the Bruschetta, a Caprese salad, and some margarita pizza we added prosciutto too.  All we good.  Our waiter and one of the owners who stopped by to say high were attentive, knowledgeable, and fun to chat with.  The location is a modest house with the front porch and backyard turned into patio seating. Like the food the decor was well done, but not pretentious.  A lot of \"craft beer\" places just try too hard, or being in Old Town Scottsdale they are just way too snooty.  Craft 64 is neither. A comfortable place with good food, great service, and a fun selection of local beers."}
{"text":"Craft 64 is such an excellent place that I cannot stop raving about!!! 

I'm gonna as usual start with the starters. To start this time we got salad. The salad was very well prepared. The greens were very flavorful and it was served in a good big proportion. Now I'm gonna skip to the main course because it was the best meal I have ever had in my LIFE!! 

For the main meal we got two pizzas. One was a pizza with half cheese and the other half was spinach which I could not get enough of, the other pizza was the Spain pizza. The cheese pizza was the only one I enjoyed. The cheese was perfectly melted and hugged the pizza and under the main layer of cheese was sort of like a cheese sauce. The cheese sauce was the reason I could not get enough of. After all of this we had no room for dessert. 

The service is very \"epic\" here and the waiters and waitresses were very courteous. I think the decor Is awesome and they have so many television sets that the big game will never be missed. 

I am so happy to come back here next time in town and I think everybody should have the experience I had here (which they will)"}
{"text":"We live about a 15-minute walk away from Craft 64 and we feel fortunate to be able to introduce friends and family to it fairly often. It's considered perhaps the best place to go in Old Town Scottsdale for drink specials and appetizers at happy hour, which runs from 4:00-7:00 every day, and they have a lively clientele at mealtime as well. 

Pizza's are particularly popular there, as well as their salads. Wood-fired focaccia sandwiches, bruschcetta, and desserts  are also really good. 

They have a large, private, and quiet outdoor patio in back, and a few tables outside near the front entrance. Service is excellent--including friendly. 

Give Craft 64 a try. Then you can thank me for the advice. :-)"}
{"text":"Never ever disappointed and we've been here quite a bit! The staff is always friendly and attentive with excellent recommendations. My personal favorite is the Fico Pizza... amazing combination of just-right-flavors. And if you need a wine recommendation, just ask Roger. He's an Aussie Somm and knows his list (he should, he picks it by hand. So you really can't go wrong with anything there!). Great place to have a party too. Thanks, Roger, for fixing it up for us. We had a blast and made memories equal to the landmark occasion!"}
{"text":"Charming casual place, very near downtown Scottsdale. Great drinks, good prices, tasty pizza, friendly people, cute patio. Great place to relax with fun happy hour. Mixed family crowd of all ages."}
{"text":"Stellar service and delicious food. One of the owners was frequently on the floor and checking in with us, and the wait staff was attentive and accommodating. The beer selection is a bit too skewed toward IPAs, but there's still a good selection and it's great to see all AZ beers. The pizza and desserts are very obviously made from high quality ingredients, and the flavors were bright and strong. I will most definitely come back, and I'll bring friends."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place different than all the rest in Old Scottsdale and this is just the place. It has great pizza! There is also an amazing list of AZ brewed craft beers & their specialty Moscow Mule is now one of my favorite drinks! 
We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent!  Service is horrible!  Staff was too worried about their friends at the bar than about the customers that would tip them.. I would suggest not going until they work out the issues with the staff."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.
We sat on the patio, which is quaint, but nice and started with the HIGHLY recommended mascarpone and fig bruschetta and Spaceship cider... my god, they are both incredibly good. Paired with a pizza, we were stuffed leaving. 
The waiter (although a Tottenham fan; we are the Arsenal) was quick on serving us and providing us with his favorite items- he was awesome and easy to talk to even with his team choice ;)
Being from San Diego, we can't wait to vacay in Scottsdale again so we can revisit this delectable place."}
{"text":"I love pizza. So much. Sooooo soooooo much. And this place nailed it. 

I've only been once but it was so delicious that I'll have to go back again. We also ordered the charcuterie plate which I thoroughly enjoyed.

The one knock I have on Craft 64 has nothing to do with their food or service. It's loud as hell in there. Something about the architecture of the building makes sound bounce around the room and my party of three at our indoor table had to shout to hear each other because the bar nearby was full. Everyone at the bar was at least 3-4 feet above us too which could have caused part of the problem.

If you're going and it isn't too hot then sit outside, otherwise ask them to sit you near the front of the restaurant so the bar noise doesn't overtake your meal."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I sat at the bar and had wonderful talks with the owners. They were so sweet, down-to-earth and kind.  My cucumber cooler martini was delicious and Jim loved their house-made Crafty Blonde.  Our meat and cheese platter was delicious and perfect for the intense heat of the day.  Visit this adorable restaurant...You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"What is it with the Phoenix area and pizza?  Having had great pizzas in SF (leader in the artisan style), LA, and NYC (old school), three of the best pizzas I've had were in Phoenix.  I loved both Bianco and Pomo.  Add a third to the list of Craft 64.  The pizza had an excellent crust.  I think the weak part was the sauce which needed more body.  A huge plus for Craft 64 is a great collection of beer.  What a fantastic place.  I hope it's not insanely crowded if I'm in town for spring training."}
{"text":"Solely based on service! The owner is amazing and went out of his way to accommodate us! The food is probably a 4 star. The carne pizza is awesome, just a little steep in price."}
{"text":"What a great find this place was. There is indoor and outdoor seating, which in Scottsdale means that you can be outside most of the year. Excellent pizzas, with a truly outstanding crust. Neapolitan-style, so there's a bit of a char to the crust. Over 30 beers on tap, some Craft 64 and some rotating from other local breweries.  One of our party had the crafty blonde, which was excellent. Another tried Wheat the People salted caramel which started out very pleasant but became progressively too rich and intense. It would be best served as a cordial and not a pint. Knowledgeable and motivated staff."}
{"text":"This pizza rivals Bianco, if you're familiar with the Phoenix area pizza. Amazing white pizza (although once it was waaaayyy over done) and awesome service. If you want good craft beer and awesome service then you've found your home..."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great beer.  A super addition for craft beer lovers.  Local drafts and all food made in house. Can't wait for their grand opening!!"}
{"text":"Awesome new place.  A ton of local brews and wine selections to pair with amazing pizza selections.  The former chef of Pizza Bianco is running the kitchen.  I had never been there but the fig, truffle with prosciutto pizza is amazing! Definitely be back for daily happy hour. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for a friend's wedding. I had just arrived in town and took a cab from the airport to grab food and drinks till friends arrived.  Craft 64 looked pretty good based on reviews so I had cab take me there.  Very glad I did.  This is a very cool establishment.  The bartenders/owners were extremely friendly and obviously passionate about their food and beers.  I ordered an initial flight (4 of your choosing) of beers.  I love love love the selection of local beers they offer. Seriously, its an impressive list.  Bartender was very helpful in picking the beers. He arranged them in the best drinking order too.  I ordered a pepperoni pizza and it came out hot and fast.  You can see the cook making the dough from the bar and the quality is undeniable.  A thin crust pizza, the pizza was perfectly cook with perfect crispiness.  And it was a large amount of food.  The only downside is the price is a little expensive (17 for a medium size pizza) is a little much.  But I guess it is Scottsdale so what do you expect.  I was there for a while so I really appreciate that the bartender kept giving me free samples of different beers.  Truly, this is a gem of a place and if I lived in the area would go back again and again."}
{"text":"Visited Craft 64 for lunch. My husband & I both had the Historic Piehole Porter to drink. Very delicious. Shared a carne pizza which was also tasty. Service was a bit slow but we weren't in any rush that day. Definitely would go back. The craft beer list was quite impressive. Would recommend Craft 64 to beer & pizza lovers."}
{"text":"Great little pizza place. The beer list is top notch and they carry some fantastic beers I have never heard of which is a super plus. Pizza is a little expensive for thin crust. I was still hungry after one to myself."}
{"text":"My old man has been hounding me to go get pizza with him at this place for months. 

Finally got over last weekend for his birthday anniversary. It was good, but not mind blowing.

The building itself is nice; an old house, like \"The House\" restaurant next door that I've been to. Small patios front and back, and a small bar in the back of the dining room. 

Pizzas were good. Crust was pretty much perfect, really enjoyed it. Not too chewy, not too dense, not too airy and surrounded in a semi-crisp outer layer of light char. Nice.

Ordered 3 pizzas; The Spain, which was OK, the Sausage, which was solid, and the Aji, which was my favorite. I like new pizza combinations that aren't overly hip and pretentious (i.e. the fig mess I saw lower down the menu), which actually work. This one worked. And it's got some legitimate heat to it. Try it.

This place is let down by 2 issues that turned me off:

First, the service was inconsistent and slow. Our waiter was doing triple duty covering inside and outside. Our pizzas came out fast, but drinks felt a little neglected/empty. Need a least one more body covering the joint.

Second, the beer list. When I saw \"100% Arizona Beers,\" my heart sank. Why limit yourself to just one state of craft beers, and have that state be a state that is not known for exceptional craft beers? I don't get it. They handicapped themselves big time here. I've seen or had most of what they had on offer, and none of it blew my skirt up. I had a few typically forgettable AZ IPAs on this visit, only because I can't drink water with pizza.

Overall, a decent pizza spot that is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Outstanding and worth ever star. Food was delicious and the selection of beer was more than adequate. The restaurant is small and more outdoor than indoor seating. We ended up at the bar/counter which was fine and got to watch the food being prepped which was fun. The service was great and the staff was very attentive and friendly. We ordered the C-pizza lol the name was a bit long but all veggies and delish. Our starter was the garlic bread and because we were starving, we ordered bruschetta as well ... all was soo good. I will be back!"}
{"text":"We decided we wanted to eat pizza for dinner tonight and we are SO GLAD we chose Craft 64!  The beer selection was great, the pizza was perfectly delicious, and the service was amazing.  A wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"36 az only draft beers!!! 
Yes yes yes and their food, super awesome and tasty, everything is made from scratch!!! Mind blowing!!! My favorite place now! And manager and owner, superb ! Service ... excellent!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a local brewery for dinner and this place got great reviews. Well, it didn't disappoint. We sat outside in the back patio since the weather was so nice. The craft beer selection was good and there was something for each of us. The staff was great. They were attentive and helped us with food suggestions. He recommended their fresh homemade mozzarella and the charcuterie for appetizer and then the Blanco pizza with ricotta, fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, garlic and spinach. Omg the pizza was amazing! We will definitely come back here next year for our annual trip."}
{"text":"Craft 64 is another great new addition to the Old Town Scottsdale scene.  What makes this restaurant unique is that every beer they serve are all from local Arizona breweries with a few selections that they brew themselves.  The wood fire pizza's are definitely the star of the show.  All the ingredients are sourced locally with no freezers or microwaves in the place.  They even make their mozzarella fresh each day.  Definitely a place to try when you come to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is such a very relaxing and grand experience every time I've gone here. The employees are extremely helpful and will guide you through the beer list and wine list like a pro. The service is exceptional and every time I go there it's very prompt. The food is outstanding and I love The pizzas. I'll have to explore more of the food and of course I will be back. The back patio is extremely comfortable and worth sitting out back when it's cooler. I have taken several of my friends there and they all love the place."}
{"text":"We were wandering around the Scottsdale area and found this place. Best thing we did. We ate here twice and brought friends back with us.
Amazing food and great happy hour. We do not live in Arizona but it will remain on our list when we return."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere of Craft 64. The hostess was such a sweetie really liked her nice smile that greeted us right when we walked in. It's a very casual place which is nice since it's in Old Town Scottsdale, and I wasn't sure what to expect. Our server was very knowledgeable of the beers and what was good on the menu. He told us to get the cheesy garlic bread which we did. I wish it would've came out before the pizza we ordered, but that's okay. The cheesy bread was good. It was extra cheesy! Our pizza was delicious. Everything is freshly prepared and ingredients are all fresh & local  We each had a beer which hit the spot on a hot summer evening. Check them out you won't regret it.  Oh I gave them 4 stars because the main dish (pizza) came out before our appetizer. Other than that service was great!"}
{"text":"How many wood fired pizza places can one small city support? The prices for these small pies start at $17 and head up into the $20 plus range. If your dying to try the same pizza that every other place serves, you might be better off at HH where a small pie can be had for $7 bucks or so. If you don't like that thin, wood-fired, foo foo pizza then this isn't your place.
Otherwise, I also was disturbed to see so many diners using a knife and fork to eat this stuff - I really feel like heckling these folks everytime it happens. 
   Otherwise, the patio is nice, the staff was helpful (was here for an event) and the beer selection is great. They have a few other food items, but mostly pizza. The location is in that tourist hub area, so that maybe the crowd that eats there just doesn't know any better. I can really only enjoy real NY pizza - try folding one of Craft 64's slices!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place. It's a nice small restaurant a bit west of the main Old Town Scottsdale cluster of businesses. Tried the sausage/pepperoni pizza which was good. My BF was happy with his beer selection and list options. I'm not a beer drinker and didn't feel like wine so I went got a standard cocktail which was surprisingly weak and not good. We were there Friday evening 6ish and sat at the communal table which was fine. Frankly I'm surprised there was a place to sit at all. The dual patios looked tempting and spacious but it's still too hot here in AZ to take advantage. The one huge Negative we both agreed on and may deter us from returning was the noise level. There's nothing to deaden the sound inside and it was so loud that we couldn't hear each other even though we were sitting side by side! Such a turn off for an otherwise inviting neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Great service. Great selection. Great food. Highly recommended. Keith was an excellent host, more than attentive and very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"My first trip here. Met a client here for lunch and so damn glad I did! He loved his Caprese salad and I positively loved my fennel sausage pizza. I felt like I was back in Italy. It being St. Patty's Day and all, I was in the mood for a lighter craft beer. The Scottsdale Blonde hit the spot! :) Who says that? I love this place! Service was perfect!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and an awesome beer selection! They have local beers and you can get a flight which gives you a chance to try a few. The place is cute and chill, with a great atmosphere. Nothing overdone, but everything great. Our server, Blake, was knowledgeable and made great recommendations."}
{"text":"Craft 64 is a unique and captivating experince. Yes their food , beer, wine exceed expectations, but the atmosphere is relaxing and if you want, the conversation is exhilarating. The owners are totally hands on and will remember you the next time you go there. Well, I am going to go there now (from Mesa!)"}
{"text":"Cozy local spot.  Nice bar with additional high tops.  Knowledgeable staff to help out of towners select a good AZ brew.  Had a Pale Ale from Peoria, it was excellent.   The brick oven pizza was good, a little pricey imo.   Wood fired margarita pies go for around $12.00 all over San Diego, $16.00 here.   We enjoyed the ambiance, beer selection, mellow vibe and homemade pies.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"We came here for a bachelorette dinner and had the best server who recommended the caprese salad which was so fresh! And the fig and truffle oil pizza was perfect, not too rich. Overall AMAZING service and food. Absolutely come here for a craft beer and delicious pizza"}
{"text":"First time to Craft 64, but what a great place!  The staff was efficient and friendly, not mention fun.  The beer selection was awesome, had the Amber Ale and it was great.  We were a group of 6, so we ordered three different pizzas, each one was delicious.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The pizza is to die for, so authentic and homemade, bette than any chain. Front and back of house are very skilled and efficient."}
{"text":"Craft 64 has really good beer but man this place is loud! It's small and quaint and they even have a patio in the back but I wasn't digging the Scottsdale atmosphere. Too pretentious....you've heard the story before."}
{"text":"Had the caprese salad it was delicious! The red mango was also very good! They have tons of local  craft beer! The staff is very friendly  customer service was GREAT!"}
{"text":"We stopped here before heading to a birthday party to have a drink. They have a great variety of beers on tap. We ordered a flight to try a sample of some and they were all very good. We ended up ordering a pizza to share that was also very good! We'll definitely be back to taste some other things!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza I've ever had, and I've had a lot of pizza. They make their mozzarella fresh daily, and their pizza is baked in a classic wood burning oven. Excellent ingredients and friendly staff. It is quite a small place, and it can get crowded and noisy quick on the more popular nights. I would recommend going during lunch or sitting at an outside table during dinner."}
{"text":"I can't even tell you how much we loved this place. Not only is the food silly good, the owners are incredibly knowledgeable and sooo much fun to boot. You are majorly missing out if you pass up this place!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, and my apartment is right next door. The pizza is amazing! Caprese is always fresh, and I love that they carry craft beers from all over Arizona. However, every single time I've had A certain server he's been pretty rude. This is the only reason I will not dine in anymore, as it's become extremely uncomfortable. I used to work in the industry and I get everyone can have an off day, but this guy has gotta go.

Update: went to pick up a Togo order and guess who was there and still rude as ever. Who seriously huffs and puffs at someone because they ask for a side of Parmesan cheese and balsamic? Grow up little man. Like I said, this is why I won't dine in because just like the pizza crust, his attitude is the same. Crust AF."}
{"text":"Unbelievable pizza, amazing local taps, and great service.  Will be coming back here every chance I get!"}
{"text":"Great welcoming staff, excellent craft beer offerings, fresh and delicious food, in a relaxed, warm atmosphere!  Tucked back from the street, make sure not to walk on by.  A gem in a relatively lackluster restaurants area.  Don't be distracted by the shiny lights of restaurants on either side.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This please barely got one star. Worst service worse atmosphere absolutely the worst place I've ever been to. I will never go back. This place is ridiculous we waited a long time to get served. The food took about an hour to come out. Hey when I came out the pizza was burnt. The salad we got was soggy. It was swimming in water. I would recommend nobody go to this place and I can't believe it's still open."}
{"text":"As much as this itinerant food aficionado likes to try challenging and exciting restaurants when in a new city, I like pizza and beer as much as the next guy, too. Doubly so when the focus is on as much local and homemade ingredients as can be found at Craft 64. 

Beer is given the respect it's due, with three dozen of the most eclectic taps I've seen in a restaurant. Pistachio sours, berry wheats, chile beers, and kafir lime ales were all available, (though when one of the most popular beers in the area is an orange and vanilla wheat beer, it's not THAT surprising). There's an overwhelming amount of interesting beers to try, and if you've exhausted all of the local options, there's even four solid house beers to try. Bonus points for being an Untappd Verified Venue, so you always know what's available.

I had the carne pizza, which was topped with a bunch of wonderful cured meats. What I liked most about it was the crust - seasoned with just the right amount of chew, and a kiss of char from the brick oven. It's hard to find pizza places that give as much attention to the crust as the rest of the ingredients.

It's a small restaurant and the overflowing amount of supplies and wine left out in the open makes it seem a little messy, but in a disarming way. This isn't a fancy place, but with as much detail that's paid to their defining features, they're successful in everything they set out to do."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Great selection of beers on tap. Great atmosphere. Definitely recommend and I will go back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE PLACE!! We had the charcuterie appetizer and spaintea- AMAZING! The double IPA is well worth the 9% alcohol and the mango tea was too good to be true. You would be missing a lot if you don't go here- great food, great service, super atmosphere.  Misters on the patio- awesome place!!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Old Town. Great selection of craft beers for local, regional and national brands. I went here with a meet up group and sat outside in the front patio. The server got all of our orders correct except my friend who was the first to order, after 3 attempts it finally was corrected. This is a good place for groups or a date. 
There is no parking lot so you will need to park on the street."}
{"text":"Craft 64 is a relaxed new venue in downtown Scottsdale.  It is the perfect place to reconnect with friends and family, or just share an evening with someone special. There is no overpowering music and lightshow, just a great place to hang out and enjoy a HUGE selection of local Arizona beers and wine.  

The wood-fired pizza is fresh, and all locally sourced and made from scratch daily.  Even the creamy mozzarella is made on-site.  We had the Margarita pizza and added mushrooms.  The pizza was great- but the mushrooms were a sensational savory, we plan to order a side of mushrooms to nibble on next time. For dessert, we shared the tiramisu.  The mascarpone was perfect.  It was light and creamy and not overly sweet.  Buyers beware- if you plan on going to bed in the next 6 hours- pick another dessert.  The Dark Rum Espresso used in the tiramisu lives up to its name and packs a caffeinated punch. ;-)   

Go early- because parking is a premium commodity- or flag down a golf cart to take you there. Friendly staff will guide you through the maze of beverage selections and will ensure that you come back to try a multitude of offerings."}
{"text":"Fantastic service! Great food! A wonderfully charming local restaurant.  If you haven't been you have to go!!  We were late for our reservation because of a delayed flight.. They were so gracious and welcoming to us and even gave us a bottle of champagne to help us celebrate our trip.  They made us feel like we were old friends!  And then even got us a golf cart taxi to continue our night on the town.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Really liked craft 64. Fig and prosciutto pizza is amazing. Staff was super friendly. Owner or manager came over to make sure everything was great. Beer selection is awesome. They have a bunch of local Arizona beers. I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a casual spot in Scottsdale for a pint of beer or a glass of wine, this might be a good spot to try. A nice selection of 64 craft beers and fair wine list. The food menu is limited to items, like paninis and pizza, that can be cooked in a food fire oven. I had the steak and cheese panini and it was pretty good. My partner had the Italian panini (with pepperoni and sausage) and he enjoyed it. The big downfall here, though, is the slow and inattentive service. If you want to place your order or get another beer, water or your check, you'll need to track your server down. Just too relaxed in this regard."}
{"text":"Amazing local fresh food and local beer selection. The staff is amazingly friendly and knowledgable! Strongly recommend the Kale Pear Salad and Spain Pizza."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and really enjoy this place. First off they have an awesome beer list, the kind where it's way too hard to pick just one which is awesome that they offer flights of 4 so you don't have to. It's a great way to discover new beers and they support local which is another bonus. Their pizza is also fantastic, our server last night highly recommended the Spain pizza and it was a wonderful mashup of flavors. It had a bright red pepper harissa sauce with a spicy chorizo, creamy mozzarella, crunchy almonds and olives. Definitely try this one if you go!"}
{"text":"WOW!!!! I don't know where to begin with my review.  I will first share that we used to LOVE this place and were regulars.  It has been our ONLY go to dinner spot with our family for the past year.  In the past two visits, I will say that I will not be back due to the rude, insulting, and total lack of customer respect behavior of the staff, including the management.  Two weeks ago, I called over a week ahead, to make a reservation for a larger party of 8, two of which were here from out of the country and foodies who WANTED TO GO TO CRAFT 64, because they had read about it.  I called and told the staff this story, and was told , and I quote, \" I'm sorry but we don't take reservations for parties over 8.\"  Excuse me??? I have been there multiple times and seen large tables reserved with sineage MARKING larger tables for large parties.  I then ask to speak to a manager.  The idiot on the phone then tells me that my request has been \"declined\" by the owner, because it's spring trainig and they won't hold any tables.  OK....fine...so I ask to speak again to owner.  The person I spoke to told me his name was Steven.  Remeber this...He told me to call back at 4 on Friday, and ask for him, as he started work at 4 adn he would make sure we had a table.  

Friday I call back ...I am told \"sorry but we have been booked out for the week.   ????????WTF???  I'm sorry??? I was told a week ago when I called that you DON'T take reservations for large parties ????  The person I spoke with was clueless to anythign and just told me they didnt' know what to say, but that they were booked via reservations that had no restriction to party size, as I was lied to earlier in the week.   I asked to speak to a manager again.  This time, I am told the complete opposite as to what I was lied to earlier in the week. \"I'm sorry m'aam , we only take reservations for parties 8 and over , and we have been booked all week.  Excuse me??????? I called on Monday, was told NO reservations were being accepted, and the guy acted like I was crazy for suggesting this????  I then asked to speak to Stephen...and was only given a manager.  The manager tried to lie to me further, while trying to cover up for the previous lies his idiot and uninformed staff had told me earlier in the week, and said he wuold try to accomodate us.  I told him, as i did tonight, that we have a baby!!!! I cannot stand around and wait for table for an hour.  That is why for a week, I had been trying to try and reserve a table!!!!  They finally accomodates us...but reminded us that we needed to be done by 7pm for a RESERVATION????????/  These people have zero concept of customer service or proper respect for paying customers.  It's impressive !!!!!

Fast forward to tonight...We show up at 630pm, restaurant is half full...front patio empty with 6+ empty high tops.  I ask for a seat and they say wait is 20 min.  I accept and ask if we can eat on patio...becasue we have a baby.  I am told no, sorry, we are not serving out there tonight.  They assure me a table on the busy back patio would be opening soon and it was ours.  I then said that I had a fussy baby and it wold be better for all the customers out on back patio if we sat on the FRONT patio, away from diners trying to enjoy a nice meal in peace.  10 minutes pass...a party of 8 walk in.  I watch in awe as they are happily seated on the OUTSIDE patio I just asked to be served on....and handed menus!!!!! WOW...Apparenlty they don't want my money???  Just the party of 8 who is a better tab????   I then went inside immediately and demanded to know why they were being served on the patio that I was just told was not in service this evening.  I was then told that it was \"Just approved\" by the manager.  WOW....

I am completely feeling insulted by an \" entitled\" restaurant owner/manager at this point, seeing the reality of his business model, based on my two separate and very revealing visits in the past month. The only staff member of this restaurant that continues to gain my respect is a manager, Roger,  who was leaving with his wife as we walked in ...he recognized us, came over and shook our hands and said hello....and he has always been accommodating to us on all visits.  He says he doesn't work thursday but we were welcome to come back Friday and he would be there working for us.   Roger is awesome and we love him and his great personality, but sadly the other managers do not share his charm.

In the end, Craft 64 has taken a very sharp turn from great neighborhood spot for a family bike ride, to insulting and dishonest and uninformed staff misleading customer type of establishment.  All I wanted was an HONEST answer when trying to plan my dinner reservation and instead was lied to...on the front end and on the back end!!!! 

We will NOT be back to this establishment....I will NOT support disrespectful managementu who shun customers who have to date,  spend A LOT of money at their business...you are not worth my time!!!!"}
{"text":"Came back again on our most recent visit to Scottsdale!  Really enjoyed my beer again, the recommendation of the server was spot-on!  Tried the Fico and Blanco this time and both were really yummy.  

Try the Sonoran White Chocolate Ale.  Really yummy and smooth. Their selection of beers is really great - lots of unique flavors.  Everyone seemed happy with their selection.

The only complaint - we ordered an appetizer and it never came.  We asked our server and she basically said that she forgot and didn't offer to get another one going for us.  We already had our food when she told us this so we just forgot it but it was kind of uncool that she didn't try to make it right or offer an apology.  Otherwise, two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I came here for a lunch meeting today because I had heard great things and was eager to try it! 

First, I must start out by saying that the food was good and you can tell that it is fresh. So for that, give this place a shot. I also noticed that they have a good happy hour, so it is maybe be worth checking that out as well. 

However, a few things happened that I was a little bummed about! I am an iced tea addict and got SO excited when I saw that they had 'craft' iced tea. Unfortunately when I went to order it, they were out! :( Next, I went to order the Farmer's Market salad and they were out of that as well. I settled on the Caprese Salad and the mozzarella was made in house which is VERY impressive, however, it just came with EVOO drizzled on it so it was a little bland. I got up and went and asked for balsamic (because our server didn't come back around for quite some time). My colleague and I split the pepperoni pizza (+ artichokes) and the flavor was amazing but the toppings did kind of slide off when you picked it up because the dough was so thin. But if you fold it, it is easier to eat! I never did get the parmesan that I requested. The final bill for two (no alcohol) including tip was $56. I thought that this was a little pricey for 2 salads, 1 pizza, and 2 Sprites. 

All in all, this place was a-ok. They were busy at lunchtime and only had 1 server so I can see how things were missed and service was a little slow. As I mentioned the food quality is good and it has a great reputation on Yelp so I would give it a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Best bar/restaurant in town!

Delicious hand-crafted cocktails, superb rotating selection of Arizona craft beers on draft. They even have four of their own beers brewed by James that are tasty and award-worthy, particularly the soon-to-be famous Smoove Hoperator. 

All of their food selections are delicious and locally sourced. Some of the best pizza in the valley- Carne pizza with a side of Aji sauce if you like it spicy.

Stop by. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here when it first opened and it was great! The beer selection is amazing and the food is authentic Italian. Their portion sizes are quite large which makes sharing a plate perfect for a beer-filled tummy. 

We've been back a few times since and my only grievance is the snooty attitude the waiters/waitresses have. When we asked for ranch their response was, \"we don't have ranch...you know that's just mayo and powder right?\"

Haha, not when you make it with fresh ingredients! In the voice of Stephanie Tanner: How rude! 

I'd definitely go back to the bar but not for sit-down service."}
{"text":"This was a nice off the beaten path option for pizza and drinks that I probably wouldn't have found on my own if I wasn't looking for Craft 64. I found the atmosphere very laid back as the bartenders and servers were friendly and helpful. After looking over the menu I decided on the pepperoni pizza and the \"64\" mule. While the pizza certainly was good it seemed too pricey for what was offered although I did enjoy their pizza crust greatly.

However, I really liked their \"64\" mule drink! It was definitely stronger than I expected and tasted great especially with my pizza. I can see why this is one of their signature drinks and would consider coming back here for the mules."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon after running some errands. Nice looking casual spot on Main Street in DT Scottsdale. Atmosphere is casual, very laid back. Couple of big screens and patio seating in the back and front.

The owners are behind the bar, and couldn't be a nicer couple. We sat at the bar (always sit at the bar to learn more about a place) and were immediately greeted with a beer and food menu. They have dozens of all local beers on tap (including a few of their own), a few cans, and a full bar, but this place is all about local taps. Plenty of options, but a sampler is available if your not sure.

We only saw pizzas on table as we walked in, so I was set on that. Not so fast...they also have salads, bruschetta, etc, but the sammies caught my eye. They make their own bread for these and we were told they were great. Hard to beat a great sandwich.  I mean, a bad pizza is still okay, but a bad sandwich really sucks. So, we split the Italian. It was excellent and I was pissed that I was talked into splitting it.

We will be back...gotta try the pizza."}
{"text":"We were really hungry when we stopped in Friday evening and decided to take a table outside to avoid the wait for a table inside. We ordered 3 pizzas for our group of 4 and it was plenty. The Margarita was good, the sausage was tasty and I really enjoyed the Blanco. The service was fast, but not rushed. The beer list is comprehensive and our waiter helped us with choosing one. We will return when we are in town again."}
{"text":"My favorite go to beer place in Scottsdale. Awesome beers on tap. Amazing food. Big screen TVs. Never disappoints. Eat and drink here! Nuff said."}
{"text":"Ben answered the phone when I inquired about a reservation. He was very accommodating because we were from out of town which made us select Craft 64. Abbie was our server. She was very engaging and made us feel comfortable right away. The Pizza and charcuterie platter were perfect. Pizza was thin and very flavorful. The house wines were above average. We enjoyed the whole experience."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and great atmosphere! We will be back, assuming we can find parking."}
{"text":"Craft 64 is great! Chris, our waiter, seemed like he had enough passion to be the owner of the place. Love to see that. He not only explained the menu options, but gave us a little background on how all of the ingredients are sourced. A+ on service.

Craft has a wide selection of beers on tap. For an appetizer, we started with the caprese salad which tasted very fresh. We ordered the blanco pizza and added prosciutto. Wow, absolutely delicious. You can tell that the dough was homemade and all of the ingredients were fresh. Highly recommend stoping in if you are in the area."}
{"text":"AMAZING tap list, and the best pizza I've had in the Valley. My new favorite place in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Looking for an unbelievable, wood-fired pizza? Check out Craft 64. A group of friends and I shared the Spain and Fico and loved them both (although the sweet hint added by the fig spread gave the Fico a slight edge in the votes). To top it off, both pizzas were delivered in record speed.

The relaxed atmosphere and lovely patio, coupled with local AZ craft beer selection and delicious food is one I'm looking forward to enjoying again."}
{"text":"Nice small place in Old Town.  The pizza is very good.  I love the one with prosciutto and fig.  The second time we also had a salad to share.  I don't remember the name, but it was delicious.  I had a couple of different beers from their brewery and they were good.  The place seems fun and the service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great pizza and interesting drink selection!
I had the carne pizza and loved that the pepperoni was crispy!"}
{"text":"This place is terrific
I have taken several people there and everyone has left happy
Best salads in town and the Italian sandwich is to die for plus the staff is a kick
Nice to have a great neighborhood \"joint\" where everyone knows your name"}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome! If you want amazing food, great drinks and fun staff, this is your place. Make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great ambiance and great service!  Our waitress was awesome and very attentive and our food came out quick! We will definitely come again! Made our special event memorable!"}
{"text":"I love the cozy, casual atmosphere at Craft 64. It's on Main and next door to The House Brasserie ***ADORE that place!*** Craft 64 has that fun Scottsdale restaurant/ bar vibe without being too packed and hectic on a Friday night. The staff was really welcoming and our server Cara gave us great service and recommendations. 

We came during happy hour which had a decent selection. Tried the charcuterie board. It was just \"okay\". I think overall it was lacking and not worth $8. Definitely not enough bread. It needed something sweet like a jam spread and the olive oil alone was not enough.. Add some vinegar to that b! 

The Fico pizza caught our eye. (If you have ever been to Federal Pizza in Phoenix, they have a Casanova pizza, which is similar in ingredients to the Fico. I absolutely love the Casanova and decided to test the Fico out and compare the two.) The Fico is very sweet so adding something salty like bacon is definitely recommended. Even with the added bacon it was still too sweet for my liking. It needs something bitter to compliment the sweetness of the fig. So Federal's Casanova still wins my heart. 

There's plenty more menu exploring to be done here. I will be back to try the signature mules and their broad selection of beers."}
{"text":"Best pizza place I've ever been to in AZ!! Great service!!! Great beer!! Great environment!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a margarita pizza. Definitely not impressed. Where is the cheese?! The crust was done well, but it was the greasiest margarita pizza I've ever had. While I enjoy light sauce, it was dry, likely due to the non-existent cheese. Bruschetta had the same problem, one cube of mozzarella per slice of bread, but the slices were cut in half. Tiny table made it hard to maneuver. Ambience was fine, patio was cute, but food just wasn't worth the cost."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and beer joint.  (Full bar). Wonderful craft beer and craft pizza.   Don't overlook this place.  Great patio in back.  Staff is helpful and friendly"}
{"text":"Right off the bat this place was a winner! We were welcomed in with a happy smile and a (happy) comment about our Sf Giants hat. We did a beer flight which is also a happy adventure and got the Aji pizza. So yummy. If we lived  closer this would be a regular stop for sure!"}
{"text":"Charcuterie board was underwealming. It had maybe three different cheeses, a small cup of olives, only two different meats and random blueberries. It was not anywhere close to being worth the ~$16.00 we paid. 

The pizzas lacked any flavor which was incredibly disappointing. We got the margerhita and Blanco pizza. Both seemed very one dimensional taste wise and the margerhita had the tiniest bit of sauce you could barely taste."}
{"text":"The second time i went was just for dinner with friends. Again, not impressed. Their pizza crust was slightly burnt, and our server Cara was just rude and unaccommodating. Other people had tasters and I had 2 other servers giving guests tasters, on a Friday night at 7pm, but Cara said it was too busy for the bartender to do it. Just kind of rude and lazy in my opinion. Will not be going back. I can go to Pomo for good pizza and service.

My biggest issue was with the inconsistent customer service. I totally get that the bartenders are too busy on weekend nights to do flights, but then shouldn't everyone be given the same explanation? Why were we the one table of three in the area that couldn't get the beer flight accommodation? I 100% respect a policy, but just felt like Cara didn't want to bother explaining or trying to accommodate.

PS- I'll take you up on the challenge anytime ;)"}
{"text":"This place Rocks. Good local ingredients in the food and 36 Local beers..."}
{"text":"Yelp once again did me right! This place is a hidden jem. Small yet so much character. The food and service was top notch."}
{"text":"What a great spot. Was in Phoenix for work and tried out this place for dinner. Yummy, fresh ingredients. Great dough, beautiful salads. Awesome service. Great wune selection. I visited in February and it was absolutely perfect weather to sit outside. Fun you can bring your dogs, too. Wish I lived closer because I would be a regular."}
{"text":"The service here left me nearly speechless. The guys said his name 3 times in less than 2 minuets and talked so fast we couldn't even understand what he was saying. We are avid craft beer drinkers and he was talking down to us and acting like we knew nothing. The food was too high priced and not kid friendly. 

The beer was mediocre at best. Too many other good spots for beer in the area. 

Don't go here."}
{"text":"The pizza and beer were great and the staff was pleasant. But do not go there without a reservation as you may not get a seat. We walked over from VH and were able to order a pizza and growler and leave in 1/2 hour. No seats but quick service."}
{"text":"Lunch and a craft brew after arriving in Scottsdale. A great way to start our trip. The service was a bit slow to start likely due to the somewhat limited staff on hand for the number of people in the place. That's the only reason for 4 stars. Hubby had the BLT, unique take on the sandwich and generous portion. We started with the olive plate. I had the kale salad without cheese (only vegan option I could find).  Both of our meals and the app were were delicious and flavorful. Beer selection was fantastic. The Crafty Blonde ale was nice and light, perfect for the hot afternoon. Hubby had an IPA and said it was very good...did not disappoint. Overall a great place to pop in for a bite and a cold brew!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Amazing local beers and pizzas. Lovely people who engage with patrons. A must visit place if you are in Old Town."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite spots now!  Pizzetta and charcuterie board are pretty good deals at happy hour.  Wasn't a huge fan of the Nutella calzone, though it sounded really good.  Maybe with a lighter or slightly sweetened dough it might be better?  Really great beer selection and love the casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"The pizza here was amazing! We got the Spain pizza and it had great flavor. I wanted to order another pizza after having it just to taste one of the others. I will definitely be going back! The beer was also awesome. They had a huge list of craft beers. They also had a cute back patio we sat in. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Damn this place is good. Haven't tasted a pizza near this good since Portland - and this was better. So ok, best damn pizza ever! 
Beer selection & knowledge behind the bar second to none. Well done folks."}
{"text":"I was so excited to check this place out after seeing many of the great reviews...and really what isn't to love about beer and pizza?  We made a reservation (which wasn't needed) and grabbed a spot on the pet friendly patio.  All was going well until another table was seated with a really large dog who was not nearly as well mannered as our pampered pooch.  They crowded their table and dog into ours to stay in the shade and honestly made our experience not that great.

The service was really friendly, the AZ beer list was impressive and the atmosphere was really nice too inside and out.  I ended up with a cider I have never tried from Wisconsin - Cider Boys apple pineapple cider...yummy!  We shared a sausage pizza and honestly were underwhelmed.  I guess we are just spoiled with all of the amazing pizza in our neighborhood from Pizzeria Bianco, Pomo, La Piazza, Cibo etc.  

I gave Craft 64 the benefit of the doubt with 4 stars, but really it's more of a 3 1/2 star experience."}
{"text":"Driven by this place many times for work. Finally got a chance to try one of the pies and I have to be completely honest. I struggle with ever going somewhere else for a pizza. The pie tasted amazing! The pepperoni and sausage tasted fresh and delicious. The crust was crispy but not burnt and the sauce was perfect. I am not much of a beer person but it looks like they have some great options for this that need something like that to go with their food. 

The service here was great as well, very friendly staffs they also have a dog friendly patio, I didn't bring my pup but I am tempted to next time I come by. 

Highly recommend to anyone looking for a great place to eat a nice tasty pie."}
{"text":"I am a self proclaimed beer snob. I like beer and I know when beer isn't good. I also love pizza. This place has both beer and pizza, so naturally I had to try it. 

It is just slightly off of the main area of Old Town Scottsdale. It appears to be in an old house that has been converted into a restaurant. A very cozy atmosphere and almost makes it feel like you're being welcomed into a friends home. The seating is kind of like a cafe with a bar and small tables that can easily be moved together for larger parties. They also have a patio area with umbrellas; perfect for their weekend brunches.

They have 36 beers on tap that are exclusively from Arizona. That is something I think that puts them on top of the beer scene. The variety of beer is also extensive. Double IPAs, Coffee Stouts, Fruit Beers and more, plus they have cans and bottles of items that aren't local, in case you want something new and exciting.

The bartenders were very friendly and had tons of knowledge about each beer. And not just \"its hoppy\" or \"its heavy\", they actually knew about the origin of the hops, how they differ from other hops in different regions and were obviously passionate about the beers. Aside from their knowledge, they are very friendly and don't just treat you like a customer. 

Now, onto the food. If you don't already know, the pizza chef comes from Pizzeria Bianco. Obviously, the presumption is that the pies will be out of this world. AND THEY ARE. We ordered the Spain and the Fico. They are both very. very different in tastes, but are both delicious as well. If you like a salty and traditional tasting pizza, go for the Spain. I say traditional in a very loose way, because the taste is like nothing you have ever had before. The Fico is a sweeter pie, but still has the savory notes because of the crust. 

Overall, I feel like this is one of the best things to open in Scottsdale this year. It's perfect for travelers that don't like the atmosphere of the other Scottsdale restaurants, and great for locals because they are the only place in a few mile radius that will fill growlers. I highly recommend this if you're looking for something new, want to feel like you actually matter at a restaurant and want some incredible, hand tossed pizza."}
{"text":"I just got back from lunch at Craft 64.  Love it!  Decor is really nice (some gorgeous oak tables and an awesome wine case) and the restaurant is open and airy.  Cool patio.  My Scottsdale Blond beer was very light and tasty.  The Kale salad and carne pizza were outstanding.  You've gotta try this place.  Such nice restaurant staff- nothing pretentious here!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  Very friendly and accommodating staff.  Ambience is comfortable and cool.  Cocktails and beer were awesome, loved the margarita, and the Spain pizza.  But best was the special pizza of the day, smoked pork, caramelized onions, heaven.  The pizza was creative and very tasty!"}
{"text":"With a great selection of locally beers and a family ambience this bar is a truly neighborhood bar.  Owners are here working and having a great time in a family setting serving us free food on Christmas Day."}
{"text":"Holy Cows Milk! They make their own mozzarella here and their own beer! With one of the friendliest/speediest staff I have experienced in a while, you are sure to be able to pick from 1 of the 30 local AZ craft beers in no time. You will be sipping and crunching away. 

For $9 we enjoyed a Kale salad with seasonal fruit (sliced pear) topped with pumpkin dressing, Craisens ,pumpkin seeds, butter lettuce, rainbow Kale and Parmigiana Reggiani. Next up was the Blanco Pizza - for $11 (and added onions for $3) - their fresh mozzarella, burrata, spinach, garlic and onions. Perfect crunchy thin pizza but with a thicker outer, softer crust. My favorite. 

I was too busy working and eating to notice the music and they had free wi-fi (pretty good speed). A few TVs overhead if you are a sports nut. It does get busy so get there early or you may have to wait a bit. Again, they are fast with the food, Fues (beer) and check!

Not a fancy place but fun! Bring the kids for a bite but good for co-workers or a loved one. Just go and have a great pizza and fancy beer!

{"text":"Great date spot! All local produce n meat. Sit at the bar, they'll drop some knowledge."}
{"text":"This is a great little place with an extensive menu of local beers, really great pizza and salads and a remarkably friendly staff."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza.. rivals CHRIS Bianco's place for best in the valley... wood fired pies with top notch ingredients and crust that pizza dreams are made of. Must try."}
{"text":"Great little gem stuffed into a great location in Scottsdale so far food is amazing kinda garlic but total yum!!!!!! Glad we found this place right by our house even better"}
{"text":"Excellent service the bruschetta was amazing and nice selection of local beers. If I lived closer would frequent often"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the valley! Service is great and they treat you like family. They have great cocktails/beers and excellent food with wonderful staff. What else could you need!?"}
{"text":"If you are looking for great food and amazing craft beer list, this is the place. Amazing service to boot. Don't be afraid to ask questions either. They will take care of you! 

Be sure to try the Spain Pizza or any of the specials. If you aren't sure about the beer, they are some of the most knowledgeable in all of the valley."}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious- ambiance is great. Only reason not 5 stars is service is spotty.  Sometimes they check on you every two minutes and then no one comes by for 20. Small tables makes it hard because pizzas are large and the water glasses are huge. Definitely a go to for a great wood fired pizza with unique combinations!"}
{"text":"We loved our experience here. Came once I read the article in the Phx Mag. It was busy but we got in right away - table for 4. :)
We ordered the margarita pizza for the girls and what drew me to this restaurant, the Ají. 
Neither pizza disappointed!! The girls ate every slice (minus 2 from dad lol) and needless to say the Aji was deliciously different & enjoyable. 
Had lemon mojito & hunny porter - delish!
The service matched the food - excellent.
Kids got their pizza first so we got to really enjoy our food since they weren't cranky from waiting & took their time. We were checked on frequently by our server and other staff & simply friendly.
Can't wait to come back :)"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by our hotel staff. It was fantastic, the service was fast and friendly. Order the Coconut Pineapple Mule. Incredible. The pizza was equally as good."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza and wood fired sandwiches in town. The beer and wine menu is fantastic and service is always great. The back patio is charming and we have always enjoyed our visits here. I HIGHLY recommend the BLT focaccia and the Craft 64 Blonde Ale. 10 out of 10 for Craft 64!"}
{"text":"Great charcuterie board!  Their pizza is also quite good.  I love their beer selection and also the ambiance.  My boyfriend and I can actually hear each other, yet enjoy the music.  
When it is cool the patio is awesome.  It is dog friendly as well."}
{"text":"So in the last 72 hours I've been to the House Brasserie, the mission and Citizen public house... and this was the most fun and arguably the best meal I've had. They really do make a great pie! The beer selection is almost overwhelming, but that's where a great server comes in. Chris made the night memorable and enjoyable. His energy and enthusiasm was contagious and fun! Can't wait to return for round two if the Caprese salad, Spain pizza and then Nutella pizza dessert!"}
{"text":"A small and intimate setting that suits both a first date and/or a beer with the guys. Outdoor and indoor seating available. Craft 64 has an excellent rotation of local brews. Liquor, wine and specialty cocktails are also available. The menu is simple but appealing and the staff is personable and knowledgable about their menu.  Wood fired pizzas are the focus point, but salads/apps/sandwiches are offered as well!"}
{"text":"Work in progress!!!

I found this place a few days after it opened, and even though a lot of work has gone into this place over the last 8 or 9 months, there are still things to be finished. 

Notably is the draft beer system, its not yet up to full speed, but it has promise, and these guys are pretty serious about there suds so there is plenty to look fwd to.

We didn't stop in out of hunger, it was more curiosity and some buzz on the streets, but The Pizza I did try was fantastic. I had the Blanco with burata and spinach. The simplicity of this pie proves, less is more. If I closed my eyes it would be hard to convince me that this pizza didn't come from Mozza, Delfina or The Parlor! it was that great!

Service was exceptional, friendly and attentive, It felt like somewhere I would want to return soon, and I will.

Once this place catches on it looks like its going to be great, really great and that is mostly based on taste alone! credit for heart and potential, and It's in my hood so that's great too!"}
{"text":"DO NOT ADD INGREDIENTS TO YOUR PIZZA....It is not worth the extra price. 

I went there on a Friday with some friends and had a few beers and ordered a pizza. The reason I am giving it 2 stars is for the beer selection. They had a lot local craft beers on tap. I had 2 by Huss Brewing Co. That I really liked. Now on to  the pizza, I ordered a vegan pizza with Kalamata  olives. I am glad they have a non dairy alternative on the menu, the crust was good. But when I added the olives to the pizza I got 5 cut in half, most prices had one half of an olive. WTF. I expected more than that, waste of three dollars."}
{"text":"Excellent staff and they make the dough themselves for their pizza. All beers are are AZ brewed and they have a great selection of IPAs."}
{"text":"Wish this place existed in Ohio so we could visit more often!! It has one of the best pizzas that my husband and I have ever had!! My husband absolutely loved his Craft 64 brew (Crafty Blonde) and I enjoyed a free tea compliments of an online coupon. We ordered the cap caprese salad (highly recommend!), which had their mozzarella which they make daily. My husband doesn't even like tomatoes but he absolutely loved this app! We also met the owner and brewer, who was very friendly and knowledgeable. This is an absolutely fantastic small business. Loved the food, atmosphere, and hard work!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday. They were very accommodating for our large group and made the reservation process easy. In a really cool old home converted into a restaurant. Very nice atmosphere. The pizza is phenomenal."}
{"text":"A friend and I were off to Jackson Barrett Auto Auction the next day so we just wanted something light. The place is small, quaint and unpretentious. A good place to bring a date or a few friends to have a brew. A place with a lot of locals. A small menu, the emphasis is beer and a few items done well. Usually when you think of beer you think of wings, in this case nothing. No worries, we had the charcuterie board (pepperoni, salami, cheddar & nuts) as an appetizer ($10). We had a simple the wood fired pepperoni pizza - good - nothing I'd say was amazing ($18). Yes, some places do make an amazing pizza. Our waiter was very cool and  helpful with our brew selections. If I lived in the area I'd become a regular too."}
{"text":"Wine bar & excellent pizzeria = heaven! Wonderful Thin crust pizzas, great wine list including Coravin pours of rare Arizona wines, a reserve list at great prices and great selection of craft beers. 
Best pizza I have had in a long time 
Ex chef from world class Bianco I am told"}
{"text":"All beers on draft are local Arizona brews with a great selection! Happy hour is $1 off all beers and $7 pizzeletta or caprese sandwich. The Chef used to work at Pizzeria Bianco (amazing for those of you that don't know) so the pizza is a must order! The patio is a great size if you'd like to have a small party and the service is always attentive!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the 4 house beers we tried and an extra staff for truly being dog friendly. Yes, Alley is allowed indoors but we wanted to try the dog friendly patio.  One of the owners greeted us and showed us how to access the patio at our request.  He said he loves dogs and has his own at home.  In addition to greeting Alley with a bowl of cool, refreshing ice water, he put up an umbrella for shade. 

The back patio is accessible through the back parking lot.  Dennis was great at checking on us during our stay and answered all our questions.  

Alley gives the patio 2 paws up.  She enjoyed sunning herself while watching for new customers.  There is plenty of space between tables so pups aren't crowded.  The bathrooms are also located on the patio which makes this a truly pet friendly establishment since you can drink alone and not worry about how to use the bathroom with your dog needing to stay on the patio. 

We had a flight of 4 beers.  Both IPAs were good with minimal back taste.  Mr. Big, their cucumber wheat, is a summer day treat, refreshing without a heavy cucumber taste.  The one down side is there were only 6 house beers and we would have liked to see more. 

Keep up the good work.  Alley will be back :-)"}
{"text":"Such a disappointment. Just drove across town to enjoy this place. Called ahead and was told 45 minute wait. Got here 40 minutes later and there are probably a dozen parties still ahead of mine. So many waiting they could not even tell me how much longer it would be. Bar was so busy we couldn't get close to have a drink and wait. Nice staff but they should have been more realistic with wait time. Also really small and loud. Will probably try again another time but only on a deader day."}
{"text":"Margarita pizza with prosciutto is the way to go! Great wine selection as well!! We have gone to Craft 64 multiple times and have never been disappointed. Great staff, food, and wine/beer selection which makes this an easy choice for dinner when wine tasting in Old Town?"}
{"text":"I am big fan and this place is less than a few miles from me. They have an excellent beer selection and really great board options. They have a good patio out back if it's not to hot. Highly recommend this spot if you're on this side of Scottsdale Rd."}
{"text":"TONS of potential but the truth is that they are not ready for prime time and I am S-T-R-E-T-C-H-I-N-G this review up to a positive three stars just because they are new.

This is a very small restaurant offers lots of craft beers, a very good wine list, gourmet pizzas and salads. 

They use mostly local ingredients, they bake their own bread, pull their own cheese and the chef controls the minerals in the water for the correct taste. The staff is the most friendly staff I ever came across anywhere and every single person was engaging with us.

We started with a lovely sounding kale and pear salad to share. When it arrived it looked sort of pretty but at the time I couldn't remember all the ingredients it was suppose to have in it. I just thought I read the menu wrong at the time.

It turned out to be missing not one, not Two, BUT THREE ingredients at least. (not sure if I actually got the creamy pumpkin dressing?)

That means-

#1- the prep person preparing the salad might not have been trained in what goes into it. 

#2- the server wasn't trained in what he was serving and wasn't aware the salad was incomplete.

I thought one of the two pizzas was very good and it was the pizza with the fig sauce, three cheeses and arugula. No complaints with that pizza the Fico was very good. 

I'm not sure if the Blanco was made right, seemed like something was missing.

Growing pains

2.5 stars

I do note we did call the restaurant before I wrote this on Yelp and let them know about my experience. They did offer me a correctly made free salad but I'm unable to travel there this week since it's very far from me."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! Indoor and outdoor seating. Dog friendly patio which is awesome. Over 35 different types of beers available and all local which I love! James and Susanna the owners are wonderful people!! Such hard workers and their staff are hard working as well. They are friendly and professional and knowledgeable and very welcoming. They have great TVs for watching sports. I had the BLT which was delicious!! Next time I am in town I will definitely come back. Recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Good service. Expensive food. Ok pizza. If you're a beer drinker you have to try the coffee beer! I loved it!"}
{"text":"Tried to go here the day after Christmas at 3:50 pm for cocktails. Party of 4. We walked into the restaurant, and saw 2 people at the bar, and perhaps 4 other tables occupied, 1 inside, the others outside. Pizza was coming out of the kitchen. After standing at the host area for a few minutes, a waitress (?) called over to us from the other side of the restaurant stating we'd need to wait \"10-15 minutes\" for a table. We were quite surprised, to say the least. There were at least 10 open tables, and most of the bar was open. As we were processing this, we heard the waitress tell the guy behind the bar that another waitress wouldn't be there for 10 minutes. We were not offered the option of being seated, nor directly told why we would need to wait in a mostly empty restaurant. After several minutes just standing there, we walked out, never to return. Lots and lots of other options for cocktails in the area. What horrible customer service!!! Rude!!!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is amazingly good (love that they try to keep all ingredients local!) and their beer selection is legit. Definitely a fun date spot!! (Only reason for 4 stars was the vegetarian options were a bit lacking)"}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza place in Scottsdale. Great selection of beers. The staff is always nice and great place for locals during the off season."}
{"text":"A gem in the downtown area. Lovely ambience, great collection of beers and wines, and tremendous food. A regular here now."}
{"text":"We were staying in Scottsdale for the weekend and were looking for something for lunch. Craft 64 was within walking distance of our hotel (Hotel Valley Ho) and they had a welcoming facade (not to mention positive reviews from some of the people we talked to).

Inside is very cute, with a nice bar on one side of the room, tables on the other. Their wood-fired pizza is a big item here, so we had the Fico (Fresh Mozzarella, Buratta, Parmigiano Reggiano, Truffle Oil, Arugula and Fig Sauce). This was an amazing pizza with a nice thin crust. To drink I had a local item - a Cartel Session Pale Ale. (Cartel is a micro-brewery based out of Tempe). There are lots of good local craft selections here.

I'd like to come back a few more times but this is a good contender for 5 stars. If you need to beat the Scottsdale heat, try Craft 64."}
{"text":"Love this place! The pizza is as delicious as everyone says. It's wood fired and the crust is SO GOOD. We ordered a classic margherita and could really taste the freshness of all the ingredients.

The cheesy garlic bread is also a hit. The fresh basil really takes it to the next level.

Now let's talk beers! They have something for everyone! Craft 64 has their own beer alongside tens of other local breweries. The bartenders and servers are also super knowledgeable and can help even the pickiest drinkers find something they like. I tried the Wheat the People Raspberry and the Blueberry Milkshake and was impressed by both.

Craft 64 is a great place to sit outside, sip a few new beers and enjoy a delicious meal. I can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Some of the most delicious pizza I have ever tasted. Everything we have ordered here has been amazing. I think they grow all of the ingredients themselves, I'll check next time, but the food is phenomenal. The crust is thin, so you never feel greasy or overly full- just satisfied. We have tried the Aji, Fico, Pepperoni and Sausage, and they were all delicious. Their beer selection and wine selection is really vast which makes is a great place for everyone because people typically like one or the other. The atmosphere is great- it's quite cozy, the bar is small and they have a community table right across it. The seating outside is nice too. I've seen a lot of different kinds of crowds here- couples, groups, families, young, old, middle-aged....dogs lol. My only qualm would be their happy hour menu, which I think they need to expand. I don't think any of the pizzas are on the happy hour menu, and I think the beer and wine selection is also very limited. 
With that said though, the quality of the food and beer and wine selection make this one of my favorite places to eat in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and a great selection of local craft beers. Did not make it in time for happy hour but the prices for it are also great. Keith was our server and was very tentative and nice. Would definitely return here again!"}
{"text":"This review is more personal so my apologies to most it would not bother the turn of events but you were not there, Unfortunately this rude lady, while I was sitting at the bar, decides to kick the chair next to mine hits my seat what to me looked like it was on purpose while she laughs I push the chair back to her and \"apologizes\"  turns out she is the owner because  she told me, \"good thing I'm the owner of this place\" she knew I was a bit upset I didn't comment, anyways James who is owner and bar tender for the night was more Profesional nice place tried the mozzarella caprese it was delicious they have a good product this night I didn't try the pizza but will be back. So on a personal experience 1 star...you had to be there. Food I'll start at 4 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of beer!  Lots of local selections and they rotate often.  The owners (husband/wife team) were outstanding and clearly are having fun each day.  Highly recommended for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a really good Italian pizza this is the place!  We ate a late dinner here and the place was crowded, but we'd had no problem getting a table and great service .  We ordered a mushroom pizza and the crust was perfect, light and airy.  The atmosphere was lively and our server was courteous and made some great suggestions."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The pizza we had was amazing. Probably the best I ever had (I got the Carne pizza but added prosciutto, must try). The staff is attentive. Has tons of beers and local beers. Will be going again now that I know about this place!"}
{"text":"We found Craft 64 on Yelp being avid craft brew fans and recent transplants from OR to AZ. We were immediately welcomed by Joseph. He treated us like family and had amazing recommendations. We casually mentioned it is our anniversary as well. We had fantastic brews after sampling a couple of the Craft offerings. My fave being the house made Wheat the People. My hubby tried the Mango Pucker and wow! If you want your salivary glands to kick in, try this beer. We had an amazing caprese  salad and I had the BLT while my hubby had the Italian. The mozzarella is house made fresh daily as is the focaccia. So rich, so creamy, so delicious!! We can't wait to come back again and try the pizza. After eating, the server and manager brought us 2 glasses of champagne and house made tiramisu. We were just blown away. I wish every place had this experience. Go here. Seriously, it's awesome. We will absolutely be back!! Thank you again Joseph and manager whose name we didn't get."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend. This place has a wide variety of beers. The staff is very knowledgeable about there selection. Did not try the food. But was a fun place to grab a drink and a good enviornment ! Will most likely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a first class operation. The beer specialist is a Ciserone and Josh (A funny FN third level somellier) is very knowledgeable on the insights and pairings of wines. 

The mozzarella is hand pulled with love and a special ingredients.  The staff are friendly and the first seven handles are their own hand crafted delights. 

The remaining handles are all Arizona based with a plethora of choices. The pizzas are wood fired with awesome crust. I highly encourage you to try this out...

{"text":"Excellent and regularly rotating selection of quality Arizona craft beers, very good thin crust pizza with chewy, tasty dough, this is enough to make it a go-to spot for me when in the area.
On Main in Scottsdale, a few doors west of Goldwater so it's out of the art gallery cancer. Parking is pretty good.
Bar about 15-20' long, view through the wall into the kitchen where the chef is constantly whipping up food, sometimes talking through the window to James behind the bar about something tasty sounding but off-menu (Last one was carne asada pizza with cebolla and cilantro). Both indoor and outdoor table seating."}
{"text":"Great food, incredible service, and a carefully thought out collection of local beer. Simply put, better pizza in Scottsdale, or in the valley for that matter, does NOT exist. Each visit has been better than the last. Kudos Craft 64, you are a breath of fresh air."}
{"text":"So I finally got into King James place of business, and I had a pretty nice time, I must say. I didn't eat any food, but I did try all of the house beers, and a few others for good measure.
The house beers were decent, nothing spectacular, but well made and good enough for this craft beer lover. Some were better than others, but all were again decent.
Service was fine, the BT was knowledgeable about the beers on tap, and he was attentive and friendly. Additional staff seemed to be happy in their work, and seemed to be adept at taking care of their customers. 
There is a patio area out back which is a nice place to enjoy a beer in the evening after the sun goes down and it cools down a bit, my only complaint was that the table nearest the restrooms is kind of in the way when a customer chooses to sit at the end of the table which sits in the pathway to the restroom.
Overall this was a fun place to have some craft beer, and though I didn't have any food, it looked good, and smelled delicious. Definitely worth a stop in if you're in Old Town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Craft 64 on my way home. I sat on the back patio. They were very attentive making sure I was comfortable while outside. I had a pizza and wine. The pizza flavor was delicious I just wish their crust was a little thicker."}
{"text":"A work happy hour at a new place? yes! what started as a small group of about 10 turned into overtaking nearly the entire back patio. The happy hour deals are great...1$ off all the beers on their enormous draft list. and they have individual pizzas for 8 bucks. They are small, wood fired tasty bites of goodness to go with the list of nearly all local beers. 

But what stands out primarily about this place is the service. We had one server, a UK gentleman. He was phenomenal. He kept water filled, beer flowing, and food coming. And we never had to wait. Huge bonus...and he didn't have to do this...he kept everyone's order separate...all separate checks. He essentially remembered 25 different checks. Add to that, he was friendly the whole time!

Bookmarked and will go back for sure!!!!!!"}
{"text":"When Yelp shows 4 1/2 stars with almost 300 reviews, I'm usually up for giving it a try. Didn't take long to see why Craft 64 had hit this mark. Fresh food, loads of choices for beer, good service."}
{"text":"After reading so much buzz about this place, I was anxious to try to place.
I went after the lunch crowd but before the happy hour and dinner crowd. 
So while it was kinda quiet, I have to say that I like this place! They have a reasonable size dining room, a good size bar and a dog friendly patio!
They have 64 beers on tap with 35 being from AZ. Thanks for supporting local brews.
I ordered the Margarita pizza and was pleased to learn that their \"Pizza Chief\" used to make the pizzas at Pizzeria Bianco! It was fantastic and no waiting!
Great place. Will be back."}
{"text":"The three stars I am giving Craft 64 is based off a few things. The quality of the food is good here from the pizza to the salads. They have a great take on a BLT, it's a very good sandwich. I've had a variety of Pepperoni pizza over the years. This Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, tomato sauce, with Basil pizza here was good. I like the basic ingredients of the pizza. With large pieces of Pepperoni on a smaller pie expect it to be a bit greasy. They loaded the pizza up heavily with Pepperoni which I'm sure some people love. I was hoping to taste more of the Basil and Reggiano cheese in my bites. The sauce was not amazing it seemed to be pretty standard. I wonder if it's homemade or canned. The $18 dollar cost for this pizza seems to be expected because of the Scottsdale location and the wood fired cooking method. I would have expected better flavors. I could have saved myself a trip and went to MOD Pizza and got something comparable for around $10. The main reason I removed stars from this review was I witnessed the bartender in his glasses and backwards hat. Scratch the inside of his nose before handling glasses of beer, and food! This was an immediate disappointment. He also used multiple variations of sentences with the F word during my dining experience over and over again. I get it, I'm at the bar but still it's not necessary with family's dining in the restaurant. I wish Craft 64 continued success since most people seem to have a great experience based off their other reviews!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I think I can be a little bit of a pizza snob  because I love it so much, & this place def made it up there w/ some of my favorites! We ordered the Uovo (a white pizza w/various cheeses, thick sliced, flavorful bacon, eggs over medium topped with spinach) & a house salad. They brought out the Carne Lover's by mistake but our kind server said we could just enjoy it on the house & still brought out the other out too. Both were delicious  We actually enjoyed the carne one a lil better. My hubby enjoyed the local craft beers too. Another server (possibly the manager?), Brian Wilson, introduced himself & apologized, even offering a free porter on the house. He was hilarious, serenading us & the other customers with a bit of song & dance. So the next time we're back here, we'll def revisit Craft 64!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and atmosphere in addition to fantastic service.  We didn't order food but it looks amazing."}
{"text":"Great food, epically the pizza! Beer selection is awesome along with great staff and service. Plenty of tvs to catch any game you want and enjoy a locally brewed beer along with it!"}
{"text":"The beer list is all AZ craft beer and for those who don't drink beer, there is a wine list. They are true to farm to table and the fresh ingredients combined with the wood fire pizza is great! We had the Aji pizza which is spicy but tastes really great with the spinach. Great atmosphere and the perfect spot to take a break from your busy day and enjoy craft beer."}
{"text":"Yeah, the beer brought me here but shit you will freak on the wine list and everything else :) a great place,  we will be regulars here.."}
{"text":"Beer selection is outstanding and you cannot best the local flair on the food menu. Everything is local sourced and tasty."}
{"text":"I don't usually leave reviews after one experience but i felt that this awesome experience warranted a 5 star review. Both service and food were impeccable! Their beer and wine list is extensive and the cocktail list looks fun, although we stuck to beer and wine. We had the charcuterie board on happy hour and for $8 it was seriously impressive - a super flavorful olive oil with bread, two delicious cheeses (sharp cheddar and Gouda), salami, pepperoni, grapes, and trail mix. All ingredients were artisan and not something cheap/store bought. Our server was JOSH, and he was amazing!!! I had the happy hour house Chardonnay to start and then he suggested a Sonoma Chardonnay I might like after that... Husband had two different craft beers and we both agreed that the list of available craft beers was extensive. Josh was extremely attentive and present without \"hovering\", which was exactly what we were looking for. A VERY solid 5 stars, and pushed this place to the top of our list for places for happy hour. 

UPDATE: 2 years later, this has become one of our go-to favorite restaurants. The food seems like it just keeps getting better and better, and their beer/wine list is always extensive with interesting new things to try. The service is honestly the best service in the city, the staff and management really seem to be invested in the place and it makes it such a pleasant experience every time we go. Can't say enough good things!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza...wonderful craft beer.  Locally sourced.  Excellent service.  Nice patio area."}
{"text":"This is such a totally cute place!! They carried tons of Az draft bees only, which is nice.  I had the strawberry blonde, very good.  Happy Hour menu was good, an we all ate off of that. We also had the Carne Pizza, awsome. They were pretty busy in there for Monday, which the waiter explained an was apologetic about the service, only him plus the bartender, so it was slow, but don't let it stop you from trying it!"}
{"text":"Great local beer selection, wonderful pizzas, and Chris is the man.  He is a legend, actually. Our server is an act of a Devine force.  The manager or host boy was actually pretty rude to us, but Chris made up for it in sheer splendor. We love Chris, and we just met him. You be you, Chris!"}
{"text":"First trip to Craft 64 was a happy hour stop on a Monday evening. Can't remember the bartenders name but he was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. The restaurant was quite busy for a Monday night. This is a great spot for couples like us, where one prefers wine and the other beer. Both lists were great and happy hour prices didn't hurt! The beer list was heavy (if not all!?) on AZ beers. I the craft 64 IPA to start and it was solid. We were heading to dinner elsewhere so we just ordered a board with some very good quality meats and cheeses. We have a great new spot for happy hour and more!"}
{"text":"Craft 64 was more than I expected!

We went on a Sunday and they have Happy Hour until 7p so we took advantage. Their wine options are great and they only serve local brews. The BEST local brews, I might add.

My parents had pizza and they were amazing wood-fired pizzas (One was Margarita with Prosciutto and one was just the Happy Hour pizza with pepperoni.) and I had the Caprese sandwich. The ingredients were fresh and the bread to the sandwich was killer! 

Our server was a tall guy and unfortunately since I don't remember his name, I can't give him the shout-out that I'd like to give him, but he took great care of us and not only will I be back, I'm bringing all of my friends too."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, great service, and decent wine for my honey. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is soggy! They don't seem to care.  I am not sure the bartender got my drink right. Seems like the place is not what it once was. Or what it wants to be... Could be..."}
{"text":"Place had a great beer selection and they have a nice patio front and back. It's off the beaten path though and it wasn't very busy. I did like the 12oz pours. Food looked amazing but didn't try it."}
{"text":"Craft64 keeps getting better and better.  They now have over thirty taps of different Arizona beers!  Because they have developed deep relationships with local brewers you are able to try beers that no other restaurants have to offer and many times are only available at the brewery tasting rooms.

The pizza and service is as good or better than you'll find anywhere in town.

Well done Craft64!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a bite to eat early last Saturday afternoon, and were immediately greeted and seated by one of the owners. The restaurant is housed in a cute old house and has a nice little patio out back.
Beer selection is really nice, and it's all local AZ craft, with a few more rare varieties. There is also a fairly extensive wine list. Happy hour includes both drink and food specials.
The menu is a nice size, made up of a handful appetizers and salads, and around 7 specialty pizzas. You can also build your own. Let me tell you, the pizzas are amazing! Wood fired, chewy crust, and all of the fresh flavor you expect from a pro (the chef hails from Pizzeria Bianco). 
We truly enjoyed a lovely afternoon there with great food, great service, and great beer. Can't ask for much more than that!"}
{"text":"Ok, we have been here several times and the pizzas are great!  The Marguerite, the Fico, the sausage and the pepperoni are all top notch!  The Fico with prosciutto and fig sauce has delightful sweet taste with arugula and parmesan  shaved cheese...woo, there it is!
The do have a great selection of craft beer that changes frequently keeping your craft beer taste buds alert to a new taste.  Tonight the manager, Andrew Jadyn, who doubles as a outstanding musician has awoken my taste buds with a coffee beer (Huss  koffee kolsch, new to the menu) that is not as heavy as a dark ale coffee.  Outstanding!  The wait staff is efficient and friendly.  No wonder this place is always packed.  When Andrew works he may give you a sample of his favorite craft beer and turn you on to something new.  Great great place!"}
{"text":"Came out during the soft launch - food was top notch - nice to see all local beers featured on tap (just a few for now, soon to be 36).

The back patio was great for a relaxing early dinner - the staff was friendly and attentive.

Will definitely return (already picked out the next pizza I want to order, even)."}
{"text":"Walked 2 blocks in the scottsdale summer weather to eat the caprese salad recommended by a friend.   It was worth the skin melting stroll.Delish! 
Met one of the owners \"James\".  Make sure you speak to him and guess where he is from! 
Loved the atmosphere. ..was originally a home built in the 1930's.
36 beers on tap!!!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I came here with some fellow coworkers after a staff event back in December. The waiters were awesome but the pizzas left a little something to be desired. Don't get me wrong, I understand that it is a wood oven pizza et al, but each pizza should not be burnt right? That is not normal is it? Or is my knowledge of wood oven pizza way off? The Margarita, Sausage and the Pepperoni all were good pizzas if you got past the burnt part. It is also very thin (which I know is the norm) but some were made a little too thin maybe? Like I said the staff were great so mad kudos to them. I may come back again and give it another try as maybe it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"I want to start out by saying thank you to my friend Sama, she is the one that instigated my first trip today. I had the pleasure to sit down and have a good chat with one of the co owners; which Scott was very polite, professional and personable. This place is a must, why, well because you can get wine, craft beer of course, and hard liquor, so there is a little bit for everyone here. I got pizza which was fantastic and I heard through the grapevine that their ingredients are locally organically derived.

Cheers to Scott, Cory and the rest of the owners and people who work at CRAFT 64! Much success to you all. You sure will see me here again, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. Found Craft 64 while walking around Old Town.
We were seat immediately by a very friendly host. Our server was very attentive and explained the different craft beers they had available, plenty to choose from and something for everyone.
We ordered the pizza, which was fantastic! The pizza came piping hot, with crisp crust, not burnt, the cheese had a wonderful flavor and my husband said the meat toppings were some of the best he's had.
Definitely one of our new favorites."}
{"text":"The ambiance is OK music is playing but with people talking you can't hear much.  The pizza was soggy and not very flavorful.  the prices were high I would rather go to federal pizza or even fired pies for a better pizza at a better price point."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends for my birthday and we had a great time!

Our server was entertaining, friendly, attentive, and outright awesome. He made sure we were taken care of all night. 

We ordered cheesy bread from the happy hour menu to start off the night, and I ordered a glass of the red blend. Then we all ordered a bunch of pizzas to share. I chose the onion/pepper/mushroom pizza and added spicy soppressata. One of my favorite pizzas of all time is their Fico, which has fig jam, parmesan, ricotta, arugula, and truffle. mmm....

Their pizzas have an irresistible charred crust that I cannot get enough of. 

It was my birthday celebration, and their birthday \"dessert\" is a glass of bubbly for everyone at the table. How can you go wrong!? He even brought a glass of ginger beer (non-alcoholic) for my pregnant friend and her daughter. I mean... just make your reservation now."}
{"text":"Gotta give Craft 64 some Love.

We were there on the day that they opened for business and although you could tell it was their first day, they were definitely on top of their game.

Great and friendly service with a nice dining room and a small (we'll call it cozy) back patio.

The food:

I had a pizza and my wife had a salad.
( I would have had salad too except .... well, there was pizza available on the menu)

My pizza was prepared perfectly and although I've never been one to overeat (pfffft) I had all but one slice in this sitting.

The pizzas are big enough to share; mine had six slices. Again, prepared just right.

The salad looked and tasted great ( my wife made me take a bite of the salad, something about needing leafy greens in one's diet...... whatever. )

The beer menu was not extensive but offered a fair collection and we were told that \"more are on the way\" .   The menu  features hometown beers, which is nice too, right?   I'm not much of a drinker.... but with this kind of a menu, I'm willing to learn.


Will we be back?  Without a doubt.
Regulars?   ..... maybe so.


Again, this review was based on their very first day of business so you gotta believe that they will continue to impress."}
{"text":"We went for a fairly early dinner on a weekend.   The restaurant was very busy and noisy!   Service was friendly, casual and efficient.     We loved the Caprese Salad (fresh made mozzarella - so good!) and the pizzas were excellent.  We had the Margarita, and the daily pizza special - Lemon Haze  (my husband would love to try to duplicate this one).     We also tried the dessert special (peach tart with mascarpone and Nutella).   The waiter told us they were getting mixed reviews but I am a sucker for a good pie so I couldn't pass it up.   We gave our feedback which they were happy to hear (filling was good but crust needed work) and they comped the dessert.   We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I met here with a group of friends in a Meetup Group. The atmosphere is relaxing, the service is good, the inside is cozy, and there's two patios one on the front and the back. The only con is that the glass my beer was not clean.  Large selection of local beers and wines delicious apitizers. I'm sure I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night with a Scottsdale \"local.\"  He told me how to find the place and to be honest, I probably wouldn't have gone in if I was just walking by.  There is nothing special about the outside and kind of set back from the sidewalk, but the inside is AWESOME!!!  I was immediately greeted by two friendly faces as I walked in, and another friendly introduction followed from the bartender.  I wish I caught the bartender's name...?  All I know is that we had exceptional service, the food recommendations he made were AMAZING and I will DEFINITELY be going back!!!!!!!  GREAT FOOD, GREAT SERVICE - don't walk by - GO IN AND GIVE IT A TRY!!!! For the \"foodies\" out there, it's off the hook!!!"}
{"text":"Very simple. Get the Aji Pizza and you will be happy for the rest of your life. Craft64 has some great beer too. I just had their local IPA and am a happy boy. This might be more of a local find but totally worth coming to for out of town guests."}
{"text":"Food was great. Welcome was sketchy. Six tables empty and was told they were all reserved for 5:30.  We were given the option to sit at one of them, order and eat quickly - but we had to be done before the 5:30 reservations. This was at 4 pm.  We opted to take our chance and eat. Again, the food was delicious. Service was poor. Didn't get checked on by the waitress once.  And it was quite the show watching customers come in and get the same story - we have reservations and you can sit and eat but you have to be done in 60, 40 .... etc minutes. Then the staff would stand at the counter and talk about people they just seated. How do I know? - the waiter would say something and scowl and the other two would turn and look over at the table and shake their head. The kitchen servers would get the food out timely and pleasantly.  The food and ingredients were fresh and hot. Suggestions:  take the business when you have it, lose the song and dance of reservations.  Put an awning out front to utilize those community tables, even when it sprinkles."}
{"text":"Friendly well informed server, good pizza, tasty salad, excellent choice of beers, well priced. What's not to like....."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch today for my first time. It's near Scottsdale's Arts District. I will return when I'm back in The Valley. Met Roger, the owner, who was most hospitable. I had a Caprese sandwich that came with a little bowl of mixed olives. The sandwich mozarella was same day made and the ingredients were very fresh and tasty. I had one of the Craft 64 branded drafts and it was an above average IPA. The restaurant has art on the walls and a neighborhood joint vibe, in a good way. Nice classic rock playing. I was able to park on the street. The restaurant parking lot is tiny."}
{"text":"Just arrived this afternoon and was looking for a simple lunch/snack and good beer luckily we found it here! Walking distance from our hotel was a plus. Hubby had a peanut butter dark beer that was delicious and we shared a pretty awesome pepperoni pizza. I know that sounds easy, but we've all had ok pizza, everything worked perfectly for us.
Highly recommend this place for good craft beers on tap, easy going atmosphere and staff that know their business well."}
{"text":"\"That moment when you go in somewhere craving something, and get EXACTLY what you wanted\".... this was my 4th time and it only gets better! James and the chef were amazing, almost as good as the pizza! Ask for their jalapeño sauce. Yesssssss, I'm craving more already"}
{"text":"So pizza has never quite been my thing until my taste buds came across Craft 64s! The fig, caramelised onions and cheese pizza was an instant hit. Then the fennel sausage pizza...simply a perfect  balance of flavours. We were 3 dinners and 2 pizzas was ample. I chose to have a Perry Cider with my slices. The perfect choice for my palette! Joseph (or Jose) was our server and he took great care in making sure we were enjoying ourself. His knowledge of wines and beers was most impressive. He was truly passionate about what he was doing. All the draft beer is local and my Perry Cider came from Prescott. I couldn't fault a thing. Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"What's up yelpers, put down that frozen burrito and put on that nice winter coat of yours cuz your going out for pizza tonight. And I'm not talking about no dominos, I'm talking about some out of your ordinary bomb ass pizza. Egg and bacon on my pizza, uhhh yes please. Fig jam and fresh mozzarella, ummmm yes I'll have two. In addition to those delicious pies, put those rosy lips around some top notch craft beers, brewed both in house and locally. So jingle your bells and head on down..."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's great to have such a nice place in the neighborhood to go get good food & great beers. I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys pizza, good beers & wine!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Decent service. My mom and I came here and our server was ok, kind of cut us off at points and was a little rude. Near the end of our meal when we were looking for the check, he was sitting and eating with another guy and they were chatting it up. Our food was ok, we shared the blanco pizza and the spinach on it looked like it just got tossed on there with some olive oil. I wouldn't return just because there are so many other nicer places in Scottsdale to get pizza and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Excellent food, beer and service.  I found this place on yelp and was glad I did.  All good is sourced as locally as possible, the mozzarella had been made that morning, and several beers are brewed down the street.

The server recommended the Aji pizza and it was a generous serving and spicy.  I had a raspberry wheat beer and it was really good, not tasting syrupy at all.  Service was fast, friendly and attentive.  

I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends and was pleasantly surprised. The pizza is outstanding!  Wood-fired with great flavor combinations. You won't be disappointed by the menu. They also have a great beer selection, 7 of which are brewed onsite. Finally, the staff were so friendly!  This is a must try location the next time you are craving a beer + pizza!"}
{"text":"Amazing! These guys are top notch! They treated us like gold and we had an amazing lunch. Kids loved it!!"}
{"text":"I have been here at least a dozen times and this is by far the best pizza place in Scottsdale. Their brick oven pizza is great, they have awesome menu selections and their specials are always interesting. If they ever have the Pesto Pizza on special you have to get. They have 35 beer taps, 100% Arizona beers and they are constantly rotated. If you want a Coors go somewhere else. If you are overwhelmed by the beer selection, ask someone. The staff is super nice and always willing to suggest something new to try. They will fill growlers and they have a great happy our from 4 to 7pm. If you are looking for the best craft beer selection in Old Town this is it."}
{"text":"Tried this place with a group of friends after looking for a happy hour on a Saturday night. Not easy to find. Craft 64 exceeded our expectations! The beer was fabulous. Everybody tried something different and was happy. The seasonal mule was fantastic! We shared the olive plate which was yummy. They even brought us more of the delicious bread. The focaccia caprese sandwich and the caprese salad were both delicious as was the pizza. Portions were very large and the price was great. Good vibe too although it got a little loud as the night went on. Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"The Fico pizza with prosciutto is the best!!  Great selection of beer, wine and spirits, well done!"}
{"text":"Friendly ice atmosphere.   Beers are flowing...64 to be exact.  The pizza is delicious as well as cheese bread. The owners are friendly.  Make sure to visit if you're nearby.  We'll be back next year,  it's our yearly visit"}
{"text":"My first time visiting Craft 64, but it won't be my last. The staff was friendly and personable. My wife and shared the Caprese salad and the BLT. The mozzarella is made fresh daily which made the salad so good. Also the tomatoes were freshly cut and topped with fresh basil strips. As for the BLT, there was drag made mozzarella there as well.  The bacon was perfect!  In addition the selections of beers were appealing. I had the dunkle. After having spent time in Germany, it was freaking to have a change from the popularity of IPAs. It was smith and went well with the food."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing addition to the beer scene in Old Town.  My hubby and I came in during lunch  and they had a Pizza and beer special going on.  I was incredibly impressed with the local beer selection.  My husband's favorite AZ beer is Sacred Beast from Beast Brewing and they had it on tap there.  My hubby was in heaven!  I was also pleased to try some beers from Flagstaff breweries that I hadn't tried yet, like Wanderlust Brewing.  

The pizza is an authentic wood fired and delicious.  We shared a peperoni and onion pizza and it was right up there with what Pomo makes."}
{"text":"Pizza service and beer are very good!! Nice beer selection 36 taps...... Keep working
On your menu and selections....so far so good"}
{"text":"Ran out for a quick bite and ended up having an amazing dinner experience. Must try is a beer sampler
As they have so many delicious AZ brews to choose from! The salad was perfect and our server Andreas and the bartender were beyond hospitable as we were the last people to order right before closing. 5 stars all the way!!! Would definitely be a regular if I lived here."}
{"text":"Lovely bistro with extensive local craft beer offerings and wine list. BLT sandwich is one of the best (OK, THE best) I've ever had!!  Amazing staff comfortable lovely decor and two patios!  In a place with lots of restaurant options, don't miss this one!!"}
{"text":"one of my all time faves - beer list is impressive and all AZ brews - food is amazing, service is always friendly and relaxed."}
{"text":"Tons of beers on tap, including a bunch of Arizona brews, and the menu is well written. The pizza is delicious and appears homemade(you can watch them make the dough). This place lives up to the hype.

I'd say my only criticisms are price and the facility. The beers are priced well but the food is a little steep and so are the mixed drinks. $10 for a mule? Really? Then again, it's high quality and you're paying the Snotsdale oontz tax, so it's to be expected, I guess. I don't hold this against them. And the facility, yes, someone previously said it was \"cozy\", which is a kind way of saying it's small. I don't have a problem with small places for size sake, but since this is a typical bar with a lot of hard surfaces that reflect sound well, it's doesn't take but one or two loud talkers in a place this size and you can't hear yourself think. We would have stayed longer but, a couple loud, obnoxious broads sitting behind us brought our visit to an early conclusion. Again, I don't fault Craft for this one either, but it is an annoyance.

We'll definitely be back. I love the local aspect of this place. Well done."}
{"text":"I recently stopped in craft 64 on my birthday.  I was looking to try some new craft beers...what I found was a gem of an establishment.  I was greeted by James, who quickly explained that they carried 30 local Arizona craft beers, 6 of which were their own crafts.  He went on to explain that they offered wood oven pizza with mozarella cheese made the same day ( can't get fresher than that).  After a few crafts, I decided to bring my daughter back to have dinner.  The freshly made pizza was incredible!  The service was prompt and our server a delight.  They even brought us Champaign for my birthday!  If you love craft beer, excellent pizza and amazing service, you need to go here!  Thanks again, James... I'll be back.  You can count on it."}
{"text":"While walking through old town Scottsdale with my parents, we wanted something to eat, but needed a place with beer on tap. It seemed every place we looked for either didn't have beer on tap, didn't have decent service, was too loud, or didn't have much in the way of food. Craft 64 was the best of all options. It was quiet, we got to sit outside (and turn on the heaters when we got chilled), there were not only so many beers on tap, but we didn't run into \"oh, that's been changed out already\" line that a lot of restaurants pull. Our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and quick with service. I've already thought about going back! The food was great, dessert was great, beer was great, and not a single aspect of the atmosphere took away from time spent visiting with my parents. I'd highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Gosh - it's so hard to not give Craft 64 5stars!!! The food is amazing...pizza, caprese salad, the beer!!!!  However, the women's bathroom was not only dirty(2 toilets - neither of which was flushed) but    in a scary place.  You have to go out back by the alley. As mentioned, we will return for the food....just will make sure I don't have to use the women's bathroom!"}
{"text":"Real good pizza and better staff! I had the Carne pizza and it was a little salty but I believe that's the flavor of the spicy sausage they use, but it was light and really flavorful. Also, the iced tea of the day was delicious as well, red berry mango. I like pizza places that are unique and this fits the bill!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, beer and wine but made infinitely better by our waiter, Dennis.  Fabulous recommendations, fun personality, he was super fun and should really own the place.  Highly recommended and ask for Dennis' table!"}
{"text":"Craft 64 has great food but it is a bit pricey.  We came with our supper club group and we got a pre-set menu/price of 25.00 pp but I didn't think we got a great deal.  
So, there was 4 at each table=100.00 
38.00 -2 pizza's say 18.00/20.00 a piece one with pepperoni/sausage and mushrooms the 2nd pizza was all veggie
10.00 -1 caprese
12.00 -1 salad - Farmers Market salad 
10.00 -1 Charcuterie board
$70.00 TOTAL per table

I had 2 glasses of wine and we came prior to 7pm which I didn't realize Happy Hour was from 4pm-7pm and no mention of happy hour and I was charged 12.00 a piece for my wine.

My husband got 2 craft beers at 7.00 a piece again no mention of happy hour where we could of gotten one drink each during happy hour. 

So for 2 of us our bill came out $94.73 without gratitude.  We left a 20.00 tip so grand total of $114.73. 

We sat outside in the patio nice lighting plenty of heaters but nothing really special as we sat in the corner so the ambiance there I was not impressed.  The caprese and farmers market salad was really good.  The pizza were thin crust and pretty good we like our choices with the meat etc.  

I think it's safe to say....we probably will not be back UNLESS we win the lottery."}
{"text":"I think I am starting to hand out 5 stars like m&ms on Halloween but seriously, I have eaten at several restaurants lately that are exceptional and Craft 64 is one of them.  We stayed the night at the Hotel Valley Ho  in Scottsdale, AR. We decided to eat out late in the evening and the concierge recommend \"64\".  First, the beer selection is amazing. I'm sure you will find a flavor you like.  My wife had no. 29 a Sonoran Fresh Raspberry Ale and I had no. 30 Wanderlust Pan Am Vanilla Stout Nitro and both were very good.  As for dinner, we ordered bruschetta, and a pepperoni pizza -- both of them were very tasty. But the Italian sandwich stole the show. This is a sandwich like no other and a must have if you eat here. The atmosphere was loud but I think that's because most people are drinking lots of beer. Yet no one was obnoxious. The decorum is nice but still casual. We didn't even get to the gargantuan wine selection so if you like wine I am sure you will find your bottle.  Needless to say, you must try this place if you are going to stay in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great selection of rotating taps. Each time I've been here it has been something new to explore. Today we will try food and let you know."}
{"text":"Craft 64 never disappoints, the service is always above expectations.  Their pizzas are the best around.  Eat there once a week and I have NEVER been disappointed.  James behind the bar and Roger are some top notch owners and treat people right!"}
{"text":"James...thanks for the champagne for our 14th anniversary and 2nd annual trip to Scottsdale! Love your beer, pizza, and hospitality! Amazing and just our style!"}
{"text":"I cannot imagine patronizing a drinking establishment where you cannot trust the servers. 
You should feel relaxed and comfortable where you dine, mood can be even more important than the food--which, here, at least judging by what we ate, is overrated.

Things were busy when we came in and we were invited to wait for a table at the bar. Ok. When it came time for our table, someone other than the bartender rang us up, did not present us with a bill, but gave too little change, we were overcharged. We disputed the bar tab, I pointed out the only way the tab could be so high was if we had been charged over 25% tax on our drinks, and was told the register at the bar did the tax differently -huh?!!- At which point the maitre'd came over, put an arm on my shoulder and told me if we still wanted our table, for which we had waited over thirty minutes, we must rush to it now.

Well, after explaining the issue to our server at dinner service, we were reassured to hear he'd square it, only he our server came back after an interval and said since it was one of the owners tending bar he wasn't about to bring up an overcharge with him.

With whom should an employee prefer to bring up such a topic as an overcharge, who could be better to discuss that with than an owner?! 
What's wrong with this picture?
Yes in retrospect that would have been a good time to leave, it continues...

At dinner, our dinner server did not bring her what she ordered, he chose to bring her something different, assuring her as he put down a drink by her place at the table that she would like his selection, and if not?--he would bring her the other.
She did not like the server's choice and asked for the drink she had ordered. 
If you guessed that both the unordered drink the server picked out and the drink she had ordered showed up on our bill, you are correct.

What kind of stupid do they take us for?"}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection, excellent staff! We had the Carne pizza and it was amazing. Pizza was done to perfection and one of the owners took the time to sit and talk with us about the recently opened establishment. Big upgrade from the French linen shop :) We are from Gilbert and wish we had a place like this in the area!!! Great experience."}
{"text":"The beer and food here was ok...but why I wouldn't go back is cuz we knew we left a money clip with some money on the table we seat at and hours later we call their and they say nothing was found! Someone took it!!! Normally I wouldn't care but that money clip was a gift I gave my bf!! So upset! What happen to honest people?? Smh"}
{"text":"Five is tough... but we couldn't find anything wrong w it! 
So. 
CLEAN! 
Absolutely DELICIOUS
Awesome BEER
super friendly staff!!! 

We are originally from Jersey/NYC... pizza? We know pizza. This pizza is AWESOME!!!! drive RIGHT PASSED Grimaldis (you can have that anywhere) and head HERE!  Ignore the curb appeal *only thing we felt was somewhat lacking* and GET YOUR HINEY in one of these seats!  

Our favorites? 
Mascarpone and fig bruschetta
Aji pie
Carne pie
Sausage pie

Yes. We had them ALL! no leftovers! 

This place is AWESOME! 
*so so clean, too*"}
{"text":"This review is WAY too late. While visiting Old Town during a weekday afternoon, we were hard pressed to find quality restaurants that were open for lunch. 

We stumbled across Craft 64 at the end of our walk. I honestly thought twice about it as I was not sure if it would be the best spot for my kiddo. 

As we were about to walk away, a group of ladies were just leaving the restaurant and were like \"ARE YOU LEAVING?? You REALLY need to go check it out!\" We chatted with them for awhile and they reassured me my kiddo would enjoy it. The ladies convinced us. Lol. 

Our waiter (who I think was one of the owners) was absolutely awesome! He was knowledgeable about the menu and beers (as Wisco people, we do appreciate a good beer.) 

The food was fresh and hit the spot, but five stars definitely goes toward the customer service. When we were hesitant about what to order our son (we did not want to buy a full pepperoni pizza just for him,) the waiter offered to make him a kid-sized pizza, to his delight!

We left Craft 64 full and pleased. When we return to PHX, we shall be back!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best pizza in Scottsdale. I also like it for the unpretentious, casual  atmosphere, which can be hard to come by in Scottsdale. The service is for sure some of the best I've had. Staff is so friendly and makes a conscience effort to make all patrons feel truly cared for. You can tell that they really value each and every person who gives them business. When I first went there it was still somewhat of a hidden gem, but now they seem consistently busy. Good for them! They really do work to earn the business of their patrons and you feel it every time you go there."}
{"text":"Great food, service, & atmosphere! Next time we are in town we will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our beers & food at Craft 64 this weekend. We went Sunday around 1230-1 and were the only people there, by the time we left it was packed. We got 2 beer flights & a pizza and everything was so good! The pepperoni pizza add ricotta was perfect for two people & was very tasty. The beer flights each had 4 beers (2 of their own beers) & we enjoyed almost all of them. The pizzas are a little bit pricey for the size ($12-$18 per pizza). They have two decent sized TV's above the bar & the staff was super friendly. We will be back for sure :-)"}
{"text":"Pizzas are amazing, always a great selection of craft beers and the staff is friendly and attentive. Every time we have come it has been great."}
{"text":"I gotta say I was not impressed with Craft 64. There was a group of 9 of us on a slow Sunday afternoon. We all ordered drinks and food. The waitress could not have cared less that we were there. She was kinda snotty and if anyone hesitated or ordered slowly she seemed really annoyed. 

Some of the food came out better than others. I ordered bruschetta. Every piece was burnt in at least one part. One of my friend's received a burnt pizza as well. 

We all finished our food and waited for our waitress to deliver the check. She never came. Eventually another waiter came by, told us our waitress had left for the day and asked if we needed anything. We were like \"Umm. The check?\"  Then that took another 10 minutes or so to sort out. No wonder our waitress acted like she didn't care, she was just counting the minutes until she could bail!

Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Our server Chris was awesome! Place is small and comfortable! Back patio is the perfect chill spot during a warm afternoon. Huge local beer selection and great wines. Food was satisfying and priced fairly. CHECK IT OUT!"}
{"text":"Over priced for my taste but the pie was pretty, pretty good. You can mos def eat an entire carne pizza to yourself. They have great beer options and don't serve bud light (AMAZING!). Not my fav local pizza joint but better than most main stream chains, just gotta be willing to dish out the cash."}
{"text":"What an amazing and fun pizza joint in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale.  The place has a fun atmosphere and the people are extremely nice and attentive.  This was my first time here and my friend and I started with the a recommended salad called \"Bistro Bacon\".  This was heaven in a bowl.  A lovely arugula salad with real bacon and a light vinaigrette dressing.  Just the perfect amount which was not too heavy and just made the salad sing.  Next, we had a \"Carne Pizza\".  We've heard wondrous praises from other friends who have eaten here and let me tell you, those praises were justified.  There is just nothing better than a hand made pizza crust from a wood fired oven.  This was simply the most scrumptious pizza I've had.  If you are a beer aficionado, the king of craft beers himself (King James Swann) has you covered.  There is so much local beer on tap a generous selection of custom beers he's created to fit anyone's fancy.  Prices here were very reasonable.  An absolute value for your money."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i came here this past Saturday and I absolutely loved this place! They have amazing Arizona beers, one of the owners was extremely nice, friendly and very attentive of his customers. We tried the blanco pizza and it was delicious! And they have happy hour daily which is awesome I feel like you don't find that a lot in AZ (being from California and my BF from Wisconsin we find that odd) so that was a plus for me will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I think this place is in a really good location. Close to the Valley Ho Hotel which was why we decided to try this place. 
First I made a reservation and my first impression was not good. We arrived early because we had a big party and the hostess seemed annoyed. She immediately stated \"well your reservation isn't until 8:5, we will sit you then\". No problem but why the attitude? Better early than late, right? 
We were told this place was good for outdoor seating. The back patio is small and the restroom is back in the patio area. Too close to eat 
There are no gluten free options. I asked for a salad with protein. There are none. When you are gluten free you learn to accommodate with protein. Well the server said everything is fresh. Well that even better, but not even a meatball in a pizza joint? You would think the salad would come first but no the entire table received there pizzas and appetizers before the salad. And when it finally came it was the wrong salad. Nothing is worse than a server who blames the customer. 
Not impressed with staff or menu selection. The table said the pizza was ok. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great local Pizza spot in old town! I have tried the Ajo and Blanco pizzas and both are delicious and flavorful. The garlic bread appetizer is a must! Tried the caprese salad tonight and the fresh moz is great! Happy hour is great for drinks and food. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We met for an early lunch.  The place was pretty quiet until almost one. I tried their wheat beer with the salted caramel for something different. It was interesting, but will try the wheat by itself next time.  

Not a huge menu, but salads, pizza and sandwiches.  I had their BLT, which comes with fresh mozzarella and caramelized onions.  I would have liked a splash of balsamic with that. The bread was vert good. 

Service was fairly slow, but we were not in a hurry either.  

I will come back again to try happy hour with the hubby."}
{"text":"Came here after a glass of wine at a near by tasting room (Lawrence Dunham) where they were highly recommended. The food was good and the beer selection was great. While the wine list was impressive for what they had, the prices were a little high, especially by the glass. Wife had the Bistro Bacon salad which lists a poached egg as an ingredient on the menu. That caught her eye and figured she would give it a try. Whoever wrote the menu descriptions should know that a sliced boiled egg is not a poached egg. I had the Carne pizza, an excellent choice for the meat lovers. I have to agree with the reviewer who commented that you can't lift and fold a slice like a NY pizza, that doesn't take away from the flavor of the pizza. I can live with using a knife and fork for the first bite of a slice.

The pros are:
1. Great wait staff
3. Excellent craft beer list, focusing on AZ craft beers
4. Great pizza and other food
5. Nice wine list (need to add some Arizona wines to the list)

Cons:
1. Very loud environment
2. Menu descriptions should truly reflect what is in the food (Bistro Bacon Salad)
3. Pricey wine especially by the glass"}
{"text":"Crickey!! 

This place is legit. Too legit to quit!

Amazing pizza, craft cocktails and the awesome married duo is PHENOMENAL (pure entertainment)! You simply must stop here on your journey in the valley of the sun!! 

Whether salads (reco the caprese with fresh made mozzarella) or the uber-fresh Za, you will love, love, love this place. 

Finish with the Nutella Banana Calzone - and you will have a ton of Yum!

You will not be sorry with a stop to Craft 64!"}
{"text":"I was super excited when I heard about this place.  The owner coming off some years working for Chris Bianco? A ton of AZ beer on tap? Color me interested!  Stopped by and after perusing the beer menu, was disappointed that the beer selection was definitely skewed towards the hoppy side.  Even both of their wheat offerings were more hoppy than what wheat beers should be.  I know plenty of people like a hoppy taste, but there's PLENTY of that... keep some options open for those who don't, why doncha?  

Anyway, after struggling between the FICO and Aji pizzas, I settled on Aji because it was an unique combination and its not one I would see anywhere else.  Because the Aji uses jalapeños as the base for its sauce, it was spicy.  I thought the spiciness was manageable but due to the small amount of ricotta cheese (I would have liked to see some more), the spiciness eventually overtook the flavor of the pizza.  I also was slightly disappointed not to see any olive oil bottles around because the crust would have been delicious dipped in some olive oil-- kudos to the owner/chef, I liked the pizza dough flavor.

The house sausage was also pretty good- I'm very fussy about sausage- and I wouldn't be opposed to trying another pizza.  Shame about the beer list though.  

Oh, and the pizzas are pretty pricy."}
{"text":"My review is just for the beer selection. I have not had the food and have only sat at the bar. The bartenders are great and know their beer. I had the two they brew and both were awesome. I am an IPA person and they have a great selection. 
A must try and will be back to try out the food but it must be pretty good because every time I'm there its packed. Always a good sign!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice, tried a lot of things. Likes pretty much all of them. The meat pizza was a bit salty, but aren't they all? Their Fresh Farm Salad was one of the best I have had around town, ingredients change from day to day because they are FRESH. But the avocado dressing was wonderful and I could have eaten another whole salad. They have great \"kinda burnt in a good way\" fire roasted pizza, which is why we went and what we loved most. No complaints, plus brought the pup which was nice."}
{"text":"Bam!  Pay attention to this review...I have a first to share with y'all America. 

Tonight, I actually ate my salad and...and...finished it, before, I ate the pie...no lie.  I have a pictures below to prove it!!  

Had a hunch this was going to be a good find and, it was. Saw pics of the chef (I assume) stringing up his own fresh mozzarella...so; no brainier there.  

I went with the Carne pie and a goose salad with a small curve ball - throw on some of that fresh mozzarella and, give me that bacon vinegarette (sp?) - which for the record was deeeelishhh!!  

Cute little place, easy parking (for scottsdale) and quick quick quick.  Everything was delicious - will be bookmarking this puppy for sure!!!"}
{"text":"We went for happy hour on a Saturday.  We didn't have a reservation and the owner/manager was very accommodating, even as the place was bustling, which we appreciated very much.  Pizza was very tasty and I loved the crust.  Ingredients are fresh and apparently local which is cool.  Lots of beers and wine to choose from.  The only nit: It's very LOUD.  Music could have been lowered a notch as the place is echoey, due to concrete floors and high ceilings.  Hard to have a conversation with people at your table but it was happy hour, after all.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious pizzas, awesome selection of Arizona beers, and fantastic service, what more can you ask for!  And at least one of the owners are there at any given time, and they are always helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"We rarely venture into the Old Town area. And honestly, with wood-fired pizza restaurants currently opening up like corner gas stations all over the damned city, the only reason I even took an interest in Craft 64 is because of the chef. Horacio Hernandez runs the kitchen - or at least he did initially. Not so much anymore. If you didn't know, he's the former right-hand man of some dude named Chris, who just so happens to make what many say is the best pizza in the entire country! 

They have a pretty extensive locally crafted beer list, which I'm sure will please many people that are into that scene. It's their gimmick. I don't like beer, so I'll leave those opinions to the craft beer connoisseurs. 

During our first visit, we had their charcuterie board, featuring some bread with olive oil, a couple of cheeses, grapes, nuts, seeds, soppressata and chorizo.  Everything on the plate was very fresh and tasted great. The bread, however, which is free, is pretty standard-fare in comparison and is starkly different than the bread used for the bruchetta. During a return visit, they've modified the board to include a bleu cheese. We asked the server if they could substitute it out due to our mutual hatred of bleu cheese - which our server didn't seem to really understand. He said that's all they had, which kind of made no sense, considering they have a variety of cheeses back their used to make their food. Instead, we ordered the mascarpone and fig paste bruchetta, which was actually one of the best things they offer. 

For pizzas, we've had their margherita (or margarita in their case) as well as a FICO, due to our intense love of either figs and/or fig jam incorporated into a pizza. We requested that they hold off on the truffle oil, which one would think they'd know better. Additionally, we've also tried their Spain, which seems to get rave reviews on Yelp.

Honestly, I don't know. Aside from the chorizo, the Spain tastes kind of bland. The mild harrissa sauce is no substitute for a great tomato sauce. We both agreed that it just kind of lacked any presence or pop. The margherita was decent. However, we both found it strange that their mozzarella had a very sharp, almost cheddar-like aftertaste. I'm not sure why. My girlfriend seemed more put off than I was. Very interesting. The Fico is probably the best of their offerings, as they use a very high quality fig paste. It's good, but sadly, we've seen it done better at other places.

Crust is a bit baffling to me. During the first visit, I felt the crust was very comparable to Bianco in terms of texture and taste. Coming back almost a year later, it tasted far more doughy and not quite what we've become accustomed to. I guess that's what happens when you make changes to the kitchen.

For dessert, we ordered the nutella indulgence. We both love nutella, so this was a default choice. It's okay, although as another reviewer noted, would probably benefit from a scoop of ice cream. I wouldn't quite put it on par with some of my favorite Nutella desserts in the city, as I feel there's way too much going on with all of the combinations they throw in here.  

Overall, I think this place works for what it is. A respectable pizzeria and beer joint that seems to receive a lot of business. While I wouldn't quite rank it up there with some of the best in the city, it's by no means a poor choice. If you've never had this type of pizza before, I'm sure you'll be blown away. But if you're well versed in wood-fired pizzerias in the city, you'll quickly realize that this place kind of just blends in with the rest of them.

Recommended to try out."}
{"text":"Awesome. Great intimate service and very informative of the beers. We were here for lunch and got the special which was terrific. All got our own pizza and beer! Would come back if we were here for longer. We love patronizing local places and small ones that give you undivided attention."}
{"text":"Really nice place. They have great selection of local beers to choose from. Their pizza is well made, using top ingredients. 

The owner sat us down and really cared for our experience. Seem like a place that cares for details, I appreciate that"}
{"text":"Five stars for the Arizona beer selection--seriously, if you're looking for a sampling of the best beers from around the state, clear your schedule for the afternoon and night and go here. There's 40 taps that are all Arizona, and they have at least one or two from each of the more known Arizona breweries. You cannot go wrong with the beer selection here. 

Unfortunately, it's three stars for the food. The pizza can get pretty soggy and it is incredibly salty--it wasn't just the pepperoni or things that are normally salty, it seemed to be the crust, the sauce, and even the cheese. It's been hard to eat the last couple of times I've been, but in the interest of beer drinking I managed somehow. Between the saltiness and the prices--$15-19 for a personal-sized pie--I'd stick to some of the other items on the menu. Just one man's opinion. But seriously, go for the beer. It's top notch."}
{"text":"Unequivocally, absolutely the best pub in town. The best staff, super friendly (Thanks Rodger) and accommodating. A great relaxed atmosphere, where indoors or out, you're accommodated. 

Craft 64 has six homemade brews, each and everyone will make you fall in love, with the beer. It's not miracle juice, it's just good. They also make mules, which are crisp refreshing and perfect for Arizona's arctic weather. 

The food is locally sustainable farm grown Arizona fare. The pizzas are fantastic and so are the sandwiches. I blame the bread and mozzarella which are made in house. 

My best times in Scottsdale were here, I made friends and ate the best pizzas ever."}
{"text":"Great place! Amazing local only wine list. Lengthy beer list. All locally grown food. Pizza's delicious. Owner is down to earth and friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pizza is the best I have ever had!  Being from Seattle and living in California for the last 4 years, and just relocating to Scottsdale, I was told to come here by a co worker.  Hands down the best pizza on the West Coast and the service is just as amazing!  

Great work Craft 64......you'd be an idiot not to try their pizza if you're in town!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I was extremely impressed with the pizza here!!

We ended up getting a Margarita and Carne pizza and everything tasted fresh and delicious. We were especially impressed with the crust - not too thick, not too thin!

The server was SUPER knowledgeable on all the different types of beer and wine. If you like fruity drinks, try the Huss Strawberry Rhubarb Blonde. Lots of craft beers on tap to explore!

This spot is kind of hidden (I never even knew it was there) but for those in the Arcadia area, definitely check it out! Cute patio and great service too! :)"}
{"text":"It gets loud if you dine close to the bar. It's part of the fun!  We like it o fine at the bar if we can get a seat to chat with owners. The pizza is wonderful, my personal fav is the bistro bacon salad. Oh and there is a wide selection of great local craft beer. Not in the mood for beer? Try the wine list, they have Napa wines of course but they also have wine from New Zealand, France, etc."}
{"text":"Great food....pizza, caprese salad, fig prosciutto marscapone bruschetta among my favorites. Incredible beer and wine list. Staff and service is great!"}
{"text":"Beer + Amazing pizza = a winning combination. Honestly I think their pizza is better than Pizzeria Bianco. I've never have had a bad pizza. I especially like that the staff actually can find the perfect beer depending on what you might be feeling. Great vibe inside and their staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"First off, love the beer. Great local beer selection, every time I go in they have something I haven't had before. I like that they give you a water right away at the bar. Seems like you have to ask at most places.

Service - Lacking in this area... While they do make an effort to make small talk, I was given the impression that regulars are served first, everyone else last. 

Example 1 - I just wanted a quick beer after work, I waited over ten minutes for a check. I had to flag down the only bartender (Jake/owner?) more than once to get his attention. He was chatting with a family in the corner the whole time. There were several bus boys just standing there bored, they wanted to help me but couldn't work the register. I know I wasn't the only one waiting / frustrated.

Example 2 - Ordered a pizza with the wife, tried the one with slivered almonds. Got the pizza, almonds were burnt. I asked the bartender if this was normal (never had pizza with almonds), he basically asked the question back to myself with an attitude. We assumed this was normal, pizza was pretty bad. We were hungry, just smiled and left...

I'm torn, again love the beer but keep get disappointed about the service every time. Please start sharing responsibilities, have more than one bartender at happy hour if you know you'll be busy.

I will go back, just with lower expectations."}
{"text":"We can't get enough of this place - which is amazing because we live a block away.  Great neighborhood vibe, friendly service and amazing food!  They serve all local Arizona beers and have added on to serve liquor and wine.  We are so excited this place just celebrated a year in Scottsdale!  Must haves are their breakfast pizza with a runny egg on top, the Fico Pizza and the TO DIE for NUTELLA INDULGENCE!"}
{"text":"Came here a while ago for dinner on the recommendation of a friend and was delighted that we ended up going. Wine bar x beer bar x wood fired pizza. Nice atmosphere.
Food was really good, and the environment was nice.. Met one of the owners who is Australian and talked about wine, particularly Australian wine - he said he was the sommelier.
Had the Caprese salad and a couple of their wood fired pizzas.. Great flavours, homely, traditional = nice.
Over 36 Arizona craft beers in house as well as a pretty nice wine selection.
Definitely a great place to go for happy hour or a super meal!"}
{"text":"Had a sausage pizza. Was very good. A large selection of beers on tap as well. Prices are reasonable for the portion, especially during happy hour!"}
{"text":"I love Craft 64!! I have been coming to this place for about six months and have watched them get busier and busier! The craft beer selection is always changing and always locally brewed. Not to mention, the pizza is amazing! Service is always great and the staff is pretty friendly. I would 10/10 recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Opening night. Amazingly smooth for 1st night. Excellent pizza. Limited but very good beer selection. Taps are all Arizona beers. Nice variety of bottles & cans. Soon to expand to 36 taps. Excellent,  extensive wine selection. Service was friendly , attentive & timely. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened and it keeps getting better and better.  It has become the go to spot for my work happy hours.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Great place for beer especially since they have such a selection of local AZ on tap.  Great staff and good location. Keep it up guys."}
{"text":"Came to this place for a get together before my wedding,  and we had a horrible experience. I dont even know where to start. 
Food was ok i guess you get what you pay for. 
Drinks are good,  the service tho was terrible
Drinks took so long to get to the table, food took forever and our server got the orders wrong. 
Obviously he could not handle a 12 top
And the time to paywas the worst part, we had to wait at least half an hour to close us out and when he came back he got every single item wrong. It was a mess my soon to be wife was so frustrated and so was i. 
We tried to help our server but still kept getting stuff wrong, most of our table work for the industries and we've never seen anything like this. So if you have more than a 2 top i wouldnt recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with this place. I'm visiting the Phoenix area for a few days and was looking for a place to get lunch and beer. I thought the Italian sandwich was delicious and their selection of local beers was excellent. I tried their own brew--the smooove hoperator--and found nicely balanced and very satisfying. Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This just became one of my favorite restaurants! We had a pizza and it was the best I have ever had. Everything is local and fresh and the atmosphere is very warm and welcoming. The list of local beers and cocktails were amazing. We tried a couple of mules and they were some of the best cocktails we have ever had. The staff was so friendly and knowledgeable. We'll definitely be back every single time we're in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Super cool place with amazing pizza! My favorite though was their brie appetizers. I really enjoyed the atmosphere in fact I ended up going 2 nights In a row."}
{"text":"This was a great new addition to the area. We had a fun night with friends here. 8 of us were able to get together and they reserved a great table area for us that wasn't around everyone else so we weren't battling for space or sound.

We got there right before happy hour ended so we got a few drinks and apps. We did everything family style and shared a few salads and pizzas too. We started with a couple charcuterie boards and caprese salads. We had the kale salad and the bistro bacon salad - both delicious. For the pizza, we had the carne, margarita and the pepperoni. We contemplated ordering more, but it was the perfect amount for 8 people. 

Our server was really patient with us and was awesome!"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot!   The interior is cool and open.  The waiting staff top notch.

They have a TON of beers.... many of them local and several that they brew themselves.
Their cucumber beer is our new refreshing summer favorite.  So yummy.

And unlike that other way popular beer hangout place on indian school rd.... this place has top notch food.  We have tried three of their pizzas and they are to die for. Sooooo tasty! ! !

We had passed by this place many times.  The building has Zero curb appeal.... but once inside you will love it.   Maybe this is why it isn't overcrowded like that other place with the not so great food.  So hopefully it will stay a little bit of a secret."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting from California and were looking for a good pizza place. This is most definitely well worth going to. The food is great, wine is great, and so is the beer!"}
{"text":"Huge fan. Huge. I'll edit my post with a link to my restaurant review once it's finished. 

So many amazing things to mention. 

The staff first: it all starts with who you have pushing your brand. Kudos to Craft 64 in who they employed. Knowledgable staff. I threw as many curve ball questions at our server and he was quick to explain things. 

I love how they converted an old 1937 house into such an inviting space. Not taking away from the integrity of the space, they moved the bathrooms to what used to be the carriage house out back. Don't worry. They have renovated the space perfectly. 

Now to the important part... THE BEER! 
Oh my gosh. They gave 36 beers on tap. Of those 36 (and I lost count on how many) you can get various brews in Growler size! So not only can you experience yummy craft beers in their inviting indoor space or outdoor cozy space, you can bring home any of the LOCALLY selected brews. 
Sigh... They had me at growler. 

The prices are reasonable and their happy hour is everyday, yes everyday, from 4-7pm! 

Hidden little happy gem in old town. Can't believe for over a year I haven't known they exist."}
{"text":"What an awesome place.  The waiters were awesome.  The beer was great.  What seemed to be the owner working the reception really worked hard to get us a seat as the place was really busy and we had no reservations.  The pizza was really good and the ambience was second to none.  I recommend without hesitation."}
{"text":"Came in due to the fact I was able to use TapHunter to view the tap list. From the moment I walked in I was impressed. Nice happy hour options, both food and beer. While I didn't try any of the craft 64 brews all of the other local AZ brews I was able to try were great. I tried a beer I wouldn't normally get thanks to the passion and help offered consistently throughout a busy night by Chris. As an added bonus Craft 64 has portable phone chargers, which was a very nice, and impressive. Next time I'm in Arizona I will be sure to stop back in. 
Cheers"}
{"text":"Came here on our first night in Scottsdale. We were seated in the back patio, farthest corner to the right which was perfect for us since we had a toddler. But it was the worst place to get service. We got skipped multiple times. Even people who got seated was served before us. In any case, the manager Chris made it right .  We ordered the garden salad and carne pizza. Both were delicious. 

You can find street parking."}
{"text":"Great pizza, beer selection and atmosphere.  Highly recommend after a hot day at the golf course!!"}
{"text":"My husband is a big craft beer drinker and who isn't a fan of pizza (?), so we were excited to check this place out.  I don't drink beer, but everyone in our group seemed happy with the beer list.  I had wine and felt I had some decent choices available to me.  I was expecting a few local wines on the list, since they seem to have a local theme going on, but there weren't any.  The food was really good!  We sampled three different pizzas and an appetizer and all were really delicious.  What we were all not impressed with was the nutella dessert.  I know that seems to be everyone's fav, but I'd honestly rather just eat nutella out of the jar than eat this again.  Sorry!  The service was great as well.  The real reason for four stars instead of 5 is the decor/atmosphere.  In many ways, it just felt like not a lot of thought or effort was put into the decor.  We walked in feeling like we just entered a Pizza Hut or something (okay, maybe a bit better than that...)."}
{"text":"Ate here last night and this place is terrific. Certainly will return, owners and staff want your business and make you feel welcome. Nice selection of locally crafted beers and very helpful in suggesting which beer is best with your food order."}
{"text":"Service is horrible, food is below average.  There are virtually no choices other than a few pizzas.   The restaurant is so noisy you can't have a conversation. Unless you like beer, do not go here."}
{"text":"We went for Happy Hour.  Craft 64 makes their own fresh mozzarella from curd, bread, and some craft beers. 
We had the charcuterie appetizer and the grilled mozzarella sandwich with arugula and caramelized onions. Both were really tasty!  One of the owners was present. He was very helpful and informed us about the local beers on the menu. Worth checking it out!"}
{"text":"Good: great! Had the carne pizza- added mushroom and caramelized onions. Very hot!
Bruschetta-mascarpone. So delicious! It has salty, savory and sweet. Good mix of texture. 
Farmers market salad: something in it was spicy and bitter. Unsure but it was still taste. 
Craft iced tea was good. I didn't add sweetener. It was a non sweet fruity tea. 

Service: great. Very nice. Everyone was very nice. Hosts were nice when entering and server was very nice and attentive to needs. 

Environment: very chill. Clean. 

Parking: 2 spots in the front, street"}
{"text":"My wife being from New York and now living near New Haven, CT (some of the best pizza in the country), we were doubtful that Craft 64 would live up to the reputation.  While, I don't put their pizza on the same level as some of our favorite pizza joins back east, it certainly didn't disappoint.  Our server was excellent and truly funny.  If you get the 64 oz beers the prices are really cheap but caused us to get a little tipsy by the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Short walk out the front door of the Valley Ho Hotel-  go here for lunch or dinner -  delicious pizza! Fresh made mozzarella on our Aji pizza and a big selection (30?)of local craft beers on tap. Wish this restaurant was in my hometown!"}
{"text":"We can't figure out how we missed this place. We've probably barcycled past it before. Great pizza, great beer, cool space... Waiter was fantastic.

Only thing I'd recommend in the interior is some sound deadening material to absorb the noise. It's pretty noisy when it's busy, at least inside.

Cute little place. Tiny patio out front. Didn't see the one in Back. Quite a bit of space inside. Friendly staff.

We'll be back. It's that time of year in Arizona when the bikes come out and the weather is flawless. It's why we tolerate the summers. Places like Craft 64, with their patios and quaint lighting, make it feel like we're on vacation. Well played, Craft 64!"}
{"text":"How have I not been here!?  Live just north of old town and love pizza.    Very friendly and accommodating staff.   Menu looks amazing.    Our pizza was great (didn't come out super hot only reason not 5 stars)   can't wait to try happy hour and other selections."}
{"text":"Just a block or so from the main touristy area of downtown Scottsdale, this place does three things. And does them well. Number 1, they make a mighty fine wood-fired pizza. We split the Uovo. Delish! Number 2, they craft a fine beer. I tried the winter special and my wife had the house wheat beer. Both were flavorful and not at all heavy. Number 3: splendid customer service. We were in with our daughter and the staff was attentive and kind not just to us, but to her. The restrooms are outside across the patio and it had begun to rain. And the owner lent me has umbrella! I plan to come back again, for certain, the next time I visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Place deserves at least six stars. The concept and environment is awesome. Craft beers and amazing pizza. So many dofferent and unique flavors. The owners are awesome as well as the service. This is my happy hour spot. Ever since the first time trying this place I haven't been able to stop the cravings lol. Will comeback time and time again"}
{"text":"Craft 64 is a great place to try local AZ beer. They have 36 beers on tap and have a handful of their own brews on tap as well. I found the staff to be very knowledgeable and very friendly. Both owners came and talked to us and made sure we were satisfied. Our waitress (can't remember her name) was the wife of one of the owners and took great care of us. I was visiting from out of town and the people at Craft 64 made us feel welcome and like local regulars. We didn't try any of the food but it looked delicious and there were some amazing smells wafting around. If your looking for a place to try AZ beer in Scottsdale this is it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from the outside, and if you don't know what you're looking for it'd be hard to find (the only signage on the exterior is a small \"64\" and \"Open\" sign -- they'd be well served to put signage that at least hints at the amazing craft beer and food inside!). 

Once inside you'll find a fun, sophisticated (yet casual enough), friendly, delicious, and even surprising (in terms of beer selection mainly) pub. 

Staff extremely good at what they do. Plenty of samples offered, attentive all around. 

The pizza I'd say is good, not great. Pretty light on the toppings. 

Patio is great, which you'd never know from the outside. 

Prices are a little on the high side, but you're in Scottsdale so forgivable. 

Wish they stayed open later. Maybe with better signage more people would know about it and they'd be forced to serve a late night food and beer crowd!"}
{"text":"A good variety of really high-quality, good food with some local / house-made ingredients, and friendly low-key staff make for a great, relaxed experience.  One word of caution: beware the Aji pizza, it's really good but also really hot with jalepeno oil -- I was warned but I got it anyway, and man did I pay for that for ~12 hours!  It's a small, inauspicious venue that's tastefully set up ... (owners, please don't change this and try to 'go big').  I'll surely go back when I'm next in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Had the margarita pizza with cherry wood bacon...the freshness and flavors took me back to Italy!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely more for beer or wine rather than a food place. There were more pages with  alcohol than food. We ordered the cheese board and the plain bruschetta with just the tomato and cheese. The cheese board was very good & the olive oil you can tell is good quality. The bruschetta was okay. We got the margarita pizza & lacked in flavor & the cheese was VERY stringy. They didn't have ranch which I like to have with my pizza. This place was just okay."}
{"text":"fig pizza. Great ambience. Excellent service. Not many words needed for this one, give it a try and love it."}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday dinner in honor of one of my girlfriends. As soon as I walked in, I noticed that the ambiance was very homey and warm feeling, and it was obvious that they take wine very seriously, since there were bottles stored and on display everywhere. 
As soon as I sat down, I ordered a Georgia Peach (a variation of the Moscow Mule) while I waited for my food. I am pretty picky about my Mules, and this one was delicious. 
For dinner I split a margarita pizza with my friend and had a garden salad as a side. The pizza didn't have tomatoes on it; just tomato sauce- so it seemed more like a cheese pizza, not actually a margarita. The pizza was still pretty good, but the name was kinda misleading. The salad was greens, tomatoes, and croutons w balsamic vinaigrette - so it was pretty basic- but still pretty good. Our waitress was nice enough, but seemed a little frazzled with our group of about 8. Overall, the food was good but didn't knock my socks off. I'm giving Craft 64 a solid four stars because it was a cool place to hang out, the people there were friendly, and my food didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"After a long hard thinking process, I decided to make my 100th review about pizza.  Pizza pie till I die!  That's my motto and I'm sticking to it.

I had never heard of Craft64 until I saw it on the restaurant week list.  That gave us an excuse to try a new pizza place!  Parking around the area can be a bit challenging because of the other great restaurants that surround it, but if you're patient you should find a spot in under 10 minutes.

We arrived at 6pm and selected to eat in their patio outside.  I noticed they had the misters on and the sun was setting already and it was already a cool 72 degrees.  We politely asked our waitress if they could be turned off and she said \"certainly!\"

We ordered off the restaurant week menu.  Listed for $33 per person it gave you a 3 course meal with a drink!  Not a bad deal if you ask me.

Insalata: House Made Mozzarella Caprese 
Absolutely delicious in every way.  Fresh and tasty!

Pizza: The Margarita & the FICO 
You can't ever go wrong with the traditional margarita, but the FICO was on another level.  It had fresh mozzarella - buratta - parmigiana - truffle oil - arugula & fig sauce.  I wanted to eat two of them by myself, alone in my happy place.  My taste buds were very happy with the FICO.  I can't wait to go back to order and eat it once again.  

La Dolce: Nutella Indulgence 
Many traditional Italian pizza places have a similar dessert.  You can't go wrong with this choice.  It's made to perfection.

I had a great experience at Craft64.  Our waitress was very attentive to our needs and we never felt rushed or ignored.  I will be dining here again very soon."}
{"text":"Awesome wine and beer selection.  The fig and arugula pizza was totally different but really delicious.  Only downfall was that its a little close quarters and was insanely busy so it took a while to get seated.  Some of the wait staff was very helpful while others had an arrogance about them.  Overall, great place but a little too cozy."}
{"text":"Love this place and why didn't I discover it sooner!  We can literally walk there from our place and it's nice to have a few drinks and not worry!  Can you say amazing pizza?!  nice and crispy!  The sausage was nice and browned to perfection.  I'm not a salad person but the salad seemed good and everyone liked theirs.  Lot's of great beers too including local ones.  I met one of the owners and it was cool that it is not a chain!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely wonderful.  They have an extensive beer and wine list and the craft beer is delicious.  Service is friendly and knowledgeable and it's clear the owners are involved on a daily basis.  My favorite aspect, though, is the food.  Oh my god, the food.  There are so few places that make me stop, close my eyes and savor every bite, and this place is one.  I've had one of their sandwiches and the Fico pizza, and both items were amazingly good.  I will come here again and again."}
{"text":"so glad this place entered into my life

first off, great atmosphere. feels almost like i am grabbing a bite to eat in my sweet little grandma's house who just happens to brew her own beer and have a pizza oven

when you order food, use your mouth to say these words: \"please give me the Fico Pizza\"

Burrata, truffle oil, fig sauce and arugula. i don't understand it. i don't question it. i just eat it and life loves me for it. seriously the best pizza I've had in the valley. 

not to mention, the service was attentive and welcoming. these guys really do it right. support them and they will support you with love in the form of food

oh yeah and their beer is sensational"}
{"text":"Pizza was on point although a little pricey at 17 for 6 slices. Definetely some of the best gourmet pizza I've had in Scottsdale. Craft beer selection was def the stand out they had huge selection of IPA's and other microbrews. Service was solid. Vibe was ok we sat at bar there is a patio out back and looks like a fairly minimalist approach to decorating. Overall, def a great spot for pizza and beer and worth checking out."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley! The aji pizza is my favorite- a little spicy, but some of the best pizza I've ever had. They also have a ton of beers on tap and the owners are super nice too!"}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday Feb. 6th for my husband's 40th birthday. I had made reservations the Tuesday before and updated the reservation that day of. We were moved out front due to too many other parties on the patio and they said they couldn't call to ask if it was ok because they didn't have my number... so they just moved us anyway. Not sure why they didn't just ask when we called that day. The front patio had high-top tables only.  Majority of the chairs wobbled due to levelers missing or broken on the bottom as was the same with the table.  The hostess kindly brought paper napkins to shove under the table and attempted to fix one of the chairs. At this point the owner Josh whom was our server, came out and saw us all dressed nicely but each bent over trying to fix our chairs to no avail and without his help. 20 minutes later he did finally take our drink order and get us started-charcuterie boards and caprese. Food and drinks were ok -not quite as good as expected for the price and lack of respect for the customer. We stayed only because we were really looking forward to trying the Fico pizza and with 9 people last minute we didn't want to make everyone wait trying to get in somewhere else. Server/owner was civil  enough but \"awkward\" as we all agreed which made us feel a bit the same. He forgot a few drinks here and there and a sandwich we had ordered. He brought it out late after everyone else had been eating dinner and blamed it on the kitchen saying he didn't realize the sandwich would take so long! (Longer than our 5 pizzas from the oven?) The Fico was ok but the fig sauce is more like a jam spread and overcooked on top of the pizza and a bit too much of it. Meatlovers was ok. The spicy pizza (can't remember name) was good.  Caprese homemade mozzarella was good the salad itself needed a drizzle of balsamic. Charcuterie board was lacking -mainly nuts and small, small amounts of cheese and meat. Wine and a large beer list are the only things that made it ok. It really was unfortunate the lack of consideration and hospitality we were shown for not only all of our first visits there but also my husband's 40th birthday. We all will not be back and that is 9 people that live in old town and go out to old town weekly."}
{"text":"Great spot!!  Highly recommend.  Love that they feature AZ micro brews and really know the industry!   Bruschetta was killer and hand made craft pizza is amazing. Bartender  Trish was a great wealth of knowledge and very personable.  Good job Roger!!  We will be back, often."}
{"text":"Love Craft 64.  Perfection is a FICO Pizza and Scottsdale Blond Beer! Roger always stops by our table and offers a friendly chat. Great pizza and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Good beer, good service, football, and really good pizza.  What more could you ask for.  Nothing but good things to say about this place !!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Great service very personable and accommodating, amazing pizza, beer, and the best Moscow Mules I have ever had!"}
{"text":"This place had the best food and service I have seen in a long time. We were celebrating a friend's 50th birthday and they went out of their way to make the afternoon special. I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This place is trying to be a craft beer focused place but in reality it is much more of a wine place.  The food and beer are way overpriced, even for Scottsdale. If you like \"gourmet\" style pizzas you might like it but if you are a traditional type pizza person forget it. The decor is spartan, the place looks like an old house that was converted into a restaurant. The rest rooms are located in a separate building outside.  The bill for two people was over $50 and we still left hungry.   The pizza at Fate Brewing is cheaper and better.

LOL- I couldn't believe the place is 5 stars on Yelp until I looked at most of the 5 star reviews. Funny how so many of the people who gave it 5 stars have only reviewed one place-this place. Beware of fake reviews."}
{"text":"Great experience at this place. Bartender was very knowledgeable pizza was delicious and truly enjoyed the environment."}
{"text":"Happy Hour!! 4-7 7 days  $1 off all beers, $6. Wine
$8.00 happy hour sandwiches, caprese salad, olive bowl and more"}
{"text":"Incredible beer and wine selection. Love love the pizza and salads. Today trying the Italian sandwich. Can't get enough"}
{"text":"Stopped in last weekend on our way to a nearby Wine tasting room. Of all the places we walked by I was relieved by the laid back atmosphere at Craft 64. As we walked in the door my husband and I said ah this feels more like us. Cute outdoor seating. I was impressed with the beer list, However we were drinking wine that night and I was disappointed with the wine. The \"happy hour\" wines were special for happy hour. And tasted like cheap wine. And the regular wine list was disappointing. Not even 1 local wine!!! I am passionate about the AZ wine scene so this was really sad to me. Pizza was really good. Prices are a bit steep but it is in Old Town so I guess that is to be expected. I would stop back for pizza and beer if I was in the area. But not a good wine spot. For me anyway."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time in my whole life favorite  pizza places. The bacon is baked for hours in the pizza oven and believe me when I say you can taste it. 

It's the best bacon I have ever had in my life. I could eat baskets of it. In the summer they have mead, they locally source all their indigents and beers. 

Everything here is amazing from the food to the service. Parking sucks. So expect to take the first spot you find on the street. But it's worth a 5 minute hike from your car."}
{"text":"Great spot for pizza and local beer! We tried the Fico, Spain, Margarita pizzas between 5 people and it was the perfect amount of food. All ingredients were fresh and the service was quick."}
{"text":"First time here and we will be back!! Awesome local beer selection and a majority of their food is sourced locally. Staff was so friendly!"}
{"text":"great little place with a good selection of craft beer, and also some wines for those that aren't into beer.  I tried a pizzetta and it had good flavor and only $7 during happy hour.  Pretty small and intimate, so perhaps not good for a big party, but definitely a nice addition to the area"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for some drinks and food on a Sunday.   Great pizza and caprese salad.  Staff is friendly and very accommodating.  Recommend the bottomless mimosas!  Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Great Pizza!  All fresh and local ingredients...in house, homemade mozzarella is amazing. Awesome beer selection with all local craft brewerys and they fill growlers too!"}
{"text":"I am a wine drinker, but my boyfriend wanted to try some local beers, so this is a great compromise for both of us could enjoy what we like. All of their food is incredibly fresh and local. We split a house salad, which was a good idea because it was huge! Their balsamic vinaigrette dressing was the best I have ever tasted and my boyfriend is a big fan of their homemade croutons. We also split a pizza. I forget the name of it, but it had spicy pepperoni as well as almonds which was a cool combination. Overall, great service, great drinks, and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to sampling an Arizona IPA after reading the reviews. Unfortunately we left after a long wait for service. There wasn't space for two people at the bar, so we sat at the long table parallel to the bar. Maybe we were supposed to go up to the bar to order, but we couldn't get the bartender's attention. This looked like a great place to hang out, but it was an off night in terms of service."}
{"text":"The food and service here is really good. Didn't have any alcohol because I have a long drive ahead. Must stop by if your looking for fresh local produce food."}
{"text":"Horatio is a master pizza maker.  Wonderful, quaint spot with great beer and beautiful, Naples style pizza.  We recommend highly."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh ingredients and reasonable prices!! The quality of all the food and beer was incredible and the staff was very nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  Wonderful selection of beers.  Pizzas are fantastic!  Service is wonderful!  So honey and friendly.  Will go back lots of times!"}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale for Spring Training. We had a great evening at Craft 64. This place was comfortable from the moment you walk in the door. It feels like you are walking into a friends place. 

The beers are all from Arizona Breweries. Being from Northern California I'm always looking for IPAs from different areas. Roger, the owner pointed me towards Craft 64's own Smoove Hoperator.  Great, well balanced ale. If you're from outside of the area and want to try an Arizona Brew go see Roger

The food is really tasty. Great salads and pizzas. We had the Garden Salad and the Blanco pizza. All of it was great.

One of the best surprises of the night If you're looking for a great bottle of wine , then Craft 64 is your place.   

Thanks Roger and the rest of the crew at Craft 64 for a great night"}
{"text":"I love their salad of the week specials, they're always unique and so fresh! The bruschetta is delicious and of course the pizza! I've never gotten anything I didn't like. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The Pizza was not that special. It was okay. Nothing out of the ordinary. We have better pizza in Oregon (Pizzicato).
The noise level is quite high. Service was good and friendly."}
{"text":"Love this little place and cute patio, off the beaten path in Old Town! Tons of wines, great service, great cocktails, delicious food. Perfect for pre-dinner drinks, happy hour, or a casual dinner."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere, great beer selection. Definitely worth it for drinks and a snack!"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar and met a few of the owners.  I really enjoyed talking to them and getting a flavor of all of the different beers.  I had the happy hour pizza and it was one of the best I have had in a long time.  My only complaint was the low ceilings which meant it was really hard to have a conversation because it was so loud.  I am going to come back to try one of their specialty pizza's."}
{"text":"Craft 64
Margarita - Fresh Mozzarella - Tomato Sauce - Basil (Half with Prosciutto)
Nutella Indulgence - Plantains - Hazelnuts - Butter - Fleur de Sel - Desert Honey

Located in Old Town and widely celebrated since opening for a beer and wine list supporting the diversity of breweries and wineries throughout the state of Arizona it was admittedly with other interests in mind that this diner approached Craft 64, an 8pm arrival finding not a single table open with one lone seat remaining at the bar.

Owned by Josh Ivey and Roger Carpenter, both well known locally for work in the world of adult beverages, and tapping Chef Horacio Hernandez - he of 17 years pizza making experience with Chris Bianco - to head up the kitchen, Craft 64 looks much like any other bustling Scottsdale Bar but what those merely walking by may fail to realize is that through a small window to the right of numerous taps the is something truly special taking place, the man known as \"Lachos\" turning out some of the city's best wood-fired dough.

Bustling to the point of bursting, several folks merely passing through as part of a bar hop and therefor never sitting down, it was n front of a jovial bar man that I spent the evening and deferring EtOH in favor of H2O it was after perusing an expectedly well-culled menu that an order progressed, one pie and one calzone delivered in two well timed courses presenting a conundrum as to which was best.

Making dough, cheese, sauce, and every meat except imported prosciutto from scratch, it was perhaps ten minutes before the still-bubbling Margarita arrived before be and opting to add the Italian pork to half in order to experience both base and upgrade the flavor of the crust came across with a robust yeastiness enhanced by char, the tomato sauce a dead-ringer for the purity and balance at Bianco while the cheese was not quite on par to imported Mozzarella di Bufala, but creamy with a good amount of stretch.

Onward to something sweet, the same crust here folded over and baked golden with a molten center of Nutella, Butter and Banana, suffice it to say that the \"Nutella Indulgence\" undoubtedly lived up to its name even before a liberal drizzle of honey, both myself and the barman agreeing that only ice cream could have made it better - an option unavailable since everything at Craft 64 is so fresh that they don't need a refrigerator or freezer."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night with out of town guests before hitting a nearby comedy club for some laughs. Parking was almost non existent and we drove around for a few minutes before finding a spot about a block and a half away. There are literally two parking spaces in front of the restaurant itself.  When we got inside, we were seated right away. Our server came right over and told us right off the bat that he was new and it was his 2nd day on the job. No worries, everyone's new at some point. We ordered drinks, they are known for their craft beer selection. There was no GF beers so I ordered a Tito's vodka (GF) with tea. We then ordered our food. About 15 minutes later our food came but we hadn't even received our drinks yet! We were all a bit disappointed but the mistake was acknowledged and they did take a couple things off the bill for us to make up for it. I had the Bacon Spinach Salad and it was loaded with thick crispy bacon and the dressing was very tasty. The other three in our party got pizzas which they really enjoyed. They all enjoyed their beer selections. Despite the drink error, which did factor into giving them 3 stars instead of 4, we all enjoyed the food and I would definitely give them a 2nd chance because the food was very good and the drink error was acknowledged and apologized for, and they did make it up to us on the bill."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Scottsdale. Dog friendly. What more do you need...? Gives Pizzeria Bianco a run for its money...just no wait, great beer, and you can bring your dog...if I hadn't already mentioned that..."}
{"text":"Pizza was decent . Good beer selection. Nice size patio. Nothing super wow , but it's solid."}
{"text":"We popped in after Spring Training Game and sat on their back patio. Pizza was really tasty. Downside was the ash coming from their chimney on the wood fire stove - we got ash all over our clothes and in our drinks. The outdoor area was really nice - perhaps wind was blowing wrong way that afternoon."}
{"text":"Great beer. Great, simple and wood-fired pizza. Owner is a little on edge and seems anxious the get you the door. Servers are great and personable."}
{"text":"Great selection of Arizona craft beers from Lake Havasu to Flagstaff and beyond.  Nice atmosphere for relaxation with high quality pub fare to compliment the beers.  Wood fired pizzas are particularly delicious, crust charred to just the right flakiness.  Uber it over here, so you can enjoy as many of the beer selections as possible, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Excellent pizza, huge beer selection, great service, and nice atmosphere. Rear patio is really pleasant. Dog friendly. Small place, but didn't feel claustrophobic like some other small places do. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"No jokes here, only food... that I'm still craving today!

Many Mule options to choose.  We went with the Georgia Peach and never looked back, until I ordered the Marmalade Mule, which donkey punched my heart.  Preach the Peach!

The Apple Brie Bruschetta is an incredibly tasty option, sure to make even the prettiest vegetarians giddy with glee.

And the Bistro Bacon Salad will make your omnivore roar with excitement.  That's freshly fried, thick cut bacon in there!

Follow it all up with a Blanco and Sausage pizza... proving we can all be color blind when it comes to taste.

Like Sinatra once sang to Stevie Wonder... \"You are black and I am white, like an eskimo pie, let's take a bite!\""}
{"text":"We just went here for the first time last night and we just loved this place! It really has a great vibe. There was only one table by the door, so we chose to sit at the bar. They are well staffed and the staff all seem to be having so much fun while doing their job! (So refreshing to see!) The bartenders were attentive, personable and funny (bonus!). We ordered the sausage pizza. The price was kind of high for what seemed to be a 12\" pizza, but I have to say it was delicious! They had an incredible selection of all Arizona beers. They had about 6 of their own. My new favorite place!!"}
{"text":"Small cute place.  They have a patio in the back.  Pretty busy during happy hour.  It slows down quite a bit after happy hour.  Looked like there were only 3 guys working there.  The bartender, server, and cook.  Great prices and selections for happy hour.  The happy hour portions are decent.  The charcuterie board was good sans the blue cheese and dirty grapes.  It didn't seem as though the grapes were washed very well....or even at all.  No bueno.  The dirty grapes gave this place 3 stars.  Oh yeah, they sell selected wines to go at discounted prices....but you can't uncork it at the bar."}
{"text":"Group of 8 attended Restaurant week on a Sunday night. The table for us was scrunched up right in front of the restaurant near the front desk. It was tough for our group and the server to maneuver to take orders and deliver food.

One of the first things I noticed were the differences in portions. It was pretty extreme. For instance, with the appetizers/starters, the caprese salad my friends ordered were tiny compared to the eggplant one I ordered. The eggplant was a meal in itself. I had to ask for a box. The eggplant was little too thick for me and the bread served with was toasted at all. I've never had anything like that before and it wasn't in a good way.

My guy ordered the Carne pizza and I ordered the Fico. I liked thh Fico, with arugala, burrata and figs. The Carne was spicy but in a good way. He ate pretty much the whole pizza so assuming he liked it. The wine list and beer list was extensive and the chardonnay listed on the HH menu was good. 

For dessert, I ordered the tiramisiu and he ordered the Nutella. the rest of the group/couples all tried it and again, the portions were surprising. the Nutella dessert was very large and never ending. It was kind of wasteful. He liked it and I didn't even try it because I enjoyed my tiramisiu.

I didn't hear a ton of exclamations or rave reviews while we were eating. I think we would have enjoyed the meal a little better if it wasn't too hot in the room. I asked to turn down the AC but felt no difference. 

It wasn't the worst experience but definitely not a place that will be first in my mind in Scottsdale to recommend. There is tough competition in the pizza business in Scottsdale, Tempe and Phoenix. Hoping Craft 64 fine tunes their recipes and portions since they are a new business."}
{"text":"Amazing wood fired pizzas and a great selection of craft brews. The owner is really involved in the restaurant and behind the bar and I really admire that."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and simple. This has become one of my favorite places in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area. They always have a great beer list and happy hour is everyday. Highly recommend if you're in the area. I believe one of the owners is usually in working the bar and he has a lot of knowledge when it comes to the beer scene."}
{"text":"Been here once, never going again! Took waiter 20min to even acknowledge our presence. Then another 20 to pour a beer. You can't mix and match the bruschetta. If you want a taster flight of beer you can only get it after 8:30pm and even then you can only pick a select few beers.
I'm not even gonna try to explain how mediocre the food was! 
Overall horrible! Especially for Scottsdale... I was appalled!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service !! And 36 AZ craft beers..count me in !! The gentleman bar tending that day recommended the BLT since I wasn't hungry enough for a pizza to myself. Great choice !! The ingredients were all super fresh and complimented my cocktail choice well! I can't recall the name of the cocktail I had but it was made with gin, champagne and lemon juice. Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Another amazing dinner in Scottsdale! Brian was amazing, remembered our order even though we had a couple \"can I make a change on the special\" people. Pizza was very good! Great wine list. Fun atmosphere. Will return."}
{"text":"This was our first time dining at Craft 64.  Overall the experience was worth 5 Stars from start to finish!  This small friendly restaurant is very inviting.    Our server, Brian was so engaging, happy and enjoyable that he deserves the highest accolades available.  Our farmers market salads were fresh and tasteful.  The local Craft 64 beers are delicious.  We enjoyed two wood-fired pizzas - Margarita and Sausage.  The crust is thin and very crispy.  The edges are burnt perfectly.  The flavors blend together producing a wonderful well-crafted pizza.  We favored the Sausage pizza which arrived to our table hot, with a bit thicker crust and delicious.  We will definitely be returning guests to Craft 64!"}
{"text":"So this place does Pizza, salads & craft beers from AZ. Simple. Here's what I like. Happy Hour until 7pm. Yeah. Mozzarella & bread made on premise. Nice touch. Rotating list of more than 30 craft beers from Arizona, very  nice. And our server was extremely knowledgeable which for anyone who has dined in Scottsdale, is a very nice change. Now, why I didn't give Craft 64 more stars. Hype is fine but what the kitchen puts in the window & the server brings to the table is what gets reviewed. The pie's were burnt. I expected more from a Chef who was the #2 guy at Pizzaria Bianco for many years (10+). The stuff on the pie's was fresh so that helped save them. But at almost twice the price of the pie's at Fired Pie, are they worth it? I'll revisit this place & see if they get their oven dialed in. The tables on the patio are to small. As you can see in the pic, three pies & drinks fill the table. Glad our 4th guest was a No-show. But even with just 3 of us, the table was crowded and our pizza trays hung over the edge of the table."}
{"text":"Casual and fun experience.I had the bistro bacon salad with a refreshing root beer.  Our server was attentive and very pleasant.  Love the decor, makes me feel like I am at a friends home enjoying company and great food!"}
{"text":"Wow!! I stumbled on this gem after I sold my public house and have been coming ever since. Friendly and knowledgeable staff in the art of craft beer, where they feature a ton of local beers. When you're done drinking beer the food is amazing!! Wood fire pizzas with local ingredients. I highly recommend the pepperoni with jalapenos but you can't go wrong with any of there food."}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting Scottsdale for a few days and this place came across my search for food so we decided to check it out. Fantastic local beer selection. I had the #7 it was a sour and we also had the #1 the blonde ale. Both were great. We had cheese garlic bread for an appetizer and an amazing pizza they had on special. Excellent service and food. Definitely recommend checking it out !"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza spot!!! While in Scottsdale, pizza was on our list of food to try. We searched for best pizza and of course, Pizzeria Bianco came up but we were hoping for something closer to our hotel. Our plan was to walk there for lunch and be back soon after to lay by the pool. Craft 64 was within walking distance of where we stayed so we gave it a try, and we were so glad we did! We ordered a caprese salad to start, and it was delicious. They make their own mozzarella at the restaurant and their ingredients are fresh and local--the tomatoes were ripe and juicy! For lunch, I ordered the margarita pizza and it was my idea of the perfect pizza. Thin crust, the perfect amount of sauce and chunks of fresh mozzerella spread throughout. Also, fresh basil was added to the top and was a nice touch to every bite--and I'm not a huge basil fan! My husband ordered the carne pizza and ate every single bit of it! He was impressed as well."}
{"text":"Always a huge fan of local brewery, and Craft 64 is surely on the \"must check out\" list. I went there during its happy hour time on one weekday (probably 4:30ish pm), and surprised to find the place was packed! Well, a good sigh of fine food and drinks. Ordered sampler flight so I can try all Craft 64-brewed beer. Craft 64-brewed beer is different - to me, is a little bit light, but the layers of flavor is clear.

Food wise, the farmer's market salad is unique, but I like the cheese and nut board more. Speaking of my most favorite food, it definitely is the Aji pizza - spicy green chili source (I can taste it), fresh veggie, oh, and sausage, great!"}
{"text":"Super tasty food! Great drink options! Super friendly staff! Could go there every night! Sat outside in the back patio!"}
{"text":"This is my hubby's fave pizza spot.  We indulged in the Fico Pizza-with a Fig sauce paied with arugula and truffle oil-sweet and savory all in the same bite.  We paired it with the cruncheriffic Kale salad.  It was Kale good!  We will return-and look forward to happy hour here soon."}
{"text":"Wow! I love this place.  Great food and beer!!Absolutely  Loved the Fico pizza...try it!  We were visiting from out of town and felt very welcome! We waited at the bar for our table and ended up staying at the bar for dinner. Thanks to the staff, Joe and Chris they were the best!   Will definitely come back when in town. And we will tell all our friends!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Love the patio (front or back)
Amazing selection of beers, and the helpful wait staff can suggest and mix combos together for you. Hands down my favorite pizza in Scottsdale. Can't go wrong with the basic pepperoni. The crust is out of this world. 
Great happy hour prices! 
Already purchased a few gift cards to spread the word about this place."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place for their yummy food... ALL homemade, large selection of beers on tap and excellent and knowlagable service. Great neighborhood secret!"}
{"text":"This is a very mixed review. It is based more on the ambience and not the food. It is also based on being at Craft 64 on a Saturday night as opposed to a Friday or Tuesday where I had very pleasant time. Food is top notch and tasty but stay away from the place on Saturday nights.

We called at 6:00 pm and tried to make a reservation for 7:00 pm. I know, short notice but we gave it a shot. No problem they did not take reservations. We arrived at 6:30 and put our name on the list. Ironically most of the tables were empty--maybe they had reservations. At 7:00 pm they got us as we were just about to leave and sat us a table that was empty when we got there 30 minutes earlier.  Happy hour ends at 7:00 pm so we figured they were just waiting till it ended so we would not order off that menu.

Even though more than half the tables were empty the noise level was more defining than a 747. At one point I yell across the table as loud as I could to the two people sitting across from me  and no one blinked an eye. I have a loud voice too.

We were seated in the front area and got to watch people come in and be told there was wait. Still empty tables. Even out side on the patio. I am not sure if the owners were around but if it were my place I would be really concerned as people were being turned away. Four days earlier we were there, met the owners and it was a much different experience. I am glad I did not give it a review then because it would have been 4+ stars. Based on tonight I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best pizza's I've had. Made from all fresh and local ingredients and so tasty.  Ordered the pepperoni and the fico.  Not one slice was left.  The staff and ambience was very nice.  Definitely a place I would revisit."}
{"text":"Stopped at this joint tonight. Great pizza, wine and draft selections. Nikki waited on me, excellent service. If you are in Scottsdale stop by this place you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried this place during restaurant week (May 2015) which was only a couple months after they opened. It was one of the best restaurant week deals as it included a drink, appetizer, pizza, and dessert (for each person). The house wine was a good pairing, and they have a long beer list. The caprese salad was nice, but the eggplant Parmesan will impress you. I'm attempting to duplicate this dish at home because it was so good. We tried the Fico and the Spain pizzas and fell in love with both. Dessert was no afterthought here. The tiramisu was exactly what I wanted it to be (creamy and rum-drenched), but, if you can only choose one dessert, GET THE NUTELLA. You'll be waiting a few minutes for this too cook, but every moment will be worth it when you taste this nutty, creamy, honey-drenched delight. Aptly named as it is a total indulgence."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for happy hour on a Saturday. We sat at the bar and had great service. Many beer options, some delicious pizza, and fun, relaxed, casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great place for a casual dinner. Their home-brewed IPA is awesome and the pizza's are super high quality. I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"So we walked in on a rainy Saturday night and only had to wait for about 10 minutes at the bar, which was great. I will say the host was a tad rude as we had to leave by 7:45 pm due to a reservation. We told them we'd be out before then. That perked up the host but he stalked our table. In the meantime we all enjoyed the caprese salad and split 2 pizzas that were delightful. We really enjoyed the food and the vibe. Good location; next time we are in town I will try to get a reservation."}
{"text":"Visiting from Portland, OR. The beer selection was great. A nice balance of different styles. Kale, pumpkin seed,  and *pear salad was wonderful (the pear was as hard as a baseball- but the salad was exceptional without it). Waiter Keith was very attentive and knowledgeable!"}
{"text":"First timer and I'm impressed ! It looks small but there's a lot seating. We opted to sit outside in the back and the overall ambience and decor was lovely. They have a nice selection of beer and the waitress was very informative. We were a group of 4 and decided two pizzas would be a good start. We ordered the AJI and Carne. I took a slice of the AJI and didn't even bother with the Carne because it was THAT GOOD!!! Everyone else took turns from each pie but when it came down to ordering a third pizza, we all went with AJI!! It's a unique pie with jalapeño sauce and you can taste the fresh ingredients. My advice, TRY THE AJI . Will be back for more AJI and the good service."}
{"text":"Great selection of Arizona craft beers. Plus other great beers in bottles and cans. Definitely need to check this place out if you are looking for local craft beers or other craft beers in the area. Great friendly attentive informative staff that is here to help you with all your beer Wine and Food selections. Definitely worth checking out"}
{"text":"Simply wonderful! The food, the service, the atmosphere...really make you feel home. My boyfriend and I ordered the pear salad and the fico pizza. They were both delicious! I mostly appreciated the texture of the pizza dough, thin and tasty. The fico sauce was a dream!! Our waiter, Andres was charming and attentive ;-) I'm glad to see that it's already getting busy! The tiramisu was also very good and juicy! :P Therefore, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night, and although the place was packed (raining...so no room on the patio), we were able to be seated very quickly.

The wait staff was attentive and very friendly.  The atmosphere is trendy, but not cliche.  It is a very cool setup...with a exquisite selection of wine and local beer.

My wife and I split a garden salad and the Aji Pizza...and I am not exaggerating when I say it was one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten.  The food was terrific.

This place is awesome.  Great service, great food and phenomenal drinks...plus for a Scottsdale venue, was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We had my sons wedding rehearsal lunch here today and couldn't have had a better experience. The service was great; kept eyes on the food and made sure all our guests were taken care of. So many said how delicious the food and different drinks were. Thanks Craft 64 for making a special day even better!"}
{"text":"This place has a great fun vibe from the minute you walk in till you leave. The place isn't big but exudes a vibrancy that makes you hungry and makes you want to try the wide selection of wonderful craft beers that they serve. We ordered a caprese salad large enough for both of us to have 3 slices of tomato with fresh mozzarella. We also ordered bruschetta with marcapone, fig jam and prosciutto, excellent.  The pizza is very good nice crust and lots of great toppings to choose from. We ordered a margarita pizza topped with prosciutto. Good crust, great sauce with large pieces of prosciutto. The pizza is perfect for 2 people of course after eating all that other stuff we were full. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love Craft 64!  All local beer and all local ingredients.  The Spain pizza is something new and different and well worth trying.  We've also had the breakfast pizza, which was one of the best breakfast I've had in a long time!  Plus you get to chat with James and have him pair up the best of what AZ offers by way of beer!  You gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"Here's what left more to be desired. I came for happy hour 3-7pm on a Friday night and ordered the six dollar personal pizza with one topping. They have a wood/brick oven so I was expecting to be amazed by the pizza, but it was a little soggy in the middle. Not sure why...

What I like is the friendly service/bar staff, and the amazing amount of selection of local craft brew. They also claim to make their own mozzarella caprese, which was very tasty in the olive oil sauce. I'll come back and try the pizza again just to see if it was an exception."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  

We stopped in on a walk to another spot and stayed for hours.  We came back the next day with other friends and the following day with families for Mother's Day brunch and have been back twice since.  

The owner- operated business model is a huge bonus in my opinion.  The locally sourced food and beers are fantastic. 

I can not sing enough praises or tell enough people about it.  

Thank you Suzanna and James and Roger and everyone else for our new favorite place."}
{"text":"Amazingggggggggggggggggg Pizza. I got the Carnivore and it was delicious! One of the best pizzas I have ever had. The vibe was super chill. Great atmosphere. Blake our server was bad ass. Great place to go!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a LOT of happy hour fun at our first visit to Craft 64. For that reason, we definitely try to go back whenever in the downtown Scottsdale area. The parking is not so great, but it's worth getting there! The craft selection is truly diverse and LOTS of local (at least 25, maybe more)! This saved us about six trips to different local breweries. Don't get me wrong, I love the valley brewery scene, but it was nice to have a good sampling of some of our favorites in one place, with GREAT prices. They rotate their taps frequently to give everyone a chance. Don't get used to having one of your favorites, it will change. They are very good at seasonal selections. On our first visit, we also enjoyed a super delicious wood-fired pizza. They use fresh, and some local ingredients. We had the fennel sausage and onion. It was cooked perfectly and the sausage was super flavorful. You could really taste both the pork and the spices, the fennel is such a treat in my book. The bartender was a former customer! He was so much fun. He knew a lot about both beer and wine. We got there early and watched the place fill up even though it was over 100 degrees on our first visit. This fall and winter, we will definitely enjoy the outdoor patio. It's a quaint location with good food, awesome beer selection, and good service. I think they have plans to expand their menu, which should be fun to experience if they keep up the same quality level they have now! Can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"100% concur with the high ratings of this establishment.  One of the best pizzas in town.  We have been there several times so consistency of product is good.  
Very inviting atmosphere and great beer selection even for picky palettes.
My only criticism would be the parking situation.  If you live close I would recommend ride share as I have spent many occasions circling the neighborhood look g for a spot.  But this is so a testament to how good the food and experience is.  I typically do not have the patience to spend a significant amount of time looking for parking."}
{"text":"This is a great place to post up at the bar for pizza and a GREAT selection of beer. It's very quaint with a fun atmosphere. I love that it's tucked away in old town away from all the hot spots.  Don't get me wrong it was plenty busy, but I love that it feels hidden. 

They have a great patio, but when we visited it was way too hot to enjoy it. (I will be venturing back when it's not as hot as the surface of the sun.) 

We ordered a pepperoni pizza and it was delicious! I was so glad they suggested it. Not only because it was delicious, but we needed some carbs at this point in the days adventures.  

They have a fantastic selection of local beers on tap. From what I understood, they're all local. Like most places we were able to sample and check it out beforehand...each were delicious. Our group went from IPA to porter and none of them disappointed. 

Staff was stellar, very friendly and knowledgable (always a plus). Overall, a great experience and we will be back! :) check it out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This reminds me of a really cool place that I would have wanted to go to while in college, but didn't have the money or the id to go! But now I do and it was a really cool vibe, relaxed atmosphere and a casual environment. The food was fantastic! The pizza had a lot of flavor and we just ordered the margarita pizza. We ordered two salads; the special salad of the night was unique with the out of the ordinary vegetables and the tomato/mozzarella with olive oil was very well done with a higher quality of cheese. The beer selection is amazing especially if you are a fan of local breweries. Support local is my motto so this was the perfect spot. We went around happy hour by coincidence so pricing on our entire bill was very fair. I would highly recommend checking out this little gem in Old Town Scottsdale you'll love the food and the laid back vibe. If there was one knock on the restaurant it was the volume level was a little high, if it was turned down a notch it would have been a little easier to have a conversation with my dinner guest. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pizza was okay but slightly burnt crust. Not a huge menu selection. I see the appeal because it's definitely a cute, cozy spot and would be a great place for drinks and tapas. But if you're super hungry, you may want to try elsewhere."}
{"text":"After a long day of travel and tourist-ing around Old Town, we decided to grab pizzas to bring back to our hotel for dinner as we were on East Coast time. We got a white pizza and a red sauce one. The white one was definitely the winner, the other forgettable. The bar service was great. Loved the sarcastic humor of the bartender. We tasted beers from their line along with other locals while waiting on takeout pizzas. We each ordered a different IPA, but nothing we tasted was very unique or memorable. Overall a decent experience, but with all of the other options in town, would likely not return."}
{"text":"I walked into this place a bit late but they still took care of me. I don't encourage people doing that but I found that to be very comforting. They made me a pie and I have to tell you it was phenomenal. Awesome place that supports local brewery's and serves great pizza. Small town feel, big time taste."}
