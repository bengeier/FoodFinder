{"text":"This is about as perfect as sushi can get for me.  Very close to where i live. Very web friendly with nice pics of almost every item with a description.  Pretty good prices for pretty large portions with extra rolls when you spend $10, $20, etc.  Best part is the great selection, friendly workers there and amazing sushi rolls.  Never an issue in more than a dozen trips there.   The food is truly mind blowing, just close your eyes and pick at random and you will be pleased.  I hope I don't jinx this place, but they used to be empty whenever I would pass by, but i guess word gets around, as they are now much busier and now have a second location.   Their new menu is very classy and they even gave a canvas bag the last time I picked up with their logo.  The place is tiny though, maybe 15 seats, and yet not really the intimate type because of the large corner windows. More of a friends/co-workers kind of place."}
{"text":"Pretty decent spot for sushi. I had a big 40 piece and the variety of rolls and nigiris were pretty good. First time I encountered tempura sweet potato rolls (I love potatoes) and it was great. Forgot to ask for some spicy mayo... I generally like to try a sushi place's spicy mayo to see how creative they get with it. Overall good spot, not too bad prices."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff!! Really good quality sushi! I work nearby and i always order from there! More of a take out place but still a very cute spot, must try and you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"Sushi is near and dear to my heart. Born in Osaka, Japan and growing up in the parents' sushi restaurant in Osaka and being around my father who was bonafide sushi chef trained in Japan gave me a unique appreciation for sushi.  Toronto being so far inland makes it hard to get descent sushi at reasonable prices. Add to that sushi places that do not vinegar the rice properly or use the proper procedure during preparation can change the taste. Given the above, I'm happy to say this Tora Sushi has high quality fish, although limited selection but proper sushi. I think they deliberately limit their selection so that quality will be high for the fish they do get on hand. I think that this is a Japanese way of thinking by the Japanese owner. My mother and her Japanese friends also approve the sushi here.  On the other hand, my Japanese friends do not approve of the Fish store in the same building, not sure what it's called, By the Sea or something.  So, anyways, Tora Sushi is perfect for preordering party sushi take out place. It's not a sit down eatery. They have snack/lunch size packs you can buy and sample for a quick bite.  So recently my friends from San Jose was holding a wedding in Toronto. I was in charge of procuring sushi for the wedding reception held on May 6th. I ordered 2 Matsu platters and 1 rolled sushi platter. I also had to order a small platter from another place called Taro's Fish on Sheppard since Tora Sushi does not have all the fish variety the bride wanted but it cost lot more.  I picked up a sushi soy sauce from the Hesei Market on the other side of the building and it was good to go. Advice: Use only sashimi/sushi soy. Don't use those packets of salty regular soy they give you. Always use the milder, sweeter sashimi & sushi soy that has Mirin, strained bonito & konbu dashi as three of the ingredients to get that authentic sushi taste from Japan. The bottle I picked up didn't have any English on it except for the taped on ingredients list. It's a small brown bottle by Kikkoman, all in Japanese.  The sushi appetizers were a hit at my friend's Greek/Japanese wedding. Japanese guests and sushi snobs alike raved about the sushi. Authentic sushi & authentic sushi soy makes the best combo!! :). Oh, one more thing. Make sure wasabi is inside the sushi for proper sushi integrity. No putting wasabi in soy! BAD!  So, if you're not expecting a sit down restaurant, this take out place has limited selection of fish but you want good quality fish at reasonable prices, and you're going to host a gathering with sushi, this is the place for you.  This is NOT the place to bring your date as this place has zero atmosphere and just take out. Lol.  Of course there are other places with Japanese chef also concerned about quality but it's gonna cost you a lot more in Toronto. I'll review other authentic places in my view separately.  In short, great authentic party tray sushi by  a Japanese chef that does not break the bank."}
{"text":"Really nice folks working here when I came by the other day for lunch. Only a couple of tables, empty, I'd guess they do more takeout. I rarely crave sushi, commercial fishing bums my tastebuds out, but sometimes it does happen and then I try to find something delicious nearby. The menu had a lot of cream cheese and smoked salmon on it so that caused some concern, and the eel rolls I ordered came with big chunks of fake crab it them which hadn't been in the description of the roll. They were happy enough to make the rolls again without the goberge when I spoke up about how I'd deliberately tried to not order crab or fake crab, and then they were ok. All the rolls were ok, but just ok. My thing with sushi was not improved by this experience."}
{"text":"I decided to try out Tora cause I thought the Japanese authenticity would make this sushi restaurant above most others in the GTA, especially since it's located inside J-Town.  The best way to describe this restaurant is that it's a \"no-frills\" sushi restaurant. What you see is what you get; nothing more. There is no menu, and what you see being offered is the extent of what's available. The prices I find are very reasonable for the quality you receive.  Overall this restaurant is good for your cheap, fill-it-up sushi. Of course it depends on what sushi is being offered that day, but I find the fish overall quite fresh and definitely worth trying.  If you're opting for take out, you don't have to enter this place. The J-Town complex has a small section for sushi from Tora, and I see the employees replenishing the stall often so it's guaranteed fresh."}
{"text":"3 stars The pre-made and limited selection of the staples (kapamaki, egg, futomaki, salmon and shrimp) are actually well done. The rice is very good and their inarisushi is quite delicious. That is it though. They do not make anything else or accept orders. It is a take-out counter with three token chairs in case anyone wants to sit there and eat out of those plastic sushi trays. Why they do not do much more is a mystery Why JTown does not have a high-end sushi restaurant is a mystery Tora does not do sashimi because that is served next door and next door (By The Sea) does not do sushi because Tora does sushi. Party trays are available from a binder for pre-order.  Hello, Jtown: get a good sushi restaurant. Hello, Jtown: get a decent ramen restaurant."}
{"text":"Voici un très bon comptoir à sushi situé dans la petite Italie. Il y a bien des tables pour les clients qui désirent manger sur place, mais l'endroit est relativement petit. Il est donc préférable de réserver afin d'éviter les surprises car il s'agit surtout d'un comptoir pour apporter.   La force de cet endroit réside dans le site web qui est facile d'utilisation avec une photo pour chaque mets proposé. Utile tant pour la livraison chez vous que pour les commandes à apporter.   Les sushis sont succulent. Certains sont des conceptions originales que vous ne trouverez qu'ici. Pour ceux qui cherchent quelques chose de différent, je recommande le suhi \"Buffalo Wing\" avec poulet tampura épicé. Un petit délice."}
{"text":"Le service est beaucoup trop long. Plus d'une heure et demi pour une commande pour emporter"}
{"text":"Tora Sushi is my favourite place for 2 kinds of sushi - Futomaki (big roll with egg, cucumber, kanpyo, fake crab) and Inari sushi (fried tofu pockets, cooked in sweet soy sauce).  There is no other place in Toronto that does these as well as Tora (even my mom, but don't tell her please!)  For a few generations, decades before the concept of AYCE, when there were almost no Japanese restaurants or grocery stores in Toronto, where sushi grade fish was non-existent, these were the only kinds of sushi Japanese Canadian families made at home.  It is Japanese Canadian comfort food.  Tora Sushi is not a place for AYCE fans, this is not even a place for those who want different kinds of sushi.  Its very basic here, but very authentic -  anyone who has had proper sushi, knows the difference between plain rice, and authentic vinegar sushi rice, and Tora does it right.  Some reviewers have wondered why they don't have more sushi available, and why they often won't make it \"on demand\", and that is because they get enough business from the Japanese community, ordering platters or just going in for whatever they have available.  We know how much work it is to make this at home, and having a place to buy authentic sushi is so convenient while at J-Town, shopping for other groceries."}
{"text":"Traditional Japanese sushi done well located within J town. Small yet efficient space."}
{"text":"Tout simplement bon. Des sushis aussi délectables les uns des autres. Le service est rapide et courtois. Les saveurs disponibles sont assez varié et leurs option de commande en ligne est vraiment pratique."}
{"text":"I decided to try out tora sushi for takeout today and I felt like I was cheating on my regular to-go sushi place, Nippon.   I ordered the lady in red, salmon tartar maki, sushi salmon and the crispy scallop sushi. The website was beautiful and the interactive layout was so well presented that I thought I would be in for a great experience. Unfortunately, the eel was a bit fishy (ha ha I know, it's fish, but the taste was too strong) and the salmon was bland and water-washy. It tasted like soba sushi to me, and I am not a fan of soba sushi.  The tartar maki however, was the best and I think that's why I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 2.. It had strawberries and the combination of tastes worked really well..   The sauces were...... All the same. I couldn't distinguish between them due to the extensive amount of mayonnaise in both.   I can't describe the taste of the fish because it wasn't necessarily bad, but the quality was not up to par."}
{"text":"Tora Sushi is located at J-Town complex but no one probably notice it existence as it is kind of hidden at the corner of the last small store space in the J-Town complex right across from Izakaya Ju.  Tora Sushi is strictly a small take out sushi joint with limited hours: You can ordera party tray but with at least 24 hours notice. There are so pre made sushi to go on the counter if you want to grab something fast to go.  Salmon Hosomaki ($4.90) was nicely prepared. The nori can be crispy but the shari rice was well flavoured and have a good bite! Great snack portion...  So try your luck to see what they have available."}
