{"text":"I had ordered a soup and this was the first restaurant that I had visited where the pepper had already been added as it came out of the kitchen; rather seemed like they put in a spoonful over the soup, rather than having the customer take care of that. The soup had too much of pepper."}
{"text":"Tasteless food with no understanding of salt and spices ratios. One of the curries was watery with no taste. It seems the new management and cooks don't even know the meaning of Indian cooking."}
{"text":"Good food, despite coming late, but very poor service. Could improve. Management team did not want to honor Groupon ticket."}
{"text":"Being an Indian myself and fond of cooking indian food, this place has failed twice when I tried the food after the new management took over.The papads came with oil dripping and mint and tamarind chutneys served with it has no taste, it appeared they added water just before serving to increase quantity.

Ordered paneer butter masala, it had no flavor and I could see water being added in that too as it was too watery and no salt or masala's in it.Naan was okay.They don't bother to refill your empty glasses with water and service is slow.This was the most tasteless indian food I ever ate in a restaurant in usa.

The owner may pretend to come talk to every table trying to be informal and friendly but food is what is going to keep the customer happy in the first place.Nothing had taste in it...no salt , no proper combination of spices...new mgmt need to work on it else it wouldn't take long for them to vanish in no time like many other charlotte restaurants. Sorry but you have lost few customers today due to these recent bad experiences."}
{"text":"Tulips have the best authentic Birani I've tasted in charlotte! The lamb sheik kebab is my personal favorite.. It's only downfall is the price as it's more expensive than other Indian restaurants in the university area."}
{"text":"The Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani was fantastic. The rice was very well flavored with succulent pieces of tasty chicken. We also tried their Kadai Paneer which was every bit authentic and wonderful taste. 

Looking forward to taste more of their dishes!!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken tikka masala and it was great! The garlic naan was also a wonderful addition to our meal. We were promptly greeted once we entered Tulips and our host checked on us periodically to see if we were ok. I would definitely go back to Tulips for the low key ambience and tasty authentic Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. 
After a long time, I had the food which is actually spicy when menu is marked as spicy.. Menu has got all variety of Indian cuisine and evry item tastes gud... Hope they sustain same taste in longer run"}
{"text":"Very bad Food. Nothing was tasty in the whole buffet except dessert. Those two stars are only for the service provided by the kind lady."}
{"text":"I came across Tulips through word of mouth of a friend who loves their food & he was so right! Me & my husband have tried all varieties of their food - vegetarian, non vegetarian, buffet, eating in & take out. The food is mind blowingly delicious! Since I love Indian food, I eat Tulips food as my comfort food. Great for the taste buds & super awesome to bring childhood memories of Indian home made food."}
{"text":"Not worth the price of the dosa buffet. Way better restaurants for a marginally better price"}
{"text":"We have passed this place a bunch of times and finally had a chance to grab dinner. I purchased a restaurant.com gift certificate that I brought with me. When we walked in the door we were greeted immediately with a smile and an offer for the buffet. The entire buffet was vegetarian which was perfect for me. I asked if that could be used with the gift certificate/voucher. I was immediately told no. The buffet is $10.99. No worries my husband wanted chicken and planned to order off the menu so I too grabbed a menu. We were seated at a booth with dirty placemats. We reviewed the menu and I ordered the veggie thali. The same girl who said no buffet told me no thali because the thali is the same as the buffet. OK fine-- I am 0 for 2. I ordered the Chana masala. It was ok. Kind of boring after seeing the buffet and the thali on the menu. They came and refilled our water carafe but as other reviewers mentioned no ice which is crazy when it is 90 degrees outside. I went to pay and the same girl basically shamed me for using a certificate saying it was slow and that I had to wait. She hand wrote the voucher number and made a call. Then she swiped my card again on her cell phone. Perhaps the connection was down. Who knows. I walked out of there thinking why would a place under new ownership offer groupon and reataurant.com gift certificates and than make them hard to use. We were served large portions and the food was hot. I wouldn't eat here again based on the service alone. Fortunately in the vicinity there are several Indian food options. This establishment is not at all service oriented."}
{"text":"Heard some nice things about this place, so decided to check it out for a saturday lunch buffet. It closes at 3 PM on weekends and I was pretty impressed that were ready to serve folks who came in after 3 PM and did not turn them away.

The spread was pretty vast. I tried onion pakoda and gobi 65 which were pretty good. Veg biryani and Pasta were decent. Non veg spread was amazing, they really are multi cuisine and had Chicken Majestic and Kungpao chicken both delicious. Tandoori chicken was great and not like the typical lunch buffet tandoori chicken (read stale and fresh from the fridge reheated) you get in most indian restaurants. Two rounds of the appetizers and I had no space left for chicken biryani (which is usually my go to item in buffets).

The price of 9.99 is way below what I expected, but I'm not complaining. The service was good for most parts but it could go up a notch. I don't get the negative review and totally think it is definitely on par if not above spice cafe and spice 9. Go check it out today!!

P.S. I'm looking forward to dinner there to try the hyderabadi biryani and haleem."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!   The food is absolutely fantastic!   The service is extremely friendly.  Tulip's will be a definite must every time we come to Charlotte.  
The garlic nan was perfect and I had the best Chicken Marsala  ever.   We've been to many Indian Cuisine restaurants in the US and Japan, this one gets our vote by far!"}
{"text":"This place is Under New Management.
Everyone from the greeter to the waiters were very responsive and friendly.
I was very happy with my meal choice and it was extremely good.. Maybe everything was better than expected after reading the Yelps from the prior owners had lowered my expectations---- was happy to find out they are under new owners-- but maybe they should have changed the name"}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets.  Paneer pakora was delicious and the portion was huge.  Muttar paneer, which is my go to, was simply amazing, even though it could be a bit spicier.

The new owners are very friendly and helpful, and while I never visited under the old management it really seems like they are taking the restaurant in a good direction.  I highly recommend you check this place out.  It's a bit hard to get to with the light rail construction traffic but the 7 u-turns you will have to make will be worth it when you are jamming on some naan.  Promise."}
{"text":"Me and my girl went yesterday, Chicken tikka masala and their garlic naan was on point. When you enter the Resturant, the fresh cooking food smell is a teaser.  Not only the smell, but the taste of the food was as great as the smell. Definitely coming again for the food and student discount."}
{"text":"We went for dinner buffet yesterday after a long time. The baby corn appetizer was so bad that it  looked like old food . To add to it , Mysore bhajji was horrible . They could have atleast changed the name . Jeera rice , vermicelli trays were empty. Naan wasn't available . Veg biryani looked like it was prepared long back . Wasn't satisfied at all . Bad experience .!"}
{"text":"Online delivery takes forever to deliver:( My apartment is 3 miles out but had to wait for 90+ minutes for simple appetizers.

The dishes were not yummy too.!! Expect a better response."}
{"text":"Finally after months and months of hearing that I had to get to Tulips....me and a couple of my teammates were able to try it.  Will be very brief here.... the flavors were good.  Parking was good.  The ambience OK.  I would probably figure out a way to have a greater shield to block the view of the kitchen entrance as you enter the restaurant....especially since the buffet is also just to the right of that entrance.  Rest of restaurant was nice, clean and well arranged.  Another thing that we had to share with our host....was that the buffet should be hot. The naan was not hot...and appeared to be an hour old.  The other items on the buffet were just below luke warm. Food must be served hot on a buffet to be enjoyable.  Will I return.....well...if I can pull myself away from my number one spot for Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"the food here is wonderful, they have a great dinner menu and if you are unsure of what to get, go there for the lunch buffet, they have a lot to choose from."}
{"text":"Food was above average for Indian restaurants standard. 

Goes without saying they are the only one with Rumali Rotis which I didn't remember when we had before this."}
{"text":"Well we were the last ones for the buffet, the time says its till 3 on Sundays but there were no refills after 2 30. 

At least we got naans as we asked for them specially.

About food, ya it was ok... Some things were very good ( chilli chicken, matar Paneer) but others subsidized the excitement (mutton, as it was very hard)...

All in all, you you can give it a try if you are hungry but don't expect too much."}
{"text":"Food was really good and fresh. Vegetarian and Vegan friendly...Everything we had was amazing! Will be back."}
{"text":"They have stale food and it almost always tastes a day old. Chicken is not fresh, esp for their lunch buffet. Never enjoyed my meal here."}
{"text":"I've been here for the buffet four times in the past 2 months, and I will be back. My only real complaint is that the food on the buffet is never hot (temperature). Every time I've been, the buffet has different options. The red fried gobi is great, as well as the saag and other gravies. The Chinese noodles were spicy! The buffet naan is typically stale, but they are happy to bring fresh naan to your table if you ask nicely. 

Home cooked Indian food is by far superior, but I don't have high expectations for buffets, so Tulips works for me."}
{"text":"Update...had a somewhat unfortunate experience here at lunch today.  They only had half the buffet open, which I understand because it's a weekday and we are paying less.  The service was terrible though.  All the staff were unfriendly.  Such a contrast to the last time I came here!  They took their time refilling the empty buffet items (including naan....seems an Indian place should really try not to run out of naan).  Anyway, I was very disappointed, especially compared to the wonderful experience I had here last time."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST INDIAN food ever not just in Charlotte but in the entire US !! They have the best Tandoori chicken I've ever had ! Mind blowing food ! Not to be fooled by the humble ambience ...The food ...Their flavors will blow you away !!"}
{"text":"This place has gone from bad to awful. I even tried their dosa night. The dosas were not properly done.  I had to throw out the stuffings on most of the ones i trued (don't even try egg masala and chettinand dosa). On top of all this, the service is pathetic. Normally, i do not have high expectations in the service department in indian restaurants. But, with so many indian restaurants in the area, i would have thought these guys would strive for better customer service."}
{"text":"Best authentic Hyderabad biryani in Charlotte. Weekend lunch buffet is awesome,  3-4 non veggie appetizers, followed by two chicken gravies and a mutton curry, Naan and biryani. Minimum 4 desserts.."}
{"text":"This location seems to be a bad omen for new restaurants as everything that has been here ended up closing in a very short amount of time but I'm hoping for a better outcome for Tulips as I really enjoyed the different options offered on their buffet and the price was pretty awesome for what I received.  Keeping my fingers crossed for the newest Indian spot in the University area....."}
{"text":"Yes, today is the day, I will never ever visit this place again, never had a chicken briyani taste like dal rice, for tat $15 charged... Good bye tulips."}
{"text":"This was SO delicious! Everything I tried was full of flavor; no two dishes are the same. I know virtually nothing about Indian food, but I do know a good bit about quality food, which is what I had today. The curried dishes were wonderful, and there was a chicken dish that looked like it has a dry rub on it; very red. AMAZING. The breads there complimented the food very well, and there are vegetarian options that are just as good as everything else. Make sure you try the potatoes in red sauce, the chutney and creamy yogurt sauce, and the \"orange shot\" drink, too! There is also a very nice, very fresh selection of salad vegetables and fruit, both beautifully presented. The service was perfect, and I loved how we were brought a lovely carafe of water. I HATE having to ask for more water. Just a perfect lunch. My husband and I went on Sunday, and the buffet was 12.95 each. Super price for healthy, non greasy food."}
{"text":"The restaurant came to me via a recommendation. I ordered the goat Mutton Dum Biryani, which was basically just bones and rice. Tasted good but not the protein I was hoping for. I also wish they would include utensils and napkins in the take-out."}
{"text":"Great and authentic tasting kothu parotta. Highly recommend this. On the spicier side. Friendly service. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I had some excellent Romali Roti love their fish Dishes as well not too spicy not to mild.  Very polite and professional people working at this place and very good with delivery.  Definately has become my new regular place."}
{"text":"I assume we spoke to the manager. I have had Indian before but my partner did not. The food was a bit burnt, which sucks because we were the only ones there at that time of evening. There was one dish I ordered and my partner the Kabob plate. The meat is what was burnt. The dish I order was amazing. Chicken tikka masala I think. 
None of the food was too spicy for us. And I would surely try again but for the buffet, not ordering off the menu. Was a bit disappointed but have no problem retuning but when able to experience a larger variety."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!  Mostly Indian (Multi- region Indian) with some Indo-Chinese and a few Mediterranean dishes... EVERY Dish we ordered was a 5 yelp star experience or very close!!!

Friday Night Dinner (Day after Valentines) our first Dine here of Many to come!

Masala Dosa... If you have never had one of these I hate to spoil the Surprise by telling you when it comes to your table you could wonder, what you ordered... My photos will not give it away too much unless you realize how large the plate is! 

Onion Kulcha... This was the BEST Version of this Bread and one of the BEST Breads I have Eaten ANYWHERE!!!  It was spicier than any though it was not too spicy!

Butter Chicken is the common name for Makhani Chicken (I think)... Mmmmm!!!! GREAT Flavor, ordered Mild, Served Mild! If you say Butter Chicken they will know what you mean!

Vegetarian Biryani... INCREDIBLY Flavorful!!!  The Spice level begins near hot (not Indian Hot)!  It was too much for my Girlfriend (aka Wife) the Spiciness was sneaky I thought and did not notice for several bites and though my lips were burning I did not Break a sweat... If you like Spicy HOT and Biryani you'll probably LOVE this... POPROCK LOVE, hey!  More on the \"spices for this dish  : : they use some chunks of some of the seasonings...so be careful, eat slowly and you'll probably enjoy it more!  5 stars with EASE!!!

Masala Chai... Mmmmm this one is Plenty Nice!

Dessert - I do not remember what it was called, I have eaten it in other Indian Restaurants and this one is better though I do not need to taste it again!!!  I LOVE Kulfi (when it is Very Good) they do not Serve Kulfi Yet!!!  

Note to the Owners... If you care to Make some Kulfi... Pistachio is Fine, Espresso Flavor would be Fantastic!

Service!!!  The Primary Lady that served us was very polite and let me know she understood what I meant and if they did not have something she let me know she did know the Dish and that they did not have it!  For a place that has recently Opened they are doing very well.. A Man opened the Door for us as we arrived and as we left!  Nice Touch!!!"}
{"text":"Food is Ohk. Price is very expensive than any Indian restaurant probably in whole NC. Hospitality is veryyyyy poor, therz one old guy at the counter, he doesn't know how to behave with customers."}
{"text":"Non veg starters were good....... but Unbalanced spices.. fish curry tasteless... Chicken biryani salt less of course spice less.... lemon shots too sweet... overall i had very tasteless lunch..."}
{"text":"Nothing special about their food. The food tastes like what you get from any mediocre indian place. Not authentic as well."}
{"text":"We saw the tulips iftaar buffet on tulips Facebook page and went to the restaurant . 15$ was the buffet cost . Bit high for a restaurant in Charlotte . Checked the non veg appetizer- chilly chicken . It was hard to eat , tasteless . Chicken biryani taste was missing. Naan wasn't available . Finally paid the bill and came home and drank sprite to fill up my belly . I wouldn't go here after . Please improve the food."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants in Charlotte. The food was great the service was good too. This not the first time at this restaurant either the good experience has been consistent eveytime. The stores environment is great too. Anyone who likes going Indian resutants this is definitely the place to go. I have tried others around charlotte. Tulips is definitely the top one no question. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely phenomenal! I had the chicken tikka masala, veggie rolls, and original naan bread. Quick service. I had a living social deal. Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Nothing's good about this place. The staff isn't friendly. Last time we went there they charged us heavy gratuity. Price Not worth the quality of food."}
{"text":"We went late Wed night, during their monthly buffet celebration.  The manager let us use the 10% off coupon, and get a to go plate even when they don't usually do that during the special event. The food was great.  They helped us pick out the vegan options on the buffet,  and gave us a little tour of the place.  They were all very polite and helpful."}
{"text":"I would say give -1 star most pathetic food. service was worst never take the buffet u wait for the food in the queue and they reheat the food nothing was fresh !! Meat smells bad never go"}
{"text":"I was always told if you go into a restaurant and the natives are eating there, then you know you hit the jackpot.  That statement is very true in this situation.  The food here is spectacular and worth every penny.  I love the lunch buffet.  It's certainly worth the $6.99."}
{"text":"I have been here few times now , somehow they don't make me to go again. Yeah the dosa buffet was poor with very limited options served with poor dosas. I was holding this review until another visit. Again today got the fried rice on table in the name of Andhra special chicken Biriyani, oh come on I had to write it today !!"}
{"text":"Great food and a nice location!

Try the biryani next time you go there !"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!! My daughter and I went today and were really surprised at the service, ambience, and taste of the food....Something different and delicious"}
{"text":"Pathetic one, food is costly and quantity is not even worth enough for one person.we brought mutton biryani for 16$!!!! it is such a premium rate and it was not sufficient for even a one person."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken Korma & Tikki Masala along with an order of peshwari / garlic naan for take out. Delish!!!!! The korma was the most flavorful and aromatic I've ever had. The only reason I'm giving 4 out of 5 stars is because the rice to entree ratio was way off. We will definitely be back and look forward to trying other dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious and great customer service. Only thing they only do buffet after 8pm bit buffet has almost everything on menu and all u can eat. Who doesn't love that?"}
{"text":"Oh my God, how can serve such terrible food at a restaurant? You seriously do business feeding this to people?
Where should I start, my husband and I decided to give this restaurant a try because we had a Groupon. I read the reviews, so I was forewarned, but I still thought of giving them a try. When we go here, we found out that they were doing dosa night buffet so we couldn't use our Groupon for that. Fair enough. We decided to go with the dosa buffet. 
We were seated and given water. Water was tap water, not cold, neither served with ice. How can you serve lukewarm tap water when it's 90 degrees outside?!
We ordered three dosas, chicken kheema, chicken 65 and paneer masala. The girl who brought out our dosas cleared screwed up our order because she brought out one plate of \"3 veg dosas\" and one plate of \"1 non-veg dosa.\" Even though we ordered 1 \"veg\" and 2 \"non-veg.\" Regardless. The dosas were undercooked. Besides, the \"non-veg\" dosa was a boiled egg dosa. The other plate had a scrambled paneer dosa (not masala paneer), scrambled chicken, and the chicken 65 was chicken nuggets battered in bright red food coloring and deep fried. So basically these guys tried to pass off bright red chicken nuggets as \"Chicken 65.\"
Everything on the buffet tasted terrible, except for the noodles. It's pretty hard to screw up double ka meetha, and yet, they managed to ruin that too. All the non-dessert dishes were high on spice and low of flavor. I am not sure how these guys have managed to stay in business for so long. Then my coworker told me that this place used to be amazing, until the new management took over. What shame!
The interior decorations were minimal with peeling wallpaper around the dining room. Nothing in here suggested we were at an Indian restaurant. No Indian decor, no paintings, no hanging lights or table decorations. Basically these guys have made no effort to give this place any character whatsoever, or tried to create an ambience. It felt like I was eating in a hostel dining hall. 
The only reason I gave them two stars is that the guys that seated us and explained everything to us was really sweet, friendly and soft spoken, as was the gentleman at the cashier's desk. Needless to say, we canceled the unused Groupon order and got a refund there. Never again, never again!"}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon this afternoon to use this evening. Arrived at the restaurant and it was closed, as in out of business. Called their number and it's disconnected. Their website is still up but the restaurant isn't. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"This is a very promising restaurant that JUST opened a few weeks back. I came along unsuspectingly, unsure of what type of cuisine was being served exactly. Upon entering, I saw hot dishes on a buffet line, alongside freshly prepared naan and salads. The Indian owners that greeted me confirmed it - this was an Indian lunch buffet!

I was overcome with joy and anticipation. Here I am, in the middle of a decidedly healthy period of eating, standing at an Indian lunch buffet. Yes, the owners will claim that is actually indo-chinese, and the manager of the restaurant herself moved from Darjeeling, but the focus is most definitely on Indian dishes. Chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, daal, palak paneer, mixed vegetables... this place has it all, alongside some chicken pakoras with an indo-chinese flair. The naan is freshly prepared, and the chutneys (usually overlooked) were chunky and rich, as opposed to watery and bland. 

The manager was very accommodating, noting that although I came in only 5 minutes before closing time, they were happy for me  - even my friend who hadn't arrived yet - to partake in the lunch buffet. At $9.95, it was reasonably priced, and my three trips down its lines most definitely ensured that I received my money's worth. 

Try Tulips! It has one of the best lunch buffets in the north Charlotte area, and I will certainly be back soon."}
{"text":"It was too much of spice on every food. We tried 4 different dishes, good but too much spice."}
{"text":"This Indian spot is so amazing! They have many special and authentic Indian main dishes and desserts.First the free Pappad was better than Passage. We ordered chicken Biryani and it was good tho one of the sauces served had a bit strange flavour. Carrot Halwa was just so yummy, you can smell the carrot's smell but you can't taste the carrots's flavour. It was kinda like smashed carrot but it maintained carrot grains, really awesome. The only drawback is that the location is not at the front of the plaza and the roads nearby are under construction"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for iftari one night with some family members. The two stars reflect the average review for our group as a whole. I was generally disappointed. While the menu items were plentiful, they were not warm. I got so excited when I saw someone bring out what looked like hot vegetable biryani (I could see steam coming off of it) and I thought to myself YAY! HOT! but when I got back to my table, I stuck my silverware into a potato and took a bite and it was seriously refrigerator cold. I figured it was because they mixed the hot with whatever was already out on the buffet but I was definitely not happy. The chicken tikka masala was not bad and the chili chicken was also decent. They had several dessert options but I did not try any. We ordered a couple teas after the meal and it took nearly 45 minutes to receive because of some \"miscommunication.\" We got a verbal apology about this but nothing more. As iftari this year begins around 8:30, it was really late in the evening on a week day by the time this happened so it was totally uncomfortable for me. I will say that the staff regularly filled water glasses and took away dirty plates but that's about the only plus I can give."}
{"text":"Service (Shabazz?) was great.  Ordered from menu.  Good food- chicken tikka masala great taste but very lean on chicken. Chicken vindaloo nice and spicy.  Great location, unassuming yet comfortable atmosphere.  A bit pricey, however.  Plan to visit again."}
{"text":"My wife and I have had the lunch buffet here several times.  There's always a terrific choice with some excellent dishes.  Great selection of meat and vegetarian food.  The staff are very helpful and courteous.  We love this place."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best Indian food restaurants!  The manager was very knowledgable and helpful when it came time to order.  The food was outstanding, fresh, and authentic.  The restaurant itself is family friendly and clean.  Highly recommended if you like a taste of real India!  It was so good that I'm taking the family back for a second time in one week."}
{"text":"The quality of the food offered is good but it is too expensive. 5 of my friends visited this place for a Lunch Buffet on a Sunday and each of us ordered a drink as well.We were surprised by looking at the bill. Man it was 95$ for 5 of us for a normal Lunch buffet. $19 per person is really too expensive. Even though the buffet costs $12.99, the taxes gratuity and coke adds up to the cost. This is way too much for a place like Charlotte!"}
{"text":"UNREAL. Delicious. Most places have a very bland Chicken Tikka Masala, but this is the most flavorful dish I've had in AGES. If I ever move from this city I have to ask Faraz to give me cooking lessons. All of the food was amazing. great levels of low heat so it's good for everyone to try. Get some spinach pakora as well--great starter and HUGE portions! 

If you aren't going to Tulips, are you really even eating Indian food?"}
{"text":"Very very unbalanced use of spices. While the owner might be overly nice to the customer, he doesn't know how to treat his employees. The use of cinnamon, clove overpowered the entrees we ate. A stone throw away, but I am not going there in the near future."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch buffet in University area because it was cheaper than other buffets. Wasn't expecting the best for $8 but a lot of the items weren't warm on the buffet. Furthermore my favorite general dishes (chicken masala , creamed spinach and cheese etx) were lacking the good flavors that make Indian food worth it. Disappointed  but again wasn't expecting too much for the price point. Still, I don't know if saving a few bucks is worth missing out on the awesome typical dishes! Hostess and waitress weren't that friendly. Felt like lacking strong AC on hot day as well (?fans only) . I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day.  The food is actually really good for a buffet type setting.  I wasn't really impressed with the service though.  We pulled up and the parking lot was completely empty- we thought the place was closed, but when we walked in most of the workers were putting out the food in the buffet line (it was around 11:30 am).  Some of the workers didn't really acknowledge us, but finally when the main hostess person came out she was nice enough to direct us to a table.  Someone brought us a thing of water and then left us.  We didn't know how it worked so we sat there a good while before we went around the corner and asked permission just to grab a plate (no biggie, but I do like a little direction now and then - before I get yelled at for doing the wrong thing).

Mostly Indian dishes at the buffet with some \"pan-asian\" pepper chicken and garlic chicken options.  I was addicted to the chicken tiki malsala and the fried cauliflower.  There was a lot of selection compared to the other Indian buffets in the area, but you do pay 9.99 for the lunch buffet.

When we were done, we had another moment where we wondered if we went up to the front to pay or not (which we eventually ended up doing), but overall it was an okay dining experience."}
