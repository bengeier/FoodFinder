{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese place in calgary! Great prices and the food tastes so fresh. Would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"This is my new goto Vietnamese restaurant. I usually like the vermicelli bowls. And these did not disappoint with hearty helpings."}
{"text":"The food here is alwyas good. Service is quick. You order and the food arrives hot and ready. You get lots of food. I think its good value. 

This is one of my favorite spots for pho."}
{"text":"Prior to an afternoon event with a gf, we wanted to grab a quick lunch and she suggested something \"healthy\" (I know her well enough that this is code for \"Vietnamese\") and I remember this place was close by. 

I've dined in and had take-out from here over the years, so I've tried a variety of banh mi, soups, noodles and rice dishes. For lunch, I went with the spicy beef vermicelli and my gf got spring rolls & shrimp on vermicelli - their vermicelli bowls are more veggies than noodles which I actually prefer. The spicy beef is great, not \"burns your mouth\" hot but has a nice kick.

Like most Viet restaurants, it has the same feel to it - Asian knick knacks/art work, instrumental music and friendly Viet ladies who chatter amongst themselves as you dine. Nothing super amazing here, but nothing terrible either which is why I don't mind coming here from time to time."}
{"text":"We like this place for takeout, it is consistently good stuff. I tend to get the tofu with vegetables on rice. I'm not a fan of fish sauce, but a little bit of hoisin is nice. Staff is friendly, and the place is usually busy."}
{"text":"Always friendly and prompt service, good quality food at a reasonable price. We are here at least once a week."}
{"text":"The portion sizes here are quite generous. I occasionally go here after school and I find they serve some of the best pho in NW Calgary.  The servers here are incredibly friendly and the food usually comes out quite quickly. I suggest the sate pho here as it is extremely tasteful with a mild capsaicin flavour. They have redecorated since the last time I have been there and the new marble tables are fitting for the restaurant decorations. It is situated in a somewhat remote location.  However, when you go here you're sure to return."}

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

I've been here numerous times, and it's one of the better Viet places in the NW. Their Pho has quite a tasty broth (sometimes kind of diluted and not as good as Pho Kim's), and their meat and tendon is super tender. The portion is perfect; there is often too much noodles for me to finish. 

I've also tried their Vermicelli bowls which is terrific and enjoy getting specifically here. It has plenty of rice noodles, bean sprouts, well seasoned and marinated meat, and plenty of spring rolls if you happen to order them with your bowl. Very good flavours.Their subs are alright ($6-$7) with flavourful meat served over a nice crispy baguette. I like getting the marinated chicken or satay which is not as spicy as I hoped but still has a nice balance of sweet, tangy, and salty. One thing I don't like about it is that they don't put enough 'stuff' inside the baguette so i end up eating a quarter of the sub in bread. 

The service is pretty good, serving you drinks once you sit down and very friendly. One time they forgot to add bean sprouts to my vermicelli bowl and they gladly took it back, adding the sprouts and reassembling all the toppings when I got it back. During school time, this place is busy and full during lunch so you have to have a minimum order of i think $5 (forgot the exact price) in order to sit down and eat. There is also almost always people in for dinner. 

Overall, I give this place a visit for some pretty decent Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"My favourite stop for chicken satay subs and crispy shrimp rolls to go!  I just wish they were open Sundays!"}
{"text":"Of all the Vietnamese food places I have tried in the Calgary, San Diego, and San Francisco - hands down - this one is still my favorite! Indeed it tends to get busy as the night approaches so be prepared. 

Their spring rolls & shrimp vermicelli bowls and their vegetarian pho are my favorite. 

I can't wait to come to Calgary for the summer to enjoy some soon!"}
{"text":"Really good veggie pho! Ordered takeout but no cutlery or sauce in bag. Also the noodles in the chicken vermicelli looked like they were the scraps! Otherwise very tasty and fast service!"}
{"text":"Kathy and her daughters Jade and Annie run this little place across the street from Sir Winston Churchill High School, tucked into the Dalbrent strip mall between a vacuum cleaner repair shop and Spice Rack (go there for East Indian groceries). While the decor is pretty basic, the food rocks -- especially the pho, which is so great for cold winter days. I tend to order either the grilled prawns on rice vermicelli or the chicken satay soup. My son likes the beef ball noodle soup. For appetizers, try the pork spring rolls and the grilled quail (it's marinated in their own house recipe barbecue sauce, available for purchase). I keep coming back because the food is good, the prices reasonable, and the service always prompt and pleasant. Be warned: they can get BUSY, so expect to wait on Fri and Sat evenings during the supper rush hour."}
{"text":"We happened to stumble on this restaurant by accident.  We were hungry and decided to give it a try.  It's a fairly busy restaurant for a Saturday lunch hour crowd.  

We ordered the 20A - appetizer plate consisting of charbroled beef wrapped with beetle leaves, spring rolls and salad rolls - 2 of each.  It was not bad and it came with 2 sauces - the fish sauce and the usual dipping sauce for the salad rolls.  I liked it and it was tasty.  Thought the spring rolls were a little smaller than usual.

I ordered the no. 27 - Satay Beef on Vermicelli Bun - it wasn't quite what I expected and it was all right.  I thought the beef would be charbroiled but it was just like a stirfry beef with a inty bit of satay sauce on the top.  Came with the usual vege and fish sauce.  Was not at all spicy and I had to put  more hot sauce to spice it up!  Another family member ordered the no. 6 - Beef with tendon Pho - the soup base was a little too diluted for me.  I had the a bit of the tendon and it was soft, which is a plus.

Tea is extra - $1.  

They have a special sauce that is packaged specially for them caled the Yummy Sauce.  It's a sweet sauce good for bbq, it says on the label.  It's also sold at the store.

They also have Vietnamese subs - asked if they have brown bread and they do not.  

When we left the restaurant, there was a bit of a line-up.  FYI - there are 2 round tables that can sit 6."}
{"text":"Nothing amazing about this place.  Service was ok, food was ok.  Came here because Pho Huong Viet was closed.  I like the fact that they have grilled beef wrapped in betel leaves.  Chinese people cooking Vietnamese cuisine.

Had the Bun with the beef wrapped in betel leaves and spring rolls.  The spring roll and beef were good, the sauce was lighter than most places, but I found that there wasn't enough meat for the amount of vermicelli/veggies."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I was praying that we wouldn't be sick after we left here - none of our food tasted fresh. Josh's vermicelli bowl only came with one spring roll, whereas most places include at least 2. I was excited about the Salad Rolls but discovered they had cilantro in them - a definite no for me - so that was disappointing. My Pho was okay, but a little bland - I had to add a lot of hoisin and hot sauce. The atmosphere and decor are really dated, and not in a cute way. The service was great though, and they were super nice. I probably wont be back - there are much better Vietnamese places in the NW."}
{"text":"Cheap & cheerful but I've had better In Calgary. Rice vermicelli was a bit stodgy. The Vietnamese place just to the south of Peter Lougheed Hospital does a much better, fresher bun."}
