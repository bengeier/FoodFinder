{"text":"Ok, I was trying to be adventurous for the group.  I don't really have a palate for Lebanese food, but it wasn't bad.  I am a huge fan of fatoosh salad and that was definitely a good choice.  The table ordered 4 dishes that included filet pieces and chicken pieces with rice, a ground meat concoction and a hummus appetizer.  The hummus was good.  The fillet and chicken were ok.  If I were talked into going again, I'd probably order a gyro next time."}
{"text":"Best gyro I've ever had. And it was also the biggest. Definitely recommend the hummus. And BYOB!"}
{"text":"Great Food. My favorites are the beef shawarma, hummus and grape leaves."}
{"text":"Kassab's is hands down my favorite place to eat in the South Side. My boyfriend and I love the food and the service and have dined here three or four times now. We always order too much because everything is so delicious we just can't narrow it down. Definitely the best Baba Ganoush around and you must have the house salad with Feta!"}
{"text":"This is very authentic Lebanese food.  The hummus and chicken shwarma (my two favorites) are both excellent.  The staff is polite and efficient.    Parking is always a nightmare on the South Side, so I only usually go on off hours (Saturday lunch).  But the food makes up for the frustration of looking for a place to park."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and wonderful food! We left very satisfied from Mezza Platter to Cream Carmel & Rice Pudding! Our group of four started the meal with the aforeparised Mezza Platter which had smooth hummus and Baba Ghannooj (my favorite!), feta, olives, pickled turnip and tabbouli (the traditional parsley/mint rather than mostly bulgur wheat) all served with pita. We were all very happy tasting and catching up. The patter did not stand much of a chance with us...  Entree included Loobyeh (green beans, rice, spices and tomatoes), Kafta Kabob, Falafel Platter, and traditional (with lamb) Moussaka. The entrees were served with a great salad-simple house salad but with tangy dressing and feta is became 0H-so-good! We all needed to take leftovers home but were not too stuffed to turn away dessert. Over coffees and shared Cream Caramel and Rice Pudding, we laughed and relaxed.  Our server was delightful and she patiently answered questions and attended us without any rush (and we took out good ole' time!)  Great unassuming restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Kassab's was a pleasant surprise when my friend and I accidentally ventured in there two years ago.     This is a great laid back restaurant because 1) I have never once had to wait for a table 2) everything on the menu is relatively inexpensive, I have never paid more than $15 including a starter and a meal, and 3) it is BYOB so it is perfect for a small get together with your friends because you will not have to worry about disturbing a crowded restaurant.  Additionally there is not a corking fee, at least there was not as of last summer.  I recommend the tabbouleh or tomato and mozzarella (actually its so big it could be a meal) for a starter, and  the grape leaves are great as well."}
{"text":"Best food on carson street! And a wonderful atmosphere. The service is always amazing. The food is always fresh and the portions are huge. One of my personal favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The food is really good. The staff were really courteous. If u go to this place have Kafta kabob. Ull love it."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this place for years, but have taken a break due to parking scarcity!  I'm glad I stoppped back in!   Had the moussaka and the creme caramel.  (Forgot to bring a bottle of wine...dang!)  Teh service was attentive the atmosphere was nice, but the food (though simple) was excellent!  I'll be going back because I have to re-try the lanb shank and the lamb sandwich!  BTW good for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place forever eating in or take out and the food has always been amazing.  The last three times we have ordered, have become more and more disappointing.  I knew I would never go back to Kassab's when we ordered the Chicken Shawrama and tabouli salad.  The chicken was dry, did not have any sauce, and the pita was crunchy.  The salad was not fresh, it was soggy and flavorless.  I called and asked to speak with the manager who refused to speak with me.  The waitress who relayed my complaint to the manager while I was on the phone with her was screamed at by the manager who I could hear yelling that the chicken was fine and the food is all fresh. The service here has always been iffy, but we put up with it because the food was always spot on...it seems that since they opened their bar the food has declined.  Not sure if the two are connected, but after hearing the way the manager spoke to the waitress, inadvertently addressing my complaint, we will not be returning to Kassab's.  They need to realize the importance of their customers and treat people with respect."}
{"text":"Simply the best Lebanese food that I've had in the States. Superb. The prices are also reasonable, and I've never had a problem getting a table right away."}
{"text":"Totally unimpressed....  Came here for lunch as I have been wanting to check this place out for sometime. There was definitely a lack of waitstaff for the lunch hour but they still did a pretty good job.Ordered the Baba gounosh as an appetizer and it was good really can't complain except for the fact that they gave us three pieces of pita to eat it with. I had to ask the server atleast three times to bring back some more.  The bread wasn't that great. I had a Chicken Shawarma, it was not very good, actually it was a joke. between the extremely overcooked chicken, poorwrap job and the fact it had absolutely no flavor. What's the point of coming back and trying something on their overpriced menu.The lovely special lady order a chicken gyro and it was basically just as bad except that it was drowned in Cucumber sauce and some feta cheese that they had the never to charge us an extra dollar for. Ali Baba is a better bet and the prices are better at Ali Baba. Thanks"}
{"text":"Service was good, fast, and friendly; food was okay and prices are fair, but nothing special overall. Admittedly, Middle Eastern food is not my favorite cuisine, but I've had some very flavorful chicken kabobs and shawarma ELSEWHERE that I really enjoyed. Not so much here.   The menu is pretty basic--consisting of mainly sandwiches, kabobs, falafel, and humus. There was no shawarma to be found.   So I had a chicken kabob. The chicken tasted like it had been marinated in salty dishwater. It came with a generous portion of rice and a salad that had a couple of tomato wedges, a slice of cucumber, and lots of feta cheese.  Filling, but nothing I will be in a hurry to go back for. Also, while not expensive, $14.99 for the above mediocre meal didn't exactly seem like a bargain either.  Bottom line: my one meal here seemed bland and slightly overpriced compared to what I've had at other Middle Eastern restaurants. However,  the hummus was good, so maybe it's worth trying something else another time."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. It's a simple setup and a straightforward Mediterranean style menu. The entrees don't include hummus, but if you order it as an appetizer you'll have enough to last at least three people through their meals.  The pita is served warm too. Which I know is something little, but it's a nice touch that makes a big difference to me.  Service was good too. We got our food reasonably quick, and our waiter was very courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"Another place I finally went to, then immediately kicked myself for never having eaten here!  Wife got the Grilled Lamb Pita, I got the Beef Schwarma Pita.  I got feta cheese, but on the side.  My wife does not like hummus, but her order came with it, so I said put it on the side.  Long story short, every aspect of the entire meal was great.  The lamb was tender and perfectly seasoned.  Same with the Schwarma.  And the hummus, the wife finished it off.  It was smooth, and tasty, delicious.  I am really used to hummus that is just a bit grainy, and  has a pronounced tahini and lemon flavor.  usually just on this side of bitter.  I mean, I like hummus, but I always assumed it was supposed to taste a little bitter.  The hummus here was a revelation.  It was smooth and creamy.  And the tastes were so mild, you could taste all of the individual ingredients, but it all blended into a smooth delicious flavor unlike anything I have ever had before with hummus.  It was GREAT!  The side of feta cheese was also something new and delicious.  And again, I was so used to feta cheese being hard, a little bitter, sharp tasting.  In this case, the feta was shredded.  It was smooth and tasty, and melted in my mouth.  The lamb and the beef schwarma pitas were every bit as good.  This place usurps every other middle eastern pita or wrap I have ever had anywhere, ever, at any time, ever in my life.  Ever.  I am off tomorrow as well, and am going to do the vegetarian thing.  In fact, up until now, my line had always been \"if all food was as good as Indian food, I would be able to be a vegetarian.\".  Now, the vegetarian thing includes this place.  I am going to update the review if I remember.  I was going to do Taj Mahal lunch buffet, but am coming back to Kassab's, and I am getting the sleek, the eggplant stuff, that parsley grain salad, etc (sorry, I dont remember the names of the items, but I know the ingredients!).  Thursday.  Vegetarian day at Kassab's.  I can't wait!  YUM!"}
{"text":"Excellent BYOB spot in south side.  There were some older guys kicking it here godfather style with vino flowing...table pounding, jokes and lots of laughter.  I'm not sure if that's the normal here but it created a fun enviroment.  Sad to say that I didn't know it was BYOB or we would have brought vino or beer beverages in.....tonight it was water for my SO and I...(SO meaning significant other).  We ordered the hummus and pita bread which was excellent.  I ordered the chicken house salad which comes with iceburg lettuce, toms, olives, cheese, cucumber, chicken.  HUGE!  The dressing is good stuff...Kevan (SO) ordered the spicy chicken sandwich which looked like a gyro.  I had a bite and could not even identify the spice but wow that kick was good!  The total cost $24 without tip.  I did notice there are some more expensive dinner style options here which i will go back and try no doubt (like the filet skewers).  This is a great place for some Lebanese style grub.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND and BYOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I were caught in the middle of a rain storm and ducked in here for a quick lunch. Man, we were pleased we did! The food here is great! I had a gyro sandwich and my friend had a grilled lamb sandwich. Both were outstanding and enormous. The baba ganoush was smokey and the portions were large. I would recommend Kassab's for anyone wanting some delicious, reasonably priced Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"Ordered Spinach Pie and Kafta Sandwich \"lebanese style\". Never had food that insulted my palette as much as this place in recent memory. The spinach pie had rock hard pieces throughout. When pointing it out to the server he snarkly replied \"uhhhh ohhhhhkay\". The Kafta never saw any sort of seasoning or the hummus the \"lebanese style\" had stated. What a disaster. Service was horrible. 4 minutes to receive a coke at a place that was more or less empty. No apology for the crappy spinach pie. Save your time and money. Plenty of other restaurants in Pittsburgh that will appreciate your business and deliver on basic customer service. This place fell way short."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our meal. Have had better Lebanese food in Pittsburgh but have had far worse. The green beans in the Loubieh was undercooked for me but the flavor was good. The Tabouli could have been chopped a bit more and was a bit dry. The lamb on my wife's Lamb Kebab sandwich was garlicky and delicious but didn't get to try the sandwich, my wife liked it and wouldn't share. The pita bread was great and the Hummus tasked good but I prefer it with a bit more texture. The staff was just ok not very attentive but don't have high expectations for the area."}
{"text":"Personally I like this place a lot.  They have pertty decent food.  The hummus is good, the baba is good, the pita is fresh, the servers are kind and quick to fill up your drink, and I really enjoy their fallafel.  Quantity is awesome.  Not the highest of quality as far as ingredients go."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and it never seems to disappoint. I come here because the food is nostalgic to when I was in Israel, especially the Shawarma. It's the next best thing in Pittsburgh. It comes fresh in a warm pita and has the option of de-kosherizing with a feta option, which I almost always do :) The atmosphere is warm and welcoming and draws a great lunch and dinner crowd. Make your next stop in the southside to Kassabs for an escape to a cultural oasis through Lebanese cuisine!"}
{"text":"Kassab's Lebanese cuisine caught my attention when I was walking down Southside. They have a 5 dollar sandwich deal which I was hesitant about. I ordered the chicken shawarma and was pleasantly surprised - the chicken was well cooked and seasoned, the ratio of tahini to yogurt contrasted the chicken nicely, and the portion size was definitely worth the 5 dollars. We also ordered an almond baklava which had great bite and texture to it.  The service and ambience were also welcoming and friendly.  TLDR: some of the best middle eastern/ Lebanese food you can get and phenomenal for its value (especially their sandwiches)"}
{"text":"Have been here quite a few times but last night was the first time we brought my 17 month old daughter. They have highchairs and crayons. We order her food off of regular menus so we had no issues finding her something to eat.  We ordered the portabella mushroom wrap, chicken schwarma, moussaka, and grilled vegetables. Everything was amazing. the best thing was probably the vegetables. They had feta cheese melted on top of them.  This is the first time we had been here since they put in the bar and it looks really nice. We didn't order any drinks but they seemed to have the basics.  Will definitely be back. It's just hard going on the weekend because parking in south side is tight."}
{"text":"The thing I love about this place, other than the fact that I love any and all Lebanese cuisine, is that even if you have a \"meh\" experience, you're never totally turned off. I've had great experiences and I've had the \"meh\" variety, but I never dock them for it. I don't know if it's the casual setting or the BYOB part, but I always enjoy my time there.  I highly recommend the hummus plate for starters, which I'm convinced is just Pitaland hummus and pita, but that's fine by me. Also, any of the lamb plates are great. The wraps are wonderful, but I think they do best with a full entree.   The only thing that sucks is that they're in the South Side, which I try to avoid a lot these days, but if you find parking then you're good to go. Grab a bottle and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been to Kassab's several times, both for sit-down dinners and for pick up orders to-go.  I've never been disappointed.    Usually, this is my go-to stop for a quick dinner to-go.  If you order falafel and hummus it's a perfect dinner and it is ready in 5-10 minutes.    For sit down dinners, I get fancy and try the other dishes.  My favorite is Kassab's moussaka.  The vegetarian and original offering are both delicious.  I always recommend it for those who aren't familiar with this type of food because it's just pure comfort food.  Pair this with hummus, baba, or their delicious tabbouli, and it's one of my favorite meals on the planet.  I've also had the kafta and shawarma, both the best I've had in Pittsburgh!   Finish your meal with some of their baklava, which I'm not usually a fan of, but theirs seems pretty good.    The service has always been very good.  The staff is extremely attentive and prompt.  Bring your own alcohol and save a little money, too, which is unique to just a few restaurants on the South Side.  Kassab's often looks empty when I pass, so I hope that more people treat themselves to this gem!"}
{"text":"Best gyro in Southside. Seriously!! The food hear is amazing if you really love authentic Mediterranean food. So many options and great quality.  I always get the hummus and the gyro platter. The hummus is to die for."}
{"text":"I've had all the middle eastern food this world has to offer and after moving to Pittsburgh from Los Angeles, this did make me a little less home sick. It really hit the spot! Will totally come back!!"}
{"text":"Delicious !! Just ate the mixed grill with kafta and chicken! Such huge portions and great taste! As an appetizer we had the spinach pie ! Recommend it !   Yum!!"}
{"text":"Their gyro meat is amazing!!!! The chicken kebabs...just okay.   Aside from that, the service here is horrific. Came here on a weekday night around 7:30pm, and there was only 1 server. It took 15 minutes to get menus and water, another 15 minutes for him to take our order, and then another 20 minutes go by until the server comes and tells you one of the items you ordered is sold out. Ummm...seriously? You couldn't have figured that out sooner? Add another 20 minutes before the food comes out. Then, when we were done eating, we couldn't get our server's attention for him to give us our check. I literally walked to the back of the restaurant and picked up the check myself.   But even with all that headache, I may consider coming back for that gyro meat."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever!  The best deal in town is the lamb shank dinner - it's so tender -cooked to perfection plus it's a huge portion.    It used to be BYOB here but now they have their own bar - you can still bring your own but they charge you for it.    It's been a while since I've been here (and I used to come here all the time) so I forgot how much I love the lamb, schwarma and falafel.   I'm sure I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! One of the best falafels I have ever had. The spicy chicken and lamb wrap are terrific! The lunch menu was recently updated and it now has a ton of $5 sandwich / wrap options."}
{"text":"Best stuffed grape leaves. I have yet to find a plce in pittsburgh where i enjoy their dolmas as i usually make my own and have since a child. These are delicious. Great wraps as well."}
{"text":"This place has been really good both times I have been there. The hummus is fantastic and the lamb is amazing. The salads and grape leaves were also crisp and delicious. It's a BYOB so we of course had wine with us.. The service is acceptable and the price isn't too bad."}
{"text":"Very very very good food. Very. Let me explain the reason for 3 stars.  At first, I felt so bad for our waitress. She was the only one waiting on like 8 tables. We came around 6pm for dinner and the longer we were there, the more people showed up. We ordered wine and my fiancé ordered a beer to sip on while we waited for our food. First we asked what kinds of wine they had. Her response was \"I don't drink so I really don't know\". She told us she would ask \"in the back\". We waited another 20 minutes and I finally pulled her aside to ask if she had checked on the wine (keeping in mind she was very busy and we didn't want to seem annoying). She then told us that \"the ladies in the back don't drink either so they don't know\". How do you not know what kind of wine you serve?? You don't have to drink to know this. This is your restaurant and we want to try a beverage. You really should know what you serve.   Long story short, we didn't end up getting our drinks until we were finished eating our dinner. I was really disappointed and again, felt bad for our waitress because she could only do so much. The food itself was 3 stars I would definitely go back, in spite of the poor service. Call me crazy, but it was that good. Two of us got the veggie moussaka and my fiancé got the lamb shank. Platter #1 was amazing and we had no room for dessert. Check out the pictures."}
{"text":"I went here twice the 2nd time we came the Waitress was a total bitch and very disrespectfull to my friends sister I've eaten better lebanese food! I've worked in a lebanese Resturant  not to say that the food sucks but the waitress we had was horrible!   and the food there is just ok cause like I said I've had better !"}
{"text":"I heard about Kassabs' in Southside today.  Not being able to get there, I was recommended to the newly opened Marathon Gas Station on Rt. 51, Brentwood.  Whaattt?  What does a gas station have to do with Lebanonese food?  Well, a lot!  They sell a scaled down version, a sampling if you will, of very delicious Lebanonese food.  Homemade grape leaves, baba ganoush, hummus.......umm!  The proprietor is the semi-retired chef of the Lamont Restaurant on Mt. Washington.  I'm sure when word gets around, and the snafu at Rt. 88 and Rt. 51 is over, this will be a go-to place for an excellent taste of Lebanon.  Did I mention how bright and clean it is?   :-)"}
{"text":"I eat at Kassab's quite frequently.  They have wonderful Sleek.  The prices are very reasonable, the food is freshly prepared, and everything is quite delicious.  The wait staff have always been very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"We love this place. I highly recommend the moussaka. The vegetarian is delicious as well as the regular moussaka. Today they're having a special on lamp shanks for 1099. This is very tempting for a new vegetarian. I'm sure that's absolutely fantastic like everything else here."}
{"text":"Real Greek food, lamb on a spit, HUGE portions, and a very comfy overall feel to this place. Staff is friendly...I'd totally go back :-)"}
{"text":"I have gone past this place so many times and never knew it existed. Going here was a nice little surprise for dinner with the boy.   Server was nice, service was fast.   Grape leaves were pretty good, hummus was delish, and the lamb pita wrap I had was pretty awesome. I'd go again."}
{"text":"I stopped in here to grab a falafel wrap before a hair appointment, and my goodness, that was easily the best falafel wrap I've had possibly ever.  It was fast, filling, and delicious.  Not too much sauce--just enough to moisten the contents--and even then, without it, the falafels would not have been too dry.  I really hope I get some more time to come back and do a full sit-down and really see a good spread."}
{"text":"Man, I was impressed with this place. I went in and it seemed like a pretty unpretentious spot tucked in the array of restaurants in the South Side. My girlfriend ordered the falafel sandwich and it was godly tasting. I got this awesome comfort food type dish listed as Vegetarian Moussaka that consisted of layers of eggplant, zucchini, mixed vegetables, cous cous AND mashed potatoes topped with Parmesan cheese. Maybe it's because I am a small town fella but I thought that was a pretty darn unique combo. Anyway, would recommend. Great Greek spot for a quick Saturday afternoon lunch."}
{"text":"Decent grub, although the grape leaves sucked and the service, while quick, was RUDE. No atmosphere. Much better Med food in the 'burgh."}
{"text":"Seriously? Surprised this place has a 4 star review.  Lamb and Chicken was griddled, over cooked and very bland.....something I would expect to find at a cheap East Coast diner. Stopped by based on reviews but will not be coming back and wouldn't recommend based on the food."}
{"text":"I love Kassab's. The food is always super tasty and quite possibly the best hummus and baba in the city! The falafel is outstanding... crunchy exterior yet smooth interior and never greasy.  The portion size is enormous for the price. We had the mezza platter and three entree salads for $60!"}
{"text":"I consider Kassab's a definite staple for vegetarians who are looking for a place to eat on the Southside and who enjoy affordable prices.    With all the bars on Carson Street, Kassab's is a breath of fresh air.  It's never been too crowded for me to sit down, the service is quick, and the food is quite tasty.  Thank goodness for Kassab's!"}
{"text":"The good - generous portions (though not cheap), good flavors - the mezze platter was very good, as were the kefta kebabs. The bad - 1) some items were dry, like old pita and overcooked chicken kebabs; and 2) lazy, disengaged service. Our waitress was more interested in sitting in the back of the restaurant on her laptop than in serving us or the handful of other tables. My recommendation - a decent option for a quick sandwich, but not a dinner destination."}
{"text":"I would give u 0 rating. We sat waiting table and nobody came for 20 mintues. Bad service. It would first and last time. I left before i got seated"}
{"text":"Hands-down best Lebanese food in Pittsburgh!  I work nearby Kassab's, so I find myself ordering from here A LOT. I mean, like, a falafel-sandwich-at-least-once-a-week A LOT. Their falafel sandwich, which I greatly prefer to their falafel platter, is probably the best falafel sandwich I've ever had. The sandwich includes lettuce, tahini, pickles, the crunchiest balls of falafel (ever), and tomatoes - feta optional (but ohhhh, so worth it). Everything is served on fresh and delicious pita bread.  The sandwiches here will run you about $6-10 a pop, but they're larger than most sandwiches. My wallet always urges me to split my sandwich into two meals, but I assure you, eat it in one sitting! The pita's always soft and fresh, so it tends to get soggy if left overnight.  I've only dined in once and the service was efficient and friendly. No qualms here. Cute Mediterranean-inspired decor as well."}
{"text":"Always one of my favorites in Pittsburgh's Southside. The falafel sandwich with a side of hummus. Unique and delicious. Very cool space with a large brick wall."}
{"text":"This is my favorite middle eastern restaurant in pittsburgh.  It's like going to my grandmother's house for dinner!"}
{"text":"Best grilled lamb sanwich on the face of the earth, awesome grape leaves!! don't forget the hummus"}
{"text":"My favorite Lebanese place.  I have been coming here since they were on the corner of tenth.  My favorite falafel sandwich... The pickles are key.  I also like the kefta sandwich.  My wife always gets a chicken sandwich or tawook.  The hummus and baba ganouj are also good.  One of the few places where I'll eat all vegetarian.  I always stop here when I come back to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I often say, you can can measure the greatness of a restaurant if you keep going back because you're craving the cuisine.  For me, Kassab's is certainly one of these places.  Unfortunately, because I have fallen in love with a selection of the dishes, we always end up ordering some combination of the following : Dolmeh (with meat), Spicy Chicken (really spicy!), Kafta, or Shawarma sandwiches, Lamb kabob (grilled to a medium rare perfection and served with almond rice and smokey grilled onion), Spinach pie (like spanikopita).  So, I have yet to venture off of these staples and continue to try new items! Another favorite: the house dressing; it's a yogurty sauce spiced with garlic and lemon juice- maybe their house tahini?  Whatever the ingredients, this tangy  concoction is amazing!  The restaurant itself is small, and we have never needed to make reservations (both pluses in my book, especially when I'm needing to satisfy a craving!)  Of course, one of the other attractive qualities of Kassab's is that it's BYOB, and there's no corkage fee! I absolutely love this place, and will definitely be going back for more  :)"}
{"text":"I've had my share of Medditterranean meals, I live in a very foodie city aka DC.  Kassab, however, is a pleasant surprise in Pittsburgh.  Perhaps one of the best fattoush I tasted outside of Israel.   What to order?  Portion sizes are HUGE.  There was three of us and we still had plenty of food left, considering we didn't order that much.   1.  Falafel.  They came in donut shapes and taste freakin' amazing. 2.  Mezza plate:  hummus, baba ghanoush.  Lots of pitas.  3.  Lamb kabob.  I know my lamb.  This was damn good lamb. 4. Spinach pies.  They sure don't skimp on their spinach:)  Finally, polish your dinner with an order of baklava.  I especially liked their cashew baklava."}
{"text":"We eat here frequently.  Try the lamb shank -- my wife's favorite.  I like the baked kibbee, and the hummus and  tabbouli by themselves will fill you up -- very generous portion."}
{"text":"A little taste of home for me. Kassab's also has the classic Lebanese restaurant decor that I definitely miss. I've only been once because I'm rarely in South Side, but I still dream about it...  I recommend ordering a mezze sampler, which has all of the classic Lebanese goodies (tabbouleh, falafel, hummus, etc) made to perfection. However, you must not leave without trying the sleek! Sleek is a lesser-known Lebanese dish that consists of stewed greens with black-eyed peas. It is lemony, wholesome, and all around amazing."}
{"text":"I've never had anything other than the falafel sandwich and hummus. The hummus has a texture that I've never had anywhere else and it makes it 10X better than anywhere else. The falafel is delicious. Reasonable prices. Always an excellent waitress, though they could use at least one more. I'm always there for lunch rush and the girl is insanely busy. Definitely a great place to check out if you're into this type of cuisine."}
{"text":"Good authentic Lebanese food at a low price."}
{"text":"Not too impressed , very crowded ,Loud , poor seating , Gyro had little to no flavor, Expensive , Poor parking. Sorry Guy's ,I wont be back."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I was a kid and it was on 10th street. In fact, I used to live behind them and be tortured by the smells. When I used to travel with my boss, we would just order a bunch of falafel wraps to go from the woman that used to answer the phone by yelling, \"KASSAB!\" Awesome roadtrip food.   Now, more often, I get the portabella wrap. It's messy, but worth it and you can just eat the last few bits with a fork. Great pickled veggies and hummus.  It's gone more upscale since the old days, but also pricier. Oh well, glad they can survive the rents on Carson."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a cold January afternoon with the family, shopping and strolling Carson Street's funky shops when the hungry hit us hard. The kids and I all got Gyros, which were huge and delicious, packed with meat and fresh vegetables and just the right about of sauce, while my wife scored the shawarma. We weren't interested in getting a wide variety for yelp-reporting purposes. We wanted the feedbag. Yum. The kids and I agreed the Gyros were top notch, and Mrs. Junk raved on the shawarma, which was also tasty. The huge portions left us stuffed, even without side dishes, the place was spotlessly clean and warm on a cold day (so many restaurants keep the thermostat low, and then there's that door opening and closing (I'm talking to you, Ramen Bar) brrrrrrr). Finally, the server--a tallish young guy--was friendly and attentive, filling my water glass as fast as I could drink, etc. All in all, an excellent lunch for about $35 for 4. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. Great prices, great food. Highly recommend the lamb shank. Sometimes service is shoddy but the food is definitely worth going."}
{"text":"Kassab's has a really good falafel sandwich. They were very generous with the falafel serving; and, for $5.99 it was a great price for a quick, tasty meal before an evening at City Theater. Out of the few restaurants I've grabbed a quick bite from before heading to a show, this is perhaps my favorite. It's quick, the service is good, the prices are relatively inexpensive even for a dinner platter, and the food is tasty.  It may not be an ideal location for impressing a first date before a show because the interior does resemble a nice cafeteria. Personally, I wouldn't mind, but that's just cuz I'm a cheap date :)"}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy in my tummy, tummy, tummy!  I've been going to this place since I was in college...so let's just say for a long time.  I used to go to the original location when they were at the corner of 10th and East Carson and followed them as they moved to 12th and East Carson.  Although I wouldn't consider myself a regular, I do get cravings for this place from time to time.    I usually get the stuffed grape leaves - meat please!  And the falafel sandwich or platter.  Make sure you go with company b/c it's too much food to eat alone especially if you get an appetizer.  I recently tried the baba ganoush and it was delish and flavored perfectly.    FYI - They only accept cash if your order is under $10.00.  But if over $10 buckaroos, feel free to use a credit card."}
{"text":"Great Lebanese food at a great price. Kafta and hummus are awesome. They have raw kibbee on Saturdays!"}
{"text":"Well I don't have much to review because we left due to bad service. This is a typical restaurant for South Side, old building, pretty clean, simple, more of a bar with an eating space, than a restaurant.   We were sat at a table right next to the door in the middle of walkway practically, we asked to move but they said they were expecting a large party to take up the back area. So we stayed, ordered the hummus, which i read was the best in the burgh...ugh, it was super runny and not too good, the stuff from the store is better. Dont know why people would think this is good, not bad, but really not good at all.   Our waitress was busy setting up the room for a party of 30 she said, as a result we sat while staff were carrying tables and clanging chairs around us for 10 minutes, highly annoying. They are leaving your table before they put down what was in their hands, they seemed bothered to wait on us. Just wasn't an atmosphere to relax or enjoy food so we left.   Had the service been better we would have stayed for dinner, maybe it would have been good. When will places understand that alot of us are not out just to shove food in our faces and leave, we want a good experience, I can cook myself, I go out for the experience."}
{"text":"I really like the sleek with fried onions- parking is a snap because there is a surface lot a few doors down on Carsen.  The fallafel and gyros are both very good.  I also think the meaaz plater is a good deal- very good baba and humos- grape leaves are good but not great- I highly recommend this no frills middle eastern restaurant."}
{"text":"Kassab's is one of my favorite places for lunch on the Southside of Pittsburgh.  Great ambiance with perfect lightning and the huge colorful wall mural/painting (wow - I remember the hole-in-the-wall old location on the corner many years ago - monumental improvement to say the least).  Kassab's usually has very quick and friendly service despite the fact that the 1 or 2 servers are covering a very busy lunch crowd. I always seem to get my unsweetened ice tea refilled once or twice just when I need it.  I need to expand and explore the selection of dishes that I try at Kassab's.  I usually go with the lamb pita sandwich (with no cheese) - incredible.  This does NOT seem like a healthy option because they cook the ground lamb with a quite a bit of oil but very yummy.  The add a touch of hummus on the lamb sandwich which makes it perfect.  Another favorite at Kassab's is the baba ganoush with pita.  I have mixed feelings and results from the falafil pita sandwich at Kassab's - I am pretty picky about my falafil.  The Kassab's version is huge compared to most but could sometimes use a little more flavor, sometimes a tad mushy.  I think there are better falafil options in Squirrel Hill - hey maybe a Talk thread is in order on this topic!   Similar to some other Yelpers, I am NOT a big fan of warm grape leaves from Kassab's (and the tabouli could use a little kick in the @$$) but perhaps those 2 are made in the Lebanese style?  I am looking forward to trying new things on the menu someday soon!"}
{"text":"This is a very reasonable restaurant with great service. I wasn't blown away by the quality of the food, but the quantity is in the right place. Two of us ordered two starters and an entree and left very full. I'd equate the food to Middle Eastern comfort food, a little bland, a little drab, but will fill you up every time and leave you satisfied.   Also, they still have  no corkage fee, though they supply stemware and open the bottle with absolutely no qualms.   Overall, this is a good standby place for eating out on a weeknight. It would be a good place to introduce your less adventurous friends to eating Middle Eastern food with its helpful waitstaff and some reliable food."}
{"text":"We used to live on the same street as Kassab's and this was our go to place for take out. The Beef Shawarma was what I usually gravitated towards, but I have also had their spicy fish sandwich, portobello sandwich, steak sandwich, filet sandwich- all delicious. My boyfriend loved the chicken shawarma, but it was a little too dry for me so I normally opted for something else on the menu.   The Mjaddara and Filet Kabob are also excellent as main dishes. The grape leaves and Baba Ghannoj were our favorite of the appetizers. I am not big on Falafel but our friend swears by the ones here. We would also order some pita, the red sauce (served with the filet kabob and lamb), and their homemade salad dressing on occasion as well if cooking at home and wanted a taste of Kassab's. The staff were always very nice and even got to know our orders.    The only down side to Kassab's is now we live 9 hours away and really miss our Lebanese fix. Good thing we still have family in Pittsburgh :)"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Pittsburgh.  The flavor are great and the food is incredibly fresh.  Four of us went and had tons of food-grape leaves, hummus, falafel, tabbouleh, lamb shanks and great salads for $85 without tip.  This is one of the best places for Middle Eastern food in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"I've traveled the world over,And I've eaten in every well recommended Lebanese restaurant I could find. Not only are the flavors exemplary and the service magnificent, this restaurant will go down as one of the most consistent restaurants I've had the pleasure of eating at. I've been a loyal customer for the last 10 years and will continue to do so as long as they're in business."}
{"text":"Two couples met here for lunch on a weekday. One person was still full from breakfast and so ordered only a hummus plate--so creamy! One person got the red lentil soup (sign on the door, not listed on the menu) and a falafel sandwich. Both were excellent. One diner ate half a gyro (pronounced gear-oh, if memory serves). The last stuffed herself with half a plate of sleek (cooked spinach and beans) and half a warm falafel sandwich. So much food! So tasty. And well priced, especially for bottomless drinks and leftovers."}
{"text":"I came in here for lunch on a Thursday - the place was empty, which made me sad, but it meant that I got my take-out chicken shawarma sandwich very quickly.  The server was funny and friendly, and offered me a glass of water while I waited.  The sandwich came out in only a few minutes, and was big enough for me to make 2 small meals out of it.  It was hot, with seasoned chicken inside, along with lettuce, tomato, and nutty tahini sauce.  Actually, I'm craving one now just thinking about it. I was surprised that they weren't more busy, given the friendly service and fresh, tasty food.  I hope to have the chance to come back soon - I'm almost never on the South Side, but I'd definitely return if I was nearby again."}
{"text":"The grape leaves are the best I've ever had. However there is only one server for the entire place so service is really slow. For example, I've been here for 17 mins and still don't have my water."}
{"text":"This is the best Lebanese food I've ever had anywhere. Used to be a regular at this place until I moved to Boston last year and every time I fly back into Pittsburgh, Kassabs is the first place I go to for food. All the food is amazing but the Shawarma is out of this world. Best place to sit back with a drink, listen to some traditional music, and eat some of the most delicious food you've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Places like this are great because I feel like no matter how many people I tell about it, I know it'll never get overrun; it's just looks too plain to ever go supernova. Even though Kassab's doesn't promise much from the outside, or inside for that matter, it has some of the best food I've ever scooped, licked or scraped off a plate.   Before eating here I think I thought Lebanese food fell under the umbrella term \"Mediterranean\" for me, kind of like how El Salvadorian food was a synonym for \"Mexican\" before I ever ate a pupusa. Of course, I was totally wrong on both counts.  My first experience with Kibbeh (a Saturday-only special) went surprisingly well considering I had no idea what I was ordering and I received a large football-shaped pile of raw lamb. Kibbeh is ground lamb mixed with crushed wheat and sided with raw onions, pickled beets and pepperoncini.   This might still be sounding borderline gross so just let me say that the texture was a big part of the appeal of the dish and that anything you put on pita and top with hummus and pickled beets has to be pretty good.   Speaking of hummus and baba ganoush-they were both as smooth, creamy and luxurious as a glass of organic whole milk. There's something beautiful about making a perfect appetizer by puréeing a few great ingredients together and serving them on warm bread.  Warm dolmathes that were plump and slightly buttery in flavor made me feel like I'd never eaten one before, so if you've never had one make sure this is your first. If you have had one before, go here and get the nasty briny taste of the canned versions out of your mouth.   The sauce served with lamb skewers was mostly a thin tomato base with a light sweet hit of cinnamon swirling under the savory: drizzled over the rice and with a fat little piece of lamb made for a very satisfying bite.  And BYOB seals the deal."}
{"text":"This is one of the best middle eastern restaurants I've been to. I'm not a big fan of Lebanese food in general, but the chicken shawarma exceeded my expectations. The meat was flavorful, warm, and tender and they had a variety of vegetables inside. The flavors were complementary. Overall, I was impressed with the meat.  We also ordered an almond baklava, which was good as well. It was quite sweet and sticky, which is what you'd expect from good baklava.   The best thing though, was that the chicken shawarma was only $5! Definitely come if you want some quality Lebanese food with low prices."}
{"text":"Wow!  I love, love, love this place!  So good!  I was a bit skeptical about going to an ethnic food place in Pittsburgh because I've visited before and not had good luck.  Kassab's has prooven me wrong.  We had the Yogurt Salad and Moussaka with Mint Ice Tea.  I highly recommend this small whole in the wall to all that love Mediterranean / Lebanese cuisine and are fans of great service and a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best food and service ever! I have never tasted hummus so delicious! The lamb just melted and tender - clean- nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"I've got two compliments. My girlfriend and I both ordered the vegetarian sampler and the server said that we should just split it, it's enough for two. And so it was. I LOVE staff that is interested in customers having a good experience rather than a big check. Also my friend had an off menu coffee drink request. They made it no problem. The food was good, lots of vegetarian choices and I liked the vibe. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wow... Who writes these reviews??? The food is pretty good but the service is horrible!!! We ate on 9/6 and the girl working there is BAD!!  Management needs to make some changes."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite restaurant in the Southside. If I am looking for something quick and easy to pick up I order the $5 falafels to go. Every time that I have dined in, the service was great and I have never left unhappy. The only thing that I would change is the wine selection. I wish they had something better than barefoot. Overall, A+"}
{"text":"A nice middle eastern style restaurant with a good selection of food. I really like the baba ganoush. Very creamy and smoky. Their pita  read seems.to be fresh and home made, and very thin and chewy.  I.had the lamb kabob sandwich,  the meat was well cooked and tender. I.liked the yogurt sauce too.  The falafel my nephew ordered was a bit different from how I have ever seen it, much lighter brown, drier, and more crumbly. It was ok, but I personally prefer it how I have usually seen it. Maybe it is a regional style I have not seen before.  Overall a good place, with good food."}
{"text":"Cute little BYOB Lebanese place on Carson Street.  I love the exposed brick and stark wood tables.  The food is great.  Wild Rice appetizer is so richly flavorful that it's hard to believe it's meatless.  The hummus is smooth and creamy, and the lamb shank falls off the bone."}
{"text":"The hummas at this place had no taste whatsoever very bland... The grape leaves were a nothing special and be sure if you put a special request in to make sure that its done properly when it gets to the table because if you happen to take one bite of it they will charge you for it even though it was their screwup!! And last but not least make sure your servers are writing down what you want they tend to forget to bring simple things like the drink you ordered."}
{"text":"A foursome of lovely ladies were looking for a place to eat some good cheap food and we were directed to Kassab's by our Pittsburgh resident.  Kassab's is definitely not fussy, but I liked that more.  Service was very pleasant and attentive.  The Mezza platter was great and perhaps even too much for the four of us to share.  I ordered the falafel sandwich and found it to be quite good, but perhaps a bit on the dry side.  They skipped the tzatziki sauce, but no worries as I just got some on the side.  My dining mates shared the Kafta platter and it was too much for them.  In fact, all of the food was excessive.  You definitely get your money's worth.  We had lots of leftovers.  I only wish I had left room for some of the Baklava."}
{"text":"This place has amazing gyro's. i never knew a gyro could have such flavor coming from a place not named for it's gyro's. The interior is nice and cozy with tall ceilings and greek mural drawings on the wall. I really enjoy the ambiance. We always go for lunch when it's not too busy. I get their lamb gyro with cheese. The feta cheese they put on top makes taste even better. The taste of fresh tomatoes and lettuce, plus their sauce is outta this world. It's probably the best gyro on the south side.  I've never tried too much of their other food except their meat pie which is store bought not freshly prepared so those i would have to say were pretty bad. they were very dry! Just bread and ground beef with no real flavor. we pushed it to the side while waiting for our gyro. I read that the grape leaves weren't too appetizing so it leaves me to wonder what else this place has to offer?  Update, I tried the grape leaves and they were ok. A little on the tender side and by tender I mean too soft. I've had better before so I guess that's what I am comparing them too."}
{"text":"Thank you GOD. I had some hummus. I also had some babaganoush and when I asked him if they used mayonaise in it, he said \"why would we do that? Who does that?\" BLISS. I had the lamb shwarma sandwich--great, reasonably priced and shared the appetizer platter with hummus tabouli and baba and they had the pickled turnips...you can't even know how much those turnips mean to me. When I discovered this place I felt that I could live in Pittsburgh, because every city needs to have food that keeps you coming back and this is the ethnic comfort food I am looking for."}
{"text":"Going with three stars for Kassabs it is more greek-american style than authentic lebanesey middle eastern cuisine.  Though some of the dishes i wish leaned a little more towards traditional lebanese cue in Tabbouleh, it either usually has too much parsley or too little, not enough mint or lemon.  The hummus is just ok i know its one of those things, you like it or you don't I don't mind salty hummus but just a tad more garlic and it would be good.  Kafta: Ive had it before it and it was like-able no big issues but, then I had it a second time it was wayyyyyyy over-spiced. It was served in a wrap with pickled beets, chopped green spicy peppers, and ground lamb meat. The meat was a little overcooked and over-spiced when paired with the spicy pepper Aden tomato. It was a lot going on all at once, the beet and but remember salty. The peppers - needed to be toned down too many = too much spice, the parsley- slow down on it there are other herbs. It left me wondering it if they had a new chef?   The falafel: ok kind of hard to screw this one up, I will say it tastes like its made from a mix and it is a bit dry. Shout out to O'falafel in salt lake city who make their's in a burger patty shape keep it soft and moist in the middle and crispy on the outside and use fresh herbs mmmmmm.   I have never had a bad experience with the service, one server is pretty tall dark and handsome I cannot complain about parking, there are side streets behind Carson which is nice. Which is what gets this place more than a 2 star review, If you're a foodie sort of you will not love this place.  If you like more Greek style cuisine you will like it, the decor is nice bathroom was spotless."}
{"text":"Friday Night on Pittsburgh's South Side can be a harrowing adventure during which one can expect to encounter many varieties of the drunken yahoo. Recently, I caught a concert at The Rex Theater on that favored time of the week for 9-to-5'ers and was in need of belly fuel. It was then that I remembered Kassab's, an eatery I had not been to since joining Yelp 5 years ago. Thus, I'd found dinner.  Having been fixated on gyros of late, I ordered one up and waited for a spell at a window seat whilst sipping on an effervescent ginger ale, taking in the nocturnal parade of hipsters, yuppies, bros, bimbos, drunks, punks, freaks, and attention-seekers on infamous Carson Street.   Kassab's interiors merge the modern and urban with the rustic and folksy. Vibrant murals seemingly came to life on the walls as patrons chattered happily beneath them.  As big as a rolled-up newspaper. Kassab's gyro could best be described as a lamb meatloaf wrap. The pita was more like a tortilla in that it was thin and somewhat bubbled and charred. The meat itself was butter-soft, my canines sinking through it easily. Filling it out was the standard lettuce-tomato-onion trinity with a tangy, creamy, white condiment that Kassab's calls \"Tahini sauce.\" Call it tzatziki, yogurt or whatever you prefer -- this is what makes or breaks gyros, and the sauce certainly made it sing in this instance. While not reaching the gastronomic highs that other gyros in the Pittsburgh area have achieved in regards to my palate (see It's Greek To Me, Knossos, Lesvos, Mike & Tony's, Central Diner & Grille), Kassab's take on the Greek staple is as worthy a contender as you'll find.  For dessert, I opted for a serving of their fascinating rice pudding. Thick like a custard, the pudding was seasoned with something quite occult that nearly intoxicated me with its licorice flavors. With my curiosity piqued so, I asked my excellent server about the secret ingredient but couldn't hear what he told me over the clatter (was this purposeful?). Nonetheless, the pudding was a marvelous and mysterious way to end my meal.  The long, plump gyro and chilly, rich pudding kept me bangin' long into the early morning hours with not a single hunger pang. With so much upheaval occurring in the South Side, don't overlook Kassab's lest you miss out on some mighty fine and fairly economical Greek fare your damn self."}
{"text":"Not for everybody, but we enjoyed it. The sleek appetizer was really good. Entrees were fairly priced, decent sized, and really good. Service was fine.  A great place for a casual meal with some different flavors."}
{"text":"Met with friends yesterday and shared the hot mezza platter which exceeded our expectations, and was more than enough for three of us. The rice pudding was a great way to complete our feast. The real plus is the wait staff. Attentive, knowledgeable and there when we were ready for coffee refills, etc. -- made us feel like family. We recommend this establishment and agree that it is is a gem.  We will all be back soon."}
{"text":"When you are up for something different, head to Kassab's. In the heart of the crowded South Side, the interior is refreshing and spacious, the service and fare are good.   The hummus is quite good, but the chicken and filet kabobs are both done well! The fatoosh salad also boasts a great mix of herbs. Overall, Kassab's was worth the time and I will be heading back."}
{"text":"I've had Shawerma that melts in your mouth.  Not here. The sandwich is more like a wrap than a traditional Shawerma - I should have realized that when they asked if I wanted Provolone on it. It's not that bad, it's just not what one thinks of when ordering a Shawerma.  Their version has the meat, herbs, onions, tomato, and lettuce tightly wrapped in something a little thicker than a tortilla but a lot thinner than pita bread.  It's also kind of on the expensive side - $8 without a side.  Most people were ordering salads.  Perhaps that's what I should have done."}
{"text":"Kassab's is a pretty space in the South Side specializing in Lebanese cuisine. The walls are painted with various Mediterranean and Middle Eastern scenes, offset by the light coming in through the front windows. We were invited to find a seat on our own and waited on by the most efficient waiters I've ever seen. The restaurant got crowded, busy, and he never stopped - but everyone got great and timely service.  The menu is fairly standard, with lots of vegetarian and vegan offerings, grape leaves, pickled veggies, salads. Meat-eaters get the other half of the menu, with lamb, spicy chicken, shawarma, steak and gyro offerings. We ordered a veggie platter, with pickles, onions, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers and feta; and a hummus to go with - great for making little bites with all the ingredients.  I ordered a spicy chicken wrap, and the spouse a mixed grill platter. Both were excellent - grilled lavash bread with a marinated chicken breast, plenty of veggies and yogurt sauce. The spouse had a delicious tomato-y sauce to dip his meats in, and lots of rice. One of our companions had a gyro platter - big chunks of gyro meat with all the ingredients on the plate. Everything was tasty, and we could add the hummus, sauce, and bits from our appetizer to the mix. The portions were ample, but we did not leave much on any plate.  Our server was a whirlwind of activity, getting our order, bringing our coffee, and then our appetizers all right on time, all with a friendly and unhurried manner. Other tables were coming in and were not left to wait, either. An excellent choice for lunch on Carson."}
{"text":"We were the only ones in the restaurant. Service was fast, hummus was fresh, pita bread was hot. Avoid the baklava, as it was rather dry. They use a walnut filling rather than pistachio."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, and great lunch special deals. I tried the lamb shank and added a side salad for $2. The salad was huge and well seasoned with a yogurt sauce. I had a lot of lamb and rice to take home with me. Drop by for a quick bite - good whether you're alone or with company."}
{"text":"A little bummed.  I expected more from this place.  It's been around forever and one of those places you've heard is solid.  One of those places I was embarrassed I hadn't tried yet because it's been around for so long!  I've been on a Greek food kick lately so I was craving some grape leaves.  Recently I've had some really awful grape leaves at the Arts Fest (I know, what was I thinking!) and some really awesome ones at another festival that has a strong Greek heritage in the community.  I like chilled grape leaves that are tightly wound.  The grape leaves here are loosely wound and a tad on the  mushy side.  The really awful ones I had were super mushy and unedible.  These were still good, had an okay lemon flavor, but they were served warm and I felt like they may not have been marinated long enough.  Not impressed  I also ordered the Tabbouli which had WAY too much parsley and not enough of the goodstuff... onions and tomatoes.  It also said it came with fresh warm pita bread.  I did not get that pita bread.  Which brings me to my next point...  The server was miserable.  From start to finish I knew she did not want to be there.  Serving to me is fakin' it til you make it!  You gotta work for that tip... I mean, if you're a server you usually have to have some kind of personality, right?  Even if she did, it was not her day.  I think that's why I did not get my pita bread.    Honestly, not having the best experience, I don't know if I'd be back."}
{"text":"This place is a gem in the South Side. Lamb shank, sleek and my favorite Pittsburgh falafels is my happy place.  Do yourself a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"Love this place. work in the southside and get food from here weekly. generous portion of tabbouli and the baba ghanouj is delicious."}
{"text":"Good food and great service . We went there Saturday afternoon and it was not too busy which was great for us since we have kids"}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Great food friendly service .   We had an absolute feast. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This may be my favorite take out spot. My co-workers and I order from here at least once a week. The food is always quick, hot and cooked perfectly.  My favorite: the portabella wrap with provolone.  Just a note: Kassab's has a very nice dining room. I just choose take-out because I work nearby."}
{"text":"If you love Middle Eastern food then Kassab's is the place for you and if you haven't been here in a while, I urge you to come to check out the beautiful new decor and full bar that was recently added to the restaurant!  They seriously have the best hummus in town - nothing fancy just traditional hummus but it is so creamy and silky with just the right amount of spices - it is a MUST if you go there.  My favorite two dishes other than the stellar hummus are the falafel wrap and the lamb wrap.  On my most recent visit my friend and I both got the House Special Salad.  I typically shy away from salads with only iceberg lettuce but I ordered it and oh my lord it was absolutely delicious! Their house-made dressing with shredded feta cheese is to DIE for!  I don't think that I've enjoyed an iceberg salad so much in all my years!  Both the regular Moussaka and Vegetarian Moussaka are fab as well!  One of my friends swears by the Kafta, too, which I have yet to try, but boy did it look delicious.  If you have room for dessert (which is unlikely) then I highly recommend the baklava paired with a cup of their delicious coffee!"}
{"text":"I like Kassab's. Their Mezza platter was very good and filling. It included hummus, baba ganoush, feta, olives, vegetables, and tabouli with warm pita bread.   I wasn't blown away by the taste or quality of the entrees or desserts. I ordered the moussaka, which was rather dry and bland. My boyfriend ordered the chicken kebab. He also commented that his dish was bland, and kept topping his chicken with the delicious hummus and tabouli to flavor it up. One of his favorite desserts is baklava, so we ordered some. Very dry. If you like rosewater, then you will like their baklava, because the flavor is quite dominant.    I vacillated between three and four stars. I really enjoyed the Mezza platter. The waitress was kind, and the prices were reasonable. I simply wanted to be more impressed by the main course(s). I think its a great place to bring a friend who wants to venture into more \"exotic\" foods, but doesn't want to be blown away by spices."}
{"text":"Usually i don't post any reviews but what i saw there last night made me want to do. Simply it doesn't worth the money we spent there. The guy who work there was rode. And the chicken was very bad. But to be honest the we had hummus falafel and and shawrma as appetizers it was very delicious. I liked those stuff more the the kabab."}
{"text":"The BEST, no exaggeration, THE BEST MIDDLE EASTERN FOOD in the area!   Consistent, delicious, delightful staff, clean, inexpensive, and just overall fabulous place to eat.   It's one of the few places that I always say we don't eat there enough. Despite the casual environment, we have introduced the restaurant to many people and everyone always raves and loves it.    The dinner platter sizes are large.  I suggest splitting or being prepared to take food home unless you're really hungry.  Often they have daily specials that are absurdly inexpensive so be sure to check the sidewalk board. (I.e. $5 sandwich specials for example that are huge)"}
