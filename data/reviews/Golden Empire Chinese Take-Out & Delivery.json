{"text":"If you're looking for tasteless Chinese take- out, look no further. Food is very empty in flavour and substance."}
{"text":"Our usual place was closed so we thought we would try something new. The food was very disappointing. Beef very chewy and chicken had no flavor. Shrimp dish tiny and mainly snow peas with a few teeny shrimps. Noodles very bland. Even the fortune cookies were stale and not edible. We will not order from here again. Noodles to Go down the street is miles better than this place"}
{"text":"Great food - great prices! Loved the dry garlic ribs and saut√©ed broccoli! This is a family favourite!  Always ready on time without error."}
{"text":"We ordered the Cantonese chow mein and sweet and sour chicken. I wouldn't say it's authentic because I've had better  The worst part is that I found a bug in my food. I was super grossed out so I called the restaurant. They wouldn't refund my money but offered a store credit.   I wish I had taken a picture but my initial action was to throw it away.   I won't be going back here and if anyone wants my credit they can have it."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food! Loved the rice especially here and the sweet & sour chicken was amazing! Pretty quick to get your order done and they are very friendly too!"}
{"text":"So underwhelmed with the food here and ridiculously overpriced. Bought siao Mai dim sum plus two wonton soups and was so disappointed. Siao Mai was $8.99+tax for 8 very tiny pieces that weren't that good. I could have gone to OCEANS for better ones and for cheaper. The wonton noodle soup was blah too.  Flavour was almost non-existent. Like drinking water.   I remember ordering from them a long time ago (pad Thai) and having a bad experience with absolutely zero flavour and called to complain in a non-aggressive manner with the owner firing back at me in a very angry tone saying too late I paid for it and I can't return and get refund.  Considering that, I actually gave them another chance (and my money) and tried out again. Officially the worst Chinese place I've ever been to ever. Don't even bother going."}
