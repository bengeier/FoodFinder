{"text":"Ordered the Spicy seafood fried rice and a Chinese fried noodle dish.   Requested less salt and less oil.  They prepared Thai Basil fried rice by mistake but they were apologetic and willing to rectify the error.  We were in a hurry so we just went with it.  Both were pretty good for the price. Flavourful and fresh. It was our first time ordering from here so can't tell if they use less salt and oil than usual, but it was not greasy.  Decent takeout option for a weekday night when you're craving fried rice or noodles. We would order from them again."}
{"text":"Ordered tonight for the first time after getting a menu in the mailbox last week for delivery (just the Thai).  Was pleasantly surprised!!  Fresh, tasty ingredients, good-sized portions, and very reasonable prices.  The mango salad and glass noodles were particularly lovely.  I'm not a big fan of Pad Thai, but it was nice too!  The lady on the phone was very accomodating and willing to make a few changes to what we ordered.  As good, if not better, than other Leslieville Thai places we've tried in the past, and much more reasonably priced.  Will definitely order from again for sure!!  Really enjoyed it :)   P.S.  This is the first time I've ever written a 'review' for anywhere, but felt like they deserved it!"}
{"text":"I order in a LOT, and, after discovering Green Lady about a week ago, have ordered from there 4 times. The food is high quality, consistent, and inexpensive.   I generally order the Thai food from there - Pad Thai along with a Tofu dish. It's been amazing each time and the Pad Thai is easily one of the best in the city. I am particular about my Pad Thai and each time I order, the lady who answers the phone is totally accommodating (much more than I can say for a lot of the other places I've ordered from)  I've done both delivery and take out and both have been great experiences. I've never eaten IN the restaurant, though would like to sometime soon. Basic decor, small kitchen.  Like I said, I do a lot of takeout (at least 5 times a week), and this is the first restaurant I've felt passionately enough about to sign up to Yelp for."}
{"text":"We ordered Chicken with Cashew nuts, Kung Pao Chicken, and Thai Beef Skewers. I found the cashew chicken really soupy and lacking in flavour. The amounts of cashews and chicken did make it worth the price. The kung pao chicken was reasonably spicy. Lots of peanuts, but not a lot of peanut taste. Both dishes had plenty of vegetables that retained their crispness. The beef had good flavour, but the peanut sauce was lacking. Will probably try ordering different items before writing this place off."}
{"text":"I realized that a lot of my recent delivery order reviews were negative, so here's a shout out to a reliable old favorite.   Quality Chinese and Thai, at very affordable prices.    They have recently changed ownership, but the quality of my last order was comparable to the food I used to love ordering when my girlfriend and I were too tired to cook.  People really sleep on Chinese style chicken wings and these ones are a good reason to give them a try.  The new owner raised some of the prices a bit but insists that the quality of the ingredients is the reason."}
{"text":"I use to come here a lot back in the day but I think the owner has changed since then and the price has gone up, portions has gone down, and food quality has gone down. Their chili chicken isn't the best but it satisfies my cravings. Their trays are nearly empty (or empty) after the lunch rush so don't expect any selection in the late afternoon."}
