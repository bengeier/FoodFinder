{"text":"Finally stopped by Meatballz after driving by it so many times.  As we were entering, my son commented that Meatballz is a favorite of a few of the linemen on the Centennial football team.  He recommended the calzone, so that's what I ordered.
My wife got spaghetti and meatballs, and my daughter got ravioli.  The food was delicious. Everyone at the table raved at how good it was. The calzone was not too cheesy and not too saucy.  It was just right.
There was also a friendly guy with an east coast accent that would fit right in on an episode of the Sopranos.  Several people knew him by name, and he checked on how we were doing a couple of times.  Friendly staff and great food at a reasonable price.  5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, great prices.  Unlike most Chandler restaurants where service is terrible, prices are not worthy of the quality of food and service is normally sub par.  This place is great!  If you are looking for high end, go someplace else, this is the laid back, comfortable place to eat something good at a fair price. Meatball sliders!!!"}
{"text":"gee, I wonder why they are all closing.  Not very good, and they close at 7pm!  What?  Yesterday, went there because we had a coupon and they didn't even do the math right.  When I asked if the discount was right, she ignored me and walked away.   We were there right before 7pm, and we literally walked out the door with the workers....they were in such a hurry to leave.  This type of behavior, along with mediocre tasting Italian food, will ultimately do them in."}
{"text":"Walk in, order, self-seat and self- serve.

Ordered Penne with marinara and sausage.
The pasta was kind of on the moderate $ range, 6 bucks ish.
and it was bland. Lacked seasoning and texture.

They were really friendly tho,... its a pity the food was crappy.

I can cook pasta better than them and trust me I am am horrible"}
{"text":"You may be asking yourself, \"Are their meatballs, and meatball parms good?\"   The answer would be, \"Yes, yes they are.\"  Even though the restaurant is named after an orb of succulent meat, and the restaurant excels at that fare, I rarely find myself ordering anything with meatballs when I go here.  The reason being is that their chicken parmigiana is the secret star of the menu.  And unfortunately since Meatballz's chicken parms and meatballs are so good, I haven't explored much else of their menu.  However, I have been told by friends and family who have eaten their pasta and cold-cut sandwiches that those items are very good too."}
{"text":"I live nearby so we thought we'd drop by- big mistake. We called so we could take it home-it began with them being out of a menu item then we had to press them to add a side (which COMES with the meal!). When we arrived, they charged us for an extra entree and they were not very friendly when we pointed this out. The meal was HORRIBLE. The eggplant was soggy, NOTHING like the picture, and VERY SMALL. Not at all worth the price. The brownoli was blah (tasted like it came out of a box). We walked away feeling ripped off- we would never return here."}
{"text":"I dropped in today for lunch, as I have been meaning to do for a while. Before I even tasted the food, I was entirely impressed with the place. While it was busy, the workers still took time to go around and greet many of the customers. I ordered my food to go, and I was surprised how fast they got it out to me.

I ordered the Penne with Meatballz, and it was really great. Though it was a lot to eat, definitely worth the price. Their meatballs are seasoned very well, and would've been great even without the sauce.

Overall, a great place to have lunch. I'll definitely be a regular from here on."}
{"text":"During my trip to Phoenix I consulted Yelp for a restaurant review.

I stumbled upon this place and was very delighted; like a trip to Mama's house.

The owners are super friendly and their food is just wonderful.

The prices cannot be beat.

A++, Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went with my mom, we were really excited to try this new place out.  Nothing was exactly bad, but nothing was very good, either.  Uninspired salad, mediocre meatball sandwich, ok Italian beef sandwich.  The guy at the counter was nice, though.  I will probably not return."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best Italian deli style restaurant on the west side of Phoenix. The food is always good, they use fresh ingredients and it is very clean inside. Bobby is always there to welcome you and to treat you like family. I have been to two of their locations and the food is great at both."}
{"text":"Awesome service and food!  If you like that old world service and food this is the place for you. Italian beef sandwich is fabulous, plenty of meat and great bread.  Menu has been changed recently but the food is still the same, outstanding. Please visit this establishment, it's well worth the price and trip."}
{"text":"I get the Italian beef sandwich with aus jus. This is a serious sandwich and very filling. It doesn't come with chips or slaw or fries. It doesn't need anything on the side. Other than a couple of locally made cheese-steak sandwiches, this is the finest hot sandwich in town in my opinion. 

BONUS: Sometimes, if your'e lucky, they will cook up some fresh zeppoles and walk around the dining room passing them out to each customer."}
{"text":"First time to Meatballz, food was excellent. Hubby and I both had turkey Heroes. Excited to go back to try more entrees. Our waiter, John, was super friendly."}
{"text":"I had been waiting forever to eat here.  I came to this location based on the acclaim the Northsight location received.  I was a bit disappointed.  This isn't a New Jersey-style Italian Deli as much as a franchise in the beginning stages.

I had half a Meatball Hero.  I asked the (very friendly) gal behind the register if I should get a whole or a half sandwich.  She said, \"depends on how hungry you are.\"  I say, get a whole.  Don't bother with the half.  You don't even have to worry about looking like a pig if you get a whole.  Forget about the half, unless you're a child.

The half was small.  It was 5 inches long and not the stuffed full sandwich I was expecting.  What I did have was OK, though.  The roll was outstanding.  The sauce and meatball were acceptable.

I went with two friends.  One got an Eggplant Parm Hero half and the other, Manicotti.  The Eggplant Parm was the same as the Meatball.  It was good but small, again.  My friend who ordered the Manicotti liked it but I didn't taste any myself.

In the end, I left hungry and $7.00 poorer.  For the extra $2 to make my half a whole, my experience would have been a lot better, I think.  Either way though, I don't think I'll be returning to Meatballz.  I'd give it 2 1/2 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Order at the front, and then sit down to wait and wait some more...  though the guy from the Bronx made a point every few minutes to let us know the food is coming and make some small chit chat.

Meatball sliders:  if we go back again, we'd probably get a larger order to share as a main.  They nestle tender meatballs in their garlic knots and serve with a generous bowl of marinara. 

Chicken parm hero:  bland, had to lather the leftover marinara from the sliders to save it.

It's down the street from work, so there is a high chance someone will want to eat there.  I wouldn't mind."}
{"text":"Been a constant customer of their delivery service as I work in the AirPark. The food from Meatballz is as good as it gets. I usually order the Anti-Pasta Salad which has everything you can imagine and then some. Also their sandwiches are to die for. The owner, Mike, is a very friendly Jersey guy who is always friendly and totally on the ball. Good to see that there are business out there that want to see you to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place.

\"Whoz better than you!\" 

The food is not five star but not 0 star either. You pay a reasonable price for good food. The portions are enough to leave you full and you enjoy the place as a whole. 

The owner of this location is friendly and fun. He has this thick accent and  is always willing to make suggestions.  He is a no bones kind of guy and will always tell it like it is.

If your looking for an alternative to fast food and like to whet your appetite on some Italian, it's a great place!"}
{"text":"So we went back and I got the same meal. I just HAD to know if it was good or I was just starving on our last trip. My meal was every bit as good this time as it was last time, score! Now being Sicilian, I know this isn't authentic Italian but they're not trying to be. Hell, they spell their name with a friggin z for crimminy sakes (Sp?) If you're looking for a cool little spot to get some meatballs, a meatball sub or some quick past, this place is it. Sure beats the badooky out of Fazzolis..ickey"}
{"text":"I love Meatballz!  As an Italian from Jersey this is the closest place to home as I can find here in Scottsdale.  I love the place, I go often.  If yo haven't been, you must go for lunch!"}
{"text":"*This is a review of an experience at Meatballz  on 1.8.10 and also my first time there.

I was going out to lunch with a couple of work buddies and meeting up with another friend who suggested we go to Meatballz for lunch. He had been raving about the food for some time and I figured, it's a Friday and I have not yet tried it, so I will give it a shot.  We met at about noon and there was a total of six of us. I was very excited looking over the large menu of various heroes and pastas. 

For those that have never been here, you order at the counter and then the food is brought out to you.  I was the fifth out of six of us to order. 4 people ordered meatball heroes, one person a tuna hero (yes at a place called Meatballz) and I ordered the chicken parm hero and a small drink for $9.12 after the guy at the counter taking the order recommended it over the heroes I was considering. Not the cheapest lunch out there, but for a fresh foot long hero and a drink with free refills it is completely par for the course.  

The six of us were lucky enough to find a table we could all sit at inside . It looks like they may be able to sit about 30 or so folks and there is some seating outside as well.  About 5 to 10 minutes after the last person had ordered, all of the heroes started to come out, except for one. For 5 points can you guess which one? If you said Tuna, you get no points. For those of you that guessed Chicken parm, give yourselves the points. About 30 minutes later and still no sandwich I decided to hit the counter up for an explanation. 

I was told that there was a fresh sandwich coming out of the oven and that it would be out in a moment. By that point I had waited about a half hour, the other five folks I was with had finished or were in the final stretch of finishing their sandwiches so I just asked for my money back.  

Thankfully the guy behind the counter (who is the reason this review has any stars attached to it) was extremely customer service oriented and apologized for the mistake and gave me back my money. Just as I was getting the money back a sandwich did come out from the back but it was too late and I didn't have time to eat nor the desire. I was happy that there was no fuss on returning my cash and let the cashier know that it wasn't his fault that there was a mix up.  

A few moments later the same guy came around the counter and told me he had spoken to his boss and they felt bad. They gave me a 10 dollar gift certificate to come back and try the place again and I appreciate that, but it may be some time before I take them up on the offer. 

There are a ton of places looking for lunch time business and this one is a bit out of the way for me at this point. With restaurants closing in the valley all the time I am sure having unhappy or unsatisfied customers is not something anyone wants. While I do appreciate the attempt at getting me back in, I am going to have to let the bad taste of nothingness leave my mouth first  It is possible at some point I may go back in there, but until that day comes I am going to have to leave this review at a 2 star."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to taste these ballz! (That's what she said!)

Everyone at work has been talking about these amazing balls. I've been waiting to try it out too but the lunch traffic around this area is a total turn off. Bring a gun with you so you can shoot all the idiots in the parking lot.

The place was busy and the menu was pretty much a translation of 101 ways to eat a meatball. Meatball and spaghetti, meatball and penne, meatball and meatball... you get the drift.

I decided to try a classic: the spaghetti and meatball. If you screw this up, I ain't comin' back! Well they didn't! I got my spaghetti quick, even before I had a chance to fill my drink cup. I like that the spaghetti is served in a ceramic bowl and it comes two delicious butter rolls. These were the best part.

The spaghetti was spot on. Tasted homemade and the balls were moist, firm and muy delicioso. Everyone at my lunch table enjoyed their lunch too. The sliders looked awesome and at a great price. 4 meatball sliders for about $5. I had my eye on a couple things so I will definitely be back for more ballz!"}
{"text":"This place has great Italian Beef. Definitely get the Giardiera sauce. The owner running the place is really in top of things and brings an east coast flare. I'll be back for sure!  We got the Brownoli to go (Brownies stuffed with Canoli Cream filling).  AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Great place - Great Service - Great food!  I first found this place in Scottsdale after arriving at my favorite deli across the parking lot and finding it closed.  I drove from my house at 75th ave and Cactus to raintree and Northsight in Scottsdale 3 times that week!  I am glad to see I won't have to do that anymore.  They are a bit pricey outside of their specials but well worth the price for the quality you get!  

P.S. they have a not so healthy salad dressing blue cheese/Italian mix that is so good.  

If you use Sherpa or a I phone app please review its what helps the tourist's steer clear of the crappy places and puts them on the right course to help support our local favorites and keep them open in this poor market!"}
{"text":"Meatballz is to Italian what Carambas is to Mexican. Its not fast food and its not restaurant quality either. Lots of subs, pastas, calzones, etc. Its a mix between Fazolis and a deli. 

I had the sausage hero, and the three meatballz appetizer. The meat balls were little smaller than a raquet ball and came in a bowl with red meat sauce. The sauce was good. It could have used a little heat and a few more spices. Maybe some garlic and basil would have kicked it up a notch. The meatballs were tender. They too could have used a little more spice to contrast the flavors. My hero was huge and the bread was the highlight. They use a fresh soft cibatta type roll. They put it in the oven to crisp it up when you order it. The sausage was decent. It could be better as well with the right seasonings and better quality meat. It was covered in thick gooey mozzarella and meat sauce. I enjoyed it. 

The wife had spinach raviolis and a salad. I tasted the raviolis and wasn't feeling them. Much to bland for me. The salad looked weak. Lots of yellow lettuce that was left behind. 

Everything plus drinks and a tip came out to 30 bucks. Not bad, not great. Would I go back? Sure. Was it amazing? Definitely not. It was good. A-OK."}
{"text":"Meatballz is an excellent lunch place.  I would testify to their food - except I always have the same thing - the Meatball Parm Sandwhich (excellent!) - it's so good I can't bring myself to order anything else.  However, everyone I've been there with seem to thoroughly enjoy their orders.

The only disappointment I've had is when I had a hunger for their Meatball Parm and they were closed!!!  Subway just doesn't come close!!"}
{"text":"After having lunch with a friend at Meatballz and liking the food and service, I decided to go with them for catering our son's one year birthday party. I came in and ordered food with the owner a few days out and he was very nice and easy to work with. I ordered tortellini with Alfredo sauce, cheese ravioli, lasagna and meatballs. Salad and bread comes with orders. When I came to pick it up on Saturday, the manager was also friendly and said that everything just got out of the oven. He helped me bring it to the car and even gave us an extra container of meat sauce. The car smelled like heaven as I drove home. The food was well accepted at the party. People loved the meatballs and I was really loving the lasagna. The salad had chopped tomatoes, onions, olives and cucumbers in it and there was a homemade creamy Italian dressing for it on the side. I highly suggest them for catering a party. Pasta is always a hit and if you have leftovers, they always taste great the next day."}
{"text":"I ordered Eggplant Parmesan and 1 minute after I sat down, it was brought to me.  I knew then that their food was not FRESHLY made!  I pictured it sitting in the back in pans and for how long??  It was cold and It reminded me of Fazollis  (no longer around) - fast food Italian. The owner was very accomodating and returned my money but if you are looking for freshy made stuff,  don't go here."}
{"text":"Before visiting Meatballz, I thought the other negative reviewers were being harsh. They weren't.. I ordered the half meatball sandwich and soup combo. They said they couldn't fill the order because on Sundays they usually use their leftover Saturday bread and they didn't have much extra because it was Halloween and they got slammed earlier in the day and were out. So I said fine, and ordered the penne and chicken 'parmesan' instead. 

It was terrible. The chicken was a fake chicken breast with fake grill marks and was tough when chewing. One bite was more than enough. The parmesan was melted rubbery cheese. And the penne was straight out of the box and the marinara was watery & disgusting. I am not overly sensitive, but I write this now with a very nauseous feeling.

My wife's meatball sliders were straight out of the freezer and into the microwave. NOthing against the cooks, they obviously just get the frozen drivel out of the cooler and nuke it for a minute. Actually, the cooks were the best part of the experience, since they actually had to serve us our food and also the guy waiting for his takeout...because the only girl working was outside talking to the only other customers for 15-20 minutes.....and that's not an exaggeration. Not to mention, two tables of food (one untouched), sat there the entire time without being cleared.

We won't be back, and honestly, I am not sure how this place has lasted so long with food, service and management this poor. Steer clear."}
{"text":"Meatballz has become a daily stop for me lately.  It's the only place around I can get a reasonably priced lunch salad that's fresh and delicious!  The Italian dishes look and smell amazing but I've been sticking to salads lately so that's all I've had, but I'm sure I will try other things eventually.  Their tuna salad is probably one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Just the place for a hearty Italian deli meal when you're really hungry- which I was when I came here after Saturday swim practice. Clean and bright area, fast and friendly service, comfortable and spacious seating. The meatball sub was quite good - rich marinara sauce, tender juicy meatballs, topped with melted cheese. The piping hot pasta fagiole was a tasty starter which was generous enough to be a meal by itself, especially with the tender garlic rolls that come with the soup. I'm eager to try the pastas and other sandwiches in their menu, so this is going to be a favored stop during my future trips to the Camelback Colonnade."}
{"text":"It was okay, I definitely miss it.  The valley needs a few real Italian delis.  This one was close. ish."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  Much better than the average mall location restaurant.  I found my self using the dinner roll to wipe out the last bits of tomato sauce from the bowl of pasta."}
{"text":"Wow!  WOW!  I would have never expected to find this kind of quality here in AZ.  My mother is Italian and I am from Jersey and I won't ever say that these meatballs taste like hers, but damn, they are pretty good.  The bread is awesome as well.  Totally reminds me of being back home.  My friends ordered salads and they cleaned their plates.

I love the owner as well.  He personally thanks everyone for coming in and he shook my hand.  I can't wait to go back and try the eggplant parm."}
{"text":"Good Italian food run by (what looks like) the mob.  If it's not the mob, it's some good fellas, if you know what I mean.  

I can personally vouch for their Chicken Parmesan, and their Sausage rolls.  

Good service.  

And friendly if you don't rat them out to the FBI.  Otherwise, you sleep with the fishes."}
{"text":"I stopped in today after a marathon Last Chance run to check the place out and try a salad. I had seen a picture of their anitpasto salad somewhere before and have been dying to try it. 

Got the full salad, not half and plus a drink the total was just $10 something. When the salad came out- I did a little happy dance in my seat! It was loaded with all kinds of goodies (which is how I prefer my salads to be). There were cheese tortellini's, marinated mushrooms and peppers, artichoke hearts, mozzarella chunks, ham-provolone-salami twists, olives, tomatoes, red onion- omg I'm getting dizzy-----It was incredible! I chose the balsamic dressing (which was marvelous!) but there were several other kinds to choose from. The only thing that I could think of to add to this salad would be boiled egg slices. I saw that they have them on the menu on other salads, so next time I will request them.

For un-salad-y people, they have pasta, sandwiches, calzones and sasuage wraps as well. Those will go over well when I bring my sweetie to Meatballz. Anyway- I am sooo glad I wandered into Meatballz today because I have found my new favorite salad! Supposedly one is set to open in Desert Ridge soon so I will be anxiously awaiting its arrival!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Go see Robert for the best service and awesome meatballs.  Fresh mozzarella tops it all off beautifully!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for Meatballz.  

I visited this location around 2:30-ish and the place was empty. I ordered the sausage sub which was served promptly but at best it was bland. Actually, I thought they had made a mistake and given me a meatball sub.  Italian sausage meat normally has some character, but this tasted more like breadcrumbs.  

If I'm in the area again I might give them another try, but I was pretty underwhelmed by the place and the $7.60 sub. 

Sorry!"}
{"text":"Meatballz is one of those unexpected great finds. A small restaurant tucked off of the main food path and offers delicious fresh italian foods. I definitely recommend coming in and getting some sliders and brownolis!"}
{"text":"I love balls!!! Meat that is!!! So I was excited to try Meatballz. My husband and I went on a Friday night around 7:30 and the place was empty. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs so I would have the opportunity to try their namesake item and what they are supposed to be so famous for. The husband got an Italian sammich of some sort. 
When I got my pasta, I was surprised. The menu said \"spaghetti and meatballs (plural) and in the middle of my pasta sat one little lonely old meatball. There was a lot of pasta, but there was one puny little meatball! WTF? To top it off, the meatball wasn't even very good. Nothing impressive in my book, no flavor, and to be honest, I have had frozen meatballs that were better. The husband was not a fan of his sammich either. The bread was way too crusty and hard and it was pretty small for the price. This place is a total loser and I am almost positive they will go under. They are not welcome in our community!"}
{"text":"I must have looked like a deer in the headlights when I entered Meatballz because they asked if it was my first time in as they gave me a menu. It was my first time at this location. I decided to make a road trip from my office and go over to Desert Ridge to take in the views and the great weather we are having today.

I ordered my usual sausage roll which was delicious. Great customer service as well as they brought out silverware and napkins to me out on the patio. However, I thought $9.84 for a Sausage Roll and a drink for lunch was a little too steep so I knocked off a star. But the patio was perfect and definitely geared for people watching."}
{"text":"I love pasta, but I often find I have trouble paying more than a few bucks for it, especially when I can buy and prepare it myself for a fraction of the price.  That said, I stopped in to Meatballz today for lunch.  Meatballz catered a meeting at the office a few months back and I remember liking what I tried (cheese ravioli, I believe).

The lunch rush was over when we arrived and we were able to walk right up to the counter to order.  The girl taking orders was friendly and greeted us right away but seemed confused when my friend and I insisted on ordering and paying separately, and was especially confused when my friend ordered a 20oz bottle of soda in addition to his fountain drink.  We paid, filled our drinks, and sat down.

The small shop was very clean and pretty comfortable.  The music playing over the loudspeakers wasn't too loud or too soft.  Yay for that!  We waited just a few minutes before our meals were brought out.  My friend ordered the eggplant parm sub and I ordered the penne with two meatballs.  Both portions were huge and piping hot.  I was pleased with the flavor of the sauce and the meatballs.  The pasta was a bit mushier than I enjoy and definitely nowhere close to al dente.  Also included were two small rolls - \"garlic knots\" I believe.  They were not very good at all; the texture was off and there wasn't much flavor, garlic or otherwise.  My friend said he enjoyed his sandwich and would be back to enjoy another.

At $11 and change (including tip), I won't be enjoying Meatballz with any regularity, but when I'm in the mood for a meal that doesn't taste or feel like a fast food meal, I will definitely stop in."}
{"text":"Went to this place about a week ago with a gf and her daughter just to try it out. Did not really get to much because I  was not that hungry but will say this about the place, it was clean the staff was friendly and knowledgeable, and the bits and pieces I did try from picking at my friends food was good. Definitely willing to give it another shot and try out the menu a bit more.

This is more like fast food Italian food than a sit down place. Price was descent and quality was good. Need further review."}
{"text":"Ok, I've been here five times now.
Watchword - Inconsistent.

The first time we were here the place was near empty and the decor wasn't terribly warm and inviting. There was a TV on at the bar AND a radio going at the same time. My wife and I looked at the menu and saw nearly everything was red sauce oriented.

My wife is not a fan of most tomato based sauces so we were headed out the door. The hostess/order taker asked if we had tried their meatballs before, we said no so she brought us a sample.

My wife is hooked. She loves the marinara. She says it doesn't have the same acidic taste she usually gets. I think the marinara is just ok, but this is the first time she's actually *liked* marinara, so we stayed.

The meatball sliders are good. Half a meatball served on a garlic knot with fresh mozzarella (and I mean fresh, as in made in the store).

The caprese salad came out near frozen. The management looked into it and discovered their salad station was set too low and freezing the ingredients. The apologized and comped us some desserts.

The second and third times here were unremarkable for me. Not bad or I'd have remembered.

The fourth time here I had the Italian Beef hot sub. It was fantastic.
The beef was marinated - moist and tender. The bread was just crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, it held up to the au jus well. The fresh mozz over the beef was just perfect.

It was so good we went back the next day and I had the same thing.

How disappointing. The bread was so toasted that is completely went soggy in the face of the au jus. The beef was over marinated or someone made the au jus wrong. Way over the top with garlic and red onion. There were chunks to be found in the sandwich and the dipping jus. 

The caprese salad was very cold, not quite frozen, but a long way from fresh and vibrant. It was served with an oil and balsamic dressing that was seasoned. Too much oil and seasoning. The oil prevented the balsamic from adhering to anything so it puddled in the bowl, and the spices detracted from the simplicity which is a caprese salad.

I'll go back because of the friendly customer service and, because this is a relatively new location, with the hope that these inconsistencies will be worked out."}
{"text":"I have been excited for the Grand Opening... sort of a let down. Good thing I was in a who cares attitude today. 

First a little history... These meat heads started the whole chain and franchised out. They still own Peoria and Phoenix but have either sold or franchised out the rest. 

The place was busy and there were plenty of people working. Most had no idea what they were doing. LOL 

I browsed the menu and decided that the kids meal would suffice for lunch. (Since there are no lunch specials) I ask the order taker if the kids meal come with a meatball, she said YES but then asked if I wanted a drink, which it come with it. I KNEW there was not going to be a meatball. 

The little dude with an earring and Michael Jordan shorts on said to me... Is it for a kid? I said Yes, I am a big kid. He said to no longer order from the kids menu without it being for a child. Then proceeded to tell the order taker never let it happen again. LOL AZZ

The same dude made it a point to serve me the food. It was a perfect lunch size portion of spag with meat sauce NO Meatball and two of the best garlic rolls/knots whatever I have had in a long time.  The sauce was good but it got a little watered down by the pasta not being drained enough. I see quality is not a high point here. 

The other plates looked great and I look forward to trying something else off  the kids menu."}
{"text":"k, my friend had a groupon for this place... First off the guy that took care of us was really friendly and had a cute NY accent.  We ordered the calamari but they didn't have any until dinner... BOO!  But whatever... so we ordered the meatball sliders.  I ordered the eggplant hoagie.  He ordered the cold sub with italian meats, hehe, and mozz and the usual veggies.  I had a side salad and he had the pasta fagioli soup.

Sliders were pretty good, tasty and the sauce was yummy and sweet but not too sweet.  

My hoagie was yummy... I've never seen the eggplant sliced so thinly!  It had a ton of layers of breaded and fried eggplant, sauce ( bit too much for my taste) and a bit of cheese (perfect for me because I hate TONS of gooey cheese, I know I'm weird).  Yummy buy maybe a few too many layers of eggplant.

The cold sub looked very good and my friend liked it very much.

The soup was very simple but very tasty... he let me taste it.  

My salad was fresh and the balsamic was perfect, just the right amount of acid to make my mouth pucker... Love that!

We'll go back for sure.

Don't know what those with bad experiences were going through, but I'm sorry for ya!  Guess we had good luck today!  For once!

{"text":"My family and I ate dinner at Meatballz tonight. The service was fast, the food was tasty,  the portions were very generous, the kids were happy, the owner insisted on making sure we were enjoying ourselves, well fed, and had boxes to take home what we couldn't finish.

It's not a romantic little Italian cafe with candlelight and linens; it doesn't claim to be with a name like Meatballz, but it's a happy little place for an informal family dinner."}
{"text":"I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to Italian.

Went here twice.  Meatball sub one time, pasta the other.  Neither was very good.

Prices are nothing special, either."}
{"text":"This is a great new place. Their red sauce and meatballs are to die for. The staff is also great - they kept the restaurant open extra time after close just to allow me to pickup takeout and then carried it to my car :) WOW! I'll defiantly go back soon. Thanks Meatballz"}
{"text":"Decided to try this new place that opened in April2009.  Glad I did!!  I ordered the meatball parm hero, and holy crap was it good!  I would say it was the best meatball sandwich I've ever had.  Went back for another meal; this time I ordered the italian beef sandwich.  It came with mozarella cheese and some au jus.  Just what I thought....awesome.  On my third trip to Meatballz, I ordered what is called the sausage roll.  This is kind of like a calzone/burrito kind of thing containing sausage, pepperoni, and cheese.  They give you a side of pasta sauce to dip it into.....Yeah, it was great too!  I highly recommend this place.  The service was fantastic.  When I went there with my family, they gave us free brownie canollis.....Make sure you go to Meatballz ASAP for real italian deli food....you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I used to eat at their original location in North Scottsdale and I think this is their newest franchise. The original location is the best since the owners family and friends are in the kitchen and behind the counter. They make almost everything in house including their mozzarella.
I was very excited to try their newest location but I was a little disappointed. The original location is still amazing  and the best!"}
{"text":"If you're in need of a good sandwich definitely treat yourself to this spot. Great selection of both cold and hot subs, that are far more satisfying than a regular Subway sandwich. I have only tried the hot subs, but have seen the cold subs being prepared and they look nothing short of delicious. My favorite is the hot Chicken Parm, but I'm biased towards anything chicken. Last Sunday I tried the house famous meatball sub and it was great!!! Dine in or take out, they even offer free delivery for any order over $20, so long as you are in the delivery area, which I am fortunate to be in. Give Meatballz a visit, they have 4 locations!"}
{"text":"Meatballz is a great Italian restaurant located in a strip mall. There is a limited amount of outdoor seating and not much more once you get inside... The place is small, and gets packed at lunchtime. I'm here to tell you that there is a reason: great food. 

The chicken parmesan is outstanding. The meatball sub is tasty, but a bit heavy. The butternut squash is delicious.

They offer cold cut sandwiches, hot sandwiches (meatball sub, chicken parm sub), pasta dishes, entrees and salads. You can order anything, add a fountain drink and pay less than $10."}
{"text":"I love this place! This was my second visit, and although I want to try other things, I can't help but order the meatball sliders!! Deeee-lish!! The place is clean and the young people that work here are super friendly. I just moved around the corner, and this is one of my new favorites!! Gotta love the Meatballz!!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin....no one was in the places when we arrived. Not that it matters but sometimes it makes me wonder if no one is here is the food really that good? We ordered the food - chicken tortellini, Italian Hero, and kids cheese pizza. After telling the order taker 3 times what we wanted she still rang it up wrong. We proceeded to our table and waited about 5-10 mins for our food well some of it anyway. Pizza & tortellini arrive but not my sub. Everything is premade or frozen food. Nothing fresh! I waited about 10 mins more for my sub then had to remind them. Needless to say we left after a few bites of my \"bread\" sandwich. Probably won't be back here again!!! Oh ya all for $28!"}
{"text":"So glad I can get Meatballz anytime I want now!  The Northsight store's schedule never seemed to mesh with mine.  This one is across the lot from Kohl's, behind the Island Burger and Notorious PIG.  I've already been to the Desert Ridge store twice now and am so glad they're here.  The food's very good, though not quite at the stellar level of the original location yet.  I'm optimistic that even the minor gaps will be filled and then some once they get settled and hit their stride.  If it's your first visit to Meatballz, start with the meatball sandwich and get an extra garlic roll with it."}
{"text":"Go just for the meatball sandwich.  Oh, you'll be trying what your dining partners ordered too, and you'll be back for the other stuff because it is really good.  But those tender meatballs and oh so flavorful marinara will wiggle their way into your brain and emerge every so often as an enormous craving.

No pretense here.  They get you in, get your food and get you sat to eat it with efficiency.  And they do it in a very friendly way.  Looks like they recently did some sprucing up in the place, and did some minor rearranging of the menu to simplify and speed up the ordering process.  Nice job.  

Salads and sandwiches are really good, made with good ingredients like Boar's Head.  Their lasagna is also very good, and most stuff comes with these garlic rolls that are oh so good.  They also offer pizza which I haven't tried yet.

If you have kids, take them here.  From then on you'll have a great carrot to incent them with."}
{"text":"I came here last night for a bite to eat and to see what this place was about.  Overall, it was good, and the guy who waited on me was really super nice.  I ordered thier special, which was half a sandwich, salad and a drink for $7.95. 

Food was good, and service was fine.  I liked it!"}
{"text":"I can dig!  Food here is very good.  I believe everything here is made from scratch the soup to the sauce cause they taste wonderful.  I go for lunch every now and then and I've seen this place slowly pickup business.  It has that deli-sport restaurant feel, but the food brings it home.  I appreciate the usage of real plates instead of paper or styrofoam plates -- very environmental friendly!  I would definitely recommend this place for lunch - 1/2 sand, their pastafagioli soup = Yum! & drink."}
{"text":"went there yesterday for lunch with my son.  first off ... the hostness was rude and not friendly.

we seat outside which was a bad idea, when you're the only one out there, there is tendency to be forgotten about. which we were.

we ordered pizza and wings.  after 20 min she brings the food that right food.  i had to ask for plates, silverware, napkins and remind her about the drinks.  when she came back and only had one plate, i figured forget and we'll make due, didn't want to confuse her anymore than she already was.

the wings were awful, i ate two and hoped i'd have better luck with pizza.  well we didn't.  it was under cooked and tasted homemade (but not homemade in a good way).  a frozen pizza would have tasted better.

she come out with the check and seeing all the food left over she asked if i needed a box and i said no, she asked if everything was ok ...... i was going to complain but just figured forget and and just not go back.

serious, do not try this place, you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I visited Meatballz several weeks ago before a night at the movies. All I can say is that the Calzone crust was obviously made out of Pillsbury's Hot Roll Mix and dry out of the box tortellini is not what I expected for nearly $9 for a small bowl. Never returning."}
{"text":"Could there be a better Italian restaurant for lunch in the valley, no! Meatballz is fantastic. I've had just about everything on their menu and it's all excellent. From the salads to the outstanding pasta you can't go wrong eating here. 

The owner, Robert, is always mingling with the customers making sure everything is to their liking. The service is fast and the food is reasonably priced. I only wish they were open for dinner."}
{"text":"Meatballz used to be so good. The original location on Northsight (now closed) run by Robert that is. Now that they've franchised, not so good any more. Something got lost in the translation from an owner that truly cares to a franchisee.

We wanted a somewhat quick meal before we hit a movie. I have to give them two stars because 1) they had a huge table of about 25 people 2) they just opened. BUT, when the people that looked to be in charge are standing around chatting when they have one table of 25 people it just shows they don't have the customer service skills needed to run a restaurant. When a huge group comes in it should be ALL HANDS ON DECK, not business as usual.

Add to that my meal came out 10 minutes before my partner's (he waited 20 minutes for his) and mine had a piece of plastic wrap in it. Now we know they have a ways to go before all of the kinks are worked out. 

Ultimately the did the right thing and refunded our money, but I didn't get lunch and my partner had to rush his since we ran out of time to get to the movie.

Hopefully they get their act together."}
{"text":"Been a while since i have written a review but I love to get the word out on good places to eat in the valley and Meatballz is a great lunch place. You can get chicken parm with a couple garlic knots and a drink for 10 bucks which is a great deal. The sauce is great, portions big, and the staff is nice. 

The owner is a great guy who talks to everyone in the restaurant and really makes u feel at home. 

If you like fast, inexpensive, good italian then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, and this is good but not great.  I still have trouble with spending more than 10 bucks for lunch, but that is the deal here in my experience.

First visit I had the signature meatball parmesan sandwich, the full size, and I would give that a 4 out of five.  Meatballs were very good - not dried out - and the marinara was very tasty.  Bread was also good if not spectacular (try Z's next door for amazing bread).  However, orders were being mishandled at the tables all around me, and for $10, I expect more than a sandwich and a drink.  No side of pasta or salad.

Second visit I went for the lunch special - half a sandwich and a salad.  Half a sandwich is SMALL!  I felt righteous on departure, but far from full.  Salad was OK, but nothing to write home about.  Seemed like orders were being handled more smoothly, so maybe the shake down cruise was over.

Food is served on interesting square plates which are quite nice.  The dining area is very crowded and it is a squeeze to get to the drink station - it is pour your own here.  Again, for $10, I think I could eat elsewhere and have table service.

Meh."}
{"text":"We tried this place for dinner last night (take out).  It was good, not great - I would eat there again when I needed easy takeout.   I ordered manicotti and thought the meatball that came with it was very good and I think next time I would try a meatball sandwich.   I love it when a restaurant has good rolls or bread to go along with your meal and I didn't care for the rolls (bread was tastless and too much seasoning on top).

Prices were good and portions were reasonable sized instead of all those ridiculously large portions you get at some restaurants."}
{"text":"Went there on a recommendation of a friend.  Ordered meatball and egg plant parm sandwiches.  Meatballs were excellent-sauce rich and full bodied.   Eggplant-sliced a little too thin (personal objection) but was flavorful and cook perfectly.   Good mozzarella cheese to top the sandwiches.   Staff very attentive. 

The place was is in an out of the way location; well worth the trip."}
{"text":"I been waiting for this place to open for 4 months, and I am severely disappointed. The service was terrible, we waited 45 minutes and never got our food, but noticed people who ordered the same thing get theirs(sounds like the order process needs some work)
 
I asked for a refund and the manager didn't apologize and didn't say anything, but to add insult to injury the manager charged us for the drinks!!!!(sounds like the manager needs to learn some customer service 101)
 
On the way out I overheard people talking that they been waiting 15 minutes for 1/2 a sandwich and some people got the wrong order but didn't complain because they been waiting long as well and were just hungry. Please Mind you that this place wasn't that busy.
 
I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"As I write this review, I am steadily falling into a meatball food coma. It has been a few years since I went to their old Scottsdale location and seeing the fantastic photography on the front of their take-out menu was enough to suck me in today. It has been at least a year or so since I have had a meatball sub, but theirs looked SO good! I guess I am sucker for advertising. Truth be told, though, it was very good. There seemed an endless supply of meatballs in my 10 inch sub (I gave my 3 year old a quarter of it, so I am not a total pig!). Cue in the juvenile snickers from my husband when I told him I ate about 7 inches of the sub. The sub was a little too saucy for me, but not enough to prevent me from ordering it again. I am sooo looking forward to trying this location's stuffed pasta and hope it is as good as when I used to go!"}
{"text":"I have never eaten inside Meatballz, but I have ordered take-out twice.  OMG!  So delicious!  I order the hot eggplant parmesan hero!  As a vegetarian, I am always delighted to find meat substitutes or alternatives on a menu.  Eggplant is available as the \"meat\" of several entrees!  The hot hero is amazing!  The marinara sauce is delicious, not acidic.  The melted cheese is a nice touch and just the right amount.  The eggplant is sooo good!  I highly recommend ordering the eggplant parmesan if you're a fan of eggplant.  ;)  My coworkers and I are hooked on this place and order take-out from Meatballz often.  The prices are AWESOME too!  For a vegetarian, this places deserves an A+ for Chandler mall vicinity.  Simply awesome!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch places, and they've recently improved!  

The wife and I stopped by here today for lunch and I was impressed with a new menu.  They're offering pizza now and for the first time I noticed that you can get an Italian Sausage Parm Hero.  

That's what I got and it was SO good!  

The same guys run the place, but they've ramped up their friendly service to an even higher plateau.  One of the owners was greeting every group of customers as they came in and the staff was doing a great job finding tables, etc for the huge lunch crowd that was coming in.

This is bare bones, fantastic Italian lunch food.  Not a place to go on a date, but a place to get an extremely satisfying lunch during your busy day.

I highly recommend stopping by, eating lunch and saying hello to the boys!"}
{"text":"Located on Greenway at 75th Ave. on the west side of road.  This is a strip mall that has experiencing failures lately - Garlic Jim's pizza failed, the massage place failed, and the hair salon failed.  Maybe Meatballz will turn things around.

Meatballz offers a casual dining area very similar to the location in Scottsdale, with the same menu, and in fact I think there's substantially more seating at this location because of the back room.

If you don't go with the lunch special you could be looking at a pricey lunch.  My cheese ravioli with small soda was $13, and this is a pay at the counter sort of place.  Warning to health conscious and vegetarians - the \"tomato sauce\" is really a meat sauce.

Food is above average if you're grading it on a fast food scale, but falls behind if you're grading it on a casual dining scale (Bravi has a similar setup, with a nicer atmosphere, and arguably better food).

Plenty of parking... which I love."}
{"text":"Very casual atmosphere and feel, but the food quality and portions are quite good.  I did the egglplant parmesan with linguini, and it was up there with any of the other local or chain versions of the same entree. 

Most items are around $8-10, and it is a very casual atmosphere, but you're getting very good food for that price whether you dine there or take it home.

Manager or owner seemed to be there this evening and it was amusing to see his inspection and approving words for my finishing the entire plate of pasta.

For an unpretentious pasta place, that is rather \"fast\" with their food, this is a good place to visit."}
{"text":"I have to agree that the meatballs and sauce are very good. The rest...

I had a meatball and pepperoni calzone which was good, but had less cheese (especially ricotta) than I expected and had the doughiest crust I've ever had in a calzone. Really needs more of a crispy crust to give it the right texture.

My girlfriend had the meatball and pepperoni pizza which she said was OK, but didn't seem to have the right kind of cheese on it. It appeared to have both mozzerella and ricotta. She's not a big fan of ricotta, so it was a bit of a turn off for her.

Good and quick service and a nice clean place. We'll be back to try other dishes, especially the meatball hero."}
{"text":"Meatballz is tucked away inside a typical North Scottsdale strip mall. I wouldn't really call this a restaurant - it's set up more like a lunch deli. You wait in line to place an order, you pour your own drink into styrofoam cups using the self-serve fountain, you find whatever seat you can, and wait for your food. 

Now, the way this place works is like many places who are adopting this trend where you place your order and take a number to your table and someone brings your food to you when it's ready. It means you don't have waiters really, but you also don't have to stand around waiting to pick up your order... If you want to tip, they have a tip jar.

The seating is very cheap and ugly, but it's comfortable and you're not really here for the ambience. You come here for good food at a decent price with no signifigant hassle. It's your lunch spot if you work in the area. There's really no reason to make a special trip here, but if you're checking out car dealerships or doing some shopping or on a lunch break - it's a solid choice.

They do catering - even on short notice. A lot of businesses in the area do take-out here. They have pizzas, pastas, sandwiches, and the standard fare. We ordered a pizza, a sandwich and a pasta dish. They have great meatballs and stuffed pasta. The pizza looked delicious, but we're saving it for dinner. Their sandwich bread is a little \"artisan\" for my taste (artisan translates to dry and stale as far as I'm concerned), but they use quality meats and cheeses. 

The staff is friendly, the place is clean, and the food is solid and reliable. You can't really go wrong. I still prefer DeFalco's by a mile, but if I ever end up in this area, I might go again."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go to Meatballzzzzz for quite some time.  You have to say it that way, with a really long, over-enunciated z at the end.  We go to the Pick Up Stix next door quite often, and the name of the place next door just made me giggle!

Finally we went and grabbed some takeout one night.  I ordered what I figured would be their specialty, you know spaghetti with meatballzzzzzzz.  It came with a few garlic knots as well.  I ate the garlic knots in the car, and they were actually really good.  Well, some of them were.  The ones that for some reason or another were missing the garlic were just blah.  The spaghetti itself was cooked surprisingly perfect al dente.  The sauce wasn't anything special and was a bit watery, perhaps because they stuck the spaghetti in before it drained all the way.  The meatballzzzzzz i actually liked a lot.  They were tender and meaty and had a good flavor to them.

Next time I am feeling like cheap \"Italian\" food, like pasta with white sauce since the husband won't make it for me, I think I might give this place another shot."}
