{"text":"This place has been around for decades. And Coraopolis is full of Italians from the homeland. However, I don't know any of them that eat here regularly.  After the place was featured in Diners, Dives & Drive Ins, I figured what the heck, I'll give it a try. I won't make that same mistake again. The sauce was oily (as was shown in the episode) and bland and noodles were tasteless. Home made? Maybe. But not the way I do it. It wasn't the worst Italian I've ever had, buy definitely not up to Pittsburgh Italian standards.  How anyone could rate this 4 or 5 stars is beyond me."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! I saw mixed reviews of if they were open or closed. I called interested in the lasagna. The person who answered said yes they were still open unlike what people had posted here on yelp but now I know why. I live in the area and walked down with my sister. Upon arriving we noticed a cash only sign...... okay fine lights on... signs said they SHOULD be open till 8:30 so we walked around the block to get cash. We come back and all the lights are off.  Open sign now off and closed! I mean seriously...... it's not even 6:30. The person who answered said they were open till 7... signs said till 8:30. I am very disappointed. I wouldn't waste my time again. Left a bad taste in my mouth that is not lasagna."}
{"text":"I am so torn in writing this review. I was really hoping to love this place. It's very close to my house, it looks like a classic joint (it totally reminds me of Louis' Restaurant in The Godfather on the outside), menu is simple and on and on...  Lobello's was featured on Guy \"Fieri'\"s show on Food Network a few years ago (don't call me \"Ferry\") where the meat ravioli was raved about. I was about to order that with a side of spicy sausage as my entree when our waitress told me about the special - Rigatoni Lobello. Rigatoni Lobello is rigatoni with spicy sausage and hot peppers. I was sold. My wife went with the meat ravioli.  This place is old school. Our food came with bread and little dinner salads in tiny chilled bowls. Adorable, I thought, we're off to a good start. My entree came out first, about 5 minutes ahead of my wife's.  The Rigatoni Lobello was amazing. Rigatoni cooked a perfect al dente, the hot peppers and sausage all wonderful together. No complaints about my dish - well, except for the price tag ... $16.95.  I was not expecting that.  Now, on to the meat ravioli. This was such a huge bummer. The sauce was bland, the ravioli dough was thick, doughy, bland and overcooked. The meat filling was a tiny meatball and just a bit bland as well. The redeeming part of this dish was dipping it into the spicy sauce from my entree.  Total damage was $37 with the tip. This was just an expensive outing considering that only one of us really enjoyed our dinner entrees.  Unfortunately, I don't have much cause to return unless I know in advance that they are serving Rigatoni Lobello. Our waitress tells us that the specials are when the chef feels like it and that she hasn't seen Rigatoni Lobello for sale in a very long time."}
{"text":"We were excited to visit this place after seeing an episode on Diners, Drivers, and Dives. Unfortunately, they were out of the homemade ravioli but I had the lasagna. The lasagna's noodles were not overcooked and tender. The sauce was ok. Personally, I like more spices in the sauce but I guess this is typical Yinzer sauce. The meatball didn't have that much flavor as well. The pasta fagioli was ok. My husband said this place reminded him of his grandma's cooking but his sauce and pasta fagioli is better. The waitstaff was very nice."}
{"text":"FAMOUS FOR: - Ravioli (5/10)  I ALSO TRIED - Meatball (6/10) - Side Salad (4/10)  I'm shocked! This has to be the lowest number of reviews I've ever seen for a Diners Drive-Ins and Dives joint! I mean, wow! The Ravioli Youtube video has been up for 5 years, and there are only 10 reviews?! Well, YouTube has done well in blocking out content, so the only thing that's still up there is a 2-3 minute video on their Ravioli. Something tells me that the segment went on longer, but I'll never know.   As I was heading toward the rental car return, I found out my flight was delayed for an extra hour. I'd been poring over the map and determining whether or not I can make a detour, and I got my answer. It was about 17 minutes from the airport. I walked in around 5pm or so on a Friday, and it was completely empty. It's a little early for dinner, so I guess that's the reason. It's a tiny place (as most DDD places are). There're about 8 booths and then a long table in the middle for about 16 maybe?   It's a dive. There isn't any ambient noise except for someone's radio playing country music in the kitchen. Apparently everyone likes it, because everyone kinda hums or sings along with it (I hate country music). Why country is playing in an Italian joint...who knows. Everything's cheap. The spoon looked like it's seen a few wars! Even my receipt at the end was a torn off piece (neatly at least) of notebook paper! CASH ONLY!  SIDE SALAD I don't recall seeing that the ravioli comes with a salad - but I got one anyway. It looked like freshly torn off pieces of lettuce, a few slices of tomato, and you couldn't see that there was any dressing on there, but there was. It tasted like Italian but more of a vinaigrette. 4 seconds were spent on presentation. They threw lettuce on a plate, but then put a few slices of tomato on top and 4 rings of onion on top of that. Lettuce felt pretty fresh. The tomato was just functional - didn't really have any flavor. The dressing was ok - maybe a little bit too vinegary. It was a pretty barebones salad.  RAVIOLI It looks exactly like it did in the youtube. The pasta dough itself is pretty thick. At times, I had bites that almost felt downright doughy. If you cut one in half and see the meat, you'll be astounded at how small it is! It's about the size of a piece of sausage on a Dominos sausage pizza - in other words, tiny! A small comes with 6 raviolis, and a large comes with 7.  The meet inside tastes, well, \"ground beefy.\" I'm not really a ravioli expert by any means, but it was hard to glean any other flavors. I watched the video, so I know what's supposed to be in there, but there wasn't any real personality to the beef. So flavor-wise, not much going on. It was seasoned well, though. Strange as it may sound, because it had a solid beef flavor to it, it may have made a decent burger patty (I could be totally wrong about that). Put it this way, I really wouldn't mind having a spaghetti with these at meatballs.  The consistency of the sauce is pretty standard for ravioli. It's thin enough where you can scoop some and pour it on the ravioli, without really sticking to the spoon. It is NOT a marinara sauce, by any means. If there's basil in there, it's very very subdued. It's very tomato sauce-y. As in, I'm sure they added other things, but they didn't deviate that much from the tomato base.  All in all, not bad. I ordered it because it was featured, but it's not something I'm planning to have again.  MEATBALL I ordered 1 meatball to accompany my ravioli. So, they put the meatball in the center of my ravioli plate, also swimming in the sauce. This one's easy. Remember the ravioli meat - just expand it now, to the size of a golf ball - maybe just a tad smaller. The meat is the same - very beefy. I was now able to taste a little more of what goes in it, but not by much. It's still very much ground beef flavored, but now there's a slight hint that there are other flavors in play (i.e. onion powder, garlic powder, parsley). I don't know that because I tasted them, I know that because I watched the video. Again, it's not bad, it's just nothing special.   So, I've had meatballs from other Italian places, and usually they're gigantic - like tennis ball sized. They also have much more fragrant flavors, specifically oregano, which sort of gives it a whole new face. Oregano is a strong flavor, and for me, I'd prefer to notice an \"essence\" instead of having something \"tastes like\" it. This meatball doesn't have any oregano, and since I do like the taste of well seasoned ground beef, this meatball is just all right with me.   But no, I'm not going out of my way to come here. Again, This meatball will probably do well in a spaghetti.  LOW BELLOWS Ever since Pizza Palace in Knoxville, I have a new optimism for simple spaghetti (just noodles & meatsauce). Though I didn't have spaghetti here, I had all the ingredients. It may be worth a shot if I'm right in the area - but I'm not going out of the WayToComeBack."}
{"text":"Stopped by this adorable little establishment driving through Corapolis on a business trip and thought I'd stop by after reading reviews online.  Let me preface this by saying that Rose, the owner, is one of the sweetest ladies I've ever met and she tries to come say hi to all who eat there.  She started working here as a young girl and is now the owner - and has some great stories to share - including cooking even while she was recovering from brain surgery \"they can't keep me away!\" she says.  She's the Italian grandmother you always wanted.    Along the walls are newspaper articles written about her, local celebrities who have visited and even a poster from the Food Network show, Diner's, Drive-Ins and Dives who recently featured Lo Bello's.  With that said, I ordered a combo gnocchi, spaghetti and ravioli plate and even though i could tell that everything was made with love (everything from pure ingredients and made from scratch), it wasn't the type of Italian that I'd prefer.  Definitely very much home-cooking, but I would have liked more flavor in the sauce, which was the same for the 3 items.  For $18, portion was a bit small and only came with 1 meatball and 2 raviolis, and the gnocchi was long rather than pillowy.  Getting to meet Rose was a real treat though, and I would come back, but maybe try something different.  Don't forget to sign her journal before you leave - she keeps them all!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here since year one !   I especially like their Broasted Chicken alog with their spaghetti and meatballs!"}
{"text":"Nice little joint!.... The salad dressing here is honestly amazing and worth the trip in itself.... If you're looking for the new hip place thats going to give you fancy plates and fancy layouts then this is not your place , but if you want solid good Italian food than this is a nice place"}
{"text":"The food here was very good and  tasty. The noodles were fantastic. As was the red sauce (they use the same for all dishes, so despite the lack of variety it still is very good), the alfredo sauce, and Italian dressing.   I also had a cup of the pasta fagioli, which was really good, but there was so many noodles stuffed into the cup, there wasn't much room for the broth.   We were there later in the day, and the owner wasn't present. It would have been nice to meet her.   The restaurant is very casual. The soda comes in cans and the dish ware is plastic. So don't go expecting anything high class."}
{"text":"Fantastic. By far one of the most awesome dining experiences I have had in my life. First off, the food is superb, but it's not just the the food that makes Lobello's a must while in the Pittsburgh area. The proprietor of this fine establishment, Rose Lobello, really adds to the experience by speaking with each guest and making them all feel like one of \"her people.\"   The food has an especially wonderful taste as it definitely is made with a touch of love. Rose really put an entire lifetime into this restaurant and it really shows. Our spirits were really low when we visited Lobello's because we'd spent about an hour in mind-numbing traffic after a horrific University of Pittsburgh loss to the Cincinnati Bearcats. The meal at Lobello's really picked up our spirits by filling our hearts and stomachs with love!   The ravioli, lasagna, and meatballs are all superb. The prices are so low that it is worth getting multiple entrees and sharing them so you can get a taste of the many wonderfully delectable dishes on the menu.   Please patronize this establishment if you are in the Pittsburgh area because you would be missing out on a wonderful experience if you don't!"}
{"text":"I forgot what night it was but the Pens were playing in the Stanley Cup finals and there was nothing near my hotel to eat. So i take my adventure with my GPS and decide to go hunting for my food. I was driving for 20 minutes finding nothing on the street i was on and got tired so i turned onto a street that was one way. Boom! There was a few restaurants on the one way street..sweet! I decided to pick Lobello's next to this pizza place and another restaurant. Not bad, as i walk in..i see this picture of the guy in the show Diners, Drive In and Dives..Guy Fieri. Woot. This place seems good. Well, i ordered my spaghetti and soup togo and head back to the hotel. Back to the hotel as i watch the Pens and i open my food. Nice setup and OK packaging of the food. But they forgot the spoon! Noo..so the whole time i was eating my soup with a fork. That's a new. Soup and fork. The spaghetti was good but i cant say excellent but i wouldn't mind to go back when I'm in the area. It taste like home cooking to me."}
{"text":"The wooden booths are so cool.  Must be originals from 1944 when this place opened.  Love the old neon lights in the windows!  Cool spaghetti house!  LSH sells the seasoning for salad dressing and I would think they sell alot of it.  It is so good with some very nice spices that made an average salad very good.  Salad was just head lettuce with some tomato slices and onion slices but the dressing made it.  The lasagna is good and the red sauce is very tasty and was not oily (per another review).  There was homemade coconut cream and chocolate cream pies but there was no room!  Next time!"}
{"text":"My first trip to Pittsburgh, I stayed in Coraopolis and wanted some spaghetti and the GPS pulled this place up but they were closed that day, but a cute little place.   A month or so later my wife and I saw them on Food Network's: Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. I was compelled to stop in next time.   I was greeted by the cutest old lady who sat and talked with me while I ate some awesome homemade raviolis. She told me about growing up in the neighborhood, her medical woos, and showed me all the sign in books from thousands of people. All with wonderful things to say.   But to the food, I can't help but order the ravioli everytime I come in these days because it's so good. Sauce is quite good, and is tasty on the bread.   Stop in on your next visit, you won't be disappointed."}
