{"text":"Horrible service, the guys rushed us out when the restaurant was empty. Poor selection of wine, the pasta was more then al Dente, the lamb was full of fat, no meat. Pricing was over the top, 2 meals no appetizers and 1 bottle was over $500"}
{"text":"Good old Italian place, with traditional decor and ambience. Went there for a business lunch on a weekday. The goat cheese and beer salad was a yummy appetizer - nice portions. The main was a tomato sauce with shrimp but that was only average. Was happy to see that I could substitute spelt for regular pasta. Price wise, it's pretty expensive. All in all, an average lunch experience."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a very relaxed gastronomic experience at Tremonti. The food is spectacular and they know what to charge for it, more the kind of restaurant I'd expect to find in downtown than at the end of a plaza up north. Ambience is touch and go depending on the clientele in a given sitting as the place doesn't have much of its own. Warm wood finishes would suggest a more mature audience but loud groups were abundant at last visit. Service is timed beautifully and alternates between incredibly pleasant and perfunctory. We both had a fish special, cooked in a delightful tomato broth and well worth going off menu for. As hinted to by another reviewer, the wine list is neither extensive or inexpensive, however refraining from choosing a cellar bottle would keep the cost down measureably and there is definitely adequate selection for most. Dinner for two with shared appetizer and dessert, wine, tax, and tip came to ~$150."}
