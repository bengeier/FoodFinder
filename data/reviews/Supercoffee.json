{"text":"Best thing to open up in the Mount Dennis community. Great, friendly staff and the menu is fantastic. This coffee shop is highly recommended to anyone looking for a nice and peaceful atmosphere."}
{"text":"The coffee here makes my gf and I feel super in the morning. It's a great addition to the neighbourhood and I think we've been needing a shop just like this. I do wish they had a loyalty program but a local coffee shop still makes it all worth it. I've also spilt my americano over once on a very windy day and Cassandra gladly replaced it. I'm here literally every morning unless I'm running late and the gf has to pick me up from home for a glass of water and some coffee. The barista there is also lovely and I see her going out in the cold to open the door for a gentleman in a wheelchair all the time. Your kindness has not gone unnoticed. There are also tonnes of community events and postings up in the shop which is great for the community I.e. Open mic night, skating at mount Dennis. I would also love to see extended hours..sometimes we're out doing work late and have to go to the second cup at Stockyards or Starbucks on St. Clair instead. Thanks for being here Supercoffee!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! The coffee tastes inexplicably better here. The staff are genuine and friendly. The decor is great. Perfect cafe."}
{"text":"Always order the caramel latte and its always great!"}
{"text":"It wasn't THAT HORRIBLE  that probably the only \"nice thing\" I can say. Service was subpar, payed 10$ for a panini that came with American cheese and cheap ham. The place isn't very good to hang out and study. I won't be coming back any time soon. My advice is if you have a better place to go, go there. It's small, despite what other reviews saw about ample seating."}
{"text":"Good coffee and flaky croissants. I enjoyed the salvage/retro chic and the art was interesting."}
{"text":"Finally something decent in the ghetto. I don't have to drag myself all the way to St Clair to have a decent espresso. They have a good selection of baked goods. But go early to get the best selection. Obvs. The staff are nice. And the price is great for what your getting. The caramel brûlée late is good."}
{"text":"Very nice place to sit and chat.  I like a lot of their menu items including their ham and cheese panini. I've also heard some very good things about their chocolate chip banana bread as well! I also like the fact that they offer you stirring spoons that you can dispense in a water cup for re-use. That's something I haven't seen in ages in a cafe such as this!  Despite being in a sketchy area, I can easily see myself coming back here. The tea was lovely!"}
{"text":"I discovered this cafe from the internet and was surprised on how close it is to my school. My friend and I went there for the first time about 2 weeks ago and have been going back mostly everyday. The staff is really nice, the things they offer are fantastic (especially the lattes) and the interior is so cute. Best of all, it's not too expensive either!"}
{"text":"The only place it is possible to work at 6 days a week and not want to kill yourself."}
{"text":"I didn't expect to find a spot as nice as this on a dark winter night when I came here back in December. While I visited quite close to closing time, the quirky lampshades here provided a cozy ambience in an area quite north of the core. Really stands out in an area that isn't the most exciting, especially at night.  Had a French vanilla (not a sweets guy and this one was very well balanced) and sampled an excellent espresso. Blueberry muffin, again, strayed away from too sweet and I enjoyed it very much. Will be back for lunch if I'm ever in the area"}
{"text":"Supercoffee has been a fantastic addition to the neighborhood and it's beginning to pave the way for other places to open up in Mount Dennis.   It's nicely renovated, highlighting the old Mt. Dennis charm, the coffee is fantastic, the barista is cute and friendly (love the tats & hair) and they offer more than just coffee (which seems to be the norm with all these other hipster cafes). Maybe it's a Toronto thing, but cafés in Europe sell more than espresso and biscotti. Point being: I'm glad I can get a savory panini here lol  Thanks for investing in the community!"}
{"text":"We ordered mango Smoothie and frozen latte; go with a large salad of wild rice butternut squash and Tuscan bean. The sale was great and drink was good too."}
{"text":"Very happy with this super coffee, and it is super affordable! They offer baked goods from Circle + Square and their own homemade chocolate banana bread which is a must try. We buy espresso beans for our home machine too."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my visits and stays here.  It's absolutely an hidden gem in this part of town.  Their coffee is great and very hot which is a must for me.  Also had their Americano, iced coffee and latte which were all impressively good.  I'm not a sweets person but did manage to give their muffins a try and was pleasantly surprised by how savoury good they were, not too sweet and baked to perfection. Not favourite has got to be their banana pecan muffin.   The bonus is the cozy atmosphere and cozy is lovely and yields a chat over coffee and tea anytime you are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"It looks like the kind of cafe that people stumble upon in movies. Super friendly staff, amazing overall ambiance and interesting art pieces hung everywhere. The food is great and they will even bring it to your seat. In love."}
{"text":"I liked their toppings on coffee they provide: coaca, suger crystals, cinnamon.. So good. I got white hot chocolate with those toppings."}
{"text":"Neighborhood coffee shop that's not a chain or in downtown (Score)  Their baked treats are really delicious. Salted Dark Chocolate cookie is a favorite and I love watching them bake em fresh when I go in. They make a nice sugar and gluten free energy bar with dates and other delicious things. The prices are good on everything including their grilled veggie and havarti panini sandwiches. I haven't tried the other variations but I definitely find myself craving the veggie once in a while. For $6 it's a catch!  The servers are friendly and efficient. The seating space is good and there's normally a jug of lime water on the counter for guests.   Although I don't drink coffee I love the smell of it and my co-worker loves their coffee and croissants in the morning.   Too bad there's no parking near-by so it's mostly foot traffic. It's a shining beacon in the weston/eglinton neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Good vibes, good coffee, good food.  This is what Starbucks would be like if it was simplified and if the pastries were homemade."}
{"text":"Was in the area and craving good coffee. I judge coffee shops by how good they make americanos and I can safely say their americano is on point, it had the perfect rustic flavour. My server was friendly and I would gladly come back here for a coffee if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing varieties of coffees teas & cool drinks. Not bad prices way better then any big chain coffee stops. Great staff & is wheelchair Accessible"}
{"text":"Great promise to see this kind of addition to the Weston neighbourhood. For many you would never bother with the trek, combo of poor transit (improving soon!) and bit dismal around here... Supercoffee does have great coffee and good staff. Nice interior."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great vibes. This great little indie coffee shop is a great hidden gem in Mount Dennis. They have awesome and inventive ways to get customers involved such as having you put a penny for the mayoral candidate you're voting for. They have a lot of natural light which I like as well. A bit pricey but worth supporting a great local business like this one!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, the place is nicely decorated and the staff is friendly.  The  location is somewhat odd, perhaps not the most gentrified location, the parking is somewhat difficult if you don't get one of the two dedicated parking spots.  It would be nice if they had some music playing."}
{"text":"I work nearby and I've gotten a double cappuccino every day since supercoffee opened. Awesome every time."}
{"text":"I passed this place numerous times on my way home but never paid a visit until yesterday. I think this place is a nice addition to the neighbourhood even though it does seem a little out of place.   -Nice, bright interior -friendly staff -reasonable prices (but don't expect tim horton's prices though) -great coffee: I've tried the cappuccino, Americano and Iced coffee (TIP: get the iced coffee lightly sweetened, you can always ask them to add more later) -delicious baked goods: banana bread and the chocolate chip cookie were super tasty. Will try more soon!   This place turned out to be a great find. Don't let the odd location prevent you from trying out this place!"}
{"text":"A rustic coffee shop on the corner of Eglinton and Weston Rd. Very cool paintings on the walls that you can buy.   The staff is cool, plenty of seating, and its a great alternative to the chain coffee shops nearby.  The coffee is decent and is a mixture of blends from different regions."}
{"text":"Supercoffee is my new coffee stop.   My partner and I just moved to the area and we decided to take a walk this Sunday morning and find some coffee. Supercoffee was the closest coffee shop to us so we decided to head there first. Now, I checked reviews and photos online before we went and I concluded that there probably wasn't going to be anything there that I could have (vegan) but my partner convinced us to go anyways so off we went!  We arrived there around 8:10 am and there was already a couple of people inside having coffee and baked goods. My partner ordered a macchiato and a almond croissant. While I was waiting in line with him, I saw some vegan treats! SCORE! They had 2 types of vegan cookies on the counter as well as a vegan chocolate, peanut butter and oat bar that I quickly snatched up to try. I didn't end up ordering any coffee but on my way out, I saw that Supercoffee does indeed have soy milk! I'm so excited to go back and get an ice coffee. Along with prices being cheaper than Starbucks and them actually have vegan food I can eat, this place already has my heart and I'm sure it will also soon take over as reigning queen in my caffeinated soul."}
{"text":"English and Portuguese  Small cafeteria that always save my life and my lazy mornings. The place is a bit small but is really nice, clean and organized. Particularly, I love the message that they write everyday one different and leave outside, so cute and creative.  They have some and good options to drink or to eat. My favourite drink is the Caramel Latte, but the sweets is so good too. The service is fast and they are kind. Thanks guys!  ---- Portuguese Uma pequena cafeteria que sempre salva minha vida e minhas preguiçosas manhãs. O lugar é um pouco pequeno, mas é bem legal, limpo e organizado. Particularmente, eu amo as mensagens que eles escrevem em uma placa, todo dia é uma diferente que fica na frente da loja, são sempre frases fofas e criativas. Eles têm algumas boas opções pra beber ou comer. Minha bebida favorita é o Caramel Latte, mas os doces são muito bons também! O serviço é rápido e eles são sempre educados. Obrigada galera!"}
{"text":"A really chill cafe in the Weston/Eglinton area.  What's particularly nice about this place is that half of the coffee shop consists of windows, so you can literally watch the world go by...  Contrary to some of the places in the area, Supercoffee is not rundown in the least.  Looks like a relatively reno'd joint.  Prices are good.  An Americano was $2 and it was nice and smooth.  Large White Chocolate Macadamia Shortbread cookie was $1.50.  Apparently there is 2 parking spots, west on Eglinton, so if you're coming from the west and are lucky enough, you can score a spot.  Otherwise, it's street parking on Weston road - which the male barista (owner?) said is usually not a problem!  Would def stop by again if I was in the area!  Highly recommended.  Too bad it's not closer."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this cafe !!! It's very near my home and I would give the Americanos 10/10 !! By far the most delicious Americano I have tried ! I always find espresso to be a little on the strong side depending, every cafe is different.. But these however are never too pungent yet full of flavour and very aromatic ! The cafe itself is very cozy right on the corner of Weston and Eglinton. The staff are very friendly folks as well. Be sure to ask for a coffee punch card too ! :)"}
{"text":"This a great addition to the neighbourhood! The coffee is great, and fresh! This is my new place for a cappuccino that is in budget and made with love."}
{"text":"Love this place! What a great little gem for this neighbourhood. It's a cozy atmosphere with a quiet setting. Their coffees and hot chocolates are flavourful! Along with their brownies, banana bread and red velvet cupcakes.. Yummyyy!   Only thing, I wish they had more options for breakfast. No one wants to have sweets for breakfast (well, at least me aha). Other than that.. It's a great coffee shop!"}
{"text":"This cafe is similar to a Mom & Pop version of Starbucks except furniture isn't as nice and the floor's uneven. The wooden and steel chairs were wobbly because of the uneven floor, so you wouldn't want to sit for hours with your laptop or your friends. But no complaints at all about the drinks, the food or the service which is cheerful and prompt. Hubby had a latte, I had a London Fog tea and we shared a nice cheese panini with fresh tomato and pesto. If you are in Mount Dennis at Weston & Eglinton, drop in here and get takeout if you have more comfortable seating nearby. Parking is at Green P 651 across the street, $1.00 each 1/2 hour or $4.00 all day to 6 pm."}
{"text":"Very new place, but you should give it a try. I've been here four times in the last two weeks, and have not been disappointed. Good coffee, yummy pastries and baked goods (they have supersonic cookies-yes!) and the owner is very very friendly! I know this coffee shop seems to be in the wrong place, but I think it's making a cozy little home in the community. Give it a shot :)"}
{"text":"A much needed small neighbourhood coffee shop. I stopped by on Sunday morning and it was quiet with about 15 seats inside. I opted for the mocha and was not disappointed, I did have to add a bit of sugar as it isn't very sweet. My boyfriend got a black coffee with no complaints as well. The prices are what you would expect for what it is, not notably cheaper or pricier. I have yet to try their baked goods but I'll be back for them!"}
{"text":"A totally unlikely location for a fine and friendly cafe. The coffee based drinks are on par with the best on Queen West, and the staff seem to have been teleported from there as well ! Which in this case is a very good thing. There are 2 parking spots on the west side of the cute building, so please do not drive by with doors locked as most of us do when in Mt Dennis. Supercoffee is a true beacon of culture, behaviour, cleanliness and decor in a rugged neighbourhood. Cash or debit only."}
{"text":"A quaint little quiet cafe right on the corner of Weston Road and Eglinton Ave. West. I've been here a few times and every time I go the employees are super kind and sweet. All their stuff is made fresh, and the iced coffee is great!   It's a cute little space to sit in and read a book, or to just drop by and grab coffee while you are on the go. I also LOVE the messages they write on their outdoor chalk board sign, they're so cute and I look forward to reading them everyday when I walk by :)  I wish it was open a little later though as it does close around 7pm."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful quiet cafe. Plenty of room to sit and many wonderful drink/food options. Been there three times already and have always been satisfied. I love this gem in the neighborhood. I highly recommend this cafe to anyone and everyone.  It's worth visiting!"}
