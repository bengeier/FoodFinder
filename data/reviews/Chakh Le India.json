{"text":"Great food!  My go-to truck for Indian food.  I recommend their chicken Korma and butter chicken to anyone who makes a visit to soldier's memorial"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. Tasty, spicy, quick, inexpensive. Friendly guy in the truck. I've seen him encourage cashless patrons to simply pay him back next time.   Food is cheap. For about $6 I get a small chicken vindaloo with a samosa and Coke. I like spicy, but I ask for a 4 out of 10 so it doesn't take me two hours to endure the meal. Really hot.   He takes calls ahead time and writes nothing down. He says that if he forgets your order, its free.   Wish it had a better appearance, but at least you get the sense that it's the chaotic order of one man, as opposed to a lazy rotating crew."}
{"text":"Awesome food. The best place to go for Indian food in Pittsburgh. Food is prepared fresh unlike other carts. The USP lies in the fact that it is not priced as high as it should have been for a food so awesome as this.   You can get a small dish(Biryani-Chicken/Mutton or any starters or main course ) for $4.5 and large for $5.5. You can have 2 course of meal during the day given the quantity that is provided. You can customize your spice level from 1-10. Go for real Andhra spice if you like.   Last but not the least, don't visit because of cheap food, or spicy level, go for the awesome experience!!!!"}
{"text":"So, I just wrote a review on the Thai food truck that sits right beside this one on Bigelow. The Indian truck is actually quite popular and people I know absolutely love the food. I think that as food truck quality goes, the food is good. While it's great that the owner (who is very nice) cooks the food in front of you, it does tend to take a while to get your food - and this is particularly rough when the weather is not so good! Since my first few visits, I've actually have their number programed into my phone so I can call ahead - which I highly recommend. In regards to the food, I typically get curried veggies and rice. The curry is great, veggies are just ok. They ask how spicy you want your dish from 1 to 10, and their spiciness tends to be a little higher than typical - so adjust your desired level of spiciness accordingly. And the dishes are cheap too, I believe a small dish is $4.50, medium $5.00, and large $5.50 (paired with a soda if you want for $.50). Overall, good food that takes a bit more time than next door, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite place to get lunch near Pitt.  Large portions, great prices (5.50 for a large, 4.50 for a small), friendly service, and the food is always brightly flavored and, if you want it, legitimately spicy. The taste is completely different from the tepid Indian food one often finds. I couldn't recommend it more for a quick lunch on campus.  You can call ahead if you want to avoid the lunch rush, but I've found that even when  busy the wait still isn't that long."}
{"text":"Let's get this straight. The food is quite good here, not the best I've had, but quite good. Lamb Vindaloo was what I ordered. The gentleman is also very nice. I would come back BUT I have the curse of white-man stomach. Maybe you should order it less spicy than I did. But I never seem to learn. (Probably means I'll stop by next week - see you there - damn you, intestines!)"}
{"text":"Delicious  and cheap indian food. Uncle makes amazing mutter paneer. Free soda if you are a regular customer. :)"}
{"text":"Best Indian food cart in Oakland. The owner is friendly, and makes all the food when you order it. I've had many of the options, and have enjoyed all of them. The prices are hard to beat, and the quality is consistent.  The samosas, chicken tikka masala, and lamb dishes are fantastic   Cons: Cash only Wait time (can take up to 10 minutes)"}
{"text":"I always wanted to Chakh up with Chaka Khan. I think that time has come and gone.  I think the chance for this place to be as good as the truck next door has come and gone too. The meat in the Chicken Tikka Masala wasn't bad, and the menu is identical to India On Wheels next door (which it's clearly copying, right down to the prices and awful Mango Lassi), but that's where the similarities end. IOW is the best curry in the country, whereas Chakh is pretty bland and average. A couple of hygiene issues which put me off, as well. Still, I wish them luck in their business. But you need to go to India On Wheels."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I ever had. As a college student in Oakland this was my favorite place to get lunch between classes. It's quick, cheap, and delicious. I have stood outside in rain, sun, and winter cold and snow for this food with great pleasure. The owner is very friendly. He remembered my favorite order and is a very generous and hard working educated individual. I hope this truck stays open for many years to come."}
{"text":"OK, my credentials: sure, I'm a white guy. But I've traveled to India. I have had two serious relationships with Indians (one of them having been born there; one of them having been born here), totaling over a decade of exposure to authentic Indian food. I was taught to cook Indian food by an Indian who learned how to cook in India by his own Indian mother. So, I'm not just some random person.  DIsclaimer: Indian food varies widely across the country. I personally am more aware of the north/south divide, and I can recognize some trends in the western part of the country as well, i.e., West Bengal. And OF COURSE--all of that being said--it's very possible that some of my tastes are somewhat Americanized . . .  So . . . I kind of hated this food truck. I have gone there three times, and there are still some items that I would like to try, and maybe the cook doesn't screw everything up?  Visit #1) I ordered the \"Palak Paneer\". This should be cheese cubes in a spinach cream gravy. First of all, I was slightly annoyed that he didn't have any parathas. These are flatbreads essentially cooked on a skillet, made with flour and water, and (I don't remember) possibly some form of fat. I can go into my kitchen right now and make some in five minutes. They're not exactly labor intensive, but I do prefer them often to naan, as they can be less greasy and less \"processed\". Anyway, I order my food and get back to my work . . . and it's not palak paneer. Instead of paneer, it was potatoes: aloo. Do you know how disappointing it is to expected delicious savory cheese cubes and you get potatoes instead? Don't get me wrong--my father is Irish--and I love potatoes, but they're very boring when you expect something else. Also, the base gravy was not made in any way that I am familiar. It was reddish and oily. I don't even know if it was spinach. \"Palak\" means \"spinach,\" while \"saag\" is the word for nondescript greens, but this seemed more like some kind of \"saag\" or perhaps \"methi\" (fenugreek). It wasn't creamy at all.  Visit #2) This time I was very clear to enunciate the \"PALAK\" in \"palak paneer.\" And that's what I got . . . except again it was in the reddish, oily, non-creamy base. Maybe this is a regional distinction, but every time I've ever ordered/made palak paneer, I put a milk-product in with the pureed cooked spinach to get a yellow-green sauce, never red and never oily. And it also seems to me that it didn't really have the taste of spinach. I could be wrong and the spice blend--which was not that I am accustomed to--was masking the flavor.  Visit #3) I saw \"Gobhi Manchurian\" on the menu, and this made me excited. I don't often see it on Indian restaurant menu! Do you know how \"Chinese food\" here is heavily Americanized and nothing like what you would get in China? Similarly \"Gobhi Manchurian\" is the Indianized version of Chinese food: heavy on the deep-fried stuff and MSG. Pure delight! I had really amazing Gobhi Manchurian in a mall in Delhi. You take the cauliflower, bread it in chickpea flour (besan) and deep-fry it. Then you cook it in a thickened soy sauce base. (My ex would use ketchup to get the tanginess perfect!) But this that I got from the food truck? It crushed my memories of good Indian food with a beloved ex. The cauliflower was not breaded, not deep-fried, there were all these other vegetables in there in excess--onion and bell pepper/capsicum--and the sauce was very thin with not enough MSG at all. It made me very sad.  So! Will I go back? Probably twice more, at least. I *really* want to try the Chili Paneer, because I used to buy this frozen brand that tasted like culinary crack cocaine, and it burned your mouth as you writhe in ecstasy. Also, I suspect that the food truck doesn't mess up \"tourist favorites\" like \"chicken tikka masala\" and \"butter chicken/makhani murgh.\" (I will give any person cash money who can tell me what the difference it, other than \"Chicken Tikka Masala\" is more British. A *significant* difference. And then point out to me that Indian restaurants in America actually follow through in this difference.)  But the ONLY reason that I'm even going to try these other things is because the truck is ludicrously cheap. Otherwise, only a one star, and I'm done with it forever. If I want Indian food that I am certain I will enjoy, I will go to \"Prince of India,\" an actually restaurant a few blocks away on Fifth Avenue.  I should also mention that the food truck guy is not very friendly or social at all. From what I understand, such food service-related work can be considered somewhat demeaning, and I think it makes people hardened. I'm just old enough that it irritates me when the cashiers at McDonald's don't even pretend not to look bored with my existence, so maybe it's just me. But the food truck guy is a bit gruff. I wish it were otherwise. I'd be please as punch to get to know him a little better, just to hear his story, and maybe see if we could have a chat in Hindi."}
{"text":"Given that I walk past the food trucks on Bigelow twice a day on my way to and from work, I've been meaning to try them for awhile.  When I met a friend who's leaving town permanently for lunch on Tues., I suggested that we check them out, since they're convenient to both of our offices.  So, we picked up lunch there and headed over to the area in front of Soldiers and Sailors Museum, which has a green and several tables, to eat lunch and chat.  Having heard good things about the Indian trucks, and seeing that they were comparable in prices and ratings, I decided to check out this one, which is the white one closer to O'Hara St. I ordered the paneer makhni ($4.50), which appeared to be one of their specialties, as well as a mango lassi ($1.50).  Because I had dinner plans, I opted for the small size, which was actually quite substantial, esp. given the price.  Because my friend was running late and I didn't know exactly what I wanted, I didn't call ahead to order.  My order took about 10 min. to make, which, although not super quick, didn't seem too bad, and I'm willing to give leeway since the food is MTO, as others have mentioned.  Note that there were only one or two other orders ahead of mine, so I'd recommend calling ahead when class is in session.  Aside from its size, the first thing I noticed about this dish was how messy it is--I'd definitely recommend asking for extra napkins.  The next thing I noticed was how bright red the sauce was, with no discernible cream.  Given the name, I expected the sauce to be creamy, like the sauce that comes with chicken makhni.  Even palak and saag paneer have been served with creamy sauces whenever I've had them.  When I dug in, it became obvious that was a high ratio of diced onions and peppers to paneer cubes--I believe there were about 6-7 cubes in a small serving.  While the description of the dish did say that it included onions and peppers, I expected them to play a relatively minor role in the dish, given that this has been the case with other paneer dishes I've had.  Finally, the dish was quite a bit spicier than I expected, to the point that my nose ran while eating it, so I'd recommend ordering on the low side of the scale if you have limited spice tolerance (I ordered my food with a spice level of 4/10).  I'm glad I ordered the mango lassi, since it helped to cut the spice, but it wasn't as cold or as creamy as I'd have liked.  While this food truck is definitely inexpensive and provides large portion sizes, I don't know that I'll rush back, given that there are a couple of very good Indian restaurants nearby.  If I were to return, I think I'd order a different dish--perhaps one of the meat-based ones--in hopes that it didn't have as many vegetable fillers."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this little Indian truck near Soldier and Sailors.  Yes, it looks somewhat suspect, but the Allegheny County Health Department blessed it with a green sticker of approval, so you're good to go!  You can get a decent sized curry dish and rice (or two pieces of naan, if you ask) for $4.50!  Seriously can't beat that with a stick.  I love the daal, which changes daily, and the chana saag.  This truck is VERY veggie friendly.   I usually come here once per week, more than that if they weather's nice.  Definitely give it a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"There are lots of options for Indian food in Pittsburgh, particularly Oakland, and this cart is by far my favorite.  As a college student, the existence of this food cart was a lifesaver. The portions are very generous, especially considering the low price (I recommend getting a large...makes two meals for me, one VERY filling meal if you're one of those people with a raging appetite)  The owner of this food cart makes his own curry blends from scratch. Therefore, the flavor isn't always consistent day to day when getting the same kind of curry, but ALWAYS delicious!  If you love spicy food, another positive aspect of this cart is that the food is legitimately spicy! No ordering a level 10 and getting something with barely detectable heat. Of course, mild is also an option, as each meal is cooked to order.  There are various meat and vegetarian options, appetizers, and drinks. The wait is usually short, I'd say 10-15 min, but can be somewhat longer during peak lunch hours if the line is long. It's worth the wait to get a freshly cooked meal though.  Fresh, hot, cheap, flavorful food in copious amounts...what more can you ask for?!"}
{"text":"I had the Lamb Vindaloo spiced at a level of 7.5 on a scale of 1-10. I was warned that 10 was very spicy and that most Americans could not handle it. In retrospect, I felt the dish was not spicy enough for me  and that a 10 may have been underwhelming as well.   The flavor of the dish was okay. It was balanced, and I couldn't pick up on any of the other spices. The lamb itself was a little tough. I would have liked for it to have been softer and for it to have fallen apart easier. There also wasn't enough sauce to cover all of the rice, so I had a few bland bites of basmati.  As a final note, I think the portion size and quality are fair for the price."}
{"text":"Great food sometimes comes from not-so-great-looking places. This truck is a prime example. I got a large vegetarian curry at mild/medium spice. The flavor was well balanced followed by a solid wave of heat at the end. It definitely included enough for two meals, but make sure you have cash!"}
{"text":"So this is the first Indian place where my palak paneer was orange and not green and my roti was a wheat tortilla cooked on a stone. But it is a big portion for 5.50."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Oakland: Vinay grinds & mixes his own spices & can customize to your heat preferences since he cooks everything fresh while you wait (not true of other trucks). He even grows his own chili peppers. The flavors are fantastic - just like in India - and Vinay is very generous in many ways. Just a great place to get enough very tasty food for a couple meals - bring cash & an appetite."}
{"text":"Really amazing Indian food truck.. Been here for many years and used to be called Kashmiri.. When I came back to visit Pittsburgh, this was my first stop. Spice level 10 is desi-spicy!"}
{"text":"This is actually my favorite spot for Indian food in all of Pittsburgh; it is delicious, but also very affordable. Of course, you have to find your own spot to eat, but that's not too difficult no matter what the weather is like. The spice level is legit--a medium is fairly spicy, particularly if it's been a while since you've had real Indian food."}
