{"text":"I came here today, the desert was pretty good, and the place is really big, loved the tea!! Durian rolls tasty really good! Very fresh. And the service is good too, they always smile!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would. I've been here not a few times, and every visit was disappointing. Not only is the food quality and service not good, they were also busted for serving an endangered species of turtle. I'm Chinese and generally have no problems with the various foods that we eat, but an endangered species is a big NO. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Service and food were terrible. We reported a dish was foul tasting and they ignored us and said too bad. Will not return to a place with that attitude."}
{"text":"Has good \"Siu Mei\" dumpling, very good \"Bean Curd Skin Roll with Pork in Oyster Sauce\". Stay clear of the Deep Fried Squid Fingers as it's super breaded to hide the fact it's old freezer burnt & not good at all. What a waste & pity it ruined our brunch."}
{"text":"So I've seen this restaurant change a few times, never really been in here though, so I tried it, never coming back.

So first we sit down, atmosphere is simple and very plain. It was very spacious and plenty of tables everywhere which is good. Service... is debatable.

1. We didn't ask for hot tea, but we got some and assumed it was complimentary but charged us on our bill.
2. Every time we ordered something, nobody could understand us even as we're pointing at the actual picture so there was literally 3 servers trying to decipher our orders. After a while believe it or not, we had to use Google Translate to communicate to them.
3. They don't have most of their dim sum on their menu. I had to ask what they had available instead because most of what I wanted they did not provide.
4. They did not provide us with steamed rice. We asked for some but they just laughed at us. Like was that supposed to be funny? So the server gave us a cup of steamed rice when there was three of us. (There's charge per bowl of rice) It was totally fine, I just assumed it would be a bigger bowl/plate of rice like the other restaurants in Chinatown serve when it's family style.
5. We ordered pecking duck from the dim sum menu, and they decided to cook us the whole duck. When we told them that the order was wrong she said \"It's okay if you don't finish it, eat it for dinner tonight\".......... what? So we got charged for the whole duck. The duck didn't even have flavor and they didn't give us the sauce that comes with it. 
6. The pork chops had sugar on it. Different style maybe? The fried soft shell crabs in the picture had three in it, but they only serve two. The server said the photographer took the pictures of the food in different angles that's why it looks more. But in reality, it's smaller, so next time she said not to believe the pictures..... what?
7. Once we received the fried soft shell crabs they already gone bad. Was not fresh at all, in fact sour. They did make us a new batch of them without charge but we already lost our appetite to eat them.
8. I don't know why but the servers kept laughing at us every time we wanted to order something or ask for water. And it wasn't the friendly laugh. 

For the three of us it came out to $50, and we were still hungry when we left. And I left wanting to throw up too so yay even better. 

I understand that they're new and that there was is a bit of a language barrier. But I'm really hoping that they improve on their service and food a bit more because I want to see a permanent restaurant for that location! Personally I would not come back but if it improves I totally would."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place to go for Chinese food. The food is delicious and cheap. 
Convenient location, easy to find."}
{"text":"excellent service from the younger girl waitress.  The rest of the staffs were just alright.  
Dim sum decent.  Even though its a cart pushing type of dim sum restaurant but it's more like made to order.  No complain there, nice and hot.  Ordered a lunch special dish, tasty.  So, I assume their dinner dishes should be very okay."}
{"text":"Had really good seafood here. Unfortunately, I hate to see my kids crawling on their greasy carpet floor."}
{"text":"The food was not terrible but the service was! I'm very disappointed because this place is in my neighborhood and I really wanted to love it. From the start, the server wasn't very welcoming but thought I'd keep a patient, open mind. We ordered a wor wonton soup and 3 other dishes. After we ordered, a very large party arrived and were served immediately. They were served their soup, rice, and dishes, all before us over the span of at least 15 minutes. The server did notice that we were wondering what was happening. She brought us a couple of items to appease us. When I did express my opinion that it might be a good idea for the kitchen to at least send our soup, she said that that other party had called ahead. She didn't need to give an excuse in a matter-of-fact tone, instead she should've just assured us that our meal was coming asap. At the end of the meal I pointed out that instead of orange chicken, she had brought us lemon chicken, as stated on our check. Instead of being apologetic she took a defensive tone and explained that they always cook their orange peel chicken with lemon flavored sauce and with lemon slices...hmm...  Bottom line, her demeanor throughout our time there conveyed that she didn't care whether or not we came back and so I won't. :("}
{"text":"We tried this place as it was so close to home. We went here for lunch for dim sum and was not disappointed. It's same as other places around and not crowded at all like the one at the Goldcoast."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located inside the strip plaza across fdom the Yee Hong residence.  Not surprisingly, a lot of their lunch clientele are seniors and their visiting family members. Dimsum dishes are priced very well at $2.50 each all day.  Portion sizes are good and arrive at your table piping hot.  Taste is only average though."}
{"text":"horrible service. no one speaks English, had go ask kitchen for every item we ask to order. half menu was not available. server had no item what they have or don't have. there was 5 different people had to get involved for taking orders. charging random items on check by name \"special order\". 
really don't recommend this restaurant if you don't speaks Chinese."}
{"text":"A New dim sum place near my house so we decided to give it a try...flavor is similar to all the other places in town, Nothing stand out but the dessert is not bad. I ordered the almond tea bund with lotus seed in it, light not too sweet but if you are durian lover, must try their durian rolls. Overall, food is ok ."}
{"text":"I usually come with family for late night dinner. 

Pros: the seafood, the maggi sauce lobster is really good, eel rice that needs to be ordered in advance usually, golden pumpkin and bitter melon, smoke duck breast and they have live shrimp if you want to try something a bit different. 

Cons: Service is not so good, helps if the waiters and waitresses know you. Some of the more popular foods run out. 

Overall I like this place, seafood is at a reasonable price and prepared well."}
{"text":"All the foods we were order was delicious. I would like to recommend to everyone in state and other people that just come to visit in Las Vegas. Good place to come"}
{"text":"This is your typical fast paced Chinese restaurant. Its definitely not one of the fancier places. More like a small chinese restaurant. Food is alright. Wok style food. I love wok food, the aroma and fragrance it gives off is different from your typical family style Chinese food.

Nothing special, typical wok food. Ambiance.. Typical loud small Chinese restaurant. Food is good :). Service is typically fast. Food comes out pretty fast. Service isn't the best.. Don't be expecting great service. Its like everyone is constantly in a rush frantically doing things. 

Not a must try. We usually go when our choices are limited and I want wok food in the area."}
{"text":"Food was superb. Service excellent. Very accommodating. Price was very reasonable. For only being open less than six months you NEED to visit this fine establishment"}
{"text":"Yeaaaaah... this place.. no thanks. 
I only came here with my family for dimsum because I had an appointment nearby and my parents love dimsum. This place needs a lot of improvement.

From our multiple orders, not one dish was outstanding. Some were very mediocre, and unfortunately, some were terrible. Particularly, I'd like to point out that the beef brisket noodle dish that we ordered was starting to go bad. There was an off-flavour to it that was slightly sour and that really turned me off for the rest of the meal."}
{"text":"Good food, garbage service and lack of everything else.

This coming from an Asian knowing how bad Asian service already is and this is worst."}
{"text":"All gifts from the heart are not created equal...and Fortune Seafood Restaurant's fell a little flat (gratuitous reference for the 0.89% of the world that speaks Cantonese).

There are certainly better options in Vegas for Dim Sum. The real crime is that the worst items we received were seafood items...your name has the word seafood in it...make sure it's fresh! 

We came in on a Saturday around 11:30am to find a relatively empty dining room with only a few other tables occupied. We had a sense that it wasn't going to be that great, but you can only judge 95% of books by their covers...plus we felt obligated to stay and write a review since there weren't a lot of reviews to go off in the first place. The service was great!...fast and attentive.  We ordered many of our favorites and few other items:
Har Gow (Shrimp Dumplings)
Siu Mai (Pork Siu Mai)
Pai Gwut (Pork Ribs)
Nor Mai Gai (Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf with some mysterious substance)
Hom Sui Gok (Glutinous Rice Dumplings w/ mushroom & pork)
Daan Taat (Egg Tart)
Liu Sha Bao (Salted Egg Yolk Custard Buns)
Steamed Scallop Dish 
Almond tea bund with lotus seed

We generally eat all that we order, or at the very least take the left-overs home. There were two dishes that were bad enough that we didn't want to finish them: Har Gow (Shrimp Dumplings) & the Steamed Scallop Dish. The seafood was certainly not fresh, spoiling the dishes. 

The simple choice is to find a different restaurant. If you do find yourself here, without the options of leaving, you would do best to stick to the Pai Gwut (Pork Ribs) and Hom Sui Gok (Glutinous Rice Dumplings w/ mushroom & pork). Still there was nothing good enough to recommend outright and certainly nothing to bring us back."}
{"text":"Apparently this place is fairly new but I was surprised to see only one other party seated when we arrived. I'd read some reviews on this place (duh) and a lot of reviews had one thing in common: the silverware/dishware were dirty. So, as expected, the tea cups was beyond disgusting and I immediately requested new ones.

The language barrier between the waitress and us was so bad that she had to go get one of her colleagues to translate. That is perfectly fine - I am all for that; it makes the place feel more authentic - but maybe put someone on the floor that knows even the tiniest bit of English or at least enough that she can take an order :)

The food was good but not exceptional. My favorite was the beef with bean paste and that was pretty much the only dish that left an impression. We also tried the sweet and sour soup, which was too bland for my taste. The pork buns were good but a bit too chewy, almost as if they were undercooked.

This place is so close to home that I'm actually a bit sad that it isn't better. I don't think I'll be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Worst customer service!!!, food aren't even that great. Orchid's Garden Dimsum is wayyy better. This was our first time coming to this place, it will be our last time. Not worth your time and money"}
{"text":"First and last time coming here for dim sum..

This restaurant is just recently open, located on Decatur across from International Market. 

I posted pics of the dishes I order, most of them are NOT good...

The price is average, like all the dim sum I've eaten.. Sorry Ping Pang Pong, located inside Goldcoast casino... Is by far the best dim sum in vegas.."}
{"text":"Checked in here for the free dim sum... definitely not worth it. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. Their dim sum is usually pretty good. Their dinner is usually not so good. The restaurant is pretty cramped too.

Came for dinner tonight. Sun was coming through their side door very strongly. The glare was almost directly on grandpa. We asked them if they could do something about it, and were bluntly told there was nothing they could do. With a little effort, they could have gotten tape or something and taped newspaper up. It would have been better than nothing. Further on in the night, we asked if they had a particular dish (that we had ordered on a separate occasion) only to be told that they had never had this dish before. We checked with a different server, who not only confirmed that they had that dish on the menu, but that he could put in our order for it. 

Had:

Corn and fish maw soup - pretty good. Decent amount of fish maw too.

Peking duck - 2 ways. 1) Peking duck wrap. 2) lettuce wrap. Peking duck crepes were quite thick. The duck skin was cut unevenly (some pieces being huge and some piece being slivers) and was the leanest I've seen in quite a while (or ever...) resulting in some very dry wraps. The cucumber looked like it'd been pre-cut (starting to shrivel) and the hoisin sauce tasted a tad off (almost like they had mixed in a bit of the fermented bean curd one puts on their lamb hot pot). Peking duck is usually a dish that clears pretty quickly (cuz everyone likes to eat it). Tonight was a good indicator of the quality of the duck. My mom and I both had a minimum of four pieces each because no one else was eating it. I ended up eating it because I did not want it to go to waste.

Stir fried snow pea shoots with garlic - fresh. Good portion.

Sweet and Sour pork - not a very big portion. Not a great ratio of meat to filler veggie. Needed a lot more meat.

Free run chicken - color was good. Texture was decent. No taste though.

Salty fish, chicken cube, tofu in hot pot - a tad too salty for everyone's tastes.

Broccoli with egg white and crab - not so much crab as shrimp. Very strong seafood smell (and not in a good way). Egg white was cooked decently. So was the broccoli. 

Complimentary sweet soup: red bean. Nothing to say because I'm not a fan of red bean sweet soup, so it would have been wasted calories.

My suggestion: come for dim sum. Don't do dinner."}
{"text":"I've come here many times for dinner as its very close to my house and they have decent food. I am friends with the staff there and I enjoy their food selection. I ordered the Yin and Yan Fried Rice Dish with the sweet and sour sauces and it was flavorful and tastes better with the rice fried as the waiter suggested. I also ordered the pork chop dish with salad dressing sauce which is quite good and one of my favorites here. When we came here for dinner, they had a scallop special for about $3 each so we ordered it and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Beer is relatively cheap here at $3-$4 for a bottle of domestic beer. In terms of price, it is cheaper than many of the other Chinese restaurants for the same great food. 
They also do hotpot here. The restaurant is relatively clean and the staff are friendly here. Service is good and the ambience is the same as other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Honestly the food isnt bad, but I can see why people are giving this place such low ratings. The service or the lack of, has a lot to do with this. 

Food I would give 3.5 star. Service I would give 1-2 star. Monday to friday dim sum special is $2.50 all day. But before 11 am there is no tea service charge. And I believe there is free newspaper as well. We ordered a few things. The steamed spare rib with plain cheung fun was quite good. Spare rib was very flavourful and cheung fun was really soft. The stickt rice roll was also nice. The pan fried chive pancake was the best. Super crispy and big. The har gou was my least favourite. The shrimps were really fresh and flavourful but the skin, omg it was thick. Like so thick. They also came around with some fresh pastries and we got the lotus root with century egg pastry for $3.20. Very nice, very soft, and very worth it for $3.20. Tea was hot. Dishes were surprisingly clean despite the price. 

This place is very very small. We came early at 8:45 am so there were plenty of tables. But after 9:30 the place was getting busy. The servers were very emotionless. Kinda just put all the dim sum down and said bye felicia. Never saw them again, so no one picked up our plates and it was hard to get anything from them including the bill. But for $2.50 I kinda didnt care. So my advice is when they put your dim sum down tell the server what you need at the moment so you dont have to flag them down later.

I wanna say this is a nice friendly neighbourhood dim sum restuarant, it is minus the friendly part. They serve traditional dim sum and it is quite fresh. 
I will probably come back but never on weekends or past 9:30 am."}
{"text":"Been here so many times for lunch since they open. Love love love their dim sum. The lovely ladies boss, BB and our hostess Jenny make us keep comming back! Will be back try their dinner soon, keep u all post!!"}
{"text":"We were drawn to the restaurant as it was one of few in the area open at 9:30om and it appeared to be new from the outside. 

Once inside we were immediately disappointed at its appearance but decided to give it a try anyway.  The waiter, an older man perhaps in his 60s,  was downright miserable. He took our order and was reluctant  to offer any information about any of the choices. He did not even ask if we wanted drinks. When the food arrived it was mediocre at best. Rarely do we leave food behind, but the food was such that we did not want to be reminded of this bad experience again.   The utensils and plates were not very clean and when asking for more rice, it is doubtful the same  man who was cleaning up even washed his hands before he went in the kitchen for the rice. 
We felt rushed to get out, but seriously wanted to spend not a minute more than necessary there anyway."}
{"text":"Very very good. The salt n pepper shrimp and calamari were tasty and had a mild sweetness. Yang chow fried rice was good. Was surprised at portion size for the shrimp and calamari. Bigger than the ruce. Nice to see Chinese customers of all ages. Can fit really large groups and serve dim sum in mornings with the carts.  A group of about 100+were having a party, and St. Room for more. Will be back."}
{"text":"I don't know if they just opened and was short on staff but I hate to say that the service was not very good... The hostess walked us to our table and did not ask us if we wanted any beverages. We did not have utensils or condiments. There wasn't much of an option on the dim sum. Only two carts did one round and it wasn't as fresh.. We did not have device for awhile after that. The chowmein we ordered for the kids tasted bland. This place needs better service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on Decatur across from the International Market. They have dim sum all day and you can order from the menu. 

We ordered pork shumai and custard bun, they were very moist and delicious, one of the best I have had. We also ordered chicken feet and roast duck. Roast duck was different texture and the way it was prepared, the skin was very crispy and there was no fat on the duck. It was amazingly good. We also ordered 3 other dim sum dishes but apparently the waiter has forgotten to put in those order. The waiter did not come back to ask if everything was good. we waited for 20 mins and I had to walk to the cashier and had to cancel the order since the server forgot.The service was not good. I would give it 3 stars but the food was delicious so I am giving it 4 stars.

The price is average compared to other dim sum places."}
{"text":"Food is edible. Restroom is really dirty. Didn't surprise me though. Dishware  are dirty also."}
{"text":"The service here was horrible. 2 carts only bringing out the same old crap. Will never go to this dump again. To make things worst dumb lady asks if i know what dimsum is and that theres no regular menu. I sit down and 2 carts of garbage going around and people ordering off the regular menu. Dont waste your money at this dump. I think the owner was the cashier she got mad at our waitress at least but screw this place. Im sticking to Orchids Garden for my Dimsum cravings"}
{"text":"this place has very good dim sum.  it's a small place, frequented by seniors that live across the parking lot.  booking a table for dim sum is pointless.  come and wait in line or share a table.  the dim sum they serve is worth the wait.  the dim sum is very cheap but this does not mean that cheap is bad.  this place is a hidden gem.  wait till lunch is over and there will be plenty of tables.  the pork siu mai is very good.  not greasy and plump.  dragon's feet is good too.  they do dinner too but i have never done dinner at this place.  washrooms are downstairs.  this may be an inconvenience to the elderly.  service is ok."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely terrible. Place was almost empty so I'm not sure how they missed that up. Had to ask multiple times for multiple things and they justin ignored. Literally grab plates from other empty tables right in front of them because we were short on ours."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food. The dishes are tasty and flavourful, I would say tastes close to as if I were eating in Hong Kong.

2 stars for cleanliness and customer service. They are hard working staff but they have very little space to work with and are not mindful of rushing dishes, hot clay pots, buckets of dirty water around people.  There are lots of menu options taped on the wall written in chinese only. The staff are not fluent in english. The washroom is pretty gross lol, avoid if possible lol.

Their specialty dishes to try:
Deep fried pumpkin - the inside is sweet and soft, outside is a crispy salted batter. If you like squash or pumpkin, try this!

Eel fried rice - tastes fishy so don't try if you don't like seafood. This is cooked and served in a clay pot. 

Fried soft shell crab"}
{"text":"A new Cantonese restaurant just opened a month ago, I went in at 11, got some dim sum, gotta say it was turned out better than rio and ping pang pong. The durian rolls were pretty good, crispy and fresh. So I got one more dish, cream custard buns are really really tasty. Just one bite then yellow creamy juice just came out! And red bean jelly cakes are way better than the ones I had in England. Anyway, I love it, and I'll go there and get durian rolls and red bean jelly again! But but but you will not expect to see anything back in the kitchen. Got it? :)"}
{"text":"Dislike this restaurant...I went here for dim sum and left with a stomach ache. I suspect the food is not clean and would not recommend this place to anyone."}

{"text":"Good!! Service is great!?will come here next time!  Good sweet tofu and baked pianapple custard bun."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The waiter didn't come by for more than 15 minutes. When she finally did come over, she stayed for all of 20 seconds while we tried to order and then walked away when we tried to ask questions. It was like she couldn't be bothered. We left without eating"}
{"text":"Place is located across the chinese senior home; inside the strip mall and is very small. 

Food was okay. $2.20 for dimsum on mon-fri and tea is .50 per person. Just average though. 

Service is reaaally bad even for a chinese joint. LOL WTF asked one server to cut our beefballs and she gave us the biggest cut eye and came back with a knife. Dad was so pissed off. The owner tried to make it up to us and told us they gave out knives instead cause people complain that their scissors are dirty. Um wash them then?? 

As we left our tip, the server told us we lowballed her outloud..like you dont say?? You think every place gets at-least 10%. So appalling. 

Needless to say, we WONT be back."}
{"text":"Nice, new place for dim sum, available all day. White tablecloths, attentive service, fresh food and lots of varieties of dim sum that you don't always see in other places. A/C cranking is a great thing in 110 degree heat, too."}
{"text":"Food here is great but unfortunately the service is really lacking, even for a Chinese place..."}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars
This review is for dim sum. They have a pretty standard dim sum menu with small, medium, and large dim sums going at $2.30 each from Mondays to Fridays. Their dim sum is nothing spectacular but it's not bad and comparable to most other dim sum restaurants. Standard dim sum menu selection. No novelty or fusion items. 
Apparently deep fried taro paste amd shrimp dumpling is one of their more renowned items and it was actually quite good. I would recommend trying it out if you're there. 

Ambiance: 2.5 stars
The restaurant is located in an old and slightly run  down plaza, so naturally the restaurant itself is in need of a bit of renovation. It is usually more of an elderly crowd since it's across from a retirement home. It can get a bit loud at peak hours but that's how most dim sum places are. 

Service: 3 stars
3 stars for standard dim sum service. I don't really go expecting any outstanding service so I don't leave disappointed. My table got everything we asked for so that's good enough for me."}
{"text":"I know this place is pretty new, but worst customer service... very slow service! They have few server, but they dont even go and ask the customer what they need... go to changs, orchids or ping pang pong restuarant... Been here twice for their dim sum, both experienced weren't good..."}
{"text":"I have never had dinner here so this review is only for the dimsum. Affordable and decent dimsum. No push carts here though. I believe its about 2.60 per dish during certain hours. Nontheless, the suimai is excellent. They don't drown your rice rolls in soy sauce either and leave it on the side which I liked. There's two levels for dining so when it gets full upstairs, we usually sit downstairs although that dining area is usually empty. Washrooms are decently clean. Expect lots of elderly people at this place as the seniors building is right across."}
{"text":"I've been to almost all dim sum places here in LV so far this is the best! All dim sums were tasty and fresh. This place will be my regular dim sum place"}
{"text":"Great food, open late. Very kind people and if you're looking to eat some Chinese then go here. UnFORTUNATE they don't give FORTUNE cookies."}
{"text":"Terrible. Terrible. The service is terrible. You should not have to remind the servers what do you order. They don't write anything down. Only one cart for dim sum. By the time they get to you there's nothing left in the cart. I would not recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Poor service. Waited for more than 15 mins and finally called someone that works there because no one even bothered to talk to us. Never will we go back to this place!!"}
{"text":"My family keeps bringing me back here even after I express how much I dislike this place. There's no saving grace. Seriously. 

Most of the items on the menu are mediocre. The so-called eel rice that has to be ordered in advance? It's okay, but it's not good enough to be constantly ordered by my family. We usually end up with the entire thing as leftovers if we order it. 
I'm trying to rack my brain to think of items that were great, but any of the better items here could be done much better at other Chinese restaurants. 

Service is... well, what'd you really expect? They're not necessarily rude, but they also don't get the hint that after they do their job they should let us enjoy the meal and stop trying to sell drinks to us. Yes, I understand it's their job to accommodate their customers and encourage more spending, but if I've said no thank you once, I don't need to be snapping at you five minutes down the conversation. 

I'm only being super nitpicky because I've probably been to this restaurant more than anyone else on Yelp, so I still don't like it. There are better places down the street. Really. (Still going to give two stars though, because the owner of the restaurant is actually pretty nice)."}
{"text":"I wish this restaurant had a better smell to it aside from the grease interceptor sewage funk. The service was what was to be expected from a Chinese restaurant. We were ignored, passed up for other Chinese patrons, and eventually served. Go figure. The food itself was good. Dim sum was yummy and fresh. I'd suggest take-out for this restaurant. Maybe."}
{"text":"Nothing special - you don't have the ladies coming around all the time to give you dim sum choices. You actually had to wave them down to get them to come by the table. Overall, the items that we got were typical and nothing special. But, if you want to get your dim sum fix and you're close by, stop by and it's not expensive either."}
