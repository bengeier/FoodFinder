{"text":"Giving 5 stars for the customer service and 5 stars for the sandwich.   Mike was VERY nice and very accommodating. My office mate and I each ordered a build your own sandwich. We both had the oven roasted turkey and other fixings. The turkey is really good and the sandwiches had great flavor and tasted very fresh. We will definitely be ordering again!!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, friendly staff.  I really like their Asian Special, but I get it with turkey instead of pork."}
{"text":"It's refreshing when you stumble upon something new. I'm a fan of sandwiches... I have been since I was knee high to a grasshopper. I've become used to the chain places... which is why the freshness of Sin City Sandwich stands out.   I've eaten lunch here twice in the last week. The choices and combs are endless and can meet any desired taste you have for that day.  If you're town down... give it a shot."}
{"text":"Great find. Was visiting in Vegas with family. Near the courthouse, so seems a quick bite for attorneys etc. 2 grandchildren and three adults all enjoyed our lunch. Weather allowed us to eat outside. Owner came out to check up on us. Real nice touch."}
{"text":"This sandwich shop replaced City Centre Cafe. Familiar faces from City Centre Cafe and the Quiznos that used to be next door greet you upon entering. I ordered the Regional sandwich (turkey, cheddar, cranberry apple Greek yogurt, lettuce, onion and tomato on wheat bread), which was today's special. Priced at $6.99 instead of the usual $7.99, with a bag of chips, my total was $8.90. A bit pricey for a sandwich and bag of chips, but the sandwich was freshly made and quite filling. Not an ideal place for your typical government worker to grab a meal on a daily basis, but great for a weekly or monthly splurge."}
{"text":"Wow. What a lunch!  We couldn't decide what to eat so we decided to share an Asian Special, Regional and Shrimp Tempura Tacos.  I also ate their Jalape√±o Cheddar Chips and a cookie.  Everything was soooo good - nice soft bread, tasty meats, unique sauces and fresh veges to top it all off.  My only problem - no one is here to give me a piggy back ride to my car.  I ate too much!  Help! PS  Please keep your Shrimp Tempura Tacos on the menu.  I love that your shrimps are baked!   They had the perfect amount of crunch to them.  It's so nice to have tempura that isn't oily (ewww).  I can't wait to come back and put more in my face.  NOMS."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! Fresh avocado! Oven roasted meats are delicious! Glad to finally have a real deli style sandwich shop near downtown!"}
{"text":"In town on business and needed a quick lunch.   Great sandwich \"the Vig\", very friendly staff."}
{"text":"After a mishap with the online ordering system, I was personally contacted and they made it right. I get it, glitches happen. If ordering again, I'd probably call it in, just to be safe. The sandwich I got was pretty good. Nothing fancy, but better than average. I'd stop in if I were in the area."}
{"text":"I recently stopped by this place and am I so glad I did. Sandwiches made with fresh roasted meats! It's been so long since I have been in a shop that actually roasts their own meats, it makes such a difference. There is a great variety of options to outfit your sandwich, veggies, homemade sauces, homemade pickles, much homemade goodness. The owner Mike, super nice. Do yourself a favor and check this place out."}
{"text":"The owner was friendly and so generous! He gave my kids lemonade and a sandwich on the house, which was unexpected.  The sandwiches were delicious! The bread was soft on the inside and flaky on the outside, the turkey was fresh and homemade (not your typical lunch meat), the spicy pickle slaw was different and very flavorful, and the firecracker sauce was spicy, but not overdone.   I will definitely return if I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Decent sandwich, though I was really weirded out that the lady preparing mine didn't use gloves."}
{"text":"The best roast beef in town.  Better quality sandwich than any Subway or Quiznos and at a great price.  My favorite lunch spot when I'm in that area."}
{"text":"I work across the street from this place and one of my coworkers has breakfast hear everyday.  I decided to give it a try and thought the food was okay.  The prices are a bit high and the portions are on the small side but my waistline likes it that way.  Sin City Sandwich has quite a following and I like how they keep upping their advertising game.  They have signs and stuff all around and you cannot miss the place.  The breakfast sandwich I had was very good!  I know some people will think three stars is low for a positive review but the Yelp definition is A-OK and that is how I found the place."}
{"text":"I love sandwiches, so I'm always interested in trying something that's not Subway. They had many different sandwiches to choose from (some typical sandwiches and quite a few you won't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"Wow! I had the small roast beef sandwich and it was plenty of food for lunch, very generous meat portion on the bread, which was fresh baked. Perfectly medium rare roast beef, fresh veggies, delicious sauce and they had this spicy red pepper relish they put on it that was a flavor explosion!  I loved it!  I will be coming here for lunch every time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love stopping by this place. They have a great variety of sandwiches depending on your mood and the prices are spot on.  I usually get the regional, which is fantastic.  Their monthly/weekly specials are also amazing, especially the gyro tacos! Also, this place gets an extra star for the GREAT customer service that I get every single time I come in.  They are so fast and courteous and always offer to help me out any way they can."}
{"text":"After what seemed like forever shipping out boxes over at the fed ex a couple blocks over, I was definitely hungry for something quick and  close by for I still needed to come back to do some more paper work for my shipping. Luckily these guys were right down the street was highly recommended by the fed ex folks.  First thing that caught my eye was the \"Federal\" ($7.99) which was roast beef, sin city sauce, pepper relish, lettuce, onion, and tomato on a hoagie roll. Comes with dill pickles on the side. Of course I wanted a drink so I ended up getting the combo ($10.98) which was a 20 oz fountain drink and chips.  Now this roast beef was some of the best I have had in a long time. This is definitely not like the roast beef at Arby's. This was the real deal. So very fresh and lots of flavor. The sandwich is a pretty good size and its cut in half. All the stuff that was in it gave it lots of flavor.   Service was quick and efficient. You order at the counter, pay, and they bring it out to you. I think even the owner asked me several times if everything was ok.  Some useful info. No, there is no free wifi. They do have a bathroom. Business hours are Monday thru Friday 7:30 am to 3:30 pm. Fountain drinks are free refills. They have coke products.  In closing, I think that if I ever get stuck over at fed ex or are in the area for any reason, stopping by here is a major possibility. I am curious about the other sandwiches as well but I cant stop thinking about that roast beef. Total I paid was almost 12 bucks which to me, lunch should never go over 10 bucks in most cases. Other than that, I am definitely a fan of this sandwich joint.  Yelp 2015 Review #40 \"Get the roast beef!\" 539 overall"}
{"text":"Normally like this place but the lady behind the counter was very rude, and didn't even bother to heat up the sandwich I ordered, although it is supposed to be hot.  I didn't bring it up since I don't plan on going back.  News flash--if you are done serving people then just close.  Don't invite people into your restaurant just to act like they are being a burden.  Not everyone gets lunch from 12-1."}
{"text":"Best lunch in the downtown 702!!  Management really goes out of its way to make sure you are personally satisfied as well.  Ran how a small business should be ran. Give the tacos a try.  I had the pork on the regular flour tortillas and loved it.  Seems weird on paper but fantastic in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Finally a sandwich spot with freshly cut meat. Everything here is fresh and made to order. The owner Michael is such a caring person and you can tell he loves what he does. He gave me a sample of the meats with different sauces. I decided to order the homemade meatball sandwich and my friend ordered the chicken loco with fresh avocados.   The meatball sub was delicious. Mike even gave me extra sauce which I recommend to everybody so you can dip your bread into. The meatballs were tender and seasoned just right. Not to salty but just right.   I took a couple bites of the chicken loco and I must say the sauce was just right. It paired perfectly with the chicken.   I can't wait to come back to try a couple more different sandwiches.   If you're ever in the area make sure to try this place out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches - I particularly like their bread - and soup (I'm sure the other stuff is good too, but I haven't tried anything else yet). And service is quick and friendly. I'm glad this place is near my office."}
{"text":"What a great lunch experience! The owner was so kind, he started my kids with lemonade to drink while they waited.  The staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean, and the food was DELICIOUS!!!  We enjoyed a basic turkey and cheese, a tuna, and an incredibly flavorful turkey with spicy pickle slaw sandwich. The bread was obviously baked there, the veggies were fresh, and the sauces were unique and delicious.   The best part, however, was the turkey! It tasted like the Thanksgiving leftovers I drool over every year!   You've got to try this place!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches were delicious, and they brought us a little bonus as we were devouring our sandwiches... Chocolate chip cookies!!!! Gotta try!"}
{"text":"This place has real good sandwiches and they are healthy too.  However, the dinning room is a little small so they would prefer you take your food on the good."}
{"text":"I was downtown to visit Fremont street and decided to try this place because of the Yelp reviews and was very disappointed. It's basically a subway..? The sandwiches were mediocre at best. The girls making the sandwiches were nice, but I could make a better sandwich at home."}
{"text":"Sin City Sandwich is amazing! Fresh food, great prices, always delicious! The staff are so nice and cater to your every need. They do such an awesome job! Keep it up Sin City Sandwich!"}
{"text":"I have been on jury duty for 7 days and have tried seven different restaurants near the courthouse and Sin City Sandwich by far has been the best meal.  I had the Chicken Loco sandwich and it was very delicious and fresh.  I will definitely visit this restaurant again.  Viva Sin City Sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh food and great service.  My first time here I ordered \"The Regional\".   Lots of moist, thick, seasoned turkey meat on my sandwich.  I also liked the cranberry yogurt sauce, next time I will ask for extra.  Free freshly baked cookies all month! The owner is really nice, the cookies were not ready when I stopped by this morning and he offered to deliver some to me and co-workers.  I will definitely be back.  The quality of food is definitely a step up from the previous ownership and I'm so glad they kept the same employees.  Maria is so nice."}
{"text":"Fresh, quality ingredients, and very good prices. They offered me samples of three or their sauces, and all three were truly unique, as advertised, and absolutely delicious. All the employees were very nice. I was nearby for work, and I hope I will be nearby more often, because I would love to come to this place again. Terrific sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Great for the morning coffee and muffin on the way to jury services. Look for the red umbrellas on Lewis and 3rd."}
{"text":"Work downtown and there are many options for lunch.  Tried this place for the first time and found a new favorite.  Had the \"Asian\" Special....wow what an awesome sandwich!  The dragon fire sauce and spicy pickle slaw they put on the sandwich are amazing.  Portions are huge too. Looking forward to trying more menu items."}
{"text":"Delicious, freshly made sandwiches made with house-cooked meats. Friendly staff and reasonable prices. Soups and salads too. Breakfast early.   High recommended."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches I love the roast beef great service to I wish this place was closer to my house"}
{"text":"I went here 3 times just to make sure. Things happen. I don't know if it's this same employee I keep getting or the shop in general but the employees (this one in particular) don't even know the menu. If you order a specialty sandwich be prepared to tell them what's on it, because they don't know. The roast beef is so extremely rare and I usually like my meat bloody but this is eh. It's also clumped on the sandwich so much so that when you take a bite the whole sandwich falls apart. Frist time I went was decent, second time I couldn't even order because the employees were so unaware of their own menu and today I just threw out a whole sandwich it was that bad. I have faith this place could be great with a little work."}
{"text":"So fresh and deliciously amazing! I ordered the small Chicken Salad with a side of Tomato Basil soup.  Super hearty and filling. My salad had romaine, kale, spinach and mushrooms, carrots, black olives, pickled yellow peppers, pepper jack and oodles of fresh sliced chicken breast. The Sin City Sauce or dressing or whatever you call it was amazing and I could have used another little cup of it.  Service was awesome as I had it delivered to my office.  Definitely spreading the word at the Clark County Government Center!!!"}
{"text":"Funny story. I never went to the shop. I just got back from work and have been on a very restricted \"diet.\" Needless say I was starving. My son left a sandwich on the counter and I completely DEVOURED it! OMG chipotle chicken, pepper jack and whole wheat to die for. So I just texted my son to \"confess my sin\" of eating his lunch. He tells me where he got it and offered his \"forgiveness.\" My only wish.... Please stay open longer so us working people can make it in after work like until 6 pm and how about open for a few hours on Sunday so my church that meets downtown at the Western can enjoy some \"sinful\" sandwiches... LOL!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite to eat. Tried the Asian special and loved it. The food is high quality and delicious. The staff is very friendly. A must try if you are around!"}
{"text":"Since I wrote my first review back on July 14, I have been back to SC Sandwich over half dozen time trying both the sandwiches and clam chowder. Unfortunately, these recent experiences have led to one lower star rating and here are why: The sandwiches are still good, but no longer great. They no longer have the wow and the \"OMG!!!\" factor. They used to pack a huge amount of meat into the sandwiches, but now the amount is just average. The meats were awesome before, but now are just a little over average. As for the clam chowder, the first 3 times after the owner Mike replied to my review, the clam chowder was so good. However, the last few tries have been bad (sour, watery, salty). The biggest mistake that was made with the clam chowder was leaving it in a powered off pot at room temperature and then reheating it with Styrofoam cup in the microwave. This is the main reason I lowered my star rating. Overall, this is not a bad place for sandwich if you're close by. The owner and most of the staff are very nice."}
{"text":"Got a turkey sandwich on a French roll. It was an average sandwich and very mess. Fell apart after 2 bites"}
{"text":"Found this amazing sandwich shop here on yelp and would like to say the reviews are spot on. Great folks at the counter and incredible food."}
{"text":"The children that work there are kind of rude. And the sandwich was subpar. I definitely wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"Three words BOMB DOT COM!!!!!! The sauces are AHHHHH-MAZING Sancwiches are DELISH and entire staff is AWESOME!!! Can't go wrong with any choice!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this cute little sandwich shop walking around downtown. Stopped in for a drink end up getting smoothies. THEY ARE DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"Better than it looks when you walk in, but definitely doesn't deserve the reviews it gets. Subway style sandwich place, boring sandwiches. Nothing wrong with this place, just nothing great about it either. Fine if you have no other options."}
{"text":"I tried shrimp tempura tacos, the Asian special, the regional, and avocado smoothie. I liked them all bc these are not regular sandwiches we can get from other places. Sauces and pickles make a big difference! Of course you can make your own as well. Smoothie was rich and creamy and had the right amount of sweetness. Cannot wait to try Nutella banana frappe next time. Mmm!!!"}
{"text":"Wish I lived closer...I'd be stopping by here often! Great sandwich: soft awesome bread, meats cooked daily in-house, and super friendly owner willing to let you sample anything before making a purchase. Stop in when you're stuck with jury duty like I did! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I gave this sandwich shop another shot and I have to say my experience was so much better when I avoided the Asian wrap, as I predicted.  On my second occasion I ordered the Regional. The flavors were great and I would definitely order this again, minus the yogurt sauce since it was a little sweet for my taste. They allow you to customize your order any way you like which is great and service it outstanding.   The owner and staff really care and want to make sure everyone's experience is up to par by checking in regularly and offering free samples."}
