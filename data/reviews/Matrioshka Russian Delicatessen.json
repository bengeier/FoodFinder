{"text":"Matrioshka is a cozy little Russian delicatessen on 14th St SW. The tiny shop has a modest selection of imported dried and canned goods and sweets. If you bought one of each of their item, it might fill half your pantry. But, in Matrioshka's, it's more about the homemade frozen delights they have to offer than the scant selection. I did say the store was tiny, after all! 
What isn't tiny, however, is the portion of perogies that $8.50 will get you - two dozen. Moreover, they also have homemade borscht and cabbage rolls available. I don't know about you, but making a meal out of those three staples sounds like a damned fine feed to me! 
So head on down to Matrioshka's Deli and buy yourself a righteous Russian repast - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST PEROGIES and BEST BORSCHT in town (and such a steal)... get the sauerkraut one and the sour cherry perogies for dessert. You'll thank me.  The borscht is more of a stew with thick cuts of shredded cabbage and beets. It's my fav and I'm a borscht snob. Try it. You'll love me for it."}
{"text":"they carry all the Candy I used to eat as a kid back home!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here and bought a few things, including yogurt.  When I got home and started eating the yogurt I found it had mold in it, when I checked the expiry date it had been scratched out.  Watch out for what you buy here!"}
{"text":"Perogies 2 dozen for $8.50! Delicious but they are much smaller than Perogies u would find at the grocery store. Huge candy selection which is great. However took home some cabbage rolls, these seemed to be stuffed with rice and carrots and a speck or 2 of beef. All you can taste are carrots.  I also got a hair in one :("}
{"text":"On a mission to teach our kids more about different cuisines and cultures we decided to seek out Russian food for dinner one night.  This cute little deli is very noticeable on 14th Street SW but you could almost miss it if you didn't take the time to pull over and explore (which you should).

From the moment we walked in we were cheerily greeted by the happy lady working in the back.  We took our time and browsed through all the intriguing items on the shelves, in the cooler(s) and even had to try hard to guess at some things since we could not read Russian.

Having a mix of Ukrainian and German in me I was well versed in the cuisine consisting of borscht, sauerkraut, perogies and cabbage rolls....all staples from my childhood.

So we decided our supper would be borscht, a spicy carrot salad, perogies (potato/bacon, cheese/potato), cabbage rolls, a huge roll of Kiev salami, and a bag of bread sticks shaped like an O.  Fantabulous.  We bought it, drove home, warmed and cooked what we needed to and sat down to feast.  Every bite was super tasty and delicious. 

The one item we didn't get and will come back for is the cherry perogies (drooling).

This cozy little deli is chalked full of Russian delicacies and a place you should check out."}
