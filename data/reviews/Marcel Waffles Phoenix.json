{"text":"Ahhh-mazing!!!!!!! Got to try this waffle truck today at work and had THE BEST spicy chicken and waffle ever. No joke. Waffle was light and fluffy with a bit of sweetness to it...ohhh, and perfectly cooked. Then the chicken....2 large pieces of fried chicken might I add....the chicken is delicious and got a kick to it which pairs perfectly with the syrup. It does come with a relish that is freshly made; however, I didn't eat it. Looked and smelled good tho.  Another reviewer said to find this truck and follow it. I now know why!!!!"}
{"text":"The presentation pretty much says it all. This place was AMAZING! Waffles for lunch was such a good idea and even better as a food truck. The two guys working it were really nice. I had myself the fantastic fruit which was a freshly made belgain waffle with mixed berries and sliced bananas topped with whipped creme and a drizzle of chocolate. Is your mouth watering yet? Because mine still is. They have a full list of other variations of waffles. Each order that came out looking just as amazing as my own. It was definitely Instagram and snap worthy. Ha! I must mention too it was quite a generous serving and well worth the price. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day so I was very excited as you can imagine me finding this gem parked out near my work. It was so delicious! I hope the swing by a few more times each week."}
