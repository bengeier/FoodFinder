{"text":"Manuel's Mexican Restaurant on Southern Ave. has always offered good, quick Mexican food. I've visited here for more than 10 years, and the food is always consistently high quality. I particularly like the green corn tamale with rice and beans (AKA, \"Mix and Match\"). The shredded beef taco is also tasty. My husband always gets the Fiesta Platter, theoretically an appetizer, because it has a bunch of little items to sample.   For the past 10 years or so, the same friendly gentleman has served us the chips and wonderful Manuel's salsa. I think it shows that Manuel's is a quality restaurant for someone to work there for so long! Manuel's isn't fancy, but their food and friendly service keeps my family coming back again and again. Try it!  UPDATE: This location has the best \"balloon sculpture guy\" I've ever seen! If you have a kid, call ahead to see what nights the guy works. Yes, he really is that good.  (Note that this review ONLY applies to the Southern Ave. location. We have been very disappointed by other locations...)"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food i've had in the east valley!  Great service, awesome chips and salsa!  I'm sure theres better places in the valley, but this is around the corner from where I live, and we've been regular customers since 2007.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Gone down hill the past few years. SLOW service, food was bland and warm at best. There are better places to spend your hard earned money for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review for quite a while. This place isn't \"the best\" Mexican food around if you're part of the Scottsdale crowd. IT IS affordable, consistent and always a great atmosphere!  I suggest going for happy hour. It's from 3-6 and includes a nice sample of food and drinks.  Outside of happy hour I prefer the 3 Amigos enchiladas. You can't go wrong with these flavors and that side of rice and beans.   Don't forget to ask for the hot salsa!  Other favorites include the chicken cheese crisps, chicken taquitos and Mexican pizza.  This place is great and make sure to sit in the cantina."}
{"text":"Bottom Line: Manuel's has the best chips and salsa.  Compare to any Mexican food in the Phoenix area and you will find a unique slightly sweet, yet spicy and perfectly textured salsa.  They have been making it for years and never faltered.  Beyond the salsa, the fejitas (\"for one\" is enough to split, at least for us), the green corn tamale and the chimis are all top notch.  I would recommend any of these without hesitation.  Also, try the spinach queso and ask for the flour chips (instead of standard corn), they add a special element to the dish that I've never found anywhere else.  Recommendation: Ask for Luis, he's usually serving in the bar and will add a personal touch to the service.  We always feel welcome when we find him there and even plan to go when we figure he's working!"}
{"text":"Que Onda Guero?  By The Rue  Chimichanga wasn't from the gutter, But I should have eaten peanut butter, The food didn't make me bust a nutter, I'll bet you like to drink Coors Cutter.  I will say though the service was great, I'm pretty sure my waiter's name wasn't Kate, Why is everyone so full of hate? I think this weekend I'll go skate.  The chips and salsa were unimpressive, The lunch prices were a bit excessive, When making out I'm not real aggressive, And I don't get jealous or possessive.  This place is popular with the older crowd, Lots of senior citizens speaking loud, Come in at happy hour and get yourself plowed, Go home with someone well endowed.  Another thing I liked was their ice tea, I'm a fan of taking road trips to sightsee, Years ago I sported a goatee,  Boost your immune system with vitamin C.   TOSTADA!!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Manuel's for 30 years.  It's the best Mexican food in the valley!  I love the location on Southern and Carlos and Marcos always take the best care of me.  I can't say enough about the delicious salsa, amazing Spanish rice, and crazy good food.  You can't go wrong with anything you order.  The green corn tamale is to die for and OMG, I almost forgot to mention the soup!  The albondigas soup is the best ever.  I have brought so many people there who are now loyal customers.  They are the BEST!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the convenience of their take out! I can call in our order and it will be hot and ready in 10 to 15 minutes. They are very nice and cheery when you come to pick it up!! One of our favorite neighborhood restaurants!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and each time has been excellent and memorable. The employees are personable and really make the experience enjoyable and beyond satisfying! They're quick and on top of things. The food is super tasty and arrives fresh and hot. I've had the seafood enchilada and the spinach enchilada and I'm looking forward to trying more of their options. And if you're looking for a great Margarita, get it here! It's a nice atmosphere with comfortable dim lighting and decor. Overall, Manuel's has given me one of the best experiences I've ever had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"It's great to have that favorite place very close to home, the best pizza, best subs, best bar, or your favorite Mexican food. Manuel's on Southern is our favorite Mexican restaurant close to home. We dine here regularly and I've never had a bad meal at this location. I cannot say that for other nearby places we frequent.  The staff is prompt, friendly and competent. We've never waited long for a table, food, drink or a check. And we have a favorite waiter, Ian the wannabe Mexican.  My go-to dish is the Three Amigo enchiladas but there are many good dishes I go back to when dining here. When I need a Sonoran food fix, this is my place. There's only one other cantina in the east valley I put at the same level as Manuel's. My fondness has reach the point where I assume any negative review comes from a person who does'nt know what they're talking about.  My only slightly negative comment will be their discontinuation of Bohemia Beer, and they could have a better tap and tequila selection."}
{"text":"I have come to Manuel's multiple times over the last 5+ years, as it's conveniently close to home. Not our 1st choice when seeking Mexican, even though it's nearby. The food is OK if you are looking for your basic, inexpensive Mexican fare- it is not highly seasoned and many items taste over-salted like they are fresh out of a box/can. The margaritas are so sweet we don't even order them anymore- tried them a few times over the years (disappointing, as the pricing is good!) - just tastes like your typical pre-mixed margarita with flavored syrup. The carnitas here are pretty good- a huge portion of food! All of the food portions are very decent sized. My biggest issue with this place is how DIRTY it is...way too much crap \"decorating\" the restaurant, and most of it is caked in dust...gross. WHY?? Management, please know you have customers wondering: if that's what the restaurant looks like, how clean is your kitchen...?!?! No bueno."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was very tasty for traditional Mexican fare. Worth the visit and would recommend."}
{"text":"I loved this place because of the good chips and salsa they had served us. The food was also very good with the great price! We will be coming again soon for sure"}
{"text":"Great service! Great food!! Chips and salsa always fresh. I get the chicken enchilada, so gooood!!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience there last night that I needed to share.  Had such pleasant, attentive service by our waitress(es - one was training), the courteous and pleasant gentleman who filled our chips/salsa (please and thank you and yes sir, etc), the balloon magician who made all the kids in the restaurant smile with his balloon animals and magic, and the food was really great.  Tampiquena is always tasty....  Good job to the staff to making our visit there last night so relaxed and pleasant."}
{"text":"Manuel's catered the food for my wedding this past weekend in Scottsdale.  All guests said the food was delicious!  The menu consisted of carne asada tacos, spinach enchiladas, rice, beans and calabasitas.  We also had chips, salsa and a fruit tray during the cocktail hour.  The service staff was very kind and helpful.  Additionally, Linda worked patiently with us to include vegetarian and vegan options on the menu.  The vegetarians and vegans loved the food."}
{"text":"The first thing I should talk about is the service. The waitress was nice, but the service was a little slow, especially considering that the restaurant was, maybe, a little over half full when I came in. The chips were fine, not great, but ok, and the regular salsa was average. I asked for a spicier salsa, and that was much better. For dinner, I chose two items from the mix and match section: a chicken enchilada and a green chile corn tamale, with a side of rice and beans. The chicken enchilada and rice were really enjoyable, more flavorful than most Mexican food restaurants I've been to. The tamale was not dry, but was a little bit sweeter than I thought it would be, but that is to be expected, because of the corn. The beans, however, seemed to have been sitting out for a while and heated up in a microwave, because the edges were dry. The flavor was fine, but I wish it had been a little more fresh. Overall, the flavor was between a three and a four, but the slow service knocked it down to a three."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food.  I had the fish tacos and they were really good.  Chips and Salsa were pretty good.  When it came time for the bill we though we were all square.  The server came back and told us the Deal Chicken Coupon had already been used.  We have never been to this restaurant, so we had never used the coupon.  The manager said it was used the day before in a Phoenix location.  We had to pay the entire bill, even though we had invested in 4 coupons for this restaurant.  The restaurant told us to contact the other restaurant to do some leg work.  They told us to contact Deal Chicken.  Deal Chicken told us to contact the restaurant.  Then Deal Chicken called the restaurant when we demanded our money back from Deal Chicken.  Within 5 minutes our Deal Chicken Coupon was good again.  Why they could not figure out that they had made a mistake when we were there waiting for about 30 minutes listening to them tell us we had already used the coupon.  We got our money back from Deal Chicken.  We will never go back.  They never even attempted to contact us to at least apologize.  Treating us like scam artist's instead of new customers!  Too bad we were looking forward to going back after finishing our meal.  Service was not the best.  For anyone who does not know Deal Chicken is a place where you can buy coupons for extra value at the business."}
{"text":"My family and i have literally been going here for 20 plus years now ... Manuels is top of the line when it comes to mexican food and the service they provide. I would reccomend this place to anyone and everyone! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night, and surprisingly , I had never been to this location before. What a nice surprise it was.  The staff was so lovely and kind. It was nice and clean inside.  Our server was very attentive to us as well as all his other customers.  It was a Friday so no Meat. I got fish tacos, loved them. M got bean enchilada and Rice and beans. I like Coffee with Mexican Food and the server made me a fresh pot.   I am looking forward to our next visit. I hope it is as great as last time."}
{"text":"Ordered the beef fajitas and a cheese crisp.  Both were delicious.  I had been raving about the restaurant Si Senor, but had just an ok experience there 2 weeks back.  I actually think Manuel's has them beat.  This will be my \"go-to\" Mexican place going forward.  The fajitas were very flavorful and the onions/green peppers were still crunchy.  I had awful onions/green peppers last time at Si Senor...very mushy and greasy. Be aware however that Manuel's only give you 2 flour tortillas which would never be enough for the amount of beef - you can easily make 3-4 fajitas, so be sure to ask for an extra two tortillas."}
{"text":"Love Manuel's!  Great old Arizona style Mexican food.  Love the tacos, cheese crisps and the spinach enchiladas!  Great casual place, it's a go to place for the wife and I.  Don't forget to get the \"hot\" hot sauce!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Manuel's for, well let's just say a LONG time! I used to go to the one on Broadway until it closed. When I lived out of state I ALWAYS stopped at Manuel's on visits!   As the New Times has announced, they have the best salsa! I know there are various tastes out there and everyone is entitled to their opinion, but mine is that I like their salsa best, the margaritas, the cheese crisp, the fajitas, wait- it gets better... in N CAL, MI and IL I couldn't find a green corn tamale to save my life, so I learned how to make them and I will say I make them well! But, they are a lot of work and so I am happy to be back in the Valley of the Sun to get them at Manuel's! I prefer their chicken chimis to any place I have been because they actually season it nicely, not just chicken in a deep fried tortilla! The guac is great! Not made with a ton of jalapenos or strange ingredients! The flan is the best I have had! The sopapillas are little now, I kind of like the bigger squares, but they still taste good!  Now, let me tell you about the service! They have some of the greatest staff- Luis, Marcos, Jerry, Carlos, these guys are the BEST!!!!  Well, I will say that the Indian School location has some problems, the flan is curdly and there were a couple other differences, including service. I don't know why this is, but I just go to the one on Southern that I know will be great!  All in all this is the only place I like to go for Mexican food. I have tried a great many here and in other states and I always go back to my favorite, Manuel's! Maybe I'll see you there sometime!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with co-workers and we were ALL very pleased with both the food and service! Happy to find a Mexican restaurant with a good rice/beans situation. Our server was great. Very nice and prompt with food,drinks and bill. I know this place has been around for a while, wish I would've checked it out sooner now."}
{"text":"I've been coming here as long as I can remember. Seriously the best chips and salsa in the planet. I've had everything, rellenos, tacos, burritos, tamales... everything is delicious. You really can't go wrong. They will do gluten free as well."}
{"text":"The food must be made by someone who loves chili.  Our experience of 10 people had all their rice and soups super spicy that most of us couldn't enjoy. The waiter simply blow it off as oh well, maybe tomorrow it'll be better.  What ever you do don't assume it's not going to be spicy when it shouldn't be.  We will probably never go there again and I'll be sure to not recommend this Mexican Restaurant to anyone.  I'm sure if the original owners were still around the would have gave a shit or two about their customers experience. Currently the management and waiters don't give a dam except how much money they will make off of you.   Totally Disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"After about 15 years of being a patron, I was treated so rudely I doubt I'll ever return. The bartender kept his back to me the entire time I waited and when someone walked by he asked them to \"deal with me.\" That person was busy. I was leaving clearly disgruntled and nobody cared! I spoke with the \"manager\" DAN who offered nothing more than to speak to his staff after another apology he slammed the phone down hanging up on me!!!! As a business owner, I would never find this acceptable to our customers and the \"manager\" didn't try to keep me after 15+ years of weekends, parties, holidays, you name it this was our place. No more.... in shock!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is descent. Nothing is extraordinary. The kids had grilled cheese sandwiches that they loved. My wife and I had fajitas for two. There wasn't even enough meat for two fajitas. I was a little shocked, however the staff was nice."}
{"text":"The food was tasty and fresh.  Chips were wam and crispy and salsa was good.  While it was not the greatest Mexican north of the border, it was way above average.  What knocked it out of the park was the service.  Explained to the waiter we were in a hurry for a family reason and we got food right away with check right after it.  Assured us we did not have to rush but had everything ready so we could.  We will bring the kids and return  Good food and great staff."}
{"text":"Typical chain Mexican food, nothing great, but not a bad place to eat if 'typical' is what you are in the mood for."}
{"text":"Our family ate here a lot when we lived in AZ.  Last night I was in town and my folks wanted to go.  It has not changed a bit!    Outstanding salsa (you have to ask for the \"hot\" if you want it).  Great thin chips.  Prices seem to have gone up which is disappointing but you get plenty of food.  Nothing great to look at, not the best Mexican food in AZ, but good solid stuff."}
{"text":"If I could rate on the service of the waiter and the food, I would have given 5 stars. Noel was good, attentive, even offered my fiancé a free dessert when he saw the birthday card on the table. But I have to rate down because of two major concerns: 1) it took (no exaggeration) 30 minutes to get the first drink I ordered (the maraschino margatini) and 2) when I finally got it, it was not good at all. Noel was kind enough to swap it out for a house margarita which was delicious but that first drink was really bad. I'm still not sure why it took 30 minutes to make that; they weren't that busy? But I would go back; the salsa is by far some of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Manuel's in probably 5 years. Afterwards, I remembered why. While the food is good, it isn't great. There is better at several other local places. I probably would have given the food a 4 star but the restaurant was so hot that I just wanted out. I am actually someone that likes being warm but when it is over 100 degrees outside, I want to walk into a place and actually notice a difference in temperature. It was to warm to be comfortable.   The service was quick and friendly. They still have the best fried ice cream around. The chimis are good but not great. The refried beans were a little runny. Salsa is excellent. I would go back for another $15 for $30 deal like we got online but probably not without it. There are just to many choices in the area for a comfortable environment and excellent food."}
{"text":"I have eaten at a couple of other Manuel's.  I have eaten their food at events that they were catering too.  Their food is really good.  This was my first time at this location and I will say it was a nice experience.  We were here over the holiday so it was not busy.   I ordered the tacos with beans and rice.  The meat was really good.  The sides were good too.  I also enjoyed a nice bowl of albondigas soup too.  It was made in the Mexican style a lot different from my moms.  It was excellent too.  This place is close to my house and has good food and I will be back."}
{"text":"Nice, cozy place.  Come around lunch, the service is more memorable.  Avoid the magician if he's there without shoes.  Try the tampiquena plate."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! We've been hunting for a good \"go to\" Mexican restaurant and came here on the recommendation of some friends. Manuel's did not disappoint and surpassed our expectations. Very traditional menu with just the right amount of seasoning. Salsa was a good chunky tomato salsa with fresh tortilla chips! I tend to judge a restaurant by its crispy shredded beef tacos and enchilada sauce! Both were wonderful! Others in our group got the carne asada and fajitas. Everyone left very pleased. The little touches of crushed ice to drink down our coke products took us back to the small town AZ Mexican restaurant feel. Service was exceptional and felt as though our server went above and beyond. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food every time I've eaten here a few times this week and Nicole the bartender is absolutely amazing I don't know much about Mexican food so she gave me a new recommendation every night and I was definitely never let down all the food and drinks I've had over the past week have been well worth it."}
{"text":"1 star from someone from Massachusetts should say enough.  It was unimaginative, unflavorful, uninteresting, I could probably go on with the \"un\" words for quite some time, but I think you get the idea.  I had the Chile Relleno and it felt like I was eating an omelette with some bland chile in it.  This is Phoenix for crying out loud, there are much better options for Mexican food.  I found one the day after I ate here, it's a bit of a hike, but well worth it.  Check out my review for Los Taquitos in Phoenix for a much better option."}
{"text":"Very pleased. Met with friends from 20+ years ago and was not pressured. Took our time and enjoyed drinks and meal. Felix was excellent!!"}
{"text":"wow. i REALLY like average mexican food.  i grew up with manuel's, the original one in phoenix.  and i'm happy to say, this food is familiar and comforting to me.  it may not be the best, i can see how some may think it's just the worst. not me. me likey."}
{"text":"This place is always good.  They never disappoint.  Even my picky husband enjoyed his dinner."}
{"text":"I'he eaten here twice during the last 45 days - both Sunday nights. The food ROCKS!!! The ambiance is \"feels good\" and the service given by the waiter known as, \"Luis\" was complete. From recommending popular dishes to checking in to ensure satisfaction - Luis is the man! I had \"Pollo Especial\" which was outta sight! My date had vegetarian fajitas and she was pleased with the vegetable selection; noting they were different than other vegetarian fajitas she's had in the area.  Each entree was flavorful, filing and fun. 5 stars - Solid!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times. I love the salsa here and could probably make a meal of it.  The service has always been friendly, prompt and always accommodating. The food is average and comparable to other Mexican restaurants of its style. I'm probably not the best judge of Mexican food unless it's seafood style. I'm a lover of a good ceviche which I have yet to find in the Phoenix area...... Back to Manuel's, the restaurant always seems to be clean and tidy. The margarita special on Monday night seems to be a hit. When I come here with my mom and her boyfriend, they both order one, she drinks hers, her boyfriend drinks about a quarter of his and hands it off to her. Down the hatch! Lol. She really loves them here.  I will be back, as it is a nice consistent place to eat  They are willing to make things not on the menu and change around things that are. Nice :-)"}
{"text":"Great good real Mexican food and price was right good happy hr was great"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and love the food. Tonight, we (my husband, myself and our son) ordered our food and four people got seated next to us. One of the patrons was drunk and obnoxious. He was dropping f bombs and used the p word several times. Half way through our meal,  I excused myself and went to the front and requested to go boxes and our check so we could get out of there. I was afraid that if we had to sit there any longer, words would have been exchanged and things would have got ugly. What a total disappointment."}
{"text":"One of my favorite mexican cuisine restaurants.  Been coming here often on for several decades.  The chile rellenos and green corn tamales are the best! Cheese crisps are fantastic w/ green chiles.  Service treats you like family."}
{"text":"I just visited here and I am so happy! This was some of the best Mexican food I have had. The beans and rice were so flavorful along with my beef tacos. Excellent! I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Menudo was pretty good, would come again after church on Sunday. Was not happy with the small limes. Had to add salt and pepper to the menudo  to give it better taste. Staff was great."}
{"text":"Manuel's catered a meal for us a work. It was so good I can't wait to visit the restaurant. Muy Delicioso!"}
{"text":"Quality food, amazing service. Solid portions sizes. I love the machca dinner and the cheese crisp. Best mexican food in town."}
{"text":"Compared to the ones in northern Phoenix, this one misses the mark. Service is great, staff is friendly. Chips are thin, bland and stale. Salsa is chunky and lacks flavor (did the recipe change or is it different than other locations?) Other food was pretty good. I'm in from out of town, so chances are good I won't return to this one again, but over all it wasn't awful.  Kids eat free on Wednesday, so that was a bonus."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for many years. I had not been here for about 4 years now. So a long over do visit! This place is simple, simple and good!  It is very clean inside, including the restroom. The staff is great. We had a great male server. Sorry to say I cannot remember his name.   Chips and Salsa fresh and great!   Enchiladas are fresh and tasty.  I did not realize that Mexican food could be so bad till I went to a place in Scottsdale called , Jalapeno inferno! Because, of my Visit there I found how much I really appreciate Fresh, good Mexican food. This place is worth your time. Worth your Money. Good price as well. Get it a go!"}
{"text":"I felt rushed when ordering as she stood there while I looked over the drink menu and made a decision. Food just had appetizers were not good at all. Tasted like ever cooked taquitos out  of the box."}
{"text":"Oh man! The shredded beef tacos are really tastey. Ask for the hot sauce. Service is usually quick and efficient. Food is always great!"}
{"text":"The manager staff is one of the worst that I have seen. I called ahead and talked to Denton and said that he would make received beans without lard for a group of 20 vegetarians. He said that he would be able to and we gladly made a reservation. Upon arrival, they said that they were unable to and Denton said he had no recollection of this conversation. Additionally, the Spanish rice has chicken stock. When we ordered entrees, we ordered without rice, but were unable to substitute for something we could eat. Additionally, some of the plates of food came out too salty. They offered to remake the plates, however in order to save them costs we asked they give us sour cream or guacamole to mix in to reduce the salt flavor to make it edible. When we received the bill, we were charged for each thing like it was an extra. It would have been nice if the waiter had told us it was an extra cost beforehand. Additionally, the female manager is the least understanding person I have ever met. She doesn't want to go out of her way to accommodate our diet. She just lost the business of 20 people. The restaurant was practically empty on a long weekend during dinner time, which is probably due to their high prices."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican food restaurants.  They have great food and great drink options.  I'll choose Manuel's over the competition just because of the flaka margitini."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner! Margarita happy hour$4. I'm a Mexican cook and this was good. Good service- excellent servers. We enjoyed enchiladas and tacos. Try it you will enjoy it. We were a little apprehensive about the 3 and half stars on Yelp- but it was very good!"}
{"text":"This is the worst place.  I ordered the seafood enchiladas and it came with shrimp so small, they were smaller than a dime. Bay shrimp are larger. And Krab with a K. Never, would I ever think that is what is in a seafood enchiladas.  The only reason I gave 2 stars is the wait staff tried hard to make it better.  Other people in my party were not happy with the food but we just got tired of trying to make sense of it."}
{"text":"Meh.  The building is old and smells musty.  They have no liquor license, so forget about a margarita.  The staff is very friendly.  The food is just 'decent'.  The tortilla soup is very salty with dry chunks of chicken.  The Pollo Especial was not very especial."}
{"text":"We stopped in today due to some high recommendations from our friends. Since it was lunch hour on a Thursday we were seated quickly since it wasn't too busy. The menu was large and the variety typical. The prices were a little high I thought. But the food was delicious. We tried the cheese crisps for appetizer along with the free chips and salsa. The salsa was excellent with the right combination of heat and freshness. My bf. choose the combination enchiladas which he was surprised how good the one with spinach was, as he would not have normally selected lol. However he was so hungry he didn't notice on the menu. I choose the chimi with steak. It was very delicious but I will seriously warn you if you a chicken like me for heat you might want to ask for not so much heat .  We also took home an order of albondigas soup, as it's the bfs favorite and he raved about it . Overall it's definitely worth a return trip."}
{"text":"We use to come here a lot years ago and it was great. However, the last 4-5 years it has went downhill. The food isn't as good and the prices are higher then ever. I shouldn't have to pay $13.50 for a tiny burrito. It did taste good, but it should be about $3 less for the size. I think if the prices were lowered I might come back. But at this point I think I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have lived in Tempe for forty years and don't remember visiting this place as a kid. It was nearby too. Trying to get the wife and daughter to eat Mexican food is a challenge. I like Los Dos but they don't. Los Dos is still the best but we were pleasantly surprised at how good Manuel's really was. I will continue to eat here and enjoy the food. If you haven't been, give it a try; you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"We had happy hour in the bar, We started with chips and salsa they are the best in town next we had steak street tacos and beef taquitos  also very good.  The reason I am not giving them 5 star rating is the beer could have been colder."}
{"text":"Meh, the service was decent but the food was under whelming. Sometimes I wish this style of Mexican food would go out of style"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a long time, so tried it again last night.  We were pleasantly surprised that the food was still as good as we had remembered.  While there was a short wait for a table and the hostess was somewhat unaccommodating, the service was otherwise fine.  We like their salsa and chips, and everything we ordered was well prepared and appetizing.  Will definitely return now that we have tried it again."}
{"text":"Absolutely Love this place! I will say that you need to try the chilaquiles!! Great salsa, chips, beans, and rice. Been here a long time and I will continue to enjoy this place!!"}
{"text":"As always great food and great service! Larry is the best. We always split the fajitas for one and more then enough to eat. Although, we normally eat quite a lot of chips and salsa. How can you resist warm chips and some of the best salsa in town!!"}
{"text":"Lunch chimichanga, try the chicken or shredded beef. The carnitas is the best I have ever had.   Chips and salsa is the bomb.  Best Mexican in Arizona. Places needs a remodel but good people and great food.  Well worth it. Deserts are also very good. Best flan and fried ice cream ever. At the end of the day, it's a must try."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a number of times since my first review. The food is great. My shredded beef taco was stuffed full of tasty beef and the cheese enchilada was very cheesy (in a good way). My friend ordered a special plate. Our server was great. We were seated right away next to a lovely roaring fire. As always, the chips and salsa are outstanding."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant.  We were a big party of 16 with multiple checks.  The food was great, and the service was unbelievable.  The staff made sure that we were never out of chips and salsa or drinks.  We got constant attention.  Our server was so friendly and helpful, and he always had a smile.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for YEARS! This family owned local Az style mexican food place is my fave. Everything is always fresh and tasty. Service is always great."}
{"text":"I was looking for a New Mexican restaurant close to home and this is probably the best Mexican food I've had in a while. The tamales are to die for, and the rice and beans are really good. We had great service."}
{"text":"Omgoodness! I just ate at Manuel's for the first time and loved it! The food is delicious and reasonably priced (especially their daily specials and happy hour deals). The restaurant also has a clean, warm and friendly atmosphere, and the service was amazing!!! Seriously, so good!!"}
{"text":"The food is standard Americanized Mexican but it is still very tasty. The chips were fresh and the salsa was flavorful but not hot. I had the enchiladas and my gf had the fish tacos, both of which were good.  All of the staff was very nice and helpful.  However the food took a long time to come out."}
{"text":"Our 1st visit here. I really liked the chips and salsa!! The wait staff was friendly!!! It was a tad bit overpriced for the quality of food. 3 stars to start. The fajitas for 2 were slim pickens for 2 people.  We were only given 2 flour tortillas.  Each extra was .50.  Wow, they should have been free. The plate costs 33.50.  I could have had a whole 16 oz steak dinner for thus price.  Alwats room for improvement.b"}
{"text":"Love this place, the servers are always friendly and the food never disappoints.One of my favorite Mexican food places"}
{"text":"I have literally been coming here since I was in utero; I admit this may affect my affection for this restaurant.       Many families have a go-to family restaurant; every birthday, anniversary, et cetera takes place at one joint, and one joint only. This is my family's go-to joint for more than forty years.       Every region of Mexico, and formerly Mexico, has its own distinct style. Arizona is the blessed home of Sonoran-style, somewhat interchangeable with Navaho or Papago style. You can't really describe the differences of different styles of Mexican food, but suffice it to say that Sonoran style is unique from SoCal, Baja, NewMex, TexMex, Gaudal or any other type of Mexican food, and is my personal favorite.       To keep it short, the salsa is award-winning for a half-century now, and every item on the menu is a Sonoran variation of your favorite Mexican-cuisine anything. My family loves Beef Burro Enchilada-Style with Beans & Rice, my Papa loves Machaca Burro with extra peppers, I love Burrito Especial with Beans & Rice. In almost forty years I've never been disappointed, not even once.       If I could do 36-stars, one for every year I've been coming here happy & satisfied, I would do that."}
{"text":"Manuel's is better than your Serrano's or Garcia's but that's not saying much.  The chips and salsa are good. I usually get any variation of their Chimichanga, which is good but I've had better. This place use to be way cooler when they had the green chili costume and they use to dress up and dance for you on your birthday by request. WTF happened? It was the only thing I would look forward to when my wife's family would take me here. Try Cantina Laredo or Cravings before this place."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time, and was absolutely impressed. The staff was courtesy and welcoming. We were greeted immediately, and seated swiftly. Our server, Shea, was friendly and knowledgeable. She recommended the cheese crisp to start and we took her word for it. It is sooooo crispy- not blackened, and it was perfect. Try it with the chilaquiles or beef! Yum.  We tried an assortment of entrée items, and each was better than the last. Despite being a busy Friday night, the kitchen put our order out quickly, and everything looked as delicious as it tasted. I had the two item combo, with a cheese enchilada and carnitas burro (enchilada style) with the rice and beans. It was the best cheese enchilada I've EVER had- so gooey and creamy, and the sauce was on point! The burro was surprisingly simple, so as to showcase the quality pork inside- no need to fuss with stewed tomatoes and chiles, which I love, but  it's straightforward, and the pork is GOOD.  My husband had the Pollo Especiàl: chicken, stewed tomatoes, onions, chiles (did I mention I love those?), deep fried in a flour tortilla, then slathered with jalapeño cream cheese and smothered in their amazing Norteño salsa. This was magnificent.  Overall, it was some of the best Mexican food I've had in a long time. I grew up in PHX, and have tried Mexican food in S. CA, NM, and TX, and no one seems to do it the way we do it here. Definitely worth your time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the world! They've got the BEST salsa and their chips are amazing. One of the best parts about Manuel's is the jalapeño cream cheese that they put on their Pollo Especial. BUT...if you want the best dish they've got...get the Carne Tampiqueña and add some shrimp. You really won't regret it. Drinks are delish...servers are awesome...really nothing to complain about!!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant and the staff is super friendly especially Nicole... Her sense of humor and the fact that she remembers who we are what we drink and our favorite meals and appetizers is a huge plus for us..... We love coming here and will continue to do so...."}
{"text":"I placed a review of Manuel's last month, and it isn't here, that is odd. Actually, I placed 2 reviews. The first was a rave about this place. My family also has been coming here for years and on very special occasions. Usually the food and service are great!  Especially the chips and salsa. In fact, we always try to have their salsa in our fridge at home. However, I was having a \"poor me\" day, so I went to Manuel's by myself. It wasn't busy, but I was rushed through my meal and my bill was placed on the table, and the waiter stated to me, \"pay on your way out!\". I have never had that happen before, so I just looked at him, so he said it again. It sounded more like \"get out!\". I told the hostess about this while the manager was there, and apparently they did not have an issue with it. No apology, nothing. In fact the manager looked annoyed that I brought it up. Manuel's: you need to step up your game!  And you need to remove the seeds in your chili relleno!"}
{"text":"My go to spot when I need some Mexican food! All the staff are friendly and has a fun atmosphere. Got a restaurant side as well as a bar. They'll keep your drinks full and the chips and salsa coming."}
{"text":"I've been going to Manuel's with my family for years. They have very good chips and salsa, it's definitely their strong point. Unfortunately they no longer carry black beans and their refried beans contain lard. As a vegetarian, I cannot eat here any longer unless I want just chips and salsa or a cheese crisp.  Sad, sad day :'("}
{"text":"I just ordered this take out tonite and thinking it was going to be amazing i was highly disappointed. The only reason i am giving one star is because the mini chimis were pretty good everything else tasted horrible. The beans tasted like they were from a can and not fresh. The guacamole was bland and also tasted like the chili in it was from a can. I would think it is suppose to be fresh veggies not instant garbage. Wasnt worth the money i spent. I will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Manuel's is one of our favorites. The prices are a little higher than we'd wish for, but Manuel's makes sure you're well fed for what you pay for. They're generous with their meat inside tacos and enchiladas and other similar items, which is the first place most restaurants usually skimp out. Rarely have I received the wrong item. The chips and salsa are the best. The service can be slow, but is usually good. We've used them for catering too, and it's always a big hit. We love supporting a true Arizona business and it's evident they're invested in our community.  We patronize both this location, and when we're with family who live up there, the Scottsdale location. This Tempe location is far superior to the Scottsdale location in taste, ambiance, and service quality."}
{"text":"This is not a favorite spot of mine. I'll explain. I come here every now and then when someone invites me to eat, but this wouldn't be my first choice. Now don't get me wrong the customer service and employees are great but since it came under new management the food is different and overpriced. Something else that I really don't understand. A Mexican dish usually comes with beans AND rice. This place you get beans OR rice with a dish. Really?  Not only is it overpriced but I have to pay extra for a side that should come with a dish. Thats like peanut butter with no jelly on a sandwich unless I pay extra. Other places serve both. When I cooked at a Mexican restaurant we served both beans and rice. Don't even get me started on their desserts. This place needs to get with the program. Many people may love this place and think its bomb but someone such as myself who has worked in the restaurant/food industry for many years I know better. The 2 stars are for the staff and customer service. Maybe one day their dishes might earn some."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and have always enjoyed the food. In my opinion the best tamales ever. I recommend the beef tamales with red sauce. Manuel's is a Phoenix gem. They have been around since 1964. They offer a large variety of Mexican food. From tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas etc..  They have lunch specials from 11-4 everyday. Weekends are included. I had an awesome experience the other day. Jordan was wonderful. She was sweet, attentive and fun. It was nice to see someone so happy to be at work. The manager on duty was very nice too."}
{"text":"Was I impressed with this place? No. Not at all. Why?  First off, it was extremely hot sitting in this place like they had it set at a solid 78-80 degrees. Awesome :|  Second...A burrito that only comes with pico de gallo and guacamole on the inside with your choice of meat is weird to me. Where you have to pay extra for other ingredients? Stupid! I could understand switching out ingredients. The carne itself was good enough but not good enough for the burrito to be spectacular.  IDK if ill go back some day maybe if someone takes me ill give it a shot again."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years, in fact, I worked here as a server for a semester in college.  I've always loved the salsa here.  It has huge chunks of green chili in it and it's not spicy so you can eat a ton of it.  It's a problem I have actually!  I love their bean burritos and hard tacos, especially the chicken.  Their frozen margaritas are delicious and strong, so be careful!  They'll hit you quick!"}
{"text":"Bland food, chips wer really thin nd tasted stale nd the burrito i ordered tasted like it just come out of a microwave.. Im surprised it has 4.5 stars.. Not to mention its up fr a rennovation.. Go somewhere else fr a 9 dollar burrito.. Definately not coming back.."}
{"text":"The building, and it's a nice building, does not make you think anything approaching \"authentic\" (whatever that means) \"Mexican Restaurant\".  Skipping to the chase, service was slow, Margarita's were \"ok\" ($3.95 at happy hour), chips were \"ok\", salsa nothing special.  I had the Albondigas Soup and it was better than average.  Can't really think why I'd return, the experience was underwhelming.  Am posting a pik of the soup."}
{"text":"We came into Manuel's the other day as we were too early for our doctor's appointment next door. We expressed to our server that we had some time constraints and literally only 18 minutes to eat so we wanted to order things that were ready to go as they were in a lunch rush.  For some reason this was not enough time to get a dinner salad and tortilla soup to the table so we ended up having to get it to go.  The Pros:  My husband said that Manuel's had the best chips and salsa he had ever had and I agree. They serve crushed ice in their Fountain drinks. why doesn't everybody have crushed ice? It is amazing, and clearly it's the little things that make me happy. Kids eat free Wednesdays with the purchase of an adult entree.  The cons: We had to throw out both our food. The salad was wilted, the tomatoes were clearly old as they were dried up around the edges. I have a feeling if it was served tableside it would have been covered in dressing to hide this but you can't fool me, I know old food when I see it. The tortilla strips on top should be packaged in a separate container because they were soggy from the old tomato. I'm not sure what the dressing was it smelled a little tart to be Ranch.  The tortilla soup.... we just didn't like the taste of this and I had made tortilla soup from scratch the night before so I'm surprised that little ol' me could do better. Not just a little better. A lot better. This just tasted bad and the chicken was rubbery like the chicken you find in Campbell's soups.  Overall: So when all is said and done, we would come back to try some of the authentic dishes without time constraints -mostly just so we could have those delicious chips and salsa again   but Manuel's please don't serve bad food, I don't like throwing it out. I also hate wasting money. It makes me cry inside.  So don't serve bad food, so I don't have to feel bad later about it. K?"}
{"text":"I have been a regular of Manuel's for a year. It used to be my go to Mexican restaurant but unfortunately seems to have gone downhill lately. The chips and salsa are still good and the food is good, but not as good as I've had from here in the past. The last few times I've come here the service has been slow and our drinks never got refilled. Now Manuel's is average, but not bad. The bussers here who bring out the chips and salsa always do a great job though. One busser, Eduardo, is always so polite and attentative, he's great!  I should make a note that I visited on a Friday night and a balloon artist (?) was there. He was nice but honestly annoyed my date and I and strangely did not go to the table behind us which had a lot of kids at it who probably would have appreciated balloon animals a lot more."}
{"text":"Me and my wife came to Manuel's on my day off and while our kids were at their grandmas house. The service was fast and friendly. The food was excellent. For appetizers we had the street tacos with carnitas. They were very tasty. We ordered for our main dish the fajitas for two. We had ours with steak. The steak we very soft and delicious. For desert we had the flan and it was one of the best I've ever had. It was not runny. The atmosphere of the restaurant was pleasant. They have mariachi music playing and that is a nice touch. This was our first visit to this restaurant and it won't be our last. I highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"First time and we will be back!! I had the street tacos, 4 tacos with a large portion of rice and beans amazing.  My husband had a beef taco and tamale both were very good.  Salsa and chips delivered to our table as soon as we sat down and Luis our server was great!  Plus a large draft mug of beer was only $5.25!  They also have a fiesta hour 3pm-6pm with food and drink discounts. Overall great food and service!!"}
{"text":"It's basic though you wouldn't know it from the decor.   I expected a bigger menu. The food was filling from the large portions but plain. The staff was great, attentive and the food came out quickly"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a child. Manuel's is definitely one of my favourite sit-down Mexican restaurants in the valley and their food has always been consistent and tasty. Manuel's also has the best salsa and chips I've ever had, and is really my main draw. I usually go for the cheese enchilada with green sauce and it comes with the chips and salsa, plus a side of rice, and beans with cheese. They also have a carry-out option that I have tried and everything was packaged nicely and came out very quickly. While I'm partial to the Peoria location, the Tempe and Phoenix locations are just as well managed and the food doesn't vary, which is expected. Love it!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place in the area.  Staff is always so nice.  The hot salsa is so much better than the regular, but you have to ask for it."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times and the food has been fairly good but not real consistent. It is obviously a \"turn and burn\" type restaurant and not a true and dedicated Mexican restaurant. If you want fairly consistant and ok food this place will work"}
{"text":"Met a friend of mine that has been coming here for a few years now.  I've passed it a lot, but never had the opportunity to try it.  We were immediately seated and we were greeted by our server, Jake.  We ordered our food, but had a unique circumstance, as I had to leave for a bit to meet some delivery folks at my new home.  He was very accommodating in holding my order until I returned.  Once I returned, my food was served piping hot.  The food was good and beans were real good.  I am very particular about refried beans, and these were well seasoned.  The shredded beef taco was exceptionally good and just stuffed with a lot of meat.  I would definitely return here, especially since it is so convenient in proximity to my home.  I will say, that I am giving this 4 stars because of the service that Jake provided and will ask for him the next time I come here."}
{"text":"Today was day 3 of eating Mexican food but it was great. I was there for lunch and had the chimichanga with carnitas. Absolutely no complaints whatsoever.  Our server Jordan was great, honest, and really knew the menu. I am bothered when you get a server that has no clue about anything, luckily that was not the case. A suggestion when you get the chips and salsa is to ask for the hot salsa, it's great. Thank you to both the server and management for a great experience. Can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"I really like this place they have a good happy hour. Really good Diet Coke with crushed ice. Salsa is always fresh. Lot of really good menu options. But please do not order shrimp fajitas it is only 8 shrimps no rice only beans for $18.95 and I'm still hungry. The menu prices are generally good value. I like the steak  street tacos and cheese enchiladas. Almost always get good service too."}
{"text":"I recommend this place to anyone wanting good flavorful Mexican food. My go to is Carne Picado. Delicious blend of onions peppers jalapenos & tender beef chunks. Have to have the house margarita to pair it with...mmmm good."}
{"text":"The water taste bad.  Give me a Margarita.  ándale The chips are fresh, warm and crisp.  The salsa mild and bordering on sweet.  Other reviews rave about their chips and salsa,  I wonder if those reviewers are seniors that just don't routinely eat spicy food. My Albondiga Soup was okay.  The meatballs had good flavor but we're really firm. The flour tortillas on the side were super hot and the butter I requested on the side was forgotten so I had to ask again. Server brought out some melted yellow stuff that was flavorless and grainy.  I did manage to talk my server into trying again and this time he succeeded in delivering the goods.   So while I'm enjoin my tortilla with montaquia I notice there's an abundance of silk plants all over this place.  Pictures on the wall include photos of what I suspect are menu items.  Subliminal sale perhaps. The dining area is somewhat dark, perhaps to help disguise the excessive decor. Hmm.  Well I need to look away from all of that and focus on my dinner. I will tell you this, the soup I had served wasn't even half as full of stuff as the one I saw pictured on Yelp.  I did take a photo and the difference is obvious. I needed to use my spoon to bring the contents toward the surface.  That other picture shows a bowl heaped FULL of veggies and such.  But even though it lacked in content the flavor was pleasant and filling. We come here maybe once every couple of years and I think with the price of menu items, the dated atmosphere, and the mediocre food that will be more than enough."}
{"text":"over priced for just okay mexican food.  I would compare my 9$ bean and cheese burrito to one at filliberto's...  I was also VERY upset that I paid 2.50 for a side of guacamole. ( IT WAS ONLY 2 ONCES)  Not worth the visit."}
{"text":"The chicken appeared pink in the middle and when this was brought to the waitresses attention she was very kind and went to get the manager. When the manager came over she didn't even greet us or say hello before she immediately started blaming the lighting for the pink look in the chicken. She was extremely rude, never offered to take it back to the kitchen, remake it, substitute it and charged us full price for the meal even though it was not consumed. So I basically paid for a meal that I did not eat not to mention I felt like I was being treated like a common criminal. In addition, I feel it is managements responsibility to back the staff up. The waitress was embarrassed and apologetic. These employees work on tips. When a customer isn't satisfied they don't tip well and this is not right when the wait staff is just the middle man between the kitchen and the customer. Customer satisfaction is the reason businesses thrive so I will assume this location won't be in business for long."}
{"text":"Not as good as the original in Glendale, but still good.  I had the machaca and it almost tasted a little too sweet, or more like Fajitas do... not my favorite taste for machaca anyway, but great chips and salsa and the kids seem to love their food (lots of options for kids)  Everyone else in the group said the place was a solid 3 stars and that they would come back.  Next time I go to this location I think I will just stick with tacos and see how that goes ..."}
{"text":"Very very good salsa - almost as good as my favorite, Los Gringos Locos in Apache Junction.  I enjoyed my dinner here. I was in a very large group and our server was helpful and kept everyone's orders organized. Super yummy mango margaritas, too!"}
{"text":"This place has tasteless food that is over priced. It is not very far from my house and would be easy to stop at but I choose to go to Suzie's, or Poncho's in Phoenix. If you want good Mexican food do your self a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"WOW! What a pleasant surprise to have eaten here! It was better than I expected since it was our first to eat here! The cheese crisper for an appetizer was really good along with the steak and enchilada I ordered for dinner was always very good!! Great service as well from Nicole!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was very little.  It's nothing to knock your socks off, but not bad. I really like the cream cheese style chimis and chicken especial."}
{"text":"We catered a fundraiser with Manuel's mini chimichangas (both beef and chicken) and they were amazing! Super popular snack at our event, and people kept going back for more! Thank you for your support, Manuel's and for the delicious food."}
{"text":"It's very clean, very competent, wildly popular, and probably the best Iowa-Mex southwest of Des Moines.   I drive by it all the time, and the parking lot is regularly packed. It's not a style of food I go looking for. But if you're craving Iowa-Mex this place should scratch your itch."}
{"text":"The service was EXCEPTIONAL!  Nicole at the bar took care of us and we met Melissa who is the manager and she gave us carnitas samples and Nicole sold us on what a deal a skinny margarita is ..best tequila for your buck! ..oh and remember on Mondays they have the best happy hour! Thank you Manuels!! Ill be baaaack!"}
{"text":"Im giving it a very weak two, probably should be a 1. Came in this past Sunday, chips and salsa were alright. Some batches of the salsa were mild, some you took a bite and your mouth was on fire. Wasnt a huge fan of the thin chips that werent fresh. Ordered the Chimichanga plate, and it took almost an hour to get to our table. Beans and rice looked like they had been under the heatlamp for awhile. Not good! The Chimi was medicore at best, the pork inside was dry. I also had a peach margarita which tasted like a Slurpee with no alcohol in it. Dont waste your time and money at this place."}
{"text":"First time here  Good was pretty good and service is friendly. It's an older restaurant and by some standards may be outdated but I personally like it. I think it gives the place charm.  I ordered a tamales with rice and beans. It was plenty of food. My husband got the machaca. He said he liked it."}
{"text":"I have been to Manuels the the last few weeks, and I have to say, I've never had a bad experience.  Nicole is a true professional,  who I've come to love and adore...Margarita Monday's are my favorite !! Highly recommend , the appetizers are great and the Margaritas are the bomb  !! Enjoy !!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 15 years and it just gets better. The 3 amigos dinner, shrimp fajitas,"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst experience I've ever had. Do not get seated on the east side of the restaurant. You will be waiting forever for drinks, chips and food. Slow service and lack of service."}
{"text":"Love this place, old school but food is always consistent and good.  I've been coming here for over 20 years. Salsa is always fresh and Larry will happily bring you the \"hot\" salsa too.  Chips practically melt in your mouth. It's clean and worth the trip, take out available too."}
{"text":"Just moved into my new house in Tempe and am lucky that this little gem is in my backyard. I've been here twice now and so far I've really enjoyed everything I've had. My favorite so far? The spinach enchiladas are YUM YUM YUMMY!!! I ordered the 3 Amigos Sampler feeling least excited about the spinach enchiladas but they were by far my favorite. Next time I might just order those. Also, they have a skinny margarita! Yay for that!"}
{"text":"chips and salsa were great, i ordered a cheese enchilada taco and beans and it was good it wasn't the best i've ever had but good.  The restaurant looks like it could use a face lift.  but overall we had a good experience."}
{"text":"thanks ryan our amazing waiter...the food was hot and delicious and you were so helpful"}
{"text":"This our first time here!!! Delicous:) We got red chili burrito with rice and beans, The shredded beef taco was like mexican grandmother!!! Cheese enchilada and bean tostados were really yummy. Kids got the chicken fingers and fries. Very good overall!! We will come back!!"}
{"text":"First timer. Came in with family. Had a pleasant experience. The server was very attentive. Food was terrific. I felt it was a bit Americanized though. But that won't stop me from coming back. good job folks."}
{"text":"At the behest of my wife, I gave this place a try again and ordered the same thing as last time.  I'm glad she suggested this place again.  The salsa was actually MUCH better this time--actually fairly tasty.  The beef enchiladas were like night and day from the last time, well, maybe night and dawn. . .  Still, a big improvement.  The beans, well, I still didn't like them very much.  The rice was fine.  I can't rave about Manuel's like I used to, but I can't put them down anymore either.  Overall, I'd say that they served me a fairly decent meal--I walked away satisfied.  Nothing special, but I feel like I can go here again for lunch or dinner, and I will again on occasion.  Three and a half stars."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my experience here.  I made an order for carry-out early in the evening last week (8/21/2012).  I ordered two ground beef tacos with just meat and cheese.  I could have made way better tacos at home.  The cheese looked it was shredded and tasted like it was from a package at a grocery store.  The beef was bland and had didn't have much flavor.  The chips for the salsa were stale.  I also ordered a grilled chicken quesadilla with cheese and it was almost $12...way overpriced for the amount and the taste.  I would not recommend this place based on my personal experience here."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Mexican food, certainly not the best around but not bad either.  Service was outstanding, The salsa that comes with the chips is very mild-too mild for me but certainly quaffable.  The Margaritas are pretty good and my wife was happy they had Papago Orange Blossom beer that certainly goes well with Mexican food.  We will return."}
{"text":"Salsa is great tasting. Service  excellent   Had the Fiesta Platter lots of food and great tasting.  Definitely worth stopping at.  Plus the free salsa they give you huge bowls."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Nothing good. Salsa was meh, chips were stale.  Spinach enchilada was just a bunch of spinach stuffed in a tortilla with white sauce on it. Chicken enchiladas had no flavor.  This was our first time here because it's close, we'll make the drive next time to someplace better."}
{"text":"That's one good things about being a restaurant critic or a fact checker! My wife and I believed that mexican food is great in this restaurant . I don't usually don't order other food than Green Corn Tamale. Although, my last try of  Carne Asada was not that good and our recent visit we found out that  both our forks was cleaned well. Still, I will give this restaurant a five star review because of your unsurpassed green corn tamale.  We will be back next time and check those corrections  and will be firm in making the next review. So, always on the look out, Keeps those utensils clean and maintain a standard in your food preparation. We promise we will come and visit again."}
{"text":"So happy they got their liquor license back but wish the bartender/ server knew what a Cadillac or perfect margarita was. Had to order from the margarita menu & buy an extra shot of tequila to offset the strong sweet  sour mix. They have the best smooth/ taco sauce but not provided. Chips were cold like out of a bag. I requested extra garnish with my red chili burro, barely got normal amount but didn't get a chance to ask for more, she dropped food and left quickly and did not see her again until we were done. There were 2 occupied tables, maybe she was busy doing side work. I have been to the other Manuel's locations and the service and food is always great."}
{"text":"I could have been invisible at the bar. Everyone was greet d and told the drink specials while I got \"what would you like?\" Never offered another drink, never thanked for coming in, never a word other than my tab was in front of me. Won't be back. I can get ignored other places."}
{"text":"After moving from Scottsdale to Mesa, our family had to find a new \"local\" Mexican spot. We stumbled into Manuel's on Christmas Eve in 2012 and we've been coming back since. We like sitting in the bar area since we have a toddler that can get a little noisy (and the bar masks the noise a little better). I LOVE the salsa. Prices are fair, portions are perfect. My go-to item is the chicken taco salad, which has tons of fresh cool crunch."}
{"text":"This was very good! I enjoyed the food and my little girl had the tacos and she ate everything!"}
{"text":"The food was great, well what little bit of that there was, and our server was on point with refills and checking in on us.  The wife and I ordered the fajitas for 2 and they were great, but they seriously had like ten pounds of vegetables on them and had hardly any meat.  Did not like paying close to $40 dollars to leave hungry when even Chili's offers more meat on their fajitas."}
{"text":"Was really in the mood for soup. What better place to get soup frm then a Mexican restaurant. I called my order in. Girl on the phone was very nice. She said it would be about 10 to 15min befor it was ready and they would call onces it was.   I live right down the road so i was waiting on there call so i wouldn't have to wait the whole time. About 20min past bye and no call so i drove down there. Onces i got there i was greated my three friendly young ladies. My soup was already ready.They even through in some chips and salsa.    I ordered the ablondigas (meat ball soup) it had carrots, celery, rice, tomatoes in a delicious broth. The soup was nice and chunky. The veggies and rice were cooked to Perfection nice and soft (falling apart). The meet balls were decent sized but lacked flavor. The broth made up for it though nice and savory. I put my own seasoning on everything but with how good the broth was there was no need.   The tortillas did not last  authentic at all and one of them had a weired black spot on it. The salsa was ok very chunky, sweet and fresh tasting. I'm not a fan of sweet salsa my self but if you are you would love it my friend tryed it and loved it. I would come back but would definitely try something different for tortilla soup sounds really good."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite mexican food place. Their fajitas are amazing and I always have a hard time wanting to try anything else on the menu. I love sitting in the bar area and they have delicious complimentary chips, salsa, and bean dip.... yum!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day with a Groupon.  The staff as well as the chips and salsa were great.  The food was super.  The lunch deal included the entree as well as beans and rice and the portion was more than substantial.  The server (Carlos, I think) was super polite, very efficient and explained  what was contained in each item we ordered. A great Mexican place in this part of town."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place.  I love their food.  My fav is the shredded beef chimi and carnitas:). The food is always on point here.  Their flan is to die for."}
{"text":"This is my pick for quick, cheap Mexican food. Sure, there are better places, but this works when I'm in a hurry."}
{"text":"We had a family dinner here tonight.  Excellent service by Dennis.  Great food.  We will be back. Nice and quiet place for dinner."}
{"text":"Pros: chips and salsa. tasty and plentiful.   Cons: Food took forever to come out, and came out wrong. Mediocre taste. Pay attention to your bill.... we had about $15 of extra charges added to our bill that were incorrect. Waiter was unapologetic about the whole thing.   We won't return!"}
{"text":"Love their ala-carte taco's and their salsa. We eat here quite often. The prices are decent but sometimes the service is a little slow. Pretty hit or miss. But with that being said, we really enjoy the food and drinks."}
{"text":"I went here the other day for lunch and it was very disappointing. I have been to other Manuel's locations and they have been alright, but this one was not very good. I went for lunch and got the pollo especial which is basically a chimichanga with jalapeno cream cheese sauce on it. It was pretty gross, the chicken tasted like dish water and there was barely any of the jalapeno sauce on it. Also, it was really soggy, not crispy at all. I did give an extra star because our server was really nice and attentive, however, I would not come here again when there are places like top shelf that make the same dish much better."}
{"text":"Great food...great drinks...everything was perfect, our server and buser were the best we have had in a long time. Food was cooked perfect and everyone was friendly."}
{"text":"I can't say much about the service because I ordered take out. It was ready in the time frame they promised. When I got home it needed a little warming in the microwave. I had to put it on a regular plate because it came in an aluminum pan. I ordered a beef chimichanga. I was expecting more than just meat inside. The shredded beef was juicy and tender, but lacked much flavor. It came with sides of rice, beans, chips, and salsa. I thought this meal was just average Mexican food. If I go back, next time I will try a different menu item."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for a few years. It's usually pretty good. The last few times I have been here I have sat at the bar and Nicole has been my bartender. She is delightful. She always has a smile and a good attitude and is on top of getting my order and making sure I always have a full drink. The experience is always better when she is here. I don't think I would come back if she wasn't here. Thanks for the great service Nicole."}
{"text":"Manuel's is so good. It's one of our favorite restaurants and I have withdrawal if I don't eat there often enough.  My favorites are their chips and salsa and the chicken fajitas. The best part about this place though is Luis. We now request him every time we go in. Even if it's been quite a while, he remembers us and our order (call me predictable)... Besides, the fajitas are so good, I can't bring myself to get anything else."}
{"text":"Manuels was very disappointing.  I ordered taquitos, and it tasted like they were the frozen and just warmed in the oven.  I could bought the same ones at the local grocery store.  Same can be said with the salsa.  It tasted like jar salsa.  It should have been obvious from the lack of cars in the parking lot, on a Friday evening.  The 80's music also did not  fit the atmosphere of a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Rude hostess. Literally left and went somewhere else because of attitude and eye rolling."}
{"text":"Mexican pizza is awesome and warm chips and salsa are the best! But what I really come here for is their green corn tamale! Really great!"}
{"text":"I didn't know where to go for dinner with my friend who was coming over since I wanted to hangout with her and I was in town. I was searching and reading reviews about different places in Tempe. I came across this place and suggested it to my friend.  Service: We were greeted with care and compassion by the hostess to our table  Chips and Salsa: Very awesome! My friend asked for the spicy salsa and the chips tasted better with it.  Meal: Overall I have to say that the meal I order was really good.   Rating: 5/5  I will most likely come to this place again :)"}
{"text":"Great Mexican Food, I had 2 tacos w rice and beans yum. My friend had a chimi. We both loved our food and it was nice that they kept the food traditional. They have have great guacamole. The service was friendly and they did a good job. You can tell they appreciate your business."}
