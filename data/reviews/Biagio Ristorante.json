{"text":"Please do not eat here. They are the rudest people I have ever met. I just wanted to make a simple reservation and before I knew it I was getting screamed at for no reason. I would stay away if I were you. Consider yourselves warned."}
{"text":"Biagio is an elegant restaurant that was a great place for a group dinner. Our waiter, Tony, was great and very attentive.  He even shared a recipe for a grilling sauce he likes to make for seafood with me.  I had the tiger shrimp stuffed with crab meat and wrapped in pancetta.  The shrimp was cooked just enough and incredibly tasty.  I had an ice cream desert that had fruit in it that was absolutely wonderful.  It was just a perfect ending to a great meal.  A couple of people had the veal osso buco and enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Having just visited Rome and was currently visiting Toronto, I found Biagio to be a pleasant surprise.  [1] Not too haughty to take a few walk-in's. Always good when your restaurant has humility.  [2] good service  [3] good food - seafood, lobster, fish, and wine.  nice setting too / location / furniture. We'd go back!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite Italian restaurant! Although a bit pricy, you pay for what you get and it is well worth it. The service is always impeccable and the food tastes very authentic! Love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Will not go here again. Together with a few couples we did the Winterlicious menu. I had the mussels, veal and chocolate mousse. In my opinion the presentation was great, but then the actual taste was mediocre. Nothing that made me say \"oooh now that is good\". The evening was great, with average service........ until the end.  We were with a few other couples and we asked for separate checks. The waiter said flat out \"that's not possible, we don't do separate checks\" (Which they did not say at the beginning or anywhere on the menu). We told him that we are all paying by credit and so its going to somehow have to be divided. He told us he isn't a calculator and he can't figure it out. Then he made the excuse that the bottle of wine we got couldn't be divided and so my boyfriend and I said to put it onto our tab. He finally agreed with a great amount of grumbling and informing us that \"we should have told him\" we wanted separate checks.... should he not haev asked us? I have been to lower end restaurants like Jack Astors and they ask you all the time. General rule of tipping in Canada is roughly 15% before tax, which is what my boyfriend and I do for average service. If we have horrible service, we do 10% and if we have great-superb service we tip 20-25%. So generally we tip 13% AFTER tax at average places because it works out till about 14.7%. After handing back my boyfriends creditcard the waiter rudely said to him in front of everyone else \"You are supposed to tip 15%\". EXCUSE ME? First of all, we essentially did because its 15% before tax, second of all, are you REALLY saying in front of everyone that you should be getting a better tip? We confronted him about this and he become angry and annoyed saying that people are supposed to tip 15% in Canada and he has a right to ask for it. We explained to him that it was 15% before taxes but he kept arguing. We asked to talk to the manager. Who came and was VERY defensive and said its mandatory to give a tip and his waiters deserve to be tipped well because they only get paid 9.50 an hour. I mentioned that the service was worthy of the tip we gave and that the food was only average. He actually scoffed at me and said that I was ridiculous. Then he went on to say \"Do whatever you want, I don't care about a few dollars anyway\". All of us were so surprised by his attitude and the horrible service at a place that is supposed to be considered fine dining. Its really not worth the food to be treated like that by the staff."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for dinner in February 2016. I would give food a 4 star but service is hardly for 3. The restaurant was almost empty (5 tables only) and the servers (2 of them) did not bother look at the table passing by. Dirty dishes waited to be taken. I tried to look at the server but he passed by and did not even look. No water refills until asked. And even after asked the server with water will go first to the other table passing your empty glass (I guess because they ordered an expensive bottle of wine and I only took a glass). And I could not believe my eyes when I noticed that the water glass was chipped like in a fast food restaurant. Service was extremely slow but when I was paying the server was watching me standing behind my back which made me feel uncomfortable. I would like to mention uncomfortable chairs so if you want your back comfortable think twice."}
{"text":"Very bad attitude from a waiter at the entrance. The place was almost empty compared to the two almost full restaurants 40 feet down the same street. We left."}
{"text":"Biagio's is definitely on the pricey end, but I enjoyed my experience.  The weather was perfect for dining on their cozy patio, which is set in just enough from the street.  While travelling to and from the patio, I noticed the beautiful architectural details of the building, which we later found out is a historic building that still belongs to the city.  I ordered the orecchiette for my main course, which I cannot complain about, but the other pastas I tried that evening were much better in comparison.  There is a quite a variety to choose from, so be adventurous in your selection.  The highlight of my meal - dessert of course.  Biagio has his very own version of cheesecake, which is a light creamy/cheesy filling wrapped in a puff pastry shell served with fresh berries and sauces.  I recommend you get an entire order for yourself, don't share!  Paired with my cappuccino, it was the perfect way to end a lovely evening.  Be warned: they close early, even on weekends.  Also, they occasionally lock their doors even earlier for security reasons, so call ahead if possible."}
{"text":"Exceptional.Delicious authentic Italian food at Fair prices. Quiet and professional atmosphere. Charming owner operated. You will not be disappointed. Fine dining. Dress up bc its in a beautiful old building and you will feel like a special guest with Mr. Biagio."}
{"text":"I went to Biagio on a tuesday night. The dining room was dead but there was a huge party in the back room(wedding?). It seems to be a family run business. The food was fabulous. The decor was blah.  Food: Carpaccio- yummy Caprese salal-real buffalo mozzeralla Ravioli- 3.5/5 lacking flavor Lamb- amazing"}
{"text":"Biagio's is one of the finsest Italian Restaurants in Canada.  The food is spectacular and the wine list is breathtaking.  Biagio's also has one of the greatest private patios in Toronto - great for al fresco dining"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food with impeccable service in one of my favourite neighbourhoods. Great for date nice , a family dibber or celebration. You can also reserve the wine cellar for a private meal. Loved every bit of my food and I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"The environment is nice - they do have a beautiful patio in the summer including a fountain. Nice touch.   The food, however, is mediocre at best. Portions are tiny as well, and overpriced. Poor value for what you get."}
{"text":"Highly Recommend Biagio.  This restaurant has to serve the BEST food in the city. It's my husband and i's absolute favorite. We hosted a small celebration here for about 50 ppl and everyone is still raving about how spectacular the food. We tried a solid portion of the menu and everything was fresh and cooked to perfection. Biagio even recommend a wine to pair our food with, which was also delish. We cannot wait to go back and we highly recommend this restaurant to all of our friends."}
{"text":"went here for Summerlicious with a friend and we are both very satisfied. I had sea food salad, pasta and tiramisu. we were expecting the salad as normal salad with bit of sea food but turned out to be ALL sea food and it was very delicious. the bread that came with it were also chewy and good. the entree was in a nice portion and all three courses were very tasty. we sat in the patio, where has a lovely view and is quiet. trees gave us good shade so even it was a hot day, we still felt comfortable sitting outdoors. the waiter was very nice as well. in all we felt satisfied and happy having lunch here and would love to come again for another summerlicious treat as well as their regular menu:)"}
{"text":"Amazing and real quality food. Classic, traditional and delicious. Must try the calamari and whatever wine the waiter recommends. They know their stuff. Bread and olive oil is the best opener with a glass of wine."}
{"text":"First time at this beautiful restaurant and it will not be my last time. The decor, the ambience and the food and the service is 5 STAR. I had the jumb shrimp stuffed with crab and my son had the Osso Bucco and both were to die for. This was a special birthday for me and they made it even more special. We will be coming back and I'll be telling everyone I know to go there."}
{"text":"One of the finest restaurants in the city, Biagio boasts a palatial decor staffed with some of the most charming, warm, and finely dressed servers that I've had pleasure of enjoying.  Even before we found ourselves at our table, I knew our evening was going to be exquisite, sensual, and fun.  Tempting as it was to try their pasta varieties served with veal or lamb, it was a seafood night for us.  The coil of sliced tuna and salmon served in cream sauce made for a bold appetizer alongside the lobster bisque that we shared.  It featured a robust aftertaste like crushed nuts that contrasted nicely to its initial smoothness.  My jumbo crab-stuffed, pancetta-wrapped shrimp was to die for, and even the slices of gold potato served beside it felt like silk across the palate.    Her shrimp in garlic herb orrecchiette was brazen and very green in flavour, alerting the senses and very worthy of the romance novel of a wine list offered here.  I'm nitpicking, but I would have been happier if our dirty martinis (which were otherwise excellent) were served with pitted olives, or if the breadbasket's treats were warm and served with butter.  But even that amount of poking seems ludicrous when all else is so flawless."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant! I came here with a coworker during a business conference. The ambiance was beautiful, food was perfect & we had exceptional service. Will certainly be coming back here when I am in town again."}
{"text":"The restaurant is stunning - very clean & Victorian inside. I think this would be the perfect place to have a wedding reception. Also, the patio looks cozy & nice.  I came here for summerlicious but didn't like the options so ended up getting the fungi risotto. It was a bit bland. Portion sizes are big. My friend got a gnocchi and I tried some, it was seriously really good! I would recommend getting that if you love pasta - so soft, chewy, and creamy."}
{"text":"Went to Biagio on a Groupon (that's how we try out new places).  Was a $102 groupon so was expecting great things.  At first it was noisy as there was a corporate event in the bigger room (when the doors were closed it was much better.  First thing I noticed on the wine menu was the very high prices for a glass of wine.  THey had half and full bottles as well.  Usually expect to pay 8-12 for a glass.  Here it was 18-25 for a 6 oz glass!  So wasn't convinced at first.  The food, on the other hand, was exceptional, with creative specials and a wide variety of regular options.  The rack of lamb was one of the best I have had.  Was New Zealand lamb which was on pare with the Northern Quebec rack I had at Mt Tremblant this past summer.  The cheesecake dessert wrapped in phillo pastry was amazing.  My dinner partner eat it up (was warm and melting inside.  A good experience.  A nice place for a special dinner, especially if you like good wine.  An exceptional wine list to say the least.  Hope to go back one day."}
{"text":"Great Italian. Fresh made pasta was served al Dante  and the porcini cream sauce, delicious.  Filet beef was well cooked, juicy and had a wonderful sauce.  Service was very good - prompt and helpful."}
{"text":"Went for a Summerlicious lunch. Seafood salad, gnocchi in tomato sauce and pesto, two scoops of ice cream. Everything was delicious and portions were generous. A glass of wine was reasonable and large and went well with the meal. Authentic, quality Italian food, good wine selection, great atmosphere - it looked nice inside but I opted for the patio and could hear the fountain. Great place for a special occasion, to spoil yourself or just to have a well prepared meal. I hope to be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Beautiful space and patio. Right in my neighborhood. I really want to like this place. But it's just a little bit of a meh to me. The menu is extensive but traditional (not innovative) which is fine. And they do their traditional things well. I got the lamb chops and house slalad from the lunch menu while my bf ordered from the summerlicious menu. He's happy with the veal he got but he's in general happy with any cooked meat. He was really happy with the tiramisu. I liked how the lamb chop was cooked too, tender and nicely seasoned. But it comes with string beans and a big piece of carrot. I don't know, what's next, some mashed patato and gravy? Just not my type of thing. The waitor was nice, though. If you are into old school this could be a 4 star but not for me."}
{"text":"It doesn't get more authentic than this place. I got the full experience with an Italian server who had a love for food and wine, and a passion for customer experiences. The food was exceptional, high-quality and immaculately prepared.   If you're looking for a trendy/casual/hip spot, this is not the place. The tables are dressed in white tablecloths, the waiters are in suits, and it's typically pretty quiet in here. It's also not cheap. For a group of 5, I paid just over $600 (two bottles of wine, an abundance of food, and a generous tip included).   Overall, I highly recommend this place for quality, authentic food and drinks. This is my go-to if i'm entertaining my (very picky and particular) parents, who don't love the noise of the city and the modern elements of my otherwise favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"Classy ristorante on King St E. Enclosed in historic old town hall, Biagio has a really open and inviting dining room that would be great for a large party. I enjoyed the lobster bisque and a vegetarian pesto ravioli; both polished off in seconds. A bit pricey, but I'd recommend it. Biagio himself came to check up on us, and treated us well. The patio is a knockout. Secluded, tree-laden, plenty of shade and HUGE!  Obligatory Title Pun: What do you know, GIO?  Menu Readability: Leatherbound and gallant.  Need to mention: This place seems to close (very) early.  What this place teaches me about myself: I need to further explore King street east."}
{"text":"The pasta is amazing. Matriciana pasta is not on the menu, but ask for it. Out of this world.  Ask for Mr. Biagio, he will help you order. He is the owner and a great guy."}
{"text":"I find that their food is good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Personally, it's not my favourite atmosphere, that said, can be good for large groups / events in the back, as you can book a private room that's quite spacious. The service is always great, with knowledgeable and responsive servers."}
