{"text":"So this was my friday lunch stop with a few coworkers and i was kinda skeptical because there was only 2 reviews and both were 5 stars.  We were greeted when we walked in and seated are selves, the bar tender who was the only one working up front came and got are drink orders and gave us menus.  Drinks came out quick just soda and water since we had to go back to work, we ordered are food. I got an order of fries pickles and the steak philly, mu coworkers ordered wing and the other ordered the cheese ball burger and homemade pizza rolls.  This is where thing started going south, we ordered are food at 2:30ish and did not get it till 3:05 which usually an hr lunch gives us plenty of time for a sit down lunch.  I got my fried pickles first which were nicely crispy and well battered but they were very very very greasy and served with buffalo ranch which i did not enjoy because it is tangy vinegary pickles with vinegary buffalo ranch was not a good combo regular ranch would be just fine.  My coworkers pizza rolls looked amazing and he said they were amazing.  As far as my philly cheese steak it was sub par,  the roll was very nice there was not much in the way of peppers onions or mushrooms, the meat was super greasy and over salted oh and i could not find the garlic mayo.  On a plus side the frys were great and i could have eaten a whole plate of them.  My coworker that got the burger said it was very good and cooked to his order, the one who got the wing was very disappointed said the mild sauce had no flavor at all and the garlic parm only tasted like parm.  Overall service was good, the kitchen brings this place down.  If the food was prepared a touch faster and some more attention to seasoning and letting grease drain off some of the fried food it would be much better.  This was not a great experience but i will give them another try in the future to see if i can up the rating."}

{"text":"A bunch of friends and I found this place during a random weekend bar crawl through cities we were too familiar with. Out of all the places we went to this by far was our favorite one. (We have been back 3 times since original going lol). The specials here are good and the food here is surprisingly good. Below is the a picture of a chicken philly, I would like to think of someone who has had enough chicken philly's in my life to be a expect. So in my expert opinion it was really good for a late night bar food. But what makes this place good is the service! Jesse who is a bartender there made a lasting impression that made myself and friends come back not only to Kate's but to see him. So if you're ever in the area stop by and tell Jesse hello and I sent you!"}
