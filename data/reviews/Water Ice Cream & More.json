{"text":"Great local ice cream shop if you are looking for a quick scoop. Many flavors of ice cream to goose from but none that are super off the wall. The man that works behind the counter is SO nice and was a pleasure to talk with. Would definitely go back again if in the area."}
{"text":"So good! I had a brownie sundae w/ stawberries & whipped creme!! Next time I'm coming back for the strawberry shortcake! The people that own this shop are so nice, and definitely go the extra mile! I really hope their shop does well!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream here ! They have lots of different flavors my favorite is the coconut pineapple !! Very inexpensive ice cream I bring my kids here all the time. Good customer service is a plus"}
{"text":"I decided to save money and stop on in, which was a smart decision because the selection is huge and tasty. Good bye Cold Stone! The prices are very affordable and convenient. The owner is very friendly and seems to care about his customers. I am already a returning customer, but I would definitely recommend this shop."}
{"text":"great ice cream selection, but an even greater staff :) very welcoming, friendly, and clean environment."}
{"text":"My office gets its bottled water from Water Ice Cream and More. Very friendly staff.  Lots of delicious ice cream and snacks."}
{"text":"No surprises here, they sell water and ice cream! That's two perfect ways to stay cool when it's 100+ degrees outside. 3 gallon water containers were inexpensive and filling them up was also no problem. The ice cream is Thrifty brand and they have a lot of good flavors. They also have a frequent customer card that you can build up for every 5 gallons you fill at one time. The water itself tasted good, it had a neutral flavor with no aftertaste or chemical taste. Service was fast and friendly."}
