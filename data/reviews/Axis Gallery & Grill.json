{"text":"I'm love this place on the weekends for brunch.  Came across it by accident, excellent value, great brunch and great wait staff. I'm there every weekend one day or the other."}
{"text":"Found it overpriced food is mediocre overcooked not worth the price pints 7$+ only patio in the junction i think thats why it gets so busy lacks atmosphere. live music is an open mic night where anyone i mean anyone is allowed to play until they are cut off."}
{"text":"Went there about a month ago for lunch, the patio was packed and of course had no choice but to sit inside.  Ordered an Iced Tea & an Axis Club. The food was great BUT unfortunately the table service sucked!!!   Would I go back to Axis,,,,,,NO   Great service is essential & without great service what's the point of going there!"}
{"text":"I went here for sunday brunch.  we went specifically because there is sometimes live jazz, but unfortunately the performer was not there that day/doesn't play on sundays, etc.  the restaurant was surprisingly quiet for a sunday brunch and there was soccer playing on the widescreen tv's on the walls.  the interior looks pretty nice.  the brunch menu is pretty small, but it has all the expected dishes such as eggs benedict, 'traditional' breakfast and omelettes.  the coffee is really good, and refills are free.  i had the omlette du jour; a vegetable medley.  the omelette was really good, there was a lot of cheese, and chopped vegetables.  however, i would say there was too much onion, the pieces of onion were too big and awkward to eat, and the omelette was HUGE!  it says its a 3 egg omelette, but it has to be at least 5.  With it, came some over-heated, dried out potatoes and a generous portion of salad mix and also fruit slices. i enjoyed it, but it could use some fine-tuning, i.e. better mixed vegetables and cheese inside, less eggs, more potatoes and fresher tasting ones.  the egg omlette by itself was really good - very fluffy and well cooked.  The people i was with thought the prices were pretty steep for a pretty mediocre bacon and eggs breakfast (8-12$) but everyone enjoyed their food.  The service was very good and the server clearly was experienced and had a good memory.  The bathrooms are clean, and in the basement.  The last thing i would say is that it is unfortunate that they only have one large size of take-away container, which is styrofoam.  Overall, a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"One of the go-to meeting places for friends in the hood. The patio is great in the summer. Friendly staff, good live music, and the weekly specials...martinis, happy hour menu, etc!"}
{"text":"Went in and sat down.  waited approximately 20 minutes for a server to come give me a menu or ask me for a drink.  ordered breakfast.  omelette came.  first thing i noticed was that the potatoes were cold.  not warm.  completely cold.  stone cold.  the omelette was hot though, so i started eating.  the ham was cut in these strange cubes and then i realized that they are using cold cut ham.  the salad was dripping in dressing. way too much dressing. the toast- stone cold.  again- not warm.  completely cold and slathered in butter.   i put the cold potatoes and toast to the side and concentrated on the food cooked for my plate.  immediately having finished the food (with the exception of the potatoes and toast that were clearly cooked before i ordered) my stomach started to hurt.  its still hurting as i write this.  i think it has to do with the level of grease in the omelette or maybe the oil they cook the food with.   i am actually having diarrhea as i write this (approximately half an hour after finishing the food).  what can i say?  i tried to email the administration through the website to let them know what an awful breakfast they served me but no such website or email address is listed.  the meal was relatively cheap for the area, $9 total for the omelette special.  the thing is- i would have rather had the tasteless starbucks breakfast sandwich for $5 that doesnt make me feel sick and isnt full of oil and grease.  thanks axis for ruining my appetite for the day.   i still tipped my waitress (that's a thankless job) and i never asked for them to comp the meal but that meal shouldn't have happened.  breakfast like that is an embarrasment to breakfast itself. blech!"}
{"text":"Meh. I'd give two stars, but the patio is pretty great and our visit was on a warm summer evening. We shared two pounds of wings, which were a bit dry and overcooked. I would have asked for extra sauce but we saw no sign of a server until the wings were almost gone. My boyfriend had a coke (watery) and I had a pint of tankhouse (the only thing close to local or micro). Servers were friendly enough, but pretty absent. It's worth a visit if you're in the area and want to sit outside, but don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"Axis is a good place for both brunch and after-work drinks. The food is reliably good and the staff are always friendly. The biggest drawbacks are that the bathrooms are perpetually smelly, and that sometimes the live music can be loud and distracting. If you like random live acts though, they could be a plus."}
{"text":"Get the steak and argula sandwich! Service here is nice. Happy to have this joint in the junction."}
{"text":"Axis has one of the best patios in the Junction and serves a mighty fine sirloin burger. It can get a bit pricey for what is essentially better-than-average pub fare, however--at least on a student budget. The beer selection is good and the service, although it can be somewhat inconsistent depending on when you go, is usually decent. Sometimes there is good music or entertainment taking place and the ambiance is always nice with a rotating selection of art on the walls. I'm a regular."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this place, especially since everyone else seems to love it-but every time I go there, it's a huge disappointment.  I'll start by saying that I get a weird vibe.  I know that's not concrete, but it truly feels like the staff don't want you there.  I've been half a dozen times and never walked away feeling like I was treated well.  I happened by there last night against my better judgement, mainly because we ran out of beer and it's right down the street from my house.  The bartender was nice.  I will say that.  The server however was chalk full of attitude.  I asked if our presence there was keeping her from being cut.  She gave a snarky reply.  Then her boyfriend showed up, and they made out at the bar, which normally I wouldn't care about, but every time I went in to use the facilities or get another round, they stopped long enough to give me cut-eye, and it really pissed me off.  The professional bartender was brought down by a crappy young server who doesn't yet know what a bad job is but mostly, the bartenders aren't very nice either.  Try at your own risk.  Me?  I'm done."}
{"text":"Both of our previous visits were meant to be pit stops, but the quality of their foods and martinis has made us stay for the whole night.  Oddly, for their $3.99 martini night they have no martini menu but it's a blessing in disguise.  My boyfriend shoke up his iphone app at random and the bartender made us EVERYTHING the iphone showed, to perfection.  Sweet aroma from fresh coffee beans in the Expresso Martini, the subtly spicey Bourbon Silk, Lychee Mango... we end up totaling 9 martinis on top of the pitcher.  The bartender doesn't make girly drinks though; the fruity drinks taste great (no bitterness at all) but doesn't have much sugar drenched in it.  Oh yes! the food!  A $5 French Onion soup is surprisingly delicious and plentiful.  Salads are light on greasy dressing in a health-conscious way, and their spring rolls are good.  We have yet to expand beyond finger foods but we'll try some soon, now that my friend has officially decided to switch her office party over to this place from a College St. option.  The ambience is great and it's so close to Bathurst subway station.  The place is relaxing but CLEAN: No more bar dives!  It doesn't look like a breakfast joint: the biggest item on their menu is that bar sitting in the center of the restaurant.  I don't think I'd go for breakfast here unless it's hangover Sunday.  There are TVs around the bar for the sports fans but not as many as Hoops (where they have a flat screen TV at every single table)...good for me, but if you want to yell at a projector on superbowl Sundays, you should go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had a burger and onion rings here for dinner the other night.  Can't vouch for the whole menu, just for what I had.  They have a fairly decent draught menu but it'd dominated more by the national and int'l plonk brands rather than micro breweries.  So, I had the burger. For $10 it's not a bad deal. It comes with fries or onion rings too, so, I guess you'd say, good value.  They make their own patties too, which is a plus.  I was told however, rather emphatically, they only serve burgers well done. I guess I should have just passed then. Indeed, I got a well done burger which meant it was semi burnt and dry and still sitting in my tummy! Wouldn't have this again. The onion rings are ok. Not great, not like Licks onion rings, just standard industrial frozen onion rings. If they just didn't cook the burger to much they'd probably have a much better review.  Doesn't seem to be many pubs in the junction so this may be your only choice for now. I was disappointed. I wouldn't have a burger here again. Even if I paid more, a burger is something you have a craving for, and if it's wrong or off or not done right, then the whole experience and craving is kaput! Like going to a bad movie, you walk out thinking you just wasted two hours and you feel completely unsated. That's how I felt leaving this pub, although I also felt a bit nauseous."}
{"text":"Ahh, good 'ol Axis. This is definitely our go to pub in the Junction. The side patio is great in the Summer for people watching and just hanging out. The live band at night is always a nice touch.   Every time we've been there we've had good service. It's just nice to be able to come to a bar and feel relaxed. The place is clean and staff is friendly.  Now, if you come to Axis and don't order the fries, you are doing yourself a great disservice. They are great. A mix of potato and sweet potato fries that will keep you eating until they're finished. I've dubbed them crack fries and we order them every single time!  Prices are reasonable too so next time you're in the Junction, stop in here."}
{"text":"The service is pleasant, although we felt the lone server was overwhelmed by the large number of people in for lunch.  My husband had the Salmon burger with fries and I had the vegetarian Quesadillas.  He loved the Salmonburger and was really thrilled with the fries. I tried a couple and was convinced they are the best fries ever.  My Quesadilla was perfect.  I even  had some left over to take home. A very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"we were looking for a place with a patio that would be open in the junction area on sunday after 4pm (for some funny reason most of the places start to close in this area exactly at 4pm)  not only we found one but we also very much liked it.  the service was very friendly and attentive.  the beer menu is pretty big.  there is a screen inside where they were showing olympics closing ceremonies.  the best is the menu. the burgers are yummy and so the fries. but the veg bbq tofu burger is superb! great sauce and caramelized onions such a rarity in veg burgers! really enjoyed the place!"}
{"text":"Myself and 2 of my friends recently went here and I have to say the experience was awkward to say the least. It was my first time here and we went on a Monday evening for a bite to eat. The servers spent the entire time flirting with the guys at the bar and came over once to take our order and then came back and put the food on the table and walked away, I was trying the entire time to get her attention so I could get a drink. Anything would be nice... Even a water? But no. I felt like I was on an episode of restaurant makeover. The place it's self was very nice and the food was good and came fast I just wish the service was better and little more friendly as the server made our time there feel very uncomfortable, almost as if we had just walked into some intimate private party. Maybe it was just the day though? Who knows."}
{"text":"Came to see a friend play, started with calamari, it was greasy and rubbery...not impressed, gonna try the fish cakes...wish me luck!"}
{"text":"Walked in. Sat down. Tried to hail two waitresses. Got ignored. Just for fun I waited to see how long. 10 minutes. No acknowledgement at all. Left. Now eating Sushi on the corner of Dundas and Keele. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVED my experience here at Axis!  D and I went for dinner & drinks here with my Daddio a couple nights ago and had a wonderful time!  We left around 9:15 p.m. and the band had just begun to set up. Seemed like it was going to be a bumpin' night! And it was a Tuesday... NICE!  We had the bruschetta appetizer (sans pesto, of course - they were more than happy to accommodate my SEVERE nut allergy and omit the requisite \"drizzle\" of pesto) as well as the crab cakes and the Caesar salad. ALL were DELIGHTFUL.   D ordered the sirloin burger and added cheddar & bacon. It came with fries & onion rings. The onion rings were INSANE GOOD. So it's been a while since I had an onion ring, but DAMN those were FANTASTIC!!! The fries were great as well, and D said the burger was \"OH.... it was AMAZING\". Yeah. Daddio ordered the \"big boy\" steak (10 oz.) and substituted extra vegetables for the potatoes. NO PROB to make the change! Also, he asked for his steak to be done \"Chicago-style\", which is not something all chefs can do to perfection. It is charred on the outside, to order on the inside... and my Dad wanted it medium-medium-rare inside. THAT IS HARD. They did it to perfection! I chose the veggie quesadillas, but I was torn between a few veg-friendly options! (YAY!) All was fantastic. My quesas were FAB. Everyone loved their food. The apps were particularly wonderful. MMMMMM!!!  I would love to try this place in the summer for its extensive patio area!  The bartender was also GREAT! One drawback for the boys was that they only have one kind of tequila, and unfortunately it's Jose Cuervo. That aside, the bartender served wonderful drinks, and we drank many.  VERY cool find in our 'hood that we'll be returning to often!"}
{"text":"Axis is a weird bird.  I've been going there on and off since 2000 (wow I'm old) and it's always held a special place in my heart, mainly because of the friendly staff and the great times I had with friends there during a formative part of my life.  Lately I've started going back since I now live in the area again.  And it's still good. We go often. But when you have to put on your Yelp hat and become a critic, it's hard to really give it high marks.  The food is a mixed bag. It's pub grub, sometimes surprisingly good, sometimes kinda bland. I tend to stick to some favorites and never go wrong (Grill Veggie Wrap + Sweet Potato fries +  Bloody Ceaser = good times, every time).  Brunch is decent. Patio is nice sized. The atmosphere is casual and fun.  But the service is pretty sloppy sometimes these days. The waitresses can be a lot of fun, but fun doesn't always mean reliable. And often doesn't.  It's just nothing stand out, but for some reason I always go back. Just something about it feels like home, in a way, and I never regret it when all is said and done.  take that for what you will."}
{"text":"Went to check out a friend's band - it's a bit of a haul for us to get there, so it's not a regular hangout. But oh my - if we were closer, we'd totally be there.  Typical noisy/crowded. I'm not good in crowds, but was actually fairly comfortable - and even moreso when the bartender (I think one of the owners) made my first Hendrick's martini.  Oh - it was awesome.  (Sometimes you go someplace and they say they can make a martini but it's 'meh', but this place?  Spot on!)  We finally got a table ('please seat yourself'  eeeek!) and ordered a bunch of appies and a bottle of wine.  Seriously: *BEST* Sweet potato fries ever!  nom nom nom  We're definitely partial because were there meeting people we know, but seriously: awesome place. A bit of a cluster_____ with the milling about creeping tables for a place to sit...and the service is a bit, erm...'casual'.  If you can hang with that, you're in for an awesome time!  Srsly"}
{"text":"Our experience was probably affected by what seemed to be an under staffed situation. There was a 30-40 minute wait for the food, and the plates were did not come together, with a 5-7 minute wait for the last. The some of the food (the eggs and bacon) was also undercooked. Also some problems with dirty glasses and tables. The food is pretty standard though, and fairly cheap actually. If your just looking for a simple breakfast, this might be your place."}
{"text":"Not a bad patio for this part of the city. I don't often frequent the area so was looking forward to checking out a local bar. There wasn't anything overltly unique but just a casual place to grab a drink. Service was good and was very happy with the bruschetta. I must say however that in an interesting surprise, the sticky toffee pudding was amazing!! Would come back for just that if the opportunity presented itself."}
{"text":"Axis is a good place for a beer or maybe a meal in the Junction.  Axis is basically a local men's sports bar that would love to broaden its appeal to women and hipsters with the name \"Gallery and Grill\" affixed. FYI- On my visit, there were about 25 people inside. Two were women.  They have about 10 beers on draught, as well as a full menu similar to a pub menu.  The service here is good, and the beer is cold. They do have a nice patio that faces west.  Axis needs a bit of an update. The interior is dark and tired. On my recent visit the art on the wall looked like paper drawings from local school kids. They could also refrain from putting so many posters on the entryway glass.  Axis has a strong local sports bar appeal. Perhaps they would be better served to invest in and develop this theme.  If you are looking for a locals only crowd that skews older where you can get pub food, beer, and watch a game, The Axis may be your place."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio. 16 oz Steamwhistle for $5 with tax Saturday night special! The shrimp vindaloo was awesome with saffron rice, naan, yogurt and samosa included for $15, decent deal for a very tasty dish. Good selection of food and appetizers. Good service and live bands some nights."}
{"text":"Walked around junction looking for a patio for dinner and went to axis. Nice place. Cool paintings on the wall. Patio was small but had enough space for us. Ordered the ribs as their special and my Gf ordered the lamb burger. The ribs had a good flavor but I found it to be a little bit tough and dry. The sweet potato fries I had with it was missing a chipotle sauce. Got mayo instead. Otherwise they were good. Had some of my Gf's lamb burger. I have to say that was amazing. Juicy and the tatziki sauce was a good mix. Overall decent place to hang out with a beer with some pub grub."}
{"text":"Tried Axis over the holidays for dinner and I am impressed!  Solid pub-type place with a wide menu and super friendly staff.  Our group had burgers, nachos, chicken fingers, wings and fish & chips and everyone was happy.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"In many ways Axis is 2 star. But the patio adds the star, even though the tables are wonky and it is rarely swept. It's the only patio in one of Canada's hottest hoods ! A potential goldmine.... dummies ! I have been here many times over the years and will agree with most reviewers that the service is a weak point. Only a couple of servers that have worked here have had any personality. It feels like flying with Air Canada, the \"I'm doing you a favour by serving you\" and I always tip well. Food is well presented but hit and miss.  Bottom line, this is a fantastic location and a space with good bones and a freaking patio. It needs to be sold to a 416 owner to get rid of the snarky 905 vibe that is there currently."}
{"text":"I think this place has great potential.. But as it is.. get a beer and relax. Don't expect more than that and you will be happy. Came here holiday Monday at around 2pm and all they had was a brunch menu... it's a bar with a patio. Who thinks..\"You know what ..I want to have a pint and an omelet at 2pm on a patio\"? Judging by the fact that the place is near empty no one really does.  Good luck!"}
