{"text":"This is my husband's and my favourite date night restaurant and we are here at least once a month.  I am surprised by some of the critical reviews because we have always found the food and service to be consistently excellent. We have gotten to know Greg and always look forward to an evening of chatting with him. We love the casual atmosphere as the food is fine dining quality but without a pretentious atmosphere. We enjoy the quaint yet casual atmosphere and being quite social we often end up chatting with others around us. Our favourite appetizers are the Arancini and the Embarcadero Oysters and we always have at least two dozen fresh oysters and often order seconds of the Arancini and Embarcadero Oysters. For entrees we enjoy the steak, lamb, seafood pasta and the lobster angel hair pasta. We find the quality of the food far surpasses the price of the food. After dining there last night we made a reservation for NYE and we can't wait to bring our friends to this hidden gem."}
{"text":"This is place is pricey but the atmosphere doesn't match the prices. The food however is delicious! I had the lobster and angel hair pasta and my boyfriend had the baby back ribs and they were both fantastic! It is an oyster bar but we didn't have any oysters but I hear they are amazing! I would give this place four stars because for the price you are paying you should get slightly better service but it wasn't bad by any means! It was delicious food, I could have had another order! The lobster dish actually comes with a full lobster tail right on top, not pieces of lobster like you might expect. All in all I would totally eat here again!"}
{"text":"Oysters have worms (yes, plural) in them. The waiter will avidly defend his worms and claim it's a great and wondrous thing to have worms in their food.  On top of that, they will have no problem DEMANDING you pay for said worms, up to and including threats of calling the police.  Needless to say, it was an empty threat and answers the question as to why they never seem to have a full house."}
{"text":"Dropped in for date night last night.  The special of the day Red snapper with side of mussels did not disappoint.  So fresh and flavourful without any heaviness.  

Been coming here for the past 10 years, excellent and professional service, food is always consistently well prepared and fresh.  It has got to be one of the best kept secrets of the restaurant scene.  

Oysters are the freshest around with a great selection, fish is always fresh, NEVER previously frozen and the steaks are done to perfection.

Always look forward to the great service too by the head waiter, the experience wouldn't be the same without him.  A consummate professional every time.

Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"One word, disappointed. 

This restaurant has been on my to try list for a while now. Their regular seafood menu sounds delicious and even more, their Big Taste Menu this year looked impressive. Maybe I came here with too high of expectations and hence, was extremely disappointed. I think I will give this restaurant one more shot, but it is likely that if I come back, I will only try the oysters. 

Upon entering this restaurant, I thought the setup was very cramped and uninviting. The table space was so cramped my friend actually had sore legs after dinner (she's not that tall either...consider that).

Our server was nice, but when my friend commented on how the berries in her dessert didn't look fresh his response was \"how so\" and \"I'll let the kitchen know\". I didn't appreciate his tone. But apart from that, lets discuss the menu. For $35 I got:

Course 1
Ahi tuna ceviche with roasted corn, red pepper and waffle chips
Recommended Wine Pairing

Course 2
Duck confit on smoked bacon cassoulet with red wine demi

Course 3
Chocolate mousse with berry compote and whipped cream


The ahi tuna did not taste like a ceviche. The different flavours were very unbalanced and apart from the texture and appearance I wouldn't have been able to tell it had ahi tuna.

The duck confit was probably the most disappointing this on the menu. The duck was extremely dry and stringy. That was actually a shock to me, I've never had duck like that. Duck tends to be more fatty...and the leg portion I would imagine to be rather juicy. It was everything I don't want in a duck confit. 

The chocolate mousse was grainy. Next to that, there wasn't much of a chocolate taste to it. It was more creamy than chocolatey. I do prefer my chocolate mousse to be rich, so maybe thats why I didn't appreciate the flavour of this mousse.  

Overall, I would say that my meal was a waste of calories and a waste of money. I will not pay for a meal like that again. Funny thing is I actually had a reservation for this place on Friday as well."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My boyfriend and I came here on a sunday, expecting it be busy, so we called ahead and made a reservation just incase. To our suprise, once we got there, we were the only ones in the entire place! We got the whole back room to ourselves,  with a romantic candle lit dinner. I could see how if the place filled up, it could be kind of awkward sitting so close to other customers, but that wasn't the case for us. Neither of us had ever tried oysters before, so we started with one \"oyster of the day\"  each,  and the duck spring rolls. The oysters were amazing, and they make 2 of the sauces for them in house. Once we finished that we finally decided on the sautéed oysters, and the crab cakes, AND an additional 6 \"oysters of the day\" each. We enjoyed every single dish, for both of us not being big sea food eaters,  it was awesome. We finished with dessert, the chocolate mousse and the creme brule. WOW. The service was honestly the most amazing service we have ever gotten at any other restaurant,  the lady serving us was very knowledgeable,  kept our glasses full, and asked us how every dish tasted without invading our space at all. I will be going back to this place for sure. It was an amazing experience."}
{"text":"I just want to know what the heck happened. My friends and i stopped in for dinner about a month ago and it was amazing!! We had calamari and oysters and were blown away. For dinner we had steaks and risotto and the flavours were amazing. Nibbling from my girlfriends plate i tasted what was by far the best risotto i've ever had in my life and i love risotto. I however had the steak and i have to say it was incredible! It sliced so beautifully and was cooked to perfection. The quality was top notch and was beautifully prepared. The only disappointment that night was the service. We walked in and weren't quite sure if we were to go up or to the bar on the right. We started walking into the bar when a man bellowed out to us \"3!\". Startled, we nodded yes. The most unfortunate thing was this gentleman was our waiter for the evening. For the first 30 minutes he seemed angry that he had to have anything to do with us while we watched him shmooze an older couple. Our drinks sat on the bar and we sat parched while he talked to them as though they were old friends. I could hear a bell ringing in the kitchen and he paid it no mind. Unfortunate that the service didn't match the quality of the food. It does now however. The food was so good that i just had to take another friend so she could experience it as well. The risotto was meh, calamari cold and the steak was not what i had remembered. WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED? Please if you had a guest chef before...give him/her a permanent job!!!!! I don't know if i'll be back...I may just keep my gambling to the casino across the street."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here as part of Big Taste 2018 (for those who aren't familiar, essentially a foodie event where a lot of restaurants have set menus for specific dollar amounts - in our case, $40 for a 3 course meal). It was a very short walk from Victoria-Park Stampede station, and is kind of neat because the restaurant is inside of a house. Upon walking in though, I got the vibe that they could use some renovating - the place looked kind of \"old\". Nonetheless, I really enjoyed my experience here! 

For our appetizers, we had the beef carpaccio, topped with dijon aioli, capers, shallots, truffle-infused oil and lemon juice and parmigiano-reggiano and paired with garlic crostini. I really enjoyed all the flavours of this dish. We also tried the ahi tuna poke bowl, and enjoyed it but in my opinion, the portion was quite small.

For our entrees, we both got the steak and lobster - AAA Alberta petite beef tenderloins cooked to medium rare, lobster meat, creamy lobster roux sauce, mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables. I swear I actually had to stop myself from drooling writing that last sentence. The tenderloin was so, well for lack of better word - tender. You could tell it was really good quality beef. There was a sufficient amount of lobster meat and I loved that I didn't have to put in the work to pick it out of the shell. The sauce was delicious (I soaked up every drop with my food). 

For dessert, we had these cute little dark & white chocolate truffles. Overall, I enjoyed my experience here! The service was attentive and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant on a rainy day and it was empty at the beginning but a few guests trickled in later in the night. We originally came for just the oysters but the waiter who was super funny and friendly told us the daily special and it sounded really good so we got a dozen oysters and the special. The radish for the oysters and the oysters themselves were really good. It was so good we ordered another dozen. Our meal came and it was a lot of food as well. Maybe it was because we each just had a dozen oysters each but 2 people were able to share the meal and we were so full afterwards! I would definitely want to come here again. The waiter was also really funny and good at checking up with us and making sure our glasses were full without being the type that invades your privacy too much!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  When I search for the best places to eat, I cannot believe The Embarcadero does not show up.  We came to Calgary last year and again this weekend, and I think next time we come I want to eat here everyday.  The food is fantastic, the service outstanding, and nowhere else we go compares.  The seafood dishes are to die for!"}
{"text":"Went there for a girls night there back in October.  Our waitress was personable and friendly.  The setting was nice but casual which is not what I'd expect from the pricing of the place.  We got drinks right away and waited for the rest of our group to arrive.  There were 10 of us, so a big group, but not huge.  We had booked a reservation for 15 so they were somewhat prepared for us.  Once the other girls arrived we all had drinks.  Our orders were taken promptly.  I ordered all appies as I am not a seafood fan.  It's know for it's oysters, but I wasn't going to go there.  I had a caesar salad with garlic anchovy dressing, french onion soup and I split asiago and herb roasted mushroom risoto balls with an oven roasted tomato garlic aioli.  The mushroom risoto balls were the high light of my meal.  They were so good!  The soup and salad were good as well, but pretty typical.  There's only so many ways you can do both of those.    One of the girls had the oysters and she said they were good, but not the best she ever had.  Once we finished our meal the service went down hill quickly.  The waitress barely came to check on us.  More drinks probably would have been ordered and I know I would have liked more water.  Once we hunted her down and asked for our bills that was quite the wait too.  She apologized to us, but the apology was lacking sincerity.  I'm not sure I care to go back.  If I did, it would be for one thing... the mushroom risoto balls."}
{"text":"Came here for Big Taste 2016 in March and am pretty sure I blocked the whole experience from my brain. Drove past the other day and realised I was still unimpressed with everything. Awful experience based on food and nothing else to recommend it. Not sure why people ever eat here!

So first off have wanted to eat here for ages and Big Taste was a great excuse. Menu looked good and decided to take my friend for her birthday dinner and we could share and try everything. Dinner was $35 each. The dining area is tiny and felt like I was eating on an airplane with the amount of space we had at our tiny table.One waiter frantically running around and cant quite tell if he just didn't care or was just tired out from all the running. This is what we chose food wise...

COURSE 1
Stuffed mushroom - crab, Parmigiano-Reggiano, béchamel sauce, port wine and balsamic reduction
and
Duck spring rolls - deep fried, pulled duck confit, radish, carrot, shallots, dark cherry hoisin sauce

COURSE 2
Seafood Linguine - asiago and panko crusted Atlantic cod, sautéed prawns, mussels, julienned vegetable, creamy lobster sauce 
and
Vegatarian Risotto - mascarpone risotto, sautéed cremini mushroom, sweet pea, seasonal vegetable, lemon juice, truffle infused oil

COURSE 3
Vanilla Cheesecake - baked cheese cake, graham cracker crust, berry compote
and
Baby Bundt Cake - mini chocolate on chocolate baby bundt cake, Chantilly cream, caramel

It is important to note that at that time all items were on their regular menu which just makes this worse for me.

Course 1: 
Where are the mushrooms? There are 3 tiny little button mushrooms on this plate. Their taste is overshadowed by my indignation on the portion size. If you need to make the portion that small for the menu to be that price - leave it off! The duck spring rolls are ok, if you have no problem with your duck tasting like pulled pork without the flavour.

Course 2:
Where is the seafood? Are we again doing that thing where we leave a whole lot off of the dish to make it fit a price point? Sauce was runny and had no flavour, pasta was overcooked, and hardly any seafood to speak of. This is on your regular menu like this? But wait I haven't even told you about the risotto. No truffle oil, doesn't even smell like ruffle oil was opened next to it. And the vegetables looked like they had been thawed from a bag and a piece of each kind thrown on the side of the plate. I have eaten 3 button mushrooms, am really hungry and now am eating my disappointment with a very sad face.

Course 3:
Cheesecake is drowned in compote that tastes like it came out of a jam jar. Chocolate bundt cake is at least ok but nothing can save this meal.

I am still upset I paid so much. I have had better food at Denny's. There are amazing restaurants in this town, please go to anyone of them rather than here. No idea how anyone has given this place 5 stars? Writing this review has made me sad-mad all over again."}
{"text":"I love this place have to admit the service is excellent ended up leaving Shokunin and coming here was the best choice I made. They actually care about quality and service me and my girlfriend enjoyed it and we will be back."}
{"text":"Love the oysters! Lots of selection and love the pickled radish that goes with the oysters. Best lamb and duck! Love the fresh warm bread."}
{"text":"We went to this place before a Flames game and the place was packed.  Thank goodness we made a reservation, but expect drinks and food to come slowly during  a game night.  We didn't eat any raw oysters (or any seafood for that matter) because raw oysters are hit and miss (as in you'll probably get sick 1/10 or more times even at the best restaurant serving fresh seafood).  I wasn't gonna chance it, especially when the facilities at the Saddledome is not all that nice and often full during intermissions. 

Back to the food and drinks.  I ordered 2 pints of beer through out the night.  The size of the pint was not consistent.  The first 'pint' was significantly smaller than the second one... The second pint was really a pint, whereas I got short changed by about 150 ml on the first one.  

The food that we ordered were good... above average I would say and in line with what I expected for the price.  The baby back ribs was good and meaty and the portion was actually bigger than expected.  

As for the service, it was okay given that it was a game night.  The server did not come around all that often, but met our needs when she did come around."}
{"text":"Second time at Embarcadero. We were the only table there. The service here is always great, we got a little lesson on wine service from our lovely waiter. Started our night with a bottle of Malbec from Argentina. We had about 2 dozen of the daily oyster special for $1.25 each, malpeque oysters from PEI. They were fabulous with the green tobasco and lemon. Ended up ordering another bottle of wine and a side of fries. The fries were not the greatest but we munched on them regardless."}
{"text":"Love this place! Nice variety of oysters and would definitely recommend the beef carpaccio."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 5 for their $1.25 oyster special. We ordered 3 appetizers (duck ravioli, beef carpaccio, and tiger prawns), oyster platter and about 60 oyster specials. The ravioli pasta seemed a little undercooked, the carpaccio was just ok, best app was the prawns. As for the oysters, they were good however who ever was shucking them didn't do that great of a job. Majority of the oysters weren't separated from the shell and we spent more time than needed to separate the meat from the shell."}
{"text":"Great experience and very good food! The food has to be OUTSTANDING for me to give 5 stars, but it certainly was tasty and I left very satisfied. I had the vegetarian risotto with scallops added to it (it has a specific name, but I can't recall). My cousin had the prawn risotto. We were both happy. The wine was also very tasty. 
Our server was awesome and very engaging. He was attentive to our needs and I'd say went above and beyond most! The atmosphere is intimate and cozy. Really close to saddledome, BMO Centre, etc. So it's a perfect spot to hit up before an event.
The washrooms are cold and dark, but really, how long are you in there for unless you happen to eat a bad shrimp or something? ;) 
Overall, I'd recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"This has been my parents favourite restaurant for 10+ years. They always went for their date nights and would come home with stories about the food, wine, and of course the head waiter, Greg. So eventually I had to try it out for myself. Now, being the oyster lover I am, I was pretty much hooked from the get go - the oysters are amazingly fresh and tasty. I've also had the pleasure of trying their steak, pasta, and a few other appetizers, and everything was delicious. The servers make you feel like family, they are always smiling and joking with you and making sure you are comfortable and happy. I love to come here late night after some gambling across the street for an oyster platter and Patron shots =) I always get treated very well, the atmosphere is cozy and warm, and the food is yummy. I will continue returning here, along with my family, for many years to come."}
{"text":"A truly hidden gem in Calgary. We found it doing a Google search and were more than pleasantly surprised. Excellent food and even better service. We were the only ones in the restaurant for a while, so we probably overstayed our welcome and enjoyed our wine and almost a whole second meal hours later. We became fast friends with our server Juanita, who was outstanding, and then later enjoyed Greg and his humor and enthusiasm. Everything we ate was outstanding, and both my friend and I have pretty high standards. Do not miss this gem in Calgary! We ended our week in Alberta on a very positive note. Thank you Embarcadero!"}
{"text":"Oh Embarcadero...how do we love thee...Our favorite go to in the Stampede area. Sat din was friggin outstanding. Kusshi oysters on sale!!! Followed by a kick ass duck confit. What a great menu addition. Topped off by the usual impeccable service and conversation from Greg....not Craig!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! The outside appearance just adds to the charm of this restaurant. The service was great and the house Pinot Noir is worth getting the bottle. After my first order of oysters, the special was pacific for $1.25 ea, I HAD to get another. They were fresh and full of flavor. I was sad to see they didn't have a house sauce for them but that's a minor detail. The surf and turf was sublime. The scallops were perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. The lobster was perhaps the best I've had and the crab sauce was the only one I've not only liked, but loved. The vegetables were fresh and cooked to perfection. The filet Mignon was as delectable as it was tender. My only let downs were the cheese cake, it had a tuti-fruity kind of flavor, and the bread which was lackluster not only by comparison to the rest of the meal but for any table bread."}
{"text":"First time here, our server while both witty and knowledgeable with the menu, seemed quite slow as our drinks sat empty for a while and took about 10 minutes to come take our order in the beginning. 
I would understand if it was busy, but there was only my table and another table occupied in the restaurant. 

It definitely did not bother me though, because the food was absolutely amazing. Will definitely be coming again soon."}
{"text":"It was my first time back here in a long time and my boyfriend and I decided to pop in for some drinks and oysters. Perfect date spot in my opinion. Small, yet quaint. 

Definitely some of the best Oysters in Calgary. Undeniably fresh and fair in size. The salsa they provide is the perfect addition to make them pop. Alongside the oysters, we chose to have some bruschetta, just to keep the \"fresh\" theme ongoing. Although our meal was rather small this time around, I am rather anxious to go back."}
