{"text":"This will not take long... Finestre is my favorite restaurant for any occasion! We went in completely skeptical and left feeling like we had found long lost family members. David made us feel like he had made our meal specially for us, and as we heard him talking to others he was doing the same for everyone. I don't know how he and his lovely wife are capable of keeping it all straight but what a special place this is. You will not be disappointed with your meal. The food is truly remarkable and tastes equivalent to the best meals I've ever had, if not more so.

Thank you Finestre, you have earned a couple more fanatics."}
{"text":"Chef David is unapologetic regarding his culinary point of view. Unwavering in his pursuit of gastronomic excellence, he leverages an array of techniques that are as simple as they are progressive. The vibe at Finestre is extremely casual. Do not let their website deceive you. Chef encourages you to stay for hours, pause between courses, and relax. Foodies are welcome here - but please, leave your snobby friends at home. This won't be their scene."}

{"text":"You have got to eat here! 

The pork belly and the Wagyu beef ravioli were absolutely brilliant. Don't forget about the dessert either the brownie was the BEST BROWNIE I HAVE EVER EATEN! 

Chef David was magnificent and you can see how passionate he is about his food and he loves explaining how he thought up the dishes when he has time to do so.

The service is great and the wait staff know the menu well and are capable of offering advice on what meals and drinks to go for.

I'm just visiting Phoenix, AZ but I'll definitely be back to Finestre next time I visit."}
{"text":"Since I often only make it past the first sentence when I read reviews, I will simply say, EAT AT FINESTRE! Seriously, this needs to be on your list of places to try in the Valley. I don't write many reviews but I felt compelled to help this new restaurant because I want to go back.

Where to start?

These are great people. That is the first thing you will realize when you meet the owners. And you will meet the owners since Sherri runs the front of house and David, the chef, makes multiple trips to everyones table. My wife made a reservation for our 13th Anniversary. We ordered the 7 course Prix-Fixe with the wine tasting. Amazing. We will be back to get the 9 course Japanese Wagyu Menu. Even though it was not part of our meal, David brought us to kitchen and cooked two pieces of Wagyu tri-tip with a blowtorch as our 8th course. Unbelievable. In addition, I asked if he could incorporate lace into our dinner since it is the traditional gift for a 13 year anniversary. He specially made lace cookies, texted me pictures of them in the morning, and served them on his brownie dessert. I am pretty sure that is the definition of above and beyond. 

The portions were large for a typical tasting menu and the wine pours were generous. There wasn't one part of the meal we didn't like. Typically in a paired wine dinner, we usually don't like one or two of the pours, but that wasn't the case here. Excellent selections from the US, France and Italy. The meal for us was the right pace (~2.5hrs), but they were willing to accomodate any pace we desired and asked up front about it. The only suggestion we would make would be to change the cutlery between courses. But being that we were there on their grand opening, I am sure they will work out these kinks. 

The food is delicious, the wine is unique, and the people are great. This is a special place and I predict it will be hard to get a reservation once the word gets out. I suggest you go before it gets discovered."}
