{"text":"I despise Chinese food, ever since a bad experience at Foody-Goody many years ago.  But the Pink Pearl is one place that I really actually quite liked, food and all.  There was about 12 of us in a wrap-up dinner we had a few weeks ago, we had reservations, but there was lots of room so we were seated on our own.  I imagine that lunches would be busy, but evenings would be a great time to go for a quiet dinner.  The service was fantastic, quick and very friendly.  Our waitress was quick to answer any questions we had, or even make suggestions as to quantities and add-on dishes we weren't sure about.  The food came quickly, and was hot, and great portion sizes.  It fed our group of mostly single, male students without any problems.  Now, as I said earlier, I really, really dislike Chinese food after a bad experience, involving questionable meat... and a chain being shut down.  I'll eat Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Mongolian, Indian, but Chinese food has been off the menu... until this restaurant.  The Ginger Beef was fantastic and I filled up on Lemon Chicken.  So don't let the kind of tacky pink neon and mirrors throw you off, the Pink Pearl is worth stopping for a great Chinese meal."}
{"text":"Hot and yummy Chinese food in a sea of average downtown lunch places. The perfect place to grab a quick and filling lunch to take back to the office. The Szechuan chicken, calamari & Singapore vermicelli are all good and at ~$6.50 an order, you are not going to break the bank.  The take out area is open from 11am to 1pm and makes it convenient and easy to order. They only accept cash at the take out area, if you need to use card, you will have to actually go into the Restaurant.  4/30"}
{"text":"stopped for lunch here after it was recommended by a family member. food was amazing, especially the sweet and sour chicken. the tea was great as well. would totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"They have a takeout counter that provides very quick service....too quick if you ask me. The food is bland and flavorless. Wor Won Ton was so boring. The fried chicken and beef in the ginger dishes is over battered. Cheap quick eats but not too tasty."}
{"text":"Such great location in the heart of downtown, big place in Banker's Hall, but the food was nothing special. Definitely not among my top 5 chinese places. My thoughts after I paid the 35$ bill and left the place was: What a pity. So much opportunity."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get your chinese food. They have a nice lunch selection, order at a seperate counter. Its inside the Eaton Center off 8th. You can to go in and sit down. The wait staff is nice and professional. The serving size is huge! We only order one dish and one rice and it is more then enough!  All in all I will continue to eat here. So far it the best chinses we have found."}
