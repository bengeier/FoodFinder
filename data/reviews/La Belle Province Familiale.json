{"text":"Here's my order on Feb 25 2017. Smoked meat plate, cheeseburger,2 steamies. There has been some comments regarding owner/employee ethnicities...WHO CARES? These guys just don't know what they're doing. First thing they did was put my fries and hotdogs on my tray, then put the patty on the grill for the cheeseburger. WRONG! By the time the burger and smoked meat were done, everything else was cold! Start the burger FIRST, then start on the sandwich, then the dogs. Fries are the LAST to go on the tray. This advice comes from a Greek who used to work in the business. BTW, smoked meat rubbery, rye bread stale,meat to bun ratio for cheeseburger WAY off, either more meat or less bun, figure it out, fries were dry, hot dogs...meh. Never going back, place is a dump."}
{"text":"First of all, La Belle Pro, anywhere has never left me disenchanted. This location left me with a whole new perspective. I suppose business isn't brisk if you are using stale buns for your hot dogs. The fries weren't cooked enough either.... and the 7 up from the fountain was watery. The icing on the cake was the fact that their employee goes from cash to food without washing. The best though is how they hide the napkins. I had to request several times for napkins. Their napkin allocation is meagre, and I am assuming that the owners watch whats meted out. I will be a whole lot more careful next time I find myself famished. So be warned, this location is dirty and can't even succeed with simple steamies and fries."}
{"text":"I read some of the old reviews sporting some hefty criticism and it seems that the Asians owner do take heed at some of the remarks on Yelp for my Poutine was made with insanely hot gravy. In fact, I had to sit out 3-4 minutes for it to cool down.  The portions are generous. That family size (to be shared... or not... if you wish to have a heart attack in your 30s), is a generous quantity for the low price of 11$+tax. The steamed hot dogs all dressed, 1.09$+tax each. The fries are pretty good, the cheese is typical Poutine cheese curds although the gravy seems somewhat tasteless.   This isn't the best tasting food but it certainly is far from the worst. I'd place it above average but Belle Province, as far as I can remember, since my childhood, was never really about the quality but about the [(quantity+(quality/3)]/price. Yes, that's my mathematical equation for Belle Pro standards. Discounting all-you-can-eat buffets, I'd say Belle Pro gives out the best quantity/price output in the West Island. So, if you're not afraid of carbs (or if you're feeling up for your arteries to be clogged with cholesterol), this is one of the best places to have a decent snack on a budget in the West.  The place is surprisingly clean and the owners are pretty friendly. Service was quick.  P.S. A warning to the ladies. I've heard rumors of certain Paki employees sleazily flirting with girls. It happened to one of my friends, and, apparently, others before her."}
{"text":"They were so good a few years back.. before the \"asians\" took over. I mean the Dr. Knows a good Labelle when he eats it but apart from keeping the old owner on as a mentor the place is lack luster."}
{"text":"I love La Belle Province.   I really wish this location was better. It goes to show you that it's a franchise, and each Storefront will be different if not managed by the same people.   My sister and I came for lunch with her friend who lives nearby and knows good food. He told me it has just changed ownership. I spoke with the cooks and was happy to hear they're Greek, okay I'm stereotyping about how great of cooks they are.  The fries were just good, the cheese was like rubber and didn't melt in the Poutine, not good.    The smoked meat sandwich was not Hot like the other ones I've had. And it seemed like the smoked meat was cheap and generic.  The hands of new ownership seems to be going downhill, shame.  The decor also seems to be old and wearing down and looks dirty, again shame 50's decor should be fun, not old."}
{"text":"1 star is too high for this place. Stale buns, bathroom is filthy, employee's hands moves from cash to cheese curds without a wash, friend had to wait 20+ minutes for a burger. These are facts. No wonder they got written up in a \"Top 10 Filthiest Places in Montreal\" newspaper article a few years ago."}
{"text":"Good sandwich shop.  My first taste of Poutine and I love it!  next trip a Smoked Meat sandwich with my Poutine.  I can feel my belly grumbling now."}
{"text":"Recently changed owners again. No longer the Asian owner. I visited 2 weeks ago for a fairly large order. The owner was at the cash and open-mouthed coughed into the register and on his hands. He then proceeded to help the cook fill the order without gloves and without washing his dirty hands. The cook had dropped a wax paper hotdog wrap on the floor, the owner picked it up and returned it to the counter and sure enough, the cook used it. Gross! If you complain - you get \"the special\" - better to just warn others and never return."}
{"text":"Unimpressed by this place.  Average food, facilities and dining area could be cleaner."}
{"text":"My Stepson was craving hot dogs while we were at the mall but instead of getting them from Double Pizza, I said let's just go to La Belle since we were right there.  We left the mall, got to the resto and it has been shut down!  I had no idea.  It has always looked like a rundown place and there weren't any signs that we saw so... Surprise!!!  Oh well. Another time and another location.  I have no idea if it's just being renovated or not but it looks like it won't be opening there again."}
{"text":"I recently tried this place again after living beside it for the past 17 years ... it used to be to 50 cent hotdogs and it's always been a dump.... sad to read reviews and hear that they are still coughing on people's food and their hands ... this place has always been disgusting and I feel the need to warn people . Belle province is great but the belle province in this locating is crap... by the way their poutine is like soup"}
{"text":"I don't really like writing negative reviews but eat here at your own risk. Dining room really looks unclean, they'll handle your money and turn around and touch your food without washing hands. Their cook was wearing a dirty old baseball cap and kept adjusting it every few minutes while flipping burgers. If you get sick,  can't say nobody warned you"}
