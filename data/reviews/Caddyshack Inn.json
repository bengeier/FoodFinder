{"text":"If you're looking for a fun little dive bar with amazing burgers, this place is for you! It looks a little sketch from the outside, and it's certainly nothing fancy inside - but wow, are the burgers worth the venture in. Plus it's insanely cheap, good food and drinks, in a fun atmosphere. My husband and I each had a sandwich (me a wrap and him the double patty burger), plus we shared the sampler appetizer platter, and he also got six wings ... all that combined with 3-4 drinks each (beer for me, mixed drinks for him) was only $47 total. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Caddyshack is a place that has local appeal, great food, cheap drinks, and a friendly owner.  The locals that hang out there are friendly and welcoming.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Caddyshack has a fantastic kitchen and a great bar.  When Brooke is working, she takes care of everyone in the joint without delay.  Simply amazing.  There can be 5 people or 50 people, you are never waiting for food or drink when she is running the place!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! The ambiance can affectionately be described as \"quaint\"...but who cares about that? The story here is the amazing burger and in house chips and dip. Phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Have heard good things about this \"under the radar\" spot, and the family was hunkering for burgers...so we figured \"what the hey?!?!?\"  We decided to split a few appetizers before sinking out teeth into the burgers.  My wife and I ordered a couple of drafts and they brought us the first course...fried pickles.  The spears were molten hot, but once they cooled a bit we discovered they were crispy, tangy and served with a ranch dipping sauce.  Good stuff!  Next, we dug into a basket of 12 \"hot\" flavored wings.  The drummies and wings were cooked firm/crisp and they were plump and juicy on the inside, covered in a perfect hot sauce and served with bleu cheese dressing.  I was really surprised at the quality of this dish.  Last, for the main course...the burgers.  Each burger was mammoth (1/2 lb. cheeseburger and a full-pound Big Shak)!  Unfortunately, they were slightly overcooked (given out temp choices) but still juicy on the inside.  The Brioche bun was grilled and held up well to the huge slabs of meat and extra toppings.  The basket was served with homemade chips and a French onion dipping sauce.  My wife really loved these chips and dip!  So...overall this was a somewhat unexpected surprise and we will most certainly be back.  Casual atmosphere, a connected driving range!, cheap beers and quality food.  In..."}
{"text":"I usually hit up the Caddyshack after practice. It's got great food (the wings are cheap and delicious) and affordable alcohol. It's not a 5-star place, but for a low-key time with cheap drinks and food, it's the place to go."}
{"text":"Caddyshak has good food and drinks at reasonable prices. I've never had a bad meal here. For $6 try any if the wraps and don't bother getting fries the chips that they come with are excellent and they come with delicious homemade chip dip. This place is a local hangout in Hinckley that's a great place to go after a round of golf at one of the many courses in the area. Or go before your round and warm up at the driving range on site. I've been going here since it was the golfers inn ( many years ago) and if has improved through the years."}
{"text":"This is a dive bar (which happens to be my preference.) That said, I was craving a good burger on my way home from work so thought I'd check if they have takeout. The bartender who answered was a little short with me and clearly seemed annoyed. Which is why only 4 stars. But from there everything got better. I ordered a straight cheeseburger cooked medium which comes with homemade chips and a dill dip. The burger was very big, cooked perfectly and DELICIOUS. The chips were excellent and the dip was so good I ate it all before I was halfway through the chips.   Bottom line, great option for takeout. Plus they have a huge menu. (*They take credit cards but a $10 minimum.)"}
{"text":"I went a couple of weeks ago and am going again tonight.   Good, reasonably priced food.  Very friendly staff.   Lots of food to choose from.   I had a chicken hilly steak and it was delicious."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for a few years now and really enjoy the bar food, the fish fry during Lent is a must try for anyone who enjoys a good fish fry, get there early place p√†cks them in,  decent beer selection and mixed drinks, place not much to look at on the outside and not very big on the inside, but if you want good food and decent drinks and friendly people, give it a try."}
{"text":"Was recommended to taste fish fry dinner because I am a fan of perch. Everyone was very nice. The fish was good but a little bland. I did fall in love for the pierogies. Never thought I was a fan but I can't wait to have them again with something besides the fish. Can't wait to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Best local dive in the area! Great food, good service and a nice change of pace from the chain locations. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Local establishment!!  Great burgers and cold drinks at very reasonable prices.  Owner Nick is friendly and the staff was great!  Definitely stop in sometime soon."}
