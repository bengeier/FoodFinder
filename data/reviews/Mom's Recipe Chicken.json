{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm a self-professed chicken addict, so a restaurant like this caters exactly to my tastes. I was super ecstatic that there was a new restaurant in town with a small menu of all things chicken - Chinese style.  If you're vegetarian or hoping there are other proteins that is not chicken on the menu to accommodate, now is the time to look elsewhere. They don't even offer just vegetables or sides. Every single item on the menu is a different type of chicken.   I ordered the Hainan Chicken Rice and Tea Fragrant Chicken with Lo Mein (you can also substitute with rice as well). All of their entrees come with small bowl of soup and 2 stalks of bok choy for $8.50+tax. With inflation and wage increases hitting the service sector hard, I appreciated that there was still a restaurant out there offering a full meal under $10 per person price point (even amongst Asian restaurants this is challenging to find).   Portion was good and filling (almost half a chicken for each entree!). I left stuffed. If it is your first time, I suggest Hainan Chicken Rice as a safe way to go for something flavorful but not overpowering. However, the Tea Fragrant Chicken is one of their specialty and more unique in taste - has a nice smokey flavor which complemented the light green onion Lo Mein I chose it with.  Parking is ample in the Chinatown plaza (except probably busy times like weekends when you're fighting with patrons at the dim sum restaurant beside it). Seating inside is quite limited with a few tables and some bar stools on the side, however it doesn't seem to be that busy that you would be waiting. It can get quite cold in the winter if you're facing the door and customers open the door a lot.  Your meal is served in a tray with plastic cup for tea. I would prefer a real china cup, but not gonna harp too much on that. Servers are friendly and attentive since the place is really small.  I will be back to try some of their other chicken dishes.  Pro-tip: If you plan to eat here often, get their gift card of $100 for $80 cash so you get a bit of a discount. This also applies to takeout for their chicken (which I also get for a lazy dinner at home!)"}
{"text":"4.5 stars  Great value and great taste!   Would come back. Lots of variety of chicken with rice or noodles and soup. Quick service. Fresh and authentic Chinese taste. Fills you up!"}
{"text":"Randomly tried out this place, got the Hainan chicken it was very good and price was decent. Definitely give this place a try if you never been."}
{"text":"I didn't know about this place until one day I was at the mall for banking. This place specializes in different type of chicken, from soy sauce chicken to salt bake chicken. I got a takeout for tea fragrance chicken (half) and it was amazing, you can certainly taste the tea flavour that was smoked with the chicken, and the meat was awesome, tender and not dry at all. it's about $9.50 for half chicken, which is reasonable in my opinion. it's great, the place is small, yet you can still order and eat there too"}
{"text":"We got the tea fragrant chicken with rice and noodle soup. The chicken was delicious; cooked and seasoned just right. The noodle soup was a bit bland to our taste however. HUGE portions for a really good price (couldn't finish my bowl of rice, but it was big bowl). Environment is nice and quiet (some music could be fun) and service is prompt."}
{"text":"This is a casual restaurant featuring Chicken cooked in various Asian ways.  The value, i.e. portion vs. price is GREAT!  This eatery is location inside Mississauga Chinatown and is newly renovated on the interior.  It is clean, bright, and modern.  Menu is a good length.  There are only a coupla photos, so if you read Chinese, the dishes may be more descriptive.  Otherwise, there are things on the menu like \"Crispy Chicken\" (similar to katsu) and \"Tasty Chicken\" (waitress said was spicy, but I have no idea how it is cooked).  So photos would be helpful.  Crispy Chicken again was like katsu, but not crusted in panko crumbs.  Although tasty, it could've used a bit of salt.  Chicken of Choice + a soup, and either rice or lo mein = $8.50.  I ate about half of the dish, so if you're not a terribly big eater, you can share 1 dish!  This value is excellent as Chicken katsu at other places is easily $14-15.  My mom had the Hainan Chicken and liked it, although she said that it needed a bit more seasoning.  Chicken was cooked well.  Accompanying sauces were good!  Overall, prices and portions are excellent.  Chicken itself could use a bit more seasoning, but at least it's not MSG-y/overly salted.  Will definitely be back to try other dishes!"}
