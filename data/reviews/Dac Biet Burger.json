{"text":"Tried dac biet burger tonight for the first time. I decided on the pho burger with a side of kimchi fries. The burger was absolutely delicious! Burger was cooked to perfection....juicy! It came with a side of pho jus (for dipping). The burgers are freshly ground and cooked to order. The kimchi fries were amazing as well! So much flavour! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had the pho burger. Tasted like pho in hamburger form. The soup made an excellent dipping sauce. Burger looked beautiful, will throw it up on the insta!"}
{"text":"I love pho and I love burgers - clearly, Dac Biet Burger is the best of both worlds. It's amazing how the people at Dac Biet Burger have absolutely nailed the flavour and essence of pho and captured it in the pho burger. 

The pho burger was delicious, juicy, and came with a side of the broth. Portion-wise, I was led to believe from some other reviews that it would be small, but I found it to be satisfactorily filling. 

The place is a bit small with 5 high stools, so I'd grab it to go and find a nice bench to savor the burger, especially if it's busy inside. The guys working were super nice though, even asked how the first few bites were! All in all, great burger, great place."}
{"text":"As we sit here, just finishing our burgers, we very quickly realize we need more! These burgers are fantastically creative and the fries are perfect, golden goodness! We walked 20 minutes to get here, and it was definitely worth the effort. We had the Kalbi Burger 8oz and the Cheese Burger 8oz, both with fries and a pop. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great burger place! One of the best burgers I've had. Would definitely come back next time in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Tasty burger. Super friendly owners. 

You can really taste the flavor of pho in the burger. 

It's a bit messy to eat. 

They grind their burger meat fresh every day.

The only criticism is that it's kinda expensive for the size. It's not a big burger for 7.50. Comes out to 8.50 with tax. Reg fries and a drink for $4."}
{"text":"Wow!!! I had the pho burger and the dac biet poutine. The burger was pho-king pho-bulous. The burger was enriched with a lot of pho flavour, and the buns were warm and crispy. I like how it wasn't the basic lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, and ketchup type of burger. It's nice to change it up a bit. Instead the burger consisted of basil leaves, bean sprouts, and hoisin sauce. This is definitely a game changer. It even came with a little bowl of soup, in which you can either sip on or dip your burger in. 

The dac biet poutine was whatever. Nothing special about it. Just cheese curds with gravy made with pho broth.

The owners are super nice and welcoming. I enjoyed my whole experience and can't wait to go back to try their other burgers!"}
{"text":"Really good unique viet western fusion. Pho burger was super yummy. Kimchi poutine was better than ban mi boys. The owners take a lot of care in each burger they make. Nothing about their food is sloppy. Definitely a gem in the city"}
{"text":"Such a great place at reasonable prices. Pho burger was outstanding.  Their Kalbi burger was pretty good as well, their Kimchi could use more kick but once you add some Sirracha you are in burger heaven. The poutine is missing the squeaky cheese curds but their pho gravy more than makes up for it, and they layered the cheese in between the fries to guarantee melted cheese goodness. Service was friendly and left you feeling your business was appreciated."}
{"text":"Small place, yummy, fresh food! Came here with a friend as we were looking for something quick with quality. Did a quick yelp search for Asian + burgers (we couldn't decide what we wanted), found this, and we were not disappointed! The man who was taking orders is also super nice, hard to find service like this at this price."}
{"text":"Went here because of the yelp reviews which were spot on.  Owner working the cashier and all the cooks were very friendly and very appreciative of every customer in there.   All the patties are made fresh daily.   Burgers were excellent.  Perfect meat:bun ratio, with kimchi as a topping.  Messy burger but they know this and gave me nice tray to collect any potential spills.  Poutine was good as well. High turnover rate, easily got a seat within a few minutes during weekday Lunch hour.  Would definitely go back I can try the rest of the menu.   highly recommend.  burgers took about 5-10 min to get."}
{"text":"I've tried their burgers twice.  The first time was the teriyaki burger.  I thought it was pretty good.  The extra toppings made it interesting but I didn't think the combination really worked.  So the next time I tried just a regular cheeseburger, which is actually my favorite, and it was very disappointing.  The patty was dry and flat, much like what one gets at McDonald's, and besides that there really wasn't anything special.  It tasted like ketchup, mayo, dry beef, cheese, a slice of tomato and some bread, which is what it was.  It didn't really work together.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and love to see another interesting addition to this culinary corner.   Great fusion. I had the teriyaki burger very nice blend of tastes with out being over powering. Burger itself was very nice, not greasy. Very nice and helpful staff.  I will definitely be going back to try the pho burger."}

{"text":"I tried the pho burger combo. It was $11 (cash or debit only) and included a burger, fries and pop. The fries were awesome -- nice and crispy, and plentiful. The burger itself was really good -- not enough to make me want to go back and get another tomorrow, but I'll probably visit again in a few months (and perhaps try something different). All in all it's a good deal for what you get. And the servers/cooks were super friendly. Be warned though that the place is small with only five or six stools so don't plan on sitting if you're there at a busy time. I'd recommend overall."}
{"text":"My favourite burger place on TO. Love the side broth that came with the pho burger. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing.  If you're tired of the same old burger, this place is a good place to try."}
{"text":"Really well priced, excellent Asian-fusion burgers. The guys are really friendly and take pride in their menu. Flavours are simple yet powerful. Highly recommend the Pho burger."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and I must say their Asian fusion burgers are delicious.  If you love burgers and you want to try something different I would definitely recommend coming here.  The burgers are made fresh and always served juicy and hot.  

My favourite burgers are the pho burger and banh mi burger.  The pho burger comes with a side of authentic pho broth that is really yummy for dipping your burger.  The banh mi burger has more of a light, refreshing taste but also very good.

Last but not least, the thing I always crave for is the Kim chi fries.  I always order a side of the fries, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"The Pho burger was surprisingly tasty.  As a novelty burger, I expected it not to be good, but to my surprise all the ingredients really work together, especially the broth dip.  My only complaint is I had to wait a bit and there isn't much room to sit down."}
{"text":"Wow, This place was fantastic. I know it didn't open long ago, but I'm sure by this time next year there will be lines out the door and they'll be selling out by 6 pm daily.

I got the Pho burger and it was the most unique, juicy, flavorful burger I've ever had. The sauteed bean sprouts offer a grilled onions kind of flavor, topped with basil, sriracha, and hoisin flavors. The pho broth on the side is a nice addition.. The owner said to dip the burger in it but I preferred to sip it. The burger was perfect as it was but I get that it wouldn't be a pho burger without the broth.

My boyfriend got the regular cheeseburger and said it was a solid burger. We wanted to come back the next day for more but they didn't open til 4 and we were heading back to the US at noon.

We shared an order of kimchi fries which were really flavorful and unique. The soft crunchiness  and delicate sour flavor of the kimchi provided a nice contrast against the fries which were not overly greasy. They had a nice wasabi mayonnaise sauce laced throughout as well.

There were two men running the place, the owner at the front and another man cooking. They both engaged with us and were very friendly. The place is tiny with just a few window bar seats, so get there when it's not packed or take it to go. They played classic rock including Fleetwood Mac and there's a big poster of Bruce Lee on the wall."}
{"text":"Arrived between 1130 and 12 to beat the rush. Good thing too because I didn't know it would take 10 minutes to prepare. Fresh tho so that's great. Seats 5 on bar stools. Make it a combo with fries and pop for 225 more. Asked me halfway thru if I wanted Sriracha. Oh yes. Asked for a reco and she said banh mi burger pho burger or cheeseburger so I went banh mi. Nice hiphop vibe. No frills love it. Overheard the pho burger comes with a side of soup WHICH YOU CAN DIP THE BURGER IN! OH MY! Smells divine. On to the food, the banh mi burger is exactly what it sounds like, delicious pork patty with cilantro mayo and picked carrots n daikon. Fries were perfect and there was a1 litre bottle of ketchup I had all to myself. Cash or debit only. Excellent experience, will be back!"}
{"text":"Had the pho burger. 

Tasted like a nice bowl of pho in burger form. Sweet hoisin,  spicy sriracha,  crispy bean sprouts and fragrant basil on top of a juicy burger. The burger bun itself was also great. It was served with a side of beef pho broth to be sipped or dipped like a french sandwich. 

The fries were also crispy and well cooked.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I went there during lunch, and I had to wait a little while to order because the two people working there were busy with a large order. Despite being pretty busy, the two people working there were kind and they looked after my order as soon as they could - even giving me a discount for having waited a little while to order!

I got the Pho Burger with the Pho jus (best pun) and it was delicious! A bit greasy, but all the best burgers are. Thank you for the excellent meal. I'll be by again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i went here for lunch and it was so delicious! We got the pho burgers and kimchi fries, it was probably the best meal out ive had in awhile. The prices are great and the employees are even better, this is a must go!"}
{"text":"This is my new favourite local! Affordable, quality burgers with fresh toppings in portions that don't leave you feeling like you'll need to be carted home in a wheelbarrow. 

The kimchi fries come with kimchi dispersed throughout the fries (not like other places where all the toppings sit on top of a nest of dry flavourless potato sticks). This will be a regular."}
{"text":"Burger was flavorful - pho burger really tasted like pho and banh mi burger taste like banh mi! Love it! Staff there was friendly as well. I would go back and try the kalbi burger and their fries!

I only wish they have more space for us to sit down and eat and more stroller friendly :)

Note that you will have to wait at least 10 minutes for a fresh yummy burger! It was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Ordered the banh mi burger and kimchi fries. Both were great options!

What I liked: great, friendly service; unique burger options; fries were crunchy and delicious

What I didn't like: burger/fries were somewhat overpriced for their size; the fries could have used more flavor/pork was a bit too dry.

Would go again to try their other options!"}
{"text":"Had the 4 oz teriyaki burger with fries. The flavour was really awesome and flavourful. 
One thing that made the burger really good for me was how the beef and all the ingredients were all homemade and super fresh. Staff is super nice. 

Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Trying this place without expectation. I ordered Kalbi burger because I saw kimchi/wasabi on the menu with kalbi sauce which I didnt know what it was, so I gave it a try. It didn't disappoint me. The stuff are friendly. Love the burger!! Fresh kimchi! I will go back for kimchi fries for sure. :)"}
{"text":"Pretty well executed Asian fusion burger. The pho soup goes do well with the burger. Yum!"}
{"text":"The Pho burger and kimchi fries are must-haves. The burger was juicy and oh so flavourful--love the bean sprouts and pho jus dipping broth that came with it. I don't even normally like kimchi, but the kimchi fries were so so good...

Only disappointment was the fact that we had to wait nearly an hour for the food to be made, which I found a bit ridiculous. The restaurant space is also quite small, having only three bar stools around the edges, so we had to stand the entire time. Seems like a lot of people used some sort of pre-order online feature, because many came into the restaurant to pick up bags and bags of burgers.

The food was really delicious, and decently priced, but the service was so slow that stars had to be taken off. :(

Will definitely try going back though, and maybe see what's up with the pre-ordering..."}
{"text":"Walked in to order for the first time today after seeing great reviews on here! Small and cozy location with a welcoming staff :)

Ordered the 4oz Pho Burger. I was distracted by the Bruce Lee quotes on the wall as I waited (not too long), so the young lady kindly brought the burger to me. +1 for customer service as she unnecessarily went out of her way to do so! 

Beef patty was perfectly done, and the Pho added great taste! Little bowl of soup to dip/drink was a welcomed touch. Enjoyed my experience, would definitely recommend, and will be back :)"}
{"text":"O.M.G sooo good! The pho burger is out of this world! Get this burger. Nice small cozy restaurant with super friendly staff. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"Unassuming storefront. Amazing burgers! We got pho burger and kalbi burger. Both were great. I liked the pho burger a bit more. You get a little cup of pho jus to sip. It was seriously equal parts pho taste and burger taste. I was like how is this possible?? The fiancé liked kalbi and pho burgers in equal measure.

You can order via ritual or foodora too if short on time or can't make it there to pick up.

Nice owner. Humble and friendly."}
{"text":"I popped by this place the other day to give it a try, the owners were two super nice and accommodating fellows who seemed to be pretty passionate about their new burger shop.  

Knowing that this is an Asian inspired burger place I still felt the need to try their regular burger first, after all, if you can't make a great regular hamburger then it really throws into question your abilities to make any other kind of burger. 

The burger was cooked to medium well, with a slight pinkish hue to the centre of the thick  roundish home style burger, very nice. Served on a very fresh ace bakery bun, the burger was fresh and juicy as well, they say they grind their own burger meat daily so no wonder. I also added bacon and cheese to this burger, the bacon was thick sliced, but the whole burger seemed lacking in flavor, I mean It was pretty good, but there was no \"wow that was really tasty\" moment afterwards which was a little disappointing. If I'm going to spend $14 on a burger and a side of fries, I want a little more wow/MMMM factor. Sadly it just wasn't there in that regular burger. The fries were also decent, but I'm not sure if they were fresh cut, to be honest, they didn't seem to be. The fries were served in a very cute little retro style Chinese food box with the little metal handle, unfortunately the box is tiny and so was the serving of fries. Since I had take out, they also closed the top of it, so by the time I got home with my food, the fries were steamed and a bit moist.

To be fair, they don't have a solid everyday menu chosen just yet, they just have a basic \"soft\" opening menu, so the place is still finding it's feet with what they serve. I personally feel that their regular burger needs some work, as it's in desperate need of salt blended in the burger, they do sprinkle some on before they cook it. which doesn't really help, because most of it will be left on the cooking surface. They may want to consider flattening their burger a bit more too while cooking it and try to achieve some char on the outside of it to give it some texture and some depth to it's flavor, right now it's just a big chunk/ball of meat. and it's (imo) more appealing to see the burger's flatter and larger than the bun. As it stands right now the burger is smaller than the bun. 

Overall I really think this place has great potential if they can fine tune their burgers a little more, and stop half filling the fries box and closing it for take out orders. I do feel they will get better though, as the two owners seem very willing, very passionate and really seem to care a lot about their product.

Would I suggest this place to a friend? 
yes, but I'd say to try anything but the regular burger for now. 

Will I return? 
yes, but I'm going to give them a few more weeks before I do In hopes that regular burger has improved."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's cheap, each burger is made with love by the owner, and the taste is also a novel twist on the (slowly dying as of 2015) burger trend. They offer three novel burgers (pho, banh mi, and kalbi) of which I've tried two. I'd say that the pho burger is the most pleasing - it's the familiar taste of vietnamese noodles wrapped up in the cleanliness of a hamburger and partnered with pho broth as an au jus. If you'd like, you dip the burger in the broth like a French sandwich. It's delicious.

And I'm just saying: their kimchi fries are better than Banh Mi Boys'."}
{"text":"I walk by this place almost every day on my way home from work...I noticed as work was being done on the place and its opening two months ago...other businesses in this location have not fared so well...so for lunch today, I thought I would give the burgers a try...the people are very friendly and the menu is not large, which is a good thing as they can focus on those items...well, my mouth is having a flavour explosion...I ordered the Banh Mi burger along with the Kimchi fries...this particular burger is the only one with pork...all of the burgers are ground onsite with them using top grade meat...the Banh Mi burger is so delicious...if you don't like cilantro, don't get this burger...it has cilantro/cucumber mayo and topped with pickled daikon carrots...the bun is similar to brioche...everything about this burger worked...I also had a side of Kimchi fries, topped with pulled pork and kimchi...this was so tasty and has a bit of a spicy kick...as I mentioned, other businesses have not done well in that location; I hope this one survives and their food is so good."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Fresh ground meat and really unique in a good way) fusion flavours.
I asked for my beef patty medium rare and it was good. A teensy bit overcooked but the beef is such good quality and perfectly and simply seasoned that I savoured every bite. 
Definitely looks like a small burger- it's a 4oz patty- but it IS rather filling. Quality ingredients fill you up more.

A must try!

I will say though- make sure you clarify your order. I ordered just a cheeseburger and got charged 9$ for it.

I think I didn't realize what was happening and just paid- they up-sold me some fries and I didn't really realize. The fries are a pass item. Next time I gotta pay more attention instead of just handing them my money. haha."}
{"text":"Tucked away on Church street, this petite shop specializes in burgers that have a unique Asian fusion twist to them. 

I ordered a Pho burger and honestly, I wasn't that impressed. Sure it stayed true to its name and used most of the ingredients typically found in pho, but nothing about the burger really wow'ed me. I mean, the meat was freshly grounded in-house and overall, it definitely tasted better than your average fast food chain. I'll even give it to them that it was \"interesting\" to eat a burger topped with bean sprouts and basil.. but really, at the price of $6.75 for a petite burger that's smaller than the palm of my hand, I wager I can find a better meal elsewhere. 

The owner was friendly, so service wasn't a problem. 
However, one thing that I really disliked about this place was the seating. They only had 5-6 spaces along the ledge of the wall complete with stools and LET ME TELL YOU, today was my arm day from the way I was forced to eat my burger. The table ledge was placed WAY too high, unproportionate to the stool height, and I struggled immensely with discomfort while eating my burger. I wouldn't consider myself to be too short at a height of 5'3'' so.. beware, my similar-height friends. I looked like a chicken from the way I had to eat my burger. Oh, and I was already sitting at the edge of my stool just millimeters away from falling off of it.

Needless to say, my ability to enjoy the meal was hindered by the uncomfortable position I was in. I highly doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"A small joint on Dundas with a unique twist on a burger. I ordered the 4 oz Pho Burger with fries and a soft drink which came to about $9.00

I love how the burger comes with a cup of Pho for you to have on the side, or to dip your burger in (which I recommend!). The fries were crispy and soft in the middle. 

Service was great, helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. Seating is ample as most order take out. Great place!"}
{"text":"This place is Phobulous and I had the PhoBurger with Kimichi fries. Price is decent compared to your usual Gourmet burger places. $6.50 for the PhoBurger is a steal of a deal. The Meat is Extra Fresh and they definitely put Love in their products. The Kimchi fries were great and for $4.50 worth the price.

It takes about 10 minutes for each PhoBurger to be completed but I can tell you that it is worth the wait. The PhoBurger tasted WonderPho and this place is PhoReal!  They have other options such as your classic burgers, cheeseburgers, Banh Mi Burgers, and Kalbi burgers which I will definitely be back to try.

If you are hungover and craving a Burger and Pho...come here for BOTH and you wont be disappointed. I hope this place stays open PhoEva and never Pho-gets to always put such Photastic love into every yummy Burger they make!"}
{"text":"Was curious to try after reading raving reviews. Yes, it's true. Banh Mi burger itself was worth the walk from my hotel. It was all that as per others have described- nice blend of 'good, tasty, exotic and unique' ness. My only suggestion for them would be to switch to (or let the customers choose) a smaller or thinner bun that can bring out the unique taste even bolder / better. On the other hand, I'm very disappointed with the Kimchi fires. Even if it's stir-fried or grilled, Kimchi should bring out some sour-y taste to indulge your tastebud which could have made this a home-run side menu. However, the non-Korean Kimchi used here makes this item nothing special."}
{"text":"Great and simple concept, well executed. I  gave the kalbi burger a try and was not disappointed. They grind their own beef and pork here, and the sirloin/brisket/chuck combo was spot on. They don't ask you for a temperature on the burger, but mine arrived a juicy medium well, topped with kimchee, sautéed bean sprouts, and house made wasabi mayo kalbi sauce on a great Ace Bakery bun. Delicious. My partner ordered the kimchee fries so I got to try those too. Yum. My only criticism is that the kimchee doesn't have enough bite...I like the spiciness of this Korean staple, and their's lacked fire. I understand that they're maybe trying to appeal to broader tastes, but they could up the chili factor in this condiment. They are currently offering only beef and pork burgers, but I overheard one of the guys behind the counter tell someone that ground chicken will be coming soon. I look forward to it! Very limited seating of 4 bar stools."}
{"text":"Great portions! Fresh mix of flavors! Super friendly staff! Go there before the line up starts going outside the door!!"}
{"text":"What better type if burger to have than none other than a PHO burger. They serve other unique burgers as well but this one was a must try! It tastes exactly like a bowl of Pho and you can get get pretty full from having one on your own. The best part of the burger was the beef that they used. The hoisin and siracha sauce just topped it off! They even served a small sample of their broth soup which was so tasty. It was made cooked to perfection, so much  and tender..it literally melted in your mouth. We also ordered the kimchi fries which didn't taste as good as I expected in comparison to Banh Mi Boys version. The fries were not hot and the mayo lacked flavour.

If you are looking for a quick bite to go, come here and try the PHO burger."}
{"text":"Their Pho burger is out of this world! I'd also highly recommend the Bahn Mi, and Kalbi burgers in that order. The patties have just the right amount of fat, so you don't feel like a grease dumpster after. 

ps Don't forget to order the kimchi fries which are downright addictive."}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing!!! Really - you need to stop by.  Blew me away. Can't emphasize enough how fantastic the food is."}
{"text":"The burgers are EXCELLENT!!! made with great cuts of meat... Try the \"Kimchi Fries\" absolutely fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say: fresh, delicious, and with a friendly smile on the faces of people who make them.  You can tell the care and pride these guys take preparing your order. It is an amazing flavour-dripping burger joint right in my neighbourhood. Amazingly delicious!"}
{"text":"I accidentally ordered a dac beit burger whilst scrolling through my ritual app. The burger was pretty good. They use an egg bun or something like that. I thought the burger was very oily and greasy. My take out bag was literally collecting a little pool of greasy at the bottom. The flavours and ingredients were true to a standard banh mi. I really liked the patty. It had good char and juiciness and thickness but it may have been a bit too salty. The experience was unique and I would be open to trying other Asian fusion burgers from here. I think it deserves a 3.5 but the oiliness dragged out some of the sauces too."}
{"text":"Have walked by Dac Biet Burger a bunch of times and its always caught my eye, having such a unique twist on burgers, that I decided to come here for lunch on a recent Friday.

Walking into Dac Biet Burger, my coworker and I were greeted by the friendly person behind the counter, and asked if it was our first time there. He walked us through the menu and the popular items, and answered any questions we had.

I ordered the banh mi burger (8oz), and a side of kimchi fries.

The banh mi burger was solid. Two big lemongrass pork patties, pickled daikon and carrots, and cucumber, cilantro, and mayo. Taking a bite felt gave me an immediate sense that I was actually eating a banh mi, which the lemongrass pork patties and pickled daikon and carrots really drove home.

The kimchi fries, however, I wasn't completely in love with. There was a decent amount of fries, with the kimchi, pulled pork, and other fixins on top, but it felt like a relatively small amount of fixins, leaving mostly fries, and I even had a few fries that may not have been cooked all the way through.

Overall, a really solid meal at Dac Biet. You get a well made, freshly ground burger, as well as a few interesting choices of sides. However, I found the sides to be on the pricy side, with the kimchi fries clocking in at $5.50, and other options about the same price. Thankfully, the burger is relatively large enough for a satisfying lunch, and it's a unique twist on burgers, so the price for the burgers is reasonable.

I'd definitely go back to try the other burgers (next on my list is the pho burger) but I'd probably just stick to the burgers next time."}
{"text":"If you love freshly made burgers, you should try this place out. This place is a little place on Church Street close to Church and Dundas. It is kind of a hidden gem. I walked by this place many times and never really paid attention to it. I was in the mood for a good burger and decided, lets give this place a try. 
This place is very, very small. There are a handful of seats in side, not good for large groups. It is more of a grab and go burger place. You can pick between 4oz or 8oz burgers for most of their burgers. 
There burger patties are made fresh in-house. They ground their own meat. I ordered the 4 oz Banh-Mi Burger and my boyfriend ordered the 4 oz Kalbi Burger.  I have to say it was delicious! The ingredients were fresh and the flavors was a good balance - it wasn't smothered in sauces unlike other burger places that put way too many sauces in your burger. The meat patties was nicely grilled and flavored. They have another burger called the Pho Burger. I think this would be the next one I am going to try."}
{"text":"Found a little Hidden while walking the dog. If your in the area you have to try the kimchi fries.  It's like poutine, but better. Customer for life :)"}
{"text":"This Banh Mi burger is amazing, make sure someone in your group orders it so you can try. Pho Burger is nice too, full of legit Pho flavours, but if you don't enjoy Pho you probably won't appreciate this burger. Lots of people rave about the Kimchi Fries, they were solidly good but not phenomenal to me. Again though, that Banh Mi burger. Plus the pricing is awesome for value-conscious burger aficionados.

Only minor downside is wait time on burgers, which they have a huge sign on the wall warning you about. It's worth it though as your burger will be fresh. If you need a faster pre-prepped generic burger of lesser quality, try elsewhere. If you want a unique and carefully crafted fusion burger experience then you'll enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 star rating for Dac Biet burger.

I tired both pho burger and the banh mi burger and they both taste as described!

The banh mi burger with the pork patty was juicy, topped with the pickled daikon and carrots, and the splash of siracha.  I think if they replaced it with some finely cut green chili peppers that would be pretty awesome too!

The pho burger was a beef patty that is topped with sauteed bean sprouts, basil, siracha, hoisin sauce, and even a small bowl of the beef noodle soup for dipping.  All the typical things that you would find in a steaming hot bowl of pho.  Although the beef noodle soup jus was a little impractical to be used as a dip for the burger, I think just sipping between mouthfuls works just as well.

You can also get a side of kimchi fries with your burger to round out the meal.

I like their twist on the burger culture in our city."}
{"text":"Had the pho burger and it was amazing! Fresh and flavourful and extremely smart to have the pho jus on the side! This place will definitely become a usual for me."}
{"text":"A hidden gem on Church Street.

I was torn between the Banh Mi Burger and the Pho Burger, however I do not eat pork so the victory went to the Pho Burger. The Pho burger is a beef burger topped with cooked beansprouts, basil, lime, sriracha sauce and a side pho broth. I had on the side Kimchi fries which is topped with Kimchi, aioli sauce and pork (hold the pork).

Pros:
Pho broth is excellent for dipping your Pho burger in.
The Kimchi fries are worth trying (generous portion).
The staff is extremely friendly

Cons:
Small burger
Very little seating

If you are a fan of Vietnamese food and you want to mix it up, than make the trip to 'Dac Biet Burger'."}
{"text":"This is to date my most fav burger joint. Everything is made as soon as the order comes in, so burgers take about 10 mins, but watching my dad wolf down so quickly their plain burger, my mother who isn't a fan of burgers or wasabi go all out for the kalbi burger, and my love of their Banh Mi burger - I wholly suggest everyone try it out once if you're in the downtown core - even if you're not looking for a Vietnamese twist on a burger.

They've now added vegetation options too (sooo good), and their sides look amazing too. Best is that it's quite reasonably priced. And you're taken to flavor country"}
{"text":"We read good reviews on Yelp so we decided to give this place a try. We were NOT disappointed! We arrived just before closing, but were greeted warmly and not made to feel rushed. My husband and I both ordered the Pho Burger. They were out off the banh mi burger, which I would have liked to try.  That was probably due to us being there so close to their closing time though! 
 The pho burger was SO. GOOD. It was served with a small cup of broth to dip your burger into, like a French dip. We also ordered the dac biet poutine, which was loaded with cheese curds, layered with the fries and a pho based gravy. 
 I definitely recommend trying this burger place! You can taste the love these guys put into their food!
 One thing to note is that they don't accept credit cards, so make sure to have cash!"}
{"text":"Great food; renewed my faith in Asian fusion (it's NOT all just overpriced cultural appropriation!) Pretty hard to choose because it's all really good, but in order of awesomeness: banh mi burger, kimchi fries (with wasabi mayo), pho burger (comes with a little cup of pho for dipping!)."}
{"text":"I was in the area and wanted to grab a quick bite, the burger joint was fairly empty at 12 pm, which was a surprise. I ordered the 8 oz Banh Mi burger, which was pretty alright. I got some 5 spicy bbq sauce on the side which definitely made things better. I feel like the Pho burger would have been more flavourful, or at least juicer since its beef as opposed to pork patties."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try their burgers with an Asian twist. 
So we came here on Friday night to grab a \"quick\" bite. It took so long to get two burgers, like good 20min. There were only two guys who were in charge of everything from preparing food to taking orders. Slow service is mostly due to lack of staff. There were only two people waiting for their food when we arrived. After our orders were in, at least three more groups arrived. I felt so bad for those who arrived later because I wasn't sure how long it was going to take for them to get their food. 

I wouldn't be complaining about slow service if food was great. Nothing special to their burgers... small and dry patties and the only thing I could taste was kimchi....(and I am Korean haha).

Overall, I do not see myself going back to this place."}
{"text":"The Banh Mi Burger is A M A Z I N G. It's a Fusion Vietnamese burger. The only pitfall is that you have to have cash, Canadian Dollars to be specific or Debit from Canada. Very nice service  - thank you."}
{"text":"This little burger place on Church Street is fantastic. Coming in with little to no expectations, I was completely blown away by both the Kalbi Burger and the Banh Mi Burger.

Fun fact: The delicious beef is actually prepared on site, and you can really taste the freshness. I'd definitely recommend checking out this place whenever you get the chance. The dudes that own the place are super friendly too, so don't be afraid to give them a shout-out."}
{"text":"Before you pick up any misguided punny ideas with your filthy mind, \"Dac Biet\" translate pretty much to mean \"special\" in Vietnamese. And in this city oversaturated with burger choices, the burgers at Dac Biet are certainly its own unique kind of special.

It's a tiny low-key takeout place housed in a muted and rundown part of Church Street, whose location is merely convenient for the nearby throngs of cash-scrapped Ryerson students. The guy running it is more than enthusiastic to go all the way to please you with his fresh creations, even if it takes an average 10 minutes to make one. The burgers are small, but hey, you're paying way under $10 for one in a town where $15 is the average gourmet norm. What you'll get is a very surprisingly good product that pays itself off at the first bite.

Wait wut, Vietnamese burgers? This ain't no hip Banh Mi Boys type of place, but what Dac Biet have been able to pull off here by turning familiar Viet grub into a burger is almost genius. The Banh Mi Burger is simple enough, but the pork patty they make has the same taste and texture as the meat you'd find in a pork Viet sandwich you'd get at a Chinatown sandwich shop.

Pho in a burger form however? They use the essential ingredients you'd find in the classic noodle bowl as toppings--Thai basil, bean sprouts, dash of lime, along with a beef patty--and it tastes quite like the actual thing. The sip n' dip side of pho broth only adds to the authenticity of the replicated experience. Oh bitch please; it's a hands down must try. After all, pho and burgers are awesome comfort foods, and someone here has figured out how to bring them together in a hybrid awesomeness.

{TTC: use the 505 to Church St}"}
{"text":"Tried their cheeseburger. It was so good! Possibly the best burger I've had in Toronto and one of the best I've ever had in my life. 

The bun was fresh, the beef patty was succulent, the veggies fresh and the sauces perfectly balanced. I couldn't get enough of it. The people there were also super friendly and helpful. Will definitely go back to try their other flavors. Can't wait to have Dac Biet again!"}
{"text":"This new Vietnamese burger joint is excellent! I have been here a couple of times and have gotten the Bahn Mi Burger with pulled pork added onto it. The patties are very tender and full of flavour, and the pulled pork is delicious. This Vietnamese burger concept is superb. It's a perfect combination of Vietnamese and American cuisine. The staff is incredibly friendly too and you can tell that they aspire to please their customers with great food. The wait for the food can sometimes be a little lengthy, but it's not an issue if you're not in a rush (10 minutes max)."}
{"text":"The owner, who left Vietnam at the age of two, combined his love for ph and burger and opened this joint just under a year ago. I highly recommend the bánh mi burger and teriyaki burger..."}
{"text":"I walk by this place every morning on the way to work and the curiosity was just eating away at me; Vietnamese burgers?? I have to try it!

It was difficult connecting the dots; how does one make pho, which is traditionally a noodle soup into a patty? Well, we shall see!

For under $8, I was presented a small pho burger with perhaps a 4-5 ounce patty? It was quite small to say the least but interesting none the less. The burger is served with the tiniest bowl of pho broth one can imagine (maybe twice the size of one of those containers you would use for hot sauce for takeout orders). The owner (a very nice guy) mentioned that I can use it as a dip for my burger; kinda like how some sandwich places where you dip your sandwich in the \"au jus\".

The burger was messy (though he did warn me beforehand). I have no issues with a messy burger granted you should be able to still enjoy most of the sauces and juices. But in this case, every single ounce of sauce(siracha, hoisin sauce) that was put on the burger ended up on my wrapper. I can see how this had happened; the pipping hot patty melts the sauce and all the moisture from the sauteed bean sprouts washed it all away from the burger. Hence, the patty ended up tasting quite dry and somehow the burger was still very mushy (I blame the bean sprouts). The beef however is pretty pronounced and you can tell it's freshly grounded.

So all in all, a very intriguing burger concept but the execution is quite lacking. Does it remind me of Pho? Yes it does, sorta. Is it good burger? There's a lot of work that needs to be done."}
{"text":"I like this place's twist on the burger. I had just ate a small meal at a previous eaterie so I decided to have the Kimchi fries which has wasabi mayo, kimchi and an asian style pulled pork on. And it was oh-so-good! The pork and the wasabi were a good combination that went well with the fries. I savored about half of it and took the rest home. 
Two of my friends shared a Pho Burger and was suggested by the owner to dip the burger in the accompanying soup like a Au Jus Sandwich. I like they like the method of eating.
I'll be back at some point to try out the Ban Mi and the Kalbi burgers"}
{"text":"Tried the Pho burger at lunch. It tastes like pho in burger form, especially with the pho jus. It's pretty unique, I'll be back to try the banh mi burger and pho poutine. 

Only issue is the wait time, it took around 20 mins to get our orders and we just ordered pho burgers. Be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"Tried the pho burger. Definitely unique in comparison to other burgers I've tried. Actually tasted like pho when the burger was dipped in the soup."}
{"text":"OH MAN! this burger was BOMB!  never tasted something like this before.  it was really really good.  i ordered double patty and the amount was good for me.  I think the name of the burger i ordered was pho burger or something like that.  i was having a burger but tasted like having pho and it was AWESOME.It also comes with a side of soup."}
{"text":"Finally got to try out Dac Biet. Had the Kalbi burger and the mix was really good. I enjoyed the sauteed kim chi and wasabi mayo made it verry tasty. The beef patty was quite lean. My preference is for it to be less lean just to get the juicyness. I don't get the lollipop figure for eating lean. :) The place itself is quite small. Can only sit around 5 people. The fact that it takes 15 mins seems to be long as well, but worth the wait. The owners are very friendly. Took the time to talk to their customers. I'm quite a fan. Overall it was a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burger yesterday for lunch after hearing about this place and having passed it numerous times. 

The smell of the food when you walk in is terrific. Ordered the kalbi burger and the kimchi fries. Took 10 minutes for them to cool the burger, as they let you know ahead of time. 

The burger was delicious. The flavours of the meat, bean sprouts and kimchi all went together so well. The wasabi mayo and the Sriracha were also a nice touch. The kimchi fries were also excellent. The fries were nice and crispy, the kimchi, the sauce and pulled pork were great toppings. 

I will definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"Amazing.

I'm not sure i know the right words to describe the food here.  i got the pad thai burger and the wife got the teriaki burger.  They were both unlike anything we've had in the past. I went a step too far in ordering fries that featured wasabi (in decent volumes) which i cannot handle.

The guys there were super friendly and we chatted with them for a bit.  Really rooting for them to be successful - the concept is too delicious to not be shared with the world."}
{"text":"I'm visiting in the area and came across this joint while searching for some fusion foods. Ok I know this is a small joint with only 6 stools but the Banh mi, pho, and Kim chi burger blew me away. I was very impressed with these genius chefs lol. Never would of thought a Banh mi burger (my fav) has a bun like a crunchy exterior French baguette but soft inside like a hamburger bun. Thumbs up to these guys . I'm sadden I can't get this in the US. I will secretly take them back here and cook for us!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered off Foodora (food delivery service) on a late work night and opted for Dac Biet Burger because, when you're at work late, you might as well indulge in a Pho Burger, am I right?! So, full disclosure, I haven't visited the actual restaurant, this review is solely based on the food order they put together for delivery to me.  

I ordered a) the Pho Burger with add-ons of cheese, and bacon, and b) the Kimchi Fries. Overall, fantastic meal! The kimchi fries were wonderfully put together - wasabi mayo, crispy pulled pork, and generous portions of kimchi, really made my meal. The burger was extremely juicy (careful, or you'll get sauce all over you), and really tasted like pho in a burger. Great flavours. Portion sizes are a little on the smaller size, especially when taking into account the price point. But, they aren't so small that you'll go hungry - it's the perfect size.

Service is also incredibly helpful. I had questions about the menu and actually called the restaurant before hitting 'Order' - staff answered my questions patiently and politely. They sounded incredibly busy, but they still took the time to go through the menu with me, even though I wasn't an in-person customer. Really appreciated their approach to customer service. 

For my burger, kimchi fries, with taxes and delivery, my order came to around $21.00 (without delivery fees, it was approximately $17.00). Looking forward to visiting in person one day soon."}
{"text":"Delicious! Don't let the non-flashy storefront scare you. It isn't a hole in the wall either. The burgers are delicious and made fresh when you order. 

We got the pho burger and the kalbi burger with a slide of kimchi fries. All items were delicious. The pho burger comes with some pho broth to sip on or dip your burger in. I liked the pho burger better - the texture was great and if you love pho, you'll love this. It was definitely more unique. The kalbi one was great too though.

They do a single patty (4 oz) or a double patty (8 oz) so you can get a small burger or a bigger one, depending on your appetite! 

Be warned though that there isn't much seating - it's a small place. 

Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"A very unassuming place easily missed from the street but an excellent treat once you're inside.  I would definitely recommend coming here to experience the fresh ingridients.  The only con though is how small the sitting area is unless you order take out"}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers I've ever had. The staff was super friendly, the atmosphere was great and this was easily the most memorable place from my trip to Toronto. The owner says he's got family in New York, and I really hope they open one down here. On a side note: GET THE POUTINE!"}
{"text":"Having driven past Dac Biet Burger several times, I always was intrigued. I don't know many places that serve Pho Burgers. The restaurant is tiny with about 6 spots to eat along the window and the side. I was a little surprised by how slow the two guys working in there moved. I thought, \"how much longer can these guys be in business at this pace\".

Of course they know that because the wall has a sign on it that says they mince their own beef and the burgers take about 10 minutes to cook. So if you're in a hurry, you might get a little frustrated. However, once you do get your food I think you'll be surprised, yet in a good way.

The burgers are crafted with care and the bun holds everything nicely in place. I had the Kalbi Burger and fries and gravy and everything was great! The burger was seasoned perfectly and the meat was juicy (ask for some extra napkins). 

I sure hope these guys figure out a plan to get customers through there quicker. Maybe a little technology would help as it seemed that the guy at the counter was writing everything down on little scraps of paper to hand them to the kitchen. However as far as the food goes, this place is definitely worthy of a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Keeping in mind that they just opened, so I hope they work out the kinks as they further progress into their soft open. 

This place isn't the cheapest burger place in town, plus they are pretty low key.

Few housekeeping items : 
They are currently CASH only. 

Most of the burgers run about $10 after taxes and will probably ring you in at about $15 to $17  after taxes, if you decide to upgrade to a combo (eg, burger with poutine and drink)
.
Their Menu Offerings are definitely interesting. In that I like their offering quite a bit, with Kalbi Burgers and Cha Siu burgers, and a Pho burger on hand. I find that their burger menu is very on point for meeting that middle ground for Asian Fusion gourmet burgers. However, a little time is needed to improve the execution of said menu.

My first visit, I ordered the Kalbi Burger, and it was decent, but the patty was a bit triffle overcooked. But overall, I thought the concept was there, they just need to get the timing right on taking the burger off the grill.

Portion wise - initially I thought the burger, itself, was too small, but as I finished the burger, I discovered the portion size was just about right. If you added on of their Asian-Style poutine, the meal is just enough to keep you full, but not stuffed.

The service is pretty friendly, and they're eager to please, so I'm hoping they stick around.  

Wait time - I would say be prepared to be wait a bit for your burger (approximately), as they put the ground in-house burgers on the grill when you've placed your order. But the staff keeps you updated on your order progress as it cooks."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Dac Biet Burger is an unassuming local burger joint near the famous Sabai Sabai Restaurant on Church Street. They specialize in burgers with a Pan-Asian twist, and the positive reviews attracted me to trying this place.

I came on a Thursday lunch, and the place was relatively busy, although most orders were take out orders. There are only a few seats available, and honestly the seating area isn't exactly the most comfortable out there.

I ordered the Pho Burger, as it looked like something unique and I wanted to try something different. I hesitated on getting fries and drink to make it a combo, but opted to after the wonderful cashier persuaded me on upgrading my meal.

Cooking time was supposed to be 10 minutes, but the chef was pretty efficient and I got my food within 5-6 minutes. The Pho Burger comes with a dipping \"juice\" that looks and tastes more like pho broth. The burger itself was very juicy, and the pho broth was a nice touch when dipping the patty into the sauce. The bean sprouts and basil leaves were a nice complement for that Pan-Asian feel as well. Fries were also large and delicious, and had that high quality potato feel.

Service was excellent, and the cashier came to my seating area a couple of times to make sure nothing was wrong and I was enjoying my food. I would certainly return if I wanted a burger that's not your typical hamburger/cheeseburger style."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for a place called Dac Biet but it was just mediocre... I tried the banh mi burger and the dac biet poutine. The banh mi burger had a nice flavour but there was just too much bun in proportion to the patty and toppings which made the burger overall quite dry. The dac biet poutine had a nice flavour but the gravy was too watery and the fries were not good. The fries were really not good. They tasted like they were stale and they were very dry. I can't say that I would return."}
{"text":"Was in the area for a few days and looking for some unique, quick and tasty food. I popped in for a try and was extremely pleased. I tried the Bahn Mi Burger and I found the balance of flavour, texture, salt was perfect. Really tasty without too much stuff in it, dare I say clean tasting ? :) . Staff was awesome.. like it so much, I returned again to try their Kalbi burger and Kimchi fries... excellent.. and the staff was so great, asked if we enjoyed the food, and genuinely care about the quality they are serving up. Give it a try !"}
{"text":"Oh my lord..this is one of the best burgers i have had in a really long time. The owner was soooo sweeet and def knows his stuff..was a huge chef that left his job to start his own thing. Kudos to him and to every entrepreneur out there :)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal here. At first the price seemed a bit high, but the burgers are a generous size with lots of toppings, and the fries are sizable as well. Friendly staff (i'm guessing the two co-owners)? and an open clean kitchen. 

The menu has a variety of different burgers. 

I tried the Kalbi burger, which involves layering kimchi and wasabi mayo on the buns. Opted to pay the $4 extra for a drink and fries combo. The Pho burger also looks good."}
{"text":"Decided to walk out here in -30°c weather. Totally worth it. Had the Kalebi burger and my gf got the Lemongrass chicken burger. I tried both and OMG pretty freaking awesome! Also got the poutine there, if you like poutine, it's a must have!! 

They're really nice there also!! Everything was awesome ^_^"}
{"text":"Tried the Banh Mi burger - really did indeed taste like a Banh Mi - but burger-y
Very wet - super tasty though. Not sure it was well served by the walk back to work (just a big block). Bun is OK - not French bread, like a banh mi sandwich, but would you want that? Picked veg were really good, and the pork hamburger - cooked perfectly  Lemongrass was subtle but really very good.  Didn't look very big - but was very filling. Be prepared to wait a few minutes - can't wait to try some of their other features - including the Vietnamese poutine. If you want a $2.75 banh mi - visit Tung Hing on Broadview - but for a different, and excellent burger option downtwon, try Dac Biet. Friendly service, and soft launch looks good. Banh mi burger with tax - $8.48"}
{"text":"Fun!  There's 6 or 7 burgers right now. All beef with one pork and soon they're adding chicken.  There's room for 4 or 5 to sit at a counter so you might plan to go. I had the bahn mi with an order of kimchi fries. The bahn mi burger was excellent and it reminded me of the better bahn mi sandwiches I've eaten but this was juicier and the bun was soft and terrific. The kimchi fries were good but the kimchi itself needs work. I've had better everywhere. It's not really spicy and needed more chili. The people who work here were great. If you have a foreign credit card, their machine won't take it and they need to contact their merchant provider.  Great little place and worth a try for sure!"}
{"text":"-Pho Burger (cooked beansprouts, basil, lime, sriracha & hoisin sauce, side pho jus sauce) - $7.50: 
The portion was actually pretty small for $7 and it was just enough for me without filling us up. The burger was served with a side of pho jus sauce and you were supposed to either dip the bun into the broth or just take a few sips while eating. I recommend the latter as the burger was already quite messy to eat with the sriracha and hoisin sauce dripping down. The pho burger had all the toppings of a pho noodle soup (without the noodles of course) - bean sprouts, basil, sriracha and hoisin sauce was not necessary since I'm Northern Viet but it's alright to have it :). The patties were freshly grounded in store daily and they were cooked to medium well and served on a fresh ace bakery bun.

 I can tell you from the get go this broth is AUTHENTIC. It was clear, not too fatty and very flavorful. The burger arrived piping how and it was just incredible! Juicy and delicious, sip some of the broth and it tasted just like eating a bowl of pho. With that said, I would have liked it more if the patty was slightly bigger and if the beansprouts were semi-cooked to preserve some crunch, that would have been nice as I felt the beansprouts were quite soggy."}
{"text":"I tried the cheese burger today and it was very good. The beef was well seasoned and they add quality toppings. I will definitely be back to try different burger types. Excellent service as well. They were very friendly!"}
{"text":"Came here before it was on the Toronto life list. Burger here is not bad. I had the Pho burger and it was actually not bad and it did kinda taste like pho. The texture of the meat itself was a bit strange.. almost too tender, and the burger is a bit too small. The kimchi fries were decent, but nothing groundbreaking. Everyone does some kinda kimchi poutine/fries now. 

The two guys that run it were very friendly. They took my order over the phone so that I wouldn't have to wait."}
{"text":"Got the pho burger.  It was delicious.  First bite I felt like I was eating pho.  The broth on the side tasted very good as well.  Had the kimchi poutine which was a good compliment"}
{"text":"Open late for a quick bite. Amazing burger and fries for a decent price. Original concept."}
{"text":"Just touring around Toronto and stumbled upon this gem.  I ordered a Kalbi burger.  They do have signs that say it will take 10 minutes or so, as every burger is hand crafted. The burger was excellent.  Good meat and a very nice twist on a traditional burger.  Would be 5 stars if they would have accept US credit/debit or converted US dollars at accurate exchange rates.  Ended up costing an extra 30% due to this but hey, good food is good food."}
{"text":"Several weeks ago I planned a little food tour with my buds (first stop was Tacos 101 - review here if you are curious: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/tacos-101-toronto?hrid=gD6F8XLJHZHvCbwXqowHAg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct))

Anyway, our 2nd stop on this tour was Dac Biet Burger, and honestly, I had no idea what to expect. I first ordered the Bahn Mi Burger, but it was not available, so I went with the Pho Burger instead and made it a combo. Since I was doing a food tour, and we had several more stops to go, one of my friends and I split the combo. The burger came with a pho jus, which I knew nothing about. My friend tried to explain to me what its purpose was, and I could not understand why I would want to dip my burger in it. \"So it is not a soup?\" Either way, I did not try it because it was swimming in green onions - and I hate onions. But my friend did, and he told me that there was something different about it. I asked if it was a good or bad different...but he couldn't decide. So he asked the person we believed was the owner or one of them, but he was so overly protective of the ingredients that went into the jus when my friend asked, that he ultimately did not address my friend's question about the jus. Then my friend asked about the meat in the burger, and again, the dude at the counter acted super protective. So odd. We did not want the recipe! Or to learn of the \"secret\" ingredients. We just wanted to know more about the food in general! 

So....

Food: 

I was initially not sure how I felt about the burger...but you know what? It was different, yes, but in a good way. The meat was juicy and the beansprouts and sauce gave it an interesting texture and flavor that I actually really liked. The fries however were average, and would not get again - bland. My other two friends got the kimchi fries and seemed to really enjoy them. The portion was good and the prices were very reasonable. 

Service:

The staff was nice, but a little too high strung. My friends and I love food and to trying new things, but when restaurants act paranoid; it kills the excitement and it makes you want to eat quickly and leave. 

Overall....

I really want to go back and try their regular burger and the Banh Mi Burger. These burgers have interesting toppings, which make it a must try - if for the experience alone. :)"}
{"text":"Must try: Banh Mi Burger

This is such a great treat for fans of anything Asian fusion. The thing I love about it though, is that while it's trying to be creative and innovative in its flavor combinations, it is true to its core as a burger joint: the buns were warm and soft, the beef and pork patty (I will explain again) juicy and properly seasoned, and the uncompromising presence of burger grease. To those modern foodie fad setters out there, I don't mind being experimented on with your wacky creations like deep fried corn or frozen buns, but you have to stick to the root of it and at least do the basics well, which I think dac biet accomplished. Like the owner said himself, \"we have the cheeseburger which is popular too... I guess you can't be a burger joint without a good ol cheeseburger\".

My friend and I did not order the cheeseburger though, we jumped for the Banh Mi Burger and Pho Burger. Both were delicious. The Banh Mi Burger was our favourite for two reasons, the seasoning and the lemongrass/pickled white radish vinaigrette that's all too familiar on a traditional banh mi... and the pork patty. I don't think I have had pork patties before and the texture was so interesting and pleasant. I think it was double pattied but they were not too thick... it was just the right thickness for it to brown and crisp around the edges. Sooo so yummy. The Pho Burger was great too with good beef patties that separate into real meat chunks instead of an indistinguishable lump, plenty on bean sprouts, hoisein sauce and sriracha. I didn't like it as much because it was a little greasy, but that's saved by the pho soup they gave you. You may think that's gimmicky but it definitely helps, it refreshes your palate if you will, besides what's pho without the soup. We also got the Dac Biet poutine, which is supposed to be fries and cheese curds with pho sauce, so as to be more flavorful. Nothing against it except maybe the gravy substitute can be a bit thicker, otherwise you can try it if you want, if you don't you won't be missing much.

The owners are very nice. They engage you in conversation and seems genuinely pleased with what they have created. They seemed down for my suggestion on a chicken burger, saying that's what they have been thinking about as well. I appreciate people who care about what they produce and keep looking for ways to improve and grow. Thank you for having us, it was a great meal.

{"text":"One of the BEST burger I have ever had. This stuff will haunt my dreams now and lead to weekly binges. The Banhi Mi burger is unbelievable. They take pride in their ingredients. Each burger is made to order. I was shocked that on a Thu afternoon it was just my friend and I. Please support them! Pass this on to the students who go to Ryerson. I want this place to do extremely well. It may mean that they will be crowded and there maybe a line up but I will take my chances. Best for takeout as there are only 6 stools. It is a tiny place."}
{"text":"I'm always up for trying new spots, and Dac Biet Burger did not disappoint! They've got a variety of asian-inspired burgers - my girlfriend and I shared the Pho Burger and Kalbi Burger. Both very original recipes that incorporated homemade ingredients! I could see the Pho Burger being one of those things you just CRAVEEE, and will definitely be back for another very soon"}
{"text":"Had the bahm mi burger and it was a perfect combination of 2 of my favourite foods. Get the kimchi fries!! Only place I've been to who layer the fries so every bite was great. Hope this place kills it."}
{"text":"Over the last few years, there has been numerous premium burger spots popping up so trying to stand out is getting tougher. I read a review of Dac Biet and it got me curious to find out if you could get \"Pho\" in a burger.

Location: It is located at Church and Dundas - just south pass Dundas. Inside - the place is super small - it was l-shaped bar area with 2-3 seats. So it is more like a grab and go place.

Food: I was lucky to go with a couple of friends and we each tried a different burger:

Pho Burger - this was my order as I couldn't resist the concept. It was also served with a small cup of soup as well. It had all the toppings of a Pho noodle - bean sprouts, basil and sauce on a soft bun. So I took a bite and wow - it tasted amazing! As I chewed, it tasted like eating beef from Pho noodle plus I took a few gulps of the soup. Great burger - highly recommend!

Banh Mi Buger - my friend ordered this one and he also raved about it as well. Topping had the usual banh mi toppings - I didn't taste it but based on his smile I am sure it was good

Terayaki Burger - also a friend ordered this one and she also loved the taste of if well. 
 
Staff was super friendly as well. I will definitely be returning to check out their other flavours - this burger place is definitely a standout from the rest."}
{"text":"Dac Biet Burger puts an international spin on the city's recent local burger joint craze. What immediately stands out is the focus on flavour, presentation, and meal satisfaction. They offer a few different takes on the classic burgers we all know and love, combining traditional Pho ingredients with delicious 4 oz patties and brioche style buns. The outcome is simply irresistible and also quite unique.

There's room for 6 patrons to sit and enjoy their meal comfortably, though the dining area is bar stool seating only (and not very spacious). It's a nicely designed takeout spot on Church St. (just south of Dundas), making it a decent lunch/dinner option for those in the area. It takes about 8-10 minutes for orders to be ready, but it's well worth the wait.

Must-try items:
Kalbi Burger
Teriyaki Burger
Pulled Pork Poutine
Kimchi Fries

As you'd expect, items like kimchi are included in a few of the burger/poutine dishes. Everything is as intriguing as it sounds, and tastes awesome. There's a cool, hip vibe about this place and they deliver as promised. 

While a burger with 2 patties and poutine/fries could cost you upwards of $20 if you order a combo, most items are well under $10 on their own. The menu is as impressive as it is affordable. The staff are very friendly here. They're definitely one of the better burger shops to open up recently.  If you're a true burger lover, make sure to check this place out."}
{"text":"Solid bahn mi burger, albeit tiny... But it did fill me up on a day where I wasn't extremely hungry. On an average day, I'll probably crave a little more food after eating it. Because of the size, I feel the burger is a little overpriced at $7.80

It takes 10 minutes to prepare, so if you're in a rush, be sure to order ahead of time via apps. The burger was super juicy but is a little messy initially because the heat melts the sauces (mayo, sriracha) - be careful if you're taking out! 

Unfortunately I don't think this will be on my list of \"must try again\". It's not a place I would come to if I'm craving a burger, nor is it the first place I'd go to if I'm craving a Vietnamese fusion sandwich. However, definitely worth trying once."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food. Great friendly service. You like Asian fusion food? Go here."}
{"text":"Got the pho burger & banh mi burger.
Like all other reviews... that pho burger!! Surprisingly delicious; I really didn't think it was going to be as special or delicious as it was, but wow, it was good. Their pho broth au jus is really tasty and on point. 

Takes time for burgers to be grilled & assembled."}
{"text":"Had the pho burger and Kim chi fries. The Kim chi fries had crispy golden fries and delicious home made Kim chi and garlic flavour. The pho burger was quite unique and was tasty"}
{"text":"Came here since my friend was craving for burgers and this popped up on yelp.  I had no clue what kind of burgers they had until I stepped inside.

Then I saw the pho burger so I had to try it. It's cute that it comes with a small cup of pho broth to drink or dip ur burger in.

The burger meat was yummy.  Really soft and the pho burger was the bomb.  The people who work there r nice too. 

Gotta come back to try the rest."}
{"text":"I walked past it randomly while trying to kill time at St Mike's and was really, really pleasantly surprised. I tried the double Pho Burger and it was great! The bread was able to hold the juices while not being too stiff or chewy, and the sprouts & mint tasted great on the burger. The pho broth isn't thick enough to really dip as a jus, but it was nice enough to sip afterwards. 

The two guys there (I think one or both were the owners) were really nice and the prices are very reasonable (I think its like $2 for a small fries)."}
{"text":"I've had the kalbi burger, the pho burger and the bahn mi burger. All were unique combinations that worked great and were equally tasty. However, all of them had the same issue - a tiny thin patty (or two) way overcooked and very dry. They grind they own meat, but whats the point if it's overcooked to the point of being tasteless? Condiments is what makes these burgers unique, but if you're into burgers, then these are nothing to brag about and can have better elsewhere. Still 5* for quality of ingredients, but the patty needs to fixed, then I'll be back"}
{"text":"The people here put a great deal of care into producing some of the best food. Really one of the best burgers I've ever eaten (Pho Burger).  Do yourself a favor and get the Kimchi Fries, they are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I had the 4oz Pho burger with fries, and I definitely liked the cup of Pho to sip on. The burger itself was good, the meat had a distinct taste from your typical burger, mixed in with all the veggie topping you would get in a pho bowl. Fries were solid as well. I'd say the 4oz with fries were just right to have as a quick lunch. 

The one thing that stood out to me, was friendliness of the staff stood out to me for a burger joint. Great people you could chat with as you're having your meal. 

One thing I would caution is that seating space is limited, and that it's not an ideal place to come to with a group of people. For next visit, I would aim to order ahead on Ritual, because they make their burgers fresh, and that they only do cash and debit. 

Overall, definitely provides a unique and delicious experience. Would go back again to try some other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Ordered a Pho Burger and Kimchi fries and was blown away! Food was great, and staff was very friendly.  Was told by the owner that all their burgers are prepared and made from scratch daily, and the end result speaks for itself, burgers are very juicy and full of flavor!  No disappointments here, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is worth trying!  It is recommended to go early rather than later due to fresh ingredients running out. 

I got the Pho Burger and the Kimchi Fries.  The pho burger was amazing!  It literally tasted just like pho.  I had only tried kimchi once and was a bit unsure but these kimchi fries were tasteful!  I loved this place!

I would go back if I travel to the area again and I encourage everyone to give it a shot!!"}
{"text":"Had the banh mi burger. Yum! So tasty and juicy! My friend had the Pho burger and she loved the taste, a bit messy with the sauce but still good!
New stuff coming apparently. Hope they won't get too complicated with the menu. 
Would recommend !!"}
{"text":"What really impressed me was the service. Such genuinely nice people just doing their best to run the shop (and doing a damn good job at it). I'm not even a fries guy and I ate every last one. The bun on the burger is perfect and it's such a fresh taste, I didn't leave feeing heavy at all! The broth is also delicious and a welcome taste to compliment the burger - all in for $11

Amazing!"}
{"text":"The pho burger is aptly named and the staff is really friendly.  I am planning to come back again.  I've never had anything like this.   

Cash and debit only."}
