{"text":"Charmingly awkward! Place is tiny! I ate at the bar with 6 friends... Impossible to have group fun conversation. Guest at the restaurant would be annoyed. We didn't want to bother them with our drunkness and we kept a bit more reserved than usual. Food is alright. Pleasant."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar and watched the chef create masterpiece after masterpiece!  Food was wonderful!  Ambiance was cool.  You can tell that its a neighborhood restaurant and that people go there to see friends,  including the owners,  and to have a good time.  Nondescript location with 5 star food"}
{"text":"Very nice little resto with quality food a great ambiance. Lucky I was there when it wasn't full cause honestly not a lot of space. But for some reason everyone is in the party spirit."}
{"text":"It's not often that every dish at a restaurant makes you swear \"god damn, son of a bitch, that's good\", but the folks at Restaurant Bungalow pretty much hit it out the the park with every single bite: from hummus laden with chorizo & cilantro, to the giant pillowy burratta, to the garam masala dusted fried calamari, to the lobster BLT, to the fork tender grilled octopus, it was all wonderful. 

The folks there made us feel more than welcome - from breaking out the M&Ms when our toddlers got restless to setting up an impromptu tasting menu for the table. 

My only negative thought of the night was \"I wish we would have found this place sooner.\""}

Excellent service,"}
{"text":"Harry and  Nick own and run the perfect neighborhood restaurant!!!
It's an intimate and cozy space with amazing food using the freshest ingredients.  
Dinner for eight last night  consisted of family style Greek salad with chopped grilled octopus, beef and salmon tartars, fried calamari, lamb chop on top of mushroom risotto.  Plus dessert!!!  The only problem about this place is that it's not a walking distance from where I live."}
{"text":"awesome place.

So intimate.
And such good food.

I still think about their Lobsert BLT - lobster on a brioche with cricular bacon and a freshly cut tomato salsa type thing. 

Basically, the chef cooks behind a bar. You watch, you love him and he yells at you. The day i went, he just finished cooking a pork shoulder for 1/2 a day in the oven. When it come out, he came over to have us try it. It was amazing. When i ordered a steak, he told me i was an asshole (jokingly).

Great place, and the duo owners do a good job pleasing their clientelle.

Thankful my friend introduced me to this place."}
{"text":"We couldn't have asked for a better experience at Bungalow for our first dinner in Montreal.  We walked by and it had a great lively yet intimate feel right from the get go.  Luckily, there were 2 seats left and we snagged them and had an incredible time.  As soon as the waiter discovered we were American the chef came over to assist us with the menu that was written on the wall.  I can read french (mostly food items) pretty well so that was not a problem, but it was still wonderful that we had that interaction.  The food was fantastic-- you must get the lobster BLT and the hummus/chorizo dish.  Also, it was so fun to be in a restaurant that truly felt like 30 friends having a good time, lots of laughter and GREAT music!"}
{"text":"Quite good and nice and small, the open kitchen is lots of fun and the staff are awesome. Just had 3 entrees, all were solid though the use of arugula in all three was not ideal. Great wine selection. Definitely worth a try."}
