{"text":"Some of the best Fried chicken I had \" and the girls working there are so nice and helpful \" even under pressure lol when they have a long line of people trying to get this good chicken 

And I must say the guy I seen helping in the chicken side he is one of the cleanest I saw him wash his hands dry them and put Gloves  on after every order \""}
{"text":"I've been inside the Chevron gas station for other things and never gave the chicken a second look. Today a co-worker and I were talking fried chicken and she told me about this place. THE CHICKEN HERE IS DELICIOUS! 

This chicken can stand up to any fried chicken restaurant and it fact, it may be BETTER!

You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Excellent Chicken. As close to southern home style as you can get. Very friendly staff. Have gone back 5 times to stock up!"}
{"text":"I just went here today. The place was packed, granted there is not a lot of space or seating inside this Gas Station Mini-Mart. This is the only KKC in Las Vegas. I have tried all of the other Major Fried Chicken Restaurants(KFC, Popeyes & Churches). I think overall, I still like Churches the best. The Good: I loved their Potato Wedges/Fries & their chicken was favored nicely. What was just okay was, their Mashed Potatoes, Jambalaya & Honey Butter Biscuits. They are worth checking out, especially if you like KFC's Extra Crispy style chicken. They have the thickest batter of any of the chains & I kinda like that."}
