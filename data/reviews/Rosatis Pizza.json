{"text":"I keep trying this place cuz the pizza is decent. However thus was the last time. Told me my pizza would be here in an hour it wasn't. I called after an hour and 15 mins later they said it was on it's way. 2 hours and 15 mins after I placed my order I called again. They said it was sitting there at the restaurant waiting for me to come get it! Why would they need my address and credit card info if I was picking it up? I told them delivery and they just made excuses. Never again."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Rosatis for over 10 years.  Tonight's pizza was absolutely terrible.  No taste, cheese dry and yellow instead of white. Sauce tasted like tomato sauce out of a can.  I also had chicken tenders.  Had to use 3 paper towels to blot the oil out of them.  If the weather wasn't so bad I would have returned the food and demanded a refund.  WHAT HAPPENED?  C'MON GUYS"}
{"text":"Wow, this place should get an award for having the worst food ever. This food is literally worse than anything I've had in my life. It should be called Rosatis Half Cooked Grease Pot...to call it pizza is a bloody joke and their \"marinara\" tastes like vegetable soup, what sort of pizza sauce tastes like vegetable soup!? Whoever gave this place good ratings needs to reevaluate their life and eat places that actually have good food, and I'm far from a food snob. Literally dominoes is better than this hole, and it's half the price and you won't be disappointed in their sub par food!
:D"}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever !!!!!!! The dummy behind the phone claims Stan the manager was not in , I ordered lasagna and an antipasto salad , paid with cc and left a 5 dollar tip for driver , driver gets here gives me my salad and what I thought was my lasagna , WRONG , I get someone else's order , so I call and she totally doesn't understand what my problem is and finally through some ray of hope Quincy she claims to be she finally gets it !!!!!! And her only solution is she can have them make me a new one and it would be over an hour to receive the second one , or a credit !!! It's now 8 pm really !!!! You can't take suggestions like call your driver and bring me my food and take back the wrong order !!!!!! Realllly!!!!!!!! Sooooo... Get this after telling her fine get me another order , knock knock ...... It's the driver , he apologized and I told him the hell Quincy put me through with her all I can do's and he said no one called me ! That's all they had to do , why didn't they just call me !!!! Well moral of the story is she will always amount to nothing and work there forever and I will never order from there again and I will make it my life's mission to tell people about Quincy and the missing manager Stan"}
{"text":"Was it a bad day or is it crazy
I had a groupon certificate for 18.00 value. I had called and asked what they had going on that night. They told me an extra large one topping and get a small cheese free. I had ordered it and went to pick it up I paid the difference with my certificate and took home a great set of pizzas. A few weeks later my girlfriend gave me her certificate for the same place. When I called he looked up my number and saw the deal I had before. I repeated the order and went to pick it up. When I got there I gave the owner the certificate same as lat time and that is when things went wrong. He said that I had to pay for the cheese pizza. I told him this is the same thing I had ordered a few weeks before with the same deal. He again said I owed him 12.00 more for a small cheese pizza. I explained I did not have the extra money and would not have ordered it. He said I did order it and owe him. I again said that I can not afford that for a small cheese pizza. He yanks the pizza from the stack and throws it into the back cooking area smashing into pots and pans making a crashing sound. The staff from the back run out to see what is happening. I stand amazed and say you didn't have to do that. He yells back at me ITS MY PIZZA I CAN DO WHAT I WANT WITH IT. He is so worked up that he gives me to much change back which I return to him. No thanks just rage and anger. I was sad and when I contacted corporate in Chicago they explained that he is not part of their company. The name is the same the food  and menu is too. So he is on his own and does what he wants. So if you are up for a freak show feel free to come in and see the owner act out like a child in a temper tantrum."}
{"text":"We just moved to the Surprise area and wanted to try out local pizza places. We got a menu in the mail from this place so we gave it a shot. Delivery took over an hour for just one pizza and one order of cheese sticks. The pizza was not good and all it was a simple pepperoni and cheese thin crust. Most likely will not reorder from this place again."}
{"text":"Four of Canadian women were down for golfing and picked up a pizza for supper.  It was the thickest and most flavorfull pizza we have had.  The extra sauce on top made it wonderfully tasty.

All four of us are thumbs up about the pizza.  It was so filling it lasted us a couple meals.  Bravo!!"}
{"text":"This used to be the best pizza in the valley.  The last two times we went we were disappointed.  The first time the pepperoni had no flaver.  This last time the italian sausage had no flavor.  The basic pizza is still good."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but the service is slow and friendly to slow and rude.  It just shouldn't take an hour to get out a chicken parm or a couple of pizzas.  If it truly is a busy night and you actually do need an hour to make my food, tell me!  Don't tell me 30 minutes and then start my order when I get there!  Then, when you've screwed up (again!) and I'm waiting on an uncomfortable little bench in a hot, cramped waiting area no bigger than a closet, offer me a drink, or something off my bill or what have you.  Don't act like it's my privilege to be there."}
{"text":"4 words sum it up.  Chicago Style Deep Dish.  This is as close as it gets in this town and you've gotta give them 5 stars for that alone.

I've never understood why nobody does it right out here.  Its not the water no matter what they say.  

They don't have sausage patty but the crust is great and the za is super tasty.  If you're done with the artisan style or you just need a good old fashioned \"comfort food meal\" than go with the Chicago style.  It'll do the trick."}
{"text":"We've been going for years. Rear pizza and lasagna. We've never had a problem with pickup."}
{"text":"1 hour for pick up, $44 for 2 \"extra large\" greasy pizzas!   Pass next time and hit Pizza Hut or other for a real extra large and better service!"}
{"text":"Granted I've never eaten at the location the other reviewer is talking about and the deep dish isnt as good as the true Chicago style you'd get in Chicago itself but the pie does deserve more than just one star.

We order the deep dish every once in a while and it always tastes delicous. The regular pizza's are very good too."}
{"text":"Our delivery was 20 min passed when we were told it would arrive. I called twice, 2nd call spoke to a gentlemen who could careless about our order. Said he could credit my account $10, for our next order after I had to ask what was going to be done. He didn't even apologize. He let me know we were the 3rd delivery. So of course we got cold pizza, warm wings and soggy bread sticks by the time the order arrived, yum! :/
I would recommend some better customer service. It's a good thing you have a reputable name on your building."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting and way over priced for the food and service you get. The pizza has no flavor and the wings were almost raw even after I asked for them to be crispy. They said my order would be ready in thirty minutes but when I got there 40 minutes later I still had to wait 20 minutes. I definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Two stars because the over priced Chicago style pizza was decent. If I rated it based on the chicken parm it would be ZERO. Ordered it, went to pick it up...15 'min after my scheduled finish time...it still wasn't done. Then when we brought it home it was like mush, the chicken was obviously breaded then just baked with the noodles and sauce...the bread crumbs slid off. It literally was not even edible. The staff is friendly when u call...even though I mentioned to the guy there was a coupon which he said there wasn't and lo and behold there was actually a coupon in the bag... Won't be back which stinks since they are right by my house."}
{"text":"This is a hard place for me to review.

Usually when I order from them I enjoy their pizza (its definitely a step up from the big national chains like Papa John's or Domino's) and this is why I call them back, but unfortunately they seem to be fairly inconstant at this location (which is the only one I have tried). There are times (maybe 15-20% of the time) when I order that I find myself fairly disappointed with their pizza. On those occasions the pizza just seems to be more bland and not quite on point. I am not sure what happens those times but it happens enough that I am mentioning it on here.

Overall I would probably rate them with four stars if it wasn't for the inconsistency. 

Despite the inconsistency, I still put them clearly ahead of the big national chains and order from them when we are in the mood for pizza."}
{"text":"I just ordered the deep dish pizza and it was great. I cannot say the same for their cheese fries. But the tomatoes taste like they are homemade."}
{"text":"Food: (When it's hot, fresh, and cooked as requested) 5 stars
Service: FAIL

I finally found my Chicago style pizza. I LOVE their pizza.

If you order during the week for dinner, you should be okay with delivery times.
If you order for lunch, forget about getting your food in a timely fashion, it won't happen. Our estimated delivery time was 45 minutes. I called after an hour to see if our order was lost or something. The manager said they were running behind, but my order just left and I should receive it in a few minutes. We live about 10 minutes away if you hit every red light. It took another 45 minutes to get our food, it was warm at best and prepared wrong. I got a refund.

When we ordered again, I had my fiance pick it up to avoid delivery times. Perfect pizza.

The last time we ordered we were estimated 55 minutes delivery time, again, almost 2 hours later our food finally showed up. We wrote an e-mail (same as the first incident) about the issue, but haven't heard back 5 days later. Needless to say, no matter how delicious the pizza is, we will not be returning business to this location."}
{"text":"A taste of home!  Perectly made pizza with authentic italian sausage and lots of sauce and cheese.  My favorite pizza anywhere.  Eat here and find out why Chicago has the best pizza!"}
{"text":"Apparently, they are not all the same, but the location on Warner on McClintock is my favorite pizza of all time! Get the thin crust MOP -- my fave"}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza with italian sausage is always good and worth the price.  We're not paying for a lot of dough and low quality toppings.  Toppings are excellent.  Order is always ready on time."}
{"text":"They say you get what you pay for. With this place it certainly isn't the cheapest but the pizza is pretty top notch."}
{"text":"Its good pizza....We have  a Rosatis in vegas but it didnt taste the same....maybe i am used to my local Rosatis but the deep dish had too much tomatoes and thin crust was not as crispy...overall the pizza was still better than others we have tried in the Phoenix area....."}
{"text":"The pizza is good IF/WHEN it is delivered expeditiously.  The problem we typically have are long delivery times.  When this happens our pizza shows up luke warm to cold."}
{"text":"I was SOO hoping that Rosati's would deliver with great, Chicago style pizza.  I was very disappointed in the end result.  My husband and I orderd a large garden salad that came with iceberg lettuce, 6 tomato chunks, a few cucumber slices and some green pepper.  The croutons and dressing were prepackaged and not made in-house.  It was definitely not worth the $5-6 they charged for it.  I was totally willing to overlook the salad when the pizza came out.  It looked delicious!  It had a thick crust, lots of cheese and pineapple and ham, but after the very first bite we were both very disappointed.  The crust was weird-it was not chewy or doughy like regular pizza dough. It tasted like crusty bread from the grocery store.  The pizza sauce was runny and had absolutely no flavor to it at all.  The pineapple was canned, so it was a little hard and I could barely taste the ham.  I LOVE pizza, we eat it once a week, but I only ate one piece of pizza and I can honestly say, that has never happened in my life!  Save your money and find your Chicago style pizza elswhere, it was definitely not happening at this Rosati's!"}
{"text":"Had a Groupon and the rosatis next to my house wouldn't honor it but this one on Gilbert location would.  I ordered a spicy italian beef sandwich and deep dish pizza.  When I brought it home I discovered they gave me the regular beef sandwich instead...oh well it was still good but the pizza unfortunately was undercooked, soggy and mushy.  Cheese wasn't melted and was inedible.  My daughter who loves pizza wouldn't eat it.  I called and asked for manager and she said she was.  I explained what happened and she said thanks for the feedback and hung up.  Won't be cheap next time and will go to the good Rosati's on Alma School."}
{"text":"My first review ever...
My first pizza was delivered wrong, second pizza had a giant hair in it...Then waited 3+ hours for the right pizza to be delivered. I finally just drove to the store and cancelled my order and asked for my money back. As a small business owner myself this was incredibly frustrating...If you are the owner of this store you should probably get a little more involved..."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this location for years! NEVER AGAIN! Found a piece of hair practically cooked inside of the pizza! I'm disgusted! I've never seen anything more disgusting! So disappointed! Not only that but when they answer the phone to take orders they are so rude."}
{"text":"Our family has ordered pizza from this location for over 25 years and is the best! A true Chicago treasure right here in Tempe. The staff and owner are awesome."}
{"text":"I've lived in Tempe for over thirteen years and have been ordering pizzas from this location since moving to Tempe from Ahwatukee. I've never had a bad pizza from the Ahwatukee location (Lived there 6 months.) nor the Tempe location. On average we order Rosati's pizza from this location at least every 3 weeks or so. We save the coupons from the boxes so we've had a lot of pizzas for half off over the 13 years of being a customer of the Tempe location. Our favorite pizza has been the Gonzo (Pepperoni, spinach, green olives.), we are currently ordering double pepperoni, double spinach, onions and black olives. Same quality for over 13 years. And no I have not received any compensation for this review - just wanted to submit an honest review."}
{"text":"ok so i didnt order pizza but i ordered mango habenaro and hot wings, cheesy garlic bread, jalapeno poppers, fries and onion rings. it came 15 minutes late, everything was room temperature and soggy.. the wings are breaded which i didnt expect granted the flavor of the wings are awesome! also i noted to not ring the door bell as it was 11pm when it showed up and my 1 yr old was sleeping. the driver disregarded my note and rang the door bell anyways and woke my son up. if i would have did dine in im sure it would have been great. but delivery late night not so much...."}
{"text":"First time ordering here......and last.  Terrible value for unimpressive food.   We ordered takeout and we live literally around the corner, so it should not have been cold.   For $6 we got a fast-food French fry-sized bag of overcooked, flavorless fried zucchini.....a total of 10 slices of zucchini, and they forgot to include the ranch dip we ordered with it.  The $24 pizza was just so average.......I only ate one slice and did not want any more.  And the order of lasagna was good, but at $11 for a 5 x 5 piece???  Can't see paying that much.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"This pizza is complete crap! Not cheap either. The pizza was like flatbread and it tasted like cardboard. Yuck!"}
{"text":"My first time ordering from this place. It was delicious! Cheese, black olives, tomatoes. Was not disappointed, we will definitely be ordering take away regularly."}
{"text":"The tempe location opens at 11am. I called the store at 11:05 spoke to a gentleman about ordering a few pizzas and drinks for a company function and needing it to be delivered AT 12:00PM Sharp. The location for delivery was less than 2 miles for the store location. At 12:20 I called asking for an update as the pizza still had no arrived only to be told it typically takes 1 hour and 15 minutes for deliveries. When I asked why I wasn't told that on the phone during the order (I would have ordered from somewhere else) the man just said, ya sorry about that. So $100+ order placed right when they opened, didn't get delivered until 12:30PM. If you need an order by a specific time, definitely don't order from them without a 2 our notice. Our client was so pissed."}
{"text":"Best Chicago style pizza you can get in town. We always get the meat lover's for pizza night. If you like really good pizza, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The manager Stan is a joke. Had a horrible attitude with me because I asked for my pizza to be redone since my first was burnt and stale. When my husband went back to get them he witnessed the manager yell at another customer \" look at this .... now is this good enough for you?\" He thought the woman was me! Then we watched as he yelled at his employee for trying to help him. Bottom line sucky food high prices and HORRIBLE service."}
{"text":"The last few times that we ordered food Delivery from Rosatis they gave us a burnt Pizza once, the wrong Pizza once which they ended up giving us along with the actual pizza we ordered. Then we ordered a family size Linguini Alfredo and it was super oily with no flavor at all... Strike three as they say! We only order from Rush Street Pizza now. Their Pizza is my new Favorite!"}
{"text":"Currently eating salad with my fingers, while the family eats cold, greasy pizza, because even though they're 1.7 miles away, it takes over an hour to deliver a cold pizza... and apparently 30 minutes to get a fork \"right out\".  Thanks for the reminder of why we don't waste $40 freaking dollars on your nasty, cold crap... good thing it was so late, we were so hungry, no choice but to eat it. #rosatis #sucks! (For the guy who asked why I didn't have a fork... I was on a construction site... working my ass off in a vacant house. So no... I didn't have a fork.)"}
{"text":"It is good at times.  They are inconsistent.  They could improve their employee training or supervision.  When cooked properly, their pizzas taste good, but are excessively oily for some reason."}
{"text":"LOVE THEIR PIZZAS!! Like eating Chicago style in AZ! I am picky too since I have had the real thing in Chicago. Good flavored sauces."}
{"text":"Greasy and just gross. The delivery was also over an hour late. 1st and last time for this place"}
{"text":"I ordered a pepperoni pizza and didn't realize it was a cheese pizza until I reached my destination. I mention the mistake to them the next day and all I got was \"it's ok the cheese pizza is good.  Ill fix it next time.\"  Customer service 50/50"}
{"text":"Yummy stuffed pizza. The sauce is tasty, has a nice zip to it, and is not bland at all. Have only gotten the stuffed pizza with spinach and tomatoes here. Arrived to the house still piping hot. Mmmm...reminds me of Chicago..."}
{"text":"How do you rate a place that has been so bad for so long.  High prices for mediocre pizza and long wait times to boot.  They just raised their already high prices even higher.  Lack of any care at all from the people taking the order to making you wait \"cause its coming right up\" for more than 20 additional minutes as they find your order and make it in front of you.  Nope...never again."}
{"text":"This is a go-to  place for me for take out.  Their pizza is great and the chicken parm dinner is one of the best.  Tonite, tho, I decided to try the lasagna.  The food was decent, but the attitude of the girl that took my order and cashed me out left a little to be desired."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill faster than a triple black diamond at the ski resort. Screwed up my order by putting a small pizza into a large box. Nice try. They fixed it. Then i ordered 3 sandwiches. All 3 were wrong. Never going back. Obviously nobody pays attention."}
{"text":"Great Chicago style pizza. Good pasta and ribs and sandwiches. Delivered hot and fresh to your door. What could be better? If you only like New York style pizza you will not understand the thin crust cut in squares goodness that we ate as kids in the mid west. Try it. It's a different thing. I like the NY style. I get folding it and eating it. Who doesn't like a big soft chewy piece of pizza ? In the mid west we groove on a thin crispy crust. Little meat ball chunks of sausage and green, yes green olives. This is the style Roseti's sells. Don't put it down. It's so good! And these guys have the best I've tasted in the Phoenix area. And you can order it online!"}
{"text":"This place is simply great. Cardboard pizza is fine for the kiddies, but as you grow up and your tastes get more refined, you go looking for something better. Rosati's is BETTER. A whole LOT better. 
Rosati's sits somewhere between a mom & pop specialty joint, and a mega chain - but more the former than the latter. They have enough stores scattered around a few states to get some economies of scale, but they certainly don't feel anything like a mega-chain.
Let's face it, there are a zillion pizza joints in the world. And most of them claim to offer fresh ingredients and \"authentic\" whatever. In fact, there are no less than FOUR pizza places a stones throw from THIS particular Scottsdale corner!  The problem is that most of those zillion joints put out pizza that taste just like all the rest of the pizza you've ever eaten. OK - but nothing really distinctive and memorable.
That's where Rosati's is unusual. 
Their pies have an almost buttery/savory undercurrent that just tastes FABULOUS. It's certainly a traditional taste - but somehow amped up to put a smile on your face. 
One caution, avoid the\"trick\" pies like the double crust thing. My advice is to stick to the original crust and even tho this isn't a discount joint, order a size LARGER than you think you might want. You'll thank me the next day.

Oh, and take out/delivery only. The couple of seats are set up for waiting customers only."}
{"text":"This is a place to avoid.  They have the worst pizza crust I have ever had. We've ordered it twice just to be sure it was as bad as we thought it was, and it was!

We've tried ordering some of their sandwich selections as well, and they'll do in a pinch, but today I ordered an Italian sausage with sweet peppers, that they charge .50 extra for and then are very stingy with them. The sausage was nothing to get excited about.

My fiance ordered a Italian beef sandwich and said it's just missing something...

So I don't think we'll be going back here again...We've given it a fair chance, and the help is really rude. They don't say hello, goodbye, thankyou...nothing."}
{"text":"Reluctantly!!! We just ordered pizza and chicken wings from Rosati's, Tempe. The last pizza was HORRIBLE!!! We thought we'd give 1 last try because we had some box tops for half off? We noticed we had a missed call from Rosati's? We thought it was to confirm our order. But it was a rude guy claiming his name was Scott claiming he was the owner and how did we collect 10 box tops?  We told him, \"by buying pizza?\" He was rude and sounded like a drunk from the hood? Maybe this guy is having money problems or something? Do yourself a favor and AVOID SCOTT and all locations of Rosati's Pizza as this Scott guy was very unprofessional and If he is the owner we suggest he spend his time at AA, trying to make pizza,  and trying to get his customer service up to par from a ZERO! If we could give Rosati's a ZERO STAR we would!"}
{"text":"After trying out several pizza places in our area, Rosati's has become our regular pizza place for takeout or delivery for a thin crust pizza (we also like Spinato's Pizza).

The crust is thin and crispy and the toppings are plentiful. I can't comment on other types of pizza because we haven't ordered anything other than the thin crust.  I have ordered a variety of different toppings on our pizzas; we have never been disappointed.  

They run specials on a regular basis. It's worth asking about which specials they are currently running.  

The only negative thing I can think to say is that we recently ordered their mild and hot wings.  They were both awful.  The universal consensus was that they weren't good because they had a mushy texture.  I felt like the mild wings were too hot.  Most guests thought the hot wings weren't hot enough.  No one liked the wings."}
{"text":"Picked up dinner for the family on the way home one night with a Groupon. If I hadn't gotten a map with my Groupon, I don't know as I could have found this place on my own. Completely overshadowed by an Applebee's, it's tucked into the main part of the shopping center on the south side of Baseline and Alma School, with a neon sign that simply says \"Rosatis\". It also seems to share a kitchen and dining room with another restaurant-South American? 

I opted for a thin crust (I typically prefer Pan or Chicago style deep dish, but didn't want to wait 30-40 minutes), and my only complaint was it seemed to have too much cheese on it. I know, I know, who doesn't like extra cheese-for free? Would have been better if the cheese was brown all the way across the pizza-the extra cheese made the center pieces (it's cut in squares, for the uninitiated) soggy and hard to pick up. 

Good pizza, regardless-plus it's on my way home. Groupon makes it a little more affordable (Extra large classic combo pizza runs 27 bucks without one), and they have dine in, which the one near my house (24th st and Baseline) does not. Might try the restaurant next door also (or in the same door, however it works there). I'll drop a review on that one too."}
{"text":"My family has been coming to this location since the 80s.  It's always been great.  This is one of the \"original\" Rosati's locations, so you know the type of quality to expect. It's never been cheap, or fast, but great pizza never is. I occasionally do delivery but usually get takeout and use coupons when I can.  Their thin crust pizza is awesome.  So is their Italian beef.  My favorite has always been their deep dish, although my family is old school and likes it with the cheese on top - like God intended.  For the people that complain about speed, this isn't fast food.  If you want Little Caesars, go get it.  Otherwise your patience here will be rewarded with great pie. Many of the franchise locations give Rosati's a bad name,  but this, as an original location is worth checking out for excellent Chicago style food."}
{"text":"Food was good but they WAY over sell.    I ordered pizza and salad for 12 and could have fed 30 or more....disappointing that they are not honest.  Could have spent half as much."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was substandard. We showed up before 8:30PM, and placed our order for dine-in. Then as we were sitting down the girl came out and told us that dine-in was not available, only carry-out. The sign on the door said they are open until 9PM.  I asked why dine-in wasn't available, and she just said that the owner wasn't there and that they don't allow dining in after 8:30P.  We decided to just get it to go, and not make waves.  I would hate to see what would have happened to my food If I argued about it.

While we were waiting for our \"carry-out\" meal, a customer came in, and while he was getting ready to order. The girl behind the cash register said, \"We are only serving take-out right now, not dine-in.... and we are open for three more minutes.\" It was only 8:50PM. The customer just turned around and walked out. Obviously they were eager to go home on time and did not really care about their customers."}
{"text":"Everyone recommended this pizza to me 5 years ago when I moved here from Chicago. I tried it then, hated it, and never gave it another chance. Yesterday I figured I'd give it another shot, since the first time I just had a slice of their thin crust. I ordered the stuffed with green pepper and pepperoni. The entire experience was great. You can't order online for this location, but the girl who took my call was quick and efficient. The delivery arrived 45 minutes after I called, which was exactly what I was told. The pizza was delicious, even my very picky boyfriend enjoyed it. I will definitely be ordering from this Rosati's more often!"}
{"text":"This place should be closed down.  The smell in there is horrible.  The food taste as bad as it smells.  The calzones are a joke so much bread and all the toppings fall out of the gaping whole on the bottom of the crust.  The crust was so tasteless.  Also beware on the menu it says they have perch fish however it is not perch but cod.  They won't bother to tell you unless you ask.  I don't know what happened to this place I used to love it. I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Went to this new location to take advantage of a groupon i had just bought, it's not a restaurant just a pickup little shack with no AC!!! In july, really? As soon as i walked in I walked out, not worth it."}
{"text":"Service getting worse. Tonight they over charged me by $6 for one pizza and in top on that it was cold. I will not be good back. Try Buddyz in Queen creek. It is our new favorite."}
{"text":"I don't know what people are complaining about.  There are different styles of pizza and most of the people with issues here seem to have not known which type to order.  If memory serves: the thin crust is very thin and crispy, then there's the double-dough and then pan pizza which is Chicago-style (in which case the sauce is supposed to be served on top).  Normally, we get the thin crust pizza which is very tasty, but when I'm allowing myself to have \"piggy day,\" I get the deep dish which is SOO good!  I haven't tried the double dough.  
I'm guessing that the people with the crust complaints either didn't order the pizza they intended to or they were misunderstood (which isn't a great thing to have happen, but it does happen in life).

Overall, for pizza in Surprise, my first pick is NYPD, but Rosati's is very doable.  My only gripe is that they are a bit pricey, even with coupons."}
{"text":"Now that I found out they deliver, my family has ordered 4 times in the past 2 weeks. Great cheese pizza great chicken parm very happy with everything I have ordered."}
{"text":"It's my delivery go to when I am in AZ for work.  They are always friendly and timely and they have always gotten my order right.  The main reason I order from them is the deep dish pizza.  We are talking true Chicago Style deep dish.  I love when the delivery person says \"be careful, it's heavy\".  For the price it is an excellent value.  Get the large, and you will have enough for dinner tomorrow. Really enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Poor service! Pair that with a pizza that tasted liked tomato sauce on a cracker (a VERY salty cracker) and you get one star......and bad indigestion."}
{"text":"Rosati 's has the best pizza around.  Service is great in house or delivery. Unfortunately they are pricing themselves so far above the competition that feels like they are a bit greedy which makes me feel like I am being taken for my money. No one likes to feel that way.  You have coupons but still to high priced."}
{"text":"We order two pizzas on a Saturday evening and when we arrived to pick it up they had lost the ticket!  There was no apology and had to ask for a refund as we had already paid no offer to get it ready or anything just a \"we lost the ticket\". Typically not a bad experience but after this visit we will not be back, switching to the further away restaurant on Alma School!"}
{"text":"I don't go anywhere else for Italian anymore I live in Ahwatukee and drive to Mesa for the amazing Italian dishes they serve here. And their cannoli & cheesecake? forget about it! freakin' amazing. You must put this neighborhood Pizza & pasta stop on YOUR bucket list. I eat here about 2-3 times a week, and I run another restaurant, but would rather eat here. Say hi to Erik the manager and sit back and enjoy a delicious meal."}
{"text":"This is separate (not the same owners) as the Ray & McQueen location and the Warner and McClintock...has to be because the  method of making the deep dish pie was totally different and even the crust was different.  Cheese on top, so it was OVERDONE.  No where near as good as the pie at the original dine-in location at Ray & McQueen.  If you are craving deep dish from Rosati's, go to Ray & McQueen."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place since it is our closest pizza option.  I ordered on grub hub and went to pick up my pizza when the app said it should be ready and the first guy I talked to couldn't find the order and just walked away and went to the back.  A girl came up and looked some more but said she couldn't find the order.  I showed her the email from grub hub showing I ordered it for the correct location.  She offered to make a pizza in 20 minutes but no discount or anything else offered.  We left and went to Mod Pizza.  I doubt I'll be returning for a second try."}
{"text":"First off my wife and I love Rosatis pizza, we have been regulars from different locations and we had never had a problem until we moved to south chandler and this location was the closest one. 
We have had four different occasions where something has been wrong, from little things like paying for ranch and never receiving them, burnt rubbery cheese, not cut all the way through, wings that had sporadic sauce, etc. I listened to my wife order a pizza for delivery and after an hour and a half I called and asked about our pizza. I was rudely told that we in fact did not and he kept arguing the point. I listened to her place a delivery order, but regardless an employee should not talk to a customer like this. We ended up going to pick it up because we did not want to wait and got the same pizza that was sitting now for two hours. We have given up on this location and if we are really craving Rosatis we will drive to a further location."}
{"text":"Being from the Chicago burbs was very familiar with Rosatis.  We have patronized this restaurant since they arrived in Surprise.  Good staff, friendly, and pizza is good.  Italian Beef is great...only down side is they have become rather pricey.  Due to that we do not patronize them as often as before. 

This is a carry out business only.  Only open for lunch certain days."}
{"text":"Ordered here many times but service has dropped dramatically. Told 30 minute for pickup. It took 70 minutes! But any Grubhub pickup was ready & waiting for their drivers. 
Any patron told me her experience was the same or worst. Don't ask for the manager. He never came to the counter to talk with us after we expressed our dissatisfaction."}
{"text":"There are many pizza joints out there, but few compare to Rosati's. classic Combo thin crust is the absolute best. Prepared with a little crisp on a few edges, it is the best comparison to a \"combination\" pizza; sausage, lots of cheese, green peppers and black olives. It's the best!! I have heating up pizza, but THIS pizza heats up magnificently! The staff is so dedicated to smile and be polite. Nice and cool restaurant. Clean and tidy. You'll pay $20 for a 12\" of perfection. WORTH EVERY PENNY! Thanks Rosati's!!"}
{"text":"There's a reason why they have to offer discounts on Groupon. Placed an order for pickup at 3pm on a Friday. The order was supposed to be ready at 3:40. Arrived at 3:45. 
First of all, the girl at the cashier didn't know how to ring up a Groupon and instead of the other workers offering help, they just yelled at her from the back for a good 5 minutes.
We wait for 20 minutes for our pizza. The guy comes out and says he messed up our pizza and it would be 5 minutes while he remakes it. 15 minutes later, still no pizza. 
So here we are, 4:23, no pizza. I would like to add to add that there is only 1 other person in the restaurant.
He added a credit to the account for the trouble, but it's safe to say I won't be needing it."}
{"text":"This place deserves better ratings than it gets. I have been coming here for years and very rarely do I get anything other than great service and great taste. They have been accommodating in the way that I asked that the pizza be cooked as I like the cheese browned.  Plus we love all of their pasta dishes, sandwiches and salads.  All around, a great neighborhood Italian joint."}
{"text":"Pizza and wings are great here - better than most other Rosati's I've been to. Problem is you can't order online and they NEVER answer the phone to call in an order. Losing tons of business which I'm assuming they don't want or need. If you have tremendous patience, then it's a good place. If you are hungry now, save yourself the frustration and go somewhere else..."}
{"text":"Love their double dough pizza. This location is the best. Great service great pizza. Really surprised at the bad reviews. My husband and I both agree this is the best Rosati's we have been to. We are both pretty picky about our pizza and we have never had a bad pie here."}
{"text":"Excellent service and very helpful staff. Ranch was a bit watery, but wings were great!"}
{"text":"You should be ashamed of yourselves for your performance tonight. Dinner was supposed to take an hour to get here. It took 2. Then dinner got here and the box it came in literally fell apart because you had left it on the counter so long before delivering to us. Then we open it and it's literally pasta with basically a can of sauce on it. No meat, no cheese. At that point it wasn't even worth the calories, so we threw it in the trash. Thank god for protein shakes or else I would be starving right now. This place is awful and whoever was in charge tonight should be canned and never work in the food service industry again."}
{"text":"Awesome Chicago Pizza! Great zesty sauce, REAL Sausage with Fennel!! REAL Cheese. Best Pizza in Arizona!!! This from a Chicago Native. Exactly like back home."}
{"text":"I'm a southside Irish / Italian from Chicago. I've worked for the Barracos family. The Durbin's family and even the Rosatis in chandler. Same owner of this location but for some reason this location always is too busy and has too big of an attitude. The phone girls are snotty and when u ask them a question their minds exploded.  

Tonight I attempted to order a stuffed pizza delivered.  I order it the same way at all rosaties because their recipe calls for the top sauce to be added when the pizza goes in the oven. At this point you are cooking that sauce under direct heat for 45 mins. To me the sauce tastes burnt.  I like them to add the top sauce about half way thru. So that there's some flavor left in the sauce.  Apparently this is too goddamn difficult for the phone girl to relay to the cook who then says they are too busy.  What the fuck. Too busy ???  To add sauce to a pizza. This isn't the first time this location has an attitude problem and shitty customer service.  Better fix it kids. You ain't the only Chicago place in town any more.  Can't stand being talk to like a piece of shit when i order a pizza."}
{"text":"I'm not surprised at the low rating some of the other reviewers have given Rosati's.  The first time we had it, we got the pan pizza (I love chicago style) and were rather disappointed. It tasted good, but was way too gooey and the texture was off...each slice of pizza just kind of fell apart.

After that, we decided to give them another shot, and tried their thin crust.  It was MUCH better, but we still had the problem that the toppings wouldn't stay on the pizza.  It turns out that they just put too much sauce on it...if you order it with light sauce, then the toppings stay on just fine.

While I don't like it as well as Grimaldi's, we order it regularly when in the mood for thin crust pizza (we're having it tonight, as a matter of fact).  I'm very comfortable recommending that folks try their thin crust pepperoni with light sauce...order it well-done for extra crispiness."}
{"text":"Pan pizza is the way to go.  Thin crust is like paper.  Double dough is ok.  Sauce is good and tastes best on past style ( for some odd reason).  

Wings are ok for takeout wings.  Definitely had better but these are a decent app. 

Garlic cheese bread is also good.

Service is inconsistent.  More often than not my pizza is not ready when promised.  Workers are friendly."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza in the valley.  I've been to Cibo, Gramaldi's, and Pizzeria Bianco and while I love Cibo, this place tops it.  I ordered take out - thin crust with sausage, onions and fresh black olives.  It was ready in 20 minutes as promised.  They only use fresh ingredients, nothing canned and trust me you can tell.  That makes this our new go to pizzeria."}
{"text":"We order from this location all the time and the last 2 times has been sub par. The pizza was overdone and chewy. I am not sure what's going on, but we are very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Good, but expensive. A 14\" pizza and large antipasto was $37 delivered plus tip. Pizza was sliced in a weird manner;  not the usual spoked wheel, but crosswise. WTF?

The white pie with sausage and NO tomatoes tasted great -- even if it was sliced by Jack the Ripper. Antipasto was large with ample Italian deli meats and cheeses. All in all, the food was great, but on the expensive side."}
{"text":"Eh, it was okay.  I went twice in a week because the first time was delivered and it was cold.  The flavor was nice but I wanted to give it another chance...the second time I ate for take out.  Ordered two large pizzas (cheese and a meats) and a family size Greek salad.  The salad was delicious and the pizza was pretty good...felt the crust was a little bland but overall it was good.  I would go back...I took off points for my 1.5 hour wait on my delivery and the temp of the pizza when it got there."}
{"text":"We live two minutes away I gave explicit directions and they still could not find. They took pizza back then brought it back.
Can u imagine how cold it was.
They said they were inundated with orders but never told us it would be an hour and 10 mins to deliver, oh yes did I say we were two mins away.
If it were feasible for me I would have gone and picked up but it wasn't,
After using them for years we were disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place. Ordered on Saturday during March Madness. Was estimated delivery of 1 hour. Arrived in 30 minutes. Fresh, hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"I ate Rosatis when I lived in Chicago. Great pizza and their bottled giardiniera is fantastic."}
{"text":"I grew up in Chicago and I loved Rosatis.  This location (I've tried three) is the only one that tastes as I remember--amazing.

You hear a lot about Chicago deep dish, but its the thin crist Rosatis pizza that me, my family and my friends ate.

This pizza is consistently good and always arrives hot and perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizzaria. I was a huge fan of Ray's Pizza but over the last few years I've noticed that their pizza sizes have shrank and it seems like they're using it cheap mozzarella cheese that has a powdery taste to it. 

Rosati's Pizza is delicious I live in the outskirts of Chicago and it definitely reminds me of a place I used love. I usually get the plain cheese pizza which is seasoned with oregano on the thin crust. I have tried different varieties of pizza they're all really wonderful. 

The delivery is usually faster than Pizza Hut and Domino's. I had a mix-up with my pizza and they sent a brand new one within 15 minutes and corrected the order which was something I didn't expect. I especially love their giant party size pizza which is great when you have guests over. 

The menu is highly extensive so there is a lot of stuff I still need to try but I can't resist their Pizza so it'll take me awhile to work my way through this menu."}
{"text":"4.4/5 Stars - Best of the smaller regional \"chain\" pizza places. Only place in AZ that does both thin crust and thick crust well. Also the only place that does take-out pasta well. Best things to order are the pepperoni classic thin crust, stuffed pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms, or the chicken parmesan pasta (with penne instead of fettuccini)"}
{"text":"I was in town for work and was so busy one night I decided to stay in at the hotel and order a pizza for dinner. This pizza rocked, it was darn near perfect. The crust was perfectly thin and crispy and the crust to sauce to topping to cheese ratios were perfect. They put a small plastic webbing under the pizza that was just enough to keep the crust off the cardboard and ensure the crust stayed crispy and perfect. I love that these guys want to provide the best dish possible, even for delivery. Definitely on my list of places to eat when I'm in town."}
{"text":"The place I tried was on union hills, absolutely terrible..pizza was over done, wings were bad and I felt like a fool spending $30.00 there for a terrible product."}
{"text":"We had two double dough pizza's. The dough was not thoroughly cooked. The cheese and toppings were very scarce, especially for the price. The wings were probably the worst part. The BBQ sauce hardly tastes like BBQ. The mild wings were flavorless even though there was a lot of sauce on them. And you could tell they just came out of the freezer after a long time in there. And for 1 small pizza, 1 medium, and 18 wings, it was 50 bucks. Way over priced. We could have ate a nice sushi meal for less or has another pizza place for less, and had much better food too. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We decided on takeout. I ordered fries and a veggie pizza. She ordered the homemade baked lasagna, a fountain soda, and plain cheesecake. 

What I loved: 

1) Taste of Food
2) Employees
3) Professionalism (attitude, helpfulness, etc.)


The delivery guy had a genuine personality and awesome attitude. I gave a wrong address and corrected it online. I received a timely text message and had everything taken care of. I even called the \"place\" to have the correction made. The person who answered the phone sounded like a wonderful guy and assisted me asap! 

I recommend this place to anyone who treasures good food, expects professionalism, and wants a pleasant delivery service."}
{"text":"One person working here on Sunday when we visited was super rushed, told me he had to make the slices of pizza if I wanted to order a slice....correct me if I'm wrong that's the point of going to a restaurant??? Right?? Okay fine we ordered a whole pizza, 6 wings, and he took payment. Then told us there's 5 orders ahead of you, so it's going to be awhile....uhhh maybe tell people that before swiping the card. Dude is overworked and not happy for you to be there. Maybe they need more people here to help...Food was good though!"}
{"text":"I just paid $6.99 for 8 stuffed mushrooms, even though the website said $3.99. Horrible!! Way over priced for crap food.. And the calzone was a joke. Way better pizza places for much more reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"I like the thin crust of the pizza. I've heard some people complain that it's like flatbread or that it has some char on the edges. I think that's just the style of pizza. Go to Giardano's if you don't like thin crust! . Their wings are excellent and their prices are reasonable. They may be a little spendy for what they are, but their delivery drivers are always courteous and I've never had a bad experience with them."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town.  Always consistent in quality and flavor.  Must be managed well; friendly staff and timely product for a very popular store. It always smells so good when you walk in and food taste just as wonderfyl. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place. Deep dish is my personal favorite, though the thin is also quite good. Been going for years and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Not happy usually pretty good but expensive. Today not good.  It was undercooked and kinda light on the sauce. $23 for a one topping 16 inch  undercooked and dry 
Not first time 
But the last"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza thick or thin. They know how to get it done. Wings are decent, but make sure to request well done on delivery. Oddly enough, they have barbecued ribs that are among the best around. 

They offer pick up or delivery at your choice. 

On the weak side, salads are very average. Go for the pizza and you won't be let down."}
{"text":"Fantastic tasting pizza and a little something for everyone. I highly recommend the deep dish. I typically have it delivered and have never had an issue with them- the only place in Surprise that can boast about this. The one time there was an order mistake they more than made up for it. Note-they are a little pricey and if you have fussy children, like I do, you may want to double check if it is crushed tomatoes as opposed to traditional sauce."}
{"text":"It's the best pizza in Arizona, imo... and I prefer this location to the one on Alma School (they taste the same) but I've gotten cold deliveries before there, and this is too expensive to be cold.  The Wisconsin cheese is excellent (only Tillamook compares) and I love the thin crust (for carb watchers).  Love, love, love"}
{"text":"Wow, never knew pizza could be so bad. Being from Illinois this is a shame and a disgrace to call this Chicago style deep dish. Just ordered it last night and the sauce was a joke and it was all on one side. Never again, stay away."}
{"text":"I've only had to throw out 3 pizzas in my life. The thin crust garlic and sausage we got here is #4. They seemed to have forgotten the garlic as well. Soggy, nasty and the massive amount of cornmeal on the bottom kept trying to chip my teeth. The pizza place right across the street is 1000X better and a hell of a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"When I moved to South Chandler, I was happy to find a Rosati's that delivered to my area. I enjoyed the location in Tempe and this location is everything I could ask for as well. I've had 3 deliveries of some combination of pizza/wings/subs in the past 3 months. The food is consistently great and the delivery service is on time or better. I saw the mixed reviews and was skeptical. My past experiences in Tempe convinced me to give it a shot and I'm glad I did. I can't speak to the dining in experience, but I've definitely been pleased with the food that was delivered to me."}
{"text":"Nope.  Wanted to like this place.  Was misquoted price for delivery on phone.  We were told $17 on the phone when the credit card was charged.  On delivery the receipt was for $28.  For a 16 inch pizza.  The customer service was not good from beginning to end.  Never a good sign.  The pizza reminded me nothing of Chicago pizza in taste.  It's like they added enormous amounts of fat and salt with no taste benefit.  I see this place getting a complete management/owner overhaul or go out of business sooner than later."}
{"text":"Horrible. This is the second time I tired this location. Called in an order on Saturday to pick up Sunday at 3pm. Got there about 10 minutes early. Sat there til 3:15 waiting. Pizza was sitting in the warmer getting cold and wings were not ready. And the manger could care less. All she  cared about were the delivery orders. Sad thing is I paid and gave them a tip before I realized my order was not ready. I will never use this location every again. I recommend no else does either."}
{"text":"More expensive, yep.  Possibly not as close by as a chain pizza...probably.  Worth the extra cabbage and drive?  Without a doubt!  The only true deep dish option in the Valley.  I'm old school and get peperoni and sausage pan style, but saw they added a \"double dough\" pie to the menu.  Not sure what that means, but applying logic, more Rosati's must be a good thing."}
{"text":"Wanted to eat at the restaurant, not carry out. Poor seating, no real table, no trash can to throw trash into when you are done. Owner must be oblivious to how to run a restaurant or how to build a repeat customer base...POORLY DONE!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this particular location for years,  I have never picked up a bad pizza ever!  Being from Chicago, this is by far the best pizza I have found in AZ!! I've been to a few other locations and they were okay, but the Warner and McClintock location is the best! The girls are always polite on the phone, and everyone is friendly when I walk in.  I would recommend this location if you want a great pie!!"}
{"text":"Went in for dine-in. Asked for a menu. He pointed to the one on his register. Let me gather my family of 5 around to look at it, genius. He finally fished one out for us. I placed the order. Still waiting. Literally high school kids running around unorganized. Still waiting. A lady that had called in and was quoted 45 minutes waited with me for 30. Still waiting. Customer service is abysmal. Still waiting."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!  Had an order delivered by Uber the order was wrong I called and the owner said that's not our problem talk to Uber.  He said we deliver you should've called us directly now it's your issue.  Not a good way to do business needless to say we will never get food from that place again"}
{"text":"This location has improved a lot of the years. All the other Rosati's around offer the buy a 18 inch and get a free 12 in cheese pizza without a coupon. This location won't honor that without a coupon. So that's kind of a bummer. We usually go to the other Chandler location because of this."}
{"text":"Place is really good. The deep dish is my favorite and I really the beef as well. Most of the people that gave negative reviews are only using Yelp to bash restaurants."}
{"text":"This is hands down some of the best pizza I have ever had! There pizza pie is awesome and hard to find especially in the southwest. There hot wings are also some of the best I have every had!"}
{"text":"I ordered one of Rosati's gourmet pizzas for takeout on a Friday night.  The pizza was pretty good, but had some pitfalls.  The service was okay, but not entirely reassuring when the employee didn't know the menu.

2.5 stars - I've had better, but it wasn't terrible.

As I placed my order I had a couple of questions....namely how much is a 16 inch gourmet pizza?  Instead of giving me this information, he asked me for my order.  Fine- I can always tell him no later.  I requested the 16 inch Pizza Valentino and was quoted $25- wow.  That is an expensive pizza.  I then asked \"it looks like there is a pepper compote or something on the pizza, is that correct?\" The response I got was \"Well, I don't know every pizza on the menu, and that's not really a popular pizza\".  Are you joking, you don't know your menu and couldn't just tell me \"Let me check for you\" ??

I ordered the pizza anyway and hoped for the best.  When I arrived my pizza was ready and the kid at the counter showed it to me to confirm that it was correct, which was nice.  No significant complaints about the service once I was there. 

The flavor of the pizza was good enough, there were lots of toppings, not too much cheese, and a nice amount of sauce..  The \"thin, crispy crust\" that was advertised was all lies though.  The outer edges of the crust were very crispy were burnt (a very dark brown the whole way through and crumbly) and the middle was so soggy I had to scrape it off the cardboard with a spatula.  The middle pieces did reheat nicely in a toaster oven though.  The toppings (Italian beef, sausage, tomatoes, onions) were pretty good, though I would skip the sausage next time, as it had zero flavor.  The beef was actually very good, lots of flavor and very thin and tender.

All in all, I would NOT pay $25 for this pizza.  There are frequent deals through Groupon Now and the store itself though, which makes the price a little better.  Still expensive for what you get, but better.  I won't say that a decent coupon won't tempt me to try Rosati's again, but my first impression wasn't great."}
{"text":"For dinner tonight my boyfriend and I decided to try out this new Italian restaurant. After placing our order we felt like deciding to eat here was a big mistake. We had to use the only menu that the restaurant had which was printed on a small flyer.After we ordered while we were waiting we saw a delivery guy running back inside to grab another half of an order that he forgot to deliver, the manager arguing with a older woman about how their coupons worked explaining that they expired a day earlier than printed, and we saw a man waiting for his order which he was told was ready for him when it was not. On top of all that we also noticed that the staff were swamped with phone calls involving  other problems customers were having. In addition, we noticed that the place was dirty seeing that tables were messy along with the floor being dusty and having bits of food on them.

Once we got home we started to un-box the food and we noticed that the order of french fries were cold and soggy. In addition our mozzarella sticks were also cold and solid rather than being stringy when being pulled apart.The pizza was likewise a disaster. The crust was bland, the sauce was mediocre, the mushrooms on our pizza were clearly canned and not fresh, and the cheese seemed to be congealed as well. A Little Caesar's Hot n Ready PIzza taste better than this. The only redeeming factor was that their pepperoni had a good flavor.  

If you are looking for good pizza in the area look up Venezia's or Geno's Pizza."}
{"text":"You think they would be able to get an order for one med. pizza and a side of wings, ($35, $40 w/ tip) right, but they can't (my order was missing additional items that I was charged for but did not receive.). And when you've already waited an hour for delivery, and are brutally disappointed, you call back to rectify the situation and all they offer you is $5 credit on your next order. Pathetic!!! There will be no next order!
P.S. I'm afraid to eat the chicken wings, for chance of food poisoning. They looked under cooked.
P.S.S. don't waist your money and time...."}
{"text":"Well, I just had dinner from this place and felt I had to write about it immediately. This is the second time I've had Rosati's. Last time I wasn't impressed at all. Previously I had their \"double dough\" pizza, which is \"twice as thick\" as the thin'n'crispy dough. Whatever. It wasn't great the first time. However the father-in-law has had some pizzas from the Anthem location and said he really liked it. Tonight we were looking for something quick to eat and I suggested one of the various pizza places around Surprise. Anyway, we decided to give it another chance. I went and got a take-out order of their pan-style \"classic combo\".

The second time round, they failed miserably. I love pan pizzas, not the cracker-crust crap. The box was pretty heavy which was a good thing. I brought it home and revealed the contents, with the wife watching eagerly (it was after 9pm). The first thing that registered was a little confusion. Granted, the pizza was very thick, but it looked like someone had just poured a can of freakin peeled tomatos over the top of the pizza and then half-heartedly dusted some parmesan cheese on it. What the? I've never seen anything like it. The tomato base and chunks were on the TOP of the cooked cheese and other ingredients! Well, whatever, I figured that was probably the Sicilian way or something. Next up, both of us had to get a teflon spatula to pick up the pieces since the whole top of the pizza was soggy. The dough was still firm underneath, so after wrestling with the ultra-stringy mozzarella we busted out the TV trays and commenced dining.

It tasted okay. We used knives and forks. I tend to do this rather than wind up with a hand that looks like I've just helped a cow give birth. But after the ten mins or so I spent carving my way through the morass of toppings, my third and final slice was soggy as hell - by that time the toppings had finally seeped down to the bottom of the dough. I couldn't get through it. By the time I was done, I'm not even kidding, my plate looked like what I had left in the bottom of a toilet in Portland last year when I was violently ill after having one of those churrascarria Brazilian meat shower meals. Just red muck, meat pieces and a combination of crisp and soggy pan dough. Please see the photo (camphone) I'll attach showing the pizza after we'd taken a few slices of it.

I'll never go back. A complete waste of money. However, it wasn't the WORST pizza I've ever had (that honour belongs to Pizza Pizzazz in Sydney), and they MIGHT have gotten two stars if they'd remembered that 1) their pizza ingredient list on the website DIDN'T include canned tomatoes and 2) tomato base is laid on the dough FIRST before the rest of the toppings. So yeah, crossing another one off my list. Definitely the \"Mozilla Firefox\" of pizza joints: second rate, badly-prepared and something to be avoided by all but the terminally clueless."}
{"text":"This is the second time in 3 months. Very disappointed with the order again! I like the Chopped Salad with veges, chicken, tortellini. Even when i ask for what is in the menu listed for this $9.95 salad, they fail! Im done! Rigatonis across the street has superior pizza and salad! Bye bye Rosatis! Poof!!!"}
{"text":"Now I've never been to Chicago and I've never had the deep dish, so I'm probably not the best person to be writing this review, but I'm still going to put in my thoughts! Not bad, but not good, either. What really ruined it for me was the cheese. It was just, rubbery. I don't think any kind of pizza should have rubbery cheese. That's a huge no-no for me. The crust was good, though. I liked the balance of softness and crispy."}
{"text":"This was my sons favorite place to get pizza growing up but I have not ordered from here for 5 years. I had too many bad experiences with wait times but pizza was always great. I ordered again.... and I waited 2 hours for the pizza they made it but forgot to deliver it. They did bring it after I called and it was free the pizza was great but not sure if I want to chance it again I waited 5 years last time after a bad experience maybe I'll try again in a few months."}
{"text":"Since we couldn't get the gas tank filled for supper on the grill, went to Yelp for a good pizza.  We actually used delivery as well and was told it would be 45 min to an hour and 30 minutes later we had the most awesome hot pizza at our door.!  Finally found a great amazing pizza in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Another great gem in Surprise! There toppings are a little heavy, that's right... Too much toppings? No such thing! It is amazing pizza and I like the fact you can get thin crust! It maybe more expensive but you're actually getting real quality ingredients! Don't go cheap, reward yourself!"}
{"text":"We tried their pizza. It was way too soggy. Tasted kinds odd. Maybe we are not familiar with type of pizza. But their pasta was awesome. And I normally shy away from pasta. Their chicken Alfredo with artichokes were great. We ordered for lunch and they delivered right on time."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised when I read the reviews of the haters here. We live nearby and have been getting pizzas for years and have loved every one. Just had my favorite - the Classic Combo. Are the haters other pizza joints?"}
{"text":"I like to stop in here and get the Italian beef sandwich. Every single time this thing is a monster!!! Always quick service too, Im in and out in 5 min!"}
{"text":"I hate giving a 3 star review. Their pizza is the best ever. I get the luau Hawaiian. It's simple delicious. Why 3 stars? I ordered mild chicken wings with blue cheese dip. I get home and the wings were hot and they forgot the blue cheese dip. When I pay $26 for a medium pizza and 8 wings, my order should be correct. I'll be back for the pizza, forget the wings."}
{"text":"Delicious crispy crust on the Chicago style pizza! Totally worth the price. The classic combo is chock full of meat and veggies. Delivery was fast and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We were on the phone with the manager and we explained that we wanted to order online but couldn't figure out how to. He started to walk us thru then just hung up on us. Sadly we've ordered there before but reconsidering now"}
{"text":"Great pizza, but lots of confusion at this location about the groupon now deals. Showed up to pick up my pizza and was told I could not use it. Be careful."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!!! They have their own unique herbs and spices they use on their thin (awesome) and we just tried their Chicago deep dish. Holy smokes it was SPECTACULAR!!!!! This is my \"Go to\" joint for pizza in Chandler."}
{"text":"Rosati's Pizza is my go to pizza joint. They are basically a carry out place. I live too far away for delivery. So that tells you how far I'll travel for an excellent tasting pizza.

They currently have this special where you buy a large and get the medium (excludes the toppings) 1/2 off. I hope I haven't let the secret out on that special. It's been going on for well over a year. I always bump into a lot of Chicago people when in here. I always get a bigger pizza than I can eat since it's the perfect breakfast food. After all, who can resist some reheated pizza the next morning for breakfast!

I really like the thin crust but my family prefers the deep dish. So I'm stuck eating deep dish all the time, lol. This is the best tasting pizza I have had in Arizona. The Cenpho folks might want to venture out of their box and try this pie. This is something even the east coasters would enjoy. 

Once in awhile they'll even mess up your order but they are quick to rectify it if you give them a chance. And once in awhile they'll even burn your pizza a little. Even with these rare annoyances I keep coming back to this Rosati's location every time."}
{"text":"On 11-08-2017 we had this location deliver food for my rehearsal dinner.  From the day we went in with ordering questions, to the day we placed the order, to delivery, the entire staff was great! The driver was prompt, extremely helpful with bringing in the food (enough for 50 people) and he brought us the most delicious dinner. We had beef for loose meat sandwiches (including the bread and peppers) which was tender and juicy, 50 pcs of fried chicken, garlic bread, 2 full trays of mostaccoli with meat sauce, 2 full trays of salad with assorted dressing and enough napkins and utensils to last us through the weekend. Everyone was extremely satisfied with the amazing quality and taste of the food. We will definitely be using Rosati's again and again! Thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"Best chain style pizza in town. We alternate between here, Spinato's, and Streets, but Rosatis double thick is my fav. Be warned though, it's pretty expensive so it wouldn't be my choice when all the guys are over for football. But it's perfect for family pizza night.

This location is delivery and take out only."}
{"text":"There isn't a single piece of bad pizza here, and I would put this location up against the best pizza shops in Arizona!  They fall short on their consistency to have stunning customer service, but if that means I have to deal with a little bit to get this pizza... totally worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Still searching for that best pizza in the valley! Since our favorite was at Bronco Billies, and they recently closed down! Since Rosati's was across the street, we had to give them a try! We ordered a thin crust, pepperoni, green peppers, cooked well done. I was surprise with the burst of flavor. I do wish they would have cooked the pizza even longer! Crust were not crispy enough. We also tried their garlic bread, and jalapeno popper! Again, they should have been cooked just a little bit longer. Over all we were very happy with their food! We will come back again!!"}
{"text":"Although my husband loves this place, I don't share the sentiment. 

The pizza is OK at best. I will say they offer FAST delivery (although we only live about a mile away) and the pizza is always pipping HOT when it arrives. It's just nothing to write home about. And in all honesty, I am more into gourmet pizzas with \"crazy\" toppings like articoke hearts, pine nuts, goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes and such. Surely it is just my lack of appreciation for \"normal\" pizza that prevents me from thinking this place (and more importantly its pizza) is something special."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken parm, 2 spaghettis, chicken alfredo and 3 sausages at 6 pm. Finally got delivered at 7pm. Opened it up and no chicken alfredo or sausages. Called the store to ask about my order. They were very apologetic and said \"we will get it to you soon\" I asked for a timeframe and they said \"all the drivers are out it could be a while\" I asked to speak to a manager, put on hold and someone answers \"hello\" she sounded no older than 16. I asked if she was the manager and she said there is no manager there but she could help me. I proceeded to ask her since I've been waiting for an hour for my food, why was I not made a top priority to get my food delivered. Once again i asked for a manager and she said \"Stan will not be there till Thursday\" 

Really Rosatis of Surprise? No manager on duty? It's 730 pm now and I still haven't received the rest of my order. 

Update 741pm. 1 hour and 41 minutes after I ordered the remaining order was delivered. I will NEVER order from Rosatis again."}
{"text":"I found them on Google and looked at the menu before ordering so that I can get a price on a thin crust pepperoni pizza the price was $16.49 at least that's what the site said .I called and placed my order and the young man was nice but the price was $10.00 more then what was advertised. The young man proceeded to tell me that the site was wrong because it was Google and that there's more than one franchise of the same name and for me to check the website so I place my order and hung up .Then I research the website and yes it was their website, their phone number and their menu .so i called back and asked to speak to the manager which also was friendly but,continued to tell me that the website is wrong and that their price is $26.49 and there's nothing he can do about it . Wow is this not America where  you have to honor the advertisement ?"}
{"text":"Wow, a lot changes in 5 months. I gave 5 stars back then but with this new ownership, not this time.

Order my usual and was told it would be 20 to 25 minutes. So I headed over at 30 minutes and was told by (Darrin I think) said that my order just came out and he'll go get it. So I waited 10 more minutes while he and a driver were chit chatting in the kitchen to get me slice and cheese sticks. When he finally handed my order to me, he offered no apology.

Once I got back to my office the order was not correct and the slice was cold. I gave them a call and Darrin tells me he's the manager, so I told him the problem. Again no apology, he just starts whining about being the only person back there with 4 orders. I explained to him getting a slice out to a waiting customer makes sense since they cool off faster than a full sized pizza. This clown goes on to tell me how difficult it is to work back there by himself and I must never have worked in the food industry before.... well, jackass, yes I have, for many years and I learned two things- how to prioritize and how to offer great customer service. 

So in trying to find a real manager to speak with I called the Val Vista store, the young ladies there had no idea what to do so they told me to call Nicole back at 5. 

To the owners of these franchise locations- you need to do some in depth training of your staff on a variety of issues."}
{"text":"We had the meat classic, deep dish.  It was wonderful.  So thick, and the crust was very good.  They did a great job with the toppings as well.  It was a bonus they delivered to the hotel we were staying at.  The downfall that kept it from getting 5 stars was the price.  It was $32 for a extra large pizza, and another $2.50 for delivery.  I was a big fan of the pizza, but at that price, it would not be my first choice, except once in a while."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and service from everyone there. Is definitely go back and I will only order pizza from here from now on. Best pizza in surprise az !! Thanks for everything!!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience.   First..the place is filthy.   The bathrooms are vial, the is a nice layer of greasy oil on the floor,  and the tables are sticky.   My pizza was very under cooked,  so the cheese was not melted and the crust was chewy and yeasty tasting.   I did get an \" I'm sorry \" when I told them.  Save your money."}
{"text":"Can't say it was bad. Its chicgo style so they cut pizza in small appitizer squares. And the regular is super thin like paper thin. The large pizza seemed small enough for 2 people at most. But that's okay the problem was after an hour it arrived cold. Sorry I don't like cold pizza. Next time ill have to try it at their shop. Hope they read this and find way to correct cold pizza issue. Its a ton better cold than dominos."}
{"text":"Great service and tasty Italian beef! We get the beef for parties. Warm it in the Au Jus in a crock pot. Yum."}
{"text":"Rosati's is right around the corner so we have ordered quite a few times.  80% of the time you get a great pizza.  We usually get the thin crust, the double dough is good but just a lot of bread. Their Italian beef sami's are great, lots of meat and cheese.   Every so often you get a blah pizza.  The  crust is really dry and its just kinda eh. If you are looking for cheap pizza this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"Not welcoming! Manager was rude , rushed & impatient. Will never drive 30 mins to be treated like this again. We left upset , without ordering..."}
{"text":"My husband has been ordering the \"Meat Mania\" pizza from Rosatis for the past year as Rosatis  is close to our home, not because of the quality of Rosatis pizza.  I've choked down a slice to keep my husband company, but have always considered the pizza to be garbage.  Tonight I think the pizza and the service was so bad that we're not ever ordering from Rosatis again.  Unbelievably, over the course of the year, we had accumulated 12 box coupons that supposedly would allow us to order a Rosatis pizza at a  50% discount. Tonight we thought we'd take advantage of what became apparent was a phoney offer.  The woman who took our telephone order tonight pretended to be unfamiliar with the offer, and was extremely rude. I will note that our order not only included the meat mania pizza, but three extra toppings, and six wings.  We were only able to persuade her that the 50% discount was for real by having her look at the coupon on a box she could look at at the restaurant. Instead of giving us the \"Meat Mania\" with three extra toppings at half price, she ripped us off by giving us only a pizza with the three extra toppings we ordered ( mushrooms, olives, and garlic) with no meat at all.  My husband called Rosatis upon getting the pizza home, and asked to speak to the manager.  A man identified as \"Tim\" claimed to be the manager, and mumbled a half-hearted apology for the error.  My husband didn't demand a refund as the woman who took the order was pregnant, and he felt sorry for her. I must say that I feel sorry for the kid that the ignoramous woman who cannot even do a simple job of taking a pizza order is producing. America is in serious trouble if this is the best we can do."}
{"text":"Pizza was great. Love the deep dish. Anti-pasta was disappointing as was the spaghetti with meatballs (only 2 small meatballs for $13). The worth part was the wait, when we place the order for delivery we where told that it will take about an hour but it took over an hour and a half on a Sunday afternoon. They are only 10 minutes away. If I try it again it will be pick up."}
{"text":"Well, looking to expand our take out pizza choices. We tried ROSATIS. Spent $107.00. We loved the wings-ordered them naked to add the sauce at home. The deep dish was a hit. The thin crust was really thin and ho hum. So up to here we would use Rosatis again. Now this was the deal breaker. We ordered a cesar salad. We even asked specifically if they made their dressing in house. The fact that we got a garden salad isn't so bad. It's the reaction I got when I called back. I spoke to Rocky, the person  who took our order. He was pretty clear it was a communication issue and it was our mistake. That never feels good especially after dropping $100 for take out. He did offer for us to bring the salad back and swap it --yeah, right- but continued to let me know about the communication mistake I had.  Never offered to spot us a salad for next time and was 'sorry about that' several times. The whole experience was unsatisfying. I continue to be surprised and disappointed Ricky handled my call in such an indifferent manner. If that's how you are treated with a $100 order, can't imagine the customer service would improve for a $30-40 take out order. For us, never again. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Ok, for starters I am usually the last one to complain but I feel compelled to save everyone from the save experience we had. We bought a groupon for Rosatis, it has some of the most delicious pizza on earth. We couldn't wait to take our parents who were visiting from out of town there! We do have 5 daughters as well, I am used to being very patient always having a big group. From the second we walked it was a terrible experience. I was greeted by the cashier who rolled her eyes at me when I told her we were dining it. It was 9:15 and they did close at 10. We proceeded to order about $80 worth of food. We sat and waited and waited and waited. Approx 35 minutes later I asked if we could please get the salads we ordered and maybe the wings as we waited for the pizza. The pizza does take a bit as it is Chicago style. About 10 minutes later they did bring out the salads but NO silver wear. Standing at the cash register waiting for 10 minutes for silver wear and seeing a very strange cash transaction between 2 employees one guaranteeing the other to pay the register back by morning, my step-dad jumped in and asked for silver wear, which we finally did receive.  Now it's a little past 10 and 9 very hungry people are finally being able to eat. When the grand finale FINALLY arrived a LARGE FULLY LOADED CHICAGO pizza it had sauce poring every over the table, the crust which is VERY thick was soggy and make matters worse it was barely warm. We were SO disappointed and looked forward to sharing this with our parents. My husband loves to add things like he wants bludgeon himself with a dull knife in the femur and this time I TOTALLY would agree with him. Rosatis is a great place with wonderful food this location was just terrible."}
{"text":"Called to get a pizza delivered, the guy said they wouldn't deliver. Just pick up. I've gotten pizza delivered from there before. Very rude."}
{"text":"ROSATIS ON GILBERT ROAD, IN CHANDLER, IS TERRIBLE!!! Ordered food online at 530pm- was told it would be 1.5 hours for delivery. Called store to ask if it would be quicker to pick up- was told by MGR that it would actually only be 40-45 mins for delivery. Two hours later, I have NO FOOD, and when I told MGR I wanted to cancel order and be refunded, he said he could only give me a $15 credit for next order. UMMMMMM..... No thank you!! So, still no food, and just spent over 15 minutes on phone with Grubhub (order and delivery service) for them to tell me that they will refund my $53 dollars- but not for up to 5 days!!!! Unbelievable! Very disappointed, because we really liked ordering from there, but will not again. I strongly recommend not eating/ordering there unless you have a REALLY long time to wait!!"}
{"text":"I ordered through the website it estimated 60 to 70 minutes I got my food in like 35 minutes it was excellent will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Rosati's is always a go-to delivery pizza for me! Ten years ago I moved to Scottsdale from Chicago and was very sad at the lack of good pizza around, so I was so excited to discover Rosati's years ago. 
In the years that I have been a Rosati's customer and the tons of times I've ordered here, I have only been disappointed a few times. These times the pizza tasted and looked different than usual, like too much seasoning and undercooked. However, the majority of the time, I am pleased and my inner Chicago girl is satisfied. 
One other small thing I don't like is the breadsticks. They always come a tad soggy, flavorless, and too hard. Just recently started getting their garlic bread though, and it is much better. 
I have never had a deep dish pizza here, but it looks really good from the pictures. I will continue to order Rosati's as long as I live in the area, awesome pizza!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza. I don't care much for thin crust, but the hand tossed and the Chicago style deep dish was off the hook. Sometimes my work orders pizza, and it never measures up to how good Rosati's is. 
It's pricy compared to what I'd like to pay, but it ends up being worth the cost every time. Staff is also friendly and efficient. 
They've made a regular out of me."}
{"text":"The real deal Chicago thin crust pizza. This has the original Chicago recipe. It's as good as any back there.
It's carryout and delivery only. It's the only location to go to."}
{"text":"It was very difficult placing my order as the person on the other end of the phone did not speak very good English.  However, with two different toppings on each side of the pizza, they got the order correct.  The pizza was delivered sooner than expected and was very good.  I would recommend Rosatis for a good pizza pie."}
{"text":"2nd delivery  - the food was still good but no where near as tasty as the last time we ordered and got the exact same thing. The Alfredo didn't taste the same- almost like the  \"delicious\" got skipped and the pizza sauce wasn't as flavorful. They lost a star with this order.



Delivery - Amazing pizza, legit chicken Alfredo....the sauce is insanely good and authentic spices. The chicken wings taste slow roasted. Really good food!!"}
{"text":"I really love this place!I'm so glad our family found it because my husband is a pizza contiseur and he gives it the golden seal of approval.I'm not a huge pizza fan but for this place I make an exception.We have ordered their version of a stuffed crust and their large hand tossed pizza's,thier spaghetti and salads.All of them were excellent with very punctual delivery,their staff is always so polite when I call in the order.The one time I had to go in and deal with them personally was a nice experience and the employees helped bring my stuff out to the car which most places aren't so thoughtful.This is my favorite new pizza place with great recipes and fresh ingredients which makes my husband very happy since we eat pizza more than we did!"}
{"text":"Expensive Pizza !!! Check website for coupons
Fast service online ordering and friendly staff. The last time I ordered the Driver forgot part of my order. I said don't worry about it and he asked about 15 times are you sure. 20 min later he rang the doorbell with a free 2ltr and the missing item."}
{"text":"This was the second time eating at this location and it was absolutely awful. The first time we ordered a deep dish pizza and the stupid delivery boy must have set it funny in his car because all of the cheese and sauce were crammed to one side of the box and there wasn't a scrap left on the actual pizza...gross.  My office used to order from the one on Power for lunch at least once a month and they had the BEST chicken parm I have ever had! This location however, it was not even edible. Instead of an actual chicken breast it was about 5-6 slices of chicken about the size of my finger that were all dried out and mostly burned, also the spaghetti that was in some nasty, watery, marinara soup was burned on the top. How is it possible to burn spaghetti?! Went right I the trash."}
{"text":"This location has nose dived, huge letdown for my family as we used to order from here at least weekly.  My wife called in an order (same order we always place) and when she arrived to pick up it was wrong.  No big deal mistakes happen but she waited 45mins for the replacement pizza as the counter help kept adding time w/o explanation.  She was finally so frustrated she came home and i went back for our order.  Still not ready!  Finally got it home and it was wrong again!  Forget it, we are switching to Germann and Alma sch"}
{"text":"Rosati's is legit pizza. As a Chicagoan, it is hard to find decent thin crust AND deep dish in the same place. Rosati's has it. There isn't really anything I would change, except that I live and work at a weird cross section of three of their territories. So every time I go to order delivery, who will and will not deliver to me changes. Just depends on who I get when I call - which is annoying. The pizza, though, is fantastic."}
{"text":"I used to like Rosati's Pizza, but tonight I ordered a pizza for delivery at my hotel, and they told me it would be WITHIN the hour.  1 hour and 40 minutes later the pizza arrived....cold.  What a waste of money!  The delivery man said he would have them take 10% off.....ooooh, really?  The pizza should have been free!  Sorry to say....this will be my last Rosati's pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout and they said 35-45 minutes.  When went to pick up, we had to sit and wait an extra 15 minutes.  Another waiting customer said he had been waiting over 2 hours for his order.  During our wait, we noticed that the person managing the cash registers disappeared.  Then we saw her walk back in, through the back door, with a pack of cigarettes in her hand.  I can understand the need for a smoke break, but probably not the best time to do it when there are 7 waiting customers in your restaurant.  This isn't out first encounter with slow service here, but we thought the last time was a fluke.  Never again."}
{"text":"Got home late from work and didn't feel like cooking, we've just moved into a new house and had a friend over helping put the final touches on unboxing the place.  We ordered our favorite!  Rosati's.  I was disappointed that this location didn't seem to offer all the same items as other Rosati's and the online menu on their web site would not come up even as I was on the phone with them trying to order for delivery.  They were nice but not as helpful as I thought they would be.  I ordered two pizzas and the family size fettuccine Alfredo .. The pasta was dry and the sauce was not creamy at all, the chicken was bland and it just missed the mark.  We had the cheese and the pepperoni pizza on thin crust.  As always I love the flavor of their sauce and they use high quality cheese but unlike other Rosati's that I've tried, the crust was limp.  Even though it's thin crust, the other locations I've received delivery from still sent us out a crispy, light .. almost cracker crust that isn't burned.  Still love Rosati's but last nights deliver missed the mark."}
{"text":"This is for the west Mesa & Tempe location, as they were both pretty much the same.

Probably the best pizzas I have ever had. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is simply the price. It is twice as expensive as pizza hut or papa johns, although it is more than twice as delicious. It's definitely worth it if you use some coupons.

I've had the monster thin and just now, the classic combo stuffed pizza. WOW! The 16\" classic combo stuffed pie is HEAVY! No skimping on toppings or cheese. Worth paying $27. A $27 thin crust, ehh, once in a while.

If you've got the dough to spend, it's the best.

And I though the service was just fine."}

{"text":"This review is for the Rosatis on Dynamite and Alma School in North Scottsdale....

Lets see, ....two restless kids ages 6 and 8......6:30PM and no arrangements made for dinner.  So what do we do?  How about pizza and a movie back at the hotel........but where to get good pizza...hmmmmmm.  Well Rosatis is the place!  And the good news is that they even deliver.  The pizza is some of the best we have had.  Beautiful thin crust and delicious toppings.  We went with a 18\" Classic Combo and it was  just the ticket!   The only downside was the delivery time.  They said it would take 45 to 'no more than an hour.  They finally showed (after a second call) an hour and 10 minutes into it.  Kids were almost fried by then, but I would go back at them with a second chance!"}
{"text":"First time order here. I chose delivery. Great service. Pizza was still piping hot. And delicious. Perfect amount of sauce. Nice crisp thin crust. Generous amount of pepperoni and cheese. And best thing? Very little grease. I'd give 5 stars but they are very pricey for pizza. That will keep me from going back as often I I would like."}
{"text":"We love Rosati's pizza, but the management here is not the same as the other locations.  We went here because I had a groupon.  Long waits, unapologetic and condescending manager.   Amazing that he could have easily made things right, but chose to be a jerk and act unprofessionally.  I have always had excellent experiences at the other locations.  Will take my business elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service, down to the pizza performance. Spinatos and Oreganos is WAYYYY BETTER."}
{"text":"Rosati's is a funny franchise, like most small franchises are;   order at one location, and you won't get the same experience as another location.    The Rosati's in Tempe seems to know what they're doing.   If you want a good pizza, try this place.  

I order this at work a lot, and they make an excellent pie.   Cooked perfectly and pretty damn delicious.   A step above your average pizza joint!  I suggest the Pepperoni, Jalapeno and Bacon.    

Excellent!"}
{"text":"Holy slices of heaven on earth!!!!  This pizza is incredible.  

After a long day at work my boyfriend and I decided to order in. I turned to Yelp, found Rosati's, and 45 minutes later we had a glorious pizza delivered to my door.  

We had the double-dough pizza with cheese and pepperoni. They hand-roll (braid?) the crust under itself, creating the ideal crunch and chew factor. 

There is something special about the cheese...or maybe it's the herb blend on top...or both. Whatever it is, I found myself eating a third (and fourth) slice. 

When you want to do pizza, don't waste your time or money on other chains--Rosati's is the place to go!!!"}
{"text":"They are changing this location for the better for sure , staff is very friendly , nice , and food is AMAZING , first time I tried the pizza today as the sandwiches are so good , but pizza is sooooo good , we order from here all the time , don't belive the bad reviews"}
{"text":"Great pizza and great customer service . Last night I had a terrible experience with another local place - it took over 2 hours to get a cold pizza. So I decided to throw that pizza in the garbage and order Rosati's. They showed up before their quoted time, brought a hot pizza and were very polite on the phone. Definitely refreshing !"}
{"text":"Let me tell you a bit about Rosatis Pizza. Ordered a margarita pizza with extra sauce. The delivery took about an hour from the time I ordered. When finally receiving the pizza, I come to find out there was no pizza sauce on it at all! I called them and tried to figure out what happened. The employees were very professional, respectful and polite about issue and offered to bring by another pizza in exchange for the previous one that was brought! Needless to say I was extremely satisfied with the quality of food and professionalism of this establishment with just talking on the phone! Thank you Rosatis!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing, called a order in at noon for pick up at 3:45. And They \"forgot\" our order. Wasn't even busy. So we had to wait, way to long for them to make them"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time the other night at the Warner location. I believe this is a pick-up only location. Faith at the front desk is awesome. They are known for their deep dish I think...but I opted in for the rare thin crust.

It was good. I liked it alot, and I'd honestly compare the thin crust to oreganos thin crust (because of their size, cut, and pricing). I hope thats not a huge step down for some, because both are awesome. It was about a 25 minute wait on a friday night. I think I would have given this place a 5 star, if it had just a TAD bit little less grease. That was the only step back for me, honestly. But again, its alot of cheese, and toppings on a thin crust. So that is typical I think! I do find myself trying this again in the future."}
{"text":"I'm a pizza lover from Chicago. Had the thin crust here and it's pretty good. Again I'm from Chicago  use to great pizza. All in all the best I've found so far.
Don't know about there pan or deep dish..

I couldve just as easily made a pasta and garlic bread way more worth while!  Not going to be lazy about it again smh"}
{"text":"I ordered pizza from Rosati pizza in Surprise several  times. Has always been good pizza. This time I decided to order a Chicago deep dish pizza with sausage mushrooms onions and garlic. This pizza is not the standard of quality I'm used too from this Rosati. The topping coverage on this pizza was extremely light except for the garlic which was extremely heavy. On this 12\" pizza I had 4 slices with no sausage at all and very little mushroom. Other reviews are correct in my opinion the the quality of service at this Rosati has gone down hill. I will not be ordering from this Rosati again. There are plenty of Chicago style pizza places on west side."}
{"text":"Not good. 11.00 affords you a tiny, 6 inch sub that isn't worth the effort. Subway tastes better and has better quality ingredients. If you want an Italian sub look elsewhere. Very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"When I am feeling no shame I love to order their largest pizza. Why you ask? The large is a beast and you can add all manner of topping. I honestly order anchovies on half so that my wife will leave my half alone. Yes. I loathsome tactic but all is fair in love and war."}
{"text":"This place can suck a giant turd. Every Wednesday I call to place an order for a specific pick up time. Every Wednesday they mess it up. No more Rosatis, no more. I'll be looking for a new Wednesday night pizza pick up. Up next is Jets. Hope they don't cause me to go back to my anger mgmt classes."}
{"text":"Was craving pasta so decided to try Rosatis since they had delivery. I ordered on line and the food was at my door in 45min. The breaded cauliflower was yummy (Only bummed they forgot to send the ranch). The lasagna was also very good! We also got the penne Alfredo with chicken. It was OK. The chicken in it was kinda rubbery. All in all, it was a good experience. I would definitely order from here again in the future."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST pizza I have EVER eaten. Kid you not!! Ordered 4 large for work: Meat Classic, Margherita, pepperoni & veggie deluxe: FANFREAKINTASTIC!! We did thin crust on all. They were hot when they arrived & delicious. The crust was perfect. Place your order TODAY and support this place!! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"For some reason my fiancé thought he really liked this place from prior experiences but I had never really been too impressed. It had probably been a year and a half since we had ordered Rosati's so I figured we could give it a shot, I thought to myself that it must be better than Pizza Hut right? Wrong.

We ordered the pepperoni classic (pepperoni, mushroom, green pepper and onion) and an order of garlic breadsticks. Like the other reviews, we were told it would be about an hour for delivery. That was fine, not really a big deal for a good pizza. An hour and a half rolls around and we were both getting annoyed. Eventually I see a truck circling our street and I saw him pull out and back in three different times. I let my fiancé know and I told him that I thought it was probably the pizza guy having trouble with directions. He went outside and the pizza guy didn't even come to our door he just met my fiancé at the sidewalk and gave him our pizza. Weirdest pizza delivery ever. No door knock, no introduction, nothing. Weird.

Any how, after that weird pizza delivery situation we were starving. Worried that the pizza was going to be cold and soggy after an hour and half. It was. It wasn't only that it was soggy it was also that the sauce had a very strange flavor to it. I can't really put my finger on it but I guess it was probably most comparable to watered down soap. Yuck. I had a small piece and I was done. The garlic breadsticks were the only redeeming factor of the whole order and they were quite delicious which is why I ultimately gave two stars. The marina sauce that came with the breadsticks however, was also disgusting. 

Overall I will not order from Rosati's again. I will drive down to Spinato's instead and enjoy a delicious, freshly cooked and amazing pizza."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised how many low ratings this location has received. We order from here almost weekly and have never had one issue. Brandon is the definition of amazing customer service! He's cheerful when he answers the phone, is always giving suggestions and helping out with my large orders. The food is consistent...perfect, hot and delicious! This is our pizza place and I recommend it to everyone I talk to! Definitely give it a chance!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible.  I have ordered from them several times because I live in an area where few people deliver.  They have consistently been very late in delivering, sometimes up to an hour later than they said.  The food has been inconsistent, but tonight was a new low. I ordered Onion Rings that were literally refrigerator cold, I don't think they had been cooked.  I ordered boneless buffalo strips that came with no sauce.  I paid extra for Ranch that was not delivered.  I threw the food away.  I will never again under any circumstances order from this place again,  I will drive no matter how far rather than have them deliver.  There are not words to describe how bad they are."}
{"text":"Although the pizza is a bit expensive, I love this pizza! The deep dish is my favorite, but I also enjoy the thin crust as well. I ordered it for the family and worried that my father and 15 year old niece wouldn't like it as much as I do. They both thought it was \"pretty good\" so everyone was happy. I just wish they had a place to sit to order lunch. All in all, I will always come back here to enjoy a good pizza."}
{"text":"We have been ordering Pizza here for over 20 years & it is the best!  Prices are climbing a bit too high -- try to use coupons whenever we can. Take out & Delivery only."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE!!!

I had eaten here before at a different location and I really liked the food. My boyfriend didn't want to order from here because of the bad google reviews. He trusted me, and ordered anyway. 

We ordered for delivery at 7.15. At 8:30 they call and say the came to our house and left because we didn't answer. They said they would not return because it was our fault. When we pressed them, they gave us the address it was sent to, and it was the wrong house. We ordered online and could see it was a type-o on their end. They agreed to resend the pizza. 30 minutes later we STILL did not have it. They didn't want to refund our money because they said he had just left to drop it off. Finally (2 hours after we had ordered) they told us to call grubhub to get a refund. 

On this plus side of things Grubhub was super friendly and offered us a free meal. We wont be using it at this place.

Lesson learned. Trust reviews."}
{"text":"We've only gotten delivery from Rosati's,  and while its a pricey pie, it's always been yummy! We have had multiple orders and every time they delivered hot pizzas on time."}
{"text":"Love this place!   It's takeout only, but the whole family loves the pizza; we definitely don't have leftovers when we order Rosatis.   Make sure to ask for the free medium cheese pizza with the purchase of any large (or larger.)"}
{"text":"I took my kids for lunch here because we wanted some fried chicken...I heard their fried chicken was good, and it is a large portion.  We went inside, and there was only one other patron there, but it looked like she was one of the employees eating pizza.  We didn't get pizza, but her pizza looked great.  We ordered the fried chicken meal and it comes with 4 pieces of chicken and a large basket of fries, which I split with one of my kiddos.  My other kid got the chicken tenders.  We sat down and waited for our food, and it was brought out in a timely manner, and the staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  The fried chicken was great - nice and crispy...very good for a pizza joint.  The chicken tenders lacked flavor or seasoning so they were pretty bland.  They also had a movie playing on the flat screen while we were there - it was Lord of the Rings, which we love.  After eating, I looked around at the place, and there were some very dusty areas, one of which was dust on the open sign hanging from some chains.  The chains were so dusty and made me wonder if that isn't clean, then what else isn't clean?  They had another sign that hung from chains a few feet away from us and it was just as dusty as well as the black electrical cord...it had some hairy dust on it too.  The other place I noticed dust on was the air duct and air vent...since the ceiling is open, you can see these items clearly, and they had dust on them.  There were also hanging lights, but those didn't seem to have dust on them.  Seems like they just need a ladder and a slightly detailed eye...but management needs to enlighten their staff about these details....it was very obvious.  Things like this make the customer wonder what else isn't clean in the back where the food is being prepared.  I hope they get it together."}
{"text":"Best Pizza and the manager Jessie, his team and especially Lolo the cook are second to none! Their flat bread pizza is our favorite."}
{"text":"Do NOT LISTEN to the bad reviews on here. This pizza is an odyssey of alluring flavors!!! All the ingredients were fresh, the sauce is fantastic. The pepperoni was perfect, the sausage and beef were delicious. It has just the right amount of cheese. The smell was inviting!! Baked to perfection. A little spendy but well worth the extra dough (pun intended). Listen, I have had the best pizza imaginable and this is in the top 5 for sure. Why waste time, money elsewhere? That just doesn't make sense when you can go straight to the top with this one. After all, you only get so many meals in this lifetime, why bother going to the bottom dwellers huh? If you try Rosati's, get the \"Works\" Chicago Deep Dish style. I guaranty you will not be sorry!! :)"}
{"text":"This place... So we have ordered at least 4 times and inevitably they have been able to mess things up every single time. From delivering pizzas with all the toppings in the corner of the box to being cold to mozzarella sticks with no cheese in them. This time delivery was supposed to be an hour and finally got our cold pizza an hour and a half later. Save yourself the trouble, order from any place else!"}
{"text":"Yummm! The thin crust margarita is my top pick from Rosatis. The veggie supreme is a close second, but I prefer to keep the toppings to a minimum on thin crust pizzas. It's a little pricey, but it's a good treat from time to time. The staff is awesome & really seem to work as a team. I also like the transparency of being able to peer into the kitchen when you pick up your order."}
{"text":"I recently have been having issues at this location. They hired a young lady that gets everything from delivery or pick up wrong to repeating orders wrong. Today we received a pizza that in all our years ordering from here we have never changed our order. Today my order showed up completely wrong. When I phone them the same young girl answered the phone and argued with me. I asked to speak to the manager and she told me he was busy. I suggested she get him on the phone or I will drive over and speak to him in front of customers. He got on the phone. He was totally cool but wouldn't be able to send a replacement for up to 2 hours. Bs. Anyway if you order from here be sure to repeat your order back 2-3 times especially if the young girl takes your order"}
{"text":"First store blocks from my house in 4050 McQueen, Chandler does not take my Chandler Store Groupon.  They told me to the other Chandler store in a pushy nasty way  I went through the same hassle with the Alma School Store they saying theyalso  do not take Groupons.  They said try the store 8 miles from my house that I figured was in Gilbert.  Nightmare,  cold pizza that was not very good and an $8 salad that came in a bowl smaller than a cereal bowl.  The dressing and baggie of croutons comes in lil sealed containers like you get at Mcdonalds.   This for $33 and an hour + 40 minutes delivery time.   Looks like big corporate replacing the Rosati Family."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the horrendous ratings. This place isn't bad. Maybe better than average, but not bad. The pizza is actually good, and the service friendly.  My only gripe is the long wait times.  And that's for pick up, I can't imagine how long they would take for delivery. On our last 2 visits,  we waited an hour for our food to be ready. It was tasty, and cooked as we requested."}
{"text":"The downside to this pizza place outweigh the upsides. Average pizza, slim on toppings, small in size and over $23.00 for a large, which is on the medium size. Cashier and counter help, are dim and of the opinion, they really should be doing something more than waiting on middle age housewives calling in pizza orders. I hope something better comes along as well, but in the meantime your attitude is definitely cutting into your tip jar. The upside, it is strictly take out, they are quick - again the take out helps and the toppings are fresh and quality. Location is another plus, as in they are the closest pizza joint to my house."}
{"text":"It was okay. Not the best. The cheese has a weird consistency. After it was out for 20 minutes I went for a piece and it was just a rock hard slab. I even tried reheating it and it didn't do it any justice. Might come back and try the Chicago style though."}
{"text":"I love Rosati's Pizza, but the Rosati's in Surprise is not on my list of happy places anymore. 

We usually order delivery, thin crust, which comes brimming with tasty toppings: sausage, mushrooms, onions, more cheese than a dairy farm in Wisconsin, and a richly balanced sauce. Yummy enough. 

But two recent attempts at carry out left a bad taste in my mouth...or to be accurate, no taste once, and disappointed taste the second time. I'd seen ads saying you could buy slices at Rosati's at lunchtime. Turns out the lunch window is etched in stone. Show up late, and you get nothing. 

Second time, I watched the clock, came on time, and ordered two slices with sausage and onion. No! The horror! Rosati's will not sell you something so complicated. You want a slice? Plain, or pepperoni. Or get out. How hard is it to slap on the topping, add a few dollars to the bill, and make the customer happy?

Apparently it is much too hard, and for that ridiculous policy, my Rosati's days are now over. It didn't help that the men who took my slice order looked at me like I'd ruined their day by coming in, or that they couldn't bother to thank me. 

Ciao, Rosati's. You won't be missed."}
{"text":"First time here! I am impressed!  I was in a hurry and had maybe 10 minutes to eat. I ordered in a hurry and chose the Italian beef and it was amazing! Best sandwich I have had in years. Thank you for impressing me! I am a little bummed there isn't at least a little table out front of this location to sit for 5 minutes.  I ate in my car which wasn't horrible but I didn't open the au jus container fearing it would spill. I couldn't eat it at my next appointment unfortunately LOL. I will definitely be back! The menu is very interesting. I usually get pizza from another restaurant consistently but I may try Rosati's since the offer a thin crust. Great prices and big tasty sandwiches so give it a shot!"}
{"text":"We had to go for a large group and the pizza was just Ok! I am sure it is better in the restaurant or for a smaller order! Thin crust and plenty of toppings! Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and I have to say Rosatis has a very good thin crust pizza. Their sausage also has the seasonings I am accustomed to from back home. I order Rosatis when I'm in the mood for a softer crust and lots of gooey cheese. Lastly, how can you eat pizza without Hot Giardinera peppers? Their peppers are GREAT!"}
{"text":"This was just so not worth it. The pizza was tasteless, overpriced and burnt. So I guess if it had any taste it would be burnt crust taste. We had the margherita and pepperoni pizza, and they skimped on the sauce for both so that there was way too much end crust that tasted...burnt. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza. The crust tastes like cardboard , the sauce has no flavor and the ingredients are not very good. I took one bite and threw it away. 
I can't believe they have so many places in the valley. I guess people don't have the best taste in pizza.
I don't like to write bad reviews, but this is just bad.
To many great pizza places in the valley."}
{"text":"The potential was there... I ordered a deep dish pizza for delivery but when it came, all the cheese and toppings were off the pizza in one corner of the box and the bottom of the box had a big hole in it from where all the grease was leaking through. It seemed like either the delivery guy was taking turns like a formula 1 driver or he just carried the thing on the side. Once I put everything back on the pizza, it was pretty good though. Made a mess everywhere, had to reconstruct the pizza. Delivery guy showed no care for the pizza. Go to oregano's"}
{"text":"I grew up in New York City and went to college in Chicago so I have had a lot of good pizza in the past. This is excellent pizza, great flavor. We got a 16\" pizza with pepperoni and sausage and extra cheese. No decor, but friendly staff. Prices about average, $35 for 12 wings and the pizza, but a lot of food."}
{"text":"I think this pie is awful. I have had it twice and all I got was a 16\" grease pie cut into annoying little squares. When I requested the pie to be cut into a traditional round style, my request was met with a huff and a puff. It's quite pricy too."}
{"text":"neighborhood pizza joint, sure it's a franchise, but when I'm at my folks house we order Rosati's and it's always been good."}
{"text":"I've eaten Rosati's for years and this is the first time I've had a problem with them.  The pizza was cold, slimy and falling apart when we got it.  It was completely inedible; we called to have a replacement pizza delivered and they got lost.  How do you get lost when you were just here!?  I called and spoke to Katie the manager and advised her of my concerns and asked her what had changed because we've always had great pizza and service from Rosati's.  I asked her if this we should expect from now on and her only response was to offer our money back.  Again I asked, frustrated!!!  What has changed and she stated we have new owners.  If this is how the new owners are going to allow food to come out of their kitchen then say goodbye to another business because that will not work in a town inundated with pizza joints..."}
{"text":"I've been ordering pizza from #Rosati's for almost a decade and this particular location has the ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE! We ordered a 1/2 & 1/2 medium pizza that showed up completely wrong and an hour late! I paid 17.55 plus tax and tip. When I called to let them know about the mistake I was told I would have a full credit for my next pizza. Well, I just called to place an order and Shannon the \"Owner\" said I have $12 credit and that she could not do anything about it! Ha the \"Owner\" can't do anything about it? I am amazed at how poorly she handles/manages her establishment and from now on all of my family and hopefully all of you will start ordering pizza from #Sal'sGilbertPizza. Sal's pie is amazing and they treat customers right! Keep the $12 credit Shannon you've lost a loyal longtime customer. Worst service ever! I've just also sent an email to Rosati's corporate office encouraging them to look over the yelp & Google reviews for this location because it doesn't look so great for Shannon. Apparently I'm not the only one who's had a terrible experience with Shannon's location. Too bad she is giving this franchise a bad reputation!"}
{"text":"The best pizza ! This place is right across the street from me and it's dangerous. I am always craving rosatis, which in my opinion is the best pizza in az !!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic lasagna. Service is prompt and food is always hot and fresh.  The beef and cheese sub is huge and delectable. Pizzas are very good as well. It is our go to place to order from."}

{"text":"About a year ago I gave this place a 2-star review because they gave me square cut pizza instead of the requested pie cut. Well AS IT WOULD TURN OUT, now the shoe is on the other foot; I forgot to ask for pie cut and they offered to make a new one, and at no charge for me! 

Me, the idiot: \"Ah, I forgot to ask for it to be pie cut!\"
Them: \"No problem. Do you want us to make another one? It'll take maybe seven or eight minutes.\"
Me, the imbicile: \"Really?\"
Them: \"Look, I treat a pizza cut the same way as a topping. If we made the wrong one, we redo it.\"
Me, the person of decreased mental capacity: \"But I forgot to tell you to make it that way.\"
Them: \"Well, now you have the option.\"

I couldn't believe they would do that for me. The pizza was good, of course. The last time I wrote a review I thought they didn't care. Obviously that's because I was wrong. Very professional service!!

Just don't forget to ask for pie cut if you want it that way!!"}
{"text":"Best Rosatis is Arizona. Always consistent food and very friendly staff. I love the deal they have where you get a free small cheese pizza if you have ordered a large pizza at regular price. They also let you add toppings to the free small pizza at small charge. So I get 2 pizzas every time I order both with 3 toppings and end up paying $26.00 out the door. Very happy customer. I have 2 Rosatis locations closer to me but they do not give you a free small pizza no matter what you buy so I only go to this Rosatis"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and everything I have had has been delicious! The pizza is very tasty, the wings are very flavorful without being greasy and the ribs... Are some of the best I have ever tasted! Oh and you have to order the cannoli!!!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from here for years but recently my last 3 orders have been messed up to the point that I asked if it was under new management. I order for our team at work so usually it's a fairly large order, the last pie was a mess. Cheese all over the place the pizza cut half a$$edly and cold. Then the phone girls are short and talk over you. Unfortunately I'll still order from this place but not as often. Now my team will look for somewhere else to order because we want quality service."}
{"text":"Always fast delivery and always good food. Our family LOVES the fried shrimp !! It's AMAZING!! And the spaghetti is delicious and the garlic cheese bread is fabulous. The Caesar salad was very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza. I ordered a deep dish and basically got a thin crust with rolled up edges. The enire thing was less than a quarter inch thick, was overly salty and the sauce was runny. The dough was dense like a brick as if they forgot to put yeast in it. When I called to ask someone the lady basically said that's how they make it said \"Well I can make it again but it will be the same way\". the tirimisu was still frozen an hour after we ordered it got home and got to it. Save your time, money and don't waste the calories..."}
{"text":"This may be the best pizza you can have delivered in Scottsdale. The sauce, cheese and toppings are all top notch. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra 20% to avoid eating another Domino's or Papa John's Pizza! You can pick it up to save a few dollars on delivery too.

*This place is seriously busy, so expect up to a one-hour wait (it's so worth it)."}
{"text":"Took take out from here today. Very friendly guy at counter helped us order.  I thought this was the other Rosati's I had ordered from and got very tiny chicken parm, so asked to order extra chicken explaining I had ordered chicken and there had been very little chicken. The man said it came with two pieces. So I thought the other place wasn't Rosati's. Turns out it was a different Rosati's. The location makes a huge difference.

I got chicken parm with spaghetti, side salad and garlic bread. We also ordered a pizza.

My mother wanted to check the sauce first and the pizza sauce had tasted spicy to me, and they let us order the pizza with most of the sauce being the one used for the chicken parm. That was very nice of them. We were even given a slice split in half to try later when a regular pizza was done and we were still waiting for our food to see if the sauce was still spicy after being cooked.  Also, a very nice thing to do. It wasn't spicy tasting to me anymore. Maybe being cooked changed it or having all that cheese on top covered it. We got the full pie, and that sauce still tasted better to us. I guess the sauce they use for the chicken parm. is just really great tasting sauce.

The chicken parm was two big pieces and some spaghetti.  It was cooked just right. It tasted great and was soft. The garlic bread also came just right. The right amount of garlic and it was just the right amount of crispness."}
{"text":"I had the build your own pasta with Italian sausage , meat sauce and ricotta it was delicious! Way more food than I could possibly finish in one sitting. The happy hour menu could've been a little better maybe they should add some food or appetizers but Great sauce and great bartenders what more could you ask for"}
{"text":"If negative numbers were allowed I would rank this far lower than one star!  Let me just start by saying I've had excellent pizza here in the past but only after requesting the pizza not to be overcooked which has happened several times. Every time I order I specifically request that the pizza not be overcooked. Once again I received my pizza burnt like charcoal! I called in and the girl who answered the phone listened to me for about a minute then put me on hold to talk to who I'm assuming was the manager Joshua?  He said \" I cut that pizza and it looked fine to me\" This guy needs to find a new job and better customer skills !!! After I demanded another pizza be made it took an additional  hour for it to be delivered.  Over two hours and $30 + dollars later ??? Really 
I am willing to update this Yelp review with a direct phone call from the owner. You should be able to look up my information at the store. Until then shame on you for letting this type of customer service go on. Maybe it's time you read some of the other reviews !!!"}
{"text":"Three stars seems low for this place. Don't let the yellow stars scare you away. I order from this place all time and the pizza is great! Just look at the photo of my latest pepperoni and sausage! A work of cheesy art. Personally, I like to ask for the pizzas to be cooked well done to make sure the cheese has a chance to get golden, brown and delicious, but regardless of how long you ask them to leave it in the oven, when they pull it out, chances are it's going to be delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered from here last week, chicken parm was excellent and my husband has pizza which he enjoyed!  Fast delivery, but expensive but was good food."}
{"text":"This rosatis in my opinion is the best one in the area. Polite employees and the pizza is always right on. If you're looking for a great pizza you have found it!"}
{"text":"Fabulous!  Pizza is just like our neighborhood Rosati's back in Plainfield, IL.  Love the Buffalo wings, pasta, and the bonus is that no matter what time we order, it's always been delivered within 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Just had this place and was extremely disappointed in the Italian beef and the wings.  I've had a good rosati's beef and wings before and this place doesn't even come close.  This place truly made me sick after not able to finish my sandwich or wings.  Thought I would give this place a try since I've heard that this Rosatis is just like being back in Chicago and will not waste my time, money or energy on this place.  The beef has a weird taste to it like it was sitting in the gravy way too long and the wings tasted like they were old and not fresh."}
{"text":"Second time being here and it has not improved. We chalked it up to the place being new the first time because the server was slow and the food took a long time but they were nice and showed they were working on it. This time not so much. The server was short with us like she had something way better to do. The food took 45 minutes and even then  it didn't come out at the same time. You can find better service and better food. Not sure this place is gonna make it."}
{"text":"This is flat out the worst Rosati's I've ordered from in the Phoenix area. Probably had over a 100 pizzas from the Rosati's in Scottsdale over the past 17 years. Always excellent. This one in Surprise is a joke. One delivery took two hours. Asked for the manager. Not here. This time pizza came in an hour. Opened the box and it had been dropped. Toppings all over. Almost inedible. Called and asked for the manager and again, not here. Said they would have him call me the next day. Never heard from them. DON'T ORDER FROM THIS PLACE. THEIR SERVICE IS THE WORST AND THE PIZZAS ARE NOT UP TO ROSAT'S USUAL STANDARDS. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm not a pizza connoisseur like the others??

I'm a fan of their pie and haven't been disappointed yet. It's always ready when they say it will be and it's hard to beat their special - order a large one topping pizza and get a free cheese pizza. That special works out wonderfully for my friends who prefer their slice of heaven sans meat and veggies. Will continue ordering until I find something better that is closer...which I don't think will be anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago, and this is by far one of the most authentic places to get Chicago style pizza. Most of the bad reviews are because of delivery issues. If you are just talking about the food it's pretty good. I recommend the thin crust and the deep dish."}
{"text":"The Bf and I got some take out from this place a few days ago..... not so awesome. We got a double crust (or something to that effect) cheese pizza, a house salad, and garlic bread. The salad seemed old... the lettuce was all brown and wilted and the vegetables in the salad were not very fresh either. I couldn't even eat it. The garlic bread just tasted like buttered bread and the sauce was a bit strange and sweet. The pizza was too chewy and the cheese was thick. The sauce was good, but that was about the only good part of the experience. I wouldn't waste my money here again.... I'd prefer streets of new york for pizza in this area....or just driving to somewhere that's not west mesa for pizza, which is definitely your best bet."}
{"text":"I had a coupon for a free 14\" one topping pizza at this location. So I decided to use it, it's only for carry out (it's a free pizza so obviously no delivery but I wish!)

I have not been to any pizza chains or pizza places in Arizona so this is my first. It says its authentic chicago style so I would expect that means deep dish or maybe it's something else, I wasn't sure. There wasn't lots of pictures on yelps either.

So I called in to place my carry out order. Lady on the phone was nice. She answered my questions. I asked two questions:

1) Do you have white sauce (I usually find Chicago style places don't but I love pizza with the white sauce, it taste so much better in my opinion)? The lady said they only carry the red, marinara sauce. So no big deal.

2) How long does it take? She answered it depends but for my order, it'll be about 25 minutes. 

I live about 6-7 miles away from here so it's not a big deal. 

I placed my order around 1:30pm and I arrived there around 2:15pm. I walked in the store, it was pretty much empty except one couple eating pizza. I stood there and waited for someone to approach the counter. She was nice and responded quickly when I told her I was there for pick-up. She processed everything quickly. I got plates, forks +knives, cheese and red pepper which is something I am always glad pizza places have for carry-out! It looks nice, cool but small place inside. 

Once I got home, it was time to try it! So the pizza box isn't how I expected it to be opened/sealed. It's sealed from the side instead of from the front. It's kinda hard to explain, maybe it's California thing? I just thought I'll prop open the lid but it didn't work that way. I just had to remove the flips from the side instead but this seems to make it more secure or at least I think so. 

Anyways, the first thing that surprised me was the pizza isn't cut in a pie shape! It's cut in squares which I did not expect. So I lifted up one little square and tried it. It was gooey and cheesey - not too shady for a free pizza! I noticed also it looks like it had herbs on top because I see little green flakes of something. The pizza was NOT a deep dish pizza but it wasn't super thin either. It was very cheesy and gooey which I like and it has more flavor than other chain places. But $13.95 for one topping 14\"? Ehhh.. I don't know but mine was free so no complaint. :)

Quick summary:
+Pizza is cheesy, gooey
+Good customer service, responsive, attentive and provides plates, seasonings, forks
+Cool, quiet atmosphere 
-Pricey but it's nothing out of the ordinary in terms of pizza pricing 

Note: The reason I gave it three stars is because the pizza isn't exceptional or extraordinary. It's good but I don't know if I'll care enough to go back (white sauce pizza always wins my heart)."}
{"text":"The world record for the fastest time to eat a 12? pizza is 41.31 seconds.  Think you can beat it? 

I was next door at their brother restaurant, Scotti's, when I saw an innocent yet alluring slice of pepperoni pizza from Rosatti's.  I was hungry and figured that, hey, I can try TWO new places at once (the sacrifices made to be a Yelper, yo).  Plus, I was pretty hungry! My eyes were bigger than my stomach though and I wasn't able to finish both my grilled cheese and my slice of pizza.  Whoops.

Onward with the review: So the pizza was okay.  It was greasy, the crust was doughy, and there wasn't too much cheese drag action.  It was a pretty standard slice and at $3 for a slice, it wasn't bad.  Perhaps I would have had my socks blown off if I wasn't also eating an amazing Ham & Gouda from Scotti's.  That slice of pie definitely took the backseat while I was slamming down my grilled cheese sandwich.

Update: Came back on a later visit to try their Chicago style pie with pan crust, and while it took like 30-35mins, it was amazing! Not my favorite deep dish but it'll fulfil a craving! Giving them another star."}
{"text":"Definitely good deep dish pizza. I just moved to Scottsdale from Houston, didn't want to go the pizza chain route, so I yelped it. Amazing pizza, very filling, a lot of sauce and ingredients. Cheese was at a premium and the young lady at the counter was very helpful. If your looking for a good ole pizza with a lot of cheese and very filling, roll through this spot. Grab a six pack of peroni beer or a nice wine to enjoy with the fine pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome but don't spend your $$ on their cheesecake. What a disappointment. Your better off going to Jack in the Box for prepackaged cheesecake."}
{"text":"I was not at all happy with our food that we ordered for delivery.  We ordered a Cheef sandwich after 45 minutes came with the roll so soggy that it fell apart.  I could tell the the the roll was toasted because the cheese was melted and the beef was burnt on the edges.  The roll was so soggy I couldn't even pick it up.  My boyfriend ordered the meatball sandwich and his roll was ok, but the meatballs couldn't even be cut with the fork that was given to us.  They were hard as rocks.  I would not recommend this place for sandwiches at all.  We are from the northeast and it is really hard to get a good sub out here in Arizona.  This place is another bad one on our list."}
{"text":"Much like a lot of reviewers on here, this place isn't the best.
I can make better homemade pizza with the cheapest of ingredients. 

Our order was for pepperoni, pepperoni and olive, and their white pizza.
The pepperoni was very greasy yet on the bottom of the crust was layered with flour.
The white pizza was the worst. I'm not sure why it tasted sweet but it had a strange sweet flavor to it.
It seems that no matter what it takes an hour to get your order, yet about an hour and 15 mins seems to be the actual estimate.

My kids love pizza, neither of them would eat it. All kids should love pizza. :("}
{"text":"Great Pizzas!!! Their new Pastas are phenomenal!! I know they had a bad manager there in the past but the new manager is very nice! would recommend!"}
{"text":"Came half an hour before closing time, rude employee told me they're closed even though closing time is 11PM. Not to mention I also tried calling for 10-15 minutes before driving there for a pick up order and nobody answered. Bad business."}
{"text":"I LOVE Rosati's... here's a little history... 

When I was little we used to eat at one in Chicago and then we moved to Arizona. When my dad saw there was one on Warner road he was thrilled. Years later when I was old enough, I worked at Rosati's for 4 years (all throughout high school) and ate there as much as possible. For anyone who has worked in the restaurant business, you know the food is good when the staff eats there whether they are working or not. 

I recently introduced my boyfriend to Rosati's and he is now hooked too!! 

The food is always delicious, we've never had an incorrect order, it's always hot and on time, and they simply never disappoint. All of the ingredients are FRESH and everything there is handmade. Keep in mind this is CHICAGO pizza, so if you don't know what that is, don't like it, or are expecting something different, you may have a different opinion. 

Whether you want a pizza, an Italian beef, lasagna, you name it, it's all delicious at this restaurant!! 

On a personal note, I can say that the years I worked there it was family and I'm willing to bet Scott Selke still treats his staff as such. Great food, great owners, and great memories!"}
{"text":"We've been looking for a good pizza place for a while. Rosatis is SO good. I mean really, I\"m so glad we finally found decent pizza. Tried most of their menu, all very good"}
{"text":"So first order with store, delivery was on time. The apps I had where great calamari with sauce and decided on sob pizza cheese is on top of pizza with topping on bottom, not enough sauce (BBQ ) also the edge or crust of the pizza was rock hard and more like a Italian flatbread pizza vs a rolled or developed pizza crust so what happened to the crust it was burnt and hard I could eat only a couple slices also its cut into squares rather then a trad.NY pizza I may re order but  prob will not be the sob pizza"}
{"text":"The pizza was ok.  The big issue for me was the pizza edges came out a bit on the burnt side.  Not sure they should have searched it that way.  However, my real issue with this place was price...$35 bucks for two small pizzas is a bit stiff.  Quite frankly there wasn't $35 in value there.  But more to the point, for $35 I shouldn't be getting a burnt pizza.

Probably a 2.5, but I'm pretty sure its not a 3."}
{"text":"review from a loyal customer. (15 years)

Just coming back after the Recipe was changed. For some reason i will say from April-July.. The Pizza was very bad. Like it was missing something. So i stopped going in. Went to Chicago came back missing the food  and gave Scott a try again.  The Pizza is great again.  So been coming back like i used to. Ordered a Pizza with the 12 box ends deal. 50% off for bringing in 12.  was told a price by Larry. Got there. Was charged on my debit card full price. I forgot the bring in the box ends. They were sitting in my car. If i was reminded i would of gotten them. But Larry just figured to charge full price with out saying. To a customer that is always coming in.   It's just becoming a hassle to come in. The prices are really high, I don't live in the delivery zone or mailing area so i don't get coupons.  They know i drive 20 minutes each way just to get the pizza and don't ever offer a deal or coupon rate. Other then the pizza being great. They give you no appreciation for being a long time loyal customer.  I will miss your pizza but i think its time to try out the other new places I've been passing to be loyal to Scott.   Advice. : If you have somebody that is coming in 2 to 3 times a week to pick up a pizza. Give them a deal every now and then. 100th pizza free or something. And when they do bring in the only forum of coupon they get! .. Make sure they get the deal..  I'll leave you with 3 stars. Because your pizza is great."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Have been looking for a place with great deep dish since my old go to Nellos has been disappointing each time we have going there each of the last 3 times. 

Not only is their deep dish awesome, but their thin crust is so good. 

May have found the new go to deep dish and thin crust place all in one place"}
